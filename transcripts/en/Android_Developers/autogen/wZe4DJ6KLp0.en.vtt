00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079
original game there's actually some new
 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:57.330
original game there's actually some new
game elements you can actually grab

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340
game elements you can actually grab
 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.620
game elements you can actually grab
these blocks over here I throat and you

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630
these blocks over here I throat and you
 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:02.699
these blocks over here I throat and you
can actually use this and that's

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709
can actually use this and that's
 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.319
can actually use this and that's
actually protects you also as you're

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:04.329
actually protects you also as you're
 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:05.909
actually protects you also as you're
running so there's these little

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:05.919
running so there's these little
 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:08.280
running so there's these little
creatures generated zombies come out I

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290
creatures generated zombies come out I
 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.229
creatures generated zombies come out I
don't think so but that's kind of that's

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239
don't think so but that's kind of that's
 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:11.699
don't think so but that's kind of that's
I was kind of cool to see a different

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
I was kind of cool to see a different
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.170
I was kind of cool to see a different
game so you know as I said I would call

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180
game so you know as I said I would call
 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.509
game so you know as I said I would call
it in a homage and it's you know it's

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519
it in a homage and it's you know it's
 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.969
it in a homage and it's you know it's
it's again it's obviously kind of a fun

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:17.979
it's again it's obviously kind of a fun
 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.800
it's again it's obviously kind of a fun
it looks like a fun hobby project and

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810
it looks like a fun hobby project and
 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.800
it looks like a fun hobby project and
cool i like to see fun hobby projects on

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810
cool i like to see fun hobby projects on
 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.570
cool i like to see fun hobby projects on
hundred on google play you know it's

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580
hundred on google play you know it's
 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.250
hundred on google play you know it's
getting a little bit of extra gameplay

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260
getting a little bit of extra gameplay
 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.230
getting a little bit of extra gameplay
absolutely yeah so let's talk about what

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240
absolutely yeah so let's talk about what
 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.110
absolutely yeah so let's talk about what
separates this from what we call a retro

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120
separates this from what we call a retro
 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.080
separates this from what we call a retro
game okay so if you look at the graphics

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090
game okay so if you look at the graphics
 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.570
game okay so if you look at the graphics
there's pieces of this are are

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580
there's pieces of this are are
 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.820
there's pieces of this are are
definitely definitely feel like they

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830
definitely definitely feel like they
 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:40.560
definitely definitely feel like they
were originally written for a 16-bit

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570
were originally written for a 16-bit
 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.310
were originally written for a 16-bit
platform but remember that you know

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320
platform but remember that you know
 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.880
platform but remember that you know
16-bit programmers and artists were

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890
16-bit programmers and artists were
 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:49.440
16-bit programmers and artists were
actually pretty good they did a lot with

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450
actually pretty good they did a lot with
 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.610
actually pretty good they did a lot with
what they had

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620
what they had
 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.170
what they had
if you look back here in the background

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180
if you look back here in the background
 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.580
if you look back here in the background
you know you see this kind of monochrome

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590
you know you see this kind of monochrome
 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.790
you know you see this kind of monochrome
things you know look like they were done

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800
things you know look like they were done
 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.710
things you know look like they were done
in and maybe like paint brush or

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720
in and maybe like paint brush or
 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.310
in and maybe like paint brush or
something I it's it's a far cry from the

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320
something I it's it's a far cry from the
 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.860
something I it's it's a far cry from the
sort of things that you saw in you know

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870
sort of things that you saw in you know
 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.570
sort of things that you saw in you know
being made and deluxe paint for instance

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580
being made and deluxe paint for instance
 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.830
being made and deluxe paint for instance
where every pixel really counted and

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840
where every pixel really counted and
 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.600
where every pixel really counted and
there was a lot of care put into you

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610
there was a lot of care put into you
 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.420
there was a lot of care put into you
each piece of the background yeah so you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430
each piece of the background yeah so you
 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.969
each piece of the background yeah so you
know this is just a solid green this is

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979
know this is just a solid green this is
 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.560
know this is just a solid green this is
you know a little bit textured but not

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570
you know a little bit textured but not
 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.350
you know a little bit textured but not
much just two colors in a van 60 cause

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360
much just two colors in a van 60 cause
 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.909
much just two colors in a van 60 cause
you work but he used as much as they

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:23.919
you work but he used as much as they
 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:25.860
you work but he used as much as they
possibly could oh yeah ever get amounts

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870
possibly could oh yeah ever get amounts
 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:29.100
possibly could oh yeah ever get amounts
of dithering error diffusion just a all

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110
of dithering error diffusion just a all
 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:31.020
of dithering error diffusion just a all
done by hand of course and it was

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.030
done by hand of course and it was
 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.279
done by hand of course and it was
beautiful it was beautiful painstaking

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289
beautiful it was beautiful painstaking
 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.570
beautiful it was beautiful painstaking
work and it required you know artists

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580
work and it required you know artists
 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:34.890
work and it required you know artists
with kind of special skill you know

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900
with kind of special skill you know
 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.110
with kind of special skill you know
nearly um so you know I mean I and I

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120
nearly um so you know I mean I and I
 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.750
nearly um so you know I mean I and I
think that's that that's exactly hit you

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760
think that's that that's exactly hit you
 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:41.279
think that's that that's exactly hit you
hit your head on the nose there also

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:41.289
hit your head on the nose there also
 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:42.570
hit your head on the nose there also
just the fact that you know the graphics

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580
just the fact that you know the graphics
 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.370
just the fact that you know the graphics
are different kind of retro resolutions

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:44.380
are different kind of retro resolutions
 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.719
are different kind of retro resolutions
all over you've got a really retro

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729
all over you've got a really retro
 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.550
all over you've got a really retro
looking tree the mountains are actually

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560
looking tree the mountains are actually
 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.590
looking tree the mountains are actually
higher resolution and the whole thing

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600
higher resolution and the whole thing
 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.320
higher resolution and the whole thing
feels fun but it doesn't it is it does

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
feels fun but it doesn't it is it does
 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.779
feels fun but it doesn't it is it does
it just feels like you know I didn't

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:54.789
it just feels like you know I didn't
 

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:55.830
it just feels like you know I didn't
have time to actually write real

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840
have time to actually write real
 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.290
have time to actually write real
graphics so for my little for my project

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300
graphics so for my little for my project
 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.909
graphics so for my little for my project
I've gone and done this now that being

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919
I've gone and done this now that being
 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:01.909
I've gone and done this now that being
said the parallax scrolling is great

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919
said the parallax scrolling is great
 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:04.020
said the parallax scrolling is great
there's you know the game engine seems

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030
there's you know the game engine seems
 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.120
there's you know the game engine seems
fine you know it's just it's simply a

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130
fine you know it's just it's simply a
 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.460
fine you know it's just it's simply a
question of artwork and you know and and

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470
question of artwork and you know and and
 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.230
question of artwork and you know and and
up also it you know in terms of in

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240
up also it you know in terms of in
 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.430
up also it you know in terms of in
tuning the game and making a game

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440
tuning the game and making a game
 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.930
tuning the game and making a game
actually you know really fun and I think

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:12.940
actually you know really fun and I think
 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.040
actually you know really fun and I think
that's you know that's that's a harder

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050
that's you know that's that's a harder
 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.600
that's you know that's that's a harder
thing for me to say about talked about

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610
thing for me to say about talked about
 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.100
thing for me to say about talked about
you know whether the game was fun if

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110
you know whether the game was fun if
 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:18.540
you know whether the game was fun if
this game looked like this and it just

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550
this game looked like this and it just
 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.760
this game looked like this and it just
played amazingly and it felt really good

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770
played amazingly and it felt really good
 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.110
played amazingly and it felt really good
in the physics felt really great as

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120
in the physics felt really great as
 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.909
in the physics felt really great as
you're running and all that I probably I

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919
you're running and all that I probably I
 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:25.350
you're running and all that I probably I
would have been more excited about it

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360
would have been more excited about it
 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.000
would have been more excited about it
but as it is it's just it's kind of fun

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010
but as it is it's just it's kind of fun
 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:28.860
but as it is it's just it's kind of fun
to look at it works well on I'll tell

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870
to look at it works well on I'll tell
 

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:30.150
to look at it works well on I'll tell
you what would happen if this game

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:30.160
you what would happen if this game
 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.950
you what would happen if this game
played amazingly well like it was just a

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:31.960
played amazingly well like it was just a
 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.900
played amazingly well like it was just a
really really fun game to play and it's

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:33.910
really really fun game to play and it's
 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.990
really really fun game to play and it's
not terribly i mean it just needs polish

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000
not terribly i mean it just needs polish
 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.350
not terribly i mean it just needs polish
right yes if it did play that well you

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360
right yes if it did play that well you
 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.659
right yes if it did play that well you
know what would happen is you would

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669
know what would happen is you would
 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.180
know what would happen is you would
almost certainly find a set of artists

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:45.190
almost certainly find a set of artists
 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.550
almost certainly find a set of artists
that are willing to help you out and I'm

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560
that are willing to help you out and I'm
 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.050
that are willing to help you out and I'm
sort of time yeah i mean this this car

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.060
sort of time yeah i mean this this car
 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.060
sort of time yeah i mean this this car
is sort of this game is sort of like

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:51.070
is sort of this game is sort of like
 

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:54.570
is sort of this game is sort of like
Ian's car you know it you know except

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580
Ian's car you know it you know except
 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:56.339
Ian's car you know it you know except
that Ian's car was actually awesome in

00:06:56.339 --> 00:06:56.349
that Ian's car was actually awesome in
 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.459
that Ian's car was actually awesome in
1995 well while while this game wouldn't

00:06:59.459 --> 00:06:59.469
1995 well while while this game wouldn't
 

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:00.230
1995 well while while this game wouldn't
have been awesome

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240

prius i actually like yeah i like it
like if you tried it like you took a

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:13.830
like if you tried it like you took a
 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.170
like if you tried it like you took a
toyota prius and tried to make it like

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:15.180
toyota prius and tried to make it like
 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.029
toyota prius and tried to make it like
it was made in 1995 I don't know circuit

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:17.039
it was made in 1995 I don't know circuit
 

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:18.409
it was made in 1995 I don't know circuit
anyways tell you that does that don't

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:18.419
anyways tell you that does that don't
 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:19.670
anyways tell you that does that don't
that analogy doesn't work at all let's

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680
that analogy doesn't work at all let's
 

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.490
that analogy doesn't work at all let's
go to the next game so the next game on

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500
go to the next game so the next game on
 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.010
go to the next game so the next game on
this list is uh actually i'm gonna guess

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020
this list is uh actually i'm gonna guess
 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.219
this list is uh actually i'm gonna guess
which one would be anything you want in

00:07:28.219 --> 00:07:28.229
which one would be anything you want in
 

00:07:28.229 --> 00:07:31.040
which one would be anything you want in
particular we did no no no well so i

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.050
particular we did no no no well so i
 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:32.870
particular we did no no no well so i
think we should talk about a few of the

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880
think we should talk about a few of the
 

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.649
think we should talk about a few of the
ones so like cash or card katra crash or

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:36.659
ones so like cash or card katra crash or
 

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:42.370
ones so like cash or card katra crash or
crash so um i looked at this game and

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:42.380
crash so um i looked at this game and
 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:47.300
crash so um i looked at this game and
honestly I couldn't really bring myself

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:47.310
honestly I couldn't really bring myself
 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.909
honestly I couldn't really bring myself
to play it very much I kind of never

00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919
to play it very much I kind of never
 

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:52.309
to play it very much I kind of never
really figured the game play out it's

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319
really figured the game play out it's
 

00:07:52.319 --> 00:07:53.839
really figured the game play out it's
very very as far as I can tell it's kind

00:07:53.839 --> 00:07:53.849
very very as far as I can tell it's kind
 

00:07:53.849 --> 00:07:57.129
very very as far as I can tell it's kind
of pretty simple you basically have a

00:07:57.129 --> 00:07:57.139
of pretty simple you basically have a
 

00:07:57.139 --> 00:07:59.719
of pretty simple you basically have a
studt you can see you actually have in

00:07:59.719 --> 00:07:59.729
studt you can see you actually have in
 

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:01.159
studt you can see you actually have in
the middle of a game here it does lie at

00:08:01.159 --> 00:08:01.169
the middle of a game here it does lie at
 

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.080
the middle of a game here it does lie at
least sit nicely save your game state as

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.090
least sit nicely save your game state as
 

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:04.730

far as i can tell you i have ten dollars

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740
far as i can tell you i have ten dollars
 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:06.770
far as i can tell you i have ten dollars
and i can do something like by one

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780
and i can do something like by one
 

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:09.709
and i can do something like by one
potato here at these different prices

00:08:09.709 --> 00:08:09.719
potato here at these different prices
 

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:12.879
potato here at these different prices
and then eventually the price will go up

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:12.889
and then eventually the price will go up
 

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:15.110
and then eventually the price will go up
hopefully oh i just lost everything

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:15.120
hopefully oh i just lost everything
 

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.029
hopefully oh i just lost everything
because the price went down to zero so

00:08:17.029 --> 00:08:17.039
because the price went down to zero so
 

00:08:17.039 --> 00:08:18.620
because the price went down to zero so
the key thing is to sort of will follow

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:18.630
the key thing is to sort of will follow
 

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.980
the key thing is to sort of will follow
the trends of the market to buy and sell

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:20.990
the trends of the market to buy and sell
 

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.890
the trends of the market to buy and sell
and I looked at it was like this is just

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:24.900
and I looked at it was like this is just
 

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.100
and I looked at it was like this is just
not very interesting or compelling but

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.110
not very interesting or compelling but
 

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.409
not very interesting or compelling but
it could be it could be it yeah you know

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:30.419
it could be it could be it yeah you know
 

00:08:30.419 --> 00:08:33.740
it could be it could be it yeah you know
we have seen a lot of games that we

00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:33.750
we have seen a lot of games that we
 

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:36.110
we have seen a lot of games that we
thought were terrible and it turns out

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120
thought were terrible and it turns out
 

00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:40.219
thought were terrible and it turns out
that a lot of it is just in the fine

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:40.229
that a lot of it is just in the fine
 

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.370
that a lot of it is just in the fine
tuning and in the presentation so for

whether or not you can turn this into

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:03.420
whether or not you can turn this into
 

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.079

the addictive style of gameplay that
would make it top grossing is sort of up

00:09:09.050 --> 00:09:09.060
would make it top grossing is sort of up
 

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:10.319
would make it top grossing is sort of up
in the air

00:09:10.319 --> 00:09:10.329
in the air
 

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:11.609
in the air
think we've really played it enough so I

00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:11.619
think we've really played it enough so I
 

00:09:11.619 --> 00:09:13.199
think we've really played it enough so I
think it definitely does need some

00:09:13.199 --> 00:09:13.209
think it definitely does need some
 

00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:15.389
think it definitely does need some
tweaking yeah but the main thing it

00:09:15.389 --> 00:09:15.399
tweaking yeah but the main thing it
 

00:09:15.399 --> 00:09:17.699
tweaking yeah but the main thing it
needs is better presentation especially

00:09:17.699 --> 00:09:17.709
needs is better presentation especially
 

00:09:17.709 --> 00:09:20.189
needs is better presentation especially
presentation that sucks people in so

00:09:20.189 --> 00:09:20.199
presentation that sucks people in so
 

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:21.600
presentation that sucks people in so
they want to keep playing even when they

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:21.610
they want to keep playing even when they
 

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:24.389
they want to keep playing even when they
don't know how yet and then teaches them

00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399
don't know how yet and then teaches them
 

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:26.129
don't know how yet and then teaches them
how to play so they can feel like

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:26.139
how to play so they can feel like
 

00:09:26.139 --> 00:09:29.100
how to play so they can feel like
they've progressed yeah I kind of looked

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.110
they've progressed yeah I kind of looked
 

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.079
they've progressed yeah I kind of looked
at it and I didn't completely understand

00:09:31.079 --> 00:09:31.089
at it and I didn't completely understand
 

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:32.970
at it and I didn't completely understand
what all would with these four columns

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:32.980
what all would with these four columns
 

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.410
what all would with these four columns
or four it looks like I by a different

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:34.420
or four it looks like I by a different
 

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.239
or four it looks like I by a different
tiers and the goal is to get myself up

00:09:36.239 --> 00:09:36.249
tiers and the goal is to get myself up
 

00:09:36.249 --> 00:09:37.530
tiers and the goal is to get myself up
to these higher tiers where I can make

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:37.540
to these higher tiers where I can make
 

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.809
to these higher tiers where I can make
more and more money off of different

00:09:39.809 --> 00:09:39.819
more and more money off of different
 

00:09:39.819 --> 00:09:41.309
more and more money off of different
Lots but there's also the ability to buy

00:09:41.309 --> 00:09:41.319
Lots but there's also the ability to buy
 

00:09:41.319 --> 00:09:43.679
Lots but there's also the ability to buy
ten of one lot so it was unclear why you

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:43.689
ten of one lot so it was unclear why you
 

00:09:43.689 --> 00:09:45.689
ten of one lot so it was unclear why you
would just buy tons of this first column

00:09:45.689 --> 00:09:45.699
would just buy tons of this first column
 

00:09:45.699 --> 00:09:47.429
would just buy tons of this first column
maybe there's less risk in the third

00:09:47.429 --> 00:09:47.439
maybe there's less risk in the third
 

00:09:47.439 --> 00:09:48.689
maybe there's less risk in the third
columns there just wasn't it wasn't

00:09:48.689 --> 00:09:48.699
columns there just wasn't it wasn't
 

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:50.939
columns there just wasn't it wasn't
really clear to me why the game was set

00:09:50.939 --> 00:09:50.949
really clear to me why the game was set
 

00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:53.669
really clear to me why the game was set
up this way and it's yeah so that's go

00:09:53.669 --> 00:09:53.679
up this way and it's yeah so that's go
 

00:09:53.679 --> 00:09:56.850
up this way and it's yeah so that's go
ahead and move on because the we do have

00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:56.860
ahead and move on because the we do have
 

00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:59.869
ahead and move on because the we do have
a lot to get through mm-hmm I think that

00:09:59.869 --> 00:09:59.879
a lot to get through mm-hmm I think that
 

00:09:59.879 --> 00:10:02.460
a lot to get through mm-hmm I think that
in general this this game just needs to

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:02.470
in general this this game just needs to
 

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:05.850
in general this this game just needs to
be a lot more self-explanatory and a lot

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:05.860
be a lot more self-explanatory and a lot
 

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.419
be a lot more self-explanatory and a lot
more polished yeah you know it and it is

00:10:09.419 --> 00:10:09.429
more polished yeah you know it and it is
 

00:10:09.429 --> 00:10:13.289
more polished yeah you know it and it is
it is a simple game but but you know

00:10:13.289 --> 00:10:13.299
it is a simple game but but you know
 

00:10:13.299 --> 00:10:15.179
it is a simple game but but you know
certainly simply people like it so I

00:10:15.179 --> 00:10:15.189
certainly simply people like it so I
 

00:10:15.189 --> 00:10:16.679
certainly simply people like it so I
mean I think it was worth continuing on

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:16.689
mean I think it was worth continuing on
 

00:10:16.689 --> 00:10:19.229
mean I think it was worth continuing on
but you know in terms of whether you

00:10:19.229 --> 00:10:19.239
but you know in terms of whether you
 

00:10:19.239 --> 00:10:21.210
but you know in terms of whether you
know if the editorial board looked at

00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:21.220
know if the editorial board looked at
 

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:23.549
know if the editorial board looked at
this they would be like uh well yeah

00:10:23.549 --> 00:10:23.559

yeah that does help a lot um I would

00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:05.050
yeah that does help a lot um I would
 

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:06.300
yeah that does help a lot um I would
actually say one thing is would be

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:06.310
actually say one thing is would be
 

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:08.790
actually say one thing is would be
really really great is if you see that

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800
really really great is if you see that
 

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.950
really really great is if you see that
you're running on an extra large screen

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:10.960
you're running on an extra large screen
 

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.360
you're running on an extra large screen
device like a tablet it'd be kind of

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:12.370
device like a tablet it'd be kind of
 

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:14.550
device like a tablet it'd be kind of
awesome too yeah just to set up this

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560
awesome too yeah just to set up this
 

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.110
awesome too yeah just to set up this
config that was actually one of my first

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:16.120
config that was actually one of my first
 

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.570
config that was actually one of my first
comments was that was that having the

00:14:18.570 --> 00:14:18.580
comments was that was that having the
 

00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:20.340
comments was that was that having the
having this config be you know sort of

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:20.350
having this config be you know sort of
 

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:21.870
having this config be you know sort of
automatic so allowing in a change is

00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:21.880
automatic so allowing in a change is
 

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.220
automatic so allowing in a change is
great because not everyone is going to

00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:23.230
great because not everyone is going to
 

00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:25.290
great because not everyone is going to
agree on the same control scheme but

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:25.300
agree on the same control scheme but
 

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:27.180
agree on the same control scheme but
it's so easy to detect it it's an extra

00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:27.190
it's so easy to detect it it's an extra
 

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:29.220
it's so easy to detect it it's an extra
large display and and you know it's a

00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:29.230
large display and and you know it's a
 

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:31.019
large display and and you know it's a
great idea yeah so it'd be cool to do

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:31.029
great idea yeah so it'd be cool to do
 

00:14:31.029 --> 00:14:32.160
great idea yeah so it'd be cool to do
and it's actually I mean the way I would

00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:32.170
and it's actually I mean the way I would
 

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.870
and it's actually I mean the way I would
probably do it is I would just create a

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:33.880
probably do it is I would just create a
 

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.970
probably do it is I would just create a
environment variable that got triggered

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:35.980
environment variable that got triggered
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.500
environment variable that got triggered
if you detect it either large or

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:37.510
if you detect it either large or
 

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:39.840
if you detect it either large or
extra-large or in terms of Android now

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:39.850
extra-large or in terms of Android now
 

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.780
extra-large or in terms of Android now
we're looking at the minimum screen

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:42.790
we're looking at the minimum screen
 

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.290
we're looking at the minimum screen
width of 600 the SW 600 variable you can

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:46.300
width of 600 the SW 600 variable you can
 

00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:48.120
width of 600 the SW 600 variable you can
trigger that off of actually something

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:48.130
trigger that off of actually something
 

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:49.890
trigger that off of actually something
in the resource fork so it's pretty it's

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:49.900
in the resource fork so it's pretty it's
 

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.690
in the resource fork so it's pretty it's
really really easy to do to just use the

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:51.700
really really easy to do to just use the
 

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.560

you can actually bounce off the walls so
 

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.310
you can actually bounce off the walls so
you actually go through a kind of a

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:28.320
you actually go through a kind of a
 

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:29.690
you actually go through a kind of a
crazy turn you can actually you can't

00:16:29.690 --> 00:16:29.700
crazy turn you can actually you can't
 

00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:31.130
crazy turn you can actually you can't
actually bounce off the walls and it's

00:16:31.130 --> 00:16:31.140
actually bounce off the walls and it's
 

00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:32.840
actually bounce off the walls and it's
not in this particular in this

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:32.850
not in this particular in this
 

00:16:32.850 --> 00:16:35.210
not in this particular in this
particular level it's actually doesn't

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:35.220

it doesn't immediately kill you can
 

00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.490
it doesn't immediately kill you can
actually kind of take advantage of that

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500
actually kind of take advantage of that
 

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.130
actually kind of take advantage of that
the other point is also which is cool

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.140

really the only thing that in my mind it
that prevents this game from from going

that prevents this game from from going
 

00:16:53.070 --> 00:16:55.010
that prevents this game from from going
on and being like one of the top titles

00:16:55.010 --> 00:16:55.020
on and being like one of the top titles
 

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.920
on and being like one of the top titles

the cars are actually quite good
 

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.670
the cars are actually quite good
especially when you see them at scale in

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:10.680
especially when you see them at scale in
 

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.560

00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:12.570
the game oh we just want to take some
 

00:17:12.570 --> 00:17:18.140
the game oh we just want to take some
eyes okay we'll go grab that but but

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:18.150
eyes okay we'll go grab that but but
 

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:20.530
eyes okay we'll go grab that but but
what I really want to see is kind of the

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:20.540
what I really want to see is kind of the
 

00:17:20.540 --> 00:17:22.430
what I really want to see is kind of the
the neck kind of the next level

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:22.440
the neck kind of the next level
 

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.720
the neck kind of the next level
especially when terms that comes to the

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:23.730
especially when terms that comes to the
 

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:25.040
especially when terms that comes to the
background textures and stuff like that

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.050
background textures and stuff like that
 

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.720
background textures and stuff like that
especially since there's so much there's

00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:26.730
especially since there's so much there's
 

00:17:26.730 --> 00:17:28.460
especially since there's so much there's
so many good freely available when it

so many good freely available when it
 

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:30.230
so many good freely available when it
comes to background textures that's the

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240
comes to background textures that's the
 

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.930
comes to background textures that's the
easiest thing to go and get you know in

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940
easiest thing to go and get you know in
 

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.700
easiest thing to go and get you know in
terms of in terms of being able to go

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:34.710

one of those things where it's mixed
because when you mix art styles and you

00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:48.570
because when you mix art styles and you
 

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:49.090
because when you mix art styles and you
get

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.100

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.710
get
I obvious but you're already mixing our

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:50.720
I obvious but you're already mixing our
 

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.270
I obvious but you're already mixing our
tiles here in terms of the teton away

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:52.280
tiles here in terms of the teton away
 

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.310
tiles here in terms of the teton away
the textures in the car later yeah and

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320
the textures in the car later yeah and
 

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.430
the textures in the car later yeah and
and certainly the the textures so what's

00:17:57.430 --> 00:17:57.440
and certainly the the textures so what's
 

00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:00.039
and certainly the the textures so what's
the conceit here is this a is this like

00:18:00.039 --> 00:18:00.049
the conceit here is this a is this like
 

00:18:00.049 --> 00:18:03.669
the conceit here is this a is this like
radio controlled model cars or is it

00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679
radio controlled model cars or is it
 

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:06.190
radio controlled model cars or is it
supposed to be full-size cars yeah I

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:06.200
supposed to be full-size cars yeah I
 

00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:10.090
supposed to be full-size cars yeah I
think it's more like a mix of them I've

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:10.100
think it's more like a mix of them I've
 

00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.560
think it's more like a mix of them I've
I I must admit that I I wasn't able to

00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:14.570
I I must admit that I I wasn't able to
 

00:18:14.570 --> 00:18:19.779
I I must admit that I I wasn't able to
decide if I were going with remote

00:18:19.779 --> 00:18:19.789
decide if I were going with remote
 

00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:22.750
decide if I were going with remote
controlled models or full-size models so

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:22.760
controlled models or full-size models so
 

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:25.360
controlled models or full-size models so
it's kind of both actually they're kind

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:25.370
it's kind of both actually they're kind
 

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.010
it's kind of both actually they're kind
of cartoony little cars which is fine

00:18:27.010 --> 00:18:27.020
of cartoony little cars which is fine
 

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:29.140
of cartoony little cars which is fine
there you know and the track definitely

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:29.150
there you know and the track definitely
 

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:31.060
there you know and the track definitely
feels like I mean you never see a real

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:31.070
feels like I mean you never see a real
 

00:18:31.070 --> 00:18:33.549
feels like I mean you never see a real
world track at scale that way but it

00:18:33.549 --> 00:18:33.559
world track at scale that way but it
 

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:35.140
world track at scale that way but it
does look like the kind of thing that

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:35.150
does look like the kind of thing that
 

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:38.049
does look like the kind of thing that
you might find you know in a I would

00:18:38.049 --> 00:18:38.059
you might find you know in a I would
 

00:18:38.059 --> 00:18:39.520
you might find you know in a I would
have seemed very expensive remote

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:39.530
have seemed very expensive remote
 

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.100
have seemed very expensive remote
control facility yeah I want I want to

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:42.110
control facility yeah I want I want to
 

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:43.960
control facility yeah I want I want to
take away this remark in coach r ya car

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:43.970
take away this remark in coach r ya car
 

00:18:43.970 --> 00:18:45.549
take away this remark in coach r ya car
track I'd be all right because it looks

00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559
track I'd be all right because it looks
 

00:18:45.559 --> 00:18:46.870
track I'd be all right because it looks
like cobblestones yeah a little bit

00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880
like cobblestones yeah a little bit
 

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:49.810
like cobblestones yeah a little bit
totally um so yeah I don't I got have as

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:49.820
totally um so yeah I don't I got have as
 

00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:51.490
totally um so yeah I don't I got have as
big of a problem with the with the

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:51.500
big of a problem with the with the
 

00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.200
big of a problem with the with the
background what's most like that it's

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:53.210
background what's most like that it's
 

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:54.490
background what's most like that it's
mostly not the bottoms he's mostly the

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:54.500
mostly not the bottoms he's mostly the
 

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.830
mostly not the bottoms he's mostly the
mountains though the rocks around it any

00:18:56.830 --> 00:18:56.840
mountains though the rocks around it any
 

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.289
mountains though the rocks around it any
kind of the restive backdrop the ground

00:18:59.289 --> 00:18:59.299
kind of the restive backdrop the ground
 

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:00.730
kind of the restive backdrop the ground
is is different looks distinctly

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:00.740
is is different looks distinctly
 

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:03.039
is is different looks distinctly
different than the cars but you know i'd

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:03.049
different than the cars but you know i'd
 

00:19:03.049 --> 00:19:04.539
different than the cars but you know i'd
love to see i'd love to see a little

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:04.549
love to see i'd love to see a little
 

00:19:04.549 --> 00:19:06.010
love to see i'd love to see a little
more detail in the stuff around the

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:06.020
more detail in the stuff around the
 

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.270
more detail in the stuff around the
other thing that's going to make a big

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:07.280
other thing that's going to make a big
 

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.950
other thing that's going to make a big
difference in a racing game like this is

00:19:08.950 --> 00:19:08.960
difference in a racing game like this is
 

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.560
difference in a racing game like this is
is some actual contact shadows under the

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:11.570
is some actual contact shadows under the
 

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.130
is some actual contact shadows under the
wheels you're doing in shadows but just

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.140
wheels you're doing in shadows but just
 

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.500
wheels you're doing in shadows but just
yeah get the ambient included on the

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:17.510
yeah get the ambient included on the
 

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:19.360
yeah get the ambient included on the
road around the wheels and then you'll

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:19.370
road around the wheels and then you'll
 

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:20.680
road around the wheels and then you'll
really be able to tell how far off the

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:20.690
really be able to tell how far off the
 

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:24.700
really be able to tell how far off the
ground it is yeah aside from what you

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:24.710
ground it is yeah aside from what you
 

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:28.870
ground it is yeah aside from what you
can see there there are also like

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880
can see there there are also like
 

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.310
can see there there are also like
another five different environments

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320
another five different environments
 

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.649
another five different environments
which each cup has a different

00:19:35.649 --> 00:19:35.659
which each cup has a different
 

00:19:35.659 --> 00:19:37.779
which each cup has a different
environment so there are more

00:19:37.779 --> 00:19:37.789
environment so there are more
 

00:19:37.789 --> 00:19:41.470
environment so there are more
environments on as long as you play on

00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480
environments on as long as you play on
 

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.950
environments on as long as you play on
the carrier mode and you every career

00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960
the carrier mode and you every career
 

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.460
the carrier mode and you every career
you you play you unlock another level

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:48.470
you you play you unlock another level
 

00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:51.970
you you play you unlock another level
another car so you can vary your player

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:51.980
another car so you can vary your player
 

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:56.740
another car so you can vary your player
a little own future cars there are nice

00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:56.750
a little own future cars there are nice
 

00:19:56.750 --> 00:19:59.740
a little own future cars there are nice
tools also and do a different type of

00:19:59.740 --> 00:19:59.750
tools also and do a different type of
 

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.820
tools also and do a different type of
mind so I try

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:01.830
mind so I try
 

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:04.190
mind so I try
two very little to gameplay as a player

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200
two very little to gameplay as a player
 

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.289
two very little to gameplay as a player
is progressing through the game it

00:20:06.289 --> 00:20:06.299
is progressing through the game it
 

00:20:06.299 --> 00:20:07.610
is progressing through the game it
sounds like a lot of but you know what

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:07.620
sounds like a lot of but you know what
 

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:10.460
sounds like a lot of but you know what
has reminds me of racing destruction

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:10.470
has reminds me of racing destruction
 

00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:14.389
has reminds me of racing destruction
said totally that no I haven't it I'm

00:20:14.389 --> 00:20:14.399
said totally that no I haven't it I'm
 

00:20:14.399 --> 00:20:16.850
said totally that no I haven't it I'm
probably a lot younger than I came out

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:16.860
probably a lot younger than I came out
 

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:21.590
probably a lot younger than I came out
in 1986 yeah something like that yeah it

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:21.600
in 1986 yeah something like that yeah it
 

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:23.330
in 1986 yeah something like that yeah it
was in the mid eighties yeah it was very

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:23.340
was in the mid eighties yeah it was very
 

00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:25.549
was in the mid eighties yeah it was very
similar where you got it you know these

00:20:25.549 --> 00:20:25.559
similar where you got it you know these
 

00:20:25.559 --> 00:20:27.380
similar where you got it you know these
little tiny cars yeah actually they had

00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:27.390
little tiny cars yeah actually they had
 

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:29.450
little tiny cars yeah actually they had
a track construction it was the band the

00:20:29.450 --> 00:20:29.460
a track construction it was the band the
 

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:31.549
a track construction it was the band the
cars and it was racing destruction set

00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559
cars and it was racing destruction set
 

00:20:31.559 --> 00:20:33.950
cars and it was racing destruction set
that was the mid 80s right there we all

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:33.960

possible you try to use a lot of memory
and since you have that many devices and

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:47.450
and since you have that many devices and
 

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.270

you're trying to be as much back
backward compatible as you can I think

you experiments at all with using

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:04.490
you experiments at all with using
 

00:24:04.490 --> 00:24:09.760
you experiments at all with using
texture compression ah I need to check

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:09.770
texture compression ah I need to check
 

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.670
texture compression ah I need to check
that I I think in my testers are a

00:24:12.670 --> 00:24:12.680
that I I think in my testers are a
 

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.340

open shell too yeah the one because

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:18.050
open shell too yeah the one because
 

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:19.900
open shell too yeah the one because
because basically most most of

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:19.910

if you're using textures that don't have

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:21.860
if you're using textures that don't have
 

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.200
if you're using textures that don't have
alpha it looks like a bunch of your

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:23.210
alpha it looks like a bunch of your
 

00:24:23.210 --> 00:24:26.920
alpha it looks like a bunch of your
stone most of devices will support ET c

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:26.930
stone most of devices will support ET c
 

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:28.450
stone most of devices will support ET c
1 texture compression and that allows

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:28.460
1 texture compression and that allows
 

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.950
1 texture compression and that allows
that actually allows you to reduce the

00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960
that actually allows you to reduce the
 

00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.070
that actually allows you to reduce the
amount of memory in video memory that

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:33.080
amount of memory in video memory that
 

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.540
amount of memory in video memory that
the texture is going to take but if I

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:34.550
the texture is going to take but if I
 

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:36.820
the texture is going to take but if I
recall the samsung galaxy s2 doesn't

00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:36.830
recall the samsung galaxy s2 doesn't
 

00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:38.710
recall the samsung galaxy s2 doesn't
support them no it does it does it does

00:24:38.710 --> 00:24:38.720
support them no it does it does it does
 

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.660
support them no it does it does it does
yeah it supports gonna check on that

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:40.670
yeah it supports gonna check on that
 

00:24:40.670 --> 00:24:42.310
yeah it supports gonna check on that
yeah so that might be something to look

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320
yeah so that might be something to look
 

00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:44.080
yeah so that might be something to look
at to help to help you to optimize

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:44.090
at to help to help you to optimize
 

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:46.030
at to help to help you to optimize
memory a little bit and also will give

00:24:46.030 --> 00:24:46.040
memory a little bit and also will give
 

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.550
memory a little bit and also will give
you a little boost in fill rate because

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:48.560
you a little boost in fill rate because
 

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.950
you a little boost in fill rate because
it also reduces since it decompresses as

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960
it also reduces since it decompresses as
 

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.870
it also reduces since it decompresses as
it fills it actually it actually it

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880
it fills it actually it actually it
 

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.820
it fills it actually it actually it
reduces the size of the copy of the

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:54.830
reduces the size of the copy of the
 

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.530
reduces the size of the copy of the
texture so it it actually gives you a

00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:56.540
texture so it it actually gives you a
 

00:24:56.540 --> 00:24:58.060
texture so it it actually gives you a
little boost in fill rate too so it's

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:58.070
little boost in fill rate too so it's
 

00:24:58.070 --> 00:24:59.950
little boost in fill rate too so it's
worth looking into especially if you

00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960
worth looking into especially if you
 

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.270
worth looking into especially if you
have a bunch of textures that don't have

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:01.280
have a bunch of textures that don't have
 

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.250
have a bunch of textures that don't have
alpha built into them so what was I

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:03.260
alpha built into them so what was I
 

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:04.870
alpha built into them so what was I
thinking oo is it's that it doesn't

00:25:04.870 --> 00:25:04.880
thinking oo is it's that it doesn't
 

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.330
thinking oo is it's that it doesn't
support anything but ET c 1 right right

00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:07.340
support anything but ET c 1 right right
 

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:09.700
support anything but ET c 1 right right
so there are other other formats to like

00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:09.710
so there are other other formats to like
 

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.350
so there are other other formats to like
the XTC that are that are supported in

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:11.360

built into the texture etc1 will

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720
built into the texture etc1 will
 

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.450
built into the texture etc1 will
compress it very well but if it's like

00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:25.460
compress it very well but if it's like
 

00:25:25.460 --> 00:25:27.100
compress it very well but if it's like
your background texture for the ground

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:27.110
your background texture for the ground
 

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.320
your background texture for the ground
that looks to me like it would compress

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.330
that looks to me like it would compress
 

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.560
that looks to me like it would compress
with very very little loss in quality in

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:32.570
with very very little loss in quality in
 

00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:34.450

Mac which I found to be utterly

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120
Mac which I found to be utterly
 

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:13.990
Mac which I found to be utterly
addictive yeah then makes great game so

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000
addictive yeah then makes great game so
 

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.270
addictive yeah then makes great game so
this game it uses accelerometer for play

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:16.280
this game it uses accelerometer for play
 

00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:20.590
this game it uses accelerometer for play
and it looks just great on tablets you

00:26:20.590 --> 00:26:20.600
and it looks just great on tablets you
 

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:22.750
and it looks just great on tablets you
can see here that it's it's just it's

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:22.760
can see here that it's it's just it's
 

00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:24.730
can see here that it's it's just it's
just awesome looking like the graphics

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:24.740
just awesome looking like the graphics
 

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.500
just awesome looking like the graphics
are really high resolution I you know

00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:26.510
are really high resolution I you know
 

00:26:26.510 --> 00:26:28.150

you'll really get to see kind of you

00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:30.150
you'll really get to see kind of you
 

00:26:30.150 --> 00:26:32.420
you'll really get to see kind of you
what this is looking like and you know

00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:32.430
what this is looking like and you know
 

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.130
what this is looking like and you know
the interface is very intuitive and

00:26:34.130 --> 00:26:34.140
the interface is very intuitive and
 

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.470
the interface is very intuitive and
again you know it's getting 60 frames

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480
again you know it's getting 60 frames
 

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.120
again you know it's getting 60 frames

00:26:38.130 --> 00:26:40.400
per second here on my transformer prime
now but you'll notice that as I turn the

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:40.410
now but you'll notice that as I turn the
 

00:26:40.410 --> 00:26:42.140
now but you'll notice that as I turn the
tablet to try to try to make him swing

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:42.150
tablet to try to try to make him swing
 

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.270
tablet to try to try to make him swing
it actually doesn't work and the reason

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:44.280
it actually doesn't work and the reason
 

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.390
it actually doesn't work and the reason
why is that this tablet is a landscape

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:47.400
why is that this tablet is a landscape
 

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.670
why is that this tablet is a landscape
default device and the way the

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:49.680
default device and the way the
 

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.100
default device and the way the
accelerometer and Android works is it

00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:52.110
accelerometer and Android works is it
 

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.080
accelerometer and Android works is it
actually gives you coordinates that are

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:54.090
actually gives you coordinates that are
 

00:26:54.090 --> 00:26:55.730
actually gives you coordinates that are
that are based upon the default

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740
that are based upon the default
 

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:59.000
that are based upon the default
orientation of the device so as a game

00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.010
orientation of the device so as a game

developer what you actually need to do

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:00.690
developer what you actually need to do
 

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.020
developer what you actually need to do
is translate and there's actually

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:03.030
is translate and there's actually
 

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.850
is translate and there's actually
functions that are built into the SDK to

functions that are built into the SDK to
 

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:07.400
functions that are built into the SDK to
help you out with this but this may

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:07.410
help you out with this but this may
 

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:09.170
help you out with this but this may
shock you there i'm actually going to

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:09.180
shock you there i'm actually going to
 

00:27:09.180 --> 00:27:11.180
shock you there i'm actually going to
refer you to the nvidia website because

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:11.190
refer you to the nvidia website because
 

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.800
refer you to the nvidia website because
they actually have the best article on

00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:12.810
they actually have the best article on
 

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:16.070
they actually have the best article on
how to take these accelerometer

00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080
how to take these accelerometer
 

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.270
how to take these accelerometer
coordinates which are either going to be

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:17.280
coordinates which are either going to be
 

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:21.140
coordinates which are either going to be
based on portrait or landscape depending

00:27:21.140 --> 00:27:21.150
based on portrait or landscape depending
 

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.910
based on portrait or landscape depending
on the default orientation and turn them

00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:22.920
on the default orientation and turn them
 

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:25.070
on the default orientation and turn them
into a general solution that will work

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:25.080
into a general solution that will work
 

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.810
into a general solution that will work
across all devices without you having to

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820
across all devices without you having to
 

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.000
across all devices without you having to
care about the orientation it turns out

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:29.010
care about the orientation it turns out
 

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:30.980
care about the orientation it turns out
that it's simpler the most people thing

00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:30.990
that it's simpler the most people thing
 

00:27:30.990 --> 00:27:32.900
that it's simpler the most people thing
and in fact where most people go wrong

00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:32.910
and in fact where most people go wrong
 

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.510
and in fact where most people go wrong
is trying to find out too much of it

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520
is trying to find out too much of it
 

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:37.730
is trying to find out too much of it
about the device and trying to be too

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:37.740
about the device and trying to be too
 

00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.560
about the device and trying to be too
clever yes so what I'm doing is I'm

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:39.570
clever yes so what I'm doing is I'm
 

00:27:39.570 --> 00:27:41.300
clever yes so what I'm doing is I'm
actually playing this with the tablet in

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:41.310
actually playing this with the tablet in
 

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:43.130
actually playing this with the tablet in
the wrong orientation and the reason by

00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:43.140
the wrong orientation and the reason by
 

00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:44.300
the wrong orientation and the reason by
the way I know this isn't the correct

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:44.310
the way I know this isn't the correct
 

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:45.860
the way I know this isn't the correct
orientation of the game as I also did

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:45.870
orientation of the game as I also did
 

00:27:45.870 --> 00:27:47.360
orientation of the game as I also did
tried this on my phone and the phone it

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:47.370
tried this on my phone and the phone it
 

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:49.100
tried this on my phone and the phone it
actually worked in a much more intuitive

00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:49.110
actually worked in a much more intuitive
 

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.320
actually worked in a much more intuitive
way so this is actually one of the few

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:51.330
way so this is actually one of the few
 

00:27:51.330 --> 00:27:52.490
way so this is actually one of the few
things it doesn't really matter whether

00:27:52.490 --> 00:27:52.500
things it doesn't really matter whether
 

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.050
things it doesn't really matter whether
it's a phone or a tablet it matters what

00:27:54.050 --> 00:27:54.060
it's a phone or a tablet it matters what
 

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.180
it's a phone or a tablet it matters what
the default orientation is most phones

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:56.190
the default orientation is most phones
 

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.490
the default orientation is most phones
are default portrait most tablets are

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500
are default portrait most tablets are
 

00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.750
are default portrait most tablets are
default landscape but that's not

00:27:59.750 --> 00:27:59.760
default landscape but that's not
 

00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.880
default landscape but that's not
necessarily true so you can find some of

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:01.890
necessarily true so you can find some of
 

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:03.050
necessarily true so you can find some of
you know for instance some of the

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:03.060
you know for instance some of the
 

00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.390
you know for instance some of the
sliding keyboard phone yeah our default

00:28:05.390 --> 00:28:05.400
sliding keyboard phone yeah our default
 

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.480
sliding keyboard phone yeah our default
landscape so so that being said the game

00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:08.490
landscape so so that being said the game
 

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:10.820
landscape so so that being said the game
is really fun it's it's it's quite I

00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:10.830
is really fun it's it's it's quite I
 

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:12.680
is really fun it's it's it's quite I
really like the accelerometer control

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:12.690
really like the accelerometer control
 

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:15.380
really like the accelerometer control
and as you can see the graphic style is

00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:15.390
and as you can see the graphic style is
 

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:17.960
and as you can see the graphic style is
really really high res and sharp and it

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:17.970
really really high res and sharp and it
 

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.700
really really high res and sharp and it
looks great against this background I

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:19.710
looks great against this background I
 

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:21.470
looks great against this background I
mean this is yet another another another

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480
mean this is yet another another another
 

00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:23.240
mean this is yet another another another
you know i would say hit from the guys

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:23.250
you know i would say hit from the guys
 

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.370
you know i would say hit from the guys
over at e.on this is a no great effort

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380
over at e.on this is a no great effort
 

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.010
over at e.on this is a no great effort
here and certainly something we'd like

00:28:28.010 --> 00:28:28.020
here and certainly something we'd like
 

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.380
here and certainly something we'd like
to look at the only other thing I would

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:30.390
to look at the only other thing I would
 

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:32.390
to look at the only other thing I would
I wanted to comment on was when i

00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:32.400
I wanted to comment on was when i
 

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.580
I wanted to comment on was when i

heads up go through your titles make

00:29:40.450 --> 00:29:40.460
heads up go through your titles make
 

00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:42.850
heads up go through your titles make
sure that in every single part of the

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:42.860
sure that in every single part of the
 

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:43.990
sure that in every single part of the
game make sure the back heat does

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000
game make sure the back heat does
 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.340
game make sure the back heat does
something well even if it works in

00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:45.350
something well even if it works in
 

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:47.230
something well even if it works in
ninety percent of the cases if there's

00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240
ninety percent of the cases if there's
 

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.519
ninety percent of the cases if there's
that one percent where it doesn't work

00:29:48.519 --> 00:29:48.529
that one percent where it doesn't work
 

00:29:48.529 --> 00:29:50.799
that one percent where it doesn't work
that that's a huge deal so basically the

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:50.809

way but it also guarantees that you
 

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:06.920

game itself definitely could use some

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.160
game itself definitely could use some
 

00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:46.650

that's kind of confusing when you're

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:48.490
that's kind of confusing when you're

that's kind of confusing when you're
developing a game or any application

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:50.680
developing a game or any application

using the standard android framework for

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:52.750
using the standard android framework for
 

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:55.380
using the standard android framework for
a tablet is these devices show up as

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:55.390
a tablet is these devices show up as
 

00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:59.910
a tablet is these devices show up as
being an mdpi device and that means that

00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920
being an mdpi device and that means that
 

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.980
being an mdpi device and that means that
the default behavior is to allow the

00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:01.990
the default behavior is to allow the
 

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.140
the default behavior is to allow the
user to see a lot more information on

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:04.150
user to see a lot more information on
 

00:37:04.150 --> 00:37:05.400
user to see a lot more information on
the screen and it also

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:05.410
the screen and it also
 

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.220
the screen and it also
accurately represents the density the

00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:08.230
accurately represents the density the
 

00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:10.200
accurately represents the density the
pixel density of the device the problem

00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:10.210
pixel density of the device the problem
 

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:11.730
pixel density of the device the problem
is is it what that means in this case is

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:11.740
is is it what that means in this case is
 

00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.940
is is it what that means in this case is
it the icons are really really small you

00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:14.950
it the icons are really really small you
 

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:16.350
it the icons are really really small you
can see on that on that left and right

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:16.360
can see on that on that left and right
 

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.690
can see on that on that left and right
side they're almost unprecedented for

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:21.700
side they're almost unprecedented for
 

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.480
side they're almost unprecedented for
small so this is where it really makes

00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:24.490
small so this is where it really makes
 

00:37:24.490 --> 00:37:26.730
small so this is where it really makes
sense to actually have resources that

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:26.740
sense to actually have resources that
 

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:28.560
sense to actually have resources that
are dynamically size based upon the

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:28.570
are dynamically size based upon the
 

00:37:28.570 --> 00:37:31.620
are dynamically size based upon the
screen size rather than just based upon

00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:31.630
screen size rather than just based upon
 

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:34.320
screen size rather than just based upon
the density because this you know this

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:34.330
the density because this you know this
 

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:36.210
the density because this you know this
is just a layout that extent expanded

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.220

and there was no reason why it shouldn't
 

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:47.460
and there was no reason why it shouldn't
be on this device so guys eliminate that

00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:47.470
be on this device so guys eliminate that
 

00:38:47.470 --> 00:38:49.080

notice on tablets is that if you have a

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:50.500
notice on tablets is that if you have a
 

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:53.550
notice on tablets is that if you have a
dialogue that's full screen on a tablet

00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560
dialogue that's full screen on a tablet
 

00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:55.050
dialogue that's full screen on a tablet
like this it looks kind of ridiculous

00:38:55.050 --> 00:38:55.060
like this it looks kind of ridiculous
 

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.120
like this it looks kind of ridiculous
I'm bill is harder it's hard to see it

00:38:57.120 --> 00:38:57.130
I'm bill is harder it's hard to see it
 

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:59.490
I'm bill is harder it's hard to see it
on the screen here but this is like an

00:38:59.490 --> 00:38:59.500
on the screen here but this is like an
 

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:03.030
on the screen here but this is like an
absolute first first glance of why it

00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040
absolute first first glance of why it
 

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.980
absolute first first glance of why it
makes sense on a tablet if you have a

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:04.990
makes sense on a tablet if you have a
 

00:39:04.990 --> 00:39:06.330
makes sense on a tablet if you have a
dialogue with just three things like

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:06.340
dialogue with just three things like
 

00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:08.220
dialogue with just three things like
this to actually turn it into a dialogue

00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:08.230
this to actually turn it into a dialogue
 

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.170
this to actually turn it into a dialogue
you know just having it you know it's a

it's you know they'll make sure it never

00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:11.950
it's you know they'll make sure it never
 

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.220
it's you know they'll make sure it never
gets incredibly large like this but that

00:39:14.220 --> 00:39:14.230
gets incredibly large like this but that
 

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:15.680
gets incredibly large like this but that
being said it's certainly workable

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:15.690
being said it's certainly workable
 

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:17.329

no one's going to say don't feature it

00:39:17.329 --> 00:39:17.339
no one's going to say don't feature it
 

00:39:17.339 --> 00:39:19.069
no one's going to say don't feature it
because it has a giant dialogue like

00:39:19.069 --> 00:39:19.079
because it has a giant dialogue like
 

00:39:19.079 --> 00:39:22.130
because it has a giant dialogue like
that but it'd be nice in the game itself

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140
that but it'd be nice in the game itself
 

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.349
that but it'd be nice in the game itself
what I really really wanted was actually

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:31.910
understand what's going on is that I
think that if i upgrade my weapons to to

00:39:31.910 --> 00:39:31.920
think that if i upgrade my weapons to to
 

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.040

to an exceptional point the game is

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.050
to an exceptional point the game is
 

00:39:34.050 --> 00:39:36.020
to an exceptional point the game is
going to get more fun so this is

00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:36.030
going to get more fun so this is
 

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:37.460

00:39:47.250 --> 00:39:48.680
it there's a planet you actually it's a
little confusing the first time you play

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:48.690
little confusing the first time you play
 

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.000
little confusing the first time you play
the game that you realize you actually

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:50.010
the game that you realize you actually
 

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.010
the game that you realize you actually
have to go button and this takes you to

00:39:52.010 --> 00:39:52.020
have to go button and this takes you to
 

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.900
have to go button and this takes you to
a dialogue which then allows you to

00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:53.910
a dialogue which then allows you to
 

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.440
a dialogue which then allows you to
select a planet to fly to I would just

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:57.450
select a planet to fly to I would just
 

00:39:57.450 --> 00:39:59.930
select a planet to fly to I would just
say you know for this dialogue it would

00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940
say you know for this dialogue it would
 

00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:02.930
say you know for this dialogue it would
be nice to see that skinned yeah it's a

be nice to see that skinned yeah it's a
little skinned already but it'd be nice

00:40:04.130 --> 00:40:04.140
little skinned already but it'd be nice
 

00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.470
little skinned already but it'd be nice
it'd be nice to see it kind of more skin

00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:06.480
it'd be nice to see it kind of more skin
 

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.380
it'd be nice to see it kind of more skin
oh you're right the angle on its not to

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:09.390
oh you're right the angle on its not to
 

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:10.880
oh you're right the angle on its not to
you so you're right it is a little skin

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:10.890
you so you're right it is a little skin
 

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.280

but still there's there's a lot of the

00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:13.290
but still there's there's a lot of the
 

00:40:13.290 --> 00:40:15.740
but still there's there's a lot of the
just standard system dialogue well the

00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:15.750
just standard system dialogue well the
 

00:40:15.750 --> 00:40:16.730
just standard system dialogue well the
other thing is there's there's really no

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740
other thing is there's there's really no
 

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.079
other thing is there's there's really no
reason to me like it right why it really

00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:18.089
reason to me like it right why it really
 

00:40:18.089 --> 00:40:19.460
reason to me like it right why it really
needs to be a dialogue like I really

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:19.470
needs to be a dialogue like I really
 

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.109
needs to be a dialogue like I really
want to I really want to have like Venus

00:40:21.109 --> 00:40:21.119
want to I really want to have like Venus

something like that I think I think I

00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640
something like that I think I think I
 

00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:28.130
something like that I think I think I
think it'd be a lot easier to understand

00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140
think it'd be a lot easier to understand
 

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.630

the control scheme is pretty good it's
 

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.130
the control scheme is pretty good it's
kind of the classic control scheme for

these kind of shooter games the frame
 

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:34.819
these kind of shooter games the frame
rate could be a little bit higher and I

00:40:34.819 --> 00:40:34.829
rate could be a little bit higher and I
 

00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:35.839
rate could be a little bit higher and I
don't really you know I don't have
