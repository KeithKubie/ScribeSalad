00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's quickly review what we learned. Well first, we learned about similar triangles.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Two triangles are similar if their angles are identical

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
even though their sides don't have to be the same length.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And we've learned that these triangles have many special properties.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
One really important property is that the ratio of side lengths are the same for two similar triangles.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What this means is that if I have a right triangle with a 40-degree angle here,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I can immediately tell you the ratio of this side to that side or this one to that one.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
And that's a very powerful tool.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In fact, these ratios are so powerful that we gave names to them - sine, cosine, and tangent.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And we can remember what those names mean by SOH, CAH, TOA.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Sine is opposite over hypotenuse, cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and tangent is opposite over adjacent.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Finally, we learned that we can go back and forth between sides and angles

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
and side lengths and angles or maybe even degrees.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And this is something that we'll be doing frequently throughout the course.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Let me say good work. This is a huge accomplishment learning this much already.

00:01:07.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, let's put it to use and figure out what the circumference of the earth is.
