00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.139
Bower bird males are the kings of interior
design.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:08.559
The put a great deal of effort into creating
the perfect ‘female friendly’ space.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.389
But - these love spaces don’t always last.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.500
Bowerbird bachelors can be intensely competitive
with one another in order to secure the affections

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.500
of the ladies.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.710
After all, there’s only so much love to
go around...

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.560
There are twenty species of bowerbirds, and
these are primarily located in tropical areas

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.420
of Australia and Paupa New Guinea.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.980
Males build bowers using sticks and small
branches, and they decorate them to a potential

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.480
females’ delight!

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.580
A wide variety of environmental objects can
be used in this way, including shells, stones,

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:48.550
berries, flowers or even human-derived objects
like bright colored plastic, cutlery or glass!

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.960
Why all the show?

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.360
Bowerbirds display a reproductive system called
‘resource-based polygyny’.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.900
This means that males don’t really provide
anything to the female except for sperm.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.860
The best way for a female bowerbird to decide
whose sperm to select comes down to the beauty

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.881
of the bower, and only the most beautiful
bowers win the attention of the females.

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:14.280
In addition to carefully designing and constructing
their own bowers, males engage in something

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.110
called ‘marauding’ behavior, where they
attempt to destroy and loot the bowers of

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.220
other males.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.890
In some species, bower destruction by competing
males is a daily occurrence.

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.710
Any time a male leaves his own bower, he’s
risking the chance that another male will

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.960
come along and destroy it.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.030
And if a male destroys a fancy bower of another
male, it’s a double win for him (since his

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.500
competition’s love nest is destroyed AND
he can take the decorations for use on his

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.780
own love nest.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.259
All’s fair in love and war!

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.390
Actual mating takes place when a female approves
the males’ bower.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.979
She comes to mate with the male in his cushy
pad, but she doesn’t stay.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.259
Once she’s received her sperm selection,
she will build her own nest in which she will

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.509
lay her eggs and take care of her chicks when
they hatch.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.730
She will be a single parent from here on out,
as the boys continue on their own quests for

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:10.739
the most beautiful and enticing space for
the ‘next good thing’.

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.290
