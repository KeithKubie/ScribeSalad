everybody who does basic science would

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
everybody who does basic science would
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670
everybody who does basic science would
dream of you know doing something and

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680
dream of you know doing something and
 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.179
dream of you know doing something and
really having at work out to help people

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189
really having at work out to help people
 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.850

was always when I was doing science

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
was always when I was doing science
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.730

was doing you know we've got to figure

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
was doing you know we've got to figure
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.539
was doing you know we've got to figure
this out you know but then it at one

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549
this out you know but then it at one
 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.310
this out you know but then it at one
point you know every now and then I

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320
point you know every now and then I
 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.120
point you know every now and then I
would say okay what do we know now what

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130
would say okay what do we know now what
 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.770
would say okay what do we know now what
how could we use this inside sort of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
how could we use this inside sort of
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.530
how could we use this inside sort of
work then try to jump you know and say

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540
work then try to jump you know and say
 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.270
work then try to jump you know and say
okay can we use this to treat cancer you

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280
okay can we use this to treat cancer you
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.670

people a volunteer to be in clinical
 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.650
people a volunteer to be in clinical
trials so we can keep the work going and

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660
trials so we can keep the work going and
 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.120
