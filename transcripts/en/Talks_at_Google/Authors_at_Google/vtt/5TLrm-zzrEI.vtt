00:00:07.105 --> 00:00:08.480
MALE SPEAKER:
Well, good morning.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.640
Welcome to Authors at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.190
Today it's my great pleasure to
introduce Andrea Coville, who

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.480
is CEO of Brodeur Partners
here in Boston with offices--

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.550
nationwide, worldwide?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.370
Excellent.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.430
As CEO--

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.310
MALE SPEAKER: As CEO, she has
diversified Brodeur Partners

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.230
from a PR firm
specializing in technology

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.610
to a multi-disciplinary
communications agency focusing

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.720
on full service communications,
digital strategy,

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.730
social change, and
business consulting.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.870
Her passions include
social issues

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.930
that advance the
wellbeing of children.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.040
Today, she's here to discuss
her recent book, "Relevance:

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.390
The Power to Change
Minds and Behavior

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.460
and Stay Ahead of
the Competition."

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.390
I've read this book.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.640
It is definitely, in my
opinion, a cut above all

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.490
the other business books.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.620
It has a lot to say on topics
that are much more, pardon

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.150
the phrase, relevant
than one might think.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.670
She points out that
organizations spend billions

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.740
of dollars annually
in an attempt

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.030
to win customers, move products,
and enhance their brand image.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.550
However, many of
these efforts are

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.810
missing an essential
element-- relevance.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.960
Miss Coville draws on original
research and two decades

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.745
of experience to
offer organizations

00:01:36.745 --> 00:01:41.070
a road-tested plan for creating
highly relevant messages

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.220
to shift attitudes and, most
importantly, consumer behavior.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.678
Please join me in
welcoming Andrea Brodeur.

00:01:48.678 --> 00:01:52.066
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.920
ANDREA COVILLE: Thank you
so much for spending then

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.940
the next hour or so with me.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.240
I'd love to just to ask you a
little bit about yourselves.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.430
Anybody here from marketing?

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.250
Product development?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.740
Maybe you could tell me.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.670
Could you tell me
some of what you do?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.578
AUDIENCE: I'm just an
engineering intern.

00:02:17.578 --> 00:02:19.970
And I was excited
to hear your talk.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.149
ANDREA COVILLE: Neat.

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.940
How about yourself?

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.380
AUDIENCE: I'm in SRE, so
it's also in engineering,

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.284
although I've done
politics and music.

00:02:28.284 --> 00:02:30.236
ANDREA COVILLE: Awesome.

00:02:30.236 --> 00:02:33.164
AUDIENCE: I'm an engineer.

00:02:33.164 --> 00:02:36.060
AUDIENCE: I'm an engineer
working with partners,

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.960
supporting our partners
in the travel business.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.520
ANDREA COVILLE:
Really interesting.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.530
I know that you are in
the literary business.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.850
AUDIENCE: Oh, but before
that, I worked here

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.710
and did systems development.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.519
ANDREA COVILLE: Oh, cool.

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:51.310
How about yourself?

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.476
AUDIENCE: I'm in the global
sales organization here.

00:02:53.476 --> 00:02:56.820
So it's very topical for
us to talk about relevance

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.292
with our clients getting
lots of different messages

00:02:59.292 --> 00:03:03.976
and lots of different messages
from us, since we do so much.

00:03:03.976 --> 00:03:05.930
AUDIENCE: I'm also
in global sales

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.930
and working with
companies often times

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.430
to help create a brand
using [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.720
ANDREA COVILLE: Great.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.220
Molly?

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.010
AUDIENCE: I'm an
intern at [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.570
AUDIENCE: I'm an an
engineering intern

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.250
who's just really interested
in what you have to say.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.210
ANDREA COVILLE: Thanks.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.150
AUDIENCE: Engineer in travel.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:25.070
ANDREA COVILLE: Great.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:28.460
Well, it is such a pleasure
to meet all of you.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.360
My name is Andy.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.230
Thank you for the very
nice introduction.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.850
And as my background has--
I started out as a writer,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.560
got really interested by
the importance of words,

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.550
and then moved into marketing
and actually public relations,

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.370
which led me into the
world of communications.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.970
And I think about six years ago
I had this fundamental decision

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.220
that I wanted to
make, which was how

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.500
to create more meaning in an
industry that, at times, I felt

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.720
could be a tad superficial.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.220
And as you all are in
the world of engineering

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.540
and the importance of
data and analytics,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.530
in my business
and communications

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.220
is that business started
shifting to really emphasizing

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.580
the importance of that.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.170
I found out that--
there's someone's phone.

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.040
Probably just
knock it off, yeah.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.242
I found that there was less
importance being placed--

00:04:22.242 --> 00:04:23.950
do you mind just
turning that off, Molly?

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.240
Thank you.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.590
It's my phone, so I
can't blame her for that.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.550
The lack of importance of
putting the insight piece

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.260
into the funnel was
something I really

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.070
wanted to spend some time on.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.120
And that was the
original hypothesis

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.971
when I began working
on the book was--

00:04:42.971 --> 00:04:45.470
there was a sort of thinking
that communications could truly

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:46.760
change behavior.

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.710
But could we really push that?

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:49.400
Can you think?

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.140
Can communications
truly change behavior,

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.220
or is it something that can
support behavioral change?

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.780
And the word "relevance"
really appealed to me,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.740
because it's an old word.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.040
It's like resilience.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:04.140
It's an old word that has, I
felt, very powerful meaning.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.620
It's a word that
sometimes advertisers

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.870
would use as an index,
essentially, or as a metric.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.160
But to me, relevance as a
word has social and practical

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.792
applicability.

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:20.190
And we have choices, right?

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:23.910
We're in a world that
there's a real duality,

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.570
I think, in our
environment today.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.570
We have the ability to
select, yet we are saturated.

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.060
We have so much
information coming at us.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.560
Why do we choose the things
we choose to engage in?

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.200
Why do we choose them,
with so many options?

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.830
And beyond that, why do we
actually stay engaged in them?

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.710
I always love thinking
about communications

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.560
in terms of-- have you ever
had a friend that did something

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.240
you truly didn't expect
that friend to do?

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.710
Say that friend never went
outside their comfort zone.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.310
They had a life of ritual.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.790
But that friend, all of a
sudden, went to a lecture,

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:03.490
maybe once on Haiti,
and decided-- never

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.830
traveled before-- decided
to actually jump on a plane,

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.480
go to an orphanage, help
out, help out almost

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.610
like in a camping
trip environment,

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.490
and came back a completely--
not changed person,

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.670
but really a broadened person.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.120
I'm always fascinated
by the insight that

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.990
comes from a person, an
idea, a company, a brand that

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.100
can open up people emotionally
and get them to connect.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.710
So enter the relevant brand.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:38.350
And what my research
focused on was

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.912
trying to look at some of the
drivers of behavioral change.

00:06:41.912 --> 00:06:45.170
Are there are emotional
triggers that we can identify?

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.830
And are there maps,
connection points?

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.780
And again, my business
is I'm an agency girl.

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.520
I've grown up in agencies
and communication.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.384
So I take this from a
communications perspective.

00:06:56.384 --> 00:06:57.800
I'm not a behavioral
psychologist.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.230
I'm a communications person.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.790
Our research started by asking
people to self-identify.

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.610
And we looked at the
cohorts on the right--

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:09.890
the baby boomers, the Gen
X'ers, the Millennials.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:14.250
And I don't use those terms,
those cohorts, very often.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:16.490
But sometimes, in terms
of research like this,

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:18.530
it just makes it easier.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.750
We asked people to
self-identify by age.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.135
And you think about things
like risk taking and ambition.

00:07:25.135 --> 00:07:26.010
And that makes sense.

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.510
The younger you are, the middle
part you are in your career,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.950
somewhere to 30 to 54, you're
going to be more risky.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.180
Probably is true with your
stock investments as well.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:37.290
It's interesting to see
how optimism changes.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.287
You tend to-- from
our research, this

00:07:39.287 --> 00:07:41.120
is six months old--
tend to be a little more

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.350
optimistic before you turn 55.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.090
But the one thing that united
every age group that people

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:52.010
self-identified with, when
chosen, was compassion.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.730
So when you're
thinking about a brand

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.040
and you're thinking about
you reaching an individual,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.040
yes, you might be
reaching an engineer.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.810
You might be reaching a doctor.

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:03.760
You might be reaching
a small business owner.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.280
But you are reaching
a human being

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.850
that, in most
circumstances, truly

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:12.450
values that compassion is
really relevant to them.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:16.260
So once you think about the fact
of how people self-identify,

00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:20.040
you ask people what is
relevant to them personally.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.330
And this is a-- if
we were on a webinar,

00:08:22.330 --> 00:08:25.640
I'd have you vote by
clicking a button.

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.530
Which of these
things in our survey

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.160
was the most important
of these six?

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:36.524
What do you think came out
as top across all age groups?

00:08:36.524 --> 00:08:38.020
AUDIENCE: To make friends?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.960
ANDREA COVILLE: You
nailed it, absolutely.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.419
So the next slide you'll
see important and relevant

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:46.390
to you personally being
understood collectively

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:49.520
is probably the least
important to all of us.

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.150
Making a difference starts
getting really important.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:53.970
Staying healthy, of course.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.300
But personally,
what we care about

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:58.940
is that our friends and
family, in caring for them--

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.900
not just caring for them
in a healthcare sense,

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.050
but caring for
them emotionally--

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.690
is very, very important.

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.350
And as you all know, you've seen
the research, the only people

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.300
that truly care where
financial security moves up

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:14.680
the list to maybe
the top almost eighth

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.300
is the wealthiest people care
about being financially secure.

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:21.190
So if you make
$170,000 or more, you

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.570
tend to put the staying
healthy and financially secure

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:26.350
kind of go hand in hand.

00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:31.042
But so what we did
was the research,

00:09:31.042 --> 00:09:33.125
and I'm going to get into
a little bit more of it.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:35.291
And I want to show you some
fresh research I've only

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.000
showed one other group before.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.710
Most companies and
organizations really

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.880
focus on the upper right
hand side, the thinking side.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.730
Which makes a lot of
sense-- it's the rational,

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.515
it's the functional
piece of information.

00:09:47.515 --> 00:09:48.895
It helps make my needs.

00:09:48.895 --> 00:09:52.180
It helps my life,
makes my life easier.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:54.930
I mean, if you just think about,
as engineers, probably the way

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:56.470
you receive a lot
of information,

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.950
it's probably very data driven.

00:09:58.950 --> 00:10:01.740
Certainly, with
physicians or surgeons,

00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.081
you're talking about outcomes
it's very, very specific.

00:10:05.081 --> 00:10:06.955
We started looking at
how our data clustered.

00:10:06.955 --> 00:10:09.750
And it clustered into
three other areas.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:11.826
Values, we started
seeing people,

00:10:11.826 --> 00:10:13.200
especially if you
look at the way

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:16.080
a human being engages
with a nonprofit,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.910
that's where your
values as a human being

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.307
connect to the organization.

00:10:20.307 --> 00:10:22.390
And you're going to see
some data we have actually

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.370
on your brand, Google, the
values are a very, very

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.340
important part of
your external brand.

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:29.070
The social.

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:30.760
I don't mean social media here.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.520
I mean the social networks
that we all bring,

00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:39.310
whether it's our bike club, our
book club, who we travel with,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.680
if we have children.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:43.450
The PTA systems are
our children's friends.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.850
It's the networks we
bring to our environments.

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:49.010
And sensory, this
is the piece that

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:52.040
has been done-- I think-- has
the most incredible potential

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.720
in terms of communications.

00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:59.220
I mean, I like to use this
example as a category changer,

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:02.346
because what they did-- if
you remember way early on--

00:11:02.346 --> 00:11:04.470
and your company is certainly
doing a ton of this--

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:08.020
is they brought a sixth
sensory experience to a very,

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.690
I would say, static technology.

00:11:10.690 --> 00:11:13.710
And there are tons
and tons of companies

00:11:13.710 --> 00:11:15.610
out there, from medical
device companies

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:19.180
to pharmaceutical companies
to consumer companies that

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:22.070
have an incredible
opportunity to explore

00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:25.300
the sensory element of engaging
with people emotionally.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:28.840
And I think there's a
tremendous amount of research.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.770
So some of the metrics
we use in our research

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:34.780
and that correlates to the
quadrants are the following.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:38.010
So we look for
things like values.

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.750
Does it stand for
the same things

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:42.650
human you do as a human being?

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:44.080
If you're associated
with a brand,

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.450
how do you feel about yourself?

00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:48.640
If you're a runner and you
choose Camel water packs,

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.980
and they're a certain size
and they fit when you run,

00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:53.420
what does that say about you?

00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.220
It helps me meet my needs.

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:56.560
Makes my life easier.

00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:58.810
There's that functional aspect.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.900
It's not for everyone, but
it's for people like me,

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.397
and it inspires me.

00:12:03.397 --> 00:12:05.230
And remembering at the
center of all of this

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.840
are individuals that care
about their family and friends

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:10.260
and are compassionate.

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.530
So there's different
relevance engagement pathways

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.570
for different types
of products, we found.

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.640
Personal products, it
makes a lot of sense,

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.380
and personal products
would be a smartphone

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.210
or could even be a RAZR.

00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:28.450
But you associate it with the
values that are important.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:31.210
But most of all, it
really meets your needs.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:33.130
There's a functional
aspect to it.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:38.110
High end products like
cars, luxury goods,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.550
or not necessarily luxury cars,
but maybe that's a choice.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:47.550
Whether you're a Zipcar consumer
or you buy your own car,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.030
part of it is something
about wanting people

00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:51.750
to know that you're
associated with it

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.610
and it meets your needs.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:57.805
Professional services,
very, very all

00:12:57.805 --> 00:12:59.430
about making your
life easier, thinking

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.690
about your relationship
with your accountant.

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.660
Again, these are where the
drivers of relevance burst.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.740
But the opportunity
is to look where

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:11.085
the shorter drivers of
relevance are, and is there

00:13:11.085 --> 00:13:12.860
an opportunity to explore those?

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.910
And certainly with
charitable organizations,

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:17.300
you can see that the
charitable organizations are

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.410
very values-based in terms of
their branding communications.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:24.200
But the data we
just did-- and I'll

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:27.320
show you this in a minute-- that
the functional side, people are

00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.820
caring more and more about
the return on their donation.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:35.240
Even if it's $10, they want
to know it goes somewhere.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.450
So here's some
interesting data, when

00:13:37.450 --> 00:13:39.450
you start thinking
for our perspective,

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:42.320
about category loyalty.

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.194
All problems in the world can
be solved if you bring people

00:13:45.194 --> 00:13:46.360
together for food and drink.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.193
I guess that's sort of
the number one thing.

00:13:48.193 --> 00:13:52.410
Everybody thinks and is
loyal to food and drink

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.430
brands, number one
category loyalty.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.620
News and information
comes second.

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.700
And way down at the
end is automobiles.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.550
And with the exception
of consumer electronics,

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.880
it's pretty evenly
skewed, brand loyalty

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.720
between men and
women of all ages.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:14.200
Then you look at category
level against age,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.090
against different demographics.

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.250
And what's interesting to me
is that news and information

00:14:20.250 --> 00:14:27.670
sources from the 18 to
24 cohort and the 65 plus

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:30.150
have a lot in common.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:36.209
And certainly, I would say the
Gen X'ers, the Gen Y'ers, food

00:14:36.209 --> 00:14:37.250
and drink are really key.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:39.670
But it's interesting to see
the media consumption so

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:45.310
important at both ends
of the age axis here.

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.990
If you look at this
across ethnicities

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:51.610
you can see the ranking order
of category loyalty going

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:54.230
from left to right
were food and drink

00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.520
is the most across
all ethnicities,

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:02.470
going down to automobiles,
which is the least category

00:15:02.470 --> 00:15:04.980
loyalty-- although
Caucasians have the highest

00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:09.250
loyalty to automobiles,
and African Americans

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.670
skew the highest in terms of
news and information sources.

00:15:12.670 --> 00:15:13.472
Yes?

00:15:13.472 --> 00:15:14.930
AUDIENCE: Would
you mind explaining

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:21.410
what brand or category loyalty
means exactly here for food

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.194
and drink on [INAUDIBLE]?

00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:24.610
ANDREA COVILLE:
It means that they

00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.480
have those questions
that I showed you

00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.880
a couple slides about.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.850
They have answered
those questions,

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:34.560
and they've also indicated
that they will stay.

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.550
They care most.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:38.900
We asked them, out of
all of these categories,

00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:41.260
what you care most
about, and what do you

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:45.000
change your preferences
about least?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.750
So you don't switch, like
your favorite restaurants,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:49.120
your favorite beers.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.025
You stay loyal to them
over a period of time.

00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.040
So again, here's here a
little bit more about this.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.280
Among the
organizations, if you're

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.760
looking at relevance
profiles of organizations,

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:05.010
we asked people again
in our research,

00:16:05.010 --> 00:16:07.980
what organizations
most share your values?

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.170
And this is where
Google comes up.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.250
Is at the most interesting
and exciting out of people

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.430
we put or companies we
put in your category?

00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:18.370
Who would you miss
most if you were gone,

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.700
and who would you like
to do business with?

00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:23.440
So this is six months of data.

00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:26.630
And you can see that-- I don't
think it would surprise you--

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.940
that Microsoft has a lot
of this from for decades

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:39.250
a sort of embedded brand
relevance in corporations.

00:16:39.250 --> 00:16:44.500
Apple, certainly through
its-- in the Steven Jobs era--

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.050
really, really created this.

00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.020
People thought of them
as the most interesting.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.660
But what was so interesting to
us about the Google responses

00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:57.270
were that people would
miss you the most.

00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.200
And I think it's just if
it's people haven't even

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.010
experienced any other product
other than just search, if you

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.970
ask people, if you took the
ability to do Google search out

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.600
of your daily life, what
would your life be like?

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.349
You people would say,
I couldn't stand it.

00:17:11.349 --> 00:17:13.720
We would completely miss it.

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.180
And even if that's
the only entry

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:17.960
point they have into your brand,
the other interesting thing

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:25.230
about this was the values
piece, the values the company

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:27.200
I see my own personal
values in the way

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:29.730
the company behaves and brands.

00:17:29.730 --> 00:17:33.260
And that was very, very
strong for Google as well.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:36.330
So we're looking
at another, we're

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:38.110
looking at now
brand ambassadors.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.210
And those are people
who go out of their way

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.970
to create a positive impression
of your brand with others.

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.590
These are male and female.

00:17:46.590 --> 00:17:51.340
And it's interesting, with
the exception of Intel and HP,

00:17:51.340 --> 00:17:53.250
most of the brand
ambassadors skew female.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.320
If you look at
income, you can see

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.120
that what I found
interesting here

00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:04.020
is some of the best brand
ambassadors actually make

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.660
the least amount of money
in terms of brand investors.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.235
So they go out of their way
to communicate their brand

00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:11.735
preferences.

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:15.780
Yeah?

00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:19.280
AUDIENCE: How do you
identify brand ambassadors?

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.280
ANDREA COVILLE: Brand--?

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:23.140
AUDIENCE: Yeah, ambassadors.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:26.070
ANDREA COVILLE: They
commit to word of mouth.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:28.990
They will commit to a
word of mouth action

00:18:28.990 --> 00:18:32.980
on behalf of a brand and
behaviors that show they share

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.810
and endorse the brand-- like,
for example, communicating

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.150
about the experience on
their social media networks

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:40.110
throughout their communities.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:40.610
Right.

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:43.068
AUDIENCE: It's the difference
between like a brand and then

00:18:43.068 --> 00:18:44.751
liking it so much
that you want to talk

00:18:44.751 --> 00:18:45.792
to other people about it.

00:18:45.792 --> 00:18:47.790
ANDREA COVILLE: Exactly.

00:18:47.790 --> 00:18:50.050
So this looks at
it, and it never

00:18:50.050 --> 00:18:53.710
underestimates those group of
people, whether they're younger

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:55.740
or they make the least
amount of money that

00:18:55.740 --> 00:18:58.290
are using your product.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:01.280
They'll be making more
money probably before long.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.860
And they're very, very, very
powerful brand ambassadors

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.050
for your brand in the
next 10 to 20 years.

00:19:08.050 --> 00:19:12.730
Then we looked at-- this is sort
of interesting-- organization

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:13.230
relevance.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.180
If you look at the
communities people

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.480
belong to outside of work,
are they particularly

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.490
loyal to any kinds of
civic organizations,

00:19:23.490 --> 00:19:27.430
or they have a
religious affiliation,

00:19:27.430 --> 00:19:29.720
or they think government
is doing a good job.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.440
And I guess it's pretty
clear that BlackBerry brand

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:36.930
ambassadors feel that
government is doing a good job.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:38.800
And Microsoft has
a lot of people

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.450
that belong to a
civic organization.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:42.715
It's just interesting
to see where they work

00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:45.820
and where they play, or what
they think about outside.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:48.370
Now, you can apply this
to any market segment.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.480
And I'm going to show you in
a minute some very fresh data

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.230
around law firms and banking
institutions and higher

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:55.350
education.

00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:57.940
But in retail stores,
when we did this survey

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.860
and then we redid it within
a 24-month period of time,

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.190
Target has not changed.

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:07.060
And you would have thought that
Target would have been impacted

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:11.350
by the security breaches
in a really negative way.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:14.780
But I think Target was
so relevant to people

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:17.480
on so many levels, I mean
it's fun to go in there.

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.810
It's a sensory experience.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:22.240
It's easy to find
and grab some food.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:24.190
You can get good bargains.

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:25.530
It's fun.

00:20:25.530 --> 00:20:28.610
They have a lot of goodwill
that has been associated

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.500
with that at a retail level I
think that has really carried

00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.250
over and carried
them through this.

00:20:33.250 --> 00:20:35.670
And people aren't willing to
give up that experience, even

00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.260
for some of the
security breaches.

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.400
Our next film cut of
data is looking at,

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:44.030
can you look at
drivers of relevance

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.377
and look at increases
in market cap over time?

00:20:47.377 --> 00:20:48.460
Does it make a difference?

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.150
That's our next [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.850
And it'll be interesting to
look at Target and Walmart

00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:56.520
two years now and see if there
are financial analytics that

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.940
correspond to
drivers of wellness.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:00.750
Now, were talking
about Comcast earlier

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:02.070
before the talk started.

00:21:02.070 --> 00:21:04.766
And I would say that
telecommunications

00:21:04.766 --> 00:21:07.140
is a pretty tough industry
to differentiate in.

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:10.440
If you're head of marketing for
a telecommunications industry,

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.190
it's challenging.

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.060
But clearly,
Verizon-- whether it's

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.935
through some of their
corporate partnerships,

00:21:15.935 --> 00:21:17.476
whether it's through
the product line

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.920
that they offer, whether it's
through their storefronts,

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.300
their retail operations.

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.270
They have significantly
more drivers

00:21:24.270 --> 00:21:26.730
of relevance than
the competition.

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:30.190
Beverage companies,
another look at relevance.

00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:32.150
Again, this is a
blend of all cohorts,

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:34.108
because if you were just
looking at Millenials,

00:21:34.108 --> 00:21:38.180
you'd probably see Red Bull
be completely off the page.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.015
But what's interesting
about Red Bull

00:21:41.015 --> 00:21:42.660
is the most interesting driver.

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:45.720
Certainly if you look at
some of the ways they engage

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.920
their target audience,
they do really

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.860
fun, colorful, extreme events.

00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:53.990
People very clearly
associate them

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:56.720
with being one of most
interesting compound companies.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.560
And Coca Cola, if
you're thinking

00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.260
about an industry which
is flavored water-- right?

00:22:01.260 --> 00:22:03.750
I mean, with all of the
secret formula, of course.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.410
Coca Cola has done a good
job, a very good job,

00:22:07.410 --> 00:22:11.160
across decades of maintaining
its brand leadership.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.660
So you can start digging into
and using all those metrics

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:17.580
that I showed you a few
screens ago-- men and women,

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.200
ethnicities,
income-- and you can

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.350
start asking lots of questions.

00:22:23.350 --> 00:22:25.080
I mean, talk about a
sensory experience.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.380
Probably drinking
a beverage is one

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:29.350
of the most sensory
experiences you'll have.

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:34.280
And you saw the data that showed
that category loyalty to food

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.370
and beverages are
extremely high.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:38.680
It's number one among
all respondents.

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.770
People stay loyal to Coke.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:43.570
You can look at nonprofits.

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:46.720
I love this story about the
American Cancer Society,

00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.880
because if you think of
all of the nonprofits,

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.840
they're dealing with a
pretty tough subject.

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:53.250
They're dealing with cancer.

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:57.060
So how do you make the
number one killer of people

00:22:57.060 --> 00:23:01.230
in their mid middle years
or even younger years,

00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:05.980
how do you engage people, other
than out of fear or sadness,

00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:07.970
because they've been
a survivor or they

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.190
have a family member
that's experienced cancer?

00:23:10.190 --> 00:23:14.040
Well, they've done a
particularly great job

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.110
about getting people into
the business of celebrating

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:25.230
birthdays, and getting people to
fight cancer by donating funds

00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:28.190
or by walking a relay
race or doing something

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.940
positive to celebrate someone's
birthday that they love--

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:33.670
whether they're here as
themselves, someone who's

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.590
no longer here, or
it's a family member.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:37.880
So it's taking a very,
very tough subject

00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.130
and making it very
relevant to people

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.680
to do something about
in a positive way.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:45.050
So they do a great job at that.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:46.970
So this is some of
the new research

00:23:46.970 --> 00:23:48.510
that I wanted to show you.

00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:52.390
We asked people-- this is
probably two weeks old--

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:56.740
why people, why they're
loyal to brands, charities,

00:23:56.740 --> 00:23:58.400
and political causes?

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.470
So again, we went back to
the questions about values.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.230
Does the cause
stand for something

00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:05.940
that's important to me?

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:06.830
Is it social?

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.510
Does it make me feel
good to support it?

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:10.470
Is it functional?

00:24:10.470 --> 00:24:11.810
Does it meet needs?

00:24:11.810 --> 00:24:14.930
And sensory-- it's
not for everyone,

00:24:14.930 --> 00:24:16.060
but it's special for me.

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:18.700
There's something about
my emotional makeup

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:20.290
that makes me connect to it.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:23.090
And it inspires me.

00:24:23.090 --> 00:24:26.340
So the data, the new
data, shows that when

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.840
a product or service--
and you think

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.381
about that data I
showed you earlier,

00:24:29.381 --> 00:24:32.220
which were high end products
or lower end products,

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.640
personal products--
function was very important

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:40.410
in that first
classification of data.

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:45.650
But now the sensory and emotive
piece starts to take over.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:48.890
So people are starting to
say for the first time,

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:51.110
it makes me feel
good to support it.

00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:53.800
So if you're an engineer and
you're developing a consumer

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.070
product, it's really
interesting to think

00:24:56.070 --> 00:24:58.960
not only on the functional
aspects of that product,

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.066
but wow.

00:25:00.066 --> 00:25:02.190
Can you imagine the person
that you're designing it

00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:05.070
for is actually going to say,
I connect to that personally.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.220
I feel really good
about supporting it.

00:25:07.220 --> 00:25:10.080
And using it inspires me.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.670
The next is the data that
came out about charities.

00:25:12.670 --> 00:25:16.050
And I preempted myself
by saying definitely it's

00:25:16.050 --> 00:25:18.200
all about my personal values.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:20.600
But there has to be a
functional side to it.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.950
And you see this with a lot
of community foundations,

00:25:23.950 --> 00:25:25.610
foundations all over the world.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:27.730
I mean, they're helping
a lot of people.

00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:31.020
But people are starting to
look at new kind of generations

00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:31.680
of foundations.

00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:36.600
How are we actually creating
sustainable practices

00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.560
with the people that
we were giving to

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:43.870
so that great work keeps
propagating itself?

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:46.240
Really interesting, this
sort of explains to me

00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:48.720
the state of
affairs on politics.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.400
But people, what's really
important to people

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.960
is when they vote for a
candidate is they like them.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.070
When it gets down to the
functional side, when

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:02.951
you start talking about,
what's their track record?

00:26:02.951 --> 00:26:04.950
You really start looking
into their backgrounds,

00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.616
you'd think a lot of
people would really

00:26:06.616 --> 00:26:09.140
concentrate on the
functional aspects.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.110
The data is showing people
look at candidates and say,

00:26:13.110 --> 00:26:13.820
I like them.

00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.130
I like the way
they-- I mean, they

00:26:17.130 --> 00:26:21.260
seem to stand for
the same things I do.

00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.990
I associate it with values
that are important to me.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.140
It's very, very
values, ethics driven.

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:31.410
And you can see why the
divides exist amongst parties,

00:26:31.410 --> 00:26:33.950
because there are so many
different slices of values

00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:36.260
and ethics in our nation.

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:38.980
So if you take a look
at collapsing the three

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:43.340
elements on this slide, you can
see that different sectors have

00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.810
different balances,
different quadrant balances,

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:46.930
of relevance.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:48.530
But there's such an opportunity.

00:26:48.530 --> 00:26:50.800
And their balanced
for a good reason.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:55.600
So my argument is,
I'm not suggesting

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.330
make all quadrants equal.

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.930
I'm not suggesting don't
lead where your strength is.

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:01.620
But what I'm
suggesting, there are

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:05.750
insights that you can find from
the other three quadrants that

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.600
can add a tremendous
emotional dimension

00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:14.830
to the creative product that
you're putting out there

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:15.880
for people.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.650
And I think we're
beginning to see

00:27:17.650 --> 00:27:21.670
that the analytics and the
data do support creating

00:27:21.670 --> 00:27:24.110
an insight that is
tremendously unique

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.660
and that's derived from a
very holistic look at a person

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.590
rather than just a
functional look at a person.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:32.870
So here's some fresh new data.

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:34.000
It's a law firm.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.090
You're thinking
about a law firm.

00:27:37.090 --> 00:27:40.540
You're in the room
with your parents.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.954
You both are thinking,
well, the firm I choose

00:27:42.954 --> 00:27:44.870
will be the one with the
most successful track

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:46.245
record with the
greatest clients,

00:27:46.245 --> 00:27:49.440
the greatest number
of cases won.

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.750
Is it a firm that I know?

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.280
Is it one I can
personally trust?

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.550
The firm, is it a social?

00:27:54.550 --> 00:27:56.780
So for example, does it
have a really good track

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.740
record with social causes?

00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:01.760
Is it recommended by a friend
or a family member or someone

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.730
in my business?

00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:09.290
Or is finding a relationship
inside a firm with someone

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.030
that's really
committed to helping

00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:14.550
me have a successful
outcome, that emotion?

00:28:14.550 --> 00:28:17.490
Sort of falls more in
the sensory bucket.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:23.240
And it's really interesting to
say that the whole red quadrant

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.530
lower right is the
firm I choose will

00:28:25.530 --> 00:28:27.530
be the one I can
personally trust.

00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:30.550
37% that was important to.

00:28:30.550 --> 00:28:36.800
27% was the firm that was--
and this is collectively--

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:39.320
was the firm that helped
the individual achieve

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.110
a successful outcome.

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:43.560
The firm I choose will
be the one recommended

00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.630
by another person, and then
finally the track record.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:50.220
But it's interesting,
the youngest people

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:54.470
in our survey cared about
the track record the most.

00:28:54.470 --> 00:29:01.730
And the older people, especially
in the 55 to 64-year-old range,

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:05.030
really care about the
commitment to the outcome.

00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:08.640
So the lesson for us as
branders and marketers

00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.150
is relevance changes.

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:12.850
Relevance changes.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:14.340
It's circumstantial.

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:18.750
It changes with
how your life goes.

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:21.450
And it changes with
different situations.

00:29:21.450 --> 00:29:22.990
It's very situational.

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:26.640
But the things-- and you'll
see also in banking--

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.260
that there's a trend to, in
the early parts of our lives,

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.835
we're thinking about maximizing
returns all the time.

00:29:33.835 --> 00:29:35.960
Our data started to show
that people would actually

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:40.436
forego $1 of profit for a
long-standing relationship

00:29:40.436 --> 00:29:41.810
with a financial
institution that

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:43.920
cared about you
across your lifetime.

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.830
So again, we asked them the
same sorts of questions.

00:29:46.830 --> 00:29:49.720
I just gave you a
sneak peek into this.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:53.240
The two leading
quadrants were one

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:58.120
about firms I know are used
by people I trust and respect.

00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.000
So word of mouth,
very, very important

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.610
in financial services.

00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:03.610
And the second one
was saving money.

00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.840
The digital ease of use
was the smallest slice,

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.550
but most important, you'll
see, to the youngest audience.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.430
And then this, the red part,
became very, very important

00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:19.340
to people as they age.

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:23.450
So you can see how the
data kind of-- this chart

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:26.720
explains what I just said.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:30.150
So I don't know if any
of you in this room

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.490
are still paying
off college loans.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.410
I know I'm a parent.

00:30:33.410 --> 00:30:36.180
I have three boys in college.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.090
I was really fascinated with
the results of this survey.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.700
So if you're thinking
about choosing a college--

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:46.870
and we looked, again, same
age spectrum-- what do you

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:47.710
care about?

00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:50.040
Do you care about a
learning experience

00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.610
that can help you
prepare for a career?

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.720
Do you care about a
learning experience

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.060
that socially connects
you to other people?

00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.210
Is it your network you
get when you graduate?

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:05.590
Is it about an experience that
changes or shapes your values?

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.990
Or is it about
just something that

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:11.180
creates an overall
positive experience?

00:31:11.180 --> 00:31:15.810
Well, unequivocally,
getting a job,

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.080
having an experience that
leads to a successful outcome

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.820
where you are employed
is incredibly important.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:24.420
It's incredibly
important to people

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:26.220
who are in college,
who have recently

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.590
graduated from college,
or who are currently

00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:31.210
paying for their
kids' college, or who

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:32.820
are paying off their loans.

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:37.700
So again, looking
at 10 years ago,

00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:39.874
I think this would have
been very, very different.

00:31:39.874 --> 00:31:42.040
I think the social networks,
if we'd have done this,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.320
would have been very, very
important-- who you know,

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.560
who you meet.

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.140
Those are the tickets to
getting you a job later in life.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:50.790
So again, this is the breakdown.

00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:54.400
This shows how a college
university or learning

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.650
experience can prepare
you for a career.

00:31:56.650 --> 00:32:01.046
Clearly, the leading indicator
across all age cohorts.

00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:02.680
Very interesting.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.100
So I've told you,
this is survey work.

00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:07.500
So this is a lot of
marketing survey work.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.180
There are also
pieces of relevance

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.760
that you can get which I just
call that are circumstantially.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:15.090
And we look across one
of the tools we have,

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:17.400
it's a software product
that recognizing

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.050
keywords or phrases.

00:32:19.050 --> 00:32:22.540
So we can look across
the social platforms.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:24.630
And for example,
if we're looking

00:32:24.630 --> 00:32:27.610
for a luxury good
hotel, we can see

00:32:27.610 --> 00:32:30.410
how people, words,
or phrases that

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:33.011
are used in conversation or
dialogue that are associated

00:32:33.011 --> 00:32:35.510
with Hilton, that are associated
with the Four Seasons, that

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.670
might be associated
with the Ritz Carlton.

00:32:37.670 --> 00:32:43.050
And I use this example
because it's, we found,

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.670
a very, very
interesting insight.

00:32:44.670 --> 00:32:46.900
We were looking at
luxury categories.

00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:49.160
We had done our qualitative
and quantitative research.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.290
We'd done all the
relevance profiles.

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.430
We saw this comment that
just kept cropping up

00:32:54.430 --> 00:32:56.710
about Ritz Carlton hotels.

00:32:56.710 --> 00:32:59.490
And the online dialogue,
the words and phrases

00:32:59.490 --> 00:33:03.480
were all talking about the
water temperature and pressure

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.830
of Ritz Carlton hotels.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:07.210
And they said, if you
are a business traveler,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.260
you have got to stay
at a Ritz Carlton.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:12.720
There's no better shower in
the world if you're traveling.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.140
It's the temperature,
it's the pressure.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.010
It's better than the coffee
or the great-smelling lobby,

00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.950
or the soft towels,
or whatever it is.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:21.630
It's the water
temperature and pressure.

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.420
You would have never
thought of that

00:33:23.420 --> 00:33:26.330
when you were doing your
IDIs and interviewing people

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:28.390
about why they
choose hotel brands.

00:33:28.390 --> 00:33:32.080
And that's an insight
that's very situational

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:33.780
that comes up out of nowhere.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:37.540
And you have to allow for
that in your branding process.

00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:41.420
You have to allow for stuff that
isn't structured to come up,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:43.510
because some of the
greatest bits of creativity

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:45.020
come from that.

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:50.500
So how this all works is you
go through a methodology that

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:53.960
tries to get at the
very unique insights,

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.170
slicing and dicing it every
way, I showed you the data.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:00.240
Once you have a couple of
insights you want to test,

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.870
you can use this M3
methodology that we've

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:07.370
developed with our partner,
which just allows you--

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:10.540
it's an algorithm-- and
it allows you to choose

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:12.980
your favorite choice and
your least favorite choice.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:16.449
So you'd get 16
screens of a choice.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.570
This most reflects
my preference,

00:34:18.570 --> 00:34:19.909
this least reflects.

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:25.010
And what it allows you to
do is find the precise mix

00:34:25.010 --> 00:34:28.480
of messages that support
your insight that

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.989
get you the maximum reach.

00:34:29.989 --> 00:34:32.510
So for example, I would
be able to figure out,

00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:35.210
once I knew something
more about you,

00:34:35.210 --> 00:34:38.480
what four combinations
of messages

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.159
I might need to
communicate to you

00:34:40.159 --> 00:34:43.440
to sell you a new bike, for
example, or a new camera.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:46.130
Those, you can get very,
very specific with it.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:48.442
And it takes some of
the risk out of it.

00:34:48.442 --> 00:34:50.900
And you can see here, this is
an example of just the sample

00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:54.489
size, how it changes when
you test the messages.

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:57.510
The other lesson
is, people think

00:34:57.510 --> 00:35:00.540
it's really easy for people
that are driving brands,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:03.840
or they make products,
to assume that they think

00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:06.640
they know what the messages
are, and you learn so much

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.660
about testing with
just asking people.

00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:12.430
Because sometimes the things you
assume are going to be correct

00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:13.940
aren't.

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:16.450
So I mean, at the
end of the day,

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.730
this is sort of, towards
the end of things,

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.330
we've done this with a bunch of
clients over the last 25 years

00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:24.020
from financial
services companies

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.740
to medical device companies
that are introducing power

00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:32.670
sutures to pharmaceutical
companies to nonprofits.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:35.370
And relevance, if
I could tell you

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:38.260
seven things that are
really important--

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.820
and this can be true for
building personal relevance,

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.670
like in your job or your
team-- is the best brands

00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:46.380
are movements, not products.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:48.710
They're the things that
you spark an insight that

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:52.400
gets people to capture it, and
then they carry it forward.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.010
Those are the best brands.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:57.672
They're not depending on
you putting that content

00:35:57.672 --> 00:35:58.630
out there all the time.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.920
People create the
content for themselves.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:02.910
They help people
tell their stories.

00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:06.120
And there are people--
everybody has different stories,

00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.580
but there are
people that respond,

00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:09.820
there are communities of
people that love and respond

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:13.680
to stories in different ways.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:17.814
Relevance achieves that-- making
people feel better, not worse.

00:36:17.814 --> 00:36:19.230
Having meaning in
this world, even

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:21.160
if you're talking
about cancer, you

00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.100
have to give people something
that touches their compassion,

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.960
their ability to care
for friends and family.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:30.930
They don't want to feel
worse then they already do.

00:36:30.930 --> 00:36:33.740
They want to make new
connections, expand.

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.790
There's something
expansive about it.

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.430
It's easy and it's fun to
self-identify with a brand.

00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:41.640
You feel like that brand
is connecting to you.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:44.070
I mean, I think Chobani does
a really great job of that.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.460
For a pretty broad-based
consumer brand,

00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.769
Chobani does an awesome
job about speaking

00:36:48.769 --> 00:36:49.810
to people where they are.

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.520
They know who they're trying to
reach, and they do a good job.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:54.390
And ultimately,
you're meeting a need

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.200
and you're solving a problem.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.330
I've told you about the work
that the American Cancer

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:00.300
Society does.

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.255
That's a great
example of relevance.

00:37:02.255 --> 00:37:03.880
The second one I
would just talk to you

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.420
is a little bit the
Ocean Conservancy.

00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:07.860
Here's an example
of how relevance

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.370
can make a difference.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.540
They were struggling
with their donations.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:16.140
They wanted to get their capital
campaign or their annual gift

00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:19.030
giving campaign-- it wasn't
where they wanted it to be.

00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:22.450
And their messaging was great,
their website was great.

00:37:22.450 --> 00:37:24.880
But it wasn't doing the job.

00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:26.840
What they found
through the research

00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:29.890
was that instead of talking
to people about the ocean's

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:33.010
health-- like you should
care about the Atlantic Ocean

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:36.010
because the beaches are cleaner
and it's better fishing,

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:39.370
and there's no trash,
and marine life survives.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.300
When people started
connecting the ocean's health

00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:45.700
to their personal health,
that was the a-ha.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:50.330
It's like, if that estuary
gets sick, you get sick.

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.470
If the water doesn't
work on our planet,

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:53.810
that's an enormous problem.

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:59.030
And if you use the right
combination of messages, A,

00:37:59.030 --> 00:38:01.960
to get people to
care, to inspire them,

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:04.720
to connect with them, that
makes a huge difference.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:07.150
So that turned out
to be the message,

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:09.800
connecting the ocean's health
with personal health, that

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.780
made the difference.

00:38:10.780 --> 00:38:14.320
And the analytics and the
data behind the campaign

00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:15.510
showed that.

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.220
So that's a fast
look run-through

00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:19.850
of what relevance in the book.

00:38:19.850 --> 00:38:22.210
And the book is a lot
more about stories

00:38:22.210 --> 00:38:26.110
from my experience in business
and working with clients.

00:38:26.110 --> 00:38:29.420
So thank you for giving me
the opportunity meet you

00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.196
and share it.

00:38:31.196 --> 00:38:32.162
Any questions?

00:38:32.162 --> 00:38:35.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:35.060 --> 00:38:37.330
Nice to meet you.

00:38:37.330 --> 00:38:38.190
Hi.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:40.700
AUDIENCE: How do
you tackle fatigue?

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:45.792
So people, like these brands, if
everyone followed your advice,

00:38:45.792 --> 00:38:47.250
then everyone is
going to find ways

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:49.370
to be more relevant
and more relevant,

00:38:49.370 --> 00:38:52.750
and humans only have so much
attention that they can focus.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:55.370
So is there a way
to handle customers

00:38:55.370 --> 00:38:57.570
just getting fatigued of
being bombarded constantly

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:59.121
by these personalized messages?

00:38:59.121 --> 00:39:00.120
ANDREA COVILLE: I agree.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.578
And that's why I
started it the way

00:39:01.578 --> 00:39:05.400
I did, because I think people
start self-selecting just

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:08.140
when they begin their day
about what they want to do.

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.670
So in this day and age, to
be able to connect with you--

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:15.630
which, from the starting
point, you have to be relevant.

00:39:15.630 --> 00:39:16.410
That's the point.

00:39:16.410 --> 00:39:19.240
First of all, you have
to know enough about you

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:20.780
or a brand that
would appeal to you

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.450
to get that to break through.

00:39:23.450 --> 00:39:26.454
And it's going to get more
intense, not less intense.

00:39:26.454 --> 00:39:28.120
And I think that's
the thing that brands

00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:31.900
need to understand-- the
power of just creating

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.320
more and more information
for us at every-- I mean,

00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:37.280
pretty soon I'm sure it will
be in every device we use,

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:40.950
there'll be some ability
to interact with content.

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:42.960
That content has to be relevant.

00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:46.710
And the other point is, you
can't assume you are relevant.

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.310
I think the biggest
mistake companies

00:39:48.310 --> 00:39:51.179
make are they assume they
have a great conversation

00:39:51.179 --> 00:39:51.970
with their clients.

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:53.690
They assume they,
or their customers,

00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:54.970
they know what they want.

00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:55.610
And they don't.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.770
And it's really hard to regain
relevance once you've lost it.

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.450
If you're making an
assumption that apps aren't

00:40:02.450 --> 00:40:04.562
important in the
business environment

00:40:04.562 --> 00:40:09.130
and you're developing products,
that's a tough, tough thing

00:40:09.130 --> 00:40:11.400
to come back from.

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:13.250
So it's just
listening to people,

00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:15.530
listening to lots
of people, looking

00:40:15.530 --> 00:40:17.910
for unconventional
wisdom and insights.

00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:20.120
Whoever came up with
the Zipcar idea,

00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:23.450
what a great thing, if you think
about an unconventional wisdom

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:25.280
in a pretty conventional market.

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.780
Great example.

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:30.130
[APPLAUSE]
