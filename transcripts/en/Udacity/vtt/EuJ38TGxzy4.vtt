00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.416
However, even a PCP alone may not
solve a coordination problem without

00:00:04.416 --> 00:00:06.173
some electronic assistance.

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.436
It's too complicated for that.

00:00:08.436 --> 00:00:13.425
Let's discuss the care coordination
situation facing the typical

00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:17.896
PCP who sees a lot of chronic
disease patients, like Marla.

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:21.661
Remember there are 14 physicians
involved in the care for

00:00:21.661 --> 00:00:23.248
each of those patients.

00:00:23.248 --> 00:00:28.210
Studies have shown that there
are a total of 86 physicians involved

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.013
in caring for all patients like
Marla in this one PCP's practice.

00:00:33.013 --> 00:00:37.885
Overall, this typical
patient-centered medical

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:42.650
home interacts with 229
physicians each year.
