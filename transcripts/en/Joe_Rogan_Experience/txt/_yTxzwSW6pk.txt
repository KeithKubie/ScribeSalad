Speaker 1:          00:00:03       Three. Two one. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:08       I walked in. You guys were watching soccer. I was hugely disappointed. England's and penalty kill. My God. Is that okay dude? What happened? Like the, we'll cut man, if they, when they move on. So the penalty kick and they just won. They just want England. Just one. They just fucking done. You guys rooting for England? You? I'm English man. I'm happy English. My mom, my mom was born and raised there, bro. I thought what's up bro? I know most people do English. So you really root for England? Yeah. Big Time. No Shit. Yes. I don't know if us isn't in it. You know what's happening when they're playing or do you want me to know when the ball goes in? No, I have kind of an idea. I would say I'm a blue belt in soccer, a blue belt. Wham. Like I wake up early and watch the games.

Speaker 2:          00:00:48       The only world got World Cup, Dude, I was in boulder. You know Boulder's like the People's Republic of Boulder. I don't have to tell you. You're from Colorado. You know what it's like. I went to school. Their son bowlers rough. Yes. It's uh, they're, they're like super duper liberal and people were unnaturally happy about the World Cup, like super excited that they know so much about soccer and yelling. I was at a bar and I was like, that'll make you hate it. That'll make you hate it. But if you just, if you go to England, you'll feel good about it. But he was this certain type of white dude. I, let's see you, you know, I mean, well they probably had a dad that was in the navy or some shit got bullied around at home and they just went the total opposite hard way. No, that shit happens. He's a tough sell.

Speaker 2:          00:01:36       Especially if you're like an athlete, like a black athlete. Oh God. This is like, that's what I know why they struggle a little bit. Like look at the beautiful mountains are like, bitch, I don't hike. I don't give a fuck about your mountains. That's why they struggle. I think recruiting really, it's so beautiful there though. Yeah. Yeah. If you're into fucking hiking and fucking water rafting in shape or super nice too though. They're all right. They don't give a fuck about sports. Where if you go to like a southern school like Georgia, Tennessee, they get pumped. God, oh, every fucking period. Is that bad that they don't care? Is it good? Like balance bat makes your work hard. No, it sucks. You've got nature out there though. Eagles and shit like fucking feature thing sucks. You know that a wolves and bears and wolves and grizzly bears and making their way back into Colorado. Really? Yeah. That goddamn time. Interesting. Why were they gone? They killed them off in the 18 hundreds and then they reintroduced him to Yellowstone and mostly they stayed around Wyoming and Montana or Yellowstone is and they made their way into Idaho, but now they've definitely spotted them in Colorado and they've also a very credible source. In fact, my friend Adam Green tree took video of what he said it was a grizzly bear and he knows the difference. He knows his shit. Yeah. It was in the San Juan Mountains in Colorado last September. So they think

Speaker 3:          00:03:00       that there's a population of grizzly bears. Adam would know. He would know. And if you watch the news, like the local news in La, which I do, especially when I get depressed, you there's, there's a bunch of black bears like a hot tubs in shit popping up in Pasadena chilling. Huh? Why did they love the tubs? Well, they don't know that it's a hot tub. They just know it's water. And so like for them to find a spot that's filled with water, it's probably terrible for them. And once you have a salt pool, they know how hot it is doing. The chlorine, the chlorine, that's what I'm saying. Like it's a bear's drinking all that chlorine goes in that pool. You know what you're doing hot tub. Yeah. That's like, that's dick soup. Conch soup and then black mayors. Yeah. What percentage of hot tubs to people?

Speaker 3:          00:03:41       Fucking 100% is the answer. 100% well in Pasadena expressly Pasadena, they're just rocking it out there. Yeah. There's a lot of bears up there. There's a funny video man at this dude in Pasadena and he's on his phone and he's walking down an alley and as he turns and walks down the aisle and he just on his phone and he's looking down, he's not looking where he's going. He looks up and there's a fucking bear right in front of him and the beer didn't do shit. The bear doesn't know what to do and he just runs really find that dude, homey is just not paying attention. I would shit my pants. Oh yeah, for sure. It's like you saw the, you saw the homeboys in Seattle yet fucked up. Well one died by the mountain lion. Yeah, that's super hungry. Mountain Lion. Yeah, just on a bike.

Speaker 3:          00:04:20       Apparently the mountain lion was a Macy ated. It was all fucked up and sick and it only weighed like 90 something pounds. But it's still fucked. Both of those dudes up. But they, they tell you like, oh, use your bike as a shield and scare them off that Lens. Like, what? I don't give a fuck about your trek button. They hit it with the bike. Apparently it didn't do shit. How about homeboy was like, dude, you're going to attack. I'm going to run and get help. Way to go. Asshole runs off in that line goes where the fuck you going? And they can't kill him. Yeah. Homeboy got away. You know that happened in Beijing to with the lady who got out of the car and a tiger attacked her at the wild animal park. Yeah, that's what you get. She got out of the car. The Tiger tanks are here to stay. Dan. That's a big bear. Big Bear. That's a fucking terrifying bear. So this guy, he's on his cell phone. Where's the uh, that's a big ass beer. Here it is. Here it is. Watch the dudes on his phone.

Speaker 3:          00:05:14       He's like, fuck. Which by the way, the worst fucking thing you could do, just go run. Super Lucky. See if you could pull back. You can see like where the bear walks behind those bushes. Yeah, right here. This is hilarious, dude. Look, the bears walking right there. That guy walks down. He's not even looking. Dude, you're supposed to get loud, right? Like get as big as possible. Yes. You definitely don't want to run away because their instincts that have chase. Yeah, but they say when you get loud and like challenge them like you hear about that, it's fine. I don't want him having your about that boy scout leader know who they rent. They solid bear and you know it's like play dead or, or do your thing, you know, or you know when you play dead or get real big and loud. Like they don't know exactly what to do.

Speaker 3:          00:05:56       But I bet I guess the boy scout fucking handbook says to get loud and like make a scene. I'm gonna Forget loud made a scene and that beer was like, oh cool. Hey kids watch this. Atum asshole first and from the whole squad. Oh No. Yeah. So they don't, I don't think they know exactly. Well the problem is bears are just like every other animal, right? Like think about dogs. All dogs are different men. Some dogs just come over to their house and they're like, hey, what's going on? How are you doing? And it's some dudes, you come over to their house and dog's checking you out and like, I dunno motherfucker. I'm not sure about you, Austin. They get around you and the hair comes up and you're like, oh my God, his hair's up the worst. Your dog has his hair up. What's going on here?

Speaker 3:          00:06:33       I think bears are probably just like dogs and they're just, they vary. They say. It also depends where you're at. Like they walked into his cave so he's like, you're in my house. Give me that ass hole. It's terrifying. I don't think if you're that cub scout you're like, oh my God. Apparently the worst thing that could happen is you walk into a female with their cubs game over a female grizzly with her cubs. She'd just light you up, do you don't have no chance. It's not like you're going to, what do you do? I was listening to some bitch on the news because they're talking about black bears in hot tubs and few run into one. This lady is saying, go, solar's punch him in the nose on my nose. They're noses are super sensitive or go for the eyes. Yeah, let me try that.

Speaker 3:          00:07:12       They bite each other's faces. You people have to understand like when they fight with each other, which they do all the time, they do all the time. They're always fighting for sure. There's in person fight in the wild. I've seen it. They just fight, especially during the Rut, like in the springtime, they fucking bite each other's faces and it doesn't even look like anything happen. They bite the shit out of each other and nothing happens. So you contacting clothes with you little bitch ass hands. Like what are you going to do? Cowan has an old bit where, uh, it's, he did on a special, so he won't mind me saying it. We count as a little bit where people would go, oh, just punk punch a shark in the nose. Secure, tried punching underwater. He's like all slow. I've taught that exact same thing. I've thought that exact same thing.

Speaker 3:          00:07:58       Like how much could you generate underwater? Like people go under water to work out. You've seen that famous photo of Ali. Ali used to do a lot of shadow boxing in the water water and John recreated it. Have you seen John John's one? It's fucking dope. That's right. Know GSP does a lot of work in the water. He was the first one I knew it was doing work in the water and actually for, I mean months would drive down to Laguna Niguel where he's working out and we do water workouts and we're in the pool when the pool for like two hours. I was like Bro, I did it for two weeks and think it, he goes, you coming in on Wednesday and I go, oh worst. Just the worst. That sounds more like someone with a mental disability from that sounds like a rice. I like Stephen Hawking.

Speaker 3:          00:08:40       Definitely sound like someone who doesn't know English. That good. Not Good. So anyways because you come in on Wednesday, I won't do that cause then again and I was like Nah, I'm not man. I'm thinking of fucking pull. You'd be in there for like two hours. He'd have these things. You just have been doing this stuff. He does a lot of jumping, which is really interesting. I was thinking about, I was like, yeah, you could generate maximum force, like jumping in the water and it's probably like real easy on the joints in comparison. It's easy on the joints. But um, I was listening to one expert talk about it. Um, actually I think Loren Landow is telling me this, he's a strength coach for the Denver Nuggets, the Denver Broncos. Now he was saying it's good to mix in, but to do it every week all the time, especially in the sand or water, you're not going the same explosiveness.

Speaker 3:          00:09:22       You're not generating the same explosive power. So you should mix it up. Yeah, he goes, if you're just doing that, you're actually, it's actually gonna make you less explosive. Wow. See though, she just, B plus p begs to differ like land out. But those dudes that are just on the cutting edge, they're constantly let comparing studies and just trying to get that little extra edge. And it is so interesting now. It's so like the world of strength and conditioning has never been like more complicated because there's no more bro Science. They'll also, because there's actual experts are like, you can look it up now, right? Like back in the day, my buddy like, dude, just eat fucking egg whites, which we know the terrible thing. Just the eggs and drink milk and get fucking swole. You wish that no. Everyone had all sorts of weird fucking diets or just take this Bsn enecto explode and you'd be jacked, Bro.

Speaker 3:          00:10:07       Yeah. There's so many variables still. There's still some some variables, but when it comes to like the guys that get paid big bucks to train top level athletes, they seem to all be kind of on the same page, correct? No, Lauren Endo is one of my best friends at plyometric stuff. A lot of plyometrics. They all, usually they all agree on similar things. Like they might have this variation here, this variation here, but most of them agree on the same fucking thing. Potatoes. No one's saying you need to be power lifting only and no one's, yeah, no one's doing anything stupid. A lot of them are saying, you know, doing like Max reps and and multiple days and all this stuff, like that's not the way to go anymore. [inaudible] days are over, but I say fuck that noise. I still do the meat head days like sometimes like whatever fun to be a mean Italian, get those jeans shorts out.

Speaker 3:          00:10:57       Yeah. Nice. Three hour workout for Ross was looking for Deca. Frost was given us some insight into that, that like his philosophy on training, what he said it was the most interesting thing. He's a smart, smart man by the smartest people get, but one of the more interesting things that he said was that you should never feel sore. He's like, you should work out. You should build yourself up to the point where you never feel sore. It never push yourself past your limit should never be like, ah, never. It's like working out or training too. He was talking about training and talking about everything he was talking about. Just do more, do more of a day. Interesting. Yeah. He was saying that if you do like sets it like do a set at like here, here's a for instance, I'm taking it out of context.

Speaker 3:          00:11:43       This is example. Yeah. It was like if you did um, certain amount, I forget the numbers he was talking about, but if you did a certain amount of work, let's just to paraphrase, say if you do a 20 ups and do two sets of 20 chin ups, he like barely can get 20 and you're burnt out afterwards and your wrecked or instead of that you're doing 40 reps, right. Either way, do 40 of them throughout the day, but do it five reps at a time, but do the same amount of work. How would hold your stamina? It's a good question but the idea being, well I think it's a different thing, but the, the idea being like to get yourself into this position where you can train hard, especially with like physical fitness type stuff shouldn't break your body down totally. You should just give your body enough of a chance to fully recover and then build up.

Speaker 3:          00:12:29       I think we have to be a little careful with it because for us specialize in mixed martial arts where there so many disciplines, right? Where you can't go balls to the wall and strength condition. You can't just break yourself with wrestling. You can't just go hard and sworn. You have to kind of monitor those things and figure it out. So I think it's a little bit of bias thing. He's right. I think as far as it goes, as mixed martial arts, Loren Landow has been saying that forever cause I'd go super hard in the weight room. He's like, I'm telling you tonight you have wrestling, you'd be screwed, man. Got To figure this out. You've got to figure out this form with a man. That was a long time ago. Yeah. They think that doing weightlifting and lower reps more often is a way to do it.

Speaker 3:          00:13:04       Yes. It's fucking interesting man. But when you train for a fight, you're going to have to push yourself, right? If you're going to, there's going to be certain things like whether it's hill sprints or whatever it is. I mean, you're going to push yourself to the limit and I remember [inaudible] is Bisbing NGS. We had the same concept and trading with both of them are busy being, he would go so hard in practice. I kissed his, his, when he would warm up his repetition, striking, hitting Mitts, wrestling, Jujitsu, everything was super high and they come, this is where I get my card here from. I'm doing the actual sport of it. I'm not going to go run fucking sprints. Right. Just gonna do more wrestling rounds and GSP was very similar. You'd go super hard in that aspect. Yeah. GSP was a wizard with that stuff, man.

Speaker 3:          00:13:47       I mean, he was always at the cutting edge and it came to doing gymnastics member who was really into gymnastics with them, meaning Mark Hart and him would do it together. So interested in big ass. I'd watch them do all these flips, flops, iron man, let me try this bullshit. Fucking cartwheel. And they're like, very good man. It's good. You're getting better. You're better than fuck you guys. Does anybody your size do that stuff? It's gotta be some the biggest one in there for sure. And the rest were all eight year old girls who are just monsters. Nate and just pee. I should look like this big Shrek character in the gymnastics is probably like the sport that gets dudes the most jacked when you see like ring guys tiny though. Right? But there.

Speaker 3:          00:14:29       Well, do you ever seen a skinny midget, you're skinny, small person I've ever seen. Like a real thin, small person. Just how, sorry. Small Person. Uh, they're all jacked. Are they? No fat asses. They're all jagged bat houses, Bro. I don't think it's the same thing we're talking about here. I'm saying the smaller, I know they're small though. Third Jack. Like if like if Lebron got in gymnastics, he's not going to be Jack. Well what's the average size of a like an Olympic gymnast? Five three or the really tiny, tiny, stocky Jack Jack. But they've also been lifting like that since like four months old. All I was getting at, sorry, before your horrific, no, I correct this scale. Herbalist rant. Uh, do you know what a Buddhist is? The newest thing? No. What to say? If you make fun of someone who has a disability, you're able ablest including stupid people.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       Tall gymnast is no oxymoron. Okay. The average height for adult male gymnast is around five four to five. Seven. Johnathan Horton is listed as five one five six five eight five. The tallest one is my height. Five, eight. I mean he's like the Dikembe Mutombo tall [inaudible]. Who's the tallest? This is like the tallest girl was like five. Two. Oh Jesus. So that makes sense. I mean, our stud, does it say gymnastics stunts growth? Is that really what they think? They start super young, said that bright pillow that there was an article. Does gymnastics stunt growth? Is that a real question? Whether it's done script, right. That's what I'm saying. Is that a real question? Let's see. Click it. Well, they say lifting young stunt your growth. Right? I heard that. But how do they know that they don't even listen? Why aren't you in fourth grade?

Speaker 3:          00:16:13       Why aren't you maybe you'd be fucking super giant if you did. I should have been fucking with the gymnastics. What does it say? Hold on a second. Stunts growth explained. Hmm. I don't remember tall. Maybe there's drawn to it. You know, maybe the short people are drawn to it. Makes Sense. Well for it's absolutely a myth says u s gymnastics scientific community is an entirely sure, but the idea that gymnast's would have grown to be a foot taller for they'd only hadn't spent the time on the parallel bars is absolutely a myth. The best in the world is four eight that's Simon Bio biles is four eight Simone, some girl bro. Simone, don't Miss Gender. Her friends call her assignments son talking about Sim sims four April essentially see that recovery. That's a crazy sport man. When like everything is like ready, set, go. It's all about doing it in one moment, right?

Speaker 3:          00:17:11       Someone says go, you know it's there and then you have to nail it and every a foot you have a routine is you've got to hit a cop at all. Came over, so over a little slip, all those bunts and you watched gymnastics. I'll watch a little bit. You won't watch World Cup. I watch World Cup. I'm just fucking with you. I'm just sent you understand. Look, if you, if I find out something you like, I'm going to start mocking it. That's how we do tell. We do, I'll tell me do, I'm just kind of make fun. If you can make fun of some shit that I like, man. I like a lot of dumb shit. You know how much dumb shit you did bring back fanny pack. So I brought them back strong. [inaudible] says, yeah, you're will get credit for you and cro cop though. Let's be real.

Speaker 3:          00:17:50       You got to give Kroger Europeans less courageous because they'd been doing it forever over there. But as far as you as, as far as the u s is me and Hulk Cogan no hope. Got Rid of a long time ago. Okay, well we, we cross bridges. He had it and I had at the same time, it's like a coke relaying. What did he let it Tom? Oh, years ago. Let it go. Know that sex date. Can we said fuck that. I bet he's still got one. No, no way. I bet he does. Back in the day at Gold's guys would have them, they'd be steroids in those. They would shoot up what? Their little bag? Yeah, he could buy it off of him. Look at that, the hot seat and have one there. That's pretty recent. Those four GTECH had a shitload of back surgeries, man. Yeah. No Shit.

Speaker 3:          00:18:32       Would you expect was going to happen the wrestling he is. I believe so. Ww eating. I heard that. Yeah. Probably for like Wrestlemania appearance or something. Yeah. Well that's amazing. And Chuck Liddell and Tito are fighting, so what else you got? What do you think of that? Not My cup of tea, but you know I used to watch it. I for sure. Well, to watch it, we'll watch campaign for it. There's some people say it shouldn't happen, right? No, I see. I don't think it shouldn't happen. I look at it more like if I see, I think if Chuck Liddell was still employee of the UFC getting paid $400,000 just to chill or whatever he was doing for the USC, he would not be fighting. I think it's more of a money play, which bums me out because I think chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz, what they did for the sports should be compensated for the rest of their lives.

Speaker 3:          00:19:14       I you bumps me out. They have to fight to make money. That bumps me up. I don't know if Tito does so much cause he was very smart. Chuck, you know it, it seems like maybe that's the what's going on there, but, but he also has been saying, no, you got to wonder what, where this is coming from. But he has been saying that he misses it and it's the who was his favorite thing. I miss that. He misses it. Yeah, but it's different. Like if, if we're going to live forever, if we're going to live forever, I would say, yeah, definitely don't do it because you're just going to keep damaging yourself if you're not going to live forever.

Speaker 3:          00:19:50       He's 48 so let's say we're going to live to a hundred let's say chuck lives a hundred homes. He's halfways and being friendly right now. Let's say he's going to live to a hundred never know. Athletes don't let us in brother. Oh, I have another one. Am I? I'm 35 30 solid years left to be. So let's say chuck is going to Madison's Sun Science. I knew shit. I'm big though. Great hands. Great Danes Bro. So let's say he lives to a hundred he's basically halfway there. Dude, at the halfway mark fighting. It's just, it can't be healthy man. Like imagine me in 50 fighting Joe. And you're the exception, you know, like you're in phenomenal shape it. Yeah, but I don't want to get hit. You don't get hit in the face. It's not going to be pretty. Not In the head. Especially if you had all those years of, listen, I'm not hating on it. There's a market for it. Do your thing. I took, like I said, to me it's more of a sad story. I think they should be compensated or like I want them to parlay their careers like a Michael Stray Han or Kobe Bryant, you know, where through legends and

Speaker 2:          00:20:48       then they move on to do great things. I agree. But I also, if they wanted to compete, it was because they wanted to compete. I wonder where it makes sense to tell them they can't or they shouldn't because if they want to do it, if they both want to do it, like if they had money and they're like, oh, so what is it about? Is it the motivation that bothers me? Like what is it about a fight like that is the fee. I think it's the motivation. Yeah. I cringe a little bit right half a little bit because see, I think Tito did better financially. You know? I think Tito is fine. He did really well in Bella Torah. He might actually want this fight just to fight chuck again. I think so. I think Tito Tito's a different trajectory. Correct? Yeah. I mean he's been fighting and doing well any last few years, you know?

Speaker 2:          00:21:40       Yeah. He's, he's still a formidable guy. Yeah. He's a beast to those. A big fella. Yeah. Both. Great guys. Now, I will say this, everyone who's fighting in these older leagues or if they, if golden boy, if that's your thing to do like these, this master league, every one fight in that league, better pray to the MMA. God's view Bell Balfour. It does not enter that fucking thing. Juice to the gills. Yes, you better. She's amazing. Fantastic. So happy with, we'll, we'll kick the fuck out of all those old dudes at the same time. He really, well dude, I was looking at his Instagram the other day. I was like, oh my God. Yeah, there's something happens to veto or when he fills up with super unleaded dude, it's like he a butter and Jelly. He's a different and doing roids bro. Like some people don't, don't, don't do well with Roy to get all red and shit.

Speaker 2:          00:22:27       He looks great. His skin vibrant is tits or popping. He's all tans teeth get wider. He's doing straight testosterone. He's not mean when he was on, see, think about this, right? We know for sure. We all know absolutely 100% that people have cheated and taking steroids and got away with it. We know that. I know you know that especially in fighting, especially when the weigh ins where the only day you had a pee and there was no randoms, they didn't just come by. We know for a fact, but when you watch someone who's just doing testosterone and what else is doing with a tumor growth hormone and plead fucking gigantic now. I love that. I love it too. But what you get there, it's a different thing. Like for Vituro like something happens with him. Like when you, when they allowed him to take it, like during the Rockhold fight, Bisping fight dude, his body ate it up.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       But that's it. It's a kind of a different thing because you're, it's like it's above board. Right. Let me let them do it so he doesn't feel guilty about it. You feel me? Cause he still, he's finding a way where it's still legal. Yeah. When he was doing it, yeah, he was doing it legally. It was doing it leaving. He got permission from the UFC to do it. Yeah. The commission. So it as much you want to say if you go back before he did it like a, you see when he sexy Yama. Yes. Dude. His, his body didn't look nothing like that. It looked like a welterweight. Right? And everyone wants to go. A lot of people go, oh, he did steroids with whatever sports. Sammy Sosa, Mark McGuire, Barry Bonds. You take steroids. Try hitting those fucking homeruns. Everyone was doing it in fighting. A lot of people were doing, I'm, I can say names if so when Jon Jones tested hot against DC, right?

Speaker 2:          00:24:09       Whatever he does hot for. If DC was doing the same stuff, would he have beat John? The answer's no. What was a very close fight up until that head kick, right? It was a good fight. You don't, you really never know what could have happened. I'm just saying about high level fighting. Right? Correct. However, but however that's what happens. We have to judge it based on that. If they are taking the same stuff, whatever you want to say, John took. But if DC was saying, do you think the outcome would've been any different? My answer's no. If they were taking the same stuff. I see the John Thing, we've gone over this, but we probably should go over this again. If anybody doesn't know the actual, the numbers, he tested negative, then he tested positive for a minuscule amount, was really small and then he tested negative again.

Speaker 2:          00:24:52       So whatever happened happened in a very short window and it was incredibly small amount of whatever that stuff was. Some call it micro dosing. Yeah. It could be that. Maybe we don't, we don't know really. Yeah. The thing about it is that stuff is supposed to stay in your system for a long time. It would be a stupid thing to take because supposedly it's in your system for weeks, but we don't, we don't. Yeah. And also the micro dosing Shit is real folks. That's real. I mean that's what they were doing in baseball. They were taking testosterone, gummy bears and they would only last like three or four hours and decided we arrived, belies it today. Or I would eat them during the game. Yeah. Yeah. And then by the time the game was over, it's out of the system. Yeah. And baseball with that was the testing baseball players was that dumb as shit, but it was one of those weird American things like everybody's [inaudible] but if we had the Russians attitude about this, just be cool man.

Speaker 2:          00:25:48       If, I mean, what is it like, like how do the Russians feel about like that documentary Icarus where that guy came on and claim that all the Russian athletes were on steroids. They don't get to dress like, yeah, no shit buddy. Anyways, whatever. Let it go over it. Get over it man. Kill a few whistleblowers over here. Don't mind us. Come over here. Let me know how it works out for you. Yeah, yeah. Um, but wonder, but that's the stuff was steroids. I think we put too much, we almost put too much emphasis on the steroids. They don't get wrong and get fucking helps and helps a lot of guys. But if, if everyone was on the same thing, John Jones is still be the grace all time. He'd still on being defeated. Brock Lesnar. It's still be Brock Lesnar. I think Kane would still be canes. They'd still be it. I think everything would be the exact same. I gotta I gotta be serious here, man. I think you're right. If everybody was on, the results would be the same if everybody was on. The problem is like some people like the tour, just, it just, his body

Speaker 3:          00:26:44       loves it. He's made for his body's made for TRT replacement. It's crazy. Yeah. So I mean, you know, good luck. Good luck. Good luck. Do that. Now that he's in the wild west of Brazil and he's looking for stuff on his Instagram, we talked on his Instagram, he finds his fan and you're like, how long have you been a fan? He's all begin and Brown. If you want to see me fighting, those gets goes, let's do it. Like gives them a wink. I'm like, yeah, who's going to sign up to fight that fucking monster? But here's the thing. How does he get out of his contract? Does UFC still have them under contract or did he retire? He retired, but that, but just because you retired and I know, cause I retired. Your contract isn't void. It's frozen. They're very smart, but it's veto. Balfour.

Speaker 3:          00:27:27       I highly doubt all he's done for the UFC. I guarantee you can talk to let them go. I would let them go out. Assume yeah, that would be nice if they did. The scary thing about chuck is Dana, who's obviously very close with chuck for a long time. I don't know if they're so close anymore. Dana, this is Dana gone. She says, I don't think he should be fighting like I don't want to see him fight again. I sure as fuck went limp fight here. I hope he stopped and went on close to the situation. So then I'm like, Oh God, but he's going to do what he's gonna do. Chuck versus Vituro was one of the first fights I ever called completed his contract with the UFC last month and a lost Liotta Machita but it doesn't mean he's retiring. The phenom took to social media to hint a return as fans who they would like to see him fight next.

Speaker 3:          00:28:10       Always. He's good then. That's usual free tour though. His choices were a bit curious. Who is he asking a fight? Vandelay. He asked the fan, so he said [inaudible] Chuck, Tito, Bisbing or handle? Well, hand on business, not happening. Truck t door. Manderly you're telling me you wouldn't watch fan ugly Vitorin I would go for that. I would watch that. What if, so imagine of Tito and chuck fight and chuck wins. Chuck wants to fight again. He wants to fight Vituro again. Pete v tour in UFC 37 and a half and now it's like we're back to the future. Yeah. Text. Chuck might please don't fight via tour. He's a fucking I fee. I feel like it's different with, but wait a minute, we don't know. Chuck was clean. How about get chuck on the super soft, the ultimum iceman sets truck in a round 48 years old sound.

Speaker 3:          00:29:02       You can't be eating mangoes and dates and fucking almond butter and think you're going to compete with a sauce Dot v tour. I didn't think of that. Come on golden boy. Yeah, you get that fucking, yeah. You can't fuck with any legitimate organizations. All these with all these organizations that want to sneak up on you in the middle of the night and test your key now plan, come on golden stairs. Take a break. How about, how about, uh, there's guys like Josh Barnett and even Leo. Leo said, this goes with signed with the UFC because of you sada enough. See they've all been busted previously so that they have a little different. You have an agreement with them, but they're saying, listen. Well Josh Barnett was not bust by right.

Speaker 2:          00:29:41       They came out. He never took anything. We lost a year of his career. Yeah. I don't understand the Josh Barnett case. I'd like to have him explain it cause it sounds like what I've read sounds like he got fucked. No, he did tell me what you know, they admit it. They know for a fact he did not write like they came out that same thing. Like they've had other guys, right? Like the, the, the dirty bird. What's his name? Tim means he means they came out that are bad over the counter or something. Yeah. It's all good. Right. It took like some protein powder that was slightly contaminated and that came out as true and with Josh Barnett, it took a year to figure this out and then they go my bad bro. Yeah, yeah. I know he missed a year. And in your, you know, older fighter, it's a year of not getting paid.

Speaker 2:          00:30:23       My Bat, you're back, you're welcome back now and Barnett's gone fuck this man. I'm out. Is that really what they did? I promise you that's what they did. See, that seems to me to be a case where you've made an error that should be, you should compensate that fight. That's what I'm saying. He should be fully compensated that he should have went force a guy. If you made the mistake, that's that's like a, I mean I'm not a business person, but if I was a business person I'd be like, well this is a clear case of someone owing someone money because you fucked up. But what, what the you saw, I was going to say it was an investigation took us that long to figure it to get to the bottom of it. That's the process. But they were wrong. Right. So if they were wrong, so all their investigation stuff they did that took so long to get to the bottom of you accused the guy who's innocent, right?

Speaker 2:          00:31:10       Yeah. But see they say potentially flagged for PDS, right? They don't say what you're flagged for and then it goes into investigation, but they're not, they don't say he was, he suspended, he taught test pilots for this. They say potentially flagged and there's an investigation then took a year to figure that out. I think that they, the, you sought a like, especially, uh, under the whatever guidelines that they had coming in here had a lot to work with. Right. There's a lot of fighters. You got to figure out who's he got to test this one more tonight. I mean, it must be crazy, but it must be a nightmare. I'm not saying it's an easy job. I, I, I think it's too much a very hard job and I'm thinking it's too much to this 500 fighters on roster, but with a legend like Josh Barnett, he deserves respect.

Speaker 2:          00:31:58       That's the youngest ever heavyweight champion. Agreed. Joanie's. He's one of my favorite fighters and he's probably one of the smartest maneuver. Grace the octagon. He's such a smart, very smart. I love Judge Brennan. However, if you're Novitsky and you look at the history of Josh Barnett, there's a reason to have skeptical golden snitch eyes on him because he's tested positive previously. Right. That's what's going on. See what you're saying. You know what I'm saying? Like if you have a track record, like I'm going to test over him a tad more Vittorio, tad more than steeple. You DC, like I just look at DC, be like, no, you're good dude. You're fucking super unleaded. DC. DC's 40 years old son, DC's 40 years old on the Nash, which is some powerful fucking genetics. Just to get him on that super sauce kid, Bro. Get them on that v Tour Shit that gives you veins in your teeth. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:32:49       phase in your ears. Got here, dude, killer dude. When he was, there was a time when [inaudible] was a, there were had to face off with him and Rockhold and you look at Vitara like how he was when he was doing the Mohawk to get a sting ray hanging off the back of his neck like a fucking sting ray with back then. His traps were like, they look so scary, dude. And this is even at the Wayans man. This was when, the way is where the real way in, which I called told me, he goes, you looked right at him. He's like, what the fuck is this? But just one straw coming out of the eyeballs. Just fucking tears of wind strong. It was just testosterone. It was just whatever they let her take was on other things too. Oh my God. I don't know what he was on.

Speaker 2:          00:33:29       It's hard to tell from that picture cause he's an actual one 85 right there. Oh my favorite fighters deflated. It's amazing the difference between some guys like when they weigh in, like Joelle, when he weighs in at one 85 he's still looks super ridiculous. Uber jacked at one 85 you can't believe he only weighs one 85 and he gets a note scale, but then he fucking, he mean he just puts all that meat back on your boy, your boy a Whitaker was like that mother fuckers. Yeah. Here's interview is like, [inaudible] said it was magic. He's like, it's magic. See that man. Go from that to that. And he goes, I honestly find them before and he's aging and this time he was even harder. He's like, something's up their son. Yeah. Um, here's the thing. Maybe, but you know what else may be may be crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:34:17       Cuban genetics. I think that shit would be crazy. There's young genetics, but how much more impressive whether whatever it is on, let's say is on something where it could beat him twice. Yeah. There should not be a third fight. I don't think this decision was just in the second fight. Now you're crazy. I think there should have been 10 eights. No, I think I did. The new rules I think should've been a draw that I don't think you all won that fight. If any. If you're going to give you all a ten eight then that's a draw or draw them and I don't think they give drawls out enough. I will draw them, find her because then they're forced to have that trust in him saying that I'm fine with. I didn't think that a decision. I thought like there's too many moments in the fight where Yo el hurt Whitaker like really hurt.

Speaker 2:          00:34:58       There was no moments in the fight where Widdick really hurt you. Well like really hurt him. Like had them in deep trouble. There was one that head kick the wobbling a little bit [inaudible] the head cake was when Dow, I don't think that even fucking did much it why would his legs a tad bit. But if you go round by round, watch that fight a bunch. I think I was a good, that was like he landed with the foot right [inaudible] face top of the head. But also like you go round by round. I just stylistically, I had Whitaker winning three, two and I, let's say I gave you out when he fucked him up that there was a fourth, a fifth in that I think it was both rounds. You have him in trouble. I gave one to 10 90 you all and then if you give a ten eight youth, it would still be a draw.

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Right? Which I'm fine with, which makes more sense to me. People have a hard time with decisions when the guy at the end of the fight is fucking the guy up. Now obviously this is coming from someone who's a professional commentator, so I understand this is a ridiculous argument, but the ridiculous argument is if we're going to judge what a fighter is, we all know if you're watching a fight fight, right? If you and I are in a fight and you're on top of me beating the shit out of me in the last few seconds when the cops come in, that doesn't matter if I, if I've ran around this room and kicked your legs for the first two minutes and then you got on top of me and we're beating the fuck out of me for the last 20 seconds when the cops can talk in prison rules, you won the fight.

Speaker 2:          00:36:19       He won the fight in the fight. But as a professional sport, understand, but this is a professional sport that's kind of a fight in boxing. If I win the first eight rounds, right, and you're whooping my ass, nine 10 1112 it was first day. What do we do there it is. It's a good no, it's real good point dude. It's a real good point. But the idea is, see that didn't hardly all he was on wobble. Q is already tired. Dude, look how wobbly he is already there. How about the kicks by fucking Whitaker tickers? So good dude. And the fact that he fought that fight, most of it with a fucking broken hand, broken him with one's brown and being with one like the first fight gone. No, he's how phenomenal the through that hand to even when, Oh look, you've got cloud. He was in trouble for Shit couple times.

Speaker 2:          00:37:02       I had one round of ten eight so that'd be a draw. See this right here. This is a ten eight man. This is a ten eight again, even if you give a tenant, it's still, it should be a draw. Then maybe you wouldn't win the fight. Okay. What draw? Two guys are fighting. It's a close round, but one guy drops the round, drops him and has him hurt. They're like everything up until that moment. His clothes, I think that's still a ten eight geesh. Toss, tossing ten eight, ten eight. It's got to be the differences. Someone almost got finished. This is an almost got finished moment. The legs go, the person falls, the guy gets on top, starts pounded them to see. I don't have a problem with ten nine that I think has to be a clear fucking bully beat down for ten eight I think that should be a ten seven I think we should make this shit makes sense.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       Game. I mean flat white and five and 10 set. If you gotta stop, you gotta stop slow. I really feel like this scorecard, this, this 10 point must system silly the whole thing. Silly the judging, but the silly things. Yeah, you're right. We've been, we've kicked that fucking whore. The numbers. Like why do we need 10 points? Just because boxing always had 10 points. They're only using their hands. They're not even using their elbows. You know? Just think about all the different things. Like how what's worth more is a jab worth more than an elbow. Yeah. Yeah. What's worth more a gea teen choke that you get out of how much, how many points you get for that? I've got to figure that out, man. But it's also predicated off styles too. Cause what happens if, let's say I'm Brian Ortega, let's take Brian and take a mex hallway and Max Hallway on the feet jabbing good distance control, and Brian really can't get it going.

Speaker 2:          00:38:29       But then he pulls, guard, pulls guard, and he's fucking throwing armbar triangle leg and Max is kind of defend. But he's in trouble. Yeah. They're not given that to Brian down there. Right. They don't know shit about the ground game that they'll get Max on Tom real well when it was on the feet, he landed more jabs. Let's give it to a fucking Max. Yeah. There's moments where a regular guy is on his back and they're right. Correct. It doesn't have a good guard or a guy who just tries to hang on until the referee pulls them off. But then there's some dudes who have, their guard is like the scariest place to be. You gotta you gotta know what you're dealing with. You've got you to know the premises. You got to remember that Kid Paul Sas. Fuck yeah. Won So many fights by triangle, man.

Speaker 2:          00:39:09       It was ridiculous. You see that guy fight off of his back. He'd be like, whoa. Yep. He's moving quick. He was closing shit up quick. Dude's didn't know what the fuck was happening and all of a sudden they're jacked and triangled. Dude, how about that? Max Holloway Brian or take a flight. That's a greatest fight at 45 cents. Connor and Aldo. Yeah, I agree. I agree. It's such a dangerous fight for Max. It's a dangerous fight for both guys. I mean this is the first, well for Ortega, it's not his first time in worldclass territory. Right. He had cub and he had Frankie wolf one bolted them in spectacular fashion I think in this. Frankie never been done. Never been done before. But the crazy thing I thought just as crazy, maybe more crazy was the way finish cub. He almost got cub in the first round cup is a real Brazilian Jiu Jitsu blackbelt free and I know that Max finished cub as well, but cub was hurting that fight.

Speaker 2:          00:39:59       I think he had either a broken jaw or had he went into the fight. Injured. Yeah, some was fucked up. Something went real bad during the fight. Anyway. You know all credit to Max. He did finish him, but it was the way when they went to the ground or take a locked up that Doris at the end of the first round, I was like, Jesus standing tight. It was, this was tied to man when they went to the ground and they were when it was, when he was cinching it up and then the buzzer went off. I'm like, second step dad, that fights over. That's fine. That was a tight fucking, he did the exact same thing again. He went, oh cool, cool. He just knew he could do it. The thing is his Jujitsu as at such a fucking high level, he's so dangerous.

Speaker 2:          00:40:42       You can't really train for it either, like just just being in the room with Dortay guts. You've seen triangles, you've seen arm bars. The way he sets up, it's so explosive in the angles he hits. You can't bring anyone into to duplicate that to me, so different and what's crazy about Brian says story like he's a guy who's not going to go on and talk shit. He comes from a super humble background and his, his demeanor inside that octagon when even early on his UFC career when the, it was not going well for him and he found some way to, he's finished all fighters, so found some way to get it done. And I think it comes from growing up in that rough background, man. It doesn't fluster him. He's like, I just, I need something he never gives up. He's like, hey, something's going to come.

Speaker 2:          00:41:22       Something's going to come. And I think that's huge in this Max Holloway fight. Cause Max distance control is fucking second to none, man. It's gonna be tough for Brian to get in there. I think once Brian can get an hook, I think we're gonna see him jump to half guard. Something like that. It's going to be interesting. It's going to be interesting to see a Brian can turn into a Jujitsu match. But the thing about Brian is he so comfortable with his hands, man. He's getting more company for sure and doesn't train that doesn't have like a super team. Yeah, he's amazing. But Max Holloway, dude, when I saw the second fight with Aldo, the second fight with Aldo, there were some moments in that fight where I was like, Geez, he's one of my favorite foods. Dues on another level now. But he was overwhelming Aldo.

Speaker 2:          00:42:00       Like he went into that fight, you know, and the basically when they announced the, this is where his phrase, uh, where it started to hit me, it is what it is. You know, as I said, I love it. That was his attitude to go fight an absolute future hall of Famer who was thought to be the greatest featherweight of all time. A guy who, you know, think about some of the spectacular at Kaos of Chad Mendez. And I mean, he was a monster when he was young. So the Cub Swanson flying knee in Wec, dude, he was a based and for her collar that fight and be like, it is what it is. Like it is what it is. The flux, that man, he just smashed him. Just was gonna fight. Fucking could be. Oh yeah. And he would've if they'd ref if commission mission let off.

Speaker 2:          00:42:44       If the commission did pull him off, the weight cut he would have fought. Could be about like how many days notice what was that? Eight days? Yeah, some days when curriculum. That's not much of a bad ass. He is super short notice. I also think the reason why I love this fight and so good for the UFC, especially just for the both of them is Max and Brian are going to fight multiple times this I think so. I think this needs to become a cool rivalry. We're going to see him go from 45 whoever wins this, I don't really care who I love both those men. I fucking love both those guys. Whoever wins. I think eventually they're both huge for the weight class and Max is young in Brian, they're going to go to 55 even Max's team goes, he, he should be a 55 and he's fucking huge for 45 well you think about how much weight he had to lose to get to 55 then I know he, they pulled them off the weight cut to 55 which is crazy.

Speaker 2:          00:43:29       55 there's some flight for them. I think. And this is great for fighters, man. Like with, with Aldo, he was never that big until Connor came. Right? And there's this rivalry DC, John Jones, Nate Diaz con like there's these Raleigh Frazier, me shook Rhonda, there's all, you know Holly run, there's all this stuff starting to happen and then people fucking tune in. So I think for Brian and Max, they don't need to talk any shit. They just keep being humble. Their skills speak for themselves, but the people want to tune in for that. And you're going to get a bunch of flights out of these guys, man. And I think you're probably right on my Dick's hard about it. I know. I love it, man. I get goosebumps talking about those fucking too. Yeah, they're pretty bad ass. It's nice to see, uh, just anytime you have a guy who's defending his title and you have a guy who you legitimately think could be a champion and you see, look, you look at the two of them.

Speaker 2:          00:44:16       Like I look at that fight and I go, I don't know. I don't know what's going on. Yeah, I don't either. I just don't know if Max makes one mistake by capitalize on it buying so dangerous, so dangerous. What's interesting to me is when I first met Brian Gears going, he's in the gym, remember he was mopping mats, just doing his thing and Henry would bring them on the road. He even goes on the road now with Hennen. They teach cops there, their tactical stuff and why they do these seminars. And he was like Ken or little guy and I was, took him serious cause Jitsu was ridiculous and he would train with me and all this stuff. But I never thought best in the world, you know, I've never eaten. Now I know I'm new. I'm like, what's up man? And I seen it when, when they told me, cause I caught him for a fight and then, um, they go, dude, you fcs come in Colorado.

Speaker 2:          00:44:59       Not yet. Uh, you know, I'm cautious, Larry. I'm like, no, no, no, no, no, no, please. He has to work on a stamp. Don't fucking let them do it, man. And then Henry was like, dude, he wants to do it. And then fucking, I was way off that motherfucker. He got good with his hands with fast. He steps up to the level of competition, man. Well, he definitely does, but it's also, he's so good at Hugh Jitsu that he just took whatever that focuses that got him so good at Jujitsu and applied it to striking. And now he's, he's just a winner. He knows how to win. You know what I mean? He knows how to put shit together when he landed that upper con Frankie and I was like, Jesus vicious frank. He's a hard guy to fucking hit clean in Paul's. Yeah, gray Maynard.

Speaker 2:          00:45:36       Yeah, it's a fucking nightmare. Well, even gray Maynard, he came back and won that fight. Which was insane. This is insane. Draw on the first fight. Chaos. I'm in the second fight. Those fights were fucking chaos, man. Some of the best, but the fact that Ortega took him out and meet some people say, well maybe Frankie's at the end of his rope he's in, you know he's in as deep into his thirties now. What is he? 36 something like that, right? 36 34 either way though. It's Frankie Edgar. Either way. It's Frankie Edgar. Yeah, and then he went on to beat Cub Swanson one four weeks later or some shit. I was like, no, I'll do that. New Jersey. Yeah, 36 yeah, just phenomenal conditioning dude. And then also on this card he got DC fucking steepy too. To me it's like the first real, like when the super fight here, to me this is like the first real, real super fight like GSP Bisping.

Speaker 2:          00:46:20       I was like, that's cool. That's a thick ass GSP. I guess that's Super Fun. But DC, Steve Bay's a fucking real super fight. That's a real super fight. I love it, man. You know what? I'm looking to almost lose four to almost as much of Francis black beast. That's right son Derek Lewis, Frances and Ghana. Woo. I know everyone thinks of me a first round knockout in there. Just going to throw caution to the wind. I think Derrick Lewis double legs him either in the first round or second round and beats them, uh, via Tko. Really? Yeah. Damn. How good is d Derek's wrestling? I mean, he's the explosive dude and you play football. You know, I, I, I, I think people are making mistake going. Oh Derek, just going to go on there. Francisco, go in the fucking plant. Their feet and just fucking chuck the bombs. I think you're wrong, man.

Speaker 2:          00:47:06       I think you're, I think people think that are wrong. I think Derek's going to mix it up if he's smart. I just, I think what I would do if I was them in what Derek in his background and Francis working on stuff, I think Derek's going to shoot the crowd. The crowd's going to bu, but Derek's going to shoot and then his grandma house little boot. It's a good crowd crowd that understands the danger of Francis on his back. Derek on top. Derek with big Kao Power Stop. Travis Browne. I bet they might be thinking, oh shit, this is going to get crazy hopefully cause it's not like if Derek takes you down, he's just going to hold on to you. There's going to try to get, you know you can punch you. It's going to try to kill. You can face that Travis Browne key Tko or a [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          00:47:46       It's one of the worst ones. Bisbing route Dan Hendo and then that one for me it's like you don't want to see that replay and that was a rough one. That was a tough one. And gather new man. You got to get to him first. The thing about getting to him was you're running into hammers. You've got to get to him, got to get to your rotors. Just got to kind of stay back and then the cardio gets still. We only saw him tired once, but it was a big one. You don't see them out of the first round ones, right? Yeah. Steve Bay figured it out. He just, he does also steep bay. Like we're good. I get friends, a lot of shit. But that fucking CPA, he's the most calm, you know, accomplish heavyweight of all time. Yeah. I mean you have to look at him, his accomplishments.

Speaker 2:          00:48:24       You look at the guys that he stopped and the guys, he defended his title like Great Stop Fabricio wins the title stops. Ouster stops junior dos Santos. I mean the only reason why Steven doesn't get enough credit as he should is because all these guys are a step past their prime. Right? Like to me, yeah. And I love Stevie. To me, what's more impressive when Cain beat Jds, that was prime jds. Who was the motherfucker? Motherfucking Cain put his fucking head right in the middle of his chest and did work after getting knocked out in the first round. [inaudible] fight in MMA history was insane. Insane, insane. Like that. That to me, that's a little more impressive than what, when, what? When Steve Bay beach jds cause the jets JBS after an ass whooping by Kane rounds. It is impressive. 10 of an ass whooping, but it's almost as impressive as surviving that first round against Francis.

Speaker 2:          00:49:19       I don't know who would have agreed. There's not a lot of guys that would've survived that round the waist. Deep Bay did DC, DC, man, I wonder. He ate that fucking pumped from Anthony Romero. John, talk about that kid. Pop the fuck back up. Yeah. Oh God. Yeah. Jesus Christ. But John Kay Odom. Yeah, it's Jon Jones. Jon Jones beat everyone we're talking about, but maybe she, the thing about Francis, I'm very curious to see what it looks like you no, no, not on what I'm saying. I'm very curious to see what he looks like in this next fight, but we're going to find a lot about whether or not he's able to correct mistakes, whether his conditioning is just one of those things with all that fast twitch muscle fiber, whether he's not going to be able to go five rounds hard, I don't think he's going to turn into fucking Nate Diaz or something like that.

Speaker 2:          00:50:00       I, I think it might be a tad better. The way you get better is not using all his energy on power punches like so maybe it's more of a experience thing. But with Derek Lewis, he also pedal to the metal and hits hard as fuck too. He does and he's been, you know, he's been in some serious trouble that Travis Brown fight. Like he was in serious fucking trouble, man. Yeah, he's a, he's a warrior for sure. I mean that guy has been in some crazy ass fucking fights. Crazy fights. He's dangerous. Both are super dangerous and he wants that fight to Derrick Lewis has asked him for that advice. They both won that fight. This is going to be crazy. Super Crazy. I think the craziest thing on the card to me is how many people are riding off DC? He's the underdog against Ebay. Yeah, I have DCB Noman to you.

Speaker 2:          00:50:48       Yeah. I know you hate pigs, but when I, when I break down the fight I look at what that's terrible picture makes the bail like super small fucking DCL giant small STP looks DC looks like he's like a fucking gigantic. It looks like Brock Lesnar's do you? It looks like. And what are they doing? It looks like a Bantam weight. It's all there. Yeah. One. So 76 inches. I want to 71 inches. None of that bothers me man. Like the reach the height because DC's dealt with as entire career Gustafson. Jon Jones looked, guys had even bigger reaches. I think also one thing to take into consideration, Steve Bay doesn't throw a lot of kicks. He's not a big kicker being goes, yeah, he's more of a boxer and um, you know, he's DC's also going to be able to get under him easier than any guys ever fought before.

Speaker 2:          00:51:32       I mean, dcs flit five 11 to about five alone if that. Yeah. You know, he's getting, and he fucking, he has top of the food chain wrestling man. Remember when he did the Henderson to Barnard that launched in the air, launched them in the air. Fucking slammed them to Barnett. Big Fella. Yeah. And Kim grapple is fucking and grapples fucking ass off in DC. Took him for a ride sign. But the Henderson fight was the most impressive to me because Henderson, even though he's smaller than DC, he's a fucking stud and he was an Olympic silver medalist himself and DC, just rag doll dim. See? And people go, I see some people discredit DC a little bit when they go, when he won the Grand Prix in strike force, that was a different time. Those heavyweights are older and you know the, the games evolve while it gets deep AI.

Speaker 2:          00:52:17       I'm like, heavyweights haven't really evolved that much, man. You don't see a guy throwing a lot of kicks and mixing up wrestling and Jujitsu. Like you look at Steve Bay's game, it's boxing or wrestling, you know, that's very similar to what dcs used to beating. So the times when he's in trouble, this guy like Jon Jones who fucking mix up and he's a fucking nightmare. But when you're just, when you're John bought all, that's what I'm saying. When DC goes in a fight and you're just boxing or wrestling, dcs is the reason why DC is going to go down as one of the grapes all the time is his mental game. Bro. You. So fuck is he's fucking fight Iq is crazy. Yeah. He's tough as shit. And you know the, like if you look who else does it the way John does, where they're, they're really good at everything.

Speaker 2:          00:53:01       They win by submission. They win by knockout, they win by, you know, my emails, you'd have to go, you have to go to a lighter weight. Those are the two, right? Because even Cain, Cain with do moy Tai and came would for sure wrestle and ground and pound. But he never really submitted anybody. No. Kingston was wrestling and smashing out windows. Yeah. Outwork you, get you to get you exhausted to the point you didn't, you never even believed you could be there. Embrace the grind. Which DC has been trained with Cain for out of this fight. Yeah. And who is came back now. Is he a hundred percent training? Yeah, he's helping him. Wow. So, so when I look at that, I go up a cane styles, almost identical to fucking Steve Bay's, but Steve has a little more power as far as cardio, wrestling kings better at those things, man.

Speaker 2:          00:53:47       Well, Cain was better than anybody that ever lived for like two years. There was there. Yeah, there was a moment. I mean, and he just got injured so many times. There was so many injuries with him, but like when you look at what he was able to do with real fucking tough guys, just break them down. Deal tough guys. But you know, he's had shoulder surgery, back surgery, knee surgery. I mean after a while everything was just given out because of the force of his will and his workouts are so fucking tough. Those guys at Aka, you know like Dana was giving them a hard time at one point in time saying something about, you know that they, they're always getting hurt but they win. That's how you get killers. Like cane to get a guy that's got that kind of mind. He's used to being in that horrible misery of trying to break someone.

Speaker 2:          00:54:36       He's used to. It does it all the time. They all do it all the time. And then DC went all go there and train and remarried DC before he went there. He trained with us in Denver. He didn't, he wasn't that good, you know, loves his wrestling was ridiculous. But he moved there and then he just followed suit. They got John Fitch, he unconscious checked yet fucking can be got beep hold. Yeah man. When Rockwell gets people on the ground, smashes him. When he got Weidman on the ground, widen was stuck under a building. Two, same thing with Leo Machida. You look at him and he'd go, Oh, branch branch, same belt gets you down. And His fucking top game is just murderous. He's because of who he's training with. He's training with those guys. I have friends who were watching them train down in Florida and they were just saying, is his Jujitsu heal?

Speaker 2:          00:55:21       They wouldn't give me names. They said worldclass shoes guys. He's fucking up rolling. Like just destroying. No, he's a nightmare. As a freak athlete. He's strong and he's long. He's got like long leverage. But he's also got physical strength. He was supposed to by Dustin until he hurt his leg. We'll have those official, uh, he got a huge gash in it. He had staples. I think he posted it looks fucking terrible. That would be an interesting Justin Kahn. Close to mirror. No time. No time son. So you think Steve Pay and DC goes to DC by decision? Yep. Thank you out wrestles him. I just think he out works them I think yet [inaudible] I don't think it's a classic fight. I just think hopefully more people appreciate DC after this. I looked at both of them. They both have to embrace the grind thing as as and as long as DC can avoid that big power punch early on he's going to be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:56:08       And he's so smart man. Well I definitely think he's really smart but I also think that steep a is a really good striker and he's a bigger guy and he's got a long reach and he's probably one of the best heavyweight strikers that dcs ever fought. He's got real one punch knockout power at heavyweight. He throws clean shots. He doesn't have any fat and its punches. He'll stand here like this and drop one in onto he credits his best shot. He's got a chin. He's tough as fuck. He loves being champion. You know, he might, he might have a lot to prove here. And you know, he doesn't throw a lot of kicks, but it doesn't mean he can't, he can throw him if he wants to, if he thinks that's part of the strategy and he wants to throw head kicks. I mean he would be cool to see.

Speaker 2:          00:56:48       I don't see him kick. I have, he can kick. You can kick. It does. It's the difference between kicking in practice. I'm pulling off against a worldclass. That's true. I like DC. Big Guy too. Man Sees Man. And that's where John, that's why John Jones goes, I'm gonna knock them out by head kick. Cause if you look at the video DC's here, he's, if he's down there, man, he's susceptible to it. So that's what it sees it. But did John fake a right hand and then throw that left high kick? He was setting up, he was thrown to the body. Thrown the Mati yeah. And then threw it out. And then you see d say go over and then there's whack. Yeah. I want to see if you could find that clip of John Jones. Kaylene DC hurt is powerful. Jamie. Oh Man. Just landed it. Perfect. Let me say that one more time. Yeah. You know what to about the, let's go back. Go back. Sorry. Go back to the beginning. Watch this. Fuck this. Only have to do that. That was beautiful. The way he did that. That was, I hope John comes back. It was beautiful. There was like no fat in that at all, man. It was beautiful. So amazing. Boom. Thank you. All good. DC is, and for him to do that, amazing, ridiculous smashed him. Dude, look at this.

Speaker 2:          00:57:57       So ridiculous. Damn. It took a couple extra shots there that he didn't need to take. Well, there's a lot of down there and now they're even going back at it on Twitter. But John Jones here, here, here's the perfect case scenario. If you're, you know, if you're scrooge McDuck and you're sitting down and you're looking at the UFC roadmap roadmap, you're like, we love Steve Bay. He's been a great champion. But if he could plan it like you're fucking Vince Mcmahon and WWE, you want DC to win. And then John to come back and at heavyweight you have DC John Jones fight for a world title heavyweight and they have Brock gone. I got next wait in the back on I got next kick, kick kick you off. Ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, ratings, golden snitch. Take a hike. I like it. Let's let that sink in. Another one is would have John suspension lasts longer than we think.

Speaker 2:          00:58:47       We don't even, we're assuming that John's going to get a suspension then he's going to be able to come back fairly soon. Don't be the no fun police. Well what if Brock comes in and Brock fights the winner of DC and Steve Bay? Let's just say DC wins. I'll take it. Okay. And DC. DC could beat Brock. That's an instinct. Fight. DC versus Broxton. Interesting fight. Great fight. Bronx got hands as big as this table. He's fucking any Ken Russell's ass his ass off. The question is, cause he can he do it clean at his age because he took like 12 different tests. Clean talk, role clean. We'll figure it out.

Speaker 3:          00:59:22       Just like the last one. I think the UFC wants to make that paper. You got to tell you Cyrus scram for like dinner. One, five k to go grab a cup of coffee. It's broken. John, go grab a fucking cup of coffee. No one's going to ever let that happen. This is what we're talking trash. This is nonsense talk. You're crazy. If you think you signed as all clean, like the US government, what are you saying? First of all, you think the US government is clean. I'll call Eddie Bravo. Right? That's what I'm saying. On his way. That's what I'm saying. You saw it as like the government son. Everything ain't fucking done by the books. If I'm Dana, I'm like, you open up your glove compartment bucks. Yeah, man. Keep that came greasy mouth shut. Keep agrees with these boys. Come over and punch each other in the face. Go fuck up our ESPN deal. Wow. And who wouldn't want to see that? Yeah, maybe. Yes. Pam pulls him aside. Take them into some smokey room. Sit down there with some Cuban cigars. It's like, what am I doing here? Fine whiskey. How long is their deal with Usada? Do we know? Do we have any idea? I don't know there cause he had signed a contract. I don't know. I bet there's a count down at Dana's office just every day. 365 days. 64 days.

Speaker 3:          01:00:38       The whole thing is kind of crazy that it's self imposed, right Cody doing man. Well it was a great, it was a, it's a great move to cell to cell. Yeah. There's the move for tea is so genius monster. Lorenzo's a god damn genius. He figured it out and you know, now he gets to just be a fan with 4 billion in the bank. You what? What he's like, yeah, I know you have to smash a few eggs to make an Omelette man. But he, it's a great success story because those guys were down 40 plus million dollars in the hole when I yeah, when the ultimate fighter took off, they had spent, they'd lost 40 million. What does that to them though? It's enough. Forties 40 but still when you're not, when you're, if you lost, you lost a couple hundred grand, you would survive. But you'd be like, Shit, pissed for sure.

Speaker 3:          01:01:26       He'd be like, fuck, this is not good. It takes a long time to make that much. Especially when I get to my boy to run and it was fucking up. You know what I'm saying? Exactly. Two $40 million is $40 million. I'll give a five. I agree. You all I'm appealing and I'll be like, I don't want that money going away. Going home. Get my dick sucked. You know what I'm saying? Like I'm like, God, that sucks. Anyway, let me walk in my giant mansion. You got to think of how many different businesses that are run at the same time though. They had like 20 casinos, 20 plus casinos. The stations. They had a green valley ranch. Yep. They still red rocks. Rocks is dope. Dope. Dope. They just bought out palms too. Oh Yeah, a little rundown, but whatever. The nine though, that steakhouse there. Oh, that's one of the best steakhouses in Vegas and they goes by nominal goes probably should be dope.

Speaker 3:          01:02:13       That's old school. I used to stand up there. We've done stands up, goes parts. This is like one of the bars there. One of the bars downstairs. There's, there's a laugh factory in Vegas right there is now. Yeah. I'm trying to bring it back dices there all the time. I think it's in the Tropicana. Does that make sense? The laugh factor in the Trump camp and that uh, the comedy cellar? Yeah, that's in the Rio. The comedy cellar is supposed to be really good. Who, who, who's running that though? Sown sown. We know is running that. I thought the comedy cellar, I don't know. Um, Ian's there a lot though. Ian Edwards. Do what? He says it's great. Pages to me is always a weird vibe. Obviously you're there during UFC fight. We can do your huge fucking stadiums. But I'm saying as far as the crowds, usually if it's not a UFC crowd, yeah, it's a different thing.

Speaker 3:          01:02:57       Well, there's so many things to do. First of all, right? Or you can be a Celine Dion. I could be on ecstasy right now. Why am I here? Listen to you talk. I do want the blue man fucking roll in my ass off. Why am I here? There's so many things to do, like, uh, have you, have you ever been to one of those sorts of soul lies? Sure. Have you been to love the one at the MGM? No, but I've been Zumanity with a friend and some drugs and it's one of the best times ever. Uh, how about when Disney uses those robot flipper things to do with Cirque du Soleil? How crazy was that? I posted this online. I saw this, uh, this, this article about Disney's making acrobatic robots do these robots flip through the air and land and jump into holes and shit in the middle of the Goddamn Park.

Speaker 3:          01:03:45       These robots that Disney's making their animatronic robots. But here's what's fucked up about it. What's to stop someone from using these and making like a super warrior with the same technology. This is all under the guise that Disney, these motherfuckers, I know what they're doing. So look at these things, dude, that's a robot. That's a robot. So look at this. Look at it. Swing and look at it. Let go and Tuck. Hurfeish jumped into a whole. Yeah, dude, that's going to be a killer robot that we send overseas to fight battles. So look, get that thing fly through the air and boom. This is nuts, man. I mean, this is really insane stuff. What the fuck they doing with this? They're going to have this. I like the Pixar parade or some shift for all the kids. I think they're going to do this for movies, for Shit like that so that you don't have to risk up, man.

Speaker 3:          01:04:29       See Ya, dude. That is so stoked, man. Oh my God. That's Tait Fletcher. Tate's acting. He'll slide in. He'll be able to make it. He's still going to be a character, actually. True. Yeah. He doesn't talk to too, but CGI a face on that ces, right? Paint that Disney Pixar is painting faces on there tonight. If you gonna need people for Voices, half of that movie, Logan, the Wolverine movie that he wasn't there. There's a video you can see where they show you how they CGI to everything. He wasn't really there for half of it or they act. They did it. Very strange. That movie's depressing anyway. If you're a Wolverine Fan. I was like, God Damn Bro. It's driving home limo and shit. Oh, is that what he's doing after it's over? He's like a limo and fucking Xavier. Professor x is like in some weird fucking hut dying.

Speaker 3:          01:05:14       It's hot out. It'll bump me out, bro. Don't watch it. I'm not saying that movie the wrestler. That's terrible. Yeah, it's a bumps you out. Depressing. Excellent. First class all the way anyways. Yeah. Vegas is weird as what we're getting at in Disney's trying to take over the world. The Disney is about to work with Darpa. That's what's going on. Sign. That's Boston dynamics or whatever it is. What's the company? Yeah, Boston Dynamics. Disney does everything better than everyone. He's not doing that. This show that all breaks down. This is all a robot. It wasn't even, it was just a stunt double guy. What fucking haters. Double Guy does this and then they put him on top of that. What? So him being a, Oh, look at that. They just have this space. See if you can make a robot do all that stuff, then you could easily just put his face on there and Whoa, Hugh Jackman got Super Jack Bro.

Speaker 3:          01:06:05       He's on that beat tour diet. He got so swollen but he doesn't look like that anymore. Like in this one. No, it wasn't the tool. America's greatest showman. You can't be all jacked seeing niche. Right. So they just mapped out his face. But the thing is like if you see him in this one, he doesn't look as jacked as he did. And like the earlier ones, he's older, he's old marine, which is sort of supposed to be right. If his body can recuperate from anything when the flux, the aging. Exactly. Come on. Why is he aging like that? Come on where he's losing some of his muscle, but he's still throwing people through the air like they're attack. He gets shot, recovers right away. But his fucking joints hurt his arthritis. What's happening to the arthritis? No, no. You really moved like it these days.

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       I don't know if he officially does. I'm just saying it doesn't make sense. How about to come out with another fucking Spiderman. Oh, thank God they need a new spider man. They never want to pay Peter Parker. When Peter Parker's starts getting big, they'd go, yeah, well guess what? We're going to reboot it. I just keep playing coating it. They keep telling the same story over and over again with subtle differences. My Spiderman Tobey Maguire. You fuck you. Fuck [inaudible] Scott Chick rocks. I'll tell you what though. The only time that that's worked though the hulk. Yeah, they've done that. They started off with that Australian dude from chopper. What's his name? Uh, Eric Bana. Eric Bana. He was number one, wasn't thrilled about him as the hall, not his fault. It wasn't his fault. It wasn't the best match script. And then Ed Norton pretty good as a hulk fan of ed noise. I was like, okay, I could buy this.

Speaker 3:          01:07:32       But then Mark Ruffalo Best Hawk best talk, I believe in me too, I believe he's really assigned to, is to really believe he really understands genetics. You know like Christian Bale's the best Batman you're talking about. Relax. I agree. Sorry, Ben Affleck. I agree. How about Michael Keaton was Batman. Who the fuck a good God. Damn. Batman hygienic cast. Michael come up this George Clooney's Batman too. He's a fucking Mr. Steal your girl. I bought George Clooney. I brought did you? I didn't buy it for the second call when Jim Carrey was the Riddler and then Tommy Lee Joint Jones was to phase. Those are the best Batman's when they were like, oh, we need to make this more real. I'm like, fuck you. I liked Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze. Wait a minute. Who was the Riddler? Jim Carrey was a Riddler when? Who Was Batman? Uh, George cloney. No Batman returns. Broan wow. But Christian Bale's Batman forever. Sorry. Christian Bale is a better bet.

Speaker 3:          01:08:24       It's too real. Do you know Christian Bale was Batman only like six months after he was the machinist. That's insane. Really insane. Down to like almost nothing. He was dying. He was eating like a can of tuna and an apple a day. That's insane. Willpower. You have to have to let your body literally rot away to this skinny thing for a movie. Just for a movie. You don't have anorexia. You don't have a disease. How much you love the craft of act and to do that. Yeah, man. Everybody trying to be the joke or these days though. That's like the big one. Tony Hinchcliffe. He's trying to be wet. Excuse me. Tony. Tony wants to be the joker. Yeah, look. So look, he went from that to that one 21 to one 95. That's all natural. Insane. There was another movie in between, I think otherwise. Yeah. Equilibrium. It said there's no picture here.

Speaker 3:          01:09:12       You're telling me that's not photo shopped at all on the left. No, no, no. That's what it really looked like. That is so unhealthy. Oh Dude. It takes years off your life. I mean, you're putting unbelievable stress. He's under Oregon's, he's a beast. He's English. You know that. I thought he was Australian, Izzy. He thinks so. I thought there was an Australian English bro. A lot of them are Australian. They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll throw you for a loop. Jack. Chris Hemsworth, but Jackman like as an actor, like Christian Bale. He does some stuff. Wolverine. Now look, I'm a fan. Don't get me wrong. Um, but Christian bale does some stuff like in American psycho. Okay. That's another one. When he was in the fighter, when he, when he played a Micky ward's brother. Oh my God. Dude. Up and down the whole time when 85, one 21, one 91 35, one 91 45 him and reign of fire, he is bodied the fuck up.

Speaker 3:          01:10:07       So he got down skinny again to play a Micky ward's brother. Meth addict. Yeah. Yeah. I forgot making boards, brother. But his brother fought sugar ray Leonard. Yeah. In between two rescue don. I don't know. I never saw that one fucking and bs. That dragon movies. Dope for one of them silly dumb movies. Which Dragon Movies in a dragon movie was the dragon movie he was in, wasn't the, in a dragon movie with Matthew mcconaughey. If it was uh, it was in the future. Yeah. That everybody has to do underground drugs. I did them all. They had to live a fire. Oh, reign of fire. Yeah. Yeah. That's the drag. That's a reign of fire. There's a dragon movie. Yeah. Matchup of Khan Hayes jacked in that movie. Oh, super jacked to see. He got Super Skinny for Dallas buyers club when he had aids. Yeah, he did it too. He's another one. Yes.

And you know, dude, remember how bad he used to hate on dragons. Do I watch game of Thrones town on all you guys for watching? I watch game of Thrones, Dragon Burns. Spoiler you fuck's been out for nine years. He Burns that fucking frozen wall. I'm talking about standing ovation. I was in the middle of my living room. Slow clap.

I, everybody who works on that show, listen to me, don't ever cancel it. Just keep going. It's just, you never going to do anything better than that. Oh, that's the greatest show of all time. I know.

Speaker 2:          01:11:59       I don't know what you're thinking. Just write some new episodes. Figure out some new shit. It's the greatest show of all. They just rap. No, they rep. No, there'll be back. God Damn. Look at that. Miss Jam. I'm mechanic jacked Jack Cheese.

Right above that, right above your cursor. Right there. Right there on different, Oh, who's that? That's Bradley Cooper. Cooper body dumped to him son. Look at him, but wouldn't you get do all of the steroids to play these roles? I think they call me to be Batman. I'd like, yeah. Yeah. All right. Let me go down at Gold's gym. See what I can do. Yeah. You would have to.

Speaker 2:          01:12:37       You'd have to, you'd have to go on the carnivore diet. Drop your body fat down. I wouldn't you though. Intermittent fasting. Just the whole cryo every day. Yeah. You'd be training camp. Get shredded training camp. You would want to have that scene where you're putting on your fucking outfit and you're just talking like we need more scenes. Where at mom's short list. Just town downtown bullshit. Oh, Ryan Reynolds. Ryan ramp. Is that Ryan running blade blade blade three. That's Ryan Reynolds and Blake three blue. Who is that guy sees another guy that's, oh no, that's next level. See if that's what you gotta try for. That's what you gotta try it for. No one ever tries to that. Do chicks don't take that though. Other dude's Dick fucking mouth. We take that shy girls are like, no, I don't like they say that because they're trying to make you feel better.

Speaker 2:          01:13:22       Oh my God. I think it's so gross. I like geysers soft like you. I like to grab your back and fill out fat. Okay. Brian federals with this fuck no bro. Pack. Oh my God. No Way. I mean, I definitely don't bond his dick in my mouth. A little belly fat on my nose. Full rack of ribs. No fuck in the shake once you're done with this shit like a man. He was just a real lax like me and doesn't want to deal much. That's what I like. Please do. They're trying to make you feel good. We'll try to make you feel good. I'm pretty good saying, I'm not saying you are fat. Were both fat compared to that guy, dude. Both of us are fucking Adele compared to that guy. I'm saying that's unrealistic. Like dope. Like that's too much. Someone has body image issues, girls to get planes about chicks with little waist and big tits.

Speaker 2:          01:14:11       Oh my God. I have body and it shows. I appreciate it man. More than people think I'm gay. I appreciate you have any body image issues because of these women that are unattainable. They have these unobtainable bodies and it's filled up. You're putting a standard on women that's not real. Yeah. Yeah. I have that framed. One sweat. I had a friend once who said this, she was, she was uh, talking about someone's girlfriend. She's like, Oh, I just wish he had a real girlfriend or like a real, a real woman. I go, what are you talking about? And she's like, oh look, look who he's dating is typical pretty girl with blonde hair and a nice body. Like what? You know, why doesn't he have a real girlfriend? I go put heats up the fuck I'm, and it's so crazy. People are real people. Like everyone's really, you're, you're hating on someone because they're a trust not you.

Speaker 2:          01:14:51       Yeah. Yeah. I come. Why would you assume that she's not super nice and really friendly and really smart? Cause you're prejudice because you just looking at her and deciding that you're hating it. She had dumb ass probably. But does that matter? You know what I'm saying? It does not matter. It's all right. You might not be as smart as you. How much is that? How much of that is her fault? I've, this is as I've gotten older and wiser when even when I meet dumb people, I'm like, how much of it is really their fault? Maybe they're just not into that stuff. Maybe they just got a bad roll of the dice with life and with genetics and the whole ball on top. Sometimes a bad roll the dice is you're genetically gifted. If you're a girl or a guy and you look super pretty and things come easy to you.

Speaker 2:          01:15:29       You never had to read a book or get balls deep into a sport or something like that. And that's, to me, that can be a curse. Yeah, dude, there's a curse to that because then things get easy like you want, you want your daughters, you don't want to be tense. You want, I'm like sevens strong, seven strong seven where like guys like didn't like, there's certain guys types, they still got to educate themselves. You know, like you don't want to blot asses and big titties. You want him to just like, you know, you know what I'm saying? Oh yeah, for sure. You don't want Nikki Minaj is your daughter in that 10 to tens of sprint seven is a ultra marathon. Yeah. To me, seven to have a long day. A seven for many, many, many years. Especially like h and r block go to the gym. They can hang in there, but they gotta work for it.

Speaker 2:          01:16:13       Like you don't want to just give it to them. You know what I'm saying? The problem with some tens that go to eights can't handle it. Even when they're eight they're still hot, but in their mind, but in their mind they're not anymore and they get real freaked. Rosa, no test to Testarossa. It was hot in the eighties so long this, that's when they had the gated shifter. Yes. You drive one down. You're like, what the fuck is going on? Oh, stupid Fred Flintstone could get on until I have to get out and do this now let me one of the worth like $1 million or something just to try and bind one. Yeah. Did you? I wanted one. I'd go on these weird fucking, I almost bought a Delorean the other day. I knew a lady who had an old Ferrari. She bought an old Ferrari in like 2015 she bought like one that was the one from Magnum Pi.

Speaker 2:          01:16:58       Oh, the three 64 is that what it is? I think so. Is this cool little car, but it was always breaking those things. They're just not gonna. It's not, you can't drive across country in that car. No. You don't have somebody who's in driver every year. Yeah, that'd be fun though. I'd like to have a bunch of cars. I would like to have a bunch of cars to half a bunch of Co. Yeah. Don't jump into this company. I'm still hustling. Don't try like, Hey, don't try to the dude. You're fucking Hudson your ass. I'll put you out of all the clothes. I don't have all the cars. You know what I've been getting into man, old plain looking BMW m threes like an e 46 Mre. Wow. All right. I'm down for that. You'd get an eight series. Would that be 12 maybe, but I'm talking about what holds cars.

Speaker 2:          01:17:42       I'm talking about like a 2005 me to have that eight series. I'm talking like 1994 but those are for 12 that's when the lights go up has been sick. That's where I draw the line. When the lights go up, can't do it son. Testarossa of the BMW you like deal with the the 95 three series. Kim, that Canary Yellow. I did. I did like those. I like the ones with the big weighing in the back of the m three with the wing on the back. Tiny ass little car too, man. You go near those cars today. They don't make anything that small anymore or not know. BMW doesn't at least look at that. Those white lights on the side. So that's a dope look. And that's an [inaudible] 86 right? That's an e 36 BMW. Yeah. Yeah. Google a silver. He 46 BMW. You're thinking about getting one of those.

Speaker 2:          01:18:27       I'm thinking I don't have all the cars. I know, right? Well that's because valley guess. Yeah. Are you going to buy it to run into, look at, look at that. I like that. You know what I like about that? That's not that. That's on 95 yes, it's 2005 what I like about that. Yeah, that's not 2005 [inaudible] 46 back stiff. Yeah. No, not supposed to. What they look like? That's an m three that's exactly it looks like I'm a fan of the model. It's a very plain looking car. You just, so you know what some people do with those? They just juice the shit out of the engine and change the suspension. And the thing about it, it's a light small car that like moves. Well, I think that car probably only weighs about 3000 pounds. Like Google. How much does a 2005 BMW m three were?

Speaker 2:          01:19:11       Those portions are layered as fuck too though, man. Uh, just Google. How much does it weigh? Was the weight. I mean, we could go buy 10 of these right now, Joe. No, no, no. The two, 3,400 pounds. So that's a pretty light in comparison to like a new one. I bet the new ones are three or 400 pounds heavier than that. That's a big deal. The new ones are way fast wave and way too fast. Way Too fast. Way Cooler. The spiral. They take these and they put crazy engines and oh they belonged. Juice them up because it's a smaller car. That's one of the original like cars. I remember kids just fucking Jack and the big exhaust on you buy the shirts. Do you ever see a kid who just spent so much money on a really shitty accord and puts Chris Civic and we grow just as they sell it at pepboys? Doesn't mean you have to put it on the Goddamn car. Why do you have all that shit all over the car? What are you doing and why? And it was so loud. I'm like, Kirsten, even fast. It's [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          01:20:09       I have that horrible four cylinders are all fucking nuts. Those kids thought they were so cool. Well I guess it's cooler than the car as it is. No, probably not even cause what it is is just transportation. It's supposed to just accept what it is. It's peacocking like, like look at this again. You're not doing it for girls. He draw up for dudes. Other dudes like, oh, that's pretty cool. Girls got, what the fuck is that thing? Yeah. Look at that Honda Civic. It makes my dick go limp like that. Like a civic. They can make those things fairly fast though. Campaign. Yeah. I do start into the Sii ones you're talking about. Yeah. What does that Ford Focus Gt? Is that that little tiny car go fast as fuck. Yeah. That's a tiny little concert like that though. You want that Subaru WRX STI. The Ford F. Yeah. How much does that thing way though? That's a tiny little car, right? That thing looks like shit.

Speaker 4:          01:21:03       [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          01:21:09       does. It does. 3,200 pounds is a tiny little car, bro. Dude, you brought up 95 BMW's Ford focuses and civics. Well, you know man, you know I have that white car though. The white nine 11 rs. Fuck that car three ruins me for everything else because it's so light. They're crawling away is 3000 pounds. That thing's insane. Ruined me for everything else. Nothing else fun to drive. Everything's fun. I love car. Didn't, that thing is just a different animal. It's like the difference between like a dog in a Cheetah, like one of them was like dogs run pretty good, they do a pretty good job, but then you get cheated and you're like, Jesus, what? But what if you got him a dog? What if? Yeah, it's a weird, but what if he got a nine 11 t how lights at nine 11 t and then soup the Senate to shark where it's just a blow they ass out the front.

Speaker 3:          01:22:00       Oh one of the new ones. You mean the things light? It's fuck, they're very light. Yeah. The nine 11 teaser. Yeah. I'm sure they could do something like that because they don't even have, you know, they don't have handled, they have nothing there. No backseats. They're super light. Yeah, they, what did they get them down to? I forget, but is it gt three weights there? I want to say they're lighter, aren't they? Gt three touring package gt three without the crazy wing and it just cause which most of the people are not taking them on a track. You just driving a fast car around town 35 I can't have that thing. So the GT 200 is this the GT three or this? The uh, the t 3,200 that's pretty God damn light for a Porsche. Yeah. Zero to 63.4 seconds. Yeah, but you can soup that fucking thing up. Yeah. I wonder what is the a horsepower, what does it say?

Speaker 4:          01:22:46       Okay.

Speaker 3:          01:22:47       See the, what they're doing with, yeah, that's a three 70 and that's not even the s engine. No mass. The regular engine. The salts turbo. Now though, go to nine 11 gt three touring. I bet that's just as light. But that's got like 500 horsepower. That's my next ride. Either want that on glare. Glaring man. But you have that gts,

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       which is a very fast car too. There was a, it's fucking great. [inaudible] there was a big article about one of those recently. I know people, they say it's that one of the best like daily drivers, Porsche. How that's 3,100 pounds son [inaudible] 500 500 horsepower, 3,100 pounds. That thing must be amazed. This is what I want to do. Only get a torn, I want to order and I want in that mint green, they've got pretty, that is, they just nailed that shape. You know? I love it if it's one of the more interesting things about cars is just the physical shapes, like what they've managed to like make iconic, like the Porsche is such an iconic shape. They don't need to do anything. They'll do little subtle changes to the back and the exhaust. That doesn't bother me. Yeah, they just keep kind of tweaking it a little bit.

Speaker 2:          01:23:49       They keep that shape like every nine 11 looks like a nine 11 like if you look at a 2019 Mustang and then you look at it in 1965 Mustang talk, how do I know this is the same thing. I know could barely tell this is the same thing, but you could have a nine 11 next to like you'd have that that nine six four that's like a 91 next to a 2019 and you'd go, I see. They're both fine. Eleven's 100% yeah. That's the only car that I can think of like that because old Ferrari's don't look like new Ferrari's at all. Not at all. I guess the new challenges looked like a little bit like the whole challenge. That tab. Yeah. They retroed it out a little bit. Minerals, they're trying to go back to it. Can we count Sky Camaro's did like a new take on it at the newest ones.

Speaker 2:          01:24:32       Even look at that Sun. Come on though. That is a gt three rs in all green. Seinfield gets like those and shit too. That's an amazing car, man. That's cars more than 500 horsepower. I think that things got five 20 and they're, they're so light and that just design track. You like that? You think you're a dick head for driving around town? Oh yeah, for sure. Why? Draymond green of a lime green card that says gt three Rs on it through Mike says gts and it's fucking hot orange. You should only wear a golf club. Shirts from exclusive golf club, golf clubs that no one could join. If you try that and then have those loafers on with no socks. Smell like audio, just beating the shit out. You should smell like a, what's that? What is it called when you might pass down money to your kids and they have one of those accounts were drugs found trust funds.

Speaker 2:          01:25:24       That's it. Smell. You could smell it and trust fund. That's a f. I'll tell you what, man. It's like all the handicaps you get in life when the biggest handicaps you get is a trust fund. There's something that happens to kids, at least secure. The ones that I've ever heard of, not just security, but a large income just given to them by their parents. I still have to work on it. Yes. You know, I read a statistic that it's like they're 400% more likely to die before they just 40 when they have that much money. Jesus, 4% 400% I know a couple people that have had one of those deals where they had one of those and did you like them? Now they fuss. They felt, I felt sad for them. No. I know. It felt like they were, they were. They weren't really done.

Speaker 2:          01:26:06       Like if you're an egg and you still got that gooey stuff on top, it's like it's not quite done. Rich kids are counting on inherence to pay for retirement will offer young people. Hold on. Where are you going? Well, if young people say they need money from relatives and friends to guarantee their golden years, stay gold. See that's just click baity system. Click Baity Shit. I just saw this article the other day. You guys just mentioned it as like 63% of them. Then the panel was 63% of affluent children between the ages of 18 and 22 say financial stability. Retirement would depend on inheriting money. You know, it's just, that's one of the things that Tim Kennedy said when he was on the podcast. He said, hard times make hard, man hard man. Make easy times, easy times. Make soft men and worst and Kennedy to preach.

Speaker 2:          01:26:53       What do you do? What do you do with your kids? Like my kids growing Marshall Armonica martial arts for the girls. You think going to be balls deep in martial arts? They're like in ninth grade. I, no, just to get, I think you, you got to get a certain amount of like actual hard work in, in your life or shorts going to do that for him. I think there's something to it, there's something to goal, uh, like valuing goals and, um, to working towards things and then being in difficult situations. We can help kids. Sports. Yes. Sports in general. Yes, for sure. I think all sports, but I think Marshall Marshall articular it's more personal. Like when someone's strangles you and somebody gets your back and then sinks that fucking body triangle on you and you're fighting off and then they get you and you have to tap.

Speaker 2:          01:27:35       That's very personal. You'll get humbled for sure. But most people don't deal with those kinds of things in life. I think the experience of dealing with those things in life is very valuable because you can relax more. They could relax more. You know, there's some people evidence. Yeah. Well, it's not just that you've experienced bad things, bad things in terms of like bad, uh, defeats losses, getting smooshed, having to tap. There's a lot of people that have never occur. Many times you have a role with the guy that never rowed before and the moment you start rolling with him, you get him on his back and they start hyperventilating, panicking. They panic because he never been there before. Professional football players, basketball players, I've rolled with them. They get down there like, oh shit, oh no. They realize they can't get up and then you start closing the gap on him.

Speaker 2:          01:28:17       Here's the problem with my only problem with Marshall active, if you're just going to go down that road is when you're in that Dojo where the fuck you're doing the martial arts, when they leave, they know that they're not. Many people have seen it, right? Like if you and I are rolling and we don't know each other, you tapped me out, I leave. They're not too many people see it the other, I see it when you're professional sports and we're playing basketball or football and the game's on the line and I get embarrassed cause I dropped the ball. Why? Whiffed and struck out in the entire audience sees it and I have to deal with that and then come back from it and be like, all right, I can deal with this man. I've, I'd fucking struck out. I play a game next week. Right. I got to go through class.

Speaker 2:          01:28:52       People are gonna make fun of me. I'll figure this out. To me that builds a little something different yet it's also teamwork. Right. That's a big part of life. Part of lives. Being able to work with other people. Yeah. Being able to perform under pressure but also facing that adversity and no one, cause if you tapped me out, Mike McMahon, when I go to school, no one knows that that's whatever. When I, when, when my class knows I threw an interception and like fuck shop threw that interception man. Monday. Everyone's like, dude, what happened? Like I know, I know. Wait Til Friday. We'll see. What happens Friday. Oh yeah. Um, Bill Buckner had to leave Boston. You have to go into like fucking, he had to go into hiding. The ball went between his legs. Everybody freaked out dude. I remember people walking around, dude, people were walking around the neighborhood while that was like try and find kicking the snow and angry.

Speaker 2:          01:29:39       They were just so angry. People were leaving their houses. It was like there was reports of it all over Boston that people just slant, they couldn't deal with it anymore because then they would just slammed the car, the the the front door rather and just walk out into the street be like, what the fuck? Just to tie out there smoking, looking at each other like how the fuck did he drop that ball? Dude, imagine you'd be that guy. Tragic. Look it. All of it is rough. I think sports are definitely great for, for kids, for anybody developing. Even for adults. I think they're good. I think competition is good. The problem with people is they, they, they, they get nervous about trying new things or doing things and I think one of the things that gets you over nerves is having done difficult chip before.

Speaker 2:          01:30:18       And one of the things about Jujitsu is that that's such a claustrophobic feeling. Like when you're, when you're locked up in a triangle and you're just trying to get like a hand in there to protect, you just just try and you're feeling the squeeze and you're like fuck, I might have to tap. And you try and you make your way out of it. That being able to do that in your life. Like knowing I've been in a bad spot before knowing I've been, someone's been on top of me before and I didn't think I'd get up. I think it's a very valuable thing for people to experience and I think it's a good thing for people to learn. Like, if you could start out as a white belt and just deal with that stuff that you get up until like blue belt and purple belt.

Speaker 2:          01:30:57       We start developing some skills and putting some tap sound up. If you can get through that man you can get through anything a guy can get to purple belt or a girl can get to black belt or brown belt. Those people, that man, that woman that can get that far, they can do a lot of shit. God Damn Bro. That a lot of people can't do for sure. For sure. For sure. I think giving your kids that opportunity is, is a a massive thing, you know and I know your kid's going to learn how to fight. How the fuck is [inaudible] you alright cause you know I watched a lot of fun so I came in the house whenever I want to get home today. Hope cause he sees all the fighters, boxers and UFC guys. They fight with their shirts off and I walk in, you just pop up, pop up pink shirt authors. I'll show you video of him hitting Mitts. I'm like, I don't know what to do. Get encourage him. Yeah. Time. The don't you tell him not, don't you don't have to fight son. He only does it kind of made good. Yeah. He only does it with me. Goddamn hit five. You're not getting hit in the head that he's toying dead. He's on the road rolling out. So, but like have you seen any Bravo's kid do martial arts to seen hunters?

Speaker 3:          01:32:00       I haven't. I'm going to focus on a teddy bear kind of just post. He's on a teddy bear doing like armbars teddy bear and he's a, you know Eddie does drills with his kid. He posts videos of drills he does with his kid. His kid has no learning the system. I think that's good. Fuck yeah, his kid's going to be an assassin. You know what kind of Jiu Jitsu Eddie Bravo's kids going to have? Pretty gnarly because he's around this kid all the time. Like Eddie is a diligent father. He loves that about dad. He [inaudible] get some mount this shit ghetto. That is hilarious. He takes the back look at that. He's like two and a half on this. That is hilarious. This kid is taking the back at two and a half. That is so funny. This is hilarious. The best teacher in the world. Of course.

Speaker 3:          01:32:43       Yeah. That's amazed on explains about it. And I think Ken or two, this is like his biggest pupil in terms of a Jujitsu. I mean obviously Ronda Rousey was his most famous pupil that aren't by that. Kids got that. Rhonda had an arm bar before she got there. She did exactly. But Brian or take as everything, he's got everything he can choke. You could take your back and you fight you off his back. Brian came in there and didn't know anything. Yeah, it was a tough gang member. Want to be? Well, I shouldn't say wannabe was a tough gang yet from the streets. Couldn't afford it. So a Henna took him under his wing. That's amazing. And now he's one of the, you know, he's number one. That's a middleweight in the world, not named Max Holloway. That's amazing. Yeah, it's a cool story. And are such a good instructor, man.

Speaker 3:          01:33:23       I love listening to him. Talking to, he's so enthusiastic as a contagious, you know, like videos online. She could sell anything. We're going to make watermelon juice guy. So I, Oh shit, this is what we can do it. You're like, okay, watermelon juice. I've, I've had a lot of coaches since I was a very young kid and I've never had anyone as far as like a better coach than Henoch grace. Wow. I know, man from the source, man. I mean, think about that. Yeah. But there's of those guys from the source, but they just, they're not, they're not Hanner and all those guys are great. But as far as like, as far as egos and just being like a cool, like you and hang out with Henry anywhere and he's like a great Todd's office. He knows a thing or two about everything. Like he's like, did you say surfing?

Speaker 3:          01:34:02       And he has a black belt in serve fruit. You know, sue, she opened up his own place. Now he has his own Jujitsu place. Yeah. They, they left his dad's place. They went right up the street. Now him and his, uh, here on Huron. Yeah. Oh, that's amazing. So they shut down that and it's right up the street still in Torrance. Very close. I'll have the facilities. Ridiculous. Is the old place still open? Hines got down. I'm not sure. I'm not, I don't know the details on that, but I, I know Hannah and Huron on doing their own thing on. They're killing it. That's awesome. Yeah, dude, it's very lucrative in southern California to think about how many Jujitsu schools, especially if you're, I mean Henna and here on top of the food chain, but as far as business mind to, that's what makes her so special.

Speaker 3:          01:34:42       His business. Mine is insane. Yeah. He started the Gracie University. That was all his concept is they're willing. He came up with that. Well, let's see. Oh, someone who lives in the middle of the country. That's a great thing. I mean, it's not as good as being instructed by Hammerstein, but if you live in the middle of the country and you don't have to other instruction, that's a great note in Wyoming or some shit, and you can go online and real place snowed in my will.

I love snow. Did we fly Snowden? We fly together. Drink cocktails. It's amazing. No done. We're going to Snowden. I'm going to wear my far.

Speaker 3:          01:35:23       I don't care where my fire for Peta. It sounds like a legit place. Yeah, it does. Have you ever been in Wyoming? I've been to Wyoming, yeah. Do I just went to Idaho for the first time. I was just, Oh, you met the black rifle guys mast. Great. Got Great to see. They're all great. Yeah, they were awesome. Did you go hunting with him or no? No, no. Oh, well those mother fuckers humans, but yeah. Hey, that's not what I want to do. I'm just saying it's like, you know humans. You can hunt elk or, yeah. A lot of those guys who used to hunt humans become hunters. It helps them sort of cope with society. They also have, you know, they have a special skillset. Yeah. It was a little bit very good with the guns. Not even with just guns. A lot them get into bow hunting and a lot of them, a lot of that.

Speaker 3:          01:36:05       You and Matt would get along. Great Guy. Great Guy, right? Yeah. And the coffee's bad ass man. It's delicious shit. And I got my own Coffee Cup. I don't know. That's what I heard. Kid Black Rifle Coffee Brendan shop version. Were they calling it the big, big, big brown coffee? Smiling Bray about big brown blend. I like that too. With the Big Brown Coffee Co. I liked that too. Via Brown car rifle. Yeah. Nice. Your own grand. I know. Damn sign. I know. Ranching out here. Like a, what are those things? Entrepreneur. Yeah, I guess I got fucking boss, businessman type care. Dan. Fuck dog. Idaho is nice dude. They said the show is fucking great. It was really fun. It was a big ass place. Is Big theater down that side? Yeah. It's where the UFC is. U of C's there in July. What car does that? Um, that's junior Joe Santos versus dude, he's fighting that Russian lead character.

Speaker 3:          01:36:54       Who's he fighting that off yet? No, not Volkov new. That's the talking. Forgot about Volkov. I know. Darkest of dark horse. What's that? Even off, isn't he? Um, wasn't he the guy that was the belt or champion at one point in time? No, that's full cub bro. No, but I think he was first. So it goes, yeah. Black Golf, ignorant black glop. Ivana. Ivana of, yeah, black boy Yvonne off. I think he was, um, just Google him. I think he was, uh, he was either a world series of fighting champion. Might be that we're, I think you're right on world series. That's not built tours. Is it? Maybe world series of fighting. Let's see. Oh, he's world series. You're right. He's world series of fighting. Yeah. He's a tough mother fucker. That kinds of crazy story too. Um, he was stabbed and he almost died. See if he could find that story.

Speaker 3:          01:37:47       It's a, it's a crazy story. Got their mean Juhas no favors. He was stabbed I think more than once. I'm pretty sure this is the guy, but just to just Google his name and stab. Sure. You're not talking about Darren till no, no, no, no. Darrin tells, well he needs to be Marie as well. Everybody can stay. Yeah. A lot of people got stabbed like against that, but I think he got stabbed. Yeah, he got stabbed. The God. Yeah, I'm serious. Let me see. Bell Tours. You see, did find Bell Tor to Ivana reportedly stabbed in the heart clean to life support, right? Yes. This was like 2011 what year was this sweet memories of fighting champions. So good with shit that I shouldn't even know. Um, yeah, he got stabbed in the heart. So he fought for Bella tour and then he went over to world series and now he's in the UFC and his first fight is junior dos Santos.

Speaker 3:          01:38:39       Damn. No, that's not his first fight. No, I feel like he's fought already in the UFC. No Way. That's his first fight. Is it okay. My first fight for sure. I must be thinking about the world series of fighting. Yeah, that's his first flight. Cause he thought Josh Copeland World Series. He's a tough motherfucker. This guy though. Very tough. Tough. It depends what junior we get, you know? Right. And this is junior and that also had a Usada scare. Something happened with him, but then they let them off the hook. Right. I don't, we never hit right. That lets us, to me, that's the problem with you. Solid as they go, this guy flagged. But then if they get, you know, proven innocent, there's no big writeup. There's no big announcement. Like there should be a fucking, maybe didn't really proven innocent. Maybe it was, um, wasn't a diarrhetic or something like that.

Speaker 3:          01:39:21       Yeah, it was diuretic. Maybe didn't get proven innocent. I mean, what was the last time he fought? Maybe he just hasn't fucking grizzled. Steepbank yeah, that was steep. It was last fight. How long ago was that? May of last year. It was a good fight. So how much time do you get suspended? It depends what you're up, but six, 12 months, right? Depending what you took. Right. But if you're going to take a diuretic, is it the same as taking Jews like that? He took a steroid. You get longer, right? Yeah. Hm. It's all weird, man. It's almost, it's almost confusing. It's like what they say about the Tour de France tour. France knows how it's pronounced. It like Brian Cowen would appreciate that too. De France Tour de France, they say that it's healthier actually to do that with drugs. Those do without drugs. It's so brutal in your body then when they take, yeah, and we taking fighting's the same way, like it's so taxing on your body.

Speaker 3:          01:40:04       Yeah, that was my point. Yeah. I mean, I really do, but I didn't want to, I wouldn't want everybody to say they have to be on it, like everybody has to be on it. I wouldn't want me, that seems like maybe we shouldn't do it. If you have to do, and just Santos admits he's still scared of Usada. I won't say it doesn't bother me. Hmm. I wonder what the actual, he was flagged, but he was a proven innocent. That's insane because we don't, there's no huge announcement about it. See, that's dangerous. Right? Because if that, I mean, how long did he get sat out for a month? It said, and under. He hasn't fought since then. He wants to fight again right after c, but you're, you're guilty. It's like if a girl accuse you of sexual assault right off the bat, if that goes on Twitter, you're assumed guilty with these guys.

Speaker 3:          01:40:45       It's, oh, he's a drug user. But then I had no idea he was, yeah, I have no idea. I had no fucking clue. I know. I saw the announcement that making that final oh yeah. Always back. Who was he supposed to fight though? He was supposed to fight someone else and it got rescheduled, I believe. Am I wrong? Was Sing dollar? No. Is Francis Right? Oh, Jesus did. He's supposed to fight Francis. Oh, it was in September and fun. Oh my God. The one thing I wish the UFC would do better, even this isn't the UFC, but it be great if they did announce when a guy's vindicated, when he's good to go. Yes, I need a fucking celebration like this little birthday. So they're, they're good to go. The other thing is when guys retire, like so many guys retired, like let's do something for them.

Speaker 3:          01:41:23       Like guy like Rashad Evans, UFC hall of Famer. One of the best guys to ever do it. Great Dude. He put the UFC on the map. Let's do something which they do for them. I need fucking something or celebration of his career some. So it's just I need something, man. You just can't go. Yeah. Thanks for the Times. Here's a tweet. I just, I don't feel like that's right. Not for everyone, but for a guy like Rashad, we need something won the ultimate fighter. One of the light heavyweight title think of is rivalries with a fucking Jon Jones. Jon Jones, Quentin Rampage Jackson. He based being too tough. Fighters never fight like he's had some crazy times. Now. It's funny, man. Fighters, people think about you as, you know, your fights. You have late in your career. They forget that crazy fights that he had earlier in his career. Oh my God.

Speaker 3:          01:42:08       See, I think the ones that he was doing these paths, whatever, four or five, which were tough to watch, I don't think of her shot like that. Yeah. He's a different guy and there's something that happens to fighters or to human beings, uh, when they don't want to do it anymore. And I mean, I think it happens with every job, but if you don't want to do it anymore and you're a printer, it's not like if you don't want to do it anymore in your fighter. Correct. So if you don't want to do it in, you're a fighter and you kind of half asset and you're in there with a guy, you know, like Glover to sharer Cantonese Smith. I mean he's in there against dangerous guys that are trying to kill hungry lions. Yeah. It's just, it's a bad place to be. It's a bad place to be.

Speaker 3:          01:42:49       You, you gotta be all in, in this, but it's not a sad thing because, you know, like that ridiculous safety for, uh, the Seahawks retirement. Cause they had some neck issues. He tried, he tried to figure out he's a pro baller and he retired after eight years. I went, Damn, eight years. That's a good run, man. I like how long is were shot been fighting that the fucking run man. Dude, he won that season one. Season two as a heavyweight. The heavyweight. Yeah. Remember he fought bad. Brad, what was this bread? I am proud. I am so that's right. Right. And then remarried his fight after that with uh, Sean Sam Salmon. Dana. He goes, Dana was give them a stink cause the fight was boring and then just tack and fucking, we knocked out chuck Liddell. That was like the first and he did this to his heart.

Speaker 3:          01:43:30       Yep. I remember this time out with one punch dude. The special, when I think about Rashad, he was so special to me and my career because he was like in our camp and he was like, the guy when he won the belt, I marriage train with this one. The belt came back and it was the first time where like, he would speak truth to us because at the time I had a girlfriend, I was super in love with it. I didn't want to leave and go to training camp, all this stuff. And he's like, dude, how old are you? I told him, he's like, I'm telling you it's gonna be different, man. You got us make decisions now based off this and you just drop knowledge about the professional life of fighting. And I remember when he won the belt, he goes, uh, he was sitting down.

Speaker 3:          01:44:03       He came back like a week after training and I go, dude, fucking crazy. Or did you just feel like out of this world I feel the exact same. Nothing feels different. I feel the exact same. He goes, it's cool and you want this goal and your achieved and I have the belt and he goes back to work, man. He goes, I thought I'd feel completely different. He goes, you got to get better now. I gotta get better. He goes nuts. It's, I feel just like you do, man. It felt right before I won the belt. He fought Machida when the Cheetah was Machida. Machida were there too. There was a time for a couple of years where Machida was just put it on piece scares Gann UFC for awhile. He was such a weird guy to fight man, because he'd be like doing this. Yeah. He'd be doing all this weird movement and then he would blitz in on you.

Speaker 3:          01:44:47       Nobody knew what to do. Knock out power man. That in his last fight with v tour like good low, those uh, one of the best knockouts. So see pulled that up. Pull that Leo Machida Kaos Vito Belfort and now he's in Bellator belt. We're making some waves, son and saucy over in Beltour, right. Saucy. How saucy things going to get to whatever. Be Tours on thing. Proof, sleet type Sausa look like Ryan Gordon. Dude, how bad is it right here. Let see how he's almost too respectful. Oh, he knew me. This, he just, I mean he was out cold. I'd almost rather have you set up right. My knock. I know, right? Let's, Ooh shown like this is embarrassing. This makes it more embarrassing. Hands on. Yeah. And then now he's fucking, his eyes rolled back. Yeah. Damn. And then, and then I guess the UFC, I want to see that.

Speaker 3:          01:45:36       Wanted to work with them a little bit, but he just went to Belk toward cause he goes, you saw it as a way to strike, man, I'm out. That's what I'm talking about. Let's see. Can we see in real time or they only have it here? Look at this man. Look like, fix that. Boom. One more time. So what's interesting is like v tour always would talk about standing square. You know when I first started trading Carlson Gracie's in 1996 old school, it was before Vituro made his UFC debut. That's when I first started Jujitsu and feed tour was 19. The feed him, he was always talking about um oh, here it is in real time. Look high moves man. Liotta so sneaky. Look at that. That is phenomenal. Let me give me that one more time, son. In real time. He gets down on his knees. Leo Machida, the way he's moving here. So slacky I mean he didn't even see that comment. He's, he's looking at these crazy hand movements. I remember before this, he beat on a Andrews who's a big up and comer football player at Alabama. He beat him. Start v Toilet. Yep. I'm out. Yeah. Now he's at Bellin Story. You get Roy McDonald. Gigger. I'm saucy. There's some fun [inaudible] his brother over there to test the waters. Like tell me pee Pete.

Speaker 2:          01:46:50       How's it going bro? What kind of car? What kind of toast? And they get that Ryan Bader rematch. There's some cool fights. Yeah. Especially if they let them get saucy. I mean he and he's 40 years old. Do I think the other scary thing about Bella tours that dad's on days on days, that dead zone, where the fuck they're going to call it is given them, they gave them a nine figure deal. Who did you remember about this? Does zone deal? I don't know what you're saying. Does, oh hey z n what is that? It's their streaming service, so now they signed with them. So now Bella Tor, you remember how they had tape delays? Now you can stream it digitally for ff you get that now for five quality. I think you have to pay for it just like much. I Dunno, but you can stream it on your phone.

Speaker 2:          01:47:31       First ones can be free. Their first like welterweight big fight is going to be a free, everybody wins in Beltour deal with days into stream live events. So thinking about who they got right. Okay. The Guy Gay Guard who uh, they, his people just contacted me. I'm going to get gay garden saucy on the podcast. He's fighting Roy McDonald. So they got gay guard. They got Roy McDonald to absolute world class fighters. Absolute world class, top of the food chain. Maybe the best one, 85 and the best one seven in the world. Certainly in the argument, right then Shit, you know, grind baiters never looked better. Ryan Bader has never looked better. He might have to wait Terman right. Man, I'd ever beat Jon Jones, but he's never looked better. You know what I'm saying? Phenomenal. I mean, he looks fucking incredible and he knocked out King Mo. He could be heavily champion, could be heavy.

Speaker 2:          01:48:14       He's light heavyweight champion. Right? Who knows, man. Maybe him going up to heavyweight would be better for him. I mean, maybe it doesn't have to cut weight. Maybe you could fight more trimming, especially as an older, as an older guy in his thirties if he can beat Mitrione, that says a lot. Well, he's really gotten better and better and better. You never stop getting better. Then of course you got Paul Daily, one of the most exciting motherfuckers in any weight division who's got out nuclear missile for a left hand. Michael Van and page phenomenal. Who did Paul well, Paul [inaudible], his last fight with Fitch was brutal. Man, that doesn't fit. Fitch is going to Fitch. Okay, but why make that fight? That's what I'm saying. Why? Why do that? That's fine. What are we doing? How would you diminish, why would you diminish daily like in, in terms of what he was marketability after the Larkin fight, so he chaos Larkin who lark and I was felt like it was a dark horse at one 70 especially after he fucked up Neil, Maggie, Neil, Maggie.

Speaker 2:          01:49:04       I was like, dude, this guy is just, he's got a lot of weird skills, man. Larkens got a weird way of moving. He's got that oblique kick that he does to the body and he struggled in Bellatore came over there, you know, he's fine with Lima, Lima, the motherfuckers [inaudible] him. Lima beat them, but it was close to in a row and then he got chaos. Yeah. See Man, you and us ones last semester. You're in a slug fest with Paul Daley. Dude, that dude has got something crazy in his left hand. But you know, after doing Paul Daley and Michael Bennett Page, Paul Daley signs new Bella tore contract except Joe shillings call out. Oh, Jesus. Joe Schilling. Dan in MMA. Yes. Joe. Cylance shillings fighting MMA. Now Paul does not taking anybody down. They're going to stand. That's interesting. It feels kickboxing match. I'll be more excited. But do you think Paul Dale is gonna try to take them down after all the shit he talks about guys taking him down?

Speaker 2:          01:49:55       I don't think there's a chance in hell. Yeah. [inaudible] Joe Schilling fighting kickboxing, one of the best kickbox in the world. MMA tough for him. He wants to fight him and may now that's what he's doing. I'll watch it. Here's the problem that Joe's been having is they don't give them enough money and kickboxing, Bella toward kickboxing even. It's just not materialized cause he's not with Gloria anymore. Right. He's belter. Yeah, I know. But he was in Gloria or no? Yeah, he was in glory. And then he came over to Belle tore a couple of years ago and he's fought well. He said, I love you. I loved watching him. Fuck kickboxing for whatever reason, Bella tore kickboxing just does not have the appeal. Can you call it doesn't have the appeal. That's crazy to me, man. I do not understand. I do not understand. Really. I do not understand. I do.

Speaker 2:          01:50:37       Boxing is popular. How was kickboxing not pocket? I don't know. I, I've watched Bob time much rather watch southern kickboxing. Did you watch Rico Verhoeven's last fight? Sure did. Fucking, that was amazing. It was cool against, uh, I'm not stopping my plan, Ben Siddique you're not stopping. You're Friday night for it. I would if I didn't have shit to do. I know, but, but yeah, but have shit we've done. We've done glory fight companions. Halfly. Yeah, I did a glorified companion with Joe Schilling. And who else did it? I was in here. Well listen, you would've been here. True. I never miss fite campaigns. You're going to make fun of the things I love. Like I made fun of your soccer. I see. Where do we go? Full comment down on me. Full Circle, sir. I got to find something to eat. I love kickboxing. I enjoy kickbox and I think Gloria puts out the best product.

Speaker 2:          01:51:22       I think Gloria is phenomenal. I'm actually bummed out that lion fight is not on a access TV anymore. Yeah, they lost their deal with access TV. Well, if you've done fake plants for land fight, probably still be around. So did one. No, no, no. I think we only did Gloria Phi companion for glory. Bam. Joseph. That's right. Eve Edwards and Joe Schilling Son 2016 so I would have done it since then. She didn't have time, man. Okay. Just cause it's kickbox love it, but you would fucking down for, you know, but we only did one Bella tore to, we only done one belt tore ever. The hope was that it was a big belter. Yeah. Who was that? Who was fighting? It was all Kaos and submissions. It was amazing. An amazing card. No, Shane hasn't bought borough dare you shut down your mouth. Jamie. Jamie was like fucking to work. Dare you. Shamed car when she goes. Never fought Bella toys. No bench. You son of a bitch name came to my head shaved. I apologize. I'm thinking, who the fuck was, it was a big belt door. It was you. Me and Eddie did. It was phenomenal night. Was it fade or [inaudible] 98 but it's not. Who Was it? Fatal war fade or Frank Mir. Oh yeah. Bombs on bombs. On bombs. Yeah. Fade Frank Mir was chaos.

Speaker 3:          01:52:46       Yes. Good night. If you know Frank Mir. I really appreciate that guy. I appreciate the way he thinks and talks about fighting too and one of the things you said is like remember fade or a hip toss them, slammed him on his back and he said he just got up and just wanted to swing at him. His Ego got the best of them and that wasn't the plan. The plan wasn't just recklessly abandoned and gauge on them. Yeah, but he almost beat him. He almost beat him. He had them wobble. Well this is the thing I think fade or gets you into his groove. Like he did that with our live ski. He's done it with a lot of people. It gets you into his group with any in any cracks you would send them over. He's done it to Brett Rogers but I think that I was, I was curious to see how that fight was taking place because in the beginning frank was catching up.

Speaker 3:          01:53:26       He called rushed in, but frank also said ring routes is real. Like he's like, dude, I need the experience. Like I haven't felt that kind of like nerves and stuff going to fight in a long time. Like it's been a long layoff for me. He's like, yeah, as long as he been off two years, two years. He's like, I just need to get back in there. Yeah. What do you don't just they mine that's supposed to sign with them with belter. Scott Coker is on the phone with Barnett and they've worked together before. So you know that boy Barnett gets in there. Molly, Mario Batali's in the kitchen right now making some salt. He's chopping up some basal and some garlic. Fucking right. Let him for they're heavyweights. Get saucer. Let them get sauce on net saucy against Ryan Bader. Well, who do they have? They have bater.

Speaker 3:          01:54:08       They have just zoning. Uh, Chael Sonnen, um, Frank Mir. Remember when Frank Mann, when Josh Stop Frank Mir actually realize how good Josh's Josh the nightmare. It's a nightmare. I remember we beat the brakes off. Roy Nelson beat the shit out of him for five rounds, beat the shit up and showed some serious cardio. Serious cardio to do that for five rounds. Yeah. Josh is a nightmare for all those dudes. Oh, he's phenomenal. Yeah. He might be Bellator heavyweight champion. He could special if you let the man sleep in, you know what I'm saying? Kind of like went into, oh, just trust it. Don't hate on them. Just look at it. It's all yellow and it's all healthy. Older would just skills for days, leave him alone. Yeah. That's the problem. When those old dudes get ahold of that juice, they got all that year, those years and years of learning and experience and then all of a sudden the body starts moving like young man's body again.

Speaker 3:          01:54:56       That's why t r t v toward was so fascinating to, he might go over to bell too. I wouldn't be surprised if, well he might tell him with Ryan, but he might go to bill. But if he goes to that door for a detour is like, he's like, dude, you know, you guys touched a little bit. I don't, I only want that bell tours dies. It's too strict for me. I don't want that. Well, that was one of the things that, um, Rory, I'm not Rory, um, that uh, gay garden was Saucy, was talking about guys fighting him. Who was he? Who was he bringing up that he would need extra testing from? He was just talking about this gay guard was just talking about this. Like someone will five or 85 at 85. Who Was it? Machida. That's Rao. Machida. Yeah, that's right. Because he lost a decision to mature over in Bellator.

Speaker 3:          01:55:40       He wants extra drug testing for Leo to Machita. They rematch. I don't trust that guy said, whoa, bell tours are going. No problem man. The we checked. Yeah, we like sat on, it looks like pee tastes like p set up once. We did it twice. The auto confirm it's PPN tastes. We let them know six months in advance when he's going to be testing the heads up. He's getting tested a lot. Yeah. We post dated all must get samples. He has a full schedule. You want it to look, we have 12 urine samples. We took them all on the same day, but we've got them.

Speaker 3:          01:56:09       That's what they need to do, man. Even that's too strict for fucking be toward though. Hey, have you heard anything about Tony Ferguson? How's his knee doing? I don't know what is going on with her now. Eddie. Eddie Bravo just had shoulder surgery a couple of weeks ago. He just took his, um, I think actually a week ago just took the stitches out. Yes. Bad from an episode because I remember last time I saw him torn his story. He's like, he's going like this back. I'm good man. I'm good. And he's doing this well, it must not have been good. He must've done something to hurt it again and realize he just should go ahead and bite the bullet and get the surgery. I need to get them a sim styles or whatever the sem stills. I need them. Stem cells in the left team. Dagestan braking. If the negotiate negotiations of on the fight.

Speaker 3:          01:56:52       Okay, this is Russian. A translation team could be versus notorious MMA will not be achieved. Then next week UFC announces fight team could be versus Tony Ferguson, x t UFC two 29, October six. How can he come back that quick? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Phil. You know, real, I mean, MMA team Dagestan that doesn't work. Yeah, but wait a minute. Let me think of like when Tony go to Tony Ferguson's, uh, Instagram show, I'm like break dancing. Right? When did Tony Ferguson have a surgery? That was before Brooklyn. Before Brooklyn was what, how many months ago? Was that? Two months ago? Correct. There's no way. How's he do that to and from, from four months. I hear controversy. Khabib is happening. Yeah. Fucking happening this year. That's really, that's what you're here. That's what the, that's how the UFC gets him out of jail. I said this and I don't think they give up.

Speaker 3:          01:57:44       I mean, there were find out what's going to happen in, uh, in July, right into the, so there's go to these, uh, just go to the actual images. The, yeah, go back and then scroll down. Let me see that one right there. The words moving around or is the video, let me see that this is him recently. Hmm. That's fucking slow. Yeah. He's just controlled. I mean, Tony's an absolute freak, so when he's ready to go, he'll be ready to go. But it almost hurts him because he's such a freaking, he wants it so bad. He might not be ready. Right. And he might hurt himself, but he's gotta be with state of the art guys. Ma'Am. It's Tony Ferguson thing. Was that one up there with, so he's doing that one right there. No, right. You just had it. There you go. Look at this. So he's getting on his knees and crawling across mats. So this, this does not totally live very guy who's ready to fight though. It looks like he's just breaking down scar tissue. That'd be a little strength. Flexibility, motivation, creativity, increasing tremendously. Not 100% but close

Speaker 2:          01:58:43       champ step seven weeks out, 11 weeks out. That's not much time, man. That's not even three months. That's a weird thing. It's like, you know these guys, they have incredible willpower and in incredible endurance and incredible like just the focus and drive and discipline to get better. But your body has to heal. If I'm the UFC, I'm paying to an open house. Stem cells work. But if I'm Dana, I'm paying for Tony. See a stem cell doctor every week. Yeah, no way back work. That would totally help. I mean maybe it would help. I think everything helps a little bit, right? It's amount of what, how much is, it's not like you could really measure it. Like you've got a body chart where it can look at your diagnosis is and go, oh yeah, look after we shot the stem cells in, look your number here from fucking fruit rollups oh yeah, yeah.

Speaker 2:          01:59:31       I mean I'm sure he's, I don't know what he's doing. I would assume he's doing something. I would do growth. I'll do a shitload of growth, which you might get flagged to. I don't know what they're doing with testing, but I don't think he could really test for growth. Um, I'm honest with you have to do bloodwork. I don't think they're really embed a man. I think it's real, real iffy whether or not they can catch you doing that. The Igf one to get to growth and its short half life, you have to do blood work. So I don't know how they test these days. How do they test and they randomly show up. They get blood in urine or just have no idea. They've never done, I still have those guys could probably get away with it. Correct. That's such a dangerous move. If they flag you with it and then you're out for a year.

Speaker 2:          02:00:09       Yeah, but if I'm injured and I have a doctor's prescription for HGH to recover, I'm doing all that HGH stem cells with the UFC allow, you can't even have a fucking ivy like while he's going through all this, he can't take an ivy blame. Is that give you Phil's dehydrated health still terrible. What do we do about this? What if he wants to get an Ivy Nad drip, which will help them recover? I know. What if he wants to get a IV in that's not even like outlawed, but if he wants to get IV vitamins like vitamin infusion, you can do that. But for the, if you're then the UFC business, why wouldn't you want that guy to be on all the HGH you can get just to recover so he can fight cubby to fight for one 55 which were all vying to see.

Speaker 2:          02:00:49       Yeah, that's good for business you to say flying. Fuck what he's, how he's doing. You'd want him for sure on the stuff that you can do, like platelet rich plasma or you know to send them down a Panama fucking like a David Lee Roth Song. Panama. I agree. Dot. But the thing about Panama and go into like Dr Neil Riordan and doing all that shit that a Mel Gibson was talking about on the podcast with his dad. Yeah. That stuff's legal. So legal in Panama, you go down there and they'll, they'll do shit that Tj went down the road, gone down there twice. He's gotten in there twice. Illegal teacher's doing, it's legal. It's totally above board. You're allowed to do it. I'd fly that fucking doctor in here and I'd have it. You can't do it here. You have to do it in Panama because they're doing things that aren't legal in the United States. Well, all right. Either way. Private jet Tony says, you know what I'm saying? I'm saying anyone gets hurt.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       We got this covered. This is not enough money though. She, the thing he said to the UFC made more money last year than ever before. Right. It's like a record year. Okay. A lot of it was like all these deals, but do you know how much money they must have to pay every month? That loan, they have $4 billion purchase. That's so much money. They just signed a few fucking nut with ESPN in the streaming deal. European plus. But do you think they have enough money where they could fly guys down to Panama every time everybody gets hurt. All 500 and we're not, I'm not talking, I'm talking about special treatment. I'm talking to Tom Brady. If I'm the New England patriots, I'm flying down there by any means necessary. Okay. When do you take it off? When do you not allow it? Do you let Michael Kia fly down there?

Speaker 3:          02:02:23       Nope. You're shaking your head no. No Dad. He strangles pedis? No. Oh, was he raised? What's he rate you sign up for a bit. We'll have to find out. It's also Pettis has an executive in on Kevin Lee send Kevin lead down there. Probably the same. Kevin [inaudible]. Kevin Michael didn't, he choked him out. Denny. He didn't tell me and the kids got a lot of star power to it. Doesn't mean I'm like a shitty promoter. Yeah, no. Kevin was levels to this game where like, like if Lebron gets hurt, we're flying them some. Yeah. Michael Kassan. Number nine. Kevin Lean number five. Okay. Do you fly down Dustin? Poirier Ooh, you don't write these fucking guys. What am I [inaudible] numbers? No, he's lost two. We're not playing. Ah, you don't fly him down. Maybe he can find to now fight nights. Can you try to replant and get a bunch of them in at one, sir?

Speaker 3:          02:03:21       Listen. See, now you're talking to Michael Johnson from the Michael Johnson fight with Justin Gagey. He gets flown down for the rest of his fucking life. Check brain cell. Yes. We're going to go through the ears. Check brain cells. I'm going to get them to lie with his head on one side or fill his ears up, let it soak into his brain. You know there's holes in his ear and then let him lie down on the other side. Fill them up with stem cells. Just go right through the nose. We're going to the whole body. I mean I'm giving Khabib, Connor, Tony, Eddie Alvarez and Nate Diaz the fucking frequent flyer card in the bitch. Do you know that? Um, that's something that, um, Kyle Kingsbury said he did. He did some sort of nasal exosomes. Right? And that w do you remember him talking about that? Did you talk about that on the podcast or off the podcast?

Speaker 3:          02:04:06       He's into all kinds of crazy jacks. State of the art shit. Oh shoot up treat. He's a big fella. That's a big fella. Cow Box checked super athlete too. Does everything to try and get the best body possible. Well now that he works at on it too, like that's his job. You know, it was on the, on top of everything new that's coming out. What can help and what, what's the newest, latest, greatest shit. So you're saying he injected testosterone bright into is, I don't know. I, these exosomes with that I think is the shit that makes a stem effective into his nose. Was he talking about there was had Ben Greenfield, God dammit hang out with, he was Ben Greenfield. This is why I think it was okay. Now I remember in Greenfield, Ben Greenfield crashed his bike hard and really hurt himself. His nose. Yeah. He hurt his head.

Speaker 3:          02:04:54       And uh, one of the things he did, that's who it was, one of the things he did to mitigate CTE is have exosomes shot up his nose. He did it. I ve had it done up his nose and he did like a full body exosomes treatment. Help do it, isn't it? Did you know Ben Greenfield is, I've listened to you gotta have him on your show on fire. Zippo. Yes. First of all, he's a super genius. Tell Brian is shut the fuck up. Always talking to, can't I feel like shouting Brian's pile rocks? No, but he's also a super athlete. Like he does a lot of crazy shit, like tough mudders and all that stuff, but he's on the ball when it comes to the latest and greatest stuff. He did a whole article for, was it Esquire or when he shot his dick up with stem cells and talks about all the different things he did to his dick.

Speaker 3:          02:05:39       Oh really? PRP and stem cells into his deck. Yeah. Any self administered as Dick has like Gil's now and he's a super genius, but Brian will teach us to Brian, shut the fuck out or leave them at home. I know. Tell Brian we don't have the podcast. Do you know the, the French Alps where they train us gears? Hey God damn it. This may talk just today. Please let them tell them. Go. Please don't die. I went Benzie ards, wind him up and let them tell him drop science on me dude. That dinner at the posted with all those smart people. Yes. Trying to solve the world crisis or what was going on there. And where'd you guys eat? Eating, talking shit. Like you talk shit like we talk shit. Probably no date. They're smart guys. Smart Shit though, right? Oh, there's some shit talking. Especially it, Sam Harris is very funny.

Speaker 3:          02:06:21       Believe it or not. Yeah, he's very smart dude. Yeah, he's real funny. Fucking Weinstein is very funny. Uh, Peterson was there, right? Yeah. And Jordan Rubin. Dave Rubin rather is Dave Rubin's a standup and then Jordan Peterson can be funny sometimes. He's a just insanely smart though. Does one person start the topic and then you guys go around like a round table now? We were all just talking and then some, sometimes we're all talking together in a couple of times. Broke off in a separate conversation was a lot of people, you know those big dinners are tough. You don't to talk to, you break off in groups who's close to, you know? Yeah. It was fun though. It's fun knowing people that are way smarter than you. That's my entire friend. All my friends are smarter. Well, I thought about this element. Oh Wow. Everyone's swearing. That's what you want though.

Speaker 3:          02:07:10       Yeah. You don't want to be one. This was the smartest guy in the group. You're fucking, that's not good. You don't want to be just like, you want to be the toughest guy in the room. You don't want to be that good training partners. Also sneak tough training partners get good. You know what I'm saying? You don't wanna be the best fighter in your gym. Well, really interesting people. It makes you crave interesting conversations, makes you more interested in different subjects. They motivate you the same way. Like if you were trained with Brian Ortega, you'd want it to be tighter. You were motivated by watching them. It's like I did a podcast, I think Drinkin Bros with Matt best and those guys and they're all super high level military guys. They're asking me about fighting or whatever and we're doing our Dick Jokes. I'm like, nope, hold on.

Speaker 3:          02:07:48       Cause I want to hear what they say about the military because they have this fucking that they're black belts and military and all that combat experience. So I flipped the script on them as fucking fascinating. Well your, your listeners are going to hate this because they pray. I know this but it went by in like missions and how it goes down. I'm so fucking fascinating man. It is. I don't want to talk and hear them talk. Have you ever done a podcast with Jocko? No, I fucking, uh, I don't know him at all. I woke up early on the other day and felt like a tweeting and be like, what's up now? Bid. You welcome for all your, what time are you up? Uh, I think like four something, but he posted, he was up at like five something. I'm [inaudible], he's been on the carnivore diet before it was the carnivore diet.

Speaker 3:          02:08:28       He just eats steak. I look at him, I think that steak, you know, knows I need to have him on the podcast. He would be a great guest. I know wheat. I think someone goes, man, we need to get Jocko and fire the kid. And I put let's do it. And he goes, he goes on their boots. You got to figure it out. Yeah, just get, I'll, I'll give you his number. I'm just show. But uh, he's, he's one of those dudes were you, if you read his stuff enough and pay attention, it will increase your motivation. Just will. He's the real deal. You know, he has this video call. You ever seen this video? Good. Here we're seeing good. Please play. Oh my God. How long is this going to give you a rock hard boner. What is it? A couple of minutes. Two minutes long. It's tough to motivate. One of my favorite. I've watched this at least once every six months. And I'm not bull shit. Really. Yeah, we played it on the podcast, right. Go a full screen and uh, gimme some volume and don't start it prematurely. You son of a bitch, let it load up.

Speaker 3:          02:09:22       One of my direct subordinates, one of my guys that worked for me, he would, he would call me up. Are we positive side? What's his background? Navy seal commander man. Say No more fam. Okay. Direct subordinates. One of my guys that worked for me, he would, he would call me up or pull me aside with some major problems, some issue that was going on and he'd say possible. We got this and that and the other thing. And I look at him and I'd say, good. And finally one day he was telling me about some issue that he was having some problem and he said, I already know what you're going to say. I said, well, what am I going to say? You said you're going to say good.

Speaker 5:          02:10:01       Uh,

Speaker 3:          02:10:03       he said, that's what you always say when something is wrong in going bad. You always just look at me and say good. And I said, well, yeah, when things are going bad, there's going to be some good that's going to come from it.

Speaker 6:          02:10:21       Didn't get the new high speed gear we wanted. Good. Didn't get promoted. More time you get back. Oh, mission got canceled. Good. We can focus on the other one. Didn't get funded, didn't get the job you wanted. Got Injured. Sprained my ankle, got tapped out. Good. Got Beat. Unexpected problems, good opportunity to figure out a solution.

Speaker 2:          02:10:57       That's it. When things are going bad, don't get all bummed out. Don't get startled.

Speaker 6:          02:11:03       Don't get frustrated. If you can say the word good, guess what we meet? You're still alive. It means you're still breathing and if you're still breathing [inaudible] you still got some fight left in.

Speaker 2:          02:11:29       Get up, dust off, reload, recalibrate, reengage. Go out on the attack.

Speaker 2:          02:11:47       Gangster. Dude. When it comes from a guy like him, I know it has a different meaning behind different meaning. Yeah. When those guys speak, I listen. Then I fee. I hear that sometimes when I run, when I'm running hills and listen, I'm tired. I just go, good, go, let go. I'm tired. Tired. Good. You're supposed to be working hard, good fight with a girlfriend, but good. Don't bring a bit. It's having that attitude though. Like making that switch in your mind to just look at things at a different way. Everybody can do that. Everybody that's not unattainable. When you listen to something like that, the real beauty of something that inspires you like that is you hear it and then you can actually put into action. But do you ever have a problem being self motivated Joel? Like I like the don't your mind. That's fucking fantastic.

Speaker 2:          02:12:31       I've never been a guy who's been drawn to the motivational stuff or, yeah, I just never have been. I've, I've never needed it. I've been blessed in that regards. I don't know what it is. Even when bad things happen, I'm always super positive. Always. No, that's great. I see bad things. I'm not comparing my bad situations to fucking jock on the in ward. Right. I'm talking whether it's a fee one, I lost a fight. Um, if something's going wrong, if it in stand up and it's something business wise, I don't get something. I'm usually all good. I always have. I'm usually pretty positive. You are. You're very positive guy. I think that's one of the secrets to your success is that you look at things in a good way and you have confidence and you act. You know, I mean I tell all these young standups, I go Brenton Charles and doing comedy for two fucking years.

Speaker 2:          02:13:16       You gotta look what he's doing. This is what, when an athlete goes after something like you, you, you have the work ethic of an athlete and the mindset of an athlete. But you're also funny. See the thing about comedy is a lot of people that are really funny or also we're, we're were personal saboteurs. We self sabotage, we are impulsive a lot of times get addicted to things is like real, like the type of person that becomes a stand up as a person who says ridiculous shit. They say things that as socially unacceptable things cause they know it's going to get a rise. They hang around with a bunch of other degenerates like you and me hanging around and you get, this is a certain style of person, like a Joey Diaz style of person, but you are an athlete who has those attributes. So for you, like what I tell like young guys in particular go, this highlights the importance of discipline.

Speaker 2:          02:14:04       It doesn't make you less funny. That's a cop out. Like a lot of people think that discipline makes you less funny. There's the comics have these weird cop outs. Like you don't want to be a guy. Works hard. You want to be a guy. It's funny, some guys are funny and it's effortless. Yeah, that's nonsense. Working hard in everything should work hard in everything. Everything you try to do, you should put the more attention and more focus you put on it, the better you're gonna get at it. Correct. I just don't want to be a loser, you know what I'm saying? I don't want to embarrass myself or people either. They pay for our ticket and be like, Dude, Jesus Christ. Well also you can do it. You can do it. Correct. You know you can do it. So if you can do it, just keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          02:14:38       Get better at it, keep working at it, keep swinging. It's a fascinating thing to do for a living then. You know the best. Fuck kidding me. But discipline man. So I've, I've, um, I've never necessarily had a problem, self motivating, but I've always drawn inspiration from a lot of different sources. Yeah. I'll go to the rocks Instagram page every day. Every day. No bullshit. Cause he's always hustling. I see the Rock, he's always fucking flying around in a jet. He's always in the gym. It's a little bit put the rockin splash. But Kevin Hart, he goes, no, no, no. He does too. They're really not on jets. The jet thing is, I know it's money, but when Kevin Hart's in the gym all the time, that inspires me for sure. Workout. He's constantly in the gym. Doesn't mean I'm going to work out because of Kevin Hart. No going to work out already.

Speaker 2:          02:15:22       You're just like, fuck yeah, like watching people kick ass. There he is. Bam. The Rye also like people to kick in it. Like I, I don't hate anyone. I root for everyone. Like I, it's almost a problem. Why root for everyone? Yeah. I almost think it was almost a, it was my downfall as a fighter and as a football players, I would root for everyone. I think anybody, I want everyone to do the pudding, but it helps me any comedy. Like I want everyone, I want everything to be good. Yeah. Like I did a show at the ice house and they're like, you need to open up for you. And so I called Emily at the comedy store. I'm like, Hey, do you have to door guys who are vying for spots? She's like, fuck yeah, give me a list. So every show I, I'm always trying to bring the door guys in.

Speaker 2:          02:16:01       That's because I'm like, how can I, you know what I'm saying? It's like, yeah, everyone to do well. That's because when I look at like what inspires me is like when you post a video in the crowds in Idaho or whatever, or Krista, Leah, you know, are, are like the crew when guys are doing like, to me that's, it's trying to keep up with that. I, cause I feel like I'm in this, we're in this race, right in this race together and everyone's fucking beast and animals and you've got, you're going to fall back in the PAC man be a loser and get eaten by these lines or you keep running with these monsters. Yeah. That's how I look at it. Well it's a great attitude to have in anything. If you want the people around you do well, it's a great attitude to have with everything that's been, it's one of the major secrets to my success for sure is have a bunch of people around you that are kicking ass and then like helping them, helping everybody, promoting everybody, letting everybody know and encouraging everybody.

Speaker 2:          02:16:52       And then, you know, when everybody's doing great and everybody's, it's just, it feels, it's a good feeling for all involved. When people go selfish and they only want a good thing to happen to them and they get upset of good things happen to other people, that's poison, man. That's jealousy doesn't work. It does the opposite of work. It does. That's, so there's a, there's an actual quote about that, that jealousy is one of the rare emotions that achieves the opposite effect. That an intense too because you intend to like diminish someone by being jealous of them, but in fact, you diminish yourself. You're putting the energy into things you can't control and it does not matter. Yeah. I forget who made that quote, but it's even uglier when it's jealousy amongst friends and we all have seen it. We've all seen, it's weird. It's a weird thing to see it.

Speaker 2:          02:17:36       It's weird to me. Uh, when I was flooding, it was weird to see people who, I won't mention names, but we're all in the same group and a guy who would be fighting, you could tell they didn't want him to succeed. I'm like, dude, we just, we just went through an eight week camp, like tough, tough. I'm like, Oh, you're, you're jealous man. With his success. It's not to, you can go on your own path. That's a weird thing, man. With comedy, we don't see, I thought I'd get it way worse. I thought people were going to fucking hate me when I walked into the store, laugh factory. But we, I don't see it around there. And if I do it, they're not say it to my face. But what is it? Well, it's also once you're proven to actually be funny, you're in, it doesn't, nobody gives a shit.

Speaker 2:          02:18:15       Everybody just wants you to be funny. But if you were like some guy who was like maybe an actor that was kind of half asking it and people would come to see you just because you were an actor, but you weren't really trying. He didn't respect, which we've all seen in the gas. Well, there's been a bunch of those people that tried to get sitcoms back in the early days and during the Sitcom days when there was a lot of comics like that. We're getting these deals and then that they would do a sitcom based around them. Very few of them ever became like a Seinfeld or something like that. Yeah, but they gave it a lot of deals. Manville mental. So there was a lot of actors who got into comedy and put together like a quote unquote act to try to get a deal. Like they would, they would do it because they would look at it seeing like, look, if they're just going to audition for shows, it's really difficult to stand out from the crowd.

Speaker 2:          02:18:58       I mean, unless you look like Luke Rockhold or you got some, you know, you're the perfect Ryan Reynolds looking fella. It's fucking hard. Fuck you. And then if you're a girl, like you have to be like really hot or you have to be really big. Like you have to, some has to be funny about you, right? Well if you're a stand up, there's no rules. Like you can be Ali Wong, you can be Roseanne Barr, you can be, I mean there's no, you just have to be funny like anybody matters, right? So a lot of actors looked at it like, oh, I'll just put together an act and aw man, stand ups

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       would hate them. Hate them. I'm sure. Want to go well either because it's within like it's whoever it is. Let's say fucking John Goodman's I started doing stand up right. And he came on stage and I'm like, go fuck, that's John Goodman. Then after about three minutes like okay, let's John Goodman, they'll fucking do man. Well that was Michael Richards. You know, Michael Richards wasn't really, it didn't really have a background in stand up. He had a bass on. I didn't know that. Yeah, he was like, he would do like, he would, it wasn't, didn't have like an act. He would do like he would fall down on stage and play like he was doing Kramer Character Kramer. Yeah. It was very strange. And I don't know if he did it for a long time and then stop doing it for a long time and then started doing it again after Seinfeld.

Speaker 3:          02:20:09       But before he had that, you know, air quotes incident at the laugh factory. Um, you know, we'd seen him a couple of times and it was weird. You know, it just, it, it was like a really, really famous open Mike night guy. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Strange. It was like a guy who's super famous but really hasn't been doing it that much because you're going up at the laugh factor comedy stuff. You've got to remember it's murder. They're not booking those people. So it's murder drone for whatever reason you got in, but you're on that line up with Belper and you and delay. You got to go up and the crowds used to seeing high level fucking stuff. Yeah. This was like what, 2006 or some shit, when did all that go down with him? Brian said was at the Improv and drove trouble. Well, I had gotten back to the comedy store and uh, I think it was Brent Ernst, I think.

Speaker 3:          02:21:02       I think he saw it. Yeah, he was over at the laugh factory when it happened and he came back. He was like, he was like, Yo, I just left the left factory. He goes, fucking crane was up there throwing the end. Bob and I was like, Oh, what happened? He goes, dude, it was crazy. He lost his shit. He was getting heckled. So we had heard about it. But then when the cell phone video got TMZ released that shit, everybody was like, Oh God, set match. Like this is a new thing dude. Yeah, it was weird man. I was uh, I was going sit in the belly room the other night and I've never seen Brody Stevens who stand up. I've never seen them. And they got up there and just again, I, I, I know who he is, obviously he's always running by Mercedes and then he just came out like doing crowd work and not using the Mike and I looked at Sam, I go, what the fuck's he doing man?

Speaker 3:          02:21:49       He's like, you've never seen him like going to go just watch. And it was so funny, man. Forever. And it's just fantastic. That does. Crowdwork for he does was warm warmups for so many television shows for so many years that he's like super comfortable just talking to people. Yes, it was fucking done. A special came out recently. I think it's on iTunes. Oh really? Lie from the main room taped it and the man doing that set this, the Kinison set the spot. No Shit Dude. That's so cool. Wow. When did they do this? Just came out recently. A couple weeks ago. He was talking about on stage did for them. He can go around and he'll go Iowa like, yeah, for my goes, there you go. Moves on the explosion like Jesus Christ. Man. It was so funny. He's a weird guy. I'll be here to 2:00 AM 10:02 AM I'm like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          02:22:38       That's how he kicked it off. I'm like, what is going on right now? Well his uh, his style is so unusual because on paper you would never understand where the punchlines are. But then when you hear him say you can't stop laughing. Yeah. Yeah. It's like I was dying. I don't know if he writes it or if he just does it. I wonder, I'd like to ask him if you write stuff down or if he just does it. Just a few guys like that that are just funny. The way that like Theo's like that funny the way they say shit like Theo says shit that I could say the same shit. It wouldn't be funny but he says it and it's fucking hilarious. Yeah. That's the kingdom out comedy man. Like nobody really knows what funny is until you hear it. But there's also something, uh, Steve, uh, Simone [inaudible] he was saying, um, cause I, I was telling him I go, he goes man, your hair a lot and go yeah, I'm, I'm trying to just jump on anyone shows cause I want to make sure it's not my crowd.

Speaker 3:          02:23:30       You know, cause you got to figure out what's funny cause you just played your shows. I don't want to be that guy. It was who told you that? Who the fuck told Jay goes, everyone here is trying to get their crowds. Here's when you're on the road. Do you want your crowd man? And I'm like, I know, but when I'm here on make sure it's not my crowd because I feel like the funny uncle at the barbecue, if it's my crowd right, you don't find out what's working. Yeah. The Ice House, if it's my crowd that, especially at as I've walked off, feel like Kevin Hart, like blood flow. That was a fucking a plus. But then you go to the comedy store and it's not your crowd. Like that was a d that was a fucking dudes. That's true. But if you go to the ice house and it's your crowd and you actually record it and listen to it, you can do, that's important.

Speaker 3:          02:24:07       You can tell what is actually gonna work, what's not gonna work. You can tell and then you can tighten it up so you have extra confidence at a place like the ice house to do different shit. To me, what it's like, it's like cross training, like it's not a bad idea to do some kettle bells and run some hills and do Jujitsu. It'll probably make you jujitsu better. And I think just doing crowds were, no one knows who you are is great, but doing crowds where they know who you are is great too. And as long as you're paying attention to get a different thing from, from each one, yeah, you're right. 100% right. Yeah, it's, I mean the, you also get different things from different size rooms. You know, there's certain things that will work at the laugh factory in certain pockets that won't work anywhere at calm.

Speaker 3:          02:24:50       It's so strange to me. It's a weird thing man. It's very strange. Strange as it gets you feel any different energies. It's so cool. It's so fascinating, man. [inaudible] you want to talk to him about the comedy store and like the history of it? Steve Simone just, yeah, he knows a lot of shit. Steve's been around for a long time and couldn't be a nicer guy. Might be the nice guy and he might be the nicest guy that's ever lived. Almost like this. Like a darkness back there that I want. I want him, I know on what's going on. Well I push him. C'Mon he's, he's open about his dad and I was like, can we come from a good family? It sounds like you come from a nice guy, a good family. Just one day it was opened up for, are you in San Francisco? I wasn't. Yeah. The cobb's cobb's is an interesting room. It used to be the tiniest room. He used to be like 150 people, a little tiny room on the road, but it was so good. Everybody wanted to do it and then they moved to that place, which is like 454 50 giant ass ceiling. It's a big place. It's in crowd there too. Damn liberal. Well that San Francisco man, San Francisco, highly educated, very progressive. It's you. It's, you're doing a different kind of comedy there. Did an abortion joke.

Speaker 7:          02:25:53       Ah, they

Speaker 3:          02:25:54       didn't like it. [inaudible] that's Larry. I'm more of a reference, but it did not go well. Yeah, you can feel it. Yep. Is there anything worth? Nope. But you know what it is, is when you run into a subject that people don't accept, you gotta ask yourself, okay, does my sense of humor different than theirs or did I do a shitty job in figuring out how to get that subject to them? You know, because some subjects, like there's quite a few bits that are going to be in my Netflix special that when I first started doing them, they weren't that good. There was something missing. Like I knew there was something there, but your, you don't, you only know so much when it's written. You really find out what's good when you try it on stage and then that's when it sort of comes to life.

Speaker 3:          02:26:41       It's like I have almost every bit that I've ever done written in some way, but they're all rarely the way I do them. Yeah. You know, once you get on stage with it, that's when you start fucking with it and figure out how to do it. More of an outline. Yeah. And then we'd go on stage like, yeah, but it's, you know, along the way sometimes it just tanks, you know, that has to happen. This isn't something I stick with it though. Don't, that's so crazy. This isn't what I tell you just the other night man around. They'll move it around, but a good beating, like doing it where it doesn't work makes you just refocus. Like, let me go back and look at this thing and figure out why these people got upset. Oh, you know what? If I just do this first, then they'll know where I'm coming from first to let me get away with that because they won't think I'm an asshole.

Speaker 3:          02:27:23       You know it's weird. And you finish your especially finish editing yourself. Yeah, that's uncommon. Right. But I didn't have much to edit in terms of like content. It was just how much should I cut out and wear what, you know, what show was the best one? That was what it was really a lot of the best one was the first show I heard Tony, as soon as you guys get done, cause I text you in a text on and he goes, I don't even know why we're filming the second one. I'm my mouth. The first one. It really is. Yeah. Out of the park Paul slugs. It's fun man. Wilbur Wright. That Wilbur theater is amazing. That places, you know, cause it's like a theater but it's also like a comedy club cause it's like there's 900 or 1100 people in the room and uh, I think it's like 500, 300, 300 or something like that.

Speaker 3:          02:28:08       Yeah. Reminds me of the palms if feel you've come kid, the palms, the palms. It's like people who are right on top of yet. Yeah, they're right on top of you were most theaters so far. You can't feel it. Katt Williams did the palms one time when we were there. I didn't get a chance to see him though. God, he's fucking, he was there. I think he was there like the day before the UFC or something like that. My brother went and saw a Kevin Hart. He was at Pepsi Center. Oh yeah. I God, I wonder how, how the fuck do you pull off? Stand up the Pepsi Center. Jay Goes, I know. And my brother's a little bit of a hater by nature. He was, he can't be that good. And I'm like, dude, he's like the most successful comic ever touring in the stadiums. I bet it's pretty fucking good.

Speaker 3:          02:28:46       And he goes in there and he was, I'd like Brown stage like three 16 he goes, dude, it was incredible. Best. Best he's ever seen. Wow. Which is crazy. So fucking power house man power is, or how hustling performance powerhouse. Yeah. Interesting. Right. It's interesting when you see those super winners, those super winners that just pushed the envelope of success. It's weird. You know those, those qualities are very strange. It's also strange in comedy because someone, Kevin Hart might be Your Cup of tea, but then they might hate bill burr, which it's very strange to me. That's silly. Why don't I shouldn't say hey. You know what I'm saying? Like, yeah, like bill burn might be just okay to you, but Kevin Hart's your number one. Yeah, but that's okay. That's normal. There's always going to be people that have different tastes. That's that same with music.

Speaker 3:          02:29:37       That's the same with four shirts. Everything percent. Yeah. It's crazy time for stand up though. If you think about how many different comedians are really good right now and have specials, it's nuts. Netflix is blown up, blown up. Do you know Russell Peters was the first comic to get a Netflix special? When did he get is a long ass time ago. We heard him in an interview talking about, I think it was with a sway in the morning and he goes out as the first one and they say, how much did they pay you? And he talks about it. He goes, ah, he goes 10% of what Chris rock got paid. And they looked at him. And when was he the first one? What year was it? Old School. Really find that look good on a Russell Peters comedy special prosecutors is a monster. I had one on Netflix in 2005 I think Russell Peters beat Ya.

Speaker 3:          02:30:22       Probably if he was first. Pretty sure he said he was first two then five Goddamn Goddamn, I don't even know Netflix was back then. Yeah, nobody knew. That was part of the problem. It was like everyone was going on. So when people like my specials on c so I'm like, oh fuck to what else is going on this weekend with the UFC? What are the fights? Are there? Well you got the ultimate fighter finale on Friday. Prayers. Are Any others on that card style bender pull up. Ooh, style. Brender I did Brad to vars versus tile vendor. Perhaps a motherfucker man beat him, but I think I really love style Benner. But uh, Brad's been quietly foreign. Oh. But also Brad is a guy who the rumors he's injured go on this fight. He was going to call the fight off. He's injured. Dare you say that online?

Speaker 3:          02:31:06       No, it's all over. It's as it, yeah. What's he injured with? I don't know. He's supposed to pull out, but he's going through it. So it depends. People forget bracket and fucking wrestle too fucking. That's a tough fight. Fire style bender from Nigeria 13 and, oh son. He's a motherfucker. He really is. He's so exciting. Damn. That's very good. Let me see the right, the regular UFC card again. That's a big fight. So that's the headline fight. Yeah. And the ultimate fighter, which is you see them, you see they're selling the ultimate fighter house. The title, the ultimate by selling. They're selling it really. Five Mil son. You want it five now. A good investment. What did you just like 19 bedrooms, p people peed all over that house. Oh Dude. He would go on there. It's going to smell like a dude's ball. Do jacked off in the sun's out rom font.

Speaker 3:          02:31:52       That's a good fight right there. That's a very good fine go con sacking and Kaleel round tree fucking fight. That's a real good fine Felder, Mike Perry. That the fucking fight. That's right. Do you remember an elder at welterweight? Very interesting. He's a big dude. Felder has to cut some serious weight to make one 55 Felder's a monster on the Mike too. He's a great commentator. Very Smart Paulo Kosta in Uriah Hall. That's very interesting. I'm not at 2.0 I'm not saying Paul Coast has done all the drugs, but how does he pass this fucking tests? What? Whose nose is clogged up for that sniff test and his allergies are kicking in that forgot their inhaler? Like how does the [inaudible] he's just not live wherever his house is. Dude, he is first team. All Landover nod on that car to go down there. It's close. Oh, what your car clothes and Landover Nada.

Speaker 3:          02:32:48       That might be the sleeper. The night folks. Yeah. I get this phone once you've been talking about that fight on fight pass. That's crazy. Hooker and Burns is a more fucking fight to Gilbert Burns. Dan Hook or holy Shit. What a card this is. Yeah. To this card is insane. Great Card. This is an insane car cause people aren't even talking about this hooker burns fight. Dude. You know what's going to be sad though? I think the pay per view numbers. Oh, how dare you. You never know Steve paid versus DC. It might get into twos 20 hundreds well and a lot of people like Max Holloway and Brian Ortega. You don't think you can make it into the to do hell yeah. 200 200 be a nightmare to 50 was the last one, right? Which is not good. I see. I'm hoping it does around five to 600 make GSP fight again.

Speaker 3:          02:33:31       You need GSP back bring GSP. But he's the last one. They get real good numbers. He got eight 50 right? I know, but see I think this does around between 400 600 yeah. What do you think Jamie? I hope so. Do you want me to wait face? It's tough to tell these days, man. I think they need to get rid of the pay per view model. It's obviously not working. What do you think they should do? I think they should put these on a, on for free. I think Jewish Poland, ESPN, these major fights. How are you gonna pay people? Well, the paper you model top four NBA guys are getting more than the top 10 NFL quarterbacks and those games are all free. So there's one somewhere, right? There's a model. That model is not working. Yeah, but NBA is way more popular than New York.

Speaker 3:          02:34:13       She was on the board, but it's also free. The sponsorship deals, the endorsement deals or you know, they have major endorsements. Right. But there's only so many endorsements that, and they'd get behind cage fighting. You know, it's such a crazy dates in for bud light Miller lite. Like we've had some big more now. Right? Yeah. Roughly the same amount of people. Also like same amount of fighters. Same on NBA players. About 500 yeah. Yeah, yeah. There's no comparison in terms of overall viewership though. Like, what is a big basketball game? NBA Finals. 35 million. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 100 on it. Yeah. I'm just salient view models. So old school, especially now with the illegal streaming, me and Jamie were talking about it. You know, if I'm not that guy, cause I find I'm not trying to steal money from UFC, but there's a link I can go to every time that's in HD.

Speaker 3:          02:35:02       I don't have to be a fucking dime for really everyone. So many of my friends do that. I have so many people so they're going to jail when uncle fester finds out. So when the numbers are low, you've got to take that in consideration. 18 to 36 males can figure it the fuck out there. Not like $70 no. I wonder, I wonder if you just had it free if the numbers would be bumped. I don't know man. It's like you're going to make it. You've got to make a big fucking risk to do that because you've got to think of how much money the U of c has to pay every month to make that loan to make that monthly nut that's on them. That's not the fans prompt. That's true. The other problem is think I'll expensive. It'd be an MMA fan these days, so I'm, I got to fork out money for ESPN plus now just to watch how much does that, was it nine 99 you could call it low and five bucks a month.

Speaker 3:          02:35:47       That's like, I think it's 10 okay. Okay. Nine 99 so you got that right. What does that go live? Because fipass is still 2019 January, so I've got to pay for that. So that's money, additional money and then paper views, there's one every month. So if I want that, that's 70 so it's $80 a month just to be a UFC fan. Not following. Watch dies on, dies on, dies on Bella tour. I got to pay. How much is that going to be? Nine 99 to watch the Bella Tor now, is that what it is? Let's say it's nine 99 less than that. I'm assuming something's wrong with the streaming service. So if they just had a free streaming service and then you had ads, do you think they could make it up? I'm sure what, but my point is it's going to expense would be an MMA fan and you're losing fans and the numbers aren't declined.

Speaker 3:          02:36:31       So often there's a business model problem. What if they made a deal with Netflix? They tried that and no Netflix, Amazon. Those guys didn't want to play a game. They went and your audience isn't big enough. Really? No, they went, we'll Twitter will use the NBA. We're going to the NFL route. Cause the the other sports too big. Hmm. Twitter. What are they showed it on Twitter. Can you get Twitter on your TV? You could send, if you have it on your phone, you could almost it. Yeah. You can just send it to the screen. Yeah. Yeah. What is your phone runs out of batteries in the middle of the fight? Your friends call you pussy. We'll plug it in. It's out linking. It's up playing off your phone directly. Now when you do it, I'm, I do it through apple TV, but you could do it through Google.

Speaker 3:          02:37:10       Android, right. You can do like Google play. You have like a stick that sticks in the USB show? Yeah, there's a little symbol. Um, interesting. Sean up there. I mean down all used to be science fiction just a little while ago, but I, I see shit on my like, uh, someone sends me a youtube video to watch. If I'm home watching something on apple TV, I'll just stream it right to the TV set. That's amazing. Is that us? Oh, well, uh, there's a little symbol like on the top by the bar just broadcast to a TV thing. It's just, I feel like UFC has this old school model right now, but with the UFC plus a ESPN plus it's at least heading in the right direction. But the paper, your model, especially as expensive as is to be a fan right now, they're making it tough. I think it's going to come a time where you're not going to need any streaming service.

Speaker 3:          02:37:54       You just to be able to type of website address into your television and it'll be universal. Everybody will have that. I think that's, that's real close. Like a lot of people getting rid of their cable. Yep. Dish can't apparently young kids, they never watched Katelyn ever. Yeah. I'm a dish fan, but most young kids don't fucks with any of them. Yeah. Like what dish? What? That's interesting, right? The only ass, Huh? The only thing it's good for really is live events. That's everything else. Netflix is more popular than broadcast cable and more in TV viewing. Hm. Hulu and Youtube all, I think it's, wow. The thing I read said it's got more viewers than all of those combined. Wow. That's accurate. Broadcast Cable, Hulu and Youtube. Netflix has more than everything. See if Netflix got the UFC, that would be crazy for the UFC, for the UFC flakes.

Speaker 3:          02:38:44       Like, dude on it. They could, you know what if they just said, we have so much, like how much is your not billion? 4 billion. Um, okay. Gonna just write them the check. We'll just buy it. It's like a pair of sneakers that you never going to wear and fight every day. We don't give a fuck just there. They could do it, man. I wonder. Yeah, that would be, but then how would you figure out how people get paid? You'd have to give numbers, right? It would have to be in the contract, because that's one thing about Netflix. They don't want to give away the numbers. So if you have a comedy special on Netflix and you ask them, hey, how's it doing? It's doing really well. Yeah, but you're really happy. Yeah. But you know, because like you, they go, you want to do another?

Speaker 3:          02:39:22       You're like, man, I must want it pretty well. Now if you do a special on there and you're like, how are we doing? Like all right. Yeah. Keep on keeping on, man. Yeah. Do you want to do another workout? We're all set. It's probably didn't go well. You don't have exact numbers, which I feel like is a little hairy. A little dicey because you have no negotiating power. Yeah, Super Dicey. Because if you're like, hold on, let's say you for instance, you're like, hold up 100 million people, watch this, I need more fucking money. Right? Like to them is 5 million watching good is 100 million. Where are we at here? No we negotiate. That can't be right. Like they can't be good but it's their business. They started it. It's, that's the thing is like you don't have to do it. They're trying to do it on HBO and then you get real numbers or you could do it on showtime and you'd get real numbers or I could do it on Amazon. Jeff Bezos tells you to go fuck yourself. Do you think you're at a disadvantage

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       for your non Netflix these days? Cause, cause here's, here's my argument that I had with Brian about things. Shoot special is net don't give up. Netflix is the king man. And if your row, if you're, you, if your bill burr, if you're Kevin Hart, if not Kevin Hart, if you're fucking Chris Rock, any of those guys, right? They're paying you mass amount of money and they're promoting it. But if you get lost into that shuffle because they have so much content now it does pay off. I Dunno, you know, I'm Gaffigan interestingly enough, decided not to do it and he could do it anywhere and he decided to do it on, on all platforms. So he doesn't have it on Netflix, but he has it on a bunch of different things. So you see where Gaffigan put his specialist, but he did it on his own site. Right. And released it very Louie CK style.

Speaker 2:          02:40:57       Yeah. I think um, he actually, I think it's available on Amazon. I think it's available on a bunch of different things. He's so established though. Yeah, sure. Dapkins that mother fucker people still ask them to do is hot pockets. Yeah, that's a good point because I think that they probably, no matter where he goes, his fans are very loyal. They'll go seek it out. He's one of the biggest in the world. Yeah. But I'm saying if you're like, let's say you're a guy like Brian Cowen, like where are you gonna get the most exposure? Honestly Youtube the most exposed free, which is be release it for free for three, but that's very expensive to do. He says Gaffigan's Nobel ape. Initially it will be released on multiple pay TV and digital platforms including Apple's iTunes, Amazon video at t and t charter communications, Comcast Cox Communication, direct TV, Holla at Directv dish network.

Speaker 2:          02:41:41       Oh Shit. Google play. And Sony playstation says war rise almost. Well, Walmart has rooted thing. Microsoft's Xbox and album version will also be released on the same day in digital and physical formats. That Emma fucker. Good Fan Sizzler, a $5 download via the Louis C K now. Hm. Yeah. It's interesting. It's interesting because I think that uh, he could do it. So if he does it and then it really works out well, maybe Kevin Hart might do that too. They might say, listen, I could try it for 99 well, he can do whatever he wants. He might be like, Hey, I'm Kevin Hart. I could just have, people are going to go watch my special. I just don't put someone can do that. Yeah. There's a small hand, if you're, if you're a smaller level comic, let's say B list, you can't do that and make money. People are going to see it. So maybe you get, you get money back when you go on the road.

Speaker 2:          02:42:33       It's like, Holy Shit, that was great and it's free. So we got on the road and in theaters now maybe. Well that's the thing. Do you know how many comics I've done that and had a youtube video that became a giant smash and then we're selling out theaters. What does that girl, Angela Johnson, you know Angela Johnson? Yeah. She was on that TV shows at hilarious bit about the Vietnamese girls doing her nails. Yeah, that bit got on Youtube and she was selling out crying Gel. Yeah. Quit told jail. She's hilarious. Very funny. Yeah, it's fucking hilarious. She was selling out giant plays to that extent and how that, Christina is similar to that, but Chris Delea on snapchat, his videos were so funny. Yeah. It made him insanely popular amongst other stuff, but that's one of the,

Speaker 3:          02:43:12       you know, he had millions of followers on there. Yeah. So you go into a city and he's a brilliant comic and you know these one in the biggest of the world now. He's so silly. He's a unique kind of silly, so weird. Silly. You would hate us if you saw our texts everyday about shoes and fashion. Easy Dad shoes came out. I'm like, dude, I can get you want a peer? He's like, yes. And what are Yeezy Dad's shoes? Jamie, you're going to hit well. You might like him. You like him more than the three 50 booths. Sweat these boy, just sweat peas, boy, converse with these balls. Dude, I'm not so sterile. Red Suede. I know I'm wearing these just for you. When did you get those converse? Send it to me. I would never, I was going to say there's no way you in a story.

Speaker 3:          02:43:54       He sent me those, but I put on my saw where these mother fuckers, those are fucking daisies. Those things. Those are usually easy. Gee, dad shoes. And you liked those San Jose sharks fan? I do not. It's like a shark. No. Let me just say this. That was the first easy and I can, I can get them to coming out. But I went, I'm going to pass on a pass on those, you know you to go Chris, you want these. And I went, Chris, these only good on small guys. He goes, you're right, but I'm smaller. I go with the right outfit in small genes can wear mills. You're right Brent. We're going back and forth and you're series shot or serious. I sent to Brian went fuck you. Ah, because Brian likes to wear those boots to make him look like he's an Italian painter.

Speaker 3:          02:44:27       Correct. In wishes. He is taller. Yeah. He's got those boots with wooden heels with leather soles that are really slippery strand and they have zippers on the side. So I'm like, what the fuck are you wearing? You're supposed to wear these when you were in Catholic school. Like why, why are you wearing this as a grown man is 51 years old. He's crazy. He never had a period of time. We dressed like his age. Never. He's like finally old as his dress. Yes. Like he is now the age she's supposed to be. He like got older and fell into is establish wardrobe. Not anymore, bro. Oh my God. No fuck is happening. That's not, why is he dressed like a skater? Wait a minute. Are those slides identical? Him? Wait a minute. That's Brian. Dude. That's fucking Brian's. Brian. Count. Cool. Make that face bigger. Very blurry dude.

He wants me to dress him and I'm going to get Tom Special. Don't, don't, don't, don't let him be himself pulled. No, he dress for where you want to dress, bro. That's what I told that it's him. It is him. There he is. Where's that? Those are, those are black socks and sandals or others. No, they're not. Those are, uh, those are skate shoes too. Those wearing skate shoes. Slow roll down those shoes. I was hoping that those were black socks to Asian style. I thought they were black socks and slides because they're so gross with a white stripe goes over the top. What are those slides? Is that the property was black socks type? Let's do it. Yeah, there you go.

Speaker 3:          02:46:00       Is that everybody does it? Yeah. Tight Move Joe. You can do it with slides but you can't do it with flip flops. Correct. Like slides and socks is okay? Correct. Why do they have rules like that? It's the streets bro. Know what it is. It's gross. If you liked that sock in between your toe, would that bar with a flip flop like master splint or some shit like a Ninja do that. Remember those Ninja shoes? I'm Adam as well. They called tabbies or something like that. Oh God. Oh that's hilarious. And everyone, dudes, you'd go, Oh, where those kung fu shoes. Do you remember those Kung Fu shoes? Did you, you didn't grow up in the east coast to do now a lot of dudes in like the 1990s and certainly in the 80s would wear where Kung Fu shoes. She just does whatever dress up.

Speaker 3:          02:46:47       Like they knew Kung Fu, my contents and parents, those things. Oh, I bought you. Those are Todd's, those are called pods. Those are Kung Fu shoes. Sun dews would where Kung Fu, like they knew Kung Fu because they had those shoes on and be like, Damn Dude, I'm not mad. I was, oh shit. Like those, those are different. Those are the lives of more fashionable. Yeah. That's like the first ones you show or some bullshit. Somebody had a bit about it. About dudes show, I think it was. Um, do you remember that guy that had a bunch of fucking, he had a bunch of bunch of specials on Hbo. Robert Townsend. Remember that? Remember Robert Townsend, remember he had a bunch of a HBO specials where a bunch of different comedians on. I feel like someone on one of those did a bit of Kung Fu bit about dudes in the ghetto who dressed up like they were Kung Fu outfits.

Speaker 3:          02:47:36       I'll tell you who I don't fucking trust dudes that were aqua socks. What do you mean by aqua socks? Like blue socks? No Bro. Aqua socks. Like if you went to waterworld or like a waterpark, aqua socks, wearing them out in public, do nothing drudged up fucking girl up. Worse than Aqua. A mood bring a fucking rare there. You can still give him at Walmart and shit. Who wears them? My Dad wore them when I was a kid. Those lawyers, those you walk around with those long. Yeah, I forget the waterpark. So you attraction. Okay, that makes sense. But dudes where I am in real life. Yeah. Hmm. Like some asshole. You didn't want to be a superhero. Maybe they're just ready for water at all times. Like what is the purpose of those? So you don't slip on the outside of the pool yet? Cathol hot and shit.

Speaker 3:          02:48:18       Okay. To quit being a pussy. How about that? But those are like very similar to like minimalist shoes. Those are cool. So you bring up cool ones. Fucking hold on. How was that? Cause those are dope bro. Like that. Well that's some shit you would run in Sagwan. Yes, I would. I know that's what I'm saying. I'm talking about the original aqua sock, but it's different. See that one right there that you just showed that last one. The last one. The one above that. The one that looks like a normal sneaker. Yeah. Like that. Like that. Yeah. That's dealt those look very similar to the shit I wear when I run some TVs. I run the with those, uh, they, they have like nothing to them. They're still rolling with those. Yeah. I love those dude. My feet are way stronger because of running that way.

Speaker 3:          02:48:56       100% made a big difference. It definitely made a difference. Yeah. Because your feet have to work way harder. It's not like a, if you run in a pair of like, I like to run in like speed cross shoes cause they got a lot of traction. You could run on anything. You don't worry about where step and you just dump on Shit but you don't, you don't, your foot doesn't have as much engagement. Like when there's no cushioning at all and it's a thin layer, your foot is like pushing off and gripping some shit, but you can't just jump strengthens your feet can't go fucking full. No, can't tie. No, I tried you little fuckers. You get that plant. You got that planner. I did that. Plantar Fasciitis is no joke. Simon, son, I'm back to cushy shoes. Yeah, easiest and shit.

Maybe they'll do it in here and do it. It's supposed to be insanely painful. If you do the push nav where it's like 15 minutes. It'd be funny if we did a podcast. It's supposed to make your guts wrench like someone stomping on your stomach, but if you get through it, you get through it in 15 minutes versus eight hours. Hold up 15 slow dreads and what to do. It's supposed to be incredible for anti aging. I'm down for that. Yeah, 15 minutes.

Speaker 3:          02:50:25       15 minutes of like just the worst podcast of all time. I think it'd be a fun podcast because for the rest of the time he'd be fine. So like beforehand he'd be fine and then for 15 minutes you'd be like, ah, I shit my pants. And then to do that for 15 minutes and then how happy will be after minute after it's over.
