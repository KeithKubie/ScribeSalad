00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.290
We're asked to construct
a 10 degree angle.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.830
So we have this
little angle tool

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.110
here that we can use
to construct an angle.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:12.520
So just like that.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.105
And then they give
us a protractor

00:00:14.105 --> 00:00:16.390
to actually measure the angle.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.970
So let's set it up.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.966
Let's put the protractor here.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:22.340
Let's put the
vertex of the angle

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.790
at the center of the protractor,
in other words, center

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.642
the protractor at the
center of the vertex.

00:00:26.642 --> 00:00:28.600
Looks like the protractor's
a little bit easier

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.310
to manipulate.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.020
So let's do that there.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.230
Now let's put one of the
rays here at 0 degrees.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.000
And now I'm going to put
the other ray at 10 degrees.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.630
And it looks like I am done.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.320
I have constructed
a 10 degree angle.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.820
And you want to be
careful here when

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.160
you use this tool because
the angle in question--

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.660
let me move the protractor show
you what I'm talking about--

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.020
that this right over here is the
angle that we're talking about.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.080
If I'd switched these two rays,
the way the tool is set up,

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.950
it might have
interpreted the angle

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.940
as this outer angle
right over here.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.160
So be careful to look at which
angle we're actually measuring.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.349
But this looks like I
did the 10 degree angle.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:06.677
So let me check my answer.

00:01:06.677 --> 00:01:08.510
And just to be clear
what I'm talking about.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.060
If you did the 10
degree angle like this,

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.150
then it definitely would
have marked it wrong

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.440
even though the interior angle
right over here or this angle

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.150
right here might be 10 degrees.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.490
The way the tool is set up,
you see from this circle,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.980
that it thinks that you're
looking at this outer angle.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.690
So it's important to
make sure, at least

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.600
for the sake of this
exercise, that the system,

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.110
that the computer
program knows which

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.860
angle you're going
to talk about.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.480
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.055
155 degree angle.

00:01:39.055 --> 00:01:40.680
And this one's
interesting because this

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.320
is an obtuse angle.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.060
So once again, let
us put the protractor

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.670
at the vertex of the angle.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.350
So just like that.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.810
And now that seems pretty good.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.560
Now let's take one ray
and put it at 0 degrees,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.980
and then let's take the
other one and put it at 155.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.330
So once again, 10, 20,
30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80,

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.729
90-- that gets us
to a right angle.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.804
Then we'll start getting into
obtuse angles, 100, 110, 120,

00:02:13.804 --> 00:02:17.030
130, 140, 150.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.340
And just to make
sure that blue arc

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.355
is measuring this angle right
over here, not the outer one.

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:24.230
And let me move the
protractor out of the way

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.820
so we can get a good look at it.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.700
And we got it wrong.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.785
So let's see what we--
oh, 155 degree angle, not

00:02:32.785 --> 00:02:34.250
150 degree angle.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.310
Let me fix that.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.180
155 degree angle.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.065
Now we got it right.
