00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.780
Another equation that we will very often use, is Amdahl's

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.732
law, which we need to use when we're about speed

00:00:06.732 --> 00:00:09.972
up on a part of the program, only some instructions,

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:12.593
and so on. So, basically when we have a speed

00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:15.608
up, but it doesn't apply to the entire program, and

00:00:15.608 --> 00:00:18.087
we want to know what is the overall speedup on

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:21.714
the entire program. So the overall speed up could be

00:00:21.714 --> 00:00:25.746
computed, as 1 over 1 minus the fraction of the program

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:29.036
we didn't enhance. So for example, if we

00:00:29.036 --> 00:00:32.516
speed up 40% of the program, then this would

00:00:32.516 --> 00:00:35.735
be 60%, plus the fraction of the program

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:39.258
we did enhance. In this case the 40%, divided

00:00:39.258 --> 00:00:41.526
by the speed up we achieved on that

00:00:41.526 --> 00:00:45.402
enhancement, how did we get there? So the speedup

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:48.313
in this case is the improvement in performance,

00:00:48.313 --> 00:00:51.153
which is 1 over the new execution time relative

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:55.856
to the old. So this is the part that we didn't improve, just stays

00:00:55.856 --> 00:01:00.920
there. The part that we did improve, is shorter by the amount of improvement on

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.184
that part. It's very, very, very important to understand

00:01:06.184 --> 00:01:11.244
that the fraction enhanced here, is a percentage of the original

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:16.710
execution time, that is affected by our enhancemen. Okay?

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.490
So it needs to be that 40%, of the time spent on the program. Is affected by our

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.686
speed up, not for example, 40% of the instructions

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:30.990
in the program, or something else other than the time.
