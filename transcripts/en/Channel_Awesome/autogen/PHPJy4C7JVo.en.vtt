you can actually play with the exposure
 

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.620
you can actually play with the exposure
on this camera I think you can play with

I do that you'll see that you can

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:41.710
I do that you'll see that you can
 

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:45.120
I do that you'll see that you can
actually bring it down but alright way

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:45.130
actually bring it down but alright way
 

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:48.240

then I serve go back and forth I think

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:56.260
then I serve go back and forth I think
 

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:58.980
then I serve go back and forth I think
I'm gonna do this one usually because

00:08:58.980 --> 00:08:58.990
I'm gonna do this one usually because
 

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:02.640

this one it could be wrong but do get do
that now here's the thing there's also a

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:09.910
that now here's the thing there's also a
 

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.210
that now here's the thing there's also a
setting for automatic exposure now you

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:12.220
setting for automatic exposure now you
 

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.880
setting for automatic exposure now you
do that that automatically gets you to

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:14.890
do that that automatically gets you to
 

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:17.610
do that that automatically gets you to
sort of the even levels but the thing

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:17.620
sort of the even levels but the thing
 

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.800
sort of the even levels but the thing
about that is now let's say I'm saying

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:19.810
about that is now let's say I'm saying
 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:22.140

something I want get really close you
see the lighting sort of changes when I

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:23.500
see the lighting sort of changes when I
 

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.770
see the lighting sort of changes when I
come back the lighting changes again I

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:25.780
come back the lighting changes again I
 

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.600
come back the lighting changes again I
put my hand up here the lighting chain

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:27.610
put my hand up here the lighting chain
 

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.100
put my hand up here the lighting chain
point back here the lighting changes

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:29.110
point back here the lighting changes
 

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.620
point back here the lighting changes
that can be very distracting and a lot

00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:31.630
that can be very distracting and a lot
 

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.110
that can be very distracting and a lot
of times it can't be in your control the

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:34.120
of times it can't be in your control the
 

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.360
of times it can't be in your control the
camera just sort of takes it and decides

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:36.370
camera just sort of takes it and decides
 

00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:38.850
camera just sort of takes it and decides
what it wants so most of the time you

00:09:38.850 --> 00:09:38.860
what it wants so most of the time you
 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:40.680
what it wants so most of the time you
want to have it on manual one you want

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:40.690
want to have it on manual one you want
 

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.210

just get the setting right but there are

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:42.220
just get the setting right but there are
 

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.030
just get the setting right but there are
times like let's say you're filming you

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040
times like let's say you're filming you
 

00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.650
times like let's say you're filming you
know just home video or a documentary or

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:46.660
know just home video or a documentary or
 

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.880
know just home video or a documentary or
something like then you know you're

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:47.890
something like then you know you're
 

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.920
something like then you know you're
gonna be in a lot of places where the

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:49.930
gonna be in a lot of places where the
 

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:51.900
gonna be in a lot of places where the
Lighting's gonna be flying around a lot

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:51.910
Lighting's gonna be flying around a lot
 

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:53.900
Lighting's gonna be flying around a lot
and you needed to adjust quickly

00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:53.910
and you needed to adjust quickly
 

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:55.980
and you needed to adjust quickly
sometimes it's good to have it on audio

00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:55.990
sometimes it's good to have it on audio
 

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:58.170
sometimes it's good to have it on audio
or auto but most of the time you want it

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:58.180
or auto but most of the time you want it
 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.360
or auto but most of the time you want it
on manual with that so let's get this

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:00.370
on manual with that so let's get this
 

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:04.660
on manual with that so let's get this
back I think that looks about right

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:04.670
back I think that looks about right
 

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:06.760
back I think that looks about right
yeah after that this looks about right

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:06.770
yeah after that this looks about right
 

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:08.710
yeah after that this looks about right
and then what I do a lot of times is

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:08.720
and then what I do a lot of times is
 

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.420
and then what I do a lot of times is
that import into the computer and

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:10.430
that import into the computer and
 

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:12.490
that import into the computer and
another great thing about HD is that

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:12.500
another great thing about HD is that
 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.350
another great thing about HD is that
actually it used to be when we would

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:14.360
actually it used to be when we would
 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.090
actually it used to be when we would
shoot that we had to go darker or

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:16.100
shoot that we had to go darker or
 

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.400
shoot that we had to go darker or
lighter we had to choose between the two

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:18.410
lighter we had to choose between the two
 

00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.160
lighter we had to choose between the two
we'd go brighter so you can see it well

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:21.170
we'd go brighter so you can see it well
 

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:23.140
we'd go brighter so you can see it well
now with HD because it's getting so much

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:23.150
now with HD because it's getting so much
 

00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:25.420
now with HD because it's getting so much
detail you can take it and you can turn

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:25.430
detail you can take it and you can turn
 

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.340
detail you can take it and you can turn
up the brightness and the contrast and

00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:27.350
up the brightness and the contrast and
 

00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:29.140
up the brightness and the contrast and
it won't look that bad if anything it'll

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:29.150
it won't look that bad if anything it'll
 

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:31.300
it won't look that bad if anything it'll
look better so if you ever if you have

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:31.310
look better so if you ever if you have
 

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.710
look better so if you ever if you have
an HD camera you're wondering which one

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:32.720
an HD camera you're wondering which one
 

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.830
an HD camera you're wondering which one

you see how the screen starts to go a
little white when you bring the the

little white when you bring the the
 

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.930
little white when you bring the the
light a lot closer the reason that is

00:16:14.930 --> 00:16:14.940
light a lot closer the reason that is
 

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.840
light a lot closer the reason that is
bad is because if you're wearing a white

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:17.850
bad is because if you're wearing a white

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.730
well and that's going to sort of take
 

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:26.090
well and that's going to sort of take
away the color in your skin when you try

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:26.100
away the color in your skin when you try
 

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.240
away the color in your skin when you try

to key it and for whatever reason on
 

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.830
to key it and for whatever reason on
Adobe Premiere anyway the key

when I go through on this day is that I

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:18.790
when I go through on this day is that I
 

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.910
when I go through on this day is that I
go through the timeline everything that

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:20.920
go through the timeline everything that
 

00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.510
go through the timeline everything that
I shot and I pick out the shots that I

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520
I shot and I pick out the shots that I
 

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:26.189
I shot and I pick out the shots that I
like the most and sometimes if I'm not

00:17:26.189 --> 00:17:26.199
like the most and sometimes if I'm not
 

00:17:26.199 --> 00:17:28.680
like the most and sometimes if I'm not
sure maybe one shot is sort of similar

00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:28.690
sure maybe one shot is sort of similar
 

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:30.420
sure maybe one shot is sort of similar
to another or maybe a lot of variations

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:30.430
to another or maybe a lot of variations
 

00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:32.160
to another or maybe a lot of variations
on I'll hold on to the shaft by don't

00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:32.170
on I'll hold on to the shaft by don't
 

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:34.050
on I'll hold on to the shaft by don't
put the video not the video that I don't

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:34.060
put the video not the video that I don't
 

00:17:34.060 --> 00:17:36.510
put the video not the video that I don't
put the film footage in yet from the

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:36.520
put the film footage in yet from the
 

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:39.060
put the film footage in yet from the
movie I put in this is just going

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:39.070
movie I put in this is just going
 

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.720
movie I put in this is just going
through just getting a skeleton of what

00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:42.730
through just getting a skeleton of what
 

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.700
through just getting a skeleton of what
I shot just getting everything in order

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:44.710
I shot just getting everything in order
 

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.410
I shot just getting everything in order
so that when I do have the film footage

00:17:46.410 --> 00:17:46.420
so that when I do have the film footage
 

00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:48.300
so that when I do have the film footage
I just go in there and I put it together

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:48.310
I just go in there and I put it together
 

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.970
I just go in there and I put it together
now I'm gonna play with the brightness

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:50.980
now I'm gonna play with the brightness
 

00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.290
now I'm gonna play with the brightness
in the contrast you can see I can make

00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:52.300
in the contrast you can see I can make
 

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.120
in the contrast you can see I can make
it a lot brighter I can make it a lot

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:54.130
it a lot brighter I can make it a lot
 

00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:56.520
it a lot brighter I can make it a lot
darker and usually what I do the

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:56.530
darker and usually what I do the
 

00:17:56.530 --> 00:17:58.350
darker and usually what I do the
brightness usually is not an issue it's

00:17:58.350 --> 00:17:58.360
brightness usually is not an issue it's
 

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.390
brightness usually is not an issue it's
usually the contrast even though this

00:18:00.390 --> 00:18:00.400
usually the contrast even though this
 

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:01.620
usually the contrast even though this
looks pretty good you can always make a

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:01.630
looks pretty good you can always make a
 

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.240
looks pretty good you can always make a
little better so I'm gonna turn the

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:03.250
little better so I'm gonna turn the
 

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:06.570
little better so I'm gonna turn the
contrast up just a touch and now the

00:18:06.570 --> 00:18:06.580
contrast up just a touch and now the
 

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.580
contrast up just a touch and now the
thing with it you feel really high or

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:08.590
thing with it you feel really high or
 

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:10.530
thing with it you feel really high or
you can go really low the way it looks

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:10.540
you can go really low the way it looks
 

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.900
you can go really low the way it looks
great I'm gonna go to about let's see

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:12.910
great I'm gonna go to about let's see
 

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:15.480
great I'm gonna go to about let's see
that looks pretty good that's about 18

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:15.490
that looks pretty good that's about 18
 

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.840
that looks pretty good that's about 18
and yeah I have that for the rest of the

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:18.850
and yeah I have that for the rest of the
 

00:18:18.850 --> 00:18:20.220
and yeah I have that for the rest of the
footage so usually do that at the

00:18:20.220 --> 00:18:20.230
footage so usually do that at the
 

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:21.360
footage so usually do that at the
beginning because you don't want to have

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:21.370
beginning because you don't want to have
 

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:23.010
beginning because you don't want to have
to go in and do it for every single shot

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:23.020
to go in and do it for every single shot
 

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.170
to go in and do it for every single shot
oh yeah you should be moaning cuz today

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:25.180
oh yeah you should be moaning cuz today
 

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.260
oh yeah you should be moaning cuz today
we got the old state machine now

00:18:28.260 --> 00:18:28.270
we got the old state machine now
 

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.940
we got the old state machine now
something I forgot to notice you'll see

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:29.950
something I forgot to notice you'll see
 

00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:33.780
something I forgot to notice you'll see
is that I left about one second of

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:33.790
is that I left about one second of
 

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:35.400
is that I left about one second of
silence just looking at the camera I

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:35.410
silence just looking at the camera I
 

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:36.990
silence just looking at the camera I
don't look away I don't look down

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:37.000
don't look away I don't look down
 

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.300
don't look away I don't look down
and the reason for this I found out is

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:39.310
and the reason for this I found out is
 

00:18:39.310 --> 00:18:42.450
and the reason for this I found out is
that even reviews need pacing and that

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:42.460
that even reviews need pacing and that
 

00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:43.950
that even reviews need pacing and that
doesn't mean that you're necessarily

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:43.960
doesn't mean that you're necessarily
 

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:46.710
doesn't mean that you're necessarily
leaving just a long place for people to

00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:46.720
leaving just a long place for people to
 

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:48.330
leaving just a long place for people to
laugh cuz you know they're gonna live

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:48.340
laugh cuz you know they're gonna live
 

00:18:48.340 --> 00:18:49.860
laugh cuz you know they're gonna live
very long cuz you can't hold on a shot

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:49.870
very long cuz you can't hold on a shot
 

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:51.450
very long cuz you can't hold on a shot
for too long but I found in the

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:51.460
for too long but I found in the
 

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.280
for too long but I found in the
beginning a lot of times I would cut it

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:53.290
beginning a lot of times I would cut it
 

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:55.260
beginning a lot of times I would cut it
too fast and it wouldn't a lot of time

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:55.270
too fast and it wouldn't a lot of time
 

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:57.090
too fast and it wouldn't a lot of time
for what you're saying to sink in or

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:57.100
for what you're saying to sink in or
 

00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:59.700
for what you're saying to sink in or
process or something like that and just

00:18:59.700 --> 00:18:59.710
process or something like that and just
 

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.700
process or something like that and just
like a movie or I'll write or a bit of

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:02.710
like a movie or I'll write or a bit of
 

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:04.470
like a movie or I'll write or a bit of
writing or anything reviews do need

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:04.480
writing or anything reviews do need
 

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.990
writing or anything reviews do need
pacing so you can't just have everything

00:19:06.990 --> 00:19:07.000
pacing so you can't just have everything
 

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.180
pacing so you can't just have everything
too fast you can have a fast but you

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:09.190
too fast you can have a fast but you
 

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.940
too fast you can have a fast but you
still need it to sink in for people

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:11.950
still need it to sink in for people
 

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:13.590
still need it to sink in for people
unless the joke is that's going so fast

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:13.600
unless the joke is that's going so fast
 

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.270
unless the joke is that's going so fast
you can barely process it but for a

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:15.280
you can barely process it but for a
 

00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.289
you can barely process it but for a
review for like what I'm doing

00:19:17.289 --> 00:19:17.299
review for like what I'm doing
 

00:19:17.299 --> 00:19:19.930
review for like what I'm doing
uh you need to have a good pace and now

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:19.940
uh you need to have a good pace and now
 

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:22.359
uh you need to have a good pace and now
for these scenes I know I'm going to be

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:22.369
for these scenes I know I'm going to be
 

00:19:22.369 --> 00:19:23.710
for these scenes I know I'm going to be
reading this so what I do is that I

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:23.720
reading this so what I do is that I
 

00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:28.180
reading this so what I do is that I
separate the audio from the video and I

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:28.190
separate the audio from the video and I
 

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:29.739
separate the audio from the video and I
pretty much get rid of the video in

00:19:29.739 --> 00:19:29.749
pretty much get rid of the video in
 

00:19:29.749 --> 00:19:32.109
pretty much get rid of the video in
these scenes until I see a moment where

00:19:32.109 --> 00:19:32.119
these scenes until I see a moment where
 

00:19:32.119 --> 00:19:34.029
these scenes until I see a moment where
I know I'm gonna start talking again

00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039
I know I'm gonna start talking again
 

00:19:34.039 --> 00:19:35.830
I know I'm gonna start talking again
like I can see I'm looking at the camera

00:19:35.830 --> 00:19:35.840
like I can see I'm looking at the camera
 

00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:38.229
like I can see I'm looking at the camera
now and throwing my hand up so I know

00:19:38.229 --> 00:19:38.239
now and throwing my hand up so I know
 

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:40.450
now and throwing my hand up so I know
I'm gonna start talking at this point so

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:40.460
I'm gonna start talking at this point so
 

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:43.739
I'm gonna start talking at this point so
here I put the video right back together

00:19:43.739 --> 00:19:43.749
here I put the video right back together
 

00:19:43.749 --> 00:19:47.289
here I put the video right back together
so that this way as you can see now I

00:19:47.289 --> 00:19:47.299
so that this way as you can see now I
 

00:19:47.299 --> 00:19:49.479
so that this way as you can see now I
just have the audio I can play with and

00:19:49.479 --> 00:19:49.489
just have the audio I can play with and
 

00:19:49.489 --> 00:19:52.299
just have the audio I can play with and
that's gonna be much easier to edit than

00:19:52.299 --> 00:19:52.309
that's gonna be much easier to edit than
 

00:19:52.309 --> 00:19:54.039
that's gonna be much easier to edit than
having to black out the video the whole

00:19:54.039 --> 00:19:54.049
having to black out the video the whole
 

00:19:54.049 --> 00:19:55.570
having to black out the video the whole
time so it's easier just to cut the

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:55.580
time so it's easier just to cut the
 

00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:57.700
time so it's easier just to cut the
video out and the way you know if your

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:57.710
video out and the way you know if your
 

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.460
video out and the way you know if your
sound is too loud or not is right here

00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:00.470
sound is too loud or not is right here
 

00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:02.379
sound is too loud or not is right here
and I used to ignore this but I was

00:20:02.379 --> 00:20:02.389
and I used to ignore this but I was
 

00:20:02.389 --> 00:20:04.749
and I used to ignore this but I was
wrong because i had my speakers it was

00:20:04.749 --> 00:20:04.759
wrong because i had my speakers it was
 

00:20:04.759 --> 00:20:06.609
wrong because i had my speakers it was
way too low so i turned the sound up way

00:20:06.609 --> 00:20:06.619
way too low so i turned the sound up way
 

00:20:06.619 --> 00:20:08.919
way too low so i turned the sound up way
too high and it was always distorted and

00:20:08.919 --> 00:20:08.929
too high and it was always distorted and
 

00:20:08.929 --> 00:20:10.869
too high and it was always distorted and
I've learned recently that I have to

00:20:10.869 --> 00:20:10.879
I've learned recently that I have to
 

00:20:10.879 --> 00:20:12.519
I've learned recently that I have to
just keep track of this he just tried to

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:12.529
just keep track of this he just tried to
 

00:20:12.529 --> 00:20:14.710
just keep track of this he just tried to
keep it as little as you can in the red

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:14.720
keep it as little as you can in the red
 

00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.119
keep it as little as you can in the red
so here you'll see it doesn't really go

00:20:16.119 --> 00:20:16.129
so here you'll see it doesn't really go
 

00:20:16.129 --> 00:20:18.460
so here you'll see it doesn't really go
in there as much hello I'm a nostalgia

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:18.470
in there as much hello I'm a nostalgia
 

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:20.259
in there as much hello I'm a nostalgia
critic guy remember it so you don't have

00:20:20.259 --> 00:20:20.269
critic guy remember it so you don't have
 

00:20:20.269 --> 00:20:23.349
critic guy remember it so you don't have
to know but again if you do something

00:20:23.349 --> 00:20:23.359
to know but again if you do something
 

00:20:23.359 --> 00:20:25.989
to know but again if you do something
really crazy like let's say is listening

00:20:25.989 --> 00:20:25.999
really crazy like let's say is listening
 

00:20:25.999 --> 00:20:27.489
really crazy like let's say is listening
to this and I said oh that's way too

00:20:27.489 --> 00:20:27.499
to this and I said oh that's way too
 

00:20:27.499 --> 00:20:29.619
to this and I said oh that's way too
softer and my speaker's turn out too low
