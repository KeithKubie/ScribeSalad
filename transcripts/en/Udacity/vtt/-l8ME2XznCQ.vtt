00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.119
What do you think, David?

00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:02.763
&gt;&gt; So in resolution theorem proving,

00:00:02.763 --> 00:00:05.624
we always assume the opposite
of what we're trying to prove.

00:00:05.624 --> 00:00:07.783
We're doing proof by refutation.

00:00:07.783 --> 00:00:09.436
So we're trying to prove
that it is a bird, so

00:00:09.436 --> 00:00:11.960
we're going to assume
that it's not a bird.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.470
&gt;&gt; That's right.
