00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.100
The artists at Walt Disney Animation may have
traded their pencils and notepads for computers

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.360
and keyboards over the years, but not everything
has changed.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.961
Decades of Disney heroes are too beloved to
be forgotten, which means plenty of Easter

00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:20.890
Eggs, secret cameos, and inside jokes to watch
out for.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:29.130
Here is our list of 10 Hidden Details in Disney
Movies.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:35.070
Frozen

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.710
Long before Anna, Elsa, and Olaf became household
names, the makers of Frozen had a party to

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:40.710
plan.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.079
Being named Queen of Arrendale may have stressed
Elsa out, but it also meant the gates of the

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.370
castle would finally be opened to villagers
and visiting guests.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.620
When Anna finally steps out of the gates,
two arriving villagers should stand out to

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:57.859
Disney fans: Rapunzel and Flynn Rider, the
stars of Disney's Tangled.

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.539
Big Hero 6

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.440
As one of the most successful movies Disney
has ever released, we're willing to bet that

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.280
Easter Eggs and references to Frozen are just
beginning.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.032
The minds behind Big Hero 6 are clearly fans
- and hold a serious grudge against Hans,

00:01:12.032 --> 00:01:15.979
the would-be king who tried to kill both of
Frozen's leading ladies.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.360
A statue of Hans can be seen for just a moment
before Baymax destroys it while trying out

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.539
his new armor.

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:27.840
If that weren't enough, his face can be seen
gracing a Wanted poster in a San Fransokyo

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.329
police station.

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.609
The Little Mermaid

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:37.250
It seems Disney animators never miss a chance
to fill crowd scenes with iconic characters

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.420
from other movies and cartoons, even before
Easter Eggs were mandatory.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.350
When King Triton assembles the underwater
masses in the opening scene of The Little

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.740
Mermaid, eagle-eyed viewers can spot Donald
Duck, Goofy, and Mickey Mouse in the crowd.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.450
And it isn't just Disney mascots who get in
on the fun, either: Kermit the Frog can be

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.340
seen just a few rows behind them.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.399
Lilo &amp; Stitch

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.560
You don't have to be a princess just to star
in a Disney adventure, only willing to don

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.110
a disguise to protect your family - and belt
out a few musical numbers too.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.950
Mulan learned that for herself when she pretended
to be a man to join China's forces against

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.500
the invading Huns in Disney's retelling of
the classic story.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.910
Its message must have struck a chord with
the cast of Lilo and Stitch, since a poster

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.370
of Mulan hangs on Lilo's mother Nani's wall,
and the family even passes a restaurant called

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.810
"Mulan Wok" when first adopting the trouble-making
alien.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.010
Wall-E

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.000
Trading a human or animal star for a robotic
one, Wall-E was a major turning point for

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.810
Pixar as a whole, relying less on dialogue
than ever before.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.470
Set in a future where mankind has turned Earth
into one massive landfill and headed into

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.330
space, Wall-E is just one maintenance robot
left behind.

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.110
He's put his time to good use, too, collecting
dozens of trinkets and souvenirs to store

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.110
in his home.

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.390
When Wall-E first enters his house in the
movie, one Toy Story character can be seen

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.060
hidden behind a pair of bowling pins.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.420
How Rex managed to survive the man-made end
of the world isn't clear, but if he survived,

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.980
then it stands to reason Woody and the gang
were still alive off-screen as well

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.880
The Hunchback of Notre Dame

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.370
Few Disney movies can compete with the number
of cameos tucked into The Hunchback of Notre

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.791
Dame, with the opening scene alone featuring
a vendor selling Aladdin's magic carpet, and

00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.160
Beauty and the Beast's Belle out for a morning
stroll.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.690
The Lion King jokester Pumbaa seems the odd
one out, but his other cameo in the films

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.640
climax is even better: proudly standing guard
as a stone gargoyle.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.440
Brave

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:40.391
When Pixar was made an official branch of
Walt Disney Animation, the tradition of Easter

00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:44.840
Eggs and cameos was just one thing both studios
could agree on - even if it made no sense

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.550
to the story being told.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:49.700
It's strange enough that among the wooden
carvings being sold by the Witch in Brave

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
is the same Pizza Planet delivery truck included
in every Pixar film.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.710
But the carved image of Sully, the furry star
of the wildly successful Monsters, Inc. shows

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.840
that even witches need to worry about what's
hiding in their closet.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:05.290
Beauty and the Beast

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:09.820
One of the best known Pixar Easter Eggs is
the label "A113", the classroom at the California

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.900
Institute of Technology where many of the
company's earlier animators learned their

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.900
trade.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.190
But the California locations are nothing new:
in Beauty and The Beast, Maurice and Felipe

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.530
find themselves lost in a terrifying forest,
with a worn-out signpost offering little help.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.040
But a closer look shows arrows pointing to
both Valencia, where the school is located,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.120
and Anaheim, home to Disneyland.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120
Ratatouille

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.740
In what may be Pixar’s most unconventional
tale to date, Ratatouille follows a rat with

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.090
a flair for the culinary arts, and a young
man named Linguini who hopes to become a great

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.640
chef, but lacks the skills to do it.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.060
The pair realizes success means combining
their talents, but actually working together

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.640
poses a serious challenge.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.220
When Linguini considers smuggling Remy into
the kitchen in his pants, the rat isn’t

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:58.370
on board.

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.790
But the biggest reveal of the scene is Linguini’s
underwear, shown to be patterned with the

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:04.200
logo of Mr. Incredible, the star of The Incredibles.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.710
It’s one more hint that Pixar’s films
all take place in one universe, while also

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.330
showing that superheroes are just as famous
in the fictional world of Pixar as they are

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.330
in our own.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.620
A Dog Eat Dog World

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.130
There's one fact that no one can deny: the
Disney animators are most certainly dog people.

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.930
And what's better than a canine adventure?

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.450
How about a shared universe of them?

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.100
101 Dalmatians has enough spotted dogs in
a single family to worry about, but when the

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.910
call goes out that the pups are in trouble,
Lady and the Tramp can be seen in the city

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.460
streets, along with their canine co-stars
Jock and Peg.

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.580
The litter's father, Pongo also makes a Cameo
in Oliver &amp; Company, along with Jock, Peg,

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.690
and the always loyal Trusty.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:40.940
So what do you think of our list?
