anymore it arises and it passes away and
 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.410
anymore it arises and it passes away and
if it comes back in the present moment

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420

by virtue of your thinking about it
 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.030
by virtue of your thinking about it
again it will subside again when you're

again it will subside again when you're
 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.170
again it will subside again when you're
no longer thinking about it now that

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180
no longer thinking about it now that
 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.750
no longer thinking about it now that
this is something that people tend not

this is something that people tend not
 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.630
this is something that people tend not
to notice because because we rather than

merely feel an emotion like anger we
 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.120
merely feel an emotion like anger we
spend our time thinking of all the

reasons why we have every right to be
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.360
reasons why we have every right to be
angry and so and so the conversation

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370
angry and so and so the conversation
 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.540
angry and so and so the conversation
keeps this emotion in play for much much

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550
keeps this emotion in play for much much
 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.580
keeps this emotion in play for much much
longer than it would then it's a natural
