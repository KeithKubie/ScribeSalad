00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.030
I've talked a lot about the
importance of hemoglobin in

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.130
our red blood cells so I thought
I would dedicate an

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.340
entire video to hemoglobin.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.210
One-- because it's important,
but also it explains a lot

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.410
about how the hemoglobin-- or
the red blood cells, depending

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.110
on what level you want to
operate-- know, and I have to

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.050
use know in quotes.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
These aren't sentient beings,
but how do they know when to

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.060
pick up the oxygen and when
to drop off the oxygen?

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.790
So this right here, this is
actually a picture of a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.710
hemoglobin protein.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.790
It's made up of four
amino acid chains.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.430
That's one of them.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:41.770
Those are the other two.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.010
We're not going to go into the
detail of that, but these look

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.200
like little curly ribbons.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.300
If you imagine them, they're a
bunch of molecules and amino

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.220
acids and then they're curled
around like that.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.590
So this on some level
describes its shape.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.140
And in each of those groups or
in each of those chains, you

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.110
have a heme group
here in green.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.420
That's where you get the
hem in hemoglobin from.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.870
You have four heme groups and
the globins are essentially

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:11.150
describing the rest of it-- the
protein structures, the

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.310
four peptide chains

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.100
Now, this heme group-- this
is pretty interesting.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.860
It actually is a porphyrin
structure.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.790
And if you watch the video on
chlorophyll, you'd remember a

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.890
porphyrin structure, but at
the very center of it, in

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.670
chlorophyll, we had a magnesium
ion, but at the very

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.440
center of hemoglobin, we have an
iron ion and this is where

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.720
the oxygen binds.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.810
So on this hemoglobin, you have
four major binding sites

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:39.370
for oxygen.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.540
You have right there, maybe
right there, a little bit

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.660
behind, right there,
and right there.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.510
Now why is hemoglobin-- oxygen
will bind very well here, but

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.440
hemoglobin has a several
properties that one, make it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.720
really good at binding oxygen
and then also really good at

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.240
dumping oxygen when it
needs to dump oxygen.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.905
So it exhibits something called
cooperative binding.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.270
And this is just the principle
that once it binds to one

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.450
oxygen molecule-- let's say
one oxygen molecule binds

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.710
right there-- it changes the
shape in such a way that the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.750
other sites are more likely
to bind oxygen.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.450
So it just makes it-- one
binding makes the other

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.700
bindings more likely.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.300
Now you say, OK, that's fine.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.130
That makes it a very good oxygen
acceptor, when it's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.160
traveling through the pulmonary
capillaries and

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.310
oxygen is diffusing
from the alveoli.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.590
That makes it really good at
picking up the oxygen, but how

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.420
does it know when to
dump the oxygen?

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.680
This is an interesting
question.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:10.050
It doesn't have eyes or some
type of GPS system that says,

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.050
this guy's running right now and
so he's generating a lot

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:17.710
of carbon dioxide right now in
these capillaries and he needs

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.290
a lot of oxygen in these
capillaries surrounding his

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.280
quadriceps.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.095
I need to deliver oxygen.

00:03:22.095 --> 00:03:23.840
It doesn't know it's
in the quadraceps.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.470
How does the hemoglobin know to
let go of the oxygen there?

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.510
And that's a byproduct of what
we call allosteric inhibition,

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.100
which is a very fancy word,
but the concept's actually

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.350
pretty straightforward.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.880
When you talk about allosteric
anything-- it's often using

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.170
the context of enzymes-- you're
talking about the idea

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.460
that things bind
to other parts.

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.550
Allo means other.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.260
So you're binding to other parts
of the protein or the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.660
enzyme-- and enzymes are just
proteins-- and it affects the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:02.310
ability of the protein
or the enzyme to do

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.750
what it normally does.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.430
So hemoglobin is allosterically
inhibited by

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:13.500
carbon dioxide and by protons.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.230
So carbon dioxide can bond
to other parts of the

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.540
hemoglobin-- I don't
know the exact

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.490
spots-- and so can protons.

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:21.640
So remember, acidity
just means a high

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.930
concentration of protons.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.760
So if you're in an acidic
environment, protons can bond.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.470
Maybe I'll do the protons
in this pink color.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.970
Protons-- which are just
hydrogen without electrons,

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.200
right-- protons can bond to
certain parts of our protein

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.370
and it makes it harder for them
to hold onto the oxygen.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.730
So when you're in the presence
of a lot of carbon dioxide or

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.740
an acidic environment, this
thing is going to let go of

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.730
its oxygen.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:50.650
And it just happens to be that
that's a really good time to

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.680
let go of your oxygen.

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.340
Let's go back to this
guy running.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.900
There's a lot of activity in
these cells right here in his

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.460
quadriceps.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.420
They're releasing a lot of
carbon dioxide into the

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.310
capillaries.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.390
At that point, they're going
from arteries into veins and

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.930
they need a lot of oxygen, which
is a great time for the

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:13.900
hemoglobin to dump
their oxygen.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.560
So it's really good that
hemoglobin is allosterically

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.780
inhibited by carbon dioxide.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.490
Carbon dioxide joins on
certain parts of it.

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:24.720
It starts letting go of its
oxygen, that's exactly where

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.700
in the body the oxygen
is needed.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:27.360
Now you're saying, wait.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.030
What about this acidic
environment?

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.350
How does this come into play?

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.990
Well, it turns out that most
of the carbon dioxide is

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.260
actually disassociated.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.440
It actually disassociates.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.970
It does go into the plasma, but
it actually gets turned

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:40.410
into carbonic acid.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.590
So I'll just write a little
formula right here.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.870
So if you have some CO2 and you
mix it with the water-- I

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.070
mean, most of our blood, the
plasma-- it's water.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.880
So you take some carbon dioxide,
you mix it with

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.960
water, and you have it in the
presence of an enzyme-- and

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.155
this enzyme exists in
red blood cells.

00:06:02.155 --> 00:06:03.940
It's called carbonic
anhydrase.

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:14.310
A reaction will occur--
essentially you'll end up with

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.590
carbonic acid.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:17.840
We have H2CO3.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:21.260
It's all balanced.

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.670
We have three oxygens, two
hydrogens, one carbon.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.700
It's called carbonic acid
because it gives away hydrogen

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.750
protons very easily.

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:34.020
Acids disassociate into their
conjugate base and hydrogen

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:35.200
protons very easily.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.200
So carbonic acid disassociates
very easily.

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:43.340
It's an acid, although I'll
write in some type of an

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.910
equilibrium right there.

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.500
If any of this notation really
confuses you or you want more

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.680
detail on it, watch some of the
chemistry videos on acid

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.180
disassociation and equilibrium
reactions and all of that, but

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.540
it essentially can give away
one of these hydrogens, but

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.940
just the proton and it keeps the
electron of that hydrogen

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.210
so you're left with a hydrogen
proton plus-- well, you gave

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.700
away one of the hydrogens so
you just have one hydrogen.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.680
This is actually a
bicarbonate ion.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:13.760
But it only gave away the
proton, kept the electron so

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:15.130
you have a minus sign.

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:18.900
So all of the charge adds up to
neutral and that's neutral

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:19.700
over there.

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.930
So if I'm in a capillary
of the leg-- let me see

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.640
if I can draw this.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.890
So let's say I'm in the
capillary of my leg.

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:30.650
Let me do a neutral color.

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.410
So this is a capillary
of my leg.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.420
I've zoomed in just one
part of the capillary.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.080
It's always branching off.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:41.490
And over here, I have a bunch
of muscle cells right here

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.000
that are generating a lot
of carbon dioxide

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.580
and they need oxygen.

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:50.440
Well, what's going to happen?

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.340
Well, I have my red blood
cells flowing along.

00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:57.750
It's actually interesting--
red blood cells-- their

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:01.280
diameter's 25% larger than
the smallest capillaries.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.370
So essentially they get squeezed
as they go through

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.550
the small capillaries, which a
lot of people believe helps

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.810
them release their contents and
maybe some of the oxygen

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:11.870
that they have in them.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.010
So you have a red blood cell
that's coming in here.

00:08:14.010 --> 00:08:18.180
It's being squeezed through
this capillary right here.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.130
It has a bunch of hemoglobin--
and when I say a bunch, you

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:25.800
might as well know right now,
each red blood cell has 270

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.240
million hemoglobin proteins.

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.169
And if you total up the
hemoglobin in the entire body,

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:38.080
it's huge because
we have 20 to 30

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.670
trillion red blood cells.

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:49.820
And each of those 20 to 30
trillion red blood cells have

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:55.330
270 million hemoglobin
proteins in them.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.880
So we have a lot
of hemoglobin.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.410
So anyway, that was a little
bit of a-- so actually, red

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.240
blood cells make up roughly
25% of all of the

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.080
cells in our body.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.730
We have about 100 trillion
or a little bit

00:09:04.730 --> 00:09:05.920
more, give or take.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.910
I've never sat down
and counted them.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:11.980
But anyway, we have 270 million
hemoglobin particles

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.950
or proteins in each red blood
cell-- explains why the red

00:09:14.950 --> 00:09:18.100
blood cells had to shed their
nucleuses to make space for

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.370
all those hemoglobins.

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:21.510
They're carrying oxygen.

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:24.730
So right here we're dealing
with-- this

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:26.410
is an artery, right?

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.610
It's coming from the heart.

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:29.870
The red blood cell is going in
that direction and then it's

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:32.100
going to shed its oxygen
and then it's

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.080
going to become a vein.

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:38.640
Now what's going to happen is
you have this carbon dioxide.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:41.390
You have a high concentration
of carbon dioxide in the

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:41.880
muscle cell.

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:45.530
It eventually, just by diffusion
gradient, ends up--

00:09:45.530 --> 00:09:52.770
let me do that same color-- ends
up in the blood plasma

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:55.760
just like that and some of it
can make its way across the

00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:00.220
membrane into the actual
red blood cell.

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.680
In the red blood cell, you have
this carbonic anhydrase

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.770
which makes the carbon dioxide
disassociate into-- or

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:09.900
essentially become carbonic
acid, which

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.370
then can release protons.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:18.700
Well, those protons, we just
learned, can allosterically

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:22.250
inhibit the uptake of oxygen
by hemoglobin.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.040
So those protons start bonding
to different parts and even

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:27.650
the carbon dioxide that hasn't
been reacted with-- that can

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.840
also allosterically inhibit
the hemoglobin.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.630
So it also bonds
to other parts.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:36.730
And that changes the shape of
the hemoglobin protein just

00:10:36.730 --> 00:10:39.370
enough that it can't hold onto
its oxygens that well and it

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:40.640
starts letting go.

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.230
And just as we said we had
cooperative binding, the more

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.180
oxygens you have on, the better
it is at accepting

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.480
more-- the opposite happens.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.720
When you start letting go of
oxygen, it becomes harder to

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.540
retain the other ones.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.260
So then all of the
oxygens let go.

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:55.410
So this, at least in my mind,
it's a brilliant, brilliant

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.910
mechanism because the oxygen
gets let go just where it

00:10:58.910 --> 00:10:59.735
needs to let go.

00:10:59.735 --> 00:11:05.760
It doesn't just say, I've
left an artery and

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.980
I'm now in a vein.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:09.050
Maybe I've gone through some
capillaries right here and I'm

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:10.080
going to go back to a vein.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.920
Let me release my oxygen--
because then it would just

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.180
release the oxygen willy-nilly
throughout the body.

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:17.110
This system, by being
allosterically inhibited by

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.570
carbon dioxide and an acidic
environment, it allows it to

00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.730
release it where it is most
needed, where there's the most

00:11:23.730 --> 00:11:28.570
carbon dioxide, where
respiration is occurring most

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:29.870
vigorously.

00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.550
So it's a fascinating,
fascinating scheme.

00:11:32.550 --> 00:11:34.540
And just to get a better
understanding of it, right

00:11:34.540 --> 00:11:37.520
here I have this little chart
right here that shows the

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:40.740
oxygen uptake by hemoglobin or
how saturated it can be.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:43.560
And you might see this in maybe
your biology class so

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.590
it's a good thing
to understand.

00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:48.890
So right here, we have on the
x-axis or the horizontal axis,

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:51.450
we have the partial pressure
of oxygen.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.180
And if you watched the chemistry
lectures on partial

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.350
pressure, you know that partial
pressure just means,

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.990
how frequently are you being
bumped into by oxygen?

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:03.480
Pressure is generated by gases
or molecules bumping into you.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.300
It doesn't have to be gas,
but just molecules

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:06.310
bumping into you.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:09.390
And then the partial pressure
of oxygen is the amount of

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:11.310
that that's generated
by oxygen molecules

00:12:11.310 --> 00:12:11.990
bumping into you.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:14.370
So you can imagine as you go
to the right, there's just

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.160
more and more oxygen around so
you're going to get more and

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.930
more bumped into by oxygen.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.510
So this is just essentially
saying, how much oxygen is

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.590
around as you go to
the right axis?

00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:27.550
And then the vertical axis tells
you, how saturated are

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:29.150
your hemoglobin molecules?

00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:33.610
This 100% would mean all of the
heme groups on all of the

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:37.980
hemoglobin molecules or proteins
have bound to oxygen.

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:41.280
Zero means that none have. So
when you have an environment

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.630
with very little oxygen-- and
this actually shows the

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:48.060
cooperative binding-- so let's
say we're just dealing with an

00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:49.960
environment with very
little oxygen.

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:53.410
So once a little bit of oxygen
binds, then it makes it even

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:56.200
more likely that more and
more oxygen will bind.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.840
As soon as a little-- that's why
the slope is increasing.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.220
I don't want to go into algebra
and calculus here, but

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.900
as you see, we're kind
of flattish, and

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.550
then the slope increases.

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:06.990
So as we bind to some oxygen,
it makes it more likely that

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:07.605
we'll bind to more.

00:13:07.605 --> 00:13:12.420
And at some point, it's hard for
oxygens to bump just right

00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:14.730
into the right hemoglobin
molecules, but you can see

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.040
that it kind of accelerates
right around here.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:21.620
Now, if we have an acidic
environment that has a lot of

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.350
carbon dioxide so that the
hemoglobin is allosterically

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:27.190
inhibited, it's not going
to be as good at this.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:31.830
So in an acidic environment,
this curve for any level of

00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.620
oxygen partial pressure or any
amount of oxygen, we're going

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.990
to have less bound hemoglobin.

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.140
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.110
So then the curve would
look like this.

00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:46.930
The saturation curve will
look like this.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.360
So this is an acidic
environment.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.410
Maybe there's some carbon
dioxide right here.

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:06.300
So the hemoglobin is being
allosterically inhibited so

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.820
it's more likely to dump the
oxygen at this point.

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.300
So I don't know.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.250
I don't know how exciting you
found that, but I find it

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:15.450
brilliant because it really is
the simplest way for these

00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:17.480
things to dump their oxygen
where needed.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.080
No GPS needed, no robots needed
to say, I'm now in the

00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.610
quadriceps and the
guy is running.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.415
Let me dump my oxygen.

00:14:24.415 --> 00:14:26.410
It just does it naturally
because it's a more acidic

00:14:26.410 --> 00:14:28.180
environment with more
carbon dioxide.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.120
It gets inhibited and then the
oxygen gets dumped and ready

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.070
to use for respiration.
