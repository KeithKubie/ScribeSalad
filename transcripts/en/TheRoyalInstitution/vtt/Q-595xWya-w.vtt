00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.250
Please welcome chimpanzee researcher from
the university of St. Andrews,

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:20.820
Doctor Cat Hobaiter.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.460
Hello. Lovely to meet you.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.600
So you've been asking some really interesting
questions about ape language

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.480
and can you tell us more about your work.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.710
Yeah, absolutely. So what people had done
in the past was

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.450
try to teach apes our language. So human language
or sign language.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.300
Or they'd looked at their vocalisations,

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.940
but what we've been looking at is their gestures.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940
OK.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.760
And it turns out that they've got a lot of
different gestures,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.210
so their own natural communication contains

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.440
60 or 70 different hand and body movements
that they're using every day to ask -

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.540
come here, go away, I want that, all the little
meanings.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.250
And how do you work out what those gestures
mean?

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:13.159
What we do is we look for a particular gesture
and then we're looking for what happens next.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.030
And if I were to do this and you responded
back to me,

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.909
one or two cases it could be anything or you
could misunderstand me,

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.380
or I could keep going, but what I'm looking
for is what stops me from signalling.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.990
So if I'm asking you for something then the
thing

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.049
that you do that makes me happy

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200
as I signal it is the thing that I wanted.

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.380
Yeah, yeah so you have to get the whole context.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.259
So we need to look at the signaller, at the
recipient, at the gesture,

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.030
and then we need to look at not just one or
two but hundreds of cases

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.240
so we can see the patterns emerging in the
behaviour.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.619
And you've been using the general public

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.800
to help you with your research as well, haven't
you?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.139
Yep. So we were able over a few years to look
at all of the other apes

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620
but there was one of them missing which was
us.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.200
And we know we have language but we don't
know if we still have access

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.770
to some of the communication that the apes
also use.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.130
The sort of gestural stuff they're using.
- Exactly.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.150
So whether or not if we showed a member of
the public a particular gesture,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.222
could they guess what it meant.

00:02:13.222 --> 00:02:17.560
And what we did was put up lots of videos
online and ask everyone to come along

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.430
and sort of play the game and have a go.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.540
Can we have a go at it now.
- Yes, please.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.481
Fantastic. So we've got a clip to start with.

00:02:23.481 --> 00:02:25.659
We're going to watch this closely, because
we're going to ask you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.740
what you think is going on.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.760
So the gesture there was that kind of arm.
- The little arm raise from Charlotte.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.840
And it's from, is that a baby?
- Yes, she's just a little one.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.370
So do we think that's A - I want that
B - Move closer

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.200
or C - Go away

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.460
Audience: B

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.820
Yep, you guys are all well versed in chimpanzee
already that was "move closer".

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.720
OK, can we try another one?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.760
We're just highlighting this because it happens
very quickly.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.430
Yeah, this is a really subtle one. So it's
just that little foot movement

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.010
as she looks back and gives a little foot
wiggle to her son.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.939
Is that: play with me?
Climb on me?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:23.939
or come here?

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.720
Audience: B!
- B, yeah.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.400
It's rather sweet that one, very very swift.
Really subtle.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.980
So this is really fascinating. It does look
like you're seeing a sign language.

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:37.299
You're seeing really gestural use of communication.

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:39.840
They're not just waving their arms around
passionately,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.640
there's very precise meaning being conveyed
here.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.540
But of course the real power of human language
is

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.950
that we can combine our words and symbols
into sequences.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.920
And that gives us a more complex level of
meaning. Can the chimps ever do this?

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.530
Do you ever see any kind of examples of sequences?

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.420
Definitely. So what we see sometimes are these
one off gestures

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.800
but they will also put gestures together.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.720
Sometimes a couple at once.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.500
That was a big scratch and a shaking the object.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.000
And he's actually waiting there and whatever
that gesture was

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.209
it doesn't seem to have done the trick because
Rohara is ignoring him.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.912
So he's going to do that again.
- He's doing it again and this time...

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.780
The arm comes up. So we've got a scratch,
a tree wiggle and the arm going up.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.120
And it worked. Oh alright then, I'll get down.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.780
She's a bit of an old lady.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.000
So the tree waving is the sort of "come here,
I'm in charge". The scratching?

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000
The scratching usually means groom, let's
groom, let's get together and groom.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.290
Our big question for us now is when they're
putting these gestures into sequences.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.670
If it was human words, the order of the sequence

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.250
would make a difference to the meaning,

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.370
and we're trying to work out now if that's
the same for the chimps.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.600
Amazing. Thank you so much, Cat, thank you.
