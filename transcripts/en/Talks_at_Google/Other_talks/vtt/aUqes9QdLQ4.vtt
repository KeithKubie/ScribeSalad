00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.920
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: For those of you who know
Kevin, he needs no introduction.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.440
For those of you that don't some have called
him the world's most famous computer hacker.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.020
He's had several books written about him,
a movie made about him.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.630
He's the author of several books, with a new
one that came out this week which is a tell-all.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.590
His story in short is I'll leave the details
to you but he basically hacked into several

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:40.570
Fortune 500 companies, government agencies,
phone companies and spent three years on the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.200
run and then finally got caught and spent
five years behind bars.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
So with that, a warm welcome to Kevin Mitnick.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
[applause]

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.080
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Thank you Eran.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:58.280
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So I mean how does one
become the world's most famous computer hacker?

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.660
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Wow, that takes a lot of,
a lot of doing.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.010
Actually I started as a 10-year old I was
fascinated with magic and I loved doing magic

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.010
tricks.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.201
And then in high school I was introduced to
a student who could do magic with the telephone

00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.201
system.

00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.950
And he's what they called a phone freak.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.530
And if you, I don't know how many of you read
2600 Magazine.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.770
So you've got a few of you in here.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.960
So phone phreaking was like the predecessor
to hacking and, and I was just like taken

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.170
aback with what this kid could do.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.200
I, I gave him my mom's name and he was able
to get our unlisted telephone number at home.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.679
I, I, he gave me this special number that
you would call, you'd call this secret number

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:42.139
and you'd hear like a weird tone, you'd put
in five digits and then you can call anywhere

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:43.380
in the world for free.

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.570
Not that I had to call anyone, but I liked
calling the time in Australia because I thought

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.759
it was cool.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.869
And at the time I thought it was a fluke with
the telephone system, but it actually probably

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.990
was some poor soul's MCI account and just
all the cool stuff he could do with the phone.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.619
So I was a prankster and I loved pulling cool
tricks, so the first thing that I did was

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.979
I changed a friend's class of service to that
of a pay phone, so whenever he or his parents

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.770
tried to make a call, it would say, "Please
deposit a dime."

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:09.770
[laughter]

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.200
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: 'Cause they'd actually get
this recording, I actually have the recording

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.360
in my iPhone.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.400
So you imagine you're, you're at the, you're
at home, you go to make a call, and this is

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.400
what you hear:

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.650
[recording starts] The call you have made
requires a ten cent deposit.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.650
[laughter]

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.220
[recording continues] Please hang on momentarily.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.260
Listen for dial tone.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.070
Deposit ten cents and dial your call again.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.070
[recording ends]

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.380
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And so I was really like
into pulling pranks with the telephone system

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.780
and that was my passion was really just to
learn all about telephony.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.380
And, and then when the phone companies started
switching over to electronic switching systems,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.140
that's when they had front end computers that
were involved and that's why I became interested

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.140
in hacking.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.150
Actually, I did, I wasn't really, I didn't
even want to go to learn about computers.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.880
I had a friend in high school that says, "Hey
you would really love computer class."

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.860
And, and then I talked to the instructor and
I said, "Hey, I'd like to take a computer

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:03.860
class."

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.390
And he asked me what my prerequisites you
know what, what classes I had done before

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.510
and I didn't have calculus and I didn't have
some other prerequisites, so he says I couldn't

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.510
get it.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.440
So then I said, then my friend was there and
he goes, "Show him some of the tricks you

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.600
can do with the telephone."

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.900
And then ok, we're gonna let you in, we're
gonna waive the prerequisites.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.690
And probably that was, probably he's regretting
that today, [audience laughs] 'cause of all

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.320
the crazy stuff I did.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:34.230
I mean the first thing I used to do was like
dial up to USC so I could play their computer

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.710
games, because they were, they had better
games than they did in high school, and they

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.930
had an Olivetti terminal, a decoustacoupler
110 baud modem, so you can imagine 110 baud.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.200
Any of you have, have computed at those, dialed
up at those super fast speeds?

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.660
Well, in any event, I dialed, they had a phone
in the room, so it was restricted, you couldn't

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:57.660
dial out.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.000
So what I used to do is call the operator
and say, "Hi, this is Mr. Crist.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.190
I need you to connect me to this number.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.500
And that would be the dial up for SC.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.960
So after he figured out what was going on
because all the kids in class were playing

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.390
computer games on USC's computers because
they actually had a much better gaming library,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.770
he brought in a phone lock.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.110
And he says, "I found the one thing that's
gonna stop Kevin from dialing up to USC.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.280
He proudly places the phone lock in the one,
you know 'cause it's a rotary phone and number

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280
one.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.020
And I go, "Hey, that's cool, how much did
that cost you?"

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.690
And he goes, "Oh like five, six, seven bucks."

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.590
And I said, "Let me show you a cool trick."

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:36.210
So of course I asked him for a phone number
and I just simply pulsed out on the switch

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.350
hook, you know, the number I wanted to dial.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.240
His face turns red and he actually threw the
phone across the room.

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
[laughter]

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:45.310
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: You were quite, quite the
prankster anyhow.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:49.480
I mean most kids you know in their adolescent
days go you know toilet papering houses.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.690
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.140
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: You had your other--

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.883
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Mine was electronics, you
know.

00:04:54.883 --> 00:04:56.150
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So tell us like the McDonald's
story, I mean.

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.310
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, my God, that's kind of
my favorite hack of all time is taking over

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.740
the drive-up window at McDonald's.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.740
[laughter]

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:10.930
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So you could imagine the
fun you could have at 16, 17 years old.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.300
I used to sit, my friends and I would sit
like across a busy street in Los Angeles,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.811
I don't know if you know the area, it's like
Ventura Boulevard, it's like a huge, it's

00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:22.710
huge, it's like Broadway here.

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:28.090
And when customers would drive up, I had a
ham radio that I modified that I can go on,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.880
I can go on McDonald's frequencies so I could
actually take over the drive-up window.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.860
So the guy with the headset inside, he could
hear what's going on, right, but was powerless

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.860
to do anything.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.010
So people would drive forward, you know, I'd
take their order, you know, they'd ask for

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.490
a Big Mac, large fry, large coke.

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.360
I'd say, "Hey, man, we don't serve burgers
here anymore, you have to go down to Taco

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.360
Bell."

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.360
[laughter]

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.360
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: You know and stuff like that.

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.680
But the better one is when the cops drove
up.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.870
'Cause I'd see the cops car and I'd go, "Oh,
hide the cocaine, hide the cocaine."

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.870
[laughter]

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:05.510
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And then you know 16, 17
you're a little bit immature, so

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.370
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: You think?

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.020
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Just a little, so a customer'd
drive up, place their order.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:16.490
You know "I'm sorry sir, our ice machine's
broken, but in lieu of sodas we're giving

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:20.600
out free apple juice and would you like small,
medium or large?"

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.199
And they'd always say large, right, 'cause
it's free and then we had a recording of what

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.590
sounded like urinating in a cup.

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:28.010
[applause and laughter from the audience]

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.330
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: "Would you please drive forward,
sir?"

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.919
You know and of course the one time it got
too much for the guy, the manager at McDonald's,

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:42.480
and he comes, he's out of the store, he's
walking around the parking lot looking to

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.360
every car, to see who the culprit is.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.650
He sees nothing, 'cause we're way across the
street.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.480
And we're kind of laughing, we're sitting
there laughing.

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.610
And then he, he walks up to the drive-up window
speaker and he places his head in the speaker

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:57.120
like he's gonna see something.

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:05.070
Of course I couldn't resist, I press down
the microphone, "What the fuck you looking

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:06.070
at?"

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.070
[laughter]

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.070
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And this guy, he flew back
like 25 feet, right?

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:12.919
So that's actually my favorite hack, is McDonald's,
so.

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:17.340
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: But earlier on, right,
you got caught even for, for some of those

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.340
hacks, right?

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.479
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Not for McDonald's, I got,
I got, my first time really in trouble was

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:27.800
we went dumpster diving at a Pacific Bell
building and then we, I decided to see if

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.000
we could social engineer our way inside because
we were very interested in the system at the

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.750
phone company called Cosmos.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:38.610
And our objective there was just to go in
there and like look at the manuals, try to

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:40.440
see if we can get a few passwords.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.530
But we went a little overboard.

00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.140
We decided we're gonna take some manuals out,
copy them, and return them, but since it was

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.140
so late at night

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.140
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Return them to the dumpster?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.570
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: No, we actually got into
the building and that's what I got in trouble,

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.300
you know, obviously, you know.

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:59.830
And we tried to return them, but then we were
afraid to go back, so ended up getting into

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:00.830
hot water for that.

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:03.410
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: What kind of hot water
did you get into?

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:07.970
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, well, like arrested.

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.080
[laughing] Actually because somebody told
on, one of the friends of a friend told on

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:15.550
us and ended up, it's all in Ghost in the
Wires.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:22.570
It was like, I mean I remember when the police
pulled me over, I was working at, in the San

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:26.510
Fernando Valley, is one of the District Attorney
actually showed up.

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.560
And actually he's kind of a friend of mine
now, Stephen Cooley, he's now the District

00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:34.669
Attorney in Los Angeles County and he's yelling
to the guys, "Search the car for a logic bomb,

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:36.399
search the car for a logic bomb."

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:40.050
Because he thought it was like an explos-,
an IE, you know an explosive device, when

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:41.370
they didn't know it was a piece of code.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.070
So that was kind of like ok.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:44.070
[laughter]

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.830
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: [laughing] So what.

00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:49.890
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: But other than the final
big arrest, you, you've had several run ins

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:50.890
with the law.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:52.160
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Unfortunately, yes.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.260
I mean I was so, I was so passionate with
hacking it came to be like a somewhat of an

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.330
obsession for me.

00:08:57.330 --> 00:09:02.481
And it wasn't about stealing money or causing
damage or writing viruses or worms, it was

00:09:02.481 --> 00:09:08.510
really about the, the thrill of getting in
and this thrill was you know overpowering

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.050
my, my common sense.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:16.399
And I ended up getting into, into some trouble
like, and then, then I started playing cat

00:09:16.399 --> 00:09:18.100
and mouse with the government.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.301
And at one point I, I knew that the federal
government was investigating me, so what I

00:09:23.301 --> 00:09:27.750
did is I hacked into the cellular phone company
at the time because back in those times you

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:34.390
had wire line and wireless and I found the
cell phones that belonged to the FBI agents

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:38.490
that were like watching me, so I decided I
would watch them.

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.540
So I had real time access to the CDRs to the
call detail records so I can kind of see who

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.870
they're calling, who's calling them, where
they physically were.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:52.300
And then at one point I, I had this device
that could monitor the cell site in my local

00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:55.310
area and it would monitor the data channel.

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:59.810
And this was on AMPS, this is not an AMPS,
this is not GSM, this is the AMP system.

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.160
And anytime you pass into a cell site, your
phone registers.

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:07.640
Anytime you get a call it does a page and
this is on the old AMP system.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.330
So I had all these FBI cell phone numbers
and I put 'em into my computer.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:15.760
Ok, so you had a scanner that's listening
to the control channel, interfaced into this

00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:20.200
special box to a piece of software, so I can
simply program in the list of phone numbers

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:25.060
and if those phone numbers ever register in
that cell site, it alerts me.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:26.800
So one morning I go to work.

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:28.560
I was working as a private investigator.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:29.560
I go into work.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.820
I put--&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Do we see the irony
there?

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.820
[laughter]

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.950
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I go into work, I put
in the code to disable the alarm to the office

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:40.690
and I still hear this beeping sound and I
hear beep, beep, beep.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.470
And I started walking in the hall towards
my office and it's getting louder.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:45.430
And I go what the hell's going on?

00:10:45.430 --> 00:10:47.160
Did somebody bug my office?

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:50.880
And I'm going to the, and then I finally go
up to the computer and it's actually the alarm,

00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.209
my FBI alarm, that there was an agent in the
area, so I, I realized it was like the main

00:10:56.209 --> 00:11:02.460
guy that was like hunting for me and I realized
that he actually called a pay phone across

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:03.980
the street from the apartment I was at.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:09.310
Now I slept home, I was there at the time,
so I knew, well, they didn't come to arrest

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:10.350
me, did they come to follow me?

00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:14.649
And then I thought, oh, maybe they came to
search.

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:19.480
So, you know, of course I cleaned up my apartment
and 'cause I didn't want to leave anything

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:25.600
there they'd be interested in and then the
next day I thought to go to Winchell's Donuts.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:30.330
So I got a big box of donuts and I wrote "FBI
Donuts" on it and put it in the refrigerator

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:31.330
with a note

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:32.330
[laughter]

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.100
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: with a note on the refrigerator
that I had donuts for them.

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:37.950
So the next day they actually came and searched
and they were pretty unhappy.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:38.950
[laughter]

00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:39.950
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Did they take any donuts?

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.980
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: They didn't eat any donuts
though.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.980
I don't know why.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:44.050
Maybe they thought I poisoned them or something.

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:49.700
So as a kid I just did these like you know
crazy things, you know.

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.700
I was mostly interested in hacking telephone
systems, really as a trophy.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.390
So I'd like try to compromise switches in
all these different areas just to see if I

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.390
could do it.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.080
It wasn't really and to pull pranks.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.390
And then, then I started moving on, I wanted
to learn about how to become a better hacker,

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:12.960
so I would get access to source code, like
VMS source code, you know, that DEC had developed,

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.420
so that I could analyze it for security vulnerabilities,
so I could find holes that would make me more

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.870
adept at compromising those systems.

00:12:19.870 --> 00:12:23.960
So it was more like hacking into the companies,
get the source code, leverage the information

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.459
to become a better hacker.

00:12:25.459 --> 00:12:26.459
Yeah.

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:30.000
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: But in reading the book,
earlier on you also took interest in creating

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.060
false identities, almost like you knew what
was coming on.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.860
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well not really, this is
when I was 11 years old.

00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:38.640
I always liked to know things that you shouldn't
know.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.550
And there was this book

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.550
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Keep an eye on him.

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:42.550
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.709
There was this bookstore in Los Angeles called
the Survival Bookstore and they had books

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:52.649
on lock picking, on creating new identities,
I mean just all the secret underground stuff

00:12:52.649 --> 00:12:54.459
and then they actually sold lock pick sets.

00:12:54.459 --> 00:12:59.140
And I remember you had to be 18 years or older
to buy a lock pick set, so one of the books

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:03.000
that I bought at the Survival Bookstore showed
where you could mail away and get a false

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.410
I.D. that said you're 18.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:05.410
I'm 12.

00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:06.920
So I get a false I.D. that I'm 18.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.430
I go to the lady at the same store and I go,
"Oh, I'm 18."

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:12.530
She looks at it.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:13.530
She laughs.

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:14.530
She goes, "Ok, Kevin."

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:15.530
[laughing]

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:16.530
[laughter]

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:17.530
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Guess who got a lock pick
set?

00:13:17.530 --> 00:13:22.570
But, so I learned like at a very young age
of how the system works and the holes in it.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.080
There's this book called The Paper Trip by
a guy named Barry Reed that described how

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:30.959
to create new identity in America and disappear.

00:13:30.959 --> 00:13:33.720
So I, I, but I never expected I'd have to
use it later.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.140
I just wanted to know how.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:37.390
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So when, when did you start
using that knowledge?

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:44.180
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, when I, in about 1992,
right after the FBI donuts thing.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:45.180
[laughing]

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:50.190
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: And one of the first identities
that you picked was Erik Weisz.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:55.490
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yes, Erik Weisz because my,
you know, my idol at the time was a man named

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:01.050
Harry Houdini and his real name was Erik Weisz,
so at the time I was living in Denver, Colorado,

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:06.089
and I had to get a job, you know, because
I was running from the government at the time

00:14:06.089 --> 00:14:11.019
and I had to get a job and I needed a legitimate
identity, so I chose Erik Weisz.

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:14.410
And I found out later, you know I had a sense
of humor, but much later I found out the FBI

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.180
had no sense of humor.

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:21.120
So this is when I did like one of the, you
know one of the attacks that I discussed in

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.930
the book was on Motorola.

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:24.930
And I

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.930
[laughter]

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:31.030
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And I forgot to bring something,
I just remembered, I wish I could've shown

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:34.480
you the brochure for this thing called the
Microtek Ultralight.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.920
And this thing was like the iPhone of today.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.200
This device, I don't know if you remember,
these like Star Trek type flip phone cell

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.149
phones and as a hacker I wanted to understand
how it worked.

00:14:44.149 --> 00:14:49.649
I wanted to know, you know, the internal protocols,
how the, you know, the firmware was put together,

00:14:49.649 --> 00:14:54.260
so I made a very stupid and regrettable decision,
I decided to go after the source code for

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.630
the handset.

00:14:55.630 --> 00:14:59.230
So one afternoon I left the office early in
Denver.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:03.820
I called the toll-free number, you know for
800 directory assistance.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:05.230
And I asked for Motorola.

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:06.910
And I was given the number.

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:10.280
And I called the number and got a receptionist
and I said, "Hey, I'm looking for the project

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.610
manager of the Microtek Ultralight project."

00:15:13.610 --> 00:15:20.079
And a nice lady told me that all the cellular
development was handled out of Schaumburg,

00:15:20.079 --> 00:15:21.079
Illinois.

00:15:21.079 --> 00:15:22.260
So she goes, "Would you like that number?"

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:23.260
And I go, "Certainly."

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:24.260
She gave me that number.

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:28.420
I called the Schaumburg receptionist and I
tell her I'm looking for the project manager

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:35.860
of the Microtek Ultralight project and I'm
transferred around two, three, four, about

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:40.589
eight times, I'm talking to different people,
and then I end up talking to the vice president

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:44.720
of all of research and development for Motorola
cell phones, all their mobility.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.480
And I say, "Hey, I'm looking for the project
manager of the Microtek project.

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:50.959
This is Rick over in Arlington Heights", because
during the last eight calls I found out they

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.750
actually had an Arlington Heights facility.

00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.180
And he goes, sure.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.630
He gave me her phone number and says, "Well,
can I help you with anything?"

00:15:57.630 --> 00:16:00.339
I said, "No, no, no, no, I'll just talk to
Pam."

00:16:00.339 --> 00:16:03.680
Because Pam was the lady that was the project
manager.

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.230
So I called Pam and I don't get her, I get
her voice mail outgoing greeting saying she

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:12.430
just left on a two-week vacation, the date
she was returning and she said on her voice

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:16.339
mail, "If you need any help with anything
whatsoever, please call Alicia on extension

00:16:16.339 --> 00:16:17.860
blah, blah, blah."

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.410
Who's my next call to, right?

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:21.410
I call Alicia.

00:16:21.410 --> 00:16:25.270
I go, "Hey, Alicia, this is Rick over in Arlington
Heights, I'm looking."

00:16:25.270 --> 00:16:26.270
I go, "Wait a second.

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.930
Did Pam leave on vacation yet?

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.770
Because when I spoke to her you know last
week she said she might be going on vacation.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:34.660
Oh she has?

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:41.250
Well before she left she promised to send
me the source code to the Microtek Ultralight."

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:42.400
[laughter]

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.700
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And I was walking, now imagine
I'm already walking home, I live a 20 minute,

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.600
I live 20 minutes away by walking from the
law firm and it was snowing that day.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:58.660
So as I'm walking through traffic I'm trying
to press the cell phone really tight to my

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.130
ear so you can't hear all the traffic 'cause
I never expected this to work because it's

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.769
all extemporaneous.

00:17:03.769 --> 00:17:09.670
And, and then, and then Alicia goes, "Well,
Rick, what version do you want?"

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:10.670
[laughter]

00:17:10.670 --> 00:17:13.770
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And I didn't even know the
version numbers because then again this was

00:17:13.770 --> 00:17:17.299
all off the cuff and I just go, "How about
the latest and the greatest?"

00:17:17.299 --> 00:17:19.890
So she's fishing around on the computer, I
could hear her typing.

00:17:19.890 --> 00:17:26.150
I'm trying to walk out of traffic on to side
streets and she goes, "Rick, I found, I found

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:29.740
the latest source code release, it's dock
two, but there's a problem."

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.679
I go, "What's the problem?"

00:17:31.679 --> 00:17:35.950
She goes, "Well there's lots of directories
and there's you know tons of files in each

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:36.990
directory."

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:39.620
And I go, "Do you know how to use tar and
gzip?"

00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:41.210
[laughter and applause]

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:43.679
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And she goes, and she goes,
"No, I don't."

00:17:43.679 --> 00:17:44.850
I said, "Would you like to learn?"

00:17:44.850 --> 00:17:45.850
[laughter]

00:17:45.850 --> 00:17:47.500
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And she said, "Yes."

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.500
[laughter]

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.900
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I became her instructor
for the day and I taught her how to use tar

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.760
and gzip and at the end of the lesson there
was a three megabyte file, the source code

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:57.760
I wanted to look at.

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.470
So of course my next question was, "Do you
know what FTP is?"

00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:02.470
[laughter]

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.440
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And she goes, "File Transfer
Program."

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.990
And I go, "Yes, exactly."

00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:12.580
And then as I'm walking, I go, 'cause I didn't
prepare for this is I couldn't give her, oh,

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.400
my host name is hacker@ you know colorado.edu,
right?

00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400
[laughter]

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:21.830
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I actually had to remember,
I remembered an IP address to a server that

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.580
I had a bunch of accounts on and I gave her
the IP address.

00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:27.340
She tries connecting two, three, four, five
times, times out each time.

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.340
Then she goes, "Rick?"

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.340
I go, "Yeah?"

00:18:29.340 --> 00:18:34.160
She goes, "I need to talk to my security manager
about what you're asking me to do."

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:39.049
I go, "No, no, no" because she's already putting
me on hold, 'cause that's the last person,

00:18:39.049 --> 00:18:40.900
I didn't want her to talk to someone like
Eran.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.180
That'd be bad.

00:18:42.180 --> 00:18:43.180
[laughter]

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:47.770
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I'm walking, I'm walking
and the time is like the seconds feel like

00:18:47.770 --> 00:18:51.330
minutes and I'm really nervous, they're gonna
like record my call.

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:55.320
And so I was very careful when she you know
was gonna return to the line.

00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:59.240
I was gonna, I was going to be not saying
words, you know, I was just gonna be try to

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.350
feel it out.

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.360
So about five minutes later she comes back
on the line and she goes, "Rick?"

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360
"Uh huh?"

00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.630
"I, I talked to my security manager about
what you want me to do."

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:10.630
I go, "Uh huh."

00:19:10.630 --> 00:19:13.799
"That IP address you gave me is outside of
Motorola's campus."

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:14.960
"Uh huh."

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.590
You know, notice I'm not talking.

00:19:16.590 --> 00:19:24.410
She goes, "And we need to use a special proxy
server to send these files."

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:25.771
[laughter and applause]

00:19:25.771 --> 00:19:27.960
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: "And I don't have an account
on the proxy server.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:32.860
But my security manager was kind enough to
give me his personal user name and password."

00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.860
[laughter]

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.570
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: "to send you the file."

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.490
So within 15-20 minutes I have a source code
to the Microtek Ultralight.

00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:44.890
All I really did was look at it, 'cause I
was you know curious how it worked.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:48.690
What I really wanted to do at the time, since
the government was chasing me, I wanted to

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:49.950
create invisibility.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.700
So if I had the firmware I could actually
modify it because how AMPS worked that day

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.450
is you can control the registration and the
paging processes and I wanted to have better

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.780
control so I couldn't easily be tracked.

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.910
But you know like a company like you know
Motorola had you know all the best technology

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.901
money can buy and it, and it was an extemporaneous
attack that actually worked.

00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:08.620
I was really surprised, you know.

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.400
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So let's fast forward to
actually getting caught.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.710
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.010
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: [laughing]

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:15.320
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Ok.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.320
[laughter]

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:20.330
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: What was ultimately the
demise that got you caught?

00:20:20.330 --> 00:20:25.080
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well, actually there was
a guy, Tsutomu Shimomura, that became involved

00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:28.130
because his, his server was hacked.

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:33.120
And this guy, this guy is kind of an arrogant
security expert, if you Google him you'll

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.510
find out who he was and we wanted to like
to take him a couple notches down, it was

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:38.490
more of that type of thing.

00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.210
And then he went on a vigilante mission.

00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:46.299
And he, he and the FBI actually teamed up
to capture me.

00:20:46.299 --> 00:20:52.000
And they ended up, you know, in the long run
they ended up actually going out with the

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:57.350
radio direction finding gear and tracing the
cellular signal to determine my whereabouts,

00:20:57.350 --> 00:21:01.090
because I was in a fixed location in Raleigh,
North Carolina, because I just moved there

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:06.200
and I underestimated the amount of time that
the government would work, because ordinarily

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:08.390
they are quite slow.

00:21:08.390 --> 00:21:15.510
And, and they were able to trace the rad-,
the signal and then I get a--, and then I

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:20.440
was just--, they were able to trace a signal
and then the night this happened, I actually

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.419
was out.

00:21:22.419 --> 00:21:24.401
I was actually going to work out at the gym
that night.

00:21:24.401 --> 00:21:29.430
And I got, I arrived home late, around I don't
know about, I went, then I went to go eat

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:30.430
dinner.

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:34.250
I arrived home around 11:30 that night, something
like that, 11:30 or 12:00, and by that time

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.010
the FBI has this whole apartment building
under surveillance because they believed the

00:21:38.010 --> 00:21:40.600
signal was on the other side of the complex
in North Carolina.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.170
So I just parked my car, I have no idea that
it's all full of Feds.

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:48.350
I go up to my apartment and the story is in
the book, there's a lot more to this, but

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.470
I'm just trying to get to the, cut to the
chase.

00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:54.100
And then I just had a gut feeling that something
was wrong.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:59.049
I just had this sense, nagging gut feeling,
so I opened the door around one in the morning

00:21:59.049 --> 00:22:03.679
and I peered out into the parking lot and
I just go, "I must be being paranoid."

00:22:03.679 --> 00:22:05.110
And I shut the door.

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:08.650
That, me opening the door and looking out
was how they actually found me.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.830
'Cause they couldn't track the signal because
the signals were bouncing.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:17.370
And then I get a knock on the door and it's
1:30, and to me, I keep hacker's hours, I

00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:20.030
stay up late and I sleep late.

00:22:20.030 --> 00:22:22.430
And I guess just my reaction was, "Who is
it?"

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:25.600
And it was "FBI, open up."

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.500
And I go, "Who are you looking for?"

00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:30.600
They go, "Are you Kevin Mitnick?"

00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.850
I go, "No, go check the mailboxes downstairs,
because you have the wrong apartment.

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.130
And they left for about ten minutes.

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.200
[laughter]

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:44.740
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And at that time, in that
ten minutes I'm looking for, I'm on the second

00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:49.310
story, I'm looking for a rope to go down the
other side of my patio to get the hell out

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:50.460
of there.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:53.190
And I, and I, there was nothing, you know,
I didn't prepare, so I didn't have a rope

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:56.750
and I wasn't gonna tie bed sheets together
because I didn't want to you know get shot

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:57.940
on the way down.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:04.830
So they, they knocked again and I was already
on the phone with my family and with an attorney.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.110
And they're knocking and I go, you know, they
go, "Are you Kevin Mitnick?"

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:10.360
"I already told you I'm not.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.490
It's 1:30 in the morning, you have the wrong
apartment."

00:23:13.490 --> 00:23:17.059
You know, and then I finally, he goes, "Well
open up, we wanna talk to you."

00:23:17.059 --> 00:23:23.210
I crack the door, all these agents pour in,
they start searching and they ask me for a

00:23:23.210 --> 00:23:28.480
driver's license, I go, "Here I am" because
I had, had, I was under a new name.

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.789
And, and they started searching and I'm asking
where their search warrant is and they're

00:23:31.789 --> 00:23:36.770
just ignoring me and eventually it gets to
the point, you know this is going on for a

00:23:36.770 --> 00:23:39.950
long time, they're searching my apartment,
they really didn't find much.

00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:42.700
And they finally were asking again, "Are you
Kevin Mitnick?"

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.990
And I said, "No, I just showed you my driver's
license, I'm not this guy Mitnick."

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:51.480
And then they handed me a wanted poster of
myself and said, "Doesn't that look like you?"

00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.480
[laughter]

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:55.440
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I take the wanted poster
and I'm looking at it.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.060
I study it, and I'm thinking to myself, "Could
I really get out of this?"

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.060
Right?

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:04.380
And I'm looking at it and I finally, I finally
go, "No, that doesn't look anything like me"

00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.470
and I hand it back.

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:07.000
[laughter and applause]

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.090
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So eventually this, this
thing is going on for awhile.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:17.240
One of these agents opens a briefcase on my
desk, you know, unlocks a briefcase, and he's

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.410
about to go through it and I had some very
important papers in there, like blank birth

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:23.160
certificates I didn't want him to find.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:24.809
I figured that'd be suspicious.

00:24:24.809 --> 00:24:25.809
[laughter]

00:24:25.809 --> 00:24:29.030
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I, I, I went over to the
table because I wasn't under arrest.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.030
And I said, "Hey!"

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:31.030
And he looks up.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:35.190
I slammed the briefcase down and I lock it
and he goes, and his face turned red of course

00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:39.550
and he took the briefcase to the kitchen because
he was gonna use a carving knife to actually

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:40.590
open it up.

00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:44.810
And then the other agent stopped him because
it'd be illegal search, right, to open up

00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:45.810
a container.

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:52.040
So then finally the FBI went to go get a search
warrant and, and then during that process

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.280
they found a wallet and then they found a
paystub in the name of Kevin Mitnick because

00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:02.110
I had a ski jacket that I had a paystub from
like 1980 something that I inadvertently left

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.110
in there.

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:04.240
And then they finally arrested me.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:09.049
So it was like this whole three and a half
hour ordeal and I was trying to get out of,

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:13.030
and at one point before they found it they
said, "Well, you know what, we're not sure

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:18.370
if you're Mitnick or not, so we're gonna take
you down to the FBI and fingerprint you and

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:21.280
then we're gonna compare the fingerprint records
to rule out that you're, you know to rule

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:22.530
out that you're Mitnick.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:25.270
I said, "Why didn't you think of that before?

00:25:25.270 --> 00:25:27.270
We could've saved all this time.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:29.919
In fact, tell me what time you want me to
show up at your office tomorrow and you can

00:25:29.919 --> 00:25:31.040
fingerprint me."

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:32.040
[laughter]

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:34.940
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I tried my best.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.480
It didn't work.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:44.370
But the craziest thing is I think is the time
that when I was in court and they had told

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:51.309
the judge that not only do they have to detain
me, but because I'm a national security threat

00:25:51.309 --> 00:25:55.430
that they actually have to keep me away from
the phone.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:59.010
And the reason they had to keep me away from
the phone is I could pick up the phone and

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:03.070
I could whistle the launch codes to start
a nuclear war.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:04.070
So.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.070
[laughter]

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.070
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I'm serious.

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:08.790
So I actually laughed in court, right?

00:26:08.790 --> 00:26:14.200
Because, because I figured the prosecutor's
gonna lose all credibility with the judge.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.700
Unfortunately the judge bought it and I ended
up, you know, in solitary confinement for

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:20.700
eight and a half years.

00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:24.690
So during this time in solitary confinement
I perfected how I could whistle the launch

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.429
codes and I want to share that with all of
you today.

00:26:26.429 --> 00:26:27.429
[laughter]

00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:28.429
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Ok?

00:26:28.429 --> 00:26:31.820
I, I, I, you know now I need a phone because
if I'm gonna connect to NORAD I need some

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:33.669
connectivity, so I'm gonna connect to the
phone here.

00:26:33.669 --> 00:26:39.280
So give me a second, and what we're gonna
do here now, you might have to take cover,

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.140
[Mission Impossible whistling sound]

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.140
[laughter]

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:44.140
[sirens]

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:45.140
[laughter]

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:46.140
[sirens continue]

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:50.720
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I'm sorry, New York's gone.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:27:03.900
But I mean the timing was wrong in that, but
I thought that would be funny, but.

00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.900
[laughter]

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.260
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah, so, back then when
I was involved in hacking I mean it was all

00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:10.560
mysterious.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:14.010
The internet wasn't really so popular it is
today.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:18.100
You know, they looked at you like as a dark,
like as a witch, like a dark you know magician

00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:23.580
or warlock and they had such fear that they
would actually that people actually believed

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:24.720
you could whistle the launch codes.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.720
So.

00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:27.962
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: That wasn't the only myth
that was made about you, right?

00:27:27.962 --> 00:27:29.049
I mean you have several.

00:27:29.049 --> 00:27:30.870
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, yeah.

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:35.150
I mean there's just so many, I mean.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:39.630
[chuckles] Oh yeah, that I you know hacked
into NORAD and nearly started world war III,

00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.279
that actually was stated as fact in the New
York Times, and that was actually from a movie

00:27:43.279 --> 00:27:44.900
called War Games in 1983.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.900
[laughter]

00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:47.840
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:53.799
But I was under this severe, you know I was,
I was in high security in federal prison during

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:58.309
this you know, when I was detained and I was
in what they call "the hole."

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:03.570
And this was a solitary confinement, so if
you are like the Mexican mafia, if you're,

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:08.490
you know, Al Capone, if you're kill a prison
guard, they put you in this place that you're

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:11.160
just under 23/24 hour lockdown.

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:15.559
And I had a special phone restriction that
I was only allowed to call like five people,

00:28:15.559 --> 00:28:18.700
my mom, my grandmother, my aunt, my attorney.

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:22.070
And so I figured, you know, I'm kind of at
the bottom of the bucket here in solitary

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:25.600
confinement in a federal detention center,
but you know that didn't stop me from phone

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600
hacking.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600
[laughter]

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.600
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Not at all.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So you were hacking from
prison?

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Hacking from prison.

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600
Let me tell you how, is

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600
[laughter]

00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.190
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Is whenever I had to make
a phone call, they would actually shackle

00:28:36.190 --> 00:28:40.169
my arms, shackle my legs, they'd walk me like
30 feet to this room that had a bank of pay

00:28:40.169 --> 00:28:46.520
phones and the guard would look at you know
the numbers I can call.

00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:48.220
He'd say, "Which number do you want, Mitnick?"

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.169
And he would dial zero plus the number to
get, 'cause it was a collect call obviously.

00:28:52.169 --> 00:28:54.690
And he'd place his chair four feet away from
the payphones.

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:59.520
So he'd just sit there and his eyes would
never move from what I'm doing.

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.810
And I'd, and the handset cord on the payphone
was a little bit longer than it is like on

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:05.780
the street, I guess they're longer in federal
prison, who knows.

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:11.270
So I'd walk back and forth when I was talking
and I would constantly be scratching my back,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:15.030
you know, switching phone, just getting him
used to this behavior, scratching my back,

00:29:15.030 --> 00:29:18.280
and actually rub my back against the payphone.

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:24.010
And then I figured when I ended the call,
I acted like I was still talking to the person

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:28.410
that he dialed and I just, you know, keep
talking and I'd be rubbing my back and then

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.919
behind my back I would just hang up, you know,
hang you know push down the switch hook.

00:29:32.919 --> 00:29:36.909
And then I'd move my hand to the front because
I knew that I had 18 seconds before the phone

00:29:36.909 --> 00:29:41.029
went into reorder, meaning beep, beep, beep,
beep, so I had 18 seconds to do this.

00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:45.360
So I'd just continue to scratch and then I'd
put my hand behind again and dial zero plus

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.990
the number I wanted, 'cause I was able to
dial the touch tone behind my back, touch

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.490
tone pad, I was able to dial the phone number
behind my back.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.100
And then I'd have to continue in the conversation
because I knew within a, you know, 30 seconds

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.860
the operator was gonna come on the phone,
you know come on the line and ask who the

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.890
collect call was from, so I'd have to say,
"Well, you know, tell Uncle Harry that Kevin

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:03.890
says hi."

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:07.940
And when I said Kevin that's when the operator
was asking who the collect call was from.

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:11.940
So this is how I was able to call anyone I
wanted, you know, even though the guard, even

00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:15.240
though I was in plain site of this you know
this officer.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:16.240
[laughter]

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.549
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And this was working for
like three weeks.

00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:19.549
[laughter]

00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:25.290
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And then early one morning
my door opens and it was like the executives

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.789
of the prison, they put me in handcuffs, they
take me to this like attorney-client visiting

00:30:29.789 --> 00:30:33.960
room and they sit me down and the captain
of the prison goes, "Mitnick!

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.220
How you doing it?

00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.440
How're you redialing the phone?"

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.440
[laughter]

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:38.770
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I go, "What are you talking
about?"

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.770
[laughter]

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.720
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: "Our officer is watching
every move you make and somehow you're redialing

00:30:43.720 --> 00:30:44.720
the phone.''

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.720
[laughter]

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:47.680
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I said, "Hey, guys, I'm not
David Copperfield."

00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:48.680
[laughter]

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.490
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: 'Cause I wasn't gonna admit
to anything.

00:30:50.490 --> 00:30:53.429
Then they say, "Well, we're monitoring everything
you do downstairs."

00:30:53.429 --> 00:30:54.630
Which I knew they were.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:57.380
And I just said, "Maybe there's a failure
in your monitoring system."

00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:02.361
You know, 'cause I still, you know, I'm not
gonna admit anything because then they could

00:31:02.361 --> 00:31:04.100
use it against you.

00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:11.020
So, so a couple days later I hear some commotion
outside the door and I peek out and it's Pacific

00:31:11.020 --> 00:31:17.080
Bell and they're installing a phone jack across
the corridor from where my, where my room

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.399
was.

00:31:18.399 --> 00:31:23.870
And I'm thinking, are these guys actually
gonna install a phone in my room and then

00:31:23.870 --> 00:31:25.220
try to restrict who I can call?

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:27.669
That's gonna be fun, you know.

00:31:27.669 --> 00:31:29.020
And I found out what happened afterwards.

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:32.820
They actually, the next time I had to make
a call, the guard brings a phone, he plugs

00:31:32.820 --> 00:31:36.480
it in, he dials the number I want, then he
puts the hand cord through this like trap

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.950
door in the door.

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:41.490
So I only have the handset, I can't touch
the touch tone pad, it's beyond the locked

00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:42.490
door.

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:46.030
And then I'm having a flashback to Hannibal
Lecter in Silence of the Lambs.

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:47.030
[laughter]

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.740
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So that was crazy.

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.520
They were so embarrassed by this they never
told the court, so the court never found out

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:57.580
that I was calling anybody that I wanted to,
'cause they would look like fools, so.

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:58.580
[laughter]

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:03.549
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Let's talk a little bit
about, you know, finally getting out, the

00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:04.549
Free Kevin Movement.

00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:07.990
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, yeah, well, I mean a
lot of stuff was happening in my case, like

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:12.610
I was detained for four and a half years without
trial and I, you know, and a lot of civil

00:32:12.610 --> 00:32:18.070
liberties issues so then 2600 Magazine actually
started this Free Kevin Movement to kind of

00:32:18.070 --> 00:32:23.320
you know like why is this guy denied the ability
to help his lawyer look at the evidence?

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:27.169
Why has he been held for so many years, you
know, in custody without a trial?

00:32:27.169 --> 00:32:31.660
So they started this whole Free Kevin Movement
and it was, and, and I, I couldn't believe

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:35.670
this one day I was in my room in, in detention
and I looked out this like, they have this

00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:39.279
slitted window, and I look out and I heard
they were having Free Kevin protests that

00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:45.210
day and I look and I see an airplane flying,
like a puddle jumper, and it was pulling a

00:32:45.210 --> 00:32:49.220
Free Kevin banner on an airplane and I could
see this from my prison cell.

00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:53.270
So it was like kind of like, wow!, you know,
like I never expected this.

00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:57.840
And anyway, they were trying to get the word
out to, it wasn't like the Free Kevin Movement

00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.880
was saying hey, this guy shouldn't be punished
for his hacking, but it was more like you

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:06.480
know why is he held for, detained for so long,
you know why, why is the judge not allowing

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:07.840
his lawyers to look at the evidence?

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.299
So it was kind of to get the word out.

00:33:11.299 --> 00:33:13.340
And they did a good job of it, you know.

00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:15.559
And ultimately did it help my case?

00:33:15.559 --> 00:33:16.559
No.

00:33:16.559 --> 00:33:20.540
'Cause the government doesn't care, really
about, you know, protests, but eventually

00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:27.830
I made a deal with the government after, well
the reason I made the deal is I found this

00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:29.669
case.

00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:34.170
Since I was hacking for more curiosity, I
wanted to look at source code to become a

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.170
better hacker.

00:33:35.170 --> 00:33:38.410
It wasn't about selling the source code, it
wasn't about, you know, doing anything with

00:33:38.410 --> 00:33:41.059
it but using it to leverage it to hack in.

00:33:41.059 --> 00:33:47.820
And I found this case called Rich, this case,
this IRS agent called Richard, his name is

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:50.830
Richard Sabinsky and he was doing the same
thing.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:56.010
He was working for the IRS but actually looking
up people's tax returns because he was curious.

00:33:56.010 --> 00:33:59.820
You know he wanted to know how much money
they made and all this sort of thing.

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:04.350
And he was prosecuted for the same charge,
you know crimes that I was.

00:34:04.350 --> 00:34:08.530
And he actually appealed his case, and this
was a federal case, saying well he did it

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:09.530
out of curiosity.

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.690
He didn't sell the information, he didn't
disclose it to anybody, it was a case of curiosity.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:18.569
And the, and the federal appellate court said,
well if it's, if you didn't use or disclose

00:34:18.569 --> 00:34:20.499
the information, it's not a federal crime.

00:34:20.499 --> 00:34:24.139
So I actually wanted to go to trial, say hey,
I did all this hacking, you're right, you

00:34:24.139 --> 00:34:29.369
know I admit everything, but I did it for
this purpose, you know, it was more my curiosity

00:34:29.369 --> 00:34:34.099
and learning, it wasn't about using or disclosing
it for monetary gain.

00:34:34.099 --> 00:34:39.789
And my lawyer told me that the federal prosecutor
at the time said, told him, warned him, that

00:34:39.789 --> 00:34:43.951
if your client doesn't take a deal, we're
just gonna, we're gonna try him here, let's

00:34:43.951 --> 00:34:48.339
say we, we lose, we're just gonna move him
to this jurisdiction and try him there.

00:34:48.339 --> 00:34:52.919
We don't care if we win or lose, because we'll
keep your client in custody so long that it

00:34:52.919 --> 00:34:53.919
won't matter anyway.

00:34:53.919 --> 00:34:55.009
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: 'Cause you hacked in many
jurisdictions?

00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:57.910
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Right, well, when you're
doing, you know when you're hacking over dial

00:34:57.910 --> 00:35:00.650
up, I mean this was dial up in these days
over the internet, you're going through so

00:35:00.650 --> 00:35:05.930
many jurisdictions, they could just put you
on the bus for this ever ending, you know,

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:10.009
series of trials, so I just figured, hey,
you know I, I wanted to settle it on the best

00:35:10.009 --> 00:35:15.579
terms possible and one big negotiating point
is they didn't want me to tell my story for

00:35:15.579 --> 00:35:16.579
life.

00:35:16.579 --> 00:35:20.150
In fact another hacker named Kevin Poulsen
recently wrote a great book called Kingpin,

00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:27.789
he's a editorial, I think he's the editorial
director of Wired.com and his deal is he can't

00:35:27.789 --> 00:35:29.950
write his story for life, right?

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.430
And so, we, my attorney negotiated and it
was a seven years.

00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:37.730
For seven years I was pretty much blacked
out from being able to tell my story and that

00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:43.750
expired in 2007, then I teamed up with this
awesome co-author, his name is Bill Simon,

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.539
and he's actually here today in this audience
with his girlfriend.

00:35:46.539 --> 00:35:47.539
He's right over here.

00:35:47.539 --> 00:35:53.390
Bill, why don't you come up here and say hi
to everybody?

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:54.390
[applause]

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:56.829
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Ok.

00:35:56.829 --> 00:35:58.710
He doesn't want to do, he doesn't want to,
he doesn't want to come up to stage, but this

00:35:58.710 --> 00:36:01.440
book would have not been possible without
Bill.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.359
I mean Bill put up with my hacker's hours
for two years.

00:36:06.359 --> 00:36:10.770
I mean Bill's the type of guy that rises at
6:00, has breakfast at 7:00 and he's hard

00:36:10.770 --> 00:36:11.789
at work at 8:00.

00:36:11.789 --> 00:36:13.410
I'm going to bed at 8:00.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:22.119
[laughing] So, so, but we finally got it done
and I, I thank Bill because without him the

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:26.369
book Ghost in the Wires would not be here
for all of you to read, and so thank you Bill.

00:36:26.369 --> 00:36:30.130
I appreciate your hard work.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:31.130
[applause]

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:37.049
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Not only not being able
to tell your story for seven years, you also

00:36:37.049 --> 00:36:39.049
had some other restrictions as part of your
release.

00:36:39.049 --> 00:36:42.170
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh yeah, I couldn't, I couldn't
touch a transistor.

00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:44.890
Anything with a transistor in it was restricted.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:50.059
I, the federal government was so, I don't
know if they were scared or if they were trying

00:36:50.059 --> 00:36:54.219
to punish me or what the reason was, but anything
with electronics I wasn't allowed to touch

00:36:54.219 --> 00:36:55.219
without their permission.

00:36:55.219 --> 00:36:56.849
So even to use a fax machine.

00:36:56.849 --> 00:37:01.869
And then after two years, it was really interesting
because I was commissioned to write Art of

00:37:01.869 --> 00:37:06.380
Deception, again with Bill, which was my first
book on social engineering.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:09.900
And what had happened is I called the probation
department, saying, hey, I was researching

00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:15.479
word processors that have no way to connect
to a modem, no way to connect to the internet,

00:37:15.479 --> 00:37:20.769
just like stand alone and I spent like a couple
weeks researching the stuff and then I presented

00:37:20.769 --> 00:37:24.999
the case to the probation department, hey,
I could use this word processor so I could,

00:37:24.999 --> 00:37:29.099
you know, work on this book with my co-author,
and my, and the probation officer said, "Hey,

00:37:29.099 --> 00:37:31.730
you know Kevin, we're gonna let you get a
laptop."

00:37:31.730 --> 00:37:32.730
"What?"

00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:37.029
Yeah, they're gonna let me get a lap, they,
they allowed me to get a laptop under two

00:37:37.029 --> 00:37:38.029
conditions.

00:37:38.029 --> 00:37:39.759
One, is I don't tell the media.

00:37:39.759 --> 00:37:41.460
That was the biggest condition.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.569
Two, is I don't connect to the internet.

00:37:43.569 --> 00:37:46.369
So then I was able finally to write you know
Art of Deception with Bill.

00:37:46.369 --> 00:37:54.430
I mean there are just so many stories to tell
I don't know where you, I mean there just,

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:56.390
it's just crazy, so.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:58.400
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: One last one and then

00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.400
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Ok.

00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:00.630
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: we'll open up to questions.

00:38:00.630 --> 00:38:04.470
Through the book it it's pretty obvious that
you have an addiction to hacking.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:07.849
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I would call it an extreme
passion.

00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:08.849
[laughter]

00:38:08.849 --> 00:38:12.359
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: [laughing] I mean, that's
what drove me.

00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:17.690
I mean I remember when I was in my younger
years when I, this is how I guess passionate

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:21.019
I was is when I was young my parents couldn't
afford a computer.

00:38:21.019 --> 00:38:27.489
Oh and let me remind you how I started off
on this path is when I went to my first programming

00:38:27.489 --> 00:38:32.799
assignment in high school was to write a Fortran
program to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers.

00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:35.319
And I thought that was a boring assignment.

00:38:35.319 --> 00:38:38.459
So I thought it would be cooler to write a
program to steal everyone's password.

00:38:38.459 --> 00:38:39.459
[laughter]

00:38:39.459 --> 00:38:41.969
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Just for the fun of it.

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:47.170
And what we had at school was an Olivetti
110 baud terminals, acoustic coupler modems

00:38:47.170 --> 00:38:53.690
and we had a PDP 11, I think it was like an
11/34 running RISC to CED , in downtown Los

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:54.690
Angeles.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:58.020
So all the students used VT100 terminals to
connect to the school's computer.

00:38:58.020 --> 00:39:02.869
So I wrote a program that would be a log-in
simulator, kind of like a fishing tool, so

00:39:02.869 --> 00:39:05.960
people would think they were logged out, they
would type in "Hello", we'd ask them to put

00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.849
in their user name and password, it would
log them in.

00:39:07.849 --> 00:39:09.450
This was my first program.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.950
The first one that I ever wrote.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:14.099
It wasn't Hello World, it was I'm Gonna Steal
Your Password.

00:39:14.099 --> 00:39:15.750
[laughter and applause]

00:39:15.750 --> 00:39:20.719
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I worked really hard on
it because I had to like do sys calls, interact

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:24.730
with the operating system, it wasn't as easy
as finding the first 100 Fibonacci numbers

00:39:24.730 --> 00:39:30.690
and, and because I spent so much time on this
assignment, I wasn't able to finish or even

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:34.069
do, start the Fibonacci assignment, so it
was due.

00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:35.829
So when the teacher goes, "Kevin, where's
you assignment?

00:39:35.829 --> 00:39:37.079
I let you into class.

00:39:37.079 --> 00:39:40.609
I waived your prerequisite, and you're not,
you're not even, you know, holding your weight

00:39:40.609 --> 00:39:41.609
here."

00:39:41.609 --> 00:39:45.209
I said, "Well, I was busy working on this
other program, let me show you how it works."

00:39:45.209 --> 00:39:46.209
[laughter]

00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:48.140
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: So I showed him the program
of stealing passwords.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.589
And he goes, "That's awesome."

00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:50.589
[laughter]

00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:53.349
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: And he gave, and he gave
me an A.

00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:54.349
[laughter]

00:39:54.349 --> 00:39:56.910
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: [laughing] That's awesome.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.499
He actually showed it to everyone else in
class.

00:39:59.499 --> 00:40:00.650
"Look what Kevin did."

00:40:00.650 --> 00:40:03.920
And like all these atta boys so the ethics
taught when I was in high school

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920
[laughter]

00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:07.499
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: that hacking is cool.

00:40:07.499 --> 00:40:08.569
And it wasn't even illegal.

00:40:08.569 --> 00:40:12.279
It was 1979, they didn't have the first computer
crime law until 1984.

00:40:12.279 --> 00:40:17.329
So I started in an era where it was encouraged
to do this stuff because it was like no harm,

00:40:17.329 --> 00:40:18.329
no foul, you know.

00:40:18.329 --> 00:40:21.369
I wasn't stealing passwords 'cause I wanted
to get in their accounts, it was more like

00:40:21.369 --> 00:40:22.369
just for doing it.

00:40:22.369 --> 00:40:24.170
So it was kind of like a cool thing.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:25.729
The teacher liked it, you know, so.

00:40:25.729 --> 00:40:26.729
[laughter]

00:40:26.729 --> 00:40:29.719
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: So do you still have this
deep passion today?

00:40:29.719 --> 00:40:31.749
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I hack every day.

00:40:31.749 --> 00:40:34.349
But I do, there's only one difference.

00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:36.329
I have authorization.

00:40:36.329 --> 00:40:40.779
So companies that hire me to break into their
systems give me a jail, get out of jail free

00:40:40.779 --> 00:40:44.490
card and as long as I have that card in my
pocket I feel really comfortable and I still

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:47.839
get to do the same thing I was doing 20 years
ago today.

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:50.410
And all, and the techniques still work, like
social engineering.

00:40:50.410 --> 00:40:54.609
I mean the technical exploits change, you
know as we build more complex systems it creates

00:40:54.609 --> 00:40:59.849
more vulnerabilities as you know, so we, you
have the technical side, which you know now

00:40:59.849 --> 00:41:05.749
you could download Metasploit you have commercial
products like Canvas and Core.

00:41:05.749 --> 00:41:08.980
Metasploit is awesome if you're into, I don't
know how many of you know Metasploit here

00:41:08.980 --> 00:41:13.170
in the audience, but these tools weren't available
when I was hacking.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.900
It was like you had to do it on your own.

00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:19.079
There was, there was, you know there was no
you know frameworks, not where you can go

00:41:19.079 --> 00:41:21.170
and Google, you know Google didn't exist by
the way.

00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:26.289
I couldn't, I couldn't Google you know exploits,
you know it was all on your own and today,

00:41:26.289 --> 00:41:32.160
I mean, what kids can do, which I didn't have
this option, was you know, they could, you

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.900
know, have, you know, open source Linux boxes,
you know, for, you know, next to nothing.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:43.400
They could get access to frameworks like Metasploit,
so they could experiment and have fun hacking

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.299
you know legitimately, and I didn't have this
option when I was a kid, it just didn't exist.

00:41:47.299 --> 00:41:52.289
So what I chose to do was go to universities,
all the Cal state universities in Los Angeles

00:41:52.289 --> 00:41:57.630
and I would, until I wore out my welcome,
right, and all the Radio Shacks in Los Angeles,

00:41:57.630 --> 00:41:58.630
yeah.

00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:59.630
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Great.

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:03.410
Let's, we have a couple of microphones if
you could just raise your hand a microphone

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.910
will come to you.

00:42:05.910 --> 00:42:07.710
[pause]

00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:12.749
&gt;&gt;male #1: I had [inaudible]

00:42:12.749 --> 00:42:13.749
[laughter]

00:42:13.749 --> 00:42:15.680
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Somebody hacked your mic.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.859
&gt;&gt;male #1: I don't need a mic, I'm loud enough.

00:42:17.859 --> 00:42:18.949
I had a free [inaudible]

00:42:18.949 --> 00:42:19.949
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: [laughing]

00:42:19.949 --> 00:42:24.390
&gt;&gt;male #1: So did you ever use the name Nussbaum?

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:28.170
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: No.

00:42:28.170 --> 00:42:31.160
That was a myth.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.369
&gt;&gt;male #1: Because a friend of mine got arrested
at [inaudible]

00:42:33.369 --> 00:42:34.800
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah, I heard about that.

00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:39.739
They thought he was me and they arrested him
when I was a fugitive, unfortunately, and

00:42:39.739 --> 00:42:43.109
then I guess they thought I was using his
name, I never used it.

00:42:43.109 --> 00:42:48.890
The names I used was Erik Weisz, Brian Merrill,
they're all in my book, the names I used.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.930
It was a handful, but never his name, never
even talked, I never even knew the guy.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:55.420
So that again was another myth.

00:42:55.420 --> 00:42:56.589
&gt;&gt;male #1: [inaudible]

00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:57.589
[laughter]

00:42:57.589 --> 00:43:00.499
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Tell him, tell him it wasn't
me.

00:43:00.499 --> 00:43:02.260
&gt;&gt;male #1: That's why I asked.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:04.469
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Yeah, they also arrested
another guy who they thought was the informant

00:43:04.469 --> 00:43:10.900
on my case, a guy named Eric Hienz, his real
name is Justin Petersen and, and they actually

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.540
were almost gonna arrest I think Robert Steele,
who was an ex-CIA agent who does a lot of

00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:17.180
talks at conferences.

00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:22.730
The agents actually asked him to pick up his
pants on one leg because the real Justin had

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:24.960
a you know had a prosthetic leg.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.589
And they were almost gonna arrest him.

00:43:26.589 --> 00:43:28.019
'Cause they're just going crazy.

00:43:28.019 --> 00:43:31.440
They wanted to arrest somebody, but they kept
getting the wrong people.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.119
[pause] Any other questions?

00:43:35.119 --> 00:43:36.119
Yes?

00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:37.119
[pause]

00:43:37.119 --> 00:43:43.400
&gt;&gt;male #2: With the, is it on?

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.160
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: No.

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:48.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: Alright.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:49.920
[pause]

00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:54.440
&gt;&gt;male #1: Just speak loud.

00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:56.279
&gt;&gt;unknown: Right.

00:43:56.279 --> 00:44:02.349
&gt;&gt;male #2: With everybody getting so connected,
I mean that's kind of what we do here, making

00:44:02.349 --> 00:44:08.559
sure that everybody's connected, that everything's
accessible to everybody as much as possible,

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:11.759
is security intractable for regular people?

00:44:11.759 --> 00:44:16.059
I mean I know that social engineering always
worked and probably always will work, but

00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:18.920
you can get so much further with it now because
you can you know send out

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:19.920
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Spear fishing.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:20.920
&gt;&gt;male #2: Yeah.

00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.349
You can try and scam ten million people at
a clip.

00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:27.480
Is this an intractable problem that we're
just gonna be in this situation forever?

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.279
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: No, I don't really know.

00:44:29.279 --> 00:44:34.380
I mean the, I look at the solutions to social
engineering as using technology whenever possible

00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:40.969
to take the decision making out of the you
know human actor's, you know, hand so to speak.

00:44:40.969 --> 00:44:43.729
And then training and ed-, you know a lot
of training and education.

00:44:43.729 --> 00:44:48.430
A lot of the, you know don't forget the, the
social engineering usually re, also relies

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:52.869
on some technical vulnerability like an older
version of Adobe Acrobat, you know, that the

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:58.750
person's using, so I mean by keeping the technology
up to date I think you mitigate the social

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:02.559
engineering because if you look most of the
attack vectors today are client side.

00:45:02.559 --> 00:45:07.319
So you're looking to exploit the browser,
you're looking to exploit Adobe Acrobat, Flash,

00:45:07.319 --> 00:45:13.450
Java, the Media Players, the Instant Messaging
tools, so I find that a lot of my clients,

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:16.630
they're not keeping that stuff up to date
and that's how I'm able to exploit them.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:21.719
You know I just had a client, a multimillion
dollar client, and they were running like

00:45:21.719 --> 00:45:24.609
version I think 9.1 of Adobe.

00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:28.979
And how I found, what I did was I used social
networking to find, to create my target list

00:45:28.979 --> 00:45:33.430
on LinkedIn and so, you know it's easy, you
could even use Google of course, but you know

00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:38.430
you find, you try to look for network administrators
and engineers and people that are likely have

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:41.890
domain admin rights and you target those people
first, right?

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:48.170
So I was able, so I found out who this administrator
works with at one of the companies that supports

00:45:48.170 --> 00:45:53.400
one of their IT functions and e-mailed him
a PDF that had an exploit in it.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.480
He opened it up and I was able to get into
his box.

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:58.029
He had domain admin rights and the game was
over.

00:45:58.029 --> 00:45:59.789
I mean it was just that easy.

00:45:59.789 --> 00:46:04.029
If he had a, had an updated version of Adobe
at the time, because the problem was patched,

00:46:04.029 --> 00:46:07.229
you know, maybe the social engineering side
would have worked, but it wouldn't have gotten

00:46:07.229 --> 00:46:08.229
me anywhere, right?

00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:11.219
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Switch your clients to
Chrome OS or Chrome?

00:46:11.219 --> 00:46:12.219
[laughter]

00:46:12.219 --> 00:46:13.410
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: I use Chrome.

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:17.449
I shouldn't tell you this because now maybe
I could be a target.

00:46:17.449 --> 00:46:18.449
[laughing]

00:46:18.449 --> 00:46:19.449
[laughter]

00:46:19.449 --> 00:46:21.180
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: One last question.

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.509
Let's give somebody a, oh, go ahead.

00:46:23.509 --> 00:46:28.109
&gt;&gt;male #3: So you mentioned writing a Hello
World program.

00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:29.109
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Right.

00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:34.131
&gt;&gt;male #3: And you mentioned how your teacher
kind of encouraged you to, you know it was

00:46:34.131 --> 00:46:36.089
encouraged to, to hack and it was cool.

00:46:36.089 --> 00:46:38.540
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well, it was after I wrote
the first program because I didn't tell the

00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.449
teacher what I was doing the first, during
the first, during that development.

00:46:41.449 --> 00:46:48.339
&gt;&gt;male #3: So I'm curious if you feel that
education for developers has changed in any

00:46:48.339 --> 00:46:49.339
regard.

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:54.930
'Cause I still find that when we're trying
to get people into computers and development,

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:56.839
we still kind of go, "Look how easy this is!

00:46:56.839 --> 00:46:57.839
Print Hello World.

00:46:57.839 --> 00:46:58.920
Great, you wrote your first program.

00:46:58.920 --> 00:46:59.920
It's real easy."

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:00.920
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well

00:47:00.920 --> 00:47:04.779
&gt;&gt;male #3: We don't build on a stronger foundation
of oh, well, here's the building blocks and

00:47:04.779 --> 00:47:05.779
security.

00:47:05.779 --> 00:47:09.940
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well absolutely, I mean most,
most of the, most of the time we're methodology,

00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:15.190
well, most of the time when we're able to
get into a client's infrastructure is easy

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:19.099
by exploiting a web app, usually with something
like SQL injection.

00:47:19.099 --> 00:47:23.700
I mean it's, I mean, and so if the developers
of those applications, you know, you know

00:47:23.700 --> 00:47:30.170
sanitize their input, we wouldn't be able
to get in you know at that point, so I find

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:32.549
that there's a lot of low-hanging fruit out
there.

00:47:32.549 --> 00:47:38.519
There's lots of web applications, interfacing
web applications that are insecure and easy

00:47:38.519 --> 00:47:39.519
to exploit.

00:47:39.519 --> 00:47:41.680
I mean case in point is you have like LulzSec
right?

00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.339
They're out exploiting everybody in the world,
you know, they're doing some stupid attacks

00:47:45.339 --> 00:47:50.239
with DDoS attacks, but a lot of, all the other
victims are you know simple sequel injection.

00:47:50.239 --> 00:47:55.319
Look at Sony, they were hacked 12 times, and
I think like 10 of those hacks were SQL injection

00:47:55.319 --> 00:48:01.459
hacks, alright so the developers are obviously,
they either bought the code from somebody

00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:04.829
else, bought the application from a third
party who obviously didn't have secured coding

00:48:04.829 --> 00:48:11.380
practices you know in their development cycle,
and, or they did it in house and it was a

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:12.989
shoddy security and got, got hacked.

00:48:12.989 --> 00:48:18.369
&gt;&gt;male #3: So I guess the question is then,
why hasn't education changed for developers

00:48:18.369 --> 00:48:19.369
or --

00:48:19.369 --> 00:48:22.059
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Well they have it available,
it's just the question of companies actually

00:48:22.059 --> 00:48:23.219
using it in the development cycle.

00:48:23.219 --> 00:48:24.709
&gt;&gt;male #3: Well companies and schools, right?

00:48:24.709 --> 00:48:25.709
Why are --

00:48:25.709 --> 00:48:26.709
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, schools.

00:48:26.709 --> 00:48:27.709
&gt;&gt;male #4: Liability laws, Eric.

00:48:27.709 --> 00:48:28.709
The liabilities are in the wrong place.

00:48:28.709 --> 00:48:34.989
I mean credit cards used to be if you.

00:48:34.989 --> 00:48:39.979
The thing that enabled, the problem is that
the liability laws are in the wrong place.

00:48:39.979 --> 00:48:44.250
When credit cards first came out, there was
a question of who gets, who has to pay for

00:48:44.250 --> 00:48:45.250
the fraud.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:46.250
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Right.

00:48:46.250 --> 00:48:48.979
&gt;&gt;male #4: And the answer was the user has
to pay for the fraud and so users didn't want

00:48:48.979 --> 00:48:49.979
it.

00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:54.089
And then when the law said the bank has to
pay for the fraud, there's 50, you know the

00:48:54.089 --> 00:48:55.089
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Right.

00:48:55.089 --> 00:48:57.609
&gt;&gt;male #4: both the user or it was either
the user or the merchant, but somebody you

00:48:57.609 --> 00:49:00.950
know if the user has to pay for the fraud,
the users don't want it.

00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:02.910
So they say, well, let's make the merchants
pay for the fraud.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.920
Then the merchants don't want it.

00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:05.689
So they made the bank pay for the fraud.

00:49:05.689 --> 00:49:08.859
All of a sudden the liability and the incentives
are in the right place.

00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:12.469
And the banks fought against it, they said,
oh no, you can't make us pay for the fraud,

00:49:12.469 --> 00:49:17.029
it's not our fault, you know, then and you
know the law just said, well, pay for it anyway.

00:49:17.029 --> 00:49:18.759
Which then the banks said oh, all right.

00:49:18.759 --> 00:49:22.069
At which point credit cards had this amazing
round, you know, round of growth.

00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:26.720
Because the banks said, ok, well we'll cut
down the fraud to a level that we are willing

00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.519
to, that people are willing to pay for in
the interest rate.

00:49:29.519 --> 00:49:31.050
And so it's really just liability.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:32.170
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Right.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:37.430
I mean and I think today it's on the merchant
actually, is the fraud.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:43.800
I mean unless you know Visa and MasterCard,
you know, if you go through secure code, they

00:49:43.800 --> 00:49:48.599
have, if you what is the product called, MasterCard
Secure Code and Visa Verified.

00:49:48.599 --> 00:49:51.880
If you go through those mechanisms then the
bank takes the risk.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.910
But I think today it's the merchant still
takes, still takes the risk on transactions,

00:49:55.910 --> 00:49:56.910
right.

00:49:56.910 --> 00:50:01.699
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Hey, Kevin, I think we're
gonna broadcast this, so maybe just parting

00:50:01.699 --> 00:50:02.699
thoughts

00:50:02.699 --> 00:50:03.699
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, yeah, we're recorded.

00:50:03.699 --> 00:50:07.670
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: It's been inspiring hackers
or security researchers, for somebody that's

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:09.680
been there, done that, been behind bars.

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:14.710
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: [laughing] I mean, I just
love what I do.

00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:22.459
I mean I, my primary reason for getting involved
in the hacking was the intellectual curiosity,

00:50:22.459 --> 00:50:24.259
the challenge and most importantly the learning.

00:50:24.259 --> 00:50:30.199
And I wanted to learn everything that I possibly
could and I still have those drivers today.

00:50:30.199 --> 00:50:35.019
When I'm testing my client's security, I still
get that endorphin rush when I'm able to find

00:50:35.019 --> 00:50:36.390
a security hole.

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:40.349
So I really enjoy what I do, it's almost like
you know it's almost like not working, but

00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:46.319
I mean my recommendations is if you're developing
applications is you do use secure coding practices

00:50:46.319 --> 00:50:47.319
so people like me can't get in.

00:50:47.319 --> 00:50:50.869
You can make our pentests harder.

00:50:50.869 --> 00:50:52.400
Yeah.

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:57.939
And I, I, I guess unless you have any other
questions I don't know what else to say.

00:50:57.939 --> 00:50:59.150
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Check out the book.

00:50:59.150 --> 00:51:02.119
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Oh, yeah, book.

00:51:02.119 --> 00:51:03.369
Why am I here?

00:51:03.369 --> 00:51:08.250
Ghost in the Wires, I mean you get a lot more
detail about what had happened, why I did

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:10.769
it, how I did things, that's in the book.

00:51:10.769 --> 00:51:13.699
Again it was a two year, a two-year project.

00:51:13.699 --> 00:51:19.009
I told Bill what I wanted this book to be
was like a catch me if you can thriller, so

00:51:19.009 --> 00:51:24.949
we were able to take my, my story because
of all the crazy stuff I did as a kid and

00:51:24.949 --> 00:51:26.960
I thought we actually met the goal.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.539
And I'd love to hear your feedback.

00:51:28.539 --> 00:51:30.479
You'll have my e-mail address on my card.

00:51:30.479 --> 00:51:33.489
If you like the book, dislike it, find an
error, let me know.

00:51:33.489 --> 00:51:37.289
I definitely would appreciate it and I love
Google.

00:51:37.289 --> 00:51:44.229
You guys are, you guys, Google is my home
page on my browser and I do use Google Chrome

00:51:44.229 --> 00:51:47.660
and I loved touring your campus in Mountain
View, it was awesome, it was like a little

00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:48.660
city.

00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:52.319
So I think you guys are working for an awe-,
a great company.

00:51:52.319 --> 00:51:56.239
So thank you for being here and I have business
cards for everybody.

00:51:56.239 --> 00:52:01.160
I didn't run out, I just wanted to get, kill
some time until Eran came and was ready to

00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:02.160
interview, so.

00:52:02.160 --> 00:52:03.160
&gt;&gt;Eran Feigenbaum: Thank you.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:04.160
&gt;&gt;Kevin Mitnick: Thank you so much.

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.160
Thank you.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:05.329
[applause]
