00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:03.369 align:start position:0%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELCOME BACK.

00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.872 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'RE HERE WITH PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA -- SO THAT WAS GOOD.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:10.109 align:start position:0%
WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS
IRAN DEAL.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:11.277 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE FEELING VERY GOOD ABOUT
THAT.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.547 line:91%
I WANNA TALK TO YOU NOW -- YOU
SPOKE WITH THE VFW TODAY FOR

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.783 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUR VETERAN'S.

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.819 align:start position:0% line:91%
BOY, ROUGH RIDE FOR THE
VETERAN'S RECENTLY.

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:23.056 align:start position:0% line:91%
THIS TERRIBLE ATTACK IN
TENNESSEE.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:24.791 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HEARTBREAKING.

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:27.560 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: AND ALSO THOUGH A
SYSTEMIC ISSUE, AND I KNOW YOU

00:00:27.593 --> 00:00:31.130 align:start position:0% line:91%
RAISE IT WITH THE VA AND
HEALTHCARE.

00:00:31.163 --> 00:00:36.102 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WELL YOU KNOW THE SITUATION
WITH THE V.A. HAS ALWAYS BEEN,

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:41.274 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE MAKE A PROMISE BUT TOO OFTEN
UNDER RESOURCED.

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:46.045 line:91%
SO IT IS MY FIRM BELIEF WE HAVE
A SACRED DUTY TO THESE GUYS AND

00:00:46.078 --> 00:00:50.116 align:start position:0% line:91%
GALS THAT WHEN THEY HAVE SERVED
US AS BRAVELY AS THEY HAVE,

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN THEY COME HOME, WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE FOR THEM.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:57.924 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET
HISTORICALLY, IT'S BEEN

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:03.196 align:start position:0% line:91%
SHORT-CHANGED, WORSE IN THE
VIETNAM ERA WHEN THEY CAME BACK.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.032 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO
SYSTEMATICALLY ADD RESOURCES TO

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:13.873 line:91%
THE VA BUT YOU STILL HAVE THIS
MASSIVE STRUCTURE WITH MILLIONS

00:01:13.906 --> 00:01:16.209 align:start position:0% line:85%
OF PEOPLE BEING SERVED.

00:01:16.242 --> 00:01:19.979 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHAT WE'RE HAVING TO DO IS
SYSTEMATICALLY WORK THROUGH

00:01:20.012 --> 00:01:26.953 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOME OF THE CHALLENGES OF A BIG,
FREAKY BUREAUCRACY.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:29.122 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN WE HAVE THAT PROBLEM WITH
WAITING LISTS...

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:32.892 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOLKS ARE STILL TAKING
APPOINTMENTS DOWN ON PAPER.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.028 line:91%
AND WHEN YOU'VE GOT MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE NEEDING SERVICES,

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.830 line:85%
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK ANYMORE.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.901 line:91%
SO WE'VE NOW BEEN ABLE TO CUT
DOWN ON WAITING TIMES, REDUCE

00:01:41.934 --> 00:01:45.838 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE BACKLOG FOR DISABILITY
CLAIMS BY ABOUT 80%.

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.974 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT WE ALSO HAVE MORE AND MORE
PEOPLE COMING IN.

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:54.113 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE ALLOWED FOLKS WHO HAD
SYMPTOMS OF AGENT ORANGE FOR THE

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.915 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIRST TIME TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
CLAIMS.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.885 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT ADDED A COUPLE HUNDRED
THOUSAND PEOPLE.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.254 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS WE END TWO WARS, FOLKS COME
BACK.

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:08.761 line:91%
SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE 2.7 MILLION
MORE VETERANS SPEAKING SERVICES.

00:02:08.794 --> 00:02:13.366 line:91%
IF THE AMOUNT OF RESOURCES
DOESN'T CHANGE, THEN THEY GET

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:16.702 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHORT-CHANGED.

00:02:16.735 --> 00:02:20.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WE'VE GOT TO DO EFFICIENCY
WORK ON THE VA BUT WE ALSO ASKED

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:23.142 line:91%
CONGRESS TO GET OUT FROM UNDER
THE SEQUESTER, THIS IDEA WE JUST

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:26.012 line:91%
MAKE BLANKET BUDGET CUTS THAT
SOMEHOW THAT'S GOING TO IMPROVE

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:27.246 align:start position:0% line:85%
OUR ECONOMY.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.616 line:91%
AND THE VERY SAME FOLKS WHO ARE
GOING TO CUT SERVICES ARE THE

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:32.919 line:91%
FIRST ONES THEN TO SAY WHY ARE
THE FOLKS HAVING WAITING TIMES

00:02:32.952 --> 00:02:34.954 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO LONG.

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:38.057 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT'S A WAITING TIME
ISSUE, TO BE FAIR, HAPPENED FAR

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.291 align:start position:0%
BEFORE THE SEQUESTER.

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:43.129 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT BRINGS UP SORT OF A LARGER
ISSUE WHICH IS, YOU KNOW, GIVEN,

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:46.899 line:91%
OKAY, THERE IS A PARTY THAT
BELIEVES THAT GOVERNMENT DOES

00:02:46.932 --> 00:02:50.269 line:91%
NOT HAVE AS LARGE A ROLE TO PLAY
IN OUR LIVES AS THE PARTY THAT

00:02:50.302 --> 00:02:52.738 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU ARE WITH.

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:55.942 line:91%
WHICH MEANS INSTANCES INCUMBENT
MAY BE UPON THAT PARTY, THE ONE

00:02:55.975 --> 00:02:58.945 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT YOU ARE WITH, TO
DEMONSTRATE HOW THAT WILL

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.213 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WORK IN THE 21st CENTURY.

00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:05.952 line:91%
HOW CAN THE GOVERNMENT BE AGILE,
AND WITH THE V.A. SEEMS TO BE A

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:16.095 align:start position:0% line:91%
LARGER ISSUE, YOU CAME INTO
OFFICE IN 2009 EXPLICITLY SAYING

00:03:16.128 --> 00:03:17.396 size:84% position:42% line:91%
YOU SPEND A BILLION DOLLARS
PRYING TO GET OPERABILITY

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:18.965 size:81% position:41%
BETWEEN THE D.O.D AND V.A.

00:03:18.998 --> 00:03:22.068 align:start position:0% line:91%
COULDN'T DO IT AFTER... FIVE
YEARS?

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:23.970 align:start position:0% line:91%
WENT BACK AND SAID LET'S DO IT
SEPARATELY.

00:03:24.003 --> 00:03:24.937 align:start position:0% line:85%
MORE MONEY.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.205 align:start position:0% line:85%
THAT DIDN'T WORK.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:28.741 line:91%
NOW THEY'RE BACK, THE V.A.'S GOT
A PRETTY GOOD SYSTEM WAITING FOR

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:31.344 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE D.O.D.

00:03:31.377 --> 00:03:35.881 line:91%
THEY'VE NOT EVEN GONE OUT YET
WITH A $11 BILLION CONTRACT.

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:41.821 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU'RE RUNNING FOR OFFICE, YOU
KNOW WHERE EVERYBODY IS --

00:03:41.854 --> 00:03:44.757 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; SO THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.261 size:78% position:39% line:85%
A COUPLE THINGS I'LL SAY.

00:03:48.294 --> 00:03:50.263 align:start position:0% line:91%
NUMBER ONE, GOVERNMENT WORKS
BETTER NOW THAN IT PROBABLY EVER

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.699 line:85%
HAS GIVEN WHAT WE ASK IT TO DO.

00:03:53.732 --> 00:03:58.938 line:91%
AND ACROSS AGENCIES, THERE HAVE
BEEN ALL KINDS OF REFORMS AND

00:03:58.971 --> 00:04:03.409 line:91%
IMPROVEMENTS AND PEOPLE THERE
WORK HARD AND THEY CARE ABOUT

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:04.643 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS STUFF DEEPLY.

00:04:04.677 --> 00:04:10.216 line:91%
BUT WHAT IS TRUE IS IF YOU HAVE
A GOVERNMENT THAT WAS BUILT ON

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:16.222 align:start position:0% line:91%
1930 MODELS AND IT'S NOT
UPDATED, THEN THERE'S GOING TO

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:21.093 align:start position:0% line:91%
BE A GAP IN TERMS OF WHAT
THEY'RE DOING NOW RELATIVE TO

00:04:21.126 --> 00:04:23.729 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WHAT SOME OTHER FOLKS DO.

00:04:23.762 --> 00:04:26.799 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND I.T. IS PROBABLY THE BIGGEST
EXAMPLE OF THAT.

00:04:26.832 --> 00:04:30.236 size:84% position:42% line:91%
WE'RE HAVING TO COMPLETELY
REDESIGN HOW THE GOVERNMENT

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:33.372 line:91%
PURCHASES I.T. SERVICES, HOW IT
DOES DIGITAL, FROM SOUP TO NUTS.

00:04:33.405 --> 00:04:38.144 line:91%
AND PART OF IT IS THE WAY IT'S
BEEN SET UP IS THAT YOU HAVE THE

00:04:38.177 --> 00:04:45.017 align:start position:0% line:91%
SPECIFICATIONS THAT ARE THIS
THICK.

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.822 line:91%
WHEN ON A CHAIN AND SETTING UP
MY OPERATIONS I HAVE GUYS IN

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:53.893 align:start position:0% line:91%
T-SHIRTS IN A ROOM FIGURING OUT
HOW TO DO THIS THING.

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:55.928 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT'S NOT HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS
SET UP.

00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:59.398 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S SLOW AND IT DOESN'T
FUNCTION PROPERLY.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.867 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU ASKED ME WHAT I WANT TO DO
OVER THE NEXT 18 MONTHS.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:09.308 align:start position:0% line:91%
A LOT OF THIS STUFF DOESN'T
REQUIRE CONGRESS, BUT HOW IT IS

00:05:09.341 --> 00:05:12.478 line:91%
WE CAN REVAMP THE SYSTEMS AND
WE'VE DONE IT SUCCESSFULLY IN

00:05:12.511 --> 00:05:13.712 align:start position:0% line:85%
CERTAIN AREAS.

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:19.018 line:91%
BUT WHEN YOU'VE GOT TWO MILLION
EMPLOYEES THEN THERE ARE GOING

00:05:19.051 --> 00:05:23.255 line:85%
TO BE PLACES WHERE THIS SLIPS.

00:05:23.288 --> 00:05:25.124 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  TO SOME EXTENT THAT'S
THE POINT.

00:05:25.157 --> 00:05:27.860 line:91%
YOU GOT TWO MILLION EMPLOYEES
AND YOU WANT THIS TO BE AGILE.

00:05:27.893 --> 00:05:29.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE V.A. SYSTEM.

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:35.000 align:start position:0% line:91%
YOU CAN'T FIND A BETTER ISSUE
POLITICALLY.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:40.840 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU CAN'T -- YOU'LL FIND BUT
YOU'LL FIND ALMOST ANONYMOUS

00:05:40.873 --> 00:05:43.376 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AGREEMENT BUT WE HAVE FAILED
THESE VETERANS AND UNANIMOUS

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:45.845 line:91%
AGREEMENT THAT WE NEED TO DO
BETTER YET SEVEN YEARS INTO IT,

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:47.380 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
DEMONSTRATE --

00:05:47.413 --> 00:05:54.520 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WAIT WAIT -- THE REASON IT'S
BACK UP IS YOU GOT 2.7 MILLION

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:58.124 size:78% position:39%
NEW FOLKS COMING BACK IN.

00:05:58.157 --> 00:05:59.092 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WELL WHEN YOU START A
LOT  OF WARS -- IT'S GOTTA END.

00:05:59.125 --> 00:06:04.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; HOLD ON A SECOND. HERE'S THE
GENERAL POINT.

00:06:04.396 --> 00:06:09.168 line:91%
WE ASK OUR GOVERNMENT TO DO
THINGS THAT OTHER FOLKS DON'T

00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:14.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
WANT TO DO BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
MAKE MONEY AT IT.

00:06:14.206 --> 00:06:16.142 size:88% position:44% line:85%
BECAUSE IT'S NOT PROFITABLE.

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:19.111 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND SO WE WANT GOVERNMENT TO
HELP MAKE SURE THAT KIDS GET

00:06:19.144 --> 00:06:20.479 align:start position:0% line:85%
OPPORTUNITY.

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:24.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THEY HAVE TO REACH THE 
TOUGHEST TO REACH KIDS.

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:28.854 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE KIDS AT THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS
GENERALLY SCREEN OUT.

00:06:28.887 --> 00:06:31.056 line:91%
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE
SERVING OUR VETERANS INCLUDING

00:06:31.089 --> 00:06:36.028 line:85%
THE OLDEST, POOREST VETERANS.

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:37.496 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY IN
DOING THAT.

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.065 size:88% position:44% line:91%
AND SO A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE
WILL SAY WELL WHY ISN'T THIS

00:06:40.098 --> 00:06:42.301 size:88% position:44% line:85%
HAPPENING AS QUICK, AS FAST.

00:06:42.334 --> 00:06:48.073 line:91%
IF WE'RE UNDER RESOURCING OUR
GOVERNMENT AND NOT STAFFING IT

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:52.578 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE TO DO
EVERYTHING TO BE DONE, THEN

00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:56.115 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT
THERE ARE GOING TO BE GAPS.

00:06:56.148 --> 00:07:00.186 line:91%
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE CAN WE
MAKE STUFF A LOT BETTER THAN IT

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:06.992 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAS BEEN.

00:07:07.025 --> 00:07:08.126 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THE ENEMY OF GOOD.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.196 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt; PART OF THE PROBLEM IS I
THINK WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO,

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.664 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE.

00:07:11.697 --> 00:07:15.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN THERE WAS THAT PROBLEM WITH
THE IRS.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:19.472 line:85%
EVERYBODY JUMPED INCLUDING YOU.

00:07:19.505 --> 00:07:20.740 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE
IRS?

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:22.274 line:91%
&gt;&gt; LOOK YOU GOT THIS BACK OFFICE
AND THEY'RE GOING AFTER THE TEA

00:07:22.307 --> 00:07:23.475 align:start position:0% line:85%
PARTY.

00:07:23.508 --> 00:07:28.514 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT TURNED OUT NO, CONGRESS HAS A
CRUMMY LAW THAT DIDN'T GIVE

00:07:28.547 --> 00:07:31.417 align:start position:0% line:91%
PEOPLE GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF WHAT
THEY ARE TRYING TO DO.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.220 line:85%
THEY DID IT POORLY AND STUPIDLY.

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:39.325 align:start position:0% line:85%
BUT THAT BECOMES --

00:07:39.358 --> 00:07:42.595 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU REALLY ONLY DO HAVE
A YEAR LEFT.

00:07:42.628 --> 00:07:43.195 align:start position:0% line:85%
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.229 --> 00:07:45.264 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO -- BUT HOLD ON, JON.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:47.099 align:start position:0% line:85%
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

00:07:47.132 --> 00:07:48.901 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
THAT THERE WAS NOT SOME BIG

00:07:48.934 --> 00:07:50.002 align:start position:0% line:85%
CONSPIRACY THERE.

00:07:50.035 --> 00:07:52.271 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THEY WERE TRYING TO SORT OUT
THESE CONFLICTING DEMANDS.

00:07:52.304 --> 00:07:57.243 line:91%
YOU DON'T WANT ALL THIS MONEY
POURING THROUGH NOT-FOR-PROFITS

00:07:57.276 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start position:0% line:91%
BUT YOU ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE
EVERYBODY IS BEING TREATED

00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:05.484 align:start position:0% line:85%
FAIRLY.

00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:08.387 line:91%
THE REAL SCANDAL AROUND THE IRS
IS THAT IT HAS BEEN SO POORLY

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:12.725 line:91%
FUNDED THAT THEY CAN'T GO AFTER
THESE, WE CANNOT GO AFTER THESE

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:17.329 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOLKS WHO ARE DELIBERATELY
DELETING TAX PAYMENTS.

00:08:17.362 --> 00:08:22.401 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THE REAL SCANDAL IS TAX
CODES WHERE MULTINATIONALS CAN

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.070 align:start position:0% line:91%
PAY ZERO TAXES MAKING MASSIVE
PROFITS.

00:08:25.103 --> 00:08:28.607 line:91%
SO WE TEND TO GET DISTRACTED BY
THE FACT THAT THERE ARE GOING TO

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:36.448 line:91%
BE ELEMENTS, BECAUSE GOVERNMENT
IS A HUMAN ENTERPRISE WHERE,

00:08:36.481 --> 00:08:38.050 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE IS SCREWING
UP AT ANY GIVEN TIME.

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:39.151 size:84% position:42% line:85%
BECAUSE IT'S A HUGE SYSTEM.

00:08:39.184 --> 00:08:44.256 align:start position:0% line:91%
OVERALL, IT WORKS REALLY WELL TO
HELP A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:47.293 line:91%
WHAT THE SCANDALOUS IS THE FACT
THAT WE ARE NOT MAKING AS MUCH

00:08:47.326 --> 00:08:52.097 line:91%
PROGRESS AS WE SHOULD ON THE
BASIC THINGS THAT WE KNOW OUR

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.031 size:84% position:42% line:85%
GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE DOING.

00:08:53.065 --> 00:08:55.267 align:start position:0% line:91%
REBUILDING OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE, REBUILDING OUR

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.336 align:start position:0% line:91%
ROADS, REBUILDING OUR PORTS,
SETTING UP A SYSTEM FOR

00:08:57.369 --> 00:09:01.273 align:start position:0% line:91%
DISTRIBUTING ENERGY, MAKING SURE
WE HAVE EARLY CHILDHOOD

00:09:01.306 --> 00:09:03.742 align:start position:0% line:85%
EDUCATION.

00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:09.481 size:88% position:44% line:91%
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT
PART OF MY JOB FOR THE LAST

00:09:09.514 --> 00:09:13.452 line:91%
SEVEN YEARS AND PART OF MY JOB
OVER THESE LAST, THIS LAST YEAR

00:09:13.485 --> 00:09:15.788 size:84% position:42% line:91%
COMING UP IS TO CONTINUALLY
IMPROVE AND MAKE SURE THE

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:16.956 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOVERNMENT IS FUNCTIONING AS
WELL AS IT COULD.

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:21.060 line:91%
BUT YOU CAN'T USE THAT AS AN
EXCUSE FOR THE BIG STRUCTURAL

00:09:21.093 --> 00:09:24.163 line:91%
PROBLEMS THAT WE'RE FACING RIGHT
NOW THAT ARE NOT BEING ADDRESSED

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:29.301 align:start position:0% line:91%
ADDRESSED, TYPICALLY THAT HAS TO
BE --

00:09:29.334 --> 00:09:33.539 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO
GET TO IS THAT VISION OF WHAT

00:09:33.572 --> 00:09:37.643 align:start position:0% line:91%
21ST CENTURY GOVERNMENT LOOKS
LIKE OUTSIDE OF THE

00:09:37.676 --> 00:09:39.244 align:start position:0% line:85%
POLITICALIZATION OF IT.

00:09:39.277 --> 00:09:41.814 line:91%
HOW DO YOU GOVERN AND DO THE
SERVICES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:44.283 line:85%
WHILE BEING IN THAT SITUATION.

00:09:44.316 --> 00:09:47.219 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IF IT'S FOUR GUYS IN A
T-SHIRT, ISN'T THERE AN

00:09:47.252 --> 00:09:55.294 align:start position:0% line:91%
EXECUTIVE OPTION THAT CAN, THAT
CAN CUT THROUGH.

00:09:55.327 --> 00:09:56.228 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT WE DO.

00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:57.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YES, YOU'RE THE
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.

00:09:57.396 --> 00:10:00.566 size:88% position:44% line:91%
&gt;&gt;  AFTER THE HEALTHCARE.GOV
FIASCO, WE BROUGHT IN A TEAM

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:04.470 align:start position:0% line:91%
OF GUYS BASICALLY VOLUNTEERING
THEIR OWN TIME FROM GOOGLE,

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:08.107 size:84% position:42% line:85%
FACEBOOK, GUYS IN T-SHIRTS.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.342 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'RE NOT WEARING T-SHIRTS
NOW.

00:10:10.375 --> 00:10:13.679 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY'VE DRESSED UP A LITTLE BIT,
ALTHOUGH NOT THAT WELL.

00:10:13.712 --> 00:10:16.649 align:start position:0% line:85%
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:16.682 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WE HAVE CREATED WHAT
WE'RE CALLING THE U.S. DIGITAL

00:10:21.153 --> 00:10:25.391 align:start position:0% line:91%
SERVICES AND WE'RE
BASICALLY GETTING THEM IN FOR A

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:28.360 line:91%
YEAR OR TWO YEARS AND WE'RE JUST
PUTTING THEM ON A WHOLE BUNCH OF

00:10:28.393 --> 00:10:29.494 align:start position:0%
THESE PROBLEMS.

00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:34.133 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHETHER IT'S HOW DO WE MAKE AN
S.B.A. LOAN EASIER TO GET.

00:10:34.166 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0% line:91%
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS
AGENCY IS MORE CUSTOMER

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:38.938 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRIENDLY.

00:10:38.971 --> 00:10:42.741 line:91%
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE
CAN GO TO ONE WEBSITE INSTEAD OF

00:10:42.774 --> 00:10:44.810 align:start position:0% line:91%
16 TO FIND OUT THE INFORMATION
THEY NEED.

00:10:44.843 --> 00:10:48.080 line:91%
SO THESE GUYS ARE SPREADING OUT
THROUGHOUT THE GOVERNMENT AND

00:10:48.113 --> 00:10:52.284 line:91%
THEY ARE IN FACT SYSTEMATICALLY
CHIPPING AWAY AT A LOT OF THESE

00:10:52.317 --> 00:10:54.186 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROBLEMS.

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:59.425 line:91%
AND I THINK WE WILL, BY THE TIME
I LEAVE HERE, WE'RE GOING TO BE

00:10:59.458 --> 00:11:03.362 line:91%
ABLE TO SAY THAT GOVERNMENT IS
WORKING MUCH BETTER, MUCH MORE

00:11:03.395 --> 00:11:06.799 line:91%
EFFICIENTLY, MUCH MORE CUSTOMER
FRIENDLY THAN WHEN I CAME INTO

00:11:06.832 --> 00:11:07.967 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFFICE.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.537 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  IT FRUSTRATES YOU
BECAUSE I CAN TELL WE'RE TALKING

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.540 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVING A NICE TIME TALKING ABOUT
THE IRAN DEAL, I THINK IT'S

00:11:14.573 --> 00:11:15.808 align:start position:0% line:85%
FRUSTRATING TO YOU.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:17.009 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; OF COURSE.

00:11:17.042 --> 00:11:19.778 line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE
WE'RE AMPLIFYING THINGS OUT OF

00:11:19.811 --> 00:11:21.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
PROPORTION.

00:11:21.413 --> 00:11:24.216 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MIGHT AGREE WITH THAT ON
CERTAIN ISSUES.

00:11:24.249 --> 00:11:26.485 size:84% position:42% line:85%
&gt;&gt; THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TRUE.

00:11:26.518 --> 00:11:28.821 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: THE V.A. THOUGH, I WOULD
TAKE ISSUES --

00:11:28.854 --> 00:11:30.489 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO. 

00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:35.594 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE ISSUES WITH THE V.A. IS --
IF THERE'S ONE VETERNA NOT

00:11:35.627 --> 00:11:38.497 align:start position:0% line:91%
GETTING THE SERVICES THEY NEED,
THEN WE'RE FAILING THAT

00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:39.865 align:start position:0% line:91%
VERTERAN, AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY
CRITICAL.

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:47.272 align:start position:0% line:91%
LET'S TALK ABOUT
HOMLESSNESS AMONG VETERANS.

00:11:47.305 --> 00:11:48.874 size:81% position:41% line:85%
WE'VE CUT THAT BY A THIRD.

00:11:48.907 --> 00:11:50.843 line:91%
WE'VE GOT TWO THIRDS OF THESE
FOLKS WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:52.544 line:91%
HAVE PROPER HOUSING BECAUSE IF
THEY FOUGHT FOR US THEY SHOULD

00:11:52.577 --> 00:11:53.645 line:91%
BE ABLE TO FIND A HOME HERE IN
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

00:11:53.678 --> 00:11:54.613 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  SURE.

00:11:54.646 --> 00:12:00.486 align:start position:0% line:85%
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:04.590 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT THIS GOES FOR THE
LARGER POINT.

00:12:04.623 --> 00:12:05.724 line:91%
YOU ASKED ME HOW AM I DOING AND
AM I FEELING PRETTY GOOD RIGHT

00:12:05.757 --> 00:12:08.460 align:start position:0% line:85%
NOW.

00:12:08.493 --> 00:12:14.933 line:91%
ONE OF THE THINGS I'M PROUD OF,
AND THIS IS NOT JUST ME, IS WE

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:18.237 align:start position:0% line:91%
HAVE LOOKED AT A WHOLE SLEW OF
PROBLEMS WHEN WE CAME INTO

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:19.505 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFFICE.

00:12:19.538 --> 00:12:24.343 line:91%
AND WE SAID WHERE CAN WE ADVANCE
THE BALL DOWN THE FIELD EACH AND

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:28.514 size:88% position:44% line:85%
EVERY TIME ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:12:28.547 --> 00:12:33.218 line:91%
AND WE DON'T SCORE A TOUCH DOWN
EVERY TIME, BUT WE MOVE THE BALL

00:12:33.251 --> 00:12:37.422 align:start position:0% line:85%
FORWARD.

00:12:37.455 --> 00:12:38.457 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  DO YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'VE HIT THE METRICS THAT YOU

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:39.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
WANTED TO HIT.

00:12:39.725 --> 00:12:41.994 line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO FALL
SHORT BECAUSE IF YOU'RE HITTING

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:43.929 line:91%
YOUR MARK THAT MEANS YOU DIDN'T
SET THEM HIGH ENOUGH, RIGHT.

00:12:43.962 --> 00:12:45.631 align:start position:0% line:85%
SO IN HEALTHCARE --

00:12:45.664 --> 00:12:48.634 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  AM I BEING UNREASONABLE
TO YOU, AM I BEING UNFAIR

00:12:48.667 --> 00:12:55.574 line:91%
SUGGESTING IN THIS ONE INSTANCE,
GOVERNMENT FAILED TO ADDRESS A

00:12:55.607 --> 00:12:58.744 align:start position:0% line:91%
PROBLEM IN AN APPROPRIATE TIME
FRAME, FAILED TO DO IT --

00:12:58.777 --> 00:13:05.551 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK YOU'RE BEING ENTIRELY
FAIR THAT THE VA HAS NOT DONE

00:13:05.584 --> 00:13:07.719 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO IN TERMS OF
OUR VETERANS, OKAY.

00:13:07.752 --> 00:13:10.956 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT IS SOMETHING THAT'S BUILT
UP OVER 50 YEARS.

00:13:10.989 --> 00:13:14.927 line:85%
AND THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES --

00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:15.761 size:81% position:41% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon: WHOSE FAULT IS IT.

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:16.995 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  NO, NO, NO.

00:13:17.029 --> 00:13:24.436 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO WE
SET THE RIGHT BENCHMARKS SO THAT

00:13:24.469 --> 00:13:26.872 line:91%
WE KNOW WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS
AND WE'RE MOVING IN THE RIGHT

00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:27.639 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIRECTION.

00:13:27.673 --> 00:13:28.907 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND THAT'S TRUE ON ALL THIS
STUFF.

00:13:28.941 --> 00:13:33.478 line:91%
WHEN WE PASSED HEALTHCARE, THERE
WAS A LOT OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT A

00:13:33.511 --> 00:13:35.581 align:start position:0% line:91%
SINGLE PAYER PLAN WOULD BE
BETTER.

00:13:35.614 --> 00:13:38.617 line:91%
WE NEED A PUBLIC OPTION OR THE
WHOLE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:43.555 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND A LOT OF THOSE SUGGESTIONS I
AGREED WITH.

00:13:43.588 --> 00:13:48.594 line:91%
BUT WHAT I KNEW WAS, GIVEN THE
LEGACY SYSTEM WE'VE INHERITED,

00:13:48.627 --> 00:13:51.830 align:start position:0% line:91%
GIVEN THE POLITICS OF THIS
COUNTRY, GIVEN PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:54.566 line:91%
AFRAID OF SOMETHING NEW, GIVEN
OBSTRUCTION AND RESISTANCE FROM

00:13:54.599 --> 00:13:56.602 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE OTHER SIDE.

00:13:56.635 --> 00:14:00.505 align:start position:0% line:91%
FOR US TO GET THIS DONE AND
SUDDENLY HAVE 16 MILLION PEOPLE

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:04.977 line:91%
WHO HAVE HEALTHCARE WHO DIDN'T
HAVE IT BEFORE AND A HUNDRED

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:08.714 size:88% position:44% line:91%
PLUS MILLION PEOPLE WHO KNOW
THAT IF THEY LOSE THEIR JOB

00:14:08.747 --> 00:14:11.416 size:88% position:44% line:91%
TOMORROW, THEY CAN STILL GET
HEALTHCARE EVEN IF THEY GOT

00:14:11.449 --> 00:14:15.821 align:start position:0% line:85%
PREEXISTING CONDITION.

00:14:15.854 --> 00:14:19.424 line:91%
KNOWING THAT A WHOLE BUNCH OFIAN
PEOPLE SUDDENLY ARE ABLE TO GET

00:14:19.457 --> 00:14:20.726 align:start position:0% line:91%
HEALTHCARE UNDER THEIR PARENTS
PLAN? I'LL TAKE THAT.

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:23.662 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND GOING BACK TO THE IRAN
DEAL --

00:14:23.695 --> 00:14:24.830 align:start position:0% line:85%
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:24.863 --> 00:14:29.735 line:91%
THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO SAY WELL
ON IRAN, WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST

00:14:29.768 --> 00:14:36.742 align:start position:0% line:91%
COMPLETELY ELIMINATE ALL
VEST VESTIGES OF ANY

00:14:36.775 --> 00:14:38.110 size:78% position:39%
NUCLEAR PROGRAM PROGRAMS.

00:14:38.143 --> 00:14:39.078 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERE'S THE REASON.

00:14:39.111 --> 00:14:40.212 align:start position:0% line:91%
A, THERE'S NO REASON THEY WOULD
EVER DO THAT.

00:14:40.245 --> 00:14:44.549 align:start position:0% line:91%
B, THE REASON WE GOT THEM TO THE
TABLE IS BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:14:44.582 --> 00:14:46.752 line:91%
COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND RUSSIA
EVEN WITH ALL THE DISAGREEMENTS

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:48.654 line:91%
WE HAVE, WE'RE ABLE TO ORGANIZE
THEM TO FOCUS, MAKING SURE THEY

00:14:48.687 --> 00:14:51.356 align:start position:0% line:85%
DIDN'T HAVE A BOMB.

00:14:51.389 --> 00:14:53.825 line:91%
AND TO KEEP THAT INTERNATIONAL
COALITION TOGETHER AND SANCTIONS

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:59.698 line:91%
TOGETHER, WHAT THAT MEANT WAS WE
HAD TO TAKE SOME CONSIDERATION

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:02.668 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTO IRAN'S SAVING FACE AS THEY
MOVE FORWARD ON THIS DEAL.

00:15:02.701 --> 00:15:09.074 align:start position:0% line:91%
AS LONG AS WE KNEW THEY WEREN'T
GOING TO GET A BOMB.

00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:15.948 line:91%
I GUESS WHAT I'M SAYING JON IS
THAT IT'S NOT YOUR JOB TO FOCUS

00:15:15.981 --> 00:15:17.983 line:91%
ON WHAT THREE QUARTERS OF WHAT
YOU GET YOUR JOB IS TO POINTED

00:15:18.016 --> 00:15:19.618 size:84% position:42% line:85%
OUT WHAT WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN.

00:15:19.651 --> 00:15:22.888 line:91%
THAT'S WHY OUR DEMOCRACY WORKS
IS BECAUSE WE KEEP ON MAKING

00:15:22.921 --> 00:15:24.756 align:start position:0% line:85%
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:15:24.789 --> 00:15:25.657 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU'RE GOING TO GO
WITH THIS WHOLE

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:26.959 align:start position:0%
SANDWICH ANALOGY.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:29.528 align:start position:0% line:85%
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:29.561 --> 00:15:33.432 size:84% position:42% line:91%
&gt;&gt; BUT WHAT WE CAN'T LOSE
SIGHT OF, I GUESS WHAT I DO

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:34.032 align:start position:0%
FIGHT AGAINST --

00:15:34.065 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I FEEL IT.

00:15:34.833 --> 00:15:35.768 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:15:35.801 --> 00:15:37.402 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I FELT THE MOOD CHAN
GE. I FELT  IT.

00:15:37.435 --> 00:15:39.705 line:85%
&gt;&gt; HERE'S WHAT I FIGHT AGAINST.

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:43.642 line:91%
WHAT I FIGHT AGAINST IS THAT
CYNICISM, I'M NOT SAYING -- THE

00:15:43.675 --> 00:15:49.982 line:91%
CYNICISM THAT IS FED BY THIS
NOTION THAT GOVERNMENT DOESN'T

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:52.084 align:start position:0% line:85%
GET STUFF DONE.

00:15:52.117 --> 00:15:57.756 line:91%
AND THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS
THAT WHETHER IT'S OUR MILITARY

00:15:57.789 --> 00:16:06.665 line:91%
OR ALL KINDS OF PUBLIC SERVANTS
IN THE VA OR IN AG OR IN ALL OF

00:16:06.698 --> 00:16:10.168 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE AGENCIES THAT WORK AT IT,
EVERY SINGLE DAY THERE'S A BUNCH

00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:14.706 line:91%
OF STUFF THAT IS GETTING DONE
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND

00:16:14.739 --> 00:16:19.044 align:start position:0% line:85%
HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE.

00:16:19.077 --> 00:16:24.850 line:91%
AND IF THOSE OF US WHO BELIEVE
THE GOVERNMENT HAS SOME, IN THE

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:27.686 align:start position:0% line:91%
INTEREST OF FAIRNESS OR
OBJECTIVITY OR WHAT HAVE YOU,

00:16:27.719 --> 00:16:32.657 line:91%
DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE AND FOCUS ON
THE ENORMOUS SUCCESSES BUT ALSO

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:34.159 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE FACT THAT YES THERE'S A
HUMAN ENTERPRISE, THERE'S GOING

00:16:34.192 --> 00:16:35.227 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO BE SOME TRADE OFFS.

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:40.766 align:start position:0% line:91%
THERE'S GOING TO BE SOMEBODY
SOMEWHERE SCREWING OFF.

00:16:40.799 --> 00:16:45.771 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHEN PROBLEMS COME UP THEY
SHOULD BE FIXED.

00:16:45.804 --> 00:16:47.973 align:start position:0% line:91%
SOMETIMES NOT AS FAST AS THEY
SHOULD.

00:16:48.006 --> 00:16:49.708 line:91%
WHEN WE LOSE SIGHT OF THAT WE
ARE LEADING INTO THIS NARRATIVE

00:16:49.741 --> 00:16:52.110 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT BASICALLY SAYS THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO.

00:16:52.143 --> 00:16:56.014 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEN WHAT WE GET ARE THE PROTEST
MOVEMENTS ON THE LEFT OR THE

00:16:56.047 --> 00:16:57.248 align:start position:0% line:85%
RIGHT.

00:16:57.282 --> 00:17:00.819 line:91%
TO SOME DEGREE THE TEA PARTY IS
AN EXPRESSION OF FRUSTRATION.

00:17:00.852 --> 00:17:02.788 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY SEE A BUNCH OF STUFF GOING
ON THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:17:02.821 --> 00:17:07.592 align:start position:0% line:91%
THEY FEEL THREATENED BY AND THEY
REACT.

00:17:07.625 --> 00:17:09.828 align:start position:0% line:85%
INCLUDING ME.

00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:11.263 align:start position:0% line:85%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:13.598 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  YOU MAKE THEM SOUND
LIKE BUNNIES.

00:17:13.631 --> 00:17:16.268 align:start position:0% line:85%
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:16.301 --> 00:17:20.238 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; SO I JUST, I MEAN THE
ONE THING THAT I FEEL DEEPLY

00:17:20.271 --> 00:17:24.109 line:91%
ABOUT, AND THIS IS SOMETHING I
FEEL DEEPLY ABOUT WHEN I LEAVE

00:17:24.142 --> 00:17:29.881 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOVERNMENT IS STUFF GETS
BETTER IF WE WORK AT IT AND WE

00:17:29.914 --> 00:17:33.251 align:start position:0% line:91%
STAY FOCUSED ON WHERE WE'RE
GOING.

00:17:33.284 --> 00:17:36.655 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT DOESN'T IMMEDIATELY GET ALL
SOLVED.

00:17:36.688 --> 00:17:39.558 line:91%
AND I WARNED AGAINST THIS WHEN I
WAS RUNNING FOR OFFICE BECAUSE

00:17:39.591 --> 00:17:41.860 line:91%
EVERYBODY HAD HOPE POSTERS AND
THIS AND THAT AND EVERYBODY WAS

00:17:41.893 --> 00:17:43.795 align:start position:0% line:85%
FEELING --

00:17:43.828 --> 00:17:45.897 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  HEY WE DIDN'T
MAKE THOSE, YOU MADE THOSE.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.265 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; NO, NO.

00:17:47.298 --> 00:17:51.203 align:start position:0% line:85%
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:54.039 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: I'M PRETTY SURE THAT
CAME FROM YOU.

00:17:54.072 --> 00:17:58.043 line:91%
&gt;&gt; WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT IF
YOU LOOK AT WHAT I SAID AT THE

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:01.046 align:start position:0% line:91%
TIME, I SAID THIS IS GOING TO
BE AN ONGOING PROJECT.

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:02.881 line:85%
AND IT'S A PROJECT OF CITIZENS.

00:18:02.914 --> 00:18:09.921 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT JUST FIX THIS.

00:18:09.954 --> 00:18:12.791 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT'S HOW DO WE WORK TOGETHER TO
GET THINGS DONE.

00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:16.027 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND IT ISN'T PERFECT BUT OVER
TIME IT GETS BETTER.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.796 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND HERE'S THE THING I CAN SAY,
JON.

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:19.798 line:85%
I CAN SAY THIS UNEQUIVOCALLY.

00:18:19.831 --> 00:18:24.836 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE V.A. IS BETTER NOW THAN WHEN
I CAME INTO OFFICE.

00:18:24.869 --> 00:18:25.904 align:start position:0% line:91%
IT IS BETTER NOW THAN WHEN I
CAME INTO OFFICE.

00:18:25.937 --> 00:18:28.340 align:start position:0% line:91%
GOVERNMENT WORKS BETTER THAN
WHEN I CAME INTO OFFICE.

00:18:28.373 --> 00:18:31.910 line:91%
THE ECONOMY BY EVERY METRIC IS
BETTER THAN WHEN I CAME INTO

00:18:31.943 --> 00:18:33.178 align:start position:0% line:85%
OFFICE.

00:18:33.211 --> 00:18:36.081 line:91%
AND SO THE REASON I CAN SLEEP AT
NIGHT IS I SAID TO MYSELF DO YOU

00:18:36.114 --> 00:18:38.583 align:start position:0% line:85%
KNOW WHAT, IT'S BETTER.

00:18:38.616 --> 00:18:40.919 align:start position:0% line:85%
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:41.753 line:85%
NOW, AM I SATISFIED WITH IT? NO.

00:18:41.786 --> 00:18:42.988 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SHOULD VOTERS BE SATISFIED
WITH IT?

00:18:43.021 --> 00:18:46.892 line:91%
ABSOLUTELY NOT BECAUSE OTHERWISE
IF WE GET COMPLACENT AND LAZY,

00:18:46.925 --> 00:18:50.162 size:81% position:41% line:85%
THEN STUFF DOESN'T HAPPEN.

00:18:50.195 --> 00:18:54.299 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon: NO, THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT
I WAS SAYING.

00:18:54.332 --> 00:18:55.634 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; YOU AND ME, WE'RE RIGHT
THERE.

00:18:55.667 --> 00:18:56.201 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  CAN I TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

00:18:56.234 --> 00:18:57.302 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; YOU CAN.

00:18:57.335 --> 00:18:59.004 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; Jon:  I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
WE ARE COMMERCIAL WISE.

00:18:59.037 --> 00:19:02.607 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'M GOING TO, I'M GOING TO JUST
THROW TO COMMERCIAL.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.375 align:start position:0% line:85%
HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

00:19:03.408 --> 00:19:04.943 size:78% position:39% line:85%
WE'LL GO TO A COMMERCIAL.

00:19:04.976 --> 00:19:05.977 line:85%
WE'LL COME BACK AND TALK MORE.

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:07.946 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
NEXT.

00:19:07.979 --> 00:19:11.016 align:start position:0% line:91%
I'LL LEAVE IT UP TO YOU,
WHATEVER THE SUBJECT MATTER IS.

00:19:11.049 --> 00:19:14.052 align:start position:0% line:91%
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE
FROM PRESIDENT OBAMA.
