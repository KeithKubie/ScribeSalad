00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.170
Let's see if we can take the
integral of cosine of 5x over e

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.540
to the sine of 5x dx.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.340
And there's a crow squawking
outside of my window,

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.440
so I'll try to stay focused.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.800
So let's think about
whether u-substitution

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.030
might be appropriate.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.830
Your first temptation
might have said, hey,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.430
maybe we let u equal sine of 5x.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.510
And if u is equal
to sine of 5x, we

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.220
have something that's
pretty close to du up here.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.300
Let's verify that.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.980
So du could be equal to--
so du dx, derivative of u

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:33.936
with respect to x.

00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:35.310
Well, we just use
the chain rule.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.990
Derivative of 5x is 5.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.900
Times the derivative of sine
of 5x with respect to 5x,

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.700
that's just going
to be cosine of 5x.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.990
If we want to write this
into differential form, which

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.060
is useful when we do
our u-substitution,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:54.500
we could say that du is
equal to 5 cosine 5x.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.550
And we look over here, we
don't have quite du there.

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.260
We have just cosine of 5x dx.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.584
Cosine of 5x dx just like that.

00:01:04.584 --> 00:01:06.875
So when you look over here,
you have a cosine of 5x dx,

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.050
but we don't have a
5 cosine of 5x dx.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.450
But we know how to solve that.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.380
We can multiply by
5 and divide by 5.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.800
1/5 times 5 is
just going to be 1,

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.810
so we haven't changed the
value of the expression.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:29.390
When we do it this way, we see
pretty clearly we have our u

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.306
and we have our du.

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:33.100
Our du is 5.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.000
Let me circle that.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.650
Let me do that in that blue
color-- is 5 cosine of 5x dx.

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.440
So we can rewrite
this entire expression

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.500
as-- do that 1/5 in purple.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.130
This is going to
be equal to 1/5--

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.920
I hope you don't hear
that crow outside.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.360
He's getting quite obnoxious.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:02:03.590
1/5 times the integral of all
the stuff in blue is my du,

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.662
and then that is
over e to the u.

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:15.420
So how do we take the
antiderivative of this?

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.420
Well, you might be tempted to
well, what would you do here?

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.080
Well, we're still not
quite ready to simply take

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.680
the antiderivative here.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.830
If I were to rewrite
this, I could rewrite this

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.400
as this is equal to 1/5
times the integral of e

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.810
to the negative u du.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.170
And so what might
jump out at you

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.950
is maybe we do
another substitution.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.320
We've already used the letter
u, so maybe we'll use w.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.150
We'll do some w-substitution.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.110
And you might be able
to do this in your head,

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.200
but we'll do
w-substitution just to make

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.062
it a little bit clearer.

00:02:57.062 --> 00:02:59.270
This would have been really
useful if this was just e

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.680
to the u because we know the
antiderivative of e to the u

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.430
is just e to the u.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.429
So let's try to get it
in terms of the form of e

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:07.240
to the something and not e
to the negative something.

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.210
So let's set.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.330
And I'm running
out of colors here.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.280
Let's set w as
equal to negative u.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.170
In that case, then
dw, derivative

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.052
of w with respect
to u, is negative 1.

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:26.330
Or if we were to write that
statement in differential form,

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.110
dw is equal to du times
negative 1 is negative du.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.730
So this right over
here would be our w.

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.110
And do we have a dw here?

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.210
Well, we have just a du.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.270
We don't have a
negative du there.

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:46.190
But we can create a negative
du by multiplying this inside

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.780
by a negative 1, but then also
by multiplying the outside

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:49.535
by a negative 1.

00:03:49.535 --> 00:03:51.460
Negative 1 times
negative 1 is positive 1.

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.860
We haven't changed the value.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.630
We have to do both of these
in order for it to make sense.

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:56.930
Or I could do it like this.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.960
So negative 1 over here and a
negative 1 right over there.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.990
And if we do it in that form,
then this negative 1 times du,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:09.540
that's the same
thing as negative du.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.020
This is this right over here.

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:17.380
And so we can
rewrite our integral.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.459
It's going to be equal to now
it's going to be negative 1/5.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.100
Trying to use the
colors as best as I can.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.100
Negative 1/5 times the
indefinite integral of e

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.340
to the-- well,
instead of negative u,

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.670
we can write w-- e to the w.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.610
And instead of du times
negative 1, or negative du,

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.510
we can write dw.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.300
Now this simplifies
things a good bit.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.340
We know what the antiderivative
of this is in terms of w.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:02.910
This is going to be equal
to negative 1/5 e to the w.

00:05:06.244 --> 00:05:08.450
And then we might have
some constant there,

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.220
so I'll just do a plus c.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.120
And now we just have to do
all of our unsubstituting.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.000
So we know that w is
equal to negative u.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.020
So we could write that.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.860
So this is equal
to negative 1/5.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.740
I want to stay
true to my colors.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:35.510
Negative 1/5 e to the negative
u, that's what w is equal to,

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.515
plus c.

00:05:36.515 --> 00:05:38.830
But we're still not
done unsubstituting.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.842
We know that u is
equal to sine of 5x.

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:45.520
u is equal to sine of
5x, so we can write this

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:55.290
as being equal to
negative 1/5 times e

00:05:55.290 --> 00:06:05.100
to the negative u, which is
negative u is sine of 5x.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.080
And then finally,
we have our plus c.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.370
Now, there was a simpler way
that we could have done this

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.890
by just doing one substitution.

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:17.140
But then you would have had
to look ahead a little bit

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.580
and realize that it was not
trivial to take your-- not too

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.871
bad to take your antiderivative
of e to the negative u.

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:26.370
The insight that you might have
had-- although you shouldn't

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.755
really hold yourself,
feel too bad if you

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:31.130
didn't see that insight-- is
that we could have rewritten

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.020
that original integral--
and let me rewrite it.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:45.280
It's cosine of 5x over
e to the sine of 5x dx.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.460
We could have written this
entire original integral

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:52.910
as being equal to
cosine of 5x times e

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:57.710
to the negative sine of 5x dx.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.240
And in this situation,
we could have set u

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.710
to be equal to negative
5x and say, well,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:06.640
if u is equal to
negative sine of 5x.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:10.030
If u is equal to
negative sine of 5x,

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.590
then du is going to be equal
to negative 5 cosine of 5x.

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.282
And we don't have a
negative-- oh, dx.

00:07:19.282 --> 00:07:21.740
We don't have a negative 5
here, but we could construct one

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.440
by putting a negative 5
there and then multiplying

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.780
by negative 1/5.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.120
And then that would have
immediately simplified

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.110
this integral right over here
to be equal to negative 1/5

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:40.430
times the integral of
well, we have our du.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.330
Let me do this in
a different color.

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:44.640
We have our du.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.714
That's the negative 5.

00:07:46.714 --> 00:07:47.630
Let me do it this way.

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.855
Negative 5 cosine of 5x dx.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.030
So that is our du.

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:56.550
I'm just changing the
order of multiplication.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:00.620
Times e to the u.

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.080
This whole thing now is u
this second time around.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:06.390
So if we did it this way,
with just one substitution,

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:09.180
we could have immediately gotten
to the result that we wanted.

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.170
You take the
antiderivative of this.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.070
I'll do it in one color
now just because I

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.130
think you get the idea.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:20.922
This is equal to negative
1/5 e to the u plus c.

00:08:20.922 --> 00:08:24.790
u is equal to
negative sine of 5x.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:27.620
So this is equal
to negative 1/5 e

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:35.020
to the negative sine of
5x plus c And you're done.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:36.480
So this one is faster.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.022
It's simpler.

00:08:37.022 --> 00:08:38.479
And over time, you
might even start

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:39.950
being able to do
this in your head.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.419
This top one, you
still didn't mess up

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:44.409
by just setting u
equal to sine of 5x,

00:08:44.409 --> 00:08:46.450
we just have to do an
extra substitution in order

00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:49.270
to work it through all the way.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:53.160
And I was able to do this
video despite the crowing crow

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.460
outside, or squawking crow.
