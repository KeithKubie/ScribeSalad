00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.740
I can be smooth and charming and slick. I
can make a very confident impression and

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.780
it's hard to leave me at a loss for words.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.120
Sometimes I find myself fantasizing about
unlimited success and power, and beauty.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.390
I have repeatedly used deceit to cheat, con,
or defraud others for my personal gain. To

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.400
be honest, I don't have much concern for the
feelings of other people, or their suffering.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.689
Doesn't sound like the Hank you know, does
it?

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.400
These are all statements from the Self-Assessment
measure for Personality Disorders, that lets

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.200
patients describe themselves, ranking each statement
in terms of how accurate they think it is.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.100
To be honest, you can't rely too much on this
kind of self-reporting to assess what we are

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.500
talking about today because while some people
who are over-confident or obsessed with power

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.579
or downright deceitful might tell you that
they are, there is a certain subset that won't.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.670
Many of the disorders that we have talked
about so far are considered, "ego-dystonic"

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.900
meaning that people who have them are aware
that they have a problem and tend to be

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.340
distressed by their symptoms.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.020
Like a person with Bipolar Disorder or OCD
generally knows that they have a psychological

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.430
condition and they don't like what it does
to them.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.110
But some disorders are trickier then that.
They are "ego-syntonic," the person experiencing

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:09.490
them doesn't necessarily think that they have
a problem and sometimes, they think the problem

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.650
is with everyone else.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.400
Personality disorders fall into this category.
These are psychological disorders marked by

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.640
inflexible, disruptive, and enduring behavior
patterns that impair social and other functioning

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.299
-- whether the sufferer recognizes that or not.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.710
Unlike many other conditions that we've talked
about, personality disorders are often considered

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.130
to be chronic and enduring syndromes that
create noticeable problems in life.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.040
And as you can tell from these self assessment
statements, they can range from relatively

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.549
harmless displays of narcissism, to a true
and troubling lack of empathy for other people.

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.220
Not only can personality disorders be difficult
to diagnose and understand, they can also

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.899
be downright scary. Most of the extreme and
severe disorders go by names that you probably

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:54.019
recognize: psychopathy and sociopathy. I'm talking,
like, serial killers here, mob bosses, Vlad the Impaler.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.560
Cultures have been studying human personality
characteristics for thousands of years, but

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.800
the concept of personality disorders is a
much newer idea.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.569
Much of our modern classifications of these
disorders are based on the work of German

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.370
psychiatrist, Kurt Schneider, who was one
of the earliest researchers into what was

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.140
then known as psychopathy and published a
treatise on the study in 1923.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.730
Today, the DSM 5 contains ten distinct personality
disorder diagnoses, grouped into three clusters.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.930
The first cluster, cluster A, includes what
are often labeled simply as "odd" or "eccentric"

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.019
personality characteristics. For example,
someone with paranoid personality disorder

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.730
may feel a pervasive distrust of others and
be constantly guarded and suspicious while

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.950
a person with a schizoid personality disorder
would seem overly aloof and indifferent, showing

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.940
no interest in relationships and few emotional
responses.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.099
Cluster B encompasses dramatic emotional or
impulsive personality characteristics. For

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.400
example, a narcissistic personality can display
a selfish grandiose sense of self-importance

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.379
and entitlement. Meanwhile, a histrionic personality
might seem like they're acting a part to get

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.239
attention, even putting themselves at risk
with dramatic, dangerous, and even suicidal

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.480
gestures. The behavior of Cluster B can be
truly self-destructive and frightening, and

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.180
these disorders are often associated with
frequent hospitalization.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.950
Finally, Cluster C encompasses anxious, fearful,
or avoidant personality traits. For example,

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.810
those with avoidant and dependent personality
disorders often avoid meeting new people or

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.159
taking risks and show a lack of confidence,
an excessive need to be taken care of, and

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:34.150
a tremendous fear of being abandoned. Now,
in the past, and, to a great extent, today,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.459
some of these categories have been controversial.
Many researchers argue that some of these

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.999
conditions overlap with each other so much
that it can be impossible to tease them apart.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.100
Narcissistic personality disorder, for example,
has many traits that resemble histrionic personality

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.840
disorder. And because of this gray area, the
most commonly diagnosed personality disorder

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.110
is actually personality disorder not otherwise
specified or PDNOS. The prevalence of this

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.640
diagnosis suggests that while clinicians can
identify a personality disorder in a patient,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.900
figuring out the details of the condition
can be messy and difficult.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.870
One proposed alternative for diagnosing these
disorders is the Dimensional Model, which,

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.870
in essence, gets rid of discrete disorders
and replaces them with a range of personality

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.109
traits or symptoms, rating each person on
each dimension. So the Dimensional Model would

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.030
assess a patient not with the aim of diagnosing
one disorder or another, but instead, simply

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.680
finding out that they rank high on say, narcissism
and avoidance. It's a work in progress, so

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.000
with another generation, the clinical definition of
"personality disorder" may evolve pretty radically.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.780
One of the best-studied personality disorders
right now is Borderline Personality Disorder,

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.330
or BPD. Borderline makes it sounds like patients
are like, pretty close to being healthy, but

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.889
not quite, but that is not at all the case.
BPD sufferers have often learned to use dysfunctional,

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:50.810
unhealthy ways to get their basic psychological
needs met, like love and validation, by using

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.550
things like outbursts of rage, or on the other
end of the spectrum, self-injury behaviors

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:01.150
like cutting or worse. People with BPD were
once commonly maligned by clinicians as 'difficult'

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.430
or 'attention-seeking', but we now understand
BPD as a complicated set of learned behaviors

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.050
and emotional responses to traumatic or neglectful
environments, particularly in childhood. In

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.520
a sense, people with this disorder learn that
rage or self-harm helped them cope with traumatic

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.440
situations, but as a result, they also end
up using them in non-traumatic situations.

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.680
Although challenging for patients and clinicians
alike, the good news is that some psychotherapies

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.870
have helped even the most severely suffering,
repeatedly hospitalized BPD patients.

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.400
But probably the most famous well-established,
and frankly, troubling personality disorder

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.980
is Antisocial Personality Disorder. Now, you've heard
of this before, but maybe by one of its now

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.320
somewhat out of vogue synonyms, "psychopathy"
or "sociopathy." People with Antisocial Personality

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:48.660
Disorder, usually men, exhibit a lack of conscience
for wrongdoing, even towards friends and family

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.490
members. Their destructive behavior surfaces
in childhood or adolescence, beginning with

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.830
excessive lying, fighting, stealing, violence,
or manipulation. As adults, people with this

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.069
disorder are thought to generally end up in
one of two situations: either they are unable

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:05.819
to keep a job and engage in violent criminal
or similarly dysfunctional behavior; or they

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:11.180
become clever, charming con-artists, or ruthless
executives who make their way to positions

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.449
of power. Tony Soprano would have qualified
for a diagnosis, even if he wasn't nearly

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:20.300
as bad as, say, serial killer Ted Bundy or
Vlad the Impaler, the infamous 15th century

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.430
Romanian prince who personally watched about
100,000 people get impaled or have the skin

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.810
of their feet licked off by goats.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.840
Yeah. That happened.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.180
Despite this classic remorselessness, lack
of empathy, and sometimes criminal behavior,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:38.919
criminality is not always a component of antisocial
behavior. Certainly many people with criminal

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:44.259
records don't fit that psychopathic profile.
Most show remorse, love, and concern for friends

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:48.710
and family. But still, although anti-social
personalities make up just about 1% of the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:54.039
general population, they were estimated in one study
to constitute about 16% of the incarcerated population.

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.770
So, how might someone end up with such a disturbing
disorder? Well, as you might expect, the causes

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:04.230
are probably a tangled combination of biological and
psychological threads, both genetic and environmental.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.500
Although no one has found a single genetic
predictor of Antisocial Personality Disorder,

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.300
twin and adoption studies do show that relatives
of those with psychopathic features do have

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.610
a higher likelihood of engaging in psychopathic
behavior themselves. And early signs are sometimes

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:22.849
detected as young as age three or four, often
as an impairment in fear conditioning, in

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.949
other words, lower than normal response to
things that typically startle or frighten

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:30.669
children like loud and unpleasant noises.
Most kids only need to get burned by a hot

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.380
dish once to know to stay away, but kids who
end up displaying Antisocial Personalities

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.100
as adults don't necessarily connect or care about
the learned consequences when they're little.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.560
From there, like we've seen in other disorders,
genetic and biological influences can intersect

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:48.080
with an abusive or neglectful environment
to help wire the personality in a peculiar

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.389
and damaged way. While the vast majority of
traumatized people don't grow up to be killers

00:07:52.389 --> 00:07:57.980
or con-artists, genes do seem to predispose some
people to be more sensitive to abuse or trauma.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:01.580
Meanwhile, studies exploring the neural basis
of Antisocial Disorder have revealed that

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.569
when shown evocative photographs, like a child
being hit or a woman with a knife at her throat,

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:11.539
those with psychopathic personality features
showed little change in heart rate and perspiration,

00:08:11.539 --> 00:08:12.830
as compared to control groups.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.919
And the classic antisocial lack of impulse
control and other symptoms have also been

00:08:16.919 --> 00:08:21.050
linked to deficits in certain brain structures.
One study compared PET scans from 41 people

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:25.699
convicted of murder to those of non-criminals
and found that the convicted killers had greatly

00:08:25.699 --> 00:08:30.220
reduced activity in the frontal lobe, an area
associated with impulse control and keeping

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:35.240
aggressive behavior in check. In fact, violent
repeat offenders had as much as 11% less frontal

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:39.330
lobe tissue than the average brain. Their
brains also responded less to facial displays

00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:43.909
of stress or anguish, something that's also
observed in childhood, so it's possible that

00:08:43.909 --> 00:08:48.480
some antisocial personalities lack empathy
because they simply don't or can't register

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.290
others' feelings. Research has also suggested
an overly reactive dopamine reward system,

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:57.269
suggesting that the drive to act on an impulse
to gain stimulation or short-term rewards

00:08:57.269 --> 00:09:01.140
regardless of the consequences may be more
intense than the average person's.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:06.000
As we mentioned before, because personality
disorders are pretty much egosyntonic by definition,

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.480
people don't often acknowledge that they have
a problem or a need for treatment - and in

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.470
the case of Antisocial Personality Disorder,
even if they did, there aren't many specific

00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:16.830
treatments available, at least not for adults.

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:21.260
But there are some promising interventions
for kids and adolescents whose minds and brains

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:25.120
are more plastic and adaptable. In this way,
the best way to treat Antisocial Personality

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.940
Disorder may be in trying to prevent it. According
to American psychiatrist Donald W. Black,

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:35.040
among others, many kids diagnosed with Conduct
Disorder, the diagnostic precursor to Antisocial

00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:39.560
Disorder, are at high-risk for developing
Antisocial Personalities as adults. But by

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.330
identifying warning signs early on and by
working with these kids and families to correct

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.670
their behavior and remove negative influences,
some of that impulse fearlessness could be

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:52.760
channeled into healthier directions, like
to reward promoting athleticism, or a spirit

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:56.170
of adventure. It's important to remember that
Antisocial Personality Disorder is only one

00:09:56.170 --> 00:10:00.769
type of personality disorder. This is a diverse
family of psychological conditions determined

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:06.110
by many different factors and we're still
in the early stages of diagnosing and understanding

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:07.600
the mechanisms behind them.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:11.459
Today, you learned about personality disorders
and the difference between ego-dystonic and

00:10:11.459 --> 00:10:15.490
ego-syntonic disorders. We looked at the three
clusters of personality disorder, according

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:20.380
to the DSM V, and how personality disorder
symptoms often overlap. We also took a look

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.920
at Borderline and Antisocial Personality Disorders,
including their potential bio-psycho-social roots.
