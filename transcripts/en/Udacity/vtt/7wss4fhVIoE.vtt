00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.100
Howdy, Charles.

00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.500
&gt;&gt; Howdy, Howdy.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.640
&gt;&gt; Sure, why not. How's it going?

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.350
&gt;&gt; How do? It's, doing quite well. Thank you for asking.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.840
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.110
&gt;&gt; How's it going on your end of the world?

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.540
&gt;&gt; I'm feeling okay, let's say. Though I'm a little concerned because

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.200
last time we, we were talking and you said you had a question.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.030
And I promised that I would get into it. And it's, it's complicated,

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.850
but it's really interesting. So let's,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.880
let's remind ourselves what the question was.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.510
So, we're talking about bounding the number of samples that

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.300
we need to learn. A classifier or a concept in

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.440
some given hypothesis base, h. and we ended up driving

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.170
a formula that looks like this. So, the formula tells us

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.140
that we're okay, as long as the number of samples

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.252
is at least as large as 1 over the air parameter,

00:00:44.252 --> 00:00:47.040
epsilon ; times the quantity log of the number of

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.660
hypotheses. Plus the log of 1 over the failure parameter. And,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.690
and so if the We want to make sure that we succeed with very

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.080
low failure probabilities. Delta's very small and

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080
that means we need more samples and if

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.120
we want to make sure that this error is really small, that also makes

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.670
this quantity big, which means we need

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.410
more samples. Right, so do you remember this?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.980
&gt;&gt; I do remember this.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.790
&gt;&gt; Alright and what was your concern?

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.580
&gt;&gt; Well my concern was that the number of depended

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.730
on the size of the hypothesis space. And I was

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.460
wondering what happen if you have a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.900
really, really large hypothesis space. Like for

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.630
example, one of infinite size or infinite

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.200
cardinality I suppose is the right term.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.540
&gt;&gt; Alright well let's do a quiz.
