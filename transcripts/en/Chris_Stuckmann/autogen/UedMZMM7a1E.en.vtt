00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.900
afterwards there's some resolution of
stuff but it keeps like dragging on and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910
stuff but it keeps like dragging on and
 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.210
stuff but it keeps like dragging on and
on I felt like if it was just tired and

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220
