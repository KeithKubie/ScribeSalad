00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.700
SPEAKER: I'm really
excited to introduce

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.930
our speaker for today.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.590
His name is Antonio Neves,
who is a nationally recognized

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.040
leadership speaker,
author, and workplace

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.100
consultant to top
organizations and startups.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.020
I actually first
heard of Antonio

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.501
from our Global Head of
Diversity staffing, Daisy.

00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:25.750
And she actually handed me
his book, which some of you

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.550
got today-- "50 Ways to Excel
in Your First Job and in Life."

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.180
I can honestly say I
read it front to back

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.930
and agreed with
Daisy that it was

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.650
crucial to get Antonio in
here today to speak to you all

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.410
and share his nuggets of wisdom.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.300
Just to tell you a bit
more about Antonio,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.660
he has delivered
hundreds of keynotes

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.850
at corporations, conferences,
trade shows, and universities,

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.200
including Starwood Hotels and
Resorts, Stanford University,

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.990
for all of the Stanford folks
here, the American Society

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.100
of Health System Pharmacists,
the Consumer Electronics

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.810
Show, and many more.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.830
An award-winning journalist,
for over 10 years,

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.150
Antonio worked in the
television industry

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.220
in New York City as a
reporter and a correspondent

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.090
with top television networks,
including NBC, PBS, and BET

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.650
networks.

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.270
A Google search
will also tell you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:20.350
that Antonio began his
television career co-hosting

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.680
shows on Children's Television
Network, Nickelodeon.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.420
Antonio's business
writing can be read

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.510
on inc.com entrepreneur.com.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.180
And he's the author
of three books,

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.910
including "50 Ways to Excel in
Your First Job and in Life."

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.470
A graduate of Western
Michigan University,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.350
and earned a Master's
of Science degree

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.250
from Columbia University.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.940
Please provide a warm
welcome to Antonio Neves.

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.900
If I have the opportunity,
I have the pleasure

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.120
of traveling anywhere between
15,000 to 20,000 miles a month,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.170
speaking at trade
associations, at corporations,

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.670
at universities, you name it.

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.930
And I got really
excited when I saw

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.210
that Google in Mountain
View is on the calendar

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.100
because as I mentioned
earlier, Napa Valley is not

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.320
too far from here.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.850
So I remember looking at my
wife home and I was talking.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.230
I was like, you
know, honey, I've

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.500
been working
really, really hard.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.583
I've been traveling a lot.

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:17.230
And I think what
I'm going to do,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.070
after I finish up at Google,
is go to wine country

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.940
for a few days by myself.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.250
I'm going to go taste some wine
and walk through the vineyards

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.860
and relax and get a little
bit of R&amp;R for Antonio.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.570
And my wife, she looked at me.

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.790
And she smiled, gave
this weird look.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.530
And she said, oh, is that so?

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.830
And then she reminded me
that just a couple of months

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.980
ago, she gave birth to
our twins, our daughter

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.284
Harper and our son August.

00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:50.200
So needless to say, after
I've finished today,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.410
I'll be going directly
to the airport.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.020
I won't be going to taste
any wine whatsoever.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.070
Again, it's an honor
to join you here

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.490
to talk about my book, "50
Ways to Excel in Your First Job

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.100
and in Life."

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.280
This is critical to me
because my passion really

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.790
is supporting
young professionals

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.160
in doing exceptional
things in their career,

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.016
making them aware of the
choices that they have in life.

00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:16.640
And the reason why I wrote this
book is because frankly, what I

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.056
share in this book
are things that

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:20.200
have made a big
difference in my life.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.150
And I would not be here
talking to you today

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.440
without some of those key
lessons I share in that book.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.760
You see, as I traveled
across the country, those 15,

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.240
those 20,000 miles
a month, what I

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.100
see are a lot of
young professionals

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.750
and college students
who, on paper, on paper,

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.860
everything looks right.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.450
But as we all know, on paper
only tells part of the story.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.780
Maybe you go to the
right university.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.570
Maybe you have the right
grade point average.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.650
Maybe you're part of
the right organizations.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.700
Maybe you've had the
right internships.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.340
But what I've seen
firsthand are so

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.040
many young professionals
who are kind of

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.510
like a high-powered jet.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.760
They're barreling down
the runway at full speed.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.070
But for some reason,
they can't take off.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.120
They're struggling to
take off in their career.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.060
And the research
actually backs this up.

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:09.980
We can look at some
research from Gallup

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.650
way back in 2015,
last year, that

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.940
said employers are finding that
many college graduates are not

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.570
prepared with the
skills that they need

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.902
to succeed in the workforce.

00:04:20.902 --> 00:04:22.860
Now, the skills they're
talking about something

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:23.850
called soft skills.

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.060
That's about leadership.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.150
That's communication.

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.930
That's collaboration,
emotional intelligence.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.770
They say young professionals
like yourself aren't prepared

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.344
with creative thinking.

00:04:33.344 --> 00:04:35.260
And they say young
professionals like yourself

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.550
aren't ready with good
problem-solving skills.

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.237
Now, on the flipside,
Deloitte did a study.

00:04:42.237 --> 00:04:44.320
And that said that young
professionals and college

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.620
students like
yourselves don't think

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.540
that their skill sets,
their academic education,

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.350
is valued by employers.

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.180
So obviously, we have a divide.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.270
And the stakes are
extremely high, right?

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.670
Because a corporation, when
they hire you to work with them,

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.340
they spend a lot of money
to find you, to develop you,

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.100
to groom you to succeed.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.720
And all of you who are getting
your education right now,

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.960
you've spent a lot of
money on your education,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.700
getting ready to
succeed in your life.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.631
So you want a return
on that investment.

00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.130
So what I hope to
share in this book

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.470
is what can bridge that divide.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:22.900
You know, before
I go any further,

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.490
I think it's really important
to share a little bit more

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.100
about my background so you can
tell where I'm coming from,

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.740
where I share this information.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.694
So if you happen to do
a Google search on me,

00:05:30.694 --> 00:05:33.360
you'll find that I worked in the
television industry in New York

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.140
City for over 10 years as a
reporter, as a correspondent,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.190
as a host with NBC.

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.844
I've interviewed top CEOs,
executives, and entrepreneurs,

00:05:41.844 --> 00:05:43.260
the men and the
women that you see

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.860
on the covers of "Fast
Company" and "Inc. Magazine."

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.660
With PBS, on "The NewsHour"
and the [INAUDIBLE] news,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.190
I've covered serious topics
like international trade,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:55.800
the economy, education,
the Supreme Court.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.300
With "E!

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:00.640
News Live," I've interviewed
popstars like Aaron Carter.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:04.140
With the BET networks, I've
created documentary series.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.550
My writing can be read
in a variety of outlets

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.412
like "Inc. Magazine"
and entrepreneur.com.

00:06:09.412 --> 00:06:12.850
I lead the higher education
team at International Personal

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:15.420
Branding Platform about me.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.000
And a little-known fact
that was mentioned briefly

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.760
in my introduction is that
I began my career co-hosting

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.100
shows on a television network
called Nickelodeon, way

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.050
back in 2002 to 2004 or 2005.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.980
If you're confused, I'm
the handsome brother

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.010
in the corner with
the dreadlocks.

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.140
This was a long time ago
when I began my career.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.515
So if you've ever
asked yourself,

00:06:37.515 --> 00:06:40.770
you know, I wonder whatever
happens to former Nickelodeon

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.670
hosts.

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:42.170
What's up?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.336
How's everybody doing today?

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:45.460
Good to see you.

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.650
Now, look, I don't
show these credentials,

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.490
I don't show these
networks to you

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.610
and all this fun stuff to
brag or to boast, by no means.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.020
Because these are my credits,
my Google search today.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.980
But 15 years ago, if you
did that exact same search,

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.960
this is what you would find.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.141
You wouldn't find anything.

00:07:07.141 --> 00:07:08.640
Maybe for many of
you, this is where

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.610
you are right now
as you are beginning

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.010
your career, this blank
slate, this blank canvas.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.165
You see, I'm from a
small town in Michigan.

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:18.540
I'm from one of
those small towns

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:22.120
where people do not leave.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.530
I am from a family
that experienced

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.590
a lot of instability.

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.300
Before I graduated from high
school, I moved over 15 times,

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.180
over 15 times in
my small hometown.

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:40.261
Between my mother and father are
a total of like six divorces.

00:07:40.261 --> 00:07:41.760
I also know what
it's like firsthand

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.745
to live in a
shelter for battered

00:07:43.745 --> 00:07:46.640
and abused women and children.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.330
I'm a first generation
college student,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.150
the first person my
family to go to college

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:53.600
and be able to earn a degree.

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600
Now, I don't share
any of this with you

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.841
to elicit any
sympathy, by no means.

00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:02.090
I only know if I had to share
with you, for many years

00:08:02.090 --> 00:08:06.530
I was ashamed of it, and
I was embarrassed by it.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:09.440
But oddly enough, I found
that those things right there

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.310
are many of the reasons why I'm
standing here with you today.

00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:14.960
It built up a certain amount
of grit that a lot of people

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.041
are talking about today.

00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:18.040
There's a great book out
right now called "Grit"

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.890
by Angela Duckworth.

00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:22.460
Let's build up that grit, that
perseverance, that resilience,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.456
that character to move forward
through challenging times.

00:08:25.456 --> 00:08:27.330
Now, many of you, there's
something about you

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.621
that's unique that someone would
never find in a Google search.

00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:33.120
And I want you to
know that whatever

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.130
that is that people
may not know right now,

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.860
use that to your advantage,
not your disadvantage.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.434
Own that, as opposed
to hide that.

00:08:42.434 --> 00:08:44.090
And you have a blank
canvas right now.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.950
As you begin this summer
and you begin your career,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.491
you have a blank
canvas, if you will,

00:08:47.491 --> 00:08:49.460
to paint and to create
and to scope what

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:51.432
you most want in your life.

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:53.140
And I believe the
three things that we'll

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.681
get into today that will allow
you to do that are these three

00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.420
topics right here, that is being
willing to turn up the volume,

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.990
being willing to find the
edge, and being willing to do

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.540
something that seems obvious.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.270
But for some reason, not a lot
of people do that, that is,

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:11.679
find people who make you better.

00:09:11.679 --> 00:09:13.220
And if there's a
thesis of everything

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.030
that I do of my work,
it's this right here.

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:20.100
That is, being willing to
be the CEO of your career.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.350
I've had the opportunity over
my life to interview and profile

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.120
extremely talented
CEOs, entrepreneurs,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.544
you name it, who've built
billion-dollar companies.

00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:30.960
And one thing I've noticed in
these men and women is this,

00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.830
is that they take
full accountability

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.970
and responsibility
for their experience.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.690
They're willing
to have an agenda.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.170
They're willing to have goals.

00:09:40.170 --> 00:09:43.752
They're willing to be
proactive versus reactive.

00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:46.210
A lot of employees come and
they wait for things to happen.

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:48.460
I'm inviting all of you over
the course of this summer

00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:51.900
to be proactive and
make things happen.

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.980
Yes, Google's going to do
amazing things for you.

00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.580
The question begs, what
can you do for yourself

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.842
during this time
that you are here?

00:09:59.842 --> 00:10:02.990
So let's get into this
with turning up the volume.

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.030
Many years ago, I
started my career.

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:08.260
I worked briefly as a local
news reporter for a really small

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:09.096
television station.

00:10:09.096 --> 00:10:12.260
Now, I remember walking into
my news station one day.

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:14.690
And my news director
happened to be sitting there.

00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:17.580
And he was looking at a
reels that reporters had sent

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.562
in from all across the country.

00:10:19.562 --> 00:10:21.020
These are men and
women that wanted

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.228
to work for the television
station that I worked for.

00:10:23.228 --> 00:10:25.550
They wanted to replace me.

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:26.590
So he saw me.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:30.002
And he called me into the office
to watch these reels with him.

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.210
And after a few moments of
watching some of the reels

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.110
with him, I had to
ask him to stop.

00:10:35.110 --> 00:10:36.947
And we pushed pause.

00:10:36.947 --> 00:10:39.280
Because what I noticed, as
we were watching these reels,

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:43.270
was that the volume was
turned down on the television.

00:10:43.270 --> 00:10:45.730
Now, as we all know,
television it's an audio,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.950
it's a visual medium.

00:10:47.950 --> 00:10:50.920
So I said, boss, how can
you hire this young man

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.640
or hire this young
woman if you can't

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.760
hear what they are saying.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:55.550
He looked at me.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.690
He smiled.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:11:00.220
It was as if he had been
anticipating this question.

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.780
And he said, Antonio,
I want to see if I

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.525
want to turn the volume up.

00:11:07.525 --> 00:11:11.222
I want to see if I want
to turn the volume up.

00:11:11.222 --> 00:11:13.430
Think about those moments
in life you've been at home

00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:15.600
and five million different
things are going on.

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.805
The radio is blasting.

00:11:16.805 --> 00:11:17.860
You're on social media.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.490
You're cooking.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.210
You're doing dishes.

00:11:19.210 --> 00:11:20.418
You're having a conversation.

00:11:20.418 --> 00:11:22.100
But something happens
to be happening

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:24.680
on the television that
grabs your attention

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:27.900
and you have to find that remote
control to turn up the volume

00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:29.620
to see what's being said.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.860
Or maybe you've been at
a party or a gathering.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.800
And you're having a conversation
with her right here.

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:36.800
And she's cool, right?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:37.300
Right?

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:38.310
We're having a
good conversation.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.980
OK.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.560
But at some point during
that party, that gathering,

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.790
you notice another conversation
happening over here

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:46.490
that you want to turn
the volume up on.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:47.740
Like, hey, I'll see you later.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.600
Deuces.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.730
Well, believe it or
not, every single day

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:53.563
over the course of your
life-- and they say,

00:11:53.563 --> 00:11:55.030
don't judge a book by its cover.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.900
But let's be real.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.220
Keep it 100, as they say.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.309
People do.

00:12:00.309 --> 00:12:01.850
People are determining
whether or not

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.450
they want to turn
the volume up on you

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:07.330
or press mute in your career.

00:12:07.330 --> 00:12:11.730
They are doing that based
on what time you show up.

00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:16.100
They are doing that based
on how you present yourself.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:20.042
They are doing that based on
your body language and energy.

00:12:20.042 --> 00:12:21.500
They are determining
whether or not

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.620
they want to turn the
volume up on you based

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:27.835
on what shows up with you
when you come into a room.

00:12:27.835 --> 00:12:29.210
Have you ever been
to a gathering

00:12:29.210 --> 00:12:32.870
or a party and the door opens
and you look over and it's Tim?

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.390
And you're like oh, Tim.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:38.550
And you know the party
is about to get worse?

00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:41.890
You know that person that makes
the party-- you're like, oh.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.160
And there have been other times,
you're at this same party.

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.260
You hear the door open.

00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:47.152
You look.

00:12:47.152 --> 00:12:47.860
And it's Deborah.

00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:50.050
And you're like,
oh, Deborah's here.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.890
And you know the party's
about to get better.

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:56.820
Do people want to turn
the volume up on you

00:12:56.820 --> 00:12:59.240
or turn it down and press mute?

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.480
In this day and age, we hear
a lot about personal brand

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:05.920
and how important it is for you
to develop your personal brand.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.710
Well, the best
definition that I've

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:10.360
heard that relates to
personal branding is this.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:13.900
Your personal brand is
what people say about you

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.180
when you are not around.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:18.620
That's a simple way to put it.

00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:20.790
I don't care if it's
online or in person.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.390
Your personal brand is
what people say about you

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:24.960
when you are not around.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:28.520
What I invite all of you to
do after you leave here today

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.500
is open up a Google
Chrome browser,

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.550
and then open up
a private window,

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:39.690
and then Google your name and
see what those results are.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:40.680
Because guess what?

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:42.140
You're not around when
somebody does that.

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:42.848
You meet someone.

00:13:42.848 --> 00:13:43.900
What do you do?

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.740
You Google their name.

00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:47.940
It's so funny when I do
this exercise with people.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.250
They'll go to that
private browser.

00:13:49.250 --> 00:13:51.250
Don't go to a regular
browser because you Google

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.930
yourself all the time anyways.

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:54.260
But go to the private browser.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.968
Google your name.

00:13:54.968 --> 00:13:59.530
And I see people do things
like, that's not me.

00:13:59.530 --> 00:14:01.560
Other people look
at that and say,

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.080
that's not a
flattering photo of me.

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.630
People look at
that and say, yeah,

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:09.180
that last Instagram post isn't
really what I'm all about.

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.120
But it is me.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.120
Your personal brand is
what people say about you

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.790
when you're not around.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:19.030
Now, to continue on this theme
of turning up the volume,

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.330
do we have any country
music fans in the room?

00:14:21.330 --> 00:14:23.360
Raise your hand.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.030
Six people.

00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.140
OK, well, we'll talk
about hip-hop instead.

00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:28.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:29.430
I'm a big hip-hop fan.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:34.680
And way back in 2001, I went to
a rap concert in New York City,

00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:36.039
in Irving Plaza.

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.830
I went to go see one
of my favorite artists

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:40.740
at the time, this guy by
the name of Talib Kweli.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:43.160
And he is still one of
my favorite artists.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.750
I remember getting
to the venue early,

00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:46.290
right when the doors opened.

00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:48.200
And as I was walking
in, I heard someone

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.300
say from the loudspeakers,
ladies and gentlemen,

00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:53.200
it's time for our opening act.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.617
You don't know who
this person is.

00:14:54.617 --> 00:14:56.158
You probably haven't
heard the music.

00:14:56.158 --> 00:14:57.490
But they're extremely talented.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:14:59.780
Please give your love,
please give your attention,

00:14:59.780 --> 00:15:02.490
please give your energy
to our opening act.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:06.170
And this opening act came
out and started performing.

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.620
Now, I invite all of you
to think about those times

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.610
that you've been to a concert
and the opening act comes out

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:13.790
and you are not
familiar with them,

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:16.350
and you are not familiar
with their music.

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:18.066
What do you do?

00:15:18.066 --> 00:15:21.260
Well, people I know, typically,
they'll pull out their phone.

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:22.700
They'll have a conversation.

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.910
They'll grab some beverages.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.690
They'll do anything
but pay attention

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.307
to the person on stage.

00:15:27.307 --> 00:15:28.890
It's not because
they're not talented.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:30.389
It's not because
they're not gifted.

00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:32.320
It's just that they
don't have any context.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.520
And look, in 2001,
there was no SoundCloud.

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.810
So you weren't researching
this in advance.

00:15:37.810 --> 00:15:40.880
But interestingly enough,
after that opening act started

00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:45.350
performing, they made me and
a few others in that venue

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:48.794
want to turn the volume up.

00:15:48.794 --> 00:15:51.210
And the reason why they made
me want to turn the volume up

00:15:51.210 --> 00:15:54.290
is because, even though pretty
much no one-- and I mean

00:15:54.290 --> 00:15:56.440
no one-- was paying
attention to them,

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:00.610
they still were giving
absolutely everything.

00:16:00.610 --> 00:16:02.150
It was as if this
opening act was

00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:05.222
performing to a sold-out
arena, while no one was

00:16:05.222 --> 00:16:05.930
paying attention.

00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:08.240
It was as if the
pope this opening act

00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.490
was a multi-platinum Grammy
Award winning artist.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:16.650
It was as if this opening
act was already performing

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:18.500
at the MTV Music Awards.

00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:21.180
While no one was
paying attention,

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.706
they were giving
absolutely everything.

00:16:25.706 --> 00:16:27.580
The question I have for
everyone in this room

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.244
is, what do you do when no
one is paying attention?

00:16:31.244 --> 00:16:33.410
Think about those times
you've been in the classroom

00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:35.201
or you've been involved
in a group project,

00:16:35.201 --> 00:16:38.280
and you know there is that one
person, because there's always

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.860
that one person that will do
all the work in that group.

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.450
You know that person?

00:16:43.450 --> 00:16:47.110
Do you let them do all the
work just because they will?

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:49.110
Or maybe you've been
really committed to getting

00:16:49.110 --> 00:16:51.930
in better shape when you meet a
friend of yours a couple times

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:54.990
a week at 6:00 AM
to go to the gym.

00:16:54.990 --> 00:16:57.740
But the night before, you
get a text message that says,

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.310
dude, not going to
be able to make it.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:03.700
Do you still go to the gym
even though that person is not

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.540
going to be there?

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:09.210
Or maybe even really cognizant
of focusing on your health

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.520
and wellness and not
eating processed foods,

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.450
but it's late night.

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:13.119
You're tired.

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:15.077
The last thing you want
to do when you get home

00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:15.950
is cook something.

00:17:15.950 --> 00:17:19.359
And you happen to pass by
a fast food restaurant.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.040
Do you still pull in
when no one is watching?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.180
What do you do when
no one pays attention?

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:25.569
I'm a firm believer
that what you

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:27.460
do when no one is
paying attention

00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:30.720
will deliver the results
you do or do not want.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.780
Well, getting back to that
concert way back in 2001,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:36.560
that person on stage
really impressed me.

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:38.390
But time came and went.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:42.732
But I remember in 2004,
three years later-- 2004,

00:17:42.732 --> 00:17:44.690
three years later, I
remember hearing some buzz

00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:47.480
about some new
artist on the scene.

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:49.640
Some new album was
dropped the everyone was

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.790
raving about and talking about.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:54.480
So I keep all the ticket
stubs for the concerts

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.220
and the sporting
events that I go to.

00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:58.390
And I went and grabbed
that ticket stub

00:17:58.390 --> 00:18:01.010
and I cross-referenced
it with that album

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:02.670
and all those articles.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:04.660
And I found out
that that person who

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:09.140
was giving absolutely everything
when no one was watching

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:16.204
three years earlier was someone
by the name of Kanye West.

00:18:16.204 --> 00:18:18.370
Now, it goes without saying
that Kanye West believes

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:19.292
in Kanye West.

00:18:19.292 --> 00:18:20.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:20.650 --> 00:18:23.010
Is that fair to say?

00:18:23.010 --> 00:18:25.150
The question is if
Kanye West did not

00:18:25.150 --> 00:18:29.180
believe in Kanye West three
years earlier, who would have?

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.730
People give this man a lot of
ridicule and a lot of flack

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:34.380
for his social media
rants and if you

00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:37.320
want to call them,
diatribes and his opinions.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.930
But I don't look at
this man the same way

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:44.160
because for three years,
before anyone knew his name,

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:46.502
he was giving absolutely
everything while no one was

00:18:46.502 --> 00:18:47.210
paying attention.

00:18:47.210 --> 00:18:48.990
In many ways, I feel
like he's earned it.

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:52.419
He can say whatever
he wants to say.

00:18:52.419 --> 00:18:54.960
His success didn't come three
months later, six months later,

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.320
one year later, two years later.

00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:59.616
No, three years later,
the album came out.

00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:00.990
While no one was
watching, he was

00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:02.210
giving absolutely everything.

00:19:02.210 --> 00:19:06.657
What do you do when
no one is watching?

00:19:06.657 --> 00:19:08.740
What this gets across for
me this whole notion of,

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:11.770
you don't climb a
mountain by accident

00:19:11.770 --> 00:19:13.910
over the course of your career.

00:19:13.910 --> 00:19:15.851
I talk to a lot of
young professionals.

00:19:15.851 --> 00:19:17.850
And I do a lot of consulting
with organizations.

00:19:17.850 --> 00:19:19.920
And a similar refrain
is that people

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.560
want more responsibility.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:23.070
They want the bigger projects.

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.010
They want the bigger
titles, you name it.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.330
But you don't climb a
mountain by accident.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.470
If somehow, I could
miraculously airlift you

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:34.210
to the top of Mount Kilimanjaro
or to the top of, let's say,

00:19:34.210 --> 00:19:37.120
Mount Everest, which is
nearly 30,000 feet altitude,

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:39.850
what would happen
when you got out?

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:42.190
You would take in
this amazing view.

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:45.560
And you would probably
pass out afterwards.

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.960
And the reason why
is because your lungs

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:51.960
have not earned being
at that altitude.

00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.290
You have not done the work
when no one is watching.

00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:57.140
It's no wonder when we think
about reality television--

00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.540
I enjoy the reality television
competitions like anyone else.

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:03.530
But there's no wonder that
one or two years after someone

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:05.790
wins that television
competition,

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:09.906
we no longer hear that
man or woman's name.

00:20:09.906 --> 00:20:11.780
It's not because, again,
they're not talented

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:13.010
or they're not gifted.

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.430
It's because they
haven't done the work

00:20:15.430 --> 00:20:16.940
when no one was watching.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.190
It was handed to
them prematurely.

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.030
Has anyone in this room ever--
has anybody here ever driven

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:24.330
a stick-shift before?

00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.140
OK, what happens
if you try to start

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.574
a stick-shift in fifth gear?

00:20:29.574 --> 00:20:30.490
You're going to stall.

00:20:30.490 --> 00:20:32.679
Yeah, you're not going
to have a lot of luck.

00:20:32.679 --> 00:20:34.720
What I see happening with
people in their careers

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.530
is they're trying to get
to fifth gear right away.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.070
The opportunity
that all of us have

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:43.790
is to be willing to earn first
gear, to earn second gear,

00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.960
to earn third year, and
even learn to enjoy those

00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:52.504
stalls because that right there
is where the magic happens.

00:20:52.504 --> 00:20:54.670
What I want to get across
to you is this right here,

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.220
that ideas are useless.

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:01.270
Ideas are useless until you
breathe some type of life

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.960
into them.

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:04.740
Right now, on some
of your hard drives

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.940
are some of the best ideas
ever that you have never

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.525
taken action on.

00:21:09.525 --> 00:21:11.400
Right now, somewhere in
one of your notebooks

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.940
that's packed away
in a file cabinet,

00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.356
or maybe in your notebook right
in front of you right now,

00:21:15.356 --> 00:21:17.440
are amazing ideas
that for some reason,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:19.406
you have yet to take action on.

00:21:19.406 --> 00:21:20.780
Right now, some
of the best ideas

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.150
are happening over brunch
conversations with mimosas.

00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.780
But after that second
mimosa, the idea

00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:27.660
goes out of the window.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.670
Ideas are useless unless
you breathe life into them.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:32.170
When I started off
in Nickelodeon,

00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.170
I didn't start off
as a television host.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:38.830
I actually started off working
on a show as a production

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.572
assistant.

00:21:39.572 --> 00:21:41.780
Now, if you know anything
about working in television

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.363
and working as a
production assistant,

00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:46.530
you know that it is not a sexy--
it is not a glamorous job.

00:21:46.530 --> 00:21:47.490
You're making coffee.

00:21:47.490 --> 00:21:48.610
You're making photocopies.

00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:50.040
You're holding cue cards.

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.330
You're carrying
equipment around.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:55.160
But one of my goals
was to be a writer.

00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.700
So after all my responsibilities
were complete, I would write.

00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.200
I took writing classes.

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.990
I studied great writers.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.990
And slowly but surely,
my writing improved.

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.990
And after a while, I
built up enough confidence

00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:09.230
to go to the head writer
of the television show

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.800
that I worked on to ask him
if he'd be willing to give me

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.750
feedback on my scripts.

00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:15.906
And he said absolutely.

00:22:15.906 --> 00:22:17.280
And I learned
another key lesson.

00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:23.150
That is nine times out of 10,
people are willing to help you.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:27.080
But it is your responsibility
to ask for that help.

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.580
Over the course of
the summer, there

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:30.950
are amazing people
on this Google campus

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:32.430
and throughout the organization.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:34.207
They are willing to help you.

00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:36.040
But again, you have
them take accountability

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:38.560
and responsibility
and be willing to ask

00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.280
for that support, to
ask for that 15 minutes,

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.225
ask for that guidance.

00:22:43.225 --> 00:22:45.100
So after a while, I
started giving my scripts

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:46.090
to the head writer on the show.

00:22:46.090 --> 00:22:48.010
And slowly but surely, they
got a little bit better.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:48.843
Then they got worse.

00:22:48.843 --> 00:22:50.920
And then they got better.

00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.180
But I'll never forget, one day
the head writer came up to me

00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.960
in my cubicle.

00:22:55.960 --> 00:23:00.754
And he said, Antonio, one of
our writers is out sick today.

00:23:00.754 --> 00:23:02.670
Do you happen to have
any scripts ready to go?

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.686
I had a lot of
scripts ready to go.

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.280
I handed it to him.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.370
That day, one of
my scripts appeared

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.210
on the television show.

00:23:13.210 --> 00:23:16.410
A few weeks later, I began
regularly contributing

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:17.410
to that television show.

00:23:17.410 --> 00:23:19.922
And I eventually
became a staff writer.

00:23:19.922 --> 00:23:21.130
And I learned a great lesson.

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.250
That is, all it takes is
someone being out sick

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:28.780
one day for your opportunity
to present itself.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.860
The question begs,
will you be ready

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:33.734
when that opportunity comes?

00:23:33.734 --> 00:23:35.400
Because I've seen
that opportunity come.

00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:37.070
Someone is out sick.

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.930
Someone goes on vacation.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:43.700
Someone leaves to go to another
company and that slot opens up

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:44.810
and people step into it.

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:47.435
But unfortunately, because they
haven't done the requisite work

00:23:47.435 --> 00:23:51.570
when no one is watching, they
struggle in that situation.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:55.200
If you're an NFL football
fan, a lot of people

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:58.670
talk about quarterback Tom Brady
who's won multiple Super Bowls.

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:01.280
What a lot of people don't
know is that that starting job

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.020
was not Tom Brady's initially.

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:06.560
Tom Brady was a sixth
round draft pick.

00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.990
But there was
another quarterback

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:13.260
by the name of Drew Bledsoe who
got injured in a football game.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:14.660
Tom Brady came in for him.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:17.130
And the rest is history.

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:19.510
And the reason why he was
able to excel and succeed

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.800
is because he did the work
when no one is watching.

00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:26.742
And what I hear a lot when
I talk about doing the work,

00:24:26.742 --> 00:24:27.700
I hear a lot of things.

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.797
You know, I'm just
going to wing it.

00:24:29.797 --> 00:24:30.880
I'm just going to wing it.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.160
I'm good on my feet.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:34.890
Don't wing it.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:38.180
I can tell you this right
here is that winging is easy

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.240
when you're well prepared.

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:47.440
It's easy to go off script
when you know the script.

00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:52.940
It's easy to break the rules
when you know the rules.

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.350
It's easy to get off
of an exit on a highway

00:24:55.350 --> 00:24:57.530
when you know how to get
back on and know eventually

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.110
where you're going.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.572
Be willing to do the work
when no one is watching.

00:25:01.572 --> 00:25:03.280
And after you've been
willing to do that,

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.650
I invite you to
regularly find the edge

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:10.517
over the course of your
life and in your career.

00:25:10.517 --> 00:25:13.100
Do we have any former athletes
in this room, current athletes,

00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.439
former athletes?

00:25:14.439 --> 00:25:16.230
I don't care if you
did this in high school

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.021
or you do this in a
rec leagues intramural.

00:25:18.021 --> 00:25:20.317
But you know those moments
before the whistle goes off

00:25:20.317 --> 00:25:22.650
or the gun goes off in that
football game, that baseball

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:24.920
game, that track race,
volleyball, lacrosse,

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.760
you name it, and
all of a sudden you

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.110
get that increased heart rate
and you get those butterflies?

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:35.640
That right there tells you
that you are finding the edge.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.350
And do we have any
performers in the room?

00:25:38.350 --> 00:25:39.340
Maybe you act.

00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:40.760
Maybe you dance.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.370
Maybe you debate.

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:44.890
Maybe you give public talks
like this one right here.

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:46.810
But in some capacity--
you do open mic night--

00:25:46.810 --> 00:25:48.616
but you have to get
in front of people.

00:25:48.616 --> 00:25:50.740
And you know before they
call your name as your cue

00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740
to come on, and all of
a sudden your throat

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:57.080
gets really constricted and
your hands start trembling?

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:03.200
That right there tells you
that you are finding the edge.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:09.212
And has anyone in this room ever
had a crush on someone before?

00:26:09.212 --> 00:26:10.360
A lot of laughter.

00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:12.950
One hand went up though.

00:26:12.950 --> 00:26:13.660
OK, two hands.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.400
Thank you, sir.

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:16.777
I have a copy of my
book for you afterwards.

00:26:16.777 --> 00:26:18.360
But you know when
you've been crushing

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.432
on someone all semester?

00:26:20.432 --> 00:26:22.015
And all of a sudden
this person you've

00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:24.680
been crushing on all
semester shows up,

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.630
and she just happens
to be in the third row?

00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:31.910
She has glasses on, a t-shirt.

00:26:31.910 --> 00:26:33.306
Her hair is pulled back.

00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:34.930
She's starting to
blush now because she

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.892
realizing that the guy on
stage is talking about her.

00:26:38.892 --> 00:26:39.850
You're crushing on her.

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:41.110
You gotta make a
decision that one day

00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:42.830
when she shows up in front of
you, what are you going to do?

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:44.460
I've been crushing
on her all semester?

00:26:44.460 --> 00:26:46.490
You check your breath.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:49.731
You say, what's up, girl?

00:26:49.731 --> 00:26:50.230
Forgive me.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:51.410
Thank you for playing along.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:55.600
But that feeling right
there is finding the edge.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.440
I invite all of you to
think about the last week

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.000
of your life.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.606
Think about yesterday.

00:27:01.606 --> 00:27:03.230
And I'm a firm believer
if you have not

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.770
felt that, you are not
growing and you are not

00:27:05.770 --> 00:27:08.440
moving forward in your life.

00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.980
As someone told me
a long time ago,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.470
if you are not close
enough to the edge,

00:27:13.470 --> 00:27:16.670
then you are taking
up too much space.

00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:18.220
I believe that
with my everything.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.330
If you are not close
enough to the edge,

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:22.160
then you are taking
up too much space.

00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.810
What we're really talking
about is the unique combination

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:27.224
of fear and excitement.

00:27:27.224 --> 00:27:29.890
Many psychologists will tell you
that fear and excitement pretty

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:32.890
much are the exact same emotion.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:35.180
Fritz Perls, the father
of Gestalt Therapy, once

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:40.810
said that "Fear is excitement
without the breath."

00:27:40.810 --> 00:27:42.630
"Fear is excitement
without the breath."

00:27:42.630 --> 00:27:47.070
Think about professional sports,
if they say someone chokes,

00:27:47.070 --> 00:27:47.570
right?

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.944
And it's the end
of the game they

00:27:48.944 --> 00:27:50.500
miss that easy
lay-up or they double

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:51.900
fault in the tennis match.

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.450
Typically, they say
that person was tight.

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:55.112
They choked.

00:27:55.112 --> 00:27:56.570
If you're tight
and you're choking,

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.230
that means you're not breathing.

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:00.150
You're operating
from a place of fear.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:01.650
But when you think
about when things

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.983
are going great in someone's
life, specifically athletes

00:28:03.983 --> 00:28:05.780
or that talk just
goes extremely well,

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:09.850
they say you are in the
zone or you are in flow.

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:11.114
You are breathing.

00:28:11.114 --> 00:28:12.530
The beautiful thing
is that we all

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:16.569
have that opportunity to choose
between fear and excitement.

00:28:16.569 --> 00:28:18.110
I can think back to
a time in my life

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:19.380
when I had to do exactly that.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:22.970
This is way back
in 2002 or 2003.

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.760
This is in Times
Square, 1515 Broadway.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.090
This is the building where
people, thousands of people,

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.600
came all across the country,
all across the world,

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.060
to look up into
these glass walls

00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:37.820
into a studio to watch tapings
of MTV's "Total Request Live."

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.830
Well, just a few floors
up is where we recorded

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:42.157
Nickelodeon's "U-Pick Live."

00:28:42.157 --> 00:28:44.240
And I remember one day
that the main host was out.

00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.482
And me and someone else were
given the main hosting duties.

00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:48.440
Now, I'm in the studio.

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.420
And there's an x on the
floor where I stand.

00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:52.470
And in front of me are
these three cameras

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.470
with these big, bright
lights on me like this.

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:58.170
Behind the cameras
are people walking,

00:28:58.170 --> 00:28:59.560
getting ready for the show.

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.360
There are kids and
their parents who

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:03.250
had traveled from all
across the country

00:29:03.250 --> 00:29:05.057
to join us for this taping.

00:29:05.057 --> 00:29:06.890
And I hear the director
say from the control

00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:10.390
room on a loudspeaker, we're
going live in 30 seconds.

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:12.392
In 30 seconds we're going live.

00:29:12.392 --> 00:29:15.830
I remember sitting there
saying, wow, in 30 seconds,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:18.210
we're going to be
broadcasting live

00:29:18.210 --> 00:29:21.330
to millions of people
all across the country,

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:22.465
and as a bonus, Canada.

00:29:22.465 --> 00:29:23.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.830
Canada really tripped me
out because I was like,

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:26.880
what happens in Canada?

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:27.685
I had no idea.

00:29:27.685 --> 00:29:31.020
So I'm sitting there like, wow,
millions of people, my family,

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.310
my friends are watching,
millions of people

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:34.730
all across the country.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:36.760
Canada, the kid has come so far.

00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:39.290
Wow, Canada.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:40.987
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:40.987 --> 00:29:42.820
And then slowly but
surely, I was like, wow,

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:43.970
millions of people.

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.300
That's a lot of people.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.080
I was like, one,
two-- I realized

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.470
I wouldn't be able to
count to a million in time.

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:51.676
I was like, Canada, that's
this unknown factor.

00:29:51.676 --> 00:29:52.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:52.752 --> 00:29:54.460
And all of a sudden,
I shifted from being

00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:56.800
really excited to like,
yo, millions of people,

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.719
to millions of people.
that's a lot of people.

00:29:58.719 --> 00:29:59.510
My mom is watching.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.855
My grandma's watching.

00:30:00.855 --> 00:30:04.190
And as I shifted, all of a
sudden, the stage manager said,

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:09.440
Antonio, we're going
live in 5, 4, 3, 2.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.130
And he points at me.

00:30:11.130 --> 00:30:13.770
And the red light
comes on the camera.

00:30:13.770 --> 00:30:16.220
The red light means we
are now broadcasting live

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:20.240
to millions of people all across
the country, and as a bonus--

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.560
AUDIENCE: Canada.

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.910
ANTONIO NEVES: Right.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:28.100
That right there is my moment to
welcome people to today's show

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:29.610
in the camera.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.090
But instead of doing
that, I did this.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.090
I--

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.395
[GRUNTS]

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.510
I froze.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:41.270
I was a deer in headlights.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:45.260
Some people would say I choked.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:50.190
This was my moment, my
moment that I had dreamed of.

00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:52.580
I'm on live TV.

00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:55.310
And I froze.

00:30:55.310 --> 00:30:58.110
And what's wild
about this moment was

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:02.855
all I could think about, all I
could think about was cheese.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.850
All I could think
about was cheese.

00:31:08.850 --> 00:31:10.482
Don't judge me.

00:31:10.482 --> 00:31:12.690
And the reason why all I
could think about was cheese

00:31:12.690 --> 00:31:14.106
was about three
years earlier when

00:31:14.106 --> 00:31:17.480
I graduated from Western
Michigan University,

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:20.050
even though I had aspirations
of working in the entertainment

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:22.480
industry, I didn't do that.

00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:23.220
I got afraid.

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.262
And I took a safe job as a sales
representative selling cheese.

00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:29.970
Now, look, you heard
about my background.

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:31.520
I didn't have the
highest aspirations

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:32.870
for myself growing up.

00:31:32.870 --> 00:31:35.320
But I can guarantee you, when
someone came up to me when

00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.090
I was a kid and
they said, Antonio,

00:31:37.090 --> 00:31:38.631
what you want to be
when you grow up,

00:31:38.631 --> 00:31:41.167
I never said I wanted
to sell cheese.

00:31:41.167 --> 00:31:42.750
I remember going
home for the holidays

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:44.166
when I had this
job selling cheese

00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:45.831
and I would see
friends at the mall who

00:31:45.831 --> 00:31:47.955
chose not to go to college,
and some are unemployed

00:31:47.955 --> 00:31:49.140
and not doing so great.

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.680
And they're like, oh, Antonio
Neves, college graduate.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.210
How are you?

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.460
What are you up to these days?

00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.120
And I would say,
I'm selling cheese.

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.370
And they would say, I'm sorry.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.112
Is everything OK?

00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:00.070
Do you need some money?

00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:05.450
I'm like, I have a job,
company car, benefits, 401(k).

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:08.020
I was selling cheese.

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.980
And I really despised this job.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.530
And the wild thing about
selling cheese was this.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.460
I was a beast at selling cheese.

00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:19.080
My cheese game
was so ridiculous.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.510
Seriously, you have no idea--
gruyere, cheddar, Jack,

00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:23.070
manchego, mozzarella, brie.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:25.084
Somebody give me one.

00:32:25.084 --> 00:32:25.750
AUDIENCE: Gouda.

00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.490
ANTONIO NEVES: Gouda, somebody
got fancy in the back.

00:32:28.490 --> 00:32:31.140
My cheese game was ridiculous.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:33.330
I was exceptional at this,
which really confused me

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:36.000
because I didn't like my job.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.027
But I was good at it.

00:32:38.027 --> 00:32:39.610
Another one of those
ding, ding, ding,

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:40.735
moments came up in my life.

00:32:40.735 --> 00:32:42.210
And that was this.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:44.970
Just because you're
good at something

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:48.380
doesn't mean that you're
supposed to be doing it.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:50.982
I hope that many of you never
encounter this in your life.

00:32:50.982 --> 00:32:52.190
But odds are, you maybe will.

00:32:52.190 --> 00:32:53.700
Just because you're
good at something

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.440
doesn't mean you're
supposed to be doing it.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.000
I speak to a lot of
university students.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.720
And I'll ask questions like,
so what are you majoring in?

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.900
And I'll get an answer like, oh,
integrated supply management.

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.912
I'm like, cool, great.

00:33:02.912 --> 00:33:04.620
How long have you been
into that subject?

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:07.530
They're like, I'm
not really into it.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:09.700
So why are you majoring in this?

00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:11.680
Some magazine said the
year that I graduate,

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.180
there'll be jobs available.

00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:16.560
It's no wonder when you
look at the studies that

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:20.390
say that workplace engagement,
people who are actively engaged

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.140
in their jobs in the United
States, is less than 1/3

00:33:23.140 --> 00:33:25.239
of the working population.

00:33:25.239 --> 00:33:26.780
It's no wonder that
people leave jobs

00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.449
on average in less
than 24 months.

00:33:30.449 --> 00:33:32.740
Because we're choosing things
that we don't want to do.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:34.640
Just because you're
good at something

00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:37.340
doesn't mean you're
supposed to be doing it.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:38.370
And I hung in there.

00:33:38.370 --> 00:33:40.350
I sold cheese for almost a year.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:42.509
But I felt this metaphorical
tap on my shoulder

00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:44.300
that whole year saying,
this is a good job,

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.970
but it's not your job.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:46.990
I felt guilty.

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.540
On Sunday nights, I would
get sick to my stomach

00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:52.110
knowing I had to go
to work the next day.

00:33:52.110 --> 00:33:54.280
So I decided to make
a decision, to lean

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.180
in to a little bit of
fear and excitement.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.305
And I did the scariest
thing I ever did in my life.

00:33:58.305 --> 00:34:02.090
And I moved to New York City
with $700 in my bank account.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:02.930
$700.

00:34:02.930 --> 00:34:04.370
I knew just one person.

00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:07.090
This is pre-Facebook, Twitter,
LinkedIn, Snapchat, Yik

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:09.260
Yak, you name it.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.969
That one person I knew
it was kind enough

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.870
to give me a floor to
sleep on, on three couch

00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:15.830
cushions for a few months.

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:18.170
I slept on three couch
cushions on a floor, not

00:34:18.170 --> 00:34:20.000
a couch, three couch cushions.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.290
That's a big difference
when it comes to neck pain.

00:34:23.290 --> 00:34:25.710
And when you have
$700 in New York City,

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.420
that doesn't go really far.

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:29.880
I have friends today that
pay $700 a month just

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.250
to park their car.

00:34:32.250 --> 00:34:33.739
So I had to get to work.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:38.239
And I remember working temp
jobs from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM.

00:34:38.239 --> 00:34:39.830
And then I would
work a retail job

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:43.996
at a store called H&amp;M
from 6:00 PM until 10 PM.

00:34:43.996 --> 00:34:45.370
And then when I
was lucky, I'd be

00:34:45.370 --> 00:34:47.340
able to get a late
night catering job

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:50.010
serving food or serving
drinks from like 11:00 PM

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.949
to 2:00 AM or 3:00 AM.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.706
Rinse, wash, repeat, do the
same thing the next day.

00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:57.330
I was there with
meaning, with purpose.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:58.580
I was there for a reason.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:00.755
I was happy,
actually, doing this

00:35:00.755 --> 00:35:02.380
because I knew I was
in the right place

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:06.010
to pursue my endeavors
to work as a storyteller

00:35:06.010 --> 00:35:09.250
in the entertainment industry.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:11.990
The crazy thing about this is
how many people in my circle

00:35:11.990 --> 00:35:15.562
and in my life told me how
stupid I was for doing this.

00:35:15.562 --> 00:35:17.050
Like, what are you doing?

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:21.970
Why would you give up a good job
with benefits, a 401(k) plan,

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:23.680
all these different
things, to do this,

00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:26.461
to go into this uncertainty?

00:35:26.461 --> 00:35:27.960
Maybe you're going
to hear that when

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.980
you make some different
and difficult decisions

00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.650
over the course of your life and
you learn the lesson that what

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:40.830
makes you happy, it may
make others uncomfortable.

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.070
What makes you happy may
make others uncomfortable.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:46.475
And that's OK.

00:35:46.475 --> 00:35:47.850
Just because you're
going one way

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:50.790
doesn't mean it's the wrong
way people-- specifically,

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:54.300
our family-- have a vested
interest in us being well

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.670
taken care of and protected.

00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:56.730
They love you.

00:35:56.730 --> 00:35:58.250
So just know, if
you make a decision

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:02.060
that goes counter to what they
expect, they may not be happy.

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.724
But you gotta focus on you
and what's most important.

00:36:04.724 --> 00:36:07.140
So back in that studio with
that red light and that camera

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.910
on me, what seemed like
a matter of minutes

00:36:10.910 --> 00:36:14.670
was actually just a few seconds,
like a couple of seconds.

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:16.310
But I was able to
go through my mind

00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:19.669
that whole story of selling
cheese, of moving to New York

00:36:19.669 --> 00:36:21.085
City with $700 in
my bank account,

00:36:21.085 --> 00:36:24.044
of working all those jobs, all
those things from my background

00:36:24.044 --> 00:36:26.210
that got me to that moment
of being on the x in that

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:28.630
studio with those three
cameras in front of me.

00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:32.820
And I knew right then and there
that I had to make a decision.

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:34.790
And that decision was
to lean into the fear

00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:36.006
or lean into the excitement.

00:36:36.006 --> 00:36:37.880
I couldn't articulate
it like that back then.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.080
But I knew I had a
decision to make.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.360
It was a willingness to bet on
me, actually double down on me

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.000
or not.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.370
And I remember taking a
breath, looking at the camera.

00:36:47.370 --> 00:36:48.060
And I smiled.

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:48.670
And I made a decision.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:49.120
This is it.

00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.480
And I said, what's
up, everybody?

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.230
It's a brand new episode
of "U-Pick Live."

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.000
Coming up today,
we have-- whoever

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.094
happened to be on
the show that day.

00:36:57.094 --> 00:36:59.010
I really believe that
that moment right there,

00:36:59.010 --> 00:37:01.464
being willing to choose me
in the face of uncertainty,

00:37:01.464 --> 00:37:03.380
led to my being able to
work in the television

00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:07.229
industry for over 10 years
with a lot of top networks.

00:37:07.229 --> 00:37:09.770
Over the course of your career,
over the course of your life,

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.892
you are going to have a
lot of red light moments.

00:37:11.892 --> 00:37:13.600
And I hope all of you
are willing to lean

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.450
into the excitement as
opposed to the fear.

00:37:16.450 --> 00:37:18.730
Now, after you've been
willing to turn up the volume

00:37:18.730 --> 00:37:21.170
and do the work when no one
is watching and find the edge

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:22.910
and lean into the excitement
as opposed to fear,

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:24.326
the last thing I
really want to do

00:37:24.326 --> 00:37:27.850
is be willing to find
people who make you better.

00:37:27.850 --> 00:37:30.220
This seems obvious, but
it doesn't happen as much

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:31.962
as I would like to think.

00:37:31.962 --> 00:37:34.420
When I was an undergraduate at
Western Michigan University,

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.245
I walked on the
track and field team.

00:37:36.245 --> 00:37:38.930
If you know anything about being
a walk-on in track and field,

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:40.429
that means you try
out for the team.

00:37:40.429 --> 00:37:43.220
And if you're fortunate
enough, you made the team.

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.232
And I made the team as a long
jumper and triple jumper.

00:37:46.232 --> 00:37:47.940
But after two years
of being on the team,

00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.390
I wasn't doing so hot.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:50.755
I wasn't doing well.

00:37:50.755 --> 00:37:52.840
I remember my head coach
coming up to me one day.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.741
And he said, Antonio,
you're not doing so well.

00:37:56.741 --> 00:37:59.240
He said, in two years of being
on this track and field team,

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:03.840
you have not placed in
one major competition.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.030
That was the agreement,
the bargain that we made,

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.740
is that you would help us
win track competitions.

00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:10.370
But in two years of
being on this team,

00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:13.162
you have not placed in
a major competition.

00:38:13.162 --> 00:38:13.870
And he was right.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.411
I think the only thing that I
placed first in those first two

00:38:16.411 --> 00:38:18.890
years was in line at
McDonald's after our track

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:21.479
and field meets.

00:38:21.479 --> 00:38:23.270
And I thought at that
moment Coach Shaw was

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:24.519
going to cut me from the team.

00:38:24.519 --> 00:38:27.020
And I would lose my
opportunity to potentially earn

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.860
a scholarship, which
would have been really

00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:30.480
helpful because my
mother at that time

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.210
was paying for my tuition
on her credit card.

00:38:33.210 --> 00:38:34.627
But Coach Shaw didn't cut me.

00:38:34.627 --> 00:38:36.960
Instead, he did something
else that was really powerful.

00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.200
He said, Antonio, I don't
know if you know this,

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:43.870
but we have two all-Americans
on our track and field team.

00:38:43.870 --> 00:38:45.690
And he pointed to
them on the track.

00:38:45.690 --> 00:38:47.940
We have two all-Americans
on our track and field team.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:50.430
Yet, in the two years that
you've been on the roster,

00:38:50.430 --> 00:38:53.869
not once have I seen you
spend any time with them.

00:38:53.869 --> 00:38:54.410
He was right.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.290
One gentleman would go on
to compete in the Olympics.

00:38:57.290 --> 00:38:59.500
Another one would
go on to compete

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.675
in the world championships.

00:39:01.675 --> 00:39:03.050
He said, instead,
Antonio, you're

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:04.870
hanging out with those guys.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.895
And he pointed over
to the high jump mat.

00:39:06.895 --> 00:39:08.770
Now, if you know anything
about the high jump

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:11.061
mat in middle school or high
school or collegiate track

00:39:11.061 --> 00:39:15.730
and field, the high jump
mat is essentially the club.

00:39:15.730 --> 00:39:18.320
That's the people, your
teammates go, hang out, laugh,

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.650
lay back, and relax.

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:22.540
And that's where I spent
the majority of my time.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.600
It's not that my teammates
on that high jump mat

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.010
were bad people and
doing bad things.

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:30.027
But they weren't all-Americans.

00:39:30.027 --> 00:39:30.610
And it's true.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.010
I didn't spend time
with those all-Americans

00:39:32.010 --> 00:39:33.635
because they got up
earlier than I did.

00:39:33.635 --> 00:39:35.080
They ate better than I did.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.220
They passed on the
parties that I went to.

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:39.190
Why would I do that,
even though my mother

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.320
was paying for my tuition
on her credit card?

00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:43.560
Coach Shaw walked away.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.766
He didn't cut me.

00:39:44.766 --> 00:39:46.640
But what Coach Shaw did
for me in that moment

00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:51.720
was introduced me to this
concept of thieves and allies.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.190
Thieves are those people
that don't encourage you,

00:39:54.190 --> 00:39:57.330
that don't inspire you,
that don't challenge you,

00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:59.220
that don't push
you, that don't hold

00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:01.320
you accountable to
be the absolute best

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.091
version of yourself.

00:40:03.091 --> 00:40:05.090
Thieves are those people
you spend a lot of time

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:07.827
having brunch with talking
about all the things

00:40:07.827 --> 00:40:09.910
that you're going to do,
knowing that you're never

00:40:09.910 --> 00:40:12.060
going to do them.

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:15.610
Thieves are those people that my
friend, the author John Gordon,

00:40:15.610 --> 00:40:17.452
calls energy vampires.

00:40:17.452 --> 00:40:19.410
You know those people
you spend time with them,

00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.540
and after they leave,
you have less energy

00:40:21.540 --> 00:40:24.152
than when they arrived?

00:40:24.152 --> 00:40:26.110
These are those people
that somehow always have

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.590
drama going on in their lives.

00:40:28.590 --> 00:40:31.090
You know anyone who has drama
always going on in their life?

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:31.670
You call them.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:32.060
What's up?

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:32.570
How are you?

00:40:32.570 --> 00:40:34.140
And they say, you're
not going to believe

00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:35.125
what just happened to me.

00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:36.874
It's like, why are
things always happening

00:40:36.874 --> 00:40:38.710
to you and no one else?

00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:40.289
You know those people?

00:40:40.289 --> 00:40:42.330
And on the flipside, the
opportunity that we have

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.994
is a spent time with allies.

00:40:43.994 --> 00:40:45.910
Allies are those people
that do encourage you,

00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:48.100
that do inspire you,
that do challenge you,

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:51.050
that do push you, that
do hold you accountable,

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:54.370
that test you to be the absolute
best version of yourself.

00:40:54.370 --> 00:40:56.717
Allies are those people
that you do spend time

00:40:56.717 --> 00:40:59.300
with at lunch talking about all
the things you're going to do.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:03.980
Then you leave lunch or brunch,
and begin working on them.

00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.730
Allies are those people
that don't take energy away

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:07.230
from you.

00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:09.761
They give you energy.

00:41:09.761 --> 00:41:11.260
Allies aren't those
people that have

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.560
drama going on in their lives.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:17.127
They actually have great
things going on in their lives.

00:41:17.127 --> 00:41:18.960
The beautiful thing is
that not only can you

00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:22.100
surround yourself with
allies, but you can also

00:41:22.100 --> 00:41:25.212
be an ally to others.

00:41:25.212 --> 00:41:27.170
What I'd you do right
now is just take a second

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.300
and visualize the five people,
the five people, that you spend

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:34.500
the most time with and ask
yourself a really simple,

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.210
yet challenging question.

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:40.630
And that is, do they
make you better?

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:42.630
Do the five people you
spend the most time with,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.194
do they make you better?

00:41:44.194 --> 00:41:46.360
I ask this question across
the country all the time.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.355
And I see some people just
shake their head, like no.

00:41:49.355 --> 00:41:51.730
You see, the thing about allies
is they provide something

00:41:51.730 --> 00:41:54.260
that I like to call-- they
provide good friction.

00:41:54.260 --> 00:41:57.960
And I invite all of you to find
good friction in your life.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.010
I'm from up north in Michigan.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:02.150
And we get a lot
of snow up there.

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:04.720
And every now and then, a car
can get stuck in the snow.

00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.640
And that tire will just
be spinning in the snow.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.940
But for us, to get
that tire moving

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:11.440
and get out of that
snow, what we do

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:13.120
is try to create friction.

00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:16.290
So we'll put kitty
litter under that tire.

00:42:16.290 --> 00:42:17.540
And it will propel us forward.

00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.340
Or we'll put sand
under the tire.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.140
And it will propel us
forward, or salt, you name it.

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.590
In dire circumstances
in the woods,

00:42:26.590 --> 00:42:29.309
you can start a fire with
two sticks and some kindling.

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:30.600
I like to think about diamonds.

00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.670
How are diamonds formed?

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:36.090
Under millions and millions
of years of pressure.

00:42:36.090 --> 00:42:40.690
The soil wasn't massaging
the shoulders of diamonds.

00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:42.426
I invite all of you
to be willing to find

00:42:42.426 --> 00:42:43.550
good friction in your life.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:45.508
Those allies are going
to hold you accountable,

00:42:45.508 --> 00:42:48.690
but they will take you
further in your life as well.

00:42:48.690 --> 00:42:50.405
What I find when I
go to corporations

00:42:50.405 --> 00:42:52.780
and I go to universities is
we're in an interesting place

00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.050
right now.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:54.716
And that's really
scary for me because I

00:42:54.716 --> 00:42:58.260
find that if someone receives
the slightest bit of feedback

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:00.645
that they disagree with,
the first response is

00:43:00.645 --> 00:43:02.200
that person is an idiot.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:04.630
My manager doesn't know what
he or she is talking about.

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:06.510
Or if someone doesn't
agree with the thought

00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:09.008
that you have, on many college
campuses, people are like,

00:43:09.008 --> 00:43:10.008
we should get him fired.

00:43:12.602 --> 00:43:14.060
I invite you to
find good friction.

00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.018
Things can come from
that, especially when it's

00:43:16.018 --> 00:43:19.792
constructive feedback
in our lives.

00:43:19.792 --> 00:43:22.000
Think all those times someone
has disagreed with you.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.419
Have been willing to find that
good friction in your life?

00:43:25.419 --> 00:43:27.460
When I was in grad school
at Columbia University,

00:43:27.460 --> 00:43:29.850
I remember turning in
my master's thesis.

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:33.020
And I'd be so afraid because I
knew my master's advisor, when

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.150
he finished with it, it'd
be covered in red ink.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.150
And I'd have so much
more work to do.

00:43:37.150 --> 00:43:40.020
And he saw my trepidation
of submitting my thesis

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:41.247
to get reviewed.

00:43:41.247 --> 00:43:42.830
And one day, he
looked at me and said,

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:48.900
point blank, Antonio, don't you
know you pay for the red ink?

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.520
You pay for the red ink.

00:43:50.520 --> 00:43:52.459
Find the value in that.

00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:53.500
Not what's wrong with it.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.590
Find the value in that.

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.660
I think the challenging
times we're in right now

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.310
also involve this right
here, like many ways

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.809
we're doing things, I think,
for a lot of the wrong reasons.

00:44:02.809 --> 00:44:05.690
We're doing things for likes,
for retweets, for double taps,

00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.165
for views, shares, you name it.

00:44:09.165 --> 00:44:10.790
I have a decent social
media following.

00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:13.130
But I can tell you right
now, if I really need support

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.505
and I really need
guidance, I can

00:44:14.505 --> 00:44:17.130
count on these two hands who
really is going to be there

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.370
for me in this life.

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:22.380
Those are those allies.

00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:25.720
I invite you to
know that supporters

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.510
are greater than followers.

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:31.020
Over the course of
your career, supporters

00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:33.050
are going to be
greater than followers.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:37.512
And know that "we"
is greater than "me."

00:44:37.512 --> 00:44:38.970
I invite you over
the next few days

00:44:38.970 --> 00:44:41.715
to pay attention to the language
that you use as you communicate

00:44:41.715 --> 00:44:42.965
with colleagues and your team.

00:44:42.965 --> 00:44:46.970
And see if you say "I"
and "me" more than you

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:52.040
say "we" and "us." "I" and "me",
when it comes to communication,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.450
creates distance.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.730
"We" and "us," it
brings us closer.

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.600
It brings us together as a team.

00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:03.000
And it allows us to collaborate
that much more easily.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.122
Now, look, I really believe
that if you regularly

00:45:06.122 --> 00:45:08.580
turn up the volume and do the
work when no one is watching,

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.219
great things can
happen in your career.

00:45:10.219 --> 00:45:12.260
I believe that if you're
willing to find the edge

00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:14.780
and lean into the excitement
as opposed to the fear,

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:16.830
amazing things will
happen in your career.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.820
And if you find the
people who make you better

00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.320
and spent time with allies
as opposed to thieves,

00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:24.769
you will get
exceptional results.

00:45:24.769 --> 00:45:26.435
The beautiful thing
is this is that this

00:45:26.435 --> 00:45:28.870
is what you have right now in
your life with this internship

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:29.230
in your life.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:31.750
You have a blank canvas, the
one that we showed you earlier.

00:45:31.750 --> 00:45:34.210
It's your opportunity to
paint, to sculpt, to create

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:35.940
what you most want to create.

00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:39.290
But it's going to require you
to have that CEO mentality,

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:41.860
being willing to be
proactive versus reactive,

00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:44.849
having an agenda, identifying
what's most important.

00:45:44.849 --> 00:45:47.140
And I cannot promise you that
everything is going to go

00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:48.848
fantastic over the
course of your career.

00:45:48.848 --> 00:45:49.390
It will not.

00:45:49.390 --> 00:45:51.904
There'll be bad days,
bad weeks, bad months.

00:45:51.904 --> 00:45:53.570
But I think about a
time I was reporting

00:45:53.570 --> 00:45:55.620
a story on Juneau, Alaska.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:58.440
If you know anything about
the weather in Juneau, Alaska,

00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.590
it rains a lot.

00:46:00.590 --> 00:46:02.340
I remember walking
around downtown Juneau,

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:03.710
Alaska with a big umbrella.

00:46:03.710 --> 00:46:07.630
And I noticed that none of the
locals were using umbrellas.

00:46:07.630 --> 00:46:08.880
I got confused.

00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:09.760
I went up to a local.

00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.718
I said, excuse me, sir.

00:46:10.718 --> 00:46:11.850
I'm not from here.

00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:13.640
But I noticed no one
here uses umbrellas.

00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.210
Why is that?

00:46:15.210 --> 00:46:15.886
He looked at me.

00:46:15.886 --> 00:46:16.635
He had glasses on.

00:46:16.635 --> 00:46:17.810
They beaded up with water.

00:46:17.810 --> 00:46:20.270
And he said, you know, man.

00:46:20.270 --> 00:46:21.130
It's just water.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.650
It's just water.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.660
When you're having that
bad day, that project

00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:30.530
wasn't received the way
you thought it would,

00:46:30.530 --> 00:46:31.640
know that it's just water.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:33.640
And sometimes, we have
to let ourselves get wet.

00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:36.597
We have to get drenched
and learn from that.

00:46:36.597 --> 00:46:37.430
That builds up grit.

00:46:37.430 --> 00:46:38.760
That builds up resilience.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:39.967
That builds up perseverance.

00:46:39.967 --> 00:46:41.550
That builds up
character, those things

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:47.020
that allow us to plow ahead
forward in the future.

00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:49.870
The truth is this, that no one
cares-- and I hate to say this,

00:46:49.870 --> 00:46:54.000
but no one cares more about you
and your career than you do.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.420
Yes, your advisor
at college does.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.260
But they can't
care more than you.

00:46:57.260 --> 00:46:58.610
Yes, your manager cares.

00:46:58.610 --> 00:47:00.500
But they can't
care more than you.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.514
Yes, your parents care.

00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:02.930
But they can't
care more than you.

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.138
Your significant other cares.

00:47:04.138 --> 00:47:06.434
But they cannot
care more than you.

00:47:06.434 --> 00:47:07.850
At the end of the
day, the results

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:11.330
you do or do not get in
your career are up to you.

00:47:11.330 --> 00:47:14.001
Effort is between you and you.

00:47:14.001 --> 00:47:15.500
You know what you're
willing to give

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.860
and what you are not giving.

00:47:17.860 --> 00:47:20.850
People always give me
this notion that college,

00:47:20.850 --> 00:47:23.650
the best years of your life.

00:47:23.650 --> 00:47:24.762
I think that's rubbish.

00:47:24.762 --> 00:47:26.240
That's some amazing years.

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:28.500
But I'm a firm
believer that the best

00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:31.560
thing that has ever
happened to any of you

00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:34.546
has not happened yet.

00:47:34.546 --> 00:47:36.920
And that's how I invite you
wake up every single day when

00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:38.557
you have this blank canvas.

00:47:38.557 --> 00:47:39.890
Thank you so much for having me.

00:47:39.890 --> 00:47:40.990
I really appreciate it.

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:41.730
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:41.730 --> 00:47:42.230
Yeah.

00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:42.980
Thank you.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:45.500
Thank you.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.990
Definitely feel free to
come say hello online.

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:53.610
The question was, what has
been the biggest challenge

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.280
in your career?

00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.290
And I think a couple
things pop in my mind.

00:47:57.290 --> 00:48:00.000
One the biggest
challenges was learning

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.430
how to break the cycle.

00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:03.370
I come from a family
that didn't go

00:48:03.370 --> 00:48:05.680
to college, that hasn't
necessarily been professionals

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:06.440
in their life.

00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:09.330
So before me, there
was no track record.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.600
There was no blueprint.

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.030
So in many ways, I had to
figure this out on my own.

00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:16.920
But I quickly realized I
can't do this by myself.

00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.990
So I've been able in the course
of my career to surround myself

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.569
with a lot of great
mentors and people

00:48:22.569 --> 00:48:25.110
who have been there, who have
done that, to get through those

00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:26.220
challenging times.

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:27.880
Because again, I
had no blueprint.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.255
There was no one in my family
that I could go to and say,

00:48:30.255 --> 00:48:31.920
hey, I'm experiencing
X, Y, and Z

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:33.720
because they hadn't
experienced that.

00:48:33.720 --> 00:48:35.610
So as they say, it
takes a village.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:36.110
Right?

00:48:36.110 --> 00:48:40.037
And sometimes we have to
create our own village

00:48:40.037 --> 00:48:41.120
and identify those people.

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.090
And again, people are
willing to support you.

00:48:43.090 --> 00:48:47.450
But is there a willingness to
be humble and ask for that help?

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.410
Also, I showed you all these
networks and those cool things

00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.620
that have happened in
my career, but I've

00:48:52.620 --> 00:48:54.760
been fired from jobs as well.

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:57.750
Contracts haven't been renewed.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.331
And that willingness,
that knowingness, again,

00:49:01.331 --> 00:49:03.580
to hold-- the best thing
that has ever happened to you

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:04.800
hasn't happened yet.

00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.090
I've had to remind myself of
that during challenging times.

00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:10.200
The television industry
is extremely volatile.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:13.310
One day you're hot,
the next you're not.

00:49:13.310 --> 00:49:16.130
And so I had to know that
my validation in this life

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:18.900
can't come from
exterior motives.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.870
On Facebook, I have one of
those blue verification badges,

00:49:22.870 --> 00:49:24.015
like you verified.

00:49:24.015 --> 00:49:26.640
And one day, a student asked me,
earnestly, he's like, Antonio,

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:30.660
how can I get verified on
Facebook or Twitter or Google+,

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.140
you name it.

00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:33.707
And I looked at them.

00:49:33.707 --> 00:49:35.040
And I started giving the answer.

00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.120
Well, look, I work
in television.

00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:36.828
I'm a journalist.

00:49:36.828 --> 00:49:38.250
And I stopped.

00:49:38.250 --> 00:49:41.160
And I said, don't you know
that you were verified

00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:44.330
the day that you were born?

00:49:44.330 --> 00:49:48.190
That can't no blue
badge you verify you?

00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:49.590
No blue badge can verify you.

00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:50.090
Really?

00:49:50.090 --> 00:49:51.870
Oh, now I'm verified
because this organization

00:49:51.870 --> 00:49:52.578
says I'm someone?

00:49:52.578 --> 00:49:53.525
No.

00:49:53.525 --> 00:49:54.900
And for a long
time in television

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:58.570
I sought out external
rewards and acknowledgement,

00:49:58.570 --> 00:50:01.535
and had to realize it
started here, inside.

00:50:01.535 --> 00:50:04.630
So I hope that
answered your question.

00:50:04.630 --> 00:50:06.470
That's the short answer.

00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:09.560
But I'd be willing to talk
more about that afterwards.

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:10.810
You have a question over here.

00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:13.360
Just stand up and you can
just project your voice.

00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:14.940
Absolutely, the
question is, Antonio,

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:16.481
over the course of
your lives, people

00:50:16.481 --> 00:50:18.250
are going to say, hey,
what's your story?

00:50:18.250 --> 00:50:20.110
Or tell me about yourself.

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.274
And that's a big
opportunity for you.

00:50:22.274 --> 00:50:24.690
Unfortunately, when I see
people early on in their career,

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.180
they tend to give
the resume answer.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:30.980
I'm a junior at Western
Michigan University.

00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:33.812
I'm studying in marketing.

00:50:33.812 --> 00:50:35.940
I'm originally from Jackson.

00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.770
And there's this long, boring,
chronological story that

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:40.740
makes me want to fall asleep.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.730
And it's not because
they're bad people.

00:50:42.730 --> 00:50:45.190
It's just that no one has
told them anything otherwise.

00:50:45.190 --> 00:50:48.369
Now, your goal when someone
says, what's your story,

00:50:48.369 --> 00:50:50.410
tell me about yourself--
whether it's on a plane,

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:53.720
in line at Starbucks, or in a
job interview-- is hopefully

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.650
to get this response from
that person after you answer.

00:50:56.650 --> 00:50:58.480
And that is this.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.480
Tell me more about that.

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.340
Your goal is to get someone to
say, tell me more about that,

00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:04.530
to draw them in.

00:51:04.530 --> 00:51:07.040
So what I invite all of
you to do is take some time

00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:09.800
and identify three
things in your life

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.230
that really make you unique,
that not many people know

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.660
about you, those
things that would never

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.132
show up on a resume.

00:51:17.132 --> 00:51:18.590
Many times, those
things will never

00:51:18.590 --> 00:51:20.480
show up in a Google search.

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.770
I mean, there are many students
that work full-time while going

00:51:24.770 --> 00:51:26.314
to school full-time.

00:51:26.314 --> 00:51:27.730
They don't think
it's no big deal.

00:51:27.730 --> 00:51:28.570
They're just doing
what they gotta

00:51:28.570 --> 00:51:30.190
do to pay for their education.

00:51:30.190 --> 00:51:32.850
But I can tell you right now,
if you were in a job interview,

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:34.558
and someone says, tell
me about yourself,

00:51:34.558 --> 00:51:37.310
and you started off with well,
I'm a student at Kennesaw State

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:40.670
University and I work full-time
to pay for my education,

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.460
right then and there, that
person who is interviewing you

00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:46.420
is going to know something
special about you.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.700
This person is really willing to
put in the work and the effort.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.659
Or if you happen to be
an international student

00:51:51.659 --> 00:51:53.741
and you mention that I'm
an international student.

00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:55.530
I'm originally from
XYZ country, which

00:51:55.530 --> 00:51:56.738
is not a country, by the way.

00:51:56.738 --> 00:52:00.260
I'm just saying XYZ
just for an example.

00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:01.390
I'm from XYZ country.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:03.039
I came here to
pursue my education.

00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:05.330
And you tell a little bit of
that story, the arc of how

00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:08.770
you got here, that's a lot.

00:52:08.770 --> 00:52:11.180
You know how hard it
is to uproot yourself

00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:14.306
from another country and
then move to another country

00:52:14.306 --> 00:52:16.680
and then maybe learn something
and study something that's

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:18.585
not your first language?

00:52:18.585 --> 00:52:19.460
That draws people in.

00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:21.209
That means you're
willing to find the edge

00:52:21.209 --> 00:52:22.280
and get uncomfortable.

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:25.250
Some people with different
organizations do mission trips.

00:52:25.250 --> 00:52:27.130
And they go and they
volunteer their time.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:30.090
And they teach English,
or they do other things.

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:32.930
Find those things that would
never show up on a resume.

00:52:32.930 --> 00:52:33.430
Right?

00:52:33.430 --> 00:52:35.120
I tell people, I
used to sell cheese.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.152
Tell me more about
that, Antonio.

00:52:37.152 --> 00:52:39.235
But those things, again,
that would never show up,

00:52:39.235 --> 00:52:40.410
that would draw them in.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:45.850
And what that does is it
creates a human connection, not

00:52:45.850 --> 00:52:47.100
a business transaction.

00:52:47.100 --> 00:52:49.100
Your goal is to create
a human connection.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:51.450
The best job interviews are
the ones where you rarely

00:52:51.450 --> 00:52:52.740
talk about the resume.

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.202
You know you've got somebody
during a job interview when

00:52:55.202 --> 00:52:56.660
they're like this
in the beginning.

00:52:56.660 --> 00:52:58.500
Then they just put it down.

00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:00.535
You start having a
human conversation.

00:53:00.535 --> 00:53:02.160
So those things that
people would never

00:53:02.160 --> 00:53:03.249
find on your resume.

00:53:03.249 --> 00:53:05.540
And sometimes it's really
hard to identify those things

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:06.417
on your own.

00:53:06.417 --> 00:53:08.250
So have a conversation
with a friend or just

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:10.690
to interview like a journalist
to get some of those

00:53:10.690 --> 00:53:11.710
to come out.

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:13.624
I hope that was helpful.

00:53:13.624 --> 00:53:15.290
Right, so the question
is, if you're not

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.810
a person who
energizes others, what

00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:22.300
can you do to help that
person to become that?

00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:23.870
So listen, I want
to make sure we're

00:53:23.870 --> 00:53:25.078
talking about the same thing.

00:53:25.078 --> 00:53:27.610
Are we talking about being
a negative energy vampire?

00:53:27.610 --> 00:53:29.740
Or you're just more,
let's say, introverted

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:32.070
in communicating with others
in certain capacities?

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.466
It isn't natural for you.

00:53:33.466 --> 00:53:36.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:36.510 --> 00:53:37.520
ANTONIO NEVES: OK.

00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:40.704
Look, those energy
vampires, that's

00:53:40.704 --> 00:53:42.370
a whole other
conversation that I really

00:53:42.370 --> 00:53:44.270
can't answer on this stage.

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.950
The biggest thing is awareness.

00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:47.530
Sometimes, when you
make people aware

00:53:47.530 --> 00:53:50.507
that they can be a
negative influence

00:53:50.507 --> 00:53:53.090
on a room or a gathering, they
may get a little bit defensive.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:55.900
So you have to hope that they
are open to actually hearing

00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.920
that feedback.

00:53:56.920 --> 00:54:00.700
If it's unsolicited, just know
they may not receive it well.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.129
If you're not naturally
an extroverted person

00:54:03.129 --> 00:54:04.545
and you can be a
little bit quiet,

00:54:04.545 --> 00:54:07.520
you're a little bit reserved,
I'll just give example.

00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.280
When you go to a
networking event,

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.572
just don't make
it a numbers game.

00:54:11.572 --> 00:54:13.530
Some people go to networking
events or meetings

00:54:13.530 --> 00:54:15.240
or gatherings or
company gatherings,

00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.070
and they try to meet everyone.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:19.430
And that's absolutely
exhausting.

00:54:19.430 --> 00:54:21.524
What I'd say is, it's
OK to be who you are.

00:54:21.524 --> 00:54:23.690
Don't shy away from that
and all of a sudden present

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.290
yourself as someone you're
not, some big personality.

00:54:26.290 --> 00:54:30.040
But in that event you attend,
find one or two people

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.590
to connect with and choose
quality over quantity, where

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.610
you actually can be yourself.

00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:39.165
Nothing is more exhausting
than not being you

00:54:39.165 --> 00:54:40.710
and not being yourself.

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:41.530
Don't get me wrong.

00:54:41.530 --> 00:54:42.980
You're going to find
situations in job interviews

00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:45.195
where you do need to
have that good posture,

00:54:45.195 --> 00:54:46.109
that forward energy.

00:54:46.109 --> 00:54:47.900
You're going to have
to project your voice.

00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.400
To give talks on
stage, you may have

00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.570
to-- there are things
you can do with that.

00:54:51.570 --> 00:54:54.030
But I think in human
interactions, just be yourself.

00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:56.010
But don't try to
connect with everybody.

00:54:56.010 --> 00:54:58.051
Instead of trying to talk
to five people and once

00:54:58.051 --> 00:55:00.070
and be that big storyteller,
if that's not you,

00:55:00.070 --> 00:55:01.440
connect one-on-one.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:03.040
Know where you shine.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:06.060
And know where you don't shine.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:06.560
Right?

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:08.110
Yeah.

00:55:08.110 --> 00:55:09.700
The question is, how
do you figure out

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.533
where you want to go
eventually if you don't

00:55:11.533 --> 00:55:12.840
know where you want to go?

00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:13.070
Right?

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:13.944
It's a good question.

00:55:13.944 --> 00:55:16.150
It's a conundrum, one that
I've experienced before.

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:17.900
My answer to that is
just your willingness

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:22.140
to be curious and not
put pressure on yourself

00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:23.370
to actually know.

00:55:23.370 --> 00:55:25.420
You may have an
overarching interest.

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.130
Say it's in technology.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:27.630
Right?

00:55:27.630 --> 00:55:29.004
So it may not make
a lot of sense

00:55:29.004 --> 00:55:32.310
for you to pursue working
in the hotel industry.

00:55:32.310 --> 00:55:33.361
Right?

00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:35.360
Well, that actually could
be technology as well.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.190
But I have a chapter in my book.

00:55:37.190 --> 00:55:41.407
And it's titled, "Your First
Job Won't Be Your Last Job."

00:55:41.407 --> 00:55:43.240
So I invite you not to
put a lot of pressure

00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.300
on yourself to
get that first job

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:47.210
right because knowing
that in a couple years,

00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.626
you're going to
go somewhere else.

00:55:48.626 --> 00:55:53.249
But your willingness to get
curious and try new things out,

00:55:53.249 --> 00:55:54.790
again, knowing that
this is not going

00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:57.210
be my final position or
my final decision ever.

00:55:57.210 --> 00:56:00.470
But what can I learn
from this situation?

00:56:00.470 --> 00:56:02.354
So a lot of times,
it's trial and error.

00:56:02.354 --> 00:56:04.520
Just get curious, but don't
put pressure on yourself

00:56:04.520 --> 00:56:05.800
to make the right decision.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.050
And I think in due
time, as you accumulate

00:56:08.050 --> 00:56:10.930
data, like life data, you're
going to learn what you like

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:12.092
and what you don't like.

00:56:12.092 --> 00:56:13.550
Don't forget that
is just as viable

00:56:13.550 --> 00:56:16.680
to know what you don't want to
do as it is to know what you do

00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.710
want to do.

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:19.971
So for me, when I spent
a year doing something.

00:56:19.971 --> 00:56:20.970
I don't want to do that.

00:56:20.970 --> 00:56:21.750
Selling cheese?

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:24.770
That was like, yes, I know
I don't want to sell cheese.

00:56:24.770 --> 00:56:26.100
That's a victory.

00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:29.024
Now, some people may frame it
another way-- I wasted a year.

00:56:29.024 --> 00:56:29.940
I didn't waste a year.

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:32.400
I learned something
I did not want to do.

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.330
So be willing to experiment
with things that you find out

00:56:35.330 --> 00:56:36.127
you don't like.

00:56:36.127 --> 00:56:36.710
And that's OK.

00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:37.570
It's a journey.

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:38.610
It's a big canvas.

00:56:38.610 --> 00:56:40.860
So there may be a small
corner of cheese in your life.

00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.050
But there's more room to paint.

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:43.970
Does that make sense?

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:44.670
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:56:44.670 --> 00:56:45.890
ANTONIO NEVES: Well, hey,
thank you so much everyone.

00:56:45.890 --> 00:56:46.730
I appreciate you.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:47.480
Thanks for coming.

00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.530
