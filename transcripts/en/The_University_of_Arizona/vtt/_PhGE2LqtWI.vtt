00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840
So without further
ado, please help

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.170
me give our next president
a warm University

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.455
of Arizona welcome.

00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:15.358
Dr. Bobby Robbins.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.310
I am very enthusiastic
about getting

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.300
started on this important
leadership position.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.660
I wanted to thank the
regents also and the members

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.890
of the search committee who
went through a rigorous process.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.090
I was born in a small
town in South Mississippi.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.070
I was raised by my
maternal grandparents.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.830
My grandfather was a
math professor at a small

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.810
we call it a junior college.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.470
I went on to a small
liberal arts school

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.380
after attending
that junior college

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.180
and then to medical school
at University of Mississippi

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.940
then to Columbia
University to do research.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.500
Spent two years at NIH.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.140
And then went to Stanford to
do my cardiothoracic surgery

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.980
training.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.320
And then from there, the
last 4 and 1/2 years,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.500
I've been the president and
CEO of the Texas Medical

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.680
Center, which is the largest
Medical Center in the world.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920
But I'm appreciative
of the opportunity

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.950
and thank you for asking me to
share my own personal story.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.280
This is a great
American university,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.080
and it's something that
we should all be proud of.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.410
The incredible
legacy and history

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:37.030
of the university
around research,

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.430
being a research-intensive
university,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.550
I think it's outstanding.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.350
And one of my
objectives as I take

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.800
this leadership role is to
tell the great story that I

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.240
think we have here at U of A.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.510
The world is changing.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.590
It's changing in ways
that we need to be

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.750
and I think are
well-positioned to be

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.040
leaders in the area of
diversity, of access,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.900
of affordability.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.699
There is a fast-moving
world out there.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.910
I think that it is tailor-made
for the University of Arizona

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.390
to be on the leading
edge of this emerging

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.990
industrial revolution.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.570
For the students,
when they go out

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.270
in this competitive
global marketplace,

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.110
they will be prepared, not only
for the content and the skills

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.790
that they get here, but also
to remain intellectually

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.360
curious lifelong learners
and to have service

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.670
back to the community.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.880
Dr. Robbins, welcome.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.270
I am thrilled to
have you on board.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.030
Yours is a story
that we really need

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.150
to get out to the
public on what you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.570
are doing with less
resources and trying

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.890
to make a difference for
the state of Arizona.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.660
So thank you very much.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.490
Thank you for those
kind comments.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.900
I move that the board appoint
Dr. Robert Robbins as president

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.610
of the University of
Arizona and approve

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.440
his multiple-year
employment contract

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.630
and that the board
authorized me as board chair

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.420
to sign the contract
with Dr. Robbins.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.480
Is there a second?

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.160
Second.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.660
Discussion.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.860
You've heard the motion.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.660
Those in favor simply
count by saying aye.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.260
Aye.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.760
Those opposed, no.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.960
The ayes do have it.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.060
The ayes do have
it, and so ordered.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.860
