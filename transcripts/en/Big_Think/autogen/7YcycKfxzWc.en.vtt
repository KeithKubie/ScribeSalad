well I remember I do when I was in my

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969
well I remember I do when I was in my
 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.490
well I remember I do when I was in my
early teens I was really I started

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
early teens I was really I started
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350
early teens I was really I started
really getting into video games I mean

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360
really getting into video games I mean
 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.689
really getting into video games I mean
and the idea of I mean I just play video

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699
and the idea of I mean I just play video
 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.230
and the idea of I mean I just play video
games

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
games
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450
games
remember when Sega first came out it was

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
remember when Sega first came out it was
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970
remember when Sega first came out it was
into this video game it became my new

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980
into this video game it became my new
 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.630
into this video game it became my new
toy and I mean when video games went

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640
toy and I mean when video games went
 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.700
toy and I mean when video games went
three-dimensional on us

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710
three-dimensional on us
 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.620
three-dimensional on us
and so as I started you know so physics

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630
and so as I started you know so physics
 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.990
and so as I started you know so physics
for me is no different than being then

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000
for me is no different than being then
 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.970
for me is no different than being then
it's a form of entertainment for me it's

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980
it's a form of entertainment for me it's
 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.889
it's a form of entertainment for me it's
fun for me it's like playing this video

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899
fun for me it's like playing this video
 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.229
fun for me it's like playing this video
game and a lot of ways the reason why I

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239
game and a lot of ways the reason why I
 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.119
game and a lot of ways the reason why I
like doing physics the kind of physics I

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129
like doing physics the kind of physics I
 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.799
like doing physics the kind of physics I
do is that there's a lot of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809
do is that there's a lot of
 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.170
do is that there's a lot of
visualization going on or actually

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180
visualization going on or actually
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.209
visualization going on or actually
experimenting with different ways of

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
experimenting with different ways of
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.090
experimenting with different ways of
visualizing things and so it becomes

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100
visualizing things and so it becomes
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.000
visualizing things and so it becomes
this interesting video game or if you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010
this interesting video game or if you
 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.200
this interesting video game or if you
like translate and I do a lot of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210
like translate and I do a lot of
 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240
like translate and I do a lot of
translation between them these images

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250
translation between them these images
 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.520
translation between them these images
and equations so it's sort of like you

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530
and equations so it's sort of like you
 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.170
and equations so it's sort of like you
learn two different languages and the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180
learn two different languages and the
 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.670
learn two different languages and the
fun is in translating from one to the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680
fun is in translating from one to the
 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.250
fun is in translating from one to the
other or looking at something that's

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
other or looking at something that's
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.810
other or looking at something that's
completely understood already and

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820
completely understood already and
 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.030
completely understood already and
figuring out a completely different way

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040
figuring out a completely different way
 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.429
figuring out a completely different way
of seeing the same thing so physics for

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439
of seeing the same thing so physics for
 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.469
of seeing the same thing so physics for
me has always become this is like an

me has always become this is like an
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.780
me has always become this is like an
extension of this group a video game a

extension of this group a video game a
 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.620
extension of this group a video game a
video game of the mind

to go to this really interesting school
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020
to go to this really interesting school
reggae club and I should take my physics

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030
reggae club and I should take my physics
 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.300
reggae club and I should take my physics

sometimes with a colleague and we would
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.230
sometimes with a colleague and we would
have a pint and we'll be doing physics

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240
have a pint and we'll be doing physics
 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.700
