[MUSIC]

00:00:03.288 --> 00:00:06.549
The first thing you'll probably want to
do as a Georgia Tech student is register

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:07.560
for classes.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.400
You should check
the registrar's website for

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.130
information on when
registration is open.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.035
To access Oscar itself, you'll go to
oscar.gatech.edu and sign in with

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:24.305
your Georgia Tech ID, which is the nine
digit number that starts with nine zero.

00:00:24.305 --> 00:00:27.925
You'll use Oscar to register for
classes, withdraw from classes,

00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:31.335
get your grades, and
ultimately apply to graduate.
