00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.500
Let's do some practice problems
dealing with variable

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.190
expressions.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.240
So these first problems say
write the following in a more

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.185
condensed form by leaving out
the multiplication symbol or

00:00:11.185 --> 00:00:14.130
leaving out a multiplication
symbol.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.900
So here we have 2 times 11x, so
if we have 11 x's and then

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.100
we're going to have 2 times
those 11 x's, we're going to

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.970
have 22 x's.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.400
So another way you could view
this, 2 times 11x, you could

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.960
view this as being equal to 2
times 11, and all of that

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120
times x, and that's going
to be equal to 22 x's.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.065
You had 11 x's, you're going to
have 2 times as many x's,

00:00:44.065 --> 00:00:46.500
so you're going to
have 22 x's.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.700
Let's see, you have
1.35 times y.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510
Now here we're just going to do
a straight simplifying how

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.180
we write it.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.630
So 1.35 times y-- I'll do it
in a different color-- 1.35

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.720
times y-- that's a
little dot there.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.710
In algebra we can just get
rid of that dot symbol.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.760
If we have a variable following
a number, we know

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.220
that means 1.35 times
that variable.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.560
So that, we could rewrite as
just being equal to 1.35y.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.350
We've condensed it by
getting rid of the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.360
multiplication sign.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.540
Let's see, here we
have 3 times 1/4.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.000
Well, this is just straight
up multiplying a fraction.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.020
So in problem 3-- this was
problem 1, this is problem 2,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.190
problem 3-- 3 times 1/4, that's
the same thing as 3

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.500
over 1 times 1/4.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.050
Multiply the numerators,
you get 3.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.790
Multiply the denominators,
1 times 4, you get 4.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.560
So number 3, I got 3/4.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.740
And then finally, you
have 1/4 times z.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.650
We could do the exact same
thing we did up here in

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.030
problem number 2.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.950
This was the same
thing as 1.35y.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.130
That's the same thing
as 1.35 times y.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.180
So down here we could rewrite
this as either being equal to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:15.230
1/4z, or we could view this as
being equal to 1 over 4 times

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.260
z over 1, which is the same
thing as z times 1, over 4

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.980
times 1, or the same
thing as z over 4.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.560
So all of these are
equivalent.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.440
Now, what do they want
us to do down here?

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.610
Evaluate the following
expressions for a is equal to

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:47.320
3, b is equal to 2, c is equal
to 5, and d is equal to minus

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.860
4-- or, actually, I should say
negative 4 is the correct

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:51.540
terminology.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.160
Negative 4.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.110
So we just substitute.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.930
Every time we see an a, we're
going to put a minus 3 there,

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.660
or a negative 3 there.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.410
Every time we see a b, we'll
put a positive 2 there.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.180
Every time we see a c,
we'll put a 5 there.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.750
And every time we see a d, we'll
put a minus 4 there.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:09.710
And I'll do a couple of these.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.540
I won't do all of them, just
for the sake of time.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.240
So let's say problem number 5.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.640
They gave us 2 times
a plus 3 times b.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.340
Well, this is the same thing as
2 times-- instead of an a,

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.340
we know that a is going to
be equal to negative 3.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:36.930
So 2 times minus 3, plus
3 times b-- what's b?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.960
They're telling us that b is
equal to 2-- so 3 times 2.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.510
And what is this equal to?

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:50.840
2 times minus 3-- let me do it
in a different color-- 2 times

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.050
negative 3 is negative
6, plus 3 times 2.

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.580
3 times 2 is 6.

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.230
That's positive 6.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.180
So that is equal to 0.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.390
And notice the order
of operations.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.360
We did the multiplications, we
did the two multiplications

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.680
before we added the
two numbers.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.510
Multiplication and division
takes precedence over addition

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.030
and subtraction.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.160
Let's do problem 6.

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.850
I'll do that right here.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.320
So you have 4 times c.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.180
4 times-- now what's
c equal to?

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.260
They tell us c is equal to 5.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.080
So 4 times 5, that's
our c, plus d.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.375
d is minus or negative 4.

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:39.090
So we have 4 times 5 is 20, plus
negative 4-- that's the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.000
same thing as minus 4, so
that is equal to 16.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280
Problem 6.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.910
Now, let's do one of the
harder ones down here.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.690
This problem 10 looks a little
bit more daunting.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.650
Problem 10 right there.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.395
So we have a minus 4b in the
numerator, if you can read it,

00:04:59.395 --> 00:05:00.730
it's kind of small.

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.180
a is minus 3.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.570
So we have minus 3-- or negative
3-- minus 4 times b.

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.620
b is 2.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.520
So 4 times 2.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:19.240
Remember, this right here is
a, that right there is b.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.940
How do I know?

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.730
They're telling me up here.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.780
And then all of that over--
all of that is

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.670
over 3c plus 2d.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:41.630
So 3 times-- what was c?
c is 5 plus 2 times d.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.910
What is d?

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.350
d is negative 4.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.550
So let's figure this out.

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.440
So we have to do order
of operations.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.310
Multiplication comes first
before addition and

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.560
subtraction.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.900
So this is going to be equal
to minus 3 minus 4 times 2,

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:09.710
minus 8, all of that over-- 3
times 5 is 15, plus 2 times

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.590
negative 4 is negative 8,
or 15 plus negative

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.750
8 is 15 minus 8.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.330
And now, the numerator becomes
negative 3 minus 8, which is

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.870
negative 11.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.850
And the denominator is 15
minus 8, which is 7.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.510
So problem 10, we simplified
it to negative 11 over 7.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.920
Right there.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.450
Let's do a couple of
these over here.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.400
OK, we see some exponents.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.350
I'll pick one of the
harder ones.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:56.640
Let's do this one over
here, problem 18.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.850
So 2x squared minus 3x squared,
plus 5x minus 4.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.030
OK, well, this wasn't
that hard.

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.940
All of them are dealing
with x.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.100
But what we could do here--
let me write this down.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:12.680
2x squared minus 3x squared,
plus 5x minus 4.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:17.400
And they tell us that x is
equal to negative 1.

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.720
One thing we could do is
simplify this before we even

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:22.700
substitute for negative 1.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:25.340
So what's 2 of something
minus 3 of something?

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.460
Right?

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:30.750
This is 2x squareds
minus 3x squareds.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.780
So 2 of something minus 3 of
something, that's going to be

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:35.730
minus 1 of that something.

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:39.050
So that right there-- or
negative 1 of that something--

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:45.450
that would be negative 1x
squared plus 5x minus 4.

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.880
And they tell us x is
equal to negative 1.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:53.220
So this is negative 1 times x
squared, negative 1 squared,

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:58.500
plus 5 times x, which is
negative 1, minus 4.

00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.120
So what is this?

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.180
Negative 1 squared is just 1.

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:03.510
That's just 1.

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:08.780
So this whole expression
simplifies to negative 1 plus

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:11.140
5 times negative 1-- we do the

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:12.880
multiplication first, of course.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:17.690
So that's minus 5, or
negative 5 minus 4.

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:22.840
So negative 1 minus 5 is
negative 6, minus 4 is equal

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.710
to negative 10.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.369
And I'll do these last two just
to get a sample of all of

00:08:32.369 --> 00:08:38.299
the types of problems in this
variable expression section.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:42.380
The weekly cost, c, of
manufacturing x remote

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:47.050
controls-- so the cost is c, x
is the remote controls-- is

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.480
given by this formula.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:53.260
The cost is equal to 2,000 plus
3 times the number of

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.840
remote controls, where cost
is given in dollars.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.880
Question a, what is the
cost of producing

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:03.510
1,000 remote controls?

00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:06.330
Well, the number of remote
controls is x.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:10.010
So for part a-- I could write
it over here-- the cost is

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:15.090
going to be equal to-- just use
this formula-- 2,000 plus

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.840
3 times the number of
remote controls.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.880
x is the number of
remote controls.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:23.695
So 3 times 1,000.

00:09:23.695 --> 00:09:28.430
So it's going to be equal to
2,000 plus 3 times 1,000 is

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.810
3,000, which is equal
to $5,000.

00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.500
So that's part a. $5,000.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.530
Now part b.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:42.870
What is the cost of producing
2,000 remote controls?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:45.450
Well, the cost-- just use the
same formula-- is equal to

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:51.330
2,000 plus 3 times the number
of remote controls.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:56.350
So 3 times 2,000.

00:09:56.350 --> 00:10:02.050
So that's equal to 2,000 plus
3 times 2,000 is 6,000.

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:06.900
So that's equal to $8,000.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:09.770
Now we're at problem 22.

00:10:09.770 --> 00:10:13.720
The volume of a box without a
lid is given by the formula,

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.240
volume is equal to 4x times 10
minus x squared, where x is a

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.700
length in inches, and v is the
volume in cubic inches.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.700
What is the volume when
x is equal to 2?

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.570
So part a, x is equal to 2.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.790
We just substitute 2 wherever
we see an x here.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.170
So the volume is going to be
equal to 4 times x, which is

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:47.330
2, times 10 minus 2 squared.

00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:53.980
And so this is going to be equal
to 4 times 2 is 8, times

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:57.950
10 minus 2 is 8 squared.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.550
So that's 8 times-- so this
is equal to 8 times--

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:04.460
8 squared is 64.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.000
You could say this is going to
be 8 to the third power.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.380
And 64 times 8-- 4
times 8 is 32.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:21.070
6 times 8 is 48, plus 3 is 51.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:27.430
So it's 512.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:31.500
Now, what is the volume
when x is equal to 3?

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:36.310
I'll do it here in pink. b, when
is equal to 3, then the

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:42.480
volume is equal to 4 times 3-- x
is equal to 3 now-- times 10

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.410
minus 3 squared.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:52.230
4 times 3 is 12, times 10
minus 3 is 7 squared.

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:56.390
So it's equal to 12 times 49.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:58.810
And just to get the exact
answer, let's multiply that.

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:05.740
So 49 times 12-- 2 times
9 is 18, 2 times 4 is

00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:08.335
8, plus 1 is 9.

00:12:08.335 --> 00:12:09.240
Put a 0.

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.180
1 times 9 is 9.

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:13.630
1 times 4 is 4.

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:15.912
And then we add the two.

00:12:15.912 --> 00:12:23.390
We get 8, 9 plus 9 is 18, and
then 1 plus 4 is 588.
