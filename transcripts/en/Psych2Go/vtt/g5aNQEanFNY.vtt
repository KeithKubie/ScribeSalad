Hello peoples of the Psych2Go comunity, my name is Matt and I'm stoked to be coming at you from my channel Das Kookie with another video.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.600
Today we're going to be chatting about that one creepy dude in the horror movie you just watched.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.060
Or really, I guess, just all the creepy people in horror movies. Ever.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:26.700
However, this video is not going to be creepy!  So watch on as we bring up 5 facts about psychopaths brought to your by our rad writer, Sophie.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.020
Fact 1: Psychopaths are animal driven

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.200
One of the more subtle characteristics of a psychopath is that they're animal driven.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.260
This means that they're more concerned with basic human needs like food, water, and money according to research.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:49.500
Some psychopaths may also believe in a higher power and be more spiritual, but it is more likely that they deem basic, primitive needs more important.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.400
Fact # 2: Psychopaths lack empathy

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.760
One of the biggest symptoms of a psychopath is that they have a lack of empathy.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.860
One interesting study, as reported by Science Daily, discovers that when psychopathic individuals imagine others in pain,

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.620
brain areas necessary for feeling empathy or concern for others fail to become active.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.340
Furthermore, when imagining others in pain, they showed an increased response in the ventral striatum,

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.640
an area that involves pleasure.  When imagining pain to themselves, however, psychopathic participants showed a typical neural response.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.900
Fact 3: Psychopaths are Malignment Narcissists

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.320
Nature Magazine published a fascinating article on the neuroscience of psycopaths based on a study done by a group of Dutch researchers.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.480
They found that psychopaths displayed malignment narcissism,  which explains psychopath's ability to manipulate any situation to their own advantage

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.480
with complete disregard for the suffering their behavior might cause others.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.160
Furthermore, some psychopaths are boastful and arrogant, and often criticize others.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.960
And this is simply a result of their grandiose sense of self-worth.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.840
Fact 4: Psychopaths are charming

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.140
Psychopaths are often amusing, entertaining, and witty.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.980
As Psychology Today reports, they're effective at presenting themselves, and they are extremely likeable and charming.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.700
The reason psychopaths are able to use their charm so powerfully is because they're able to get inside your head.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.260
This is rather simple for them, because they have zero distractions, and intense focus.

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.140
Therefore, they're able to create the illusion of the connection that you might feel.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.780
Fact 5: Psychopaths are pathological liars

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.340
Everybody lies, however, not everybody is a pathological liar.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.500
This is what mental health professionals call 'pseudologia fantastica". This is considered to be one of the elements of diagnosing psychopathy.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.900
According to mental health professionals, psychopaths not only lie about little things like what they had for dinner, but

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.840
they also lie about big things, like which college they attended.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.260
Researchers have claimed that psychopaths lie in order to control others by manipulating them.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.500
