00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.480
I’m Emad Khazaree, I am a fellow at Berkman
Klein Center for Internet and Society, and

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.309
I’m also an Assistant Professor of Information
at Kent State’s School of Information in

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:10.309
Ohio.

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:14.820
Broadly, speaking, I’m interested in how
human collectives use information technology

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.260
to achieve their collective goals.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.370
I look at two levels.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.000
At one level, I look at very large collectives,
how they use information technology for social

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.170
transformations, for example, how activists
use information technology to challenge authorities.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.500
On another level, I’m looking at very tightly
connected communities, I call them communities

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.440
of practice, how they use information technologies
to produce knowledge.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:42.120
At Berkman Klein Center, I am looking to understand
how we can theorize the dynamic of evolution

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.240
of the tools and methods that activists use
to challenge authorities.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:53.360
On a personal side, I’m Iranian and I have
seen a lot of transformations in recent years

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.910
happening in Iranian society.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.010
We’ve seen a very young population, educated
population, use information technology to

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.899
progress the state of society.

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:09.970
We are living in an era that the pace of technology,
changes and advancements, is so high, that

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.350
some people have become anxious about what
the impact of technology is in our society.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.950
It’s very important to see whether it helps
us to improve our society or not.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.420
I think that’s how it is important for the
average person, to see, in many contexts,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.229
such as oppressive environments, whether the
use of information technology can be a force

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.950
shifting the balance towards a more just and
progressive society, or it might give more

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.429
tools for oppressive governments to repress
and restrict humans’ freedom.
