00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.820
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
World History, and today we’re going to

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.720
talk about the Holy Roman Empire.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.640
Which as Voltaire famously pointed out, was
not holy, or Roman, or an empire.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.619
But the Holy Roman Empire can help us understand
world history, especially during the reign

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:19.610
of its most powerful emperor, the smart, and
sensible, and hard-working Charles Hapsburg,

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.620
known as Carlos I in Spain, and Charles V
in the rest of Europe.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:29.140
So, lets frame it this way. In soccer, the World
Cup is like a pretty big deal, especially for me.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.820
Mr Green? Mr Green? But I’m not even good at soccer

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.820
You’re actually not that bad Me From the Past, but the

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.120
only two things you put into your body are Wendy’s
and cigarette smoke. And that… it’s not

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.540
great for your athletic career.
In 2014, the final pitted Germany against

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.350
Argentina and if that game had been played
in 1550, both of those teams would’ve had

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.190
the same head of state.
The 2010 final between Spain and the Netherlands,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.160
again the same head of state - Charles V.
Unfortunately, the 1550 World Cup had to be

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.650
postponed until after soccer was invented.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.440
So, Charles V ruled one of the biggest empires
in history, behind only Chinggis Khan, Joseph

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.380
Stalin and Stalin’s successors in the Soviet
Union.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.250
In addition to claiming to rule most of Europe,
during Charles’ lifetime, (1500-1558), one

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.400
of his dominions, Spain, laid claim to nearly
all of the New World outside of Brazil. And

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.310
a few of his subjects -- the miserable survivors
of the fleet of Ferdinand Magellan -- became

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.510
the first known humans to circumnavigate the
globe.

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.360
Under Charles, the template for the colonization
of the Americas and the Christianization and

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.310
treatment of its indigenous people was laid
down, and Charles gave his seal of approval

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.270
to the Jesuit Order to convert Asia. He underwrote
the first Mission settlements to California,

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.670
and began the process of turning the islands
known as the Philippines into Asia’s largest

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.630
Spanish-speaking country.
But he wasn’t just a conqueror. Charles

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.110
also hosted the Valladolid debates, the first-known
discussions of universal human rights -- and

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.950
he actively sought to end slavery for many.
Although, not for all, and he didn’t really

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.659
succeed in ending it for anyone.
Yet, for all that, Charles V isn’t known

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.540
as a giant of world history. I mean his realm,
the Holy Roman Empire, was ultimately, a failed

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.960
state, and his reign a bitter disappointment,
even to himself.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.840
Trying to rule an empire stocked with rebellious
subjects including Martin Luther and with

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.480
territory in two hemispheres, Charles V managed
to totally bankrupt his realm and that was

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.670
kind of impressive.
Because he had access to the silver and gold

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.480
of the new world, the Renaissance banking
fortunes of Italy and the Netherlands, and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.470
the military power of Spain.
In short, Charles V was to the Holy Roman

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.569
Empire what Screech is to the Saved by the Bell alumni.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.849
By the time he died, crippled with gout and
malaria at the age of 58 - wait are we still

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.900
talking about Screech? No, apparently we’re
talking about Charles V now.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.780
Anyway, the Holy Roman Empire was defaulting
on massive debts to its creditors.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.739
So among historians, the debate over whether
Charles could have been a successful emperor

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.870
tends to break into two schools of thought.
One argues that the Holy Roman Empire was

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.700
doomed to fail largely because it lacked the
nationalism that powered the rising nation-states

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.900
like France and England.
But Voltaire was probably right, that the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.709
Holy Roman Empire was doomed from birth. Over
it’s 1004-year-history, the Holy Roman Empire

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:17.599
never had the means of levying direct taxes,
or directly raising an army from its territory,

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.390
which nearly always included what are today
Eastern France, Luxembourg, Germany, Austria,

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.700
the Italian peninsula, and Czechoslovakia,
and at times stretched to the Netherlands,

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.440
and Belgium, Hungary, Croatia, Poland, and
western Ukraine.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.120
Governing such a vast area is almost impossible,
especially when you have to have like you

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.260
know people on horses to deliver messages.
These days, even with the internet, governing

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.220
Europe isn’t that easy - Ask the European
Parliamentg how it’s going.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.670
So the HRE began in 800 CE as a marriage between
the Germanic warlord, Charlemagne, and the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.629
only sort of warlord-y Popes in Rome.
After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.760
western Christendom was basically a flock
of rural warriors who reveled in trials by

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.349
combat, Christian conversion through combat,
and, just generally combat.

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:06.920
And Charlemagne shrewdly recognized that the
Church’s mainly literate hierarchy and command

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.470
of tradition were his best possible instruments
for governing his battle loving feudal lords.

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.539
So Charlemagne and Pope Leo III struck a deal;
Leo would bestow upon Charlemagne the authority

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.800
and tradition of the Caesars, while Charlemagne
acknowledged the Church’s spiritual superiority

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.849
over his secular power.
And the name for the agreement reflected the

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:31.029
terms of the deal. Holy, because the Church
wanted top billing, Roman, to give Charlemagne

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:36.269
maximum prestige among his feudal subjects,
and Empire, because they wanted it to be an

00:04:36.269 --> 00:04:38.879
empire.
Here’s a lesson in romance from history:

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.740
marriages of convenience…. meh?
So the relationship between the popes and

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.029
the emperors grew a bit rocky over time. In
the centuries after Charlemagne, one European

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:52.569
warrior clan, the House of Hapsburg fought
to claim the Emperor’s throne, and to establish

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:56.119
dominance over the Papacy.
And one of the tactics used by the Hapsburgs

00:04:56.119 --> 00:05:01.289
was to promote dynastic marriages between
Hapsburg cousins, thus keeping inheritances

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.229
within the family and out of the hands of
the Church.

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:08.619
This Hapsburg in-breeding worked politically,
but, over centuries, it brought out recessive

00:05:08.619 --> 00:05:13.659
family genes for mental illness and -- most
famously -- these oversized lower jaws that

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:18.580
became Europe’s most-recognizable profile.
In short, in-breeding - great way to keep

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:24.270
money in the family, maybe not the best way
to keep A++ kings in the family.

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.550
The Papacy fought back and in 1356,the position
of Holy Roman Emperor was turned into an elected

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.460
position. Candidates for the crown henceforth
needed to win support from at least four of

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:36.419
seven “Electors.”
Now this didn’t prevent the Hapsburgs from

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.199
reclaiming the throne, but it did force the
family to pay fortunes in bribes and favors

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:46.159
to win it, because as always, money wins elections.
Charles was no exception and the bribes he

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.349
paid to secure the his position as Emperor
in 1521 meant that he started off his rule

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:54.069
in debt - which is never a great idea.
But wait, you say, now that he is Emperor

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:59.279
he can just tap into a loyal group of subjects,
who will be more than happy to pay tax increases

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.199
in order to pay off Charles’ debt.
But yeah, that’s not how the Holy Roman

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.439
Empire worked. All right, let’s get to know
this Emperor in the Thought Bubble

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:10.629
Charles’s parents came from two ambitious
dynasties. His mother, Juana, was the daughter

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.029
of Ferdinand and Isabella, whom you’ve probably
heard of. And from Juana, Charles laid claim

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:20.240
not only to Spain but to parts of Italy, including
Naples and Sicily, as well as what became

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.889
known as the Americas. Charles’s father
was the Duke of Burgundy, Phillip the Fair.

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.300
And through Philip, Charles could claim the German
lands of the Holy Roman Emperor, Maximilian

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.869
I, Phillip’s father.
So Charles’s existence was pretty much a

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:38.369
genetic engineering job designed to produce
a ruler of Spain and Germany. Only, Charles

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:43.599
was neither Spanish nor German himself. He
grew up in Belgium, in the dukedom of Burgundy,

00:06:43.599 --> 00:06:47.830
which technically made him a French subject.
And ruling over so many disparate people was

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:51.779
a recipe for trouble. Like, German peasants
in Frisia had revolted against the empire

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:57.169
in 1515, but they weren’t nearly as troublesome
as the Germans living in towns. By the time

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.740
Charles bought his throne in 1521, German
merchants had come to think of themselves

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:06.319
as being guaranteed the rights to speak in
a parliament, to have a say in their taxes

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:10.029
and even to form their own militias.
Protestantism was also a big headache for

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.580
Charles, especially when Luther and his followers
claimed that they followed their consciences

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.169
in matters of religion rather than the emperor’s
will. Charles thought that he solved this

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.839
problem when he faced Luther at the Diet of
Worms in 1523, but that didn’t work out

00:07:22.839 --> 00:07:25.499
quite as planned.
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, at the Diet of

00:07:25.499 --> 00:07:30.169
Worms Luther was so compelling when talking
about his faith that he became more popular

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.999
- not less.
And shortly thereafter he began his famous

00:07:32.999 --> 00:07:36.419
German translation of the Bible.
So obviously, governing most of Europe was

00:07:36.419 --> 00:07:42.379
just a tremendous difficulty for Charles V,
but he also had to be the ruler of all of

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:45.699
the Americas except for Brazil.
I can’t help but notice, Stan, that Brazil

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:47.959
is always the exception in the Americas.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:56.580
And with the Spanish Conquistadors subjugation

00:07:56.589 --> 00:08:01.849
of the the American Indians by the late 1530s,
Charles’s life got even worse or arguably

00:08:01.849 --> 00:08:04.399
better.
Because he was richer and had more subjects

00:08:04.399 --> 00:08:09.169
which is the point of being an emperor I guess.
So unlike most of the Spaniards in Spain’s

00:08:09.169 --> 00:08:12.929
colonies, Charles actually showed some concern
for his native subjects, but he couldn’t

00:08:12.929 --> 00:08:16.009
really do much.
Like in 1520, after receiving a steady stream

00:08:16.009 --> 00:08:19.869
of complaints about how the native people
were being abused, Charles banned the granting

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:23.789
of new encomiendas and ordered his officials
to phase out the old ones.

00:08:23.789 --> 00:08:28.520
And this worked … not at all. Hernan Cortes
and other leading conquistadors completely

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.159
ignored Charles orders and just kept doling
out encomiendas.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:36.229
And then Charles sent new orders saying that
the Indians are “to live in liberty, as

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:41.959
our vassals in Castile live...if you have
given any Indians in encomienda to any Christians

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.730
you will remove them.”
Cortes responded, “The majority of the Spaniards

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:48.870
who come here are of low quality, violent,
and vicious.”

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:54.579
Well, I guess he was self-aware. Anyway, his
response amounted to - we could only get Spanish

00:08:54.579 --> 00:08:58.159
people to come here if they have the right
to exploit other humans.

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.660
And then In 1526, Charles gave in and allowed
Cortes, and, later, Pizarro, to issue temporary

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:07.040
encomiendas to their men.
Now so far, Charles isn’t looking so good

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:10.990
in this story, so it might be useful to compare
his record to those of his contemporaries,

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.860
who, in theory, ruled more coherent and governable
states.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.500
And it just so happens that Charles reigned
at the same time as two of Europe’s most

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:24.280
notable proto-nationalistic leaders, England’s
Henry VIII and France’s Francis I of France.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.420
The bitterest rivalry was between Francis
and Charles, because Francis believed that

00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:33.120
Charles, as the Duke of Burgundy, which is
in France, was his subject.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.850
Charles, meanwhile, knew that Francis had
attempted to win the title of Holy Roman Emperor

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.920
himself, and had warned the electors that
Charles was an unfit and despotic man.

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.459
If we could just stop for a moment. Why on
earth would anyone fight to become the Holy

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:49.690
Roman Emperor.
The two monarchs fought four separate wars

00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:53.590
against each other. And according to proponents
of nationalism, Francis should have had the

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:58.120
advantage, right. Because he had unchallenged
power of taxation in France, and a religious

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:03.319
class that was loyal to him, and a population,
or at least an elite, that all spoke French.

00:10:03.319 --> 00:10:08.189
But Charles’s troops won every war. Not
only that, in the course of the wars Charles’

00:10:08.189 --> 00:10:14.889
troops managed to take Francis himself hostage
at the siege of Pavia, and sack Rome in 1527,

00:10:14.889 --> 00:10:19.160
ending the pope’s hope of becoming a real
player in secular politics, and, according

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:23.459
to some scholars, ending the Italian Renaissance.
Charles also fought a war against Suleiman

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:26.740
and the Ottomans, defeating them at Vienna,
although he wasn’t able to stop Suleiman

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:30.829
from consolidating his control over the formerly
Habsburg territory of Hungary.

00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:35.769
But despite ruling this fractious, polyglot
empire rather than a compact national state,

00:10:35.769 --> 00:10:39.459
Charles did okay for himself.
Well at least by some measures - by other

00:10:39.459 --> 00:10:42.839
measure he was a total failure. Oh, it’s
time for the open letter.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:46.680
But first, let’s see what’s in the globe
today. Oh, it’s all of my past romantic

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:51.050
relationships. An open letter to failure.
Dear failure, you’re so often in the eyes

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:55.430
of the beholder, like what looks like failure
at one point in your life can later look like

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.759
a wonderful success. I mean
Charles V had a lot of successes but ultimately

00:10:59.759 --> 00:11:04.529
he viewed his reign as a terrible failure.
That’s why he eventually abdicated and retired

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:08.350
to a life of full time beer-drinking.
And then he split up his empire with his brother

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:11.459
getting the Holy Roman Empire and his son
getting Spain.

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:15.750
And that was probably marginally at least
a good thing for both the Holy Roman Empire

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:19.519
and Spain.
In short, failure almost no person is merely

00:11:19.519 --> 00:11:23.649
a failure or even merely a success.
So enough with all these falsely constructed

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:28.740
dichotomies failure, they are complete failure.
Best wishes, John Green.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:32.879
So, the story of Charles V reminds us of something
we learn again and again when studying World

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:37.160
History: that there are multiple sides to
every piece of history.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:41.129
Yes, the Holy Roman Empire under Charles V
ceased to be Holy in the sense that it was

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:46.720
no longer 100% Catholic, it was never Roman
since Latin wasn’t among the many languages

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.730
spoken there…
And it wasn’t much of an empire because

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.879
it was too diverse and spread out for Charles
really to have the power of an emperor.

00:11:52.879 --> 00:11:57.399
But as with most history, and many facebook
relationship statuses, and one Meryl Streep

00:11:57.399 --> 00:12:01.319
movie - it’s complicated.
But perhaps the one concrete lesson we can

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:06.139
take away from the history of Charles V is
the benefits of acknowledging the limits of

00:12:06.139 --> 00:12:10.939
one’s power. Charles never did.
His imperial motto was plus ultra. And that

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:16.029
means “further beyond,” but it could also
mean limitless. Charles sought to fuse Atlantic

00:12:16.029 --> 00:12:20.839
and Central Europe into seamless whole on
a scale the size of today’s European Union.

00:12:20.839 --> 00:12:24.259
He tried to stamp out the Protestant Reformation
and make his response, the

00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.720
Catholic Counter-Reformation global.
He tried to create new policies in the New

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.149
World, while still defending old policies
in the Old World.

00:12:31.149 --> 00:12:35.019
And by trying to be the most powerful Emperor
in the most powerful empire in the history

00:12:35.019 --> 00:12:40.089
of the world he failed spectacularly.
There’s a lesson in that for all empires,

00:12:40.089 --> 00:12:44.600
and all nation-states, and even all people.
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.529
