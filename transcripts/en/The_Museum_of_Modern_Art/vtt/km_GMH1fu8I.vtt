00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:36.900
My name is Bruno Testore Schmidt and I was
one of the people who’d been there from the very first day.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.340
I lived around the corner.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.380
We used to meet all the friends there all
the time and do everything that we did.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.860
1979 or something?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.340
Yeah, '79 or '78.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.580
We’d go to SVA and I used to go right around
the corner and go there to visit.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.200
Hey, Fred.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.080
Hello!

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.390
Good to see you.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.540
Good to see you.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.339
It was the one place on Earth that was like
that at that moment.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:14.780
My name is Ellen Berkenblit and I had my first
painting show at Club 57 in 1983.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.760
Wait, Duncan, you want to fill in a little
bit?

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.920
What happened at Club 57?

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.600
Mayhem.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.320
Play-acting.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.400
"The Jetsons," that happened.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.200
We happened.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:38.720
Club 57 was a little kind of bubble of lunacy
in kind of a dark time, right?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.320
It was a dark time then.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.880
A lot of death, heroine, etc.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.200
But at Club 57 it was all "you can be whoever
you want to be," don't you think?

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.800
It was Halloween every night.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.760
Yeah.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.680
There was a time none of us went above 14th
Street, and now we're at fuckin' MoMA.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.720
I know, I know.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.160
You know, Club 57 was definitely unique in
that it was like the art crowd.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.360
Like, the Mudd Club was like the music crowd,
you know, and a little older.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.470
So every club had their, like, thing, but
Club 57...

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.370
Club 57 was a little goofy.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:27.930
Stanley was the Polish guy at the church who
hooked up Club 57 to be a youth group in a

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.459
basement of a Polish church and really advocate...and
people go like, "But it's really degenerates,

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.530
really crazy."

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.870
And he'd be like, "Well, our youth are more
troubled now.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.730
We have to be more understanding."

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.070
There's a certain synergy that comes when
you mix cultures.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.130
Like, jazz, blues and rock 'n roll came out
of Congo Square in New Orleans because that's

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.040
where cultures could mix.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.690
Club 57 is where everybody could mix and there
was no...you know what I mean, everybody came

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.940
from different backgrounds.

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.280
When you get 50 people together, if you create
the right environment and allow then to be

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:08.320
super creative in improvisation, they can
create unbelievable art.

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.160
My name is Fred Brathwaite.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.360
People know me as Fab 5 Freddy, and I make
paintings, I make culture, I disrupt, I shake

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.760
it up, and I exhibited at Club 57.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.520
So this is a work that I made during that
timeframe.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.240
The other piece on the other side, "Kneecap
Art Pimps" was a piece that actually showed

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.440
at Club 57.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.840
It was fun.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:30.720
It was a fun place.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.780
Anything goes.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.300
I was good friends with Keith Haring and that's
how I got to get familiar with Club 57, and

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.600
then became friends with, you know, Kenny
Scharf and Ann Magnuson and a bunch of the

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.420
core crew.

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:47.180
So I would be there often for different events.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.459
My name is Shawn McQuate.

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.260
I was also known as AMMO.

00:03:52.260 --> 00:04:01.940
And the first thing I did with Club 57 was
I was a go-go dancer for the Ladies Auxiliary

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.739
slumber party.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:12.290
I started doing fashion shows, and then I
did happenings there and I did performances

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.011
of dance and music there.

00:04:15.011 --> 00:04:21.239
And it was like you could just think up these
things and do them there.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.760
So this is the wire dress that I made for
Kitty.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.770
I wanted to use this cool wire, so I made
this dress with it.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.509
And then Kitty, who was just the best sport
in the world for art, wore it.

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.220
Oh, here she is!

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.720
And Shawn made this dress for me two years
ago.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:41.940
I was just talking about you.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.460
I know.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:43.000
I saw that.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.500
That wasn't planned.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.000
Trust me.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.500
I made this dress for her too.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.240
I was just walking by.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.240
That's amazing.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:50.900
Yeah, so this is Kitty, the best sport in
the world for art.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.860
Yes, I was his muse.

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.660
And Shawn was wonderful enough to make this
dress for me two years ago.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.180
It's an original.

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.330
It's all lace and there's no sewing.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:08.440
It's all paper fasteners and cleverness.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:20.460
I am Animal X. Animal as in "growl" and X
as in "marks the spot," and X, I use because

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.780
it's the best letter in the alphabet, you
know.

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.840
I got into the Club 57 crowd...basically I
predated it a little bit.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.940
I was at the School of Visual Arts with Kenny,
but I dropped out of it because I was too

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:34.940
busy partying.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:44.139
In fact, I think Keith never forgave me the
one time I was graffiti-ing in the SVA and

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.539
I was doing this text piece going all the
way down the wall, all the way down the stair,

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:52.240
all the way down the wall, right over what
he was graffiti-ing.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.939
And I just kept writing and writing, and then
I went upstairs and came all the way down

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:57.939
again.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.060
So after that we weren't best buds.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.960
But you don't think about those things.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.820
You know, you're just like, "I'm doing what
I'm doing.

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.880
You're doing what you're doing."

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:10.200
Well, you know, I went there but I don't remember
because I was on Quaaludes probably, you know

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.260
what I mean.

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.180
But I was more of a Mudd Club guy, I got to
admit, and I hated Studio 54.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:16.060
I was the only person.

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.879
Well, no, other people hated it.

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:18.879
Disco sucked.

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.160
I fuckin' hated Studio 54, but I did love
this place for their movies.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.400
That's what I remember, their movie series.

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.629
It's like a high school reunion from hell
or something.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:37.940
My name is Barry Schills and this is a video
that I made at Club 57 in around 1980, I think.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.820
Yes, 1980. But this was Lady Wrestling Night at Club 57.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:53.270
I was one of the fortunate people to have
a video camera back then, and I shot a lot

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.080
of the events there.

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.639
The one downstairs is "The Lawrence Welk Show"
where all the girls got dressed up and acted...

00:07:02.639 --> 00:07:04.939
you know, every night it was something different
there.

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:05.939
I love it.

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:10.099
It looks great, but I like garish colors.

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:17.610
So if anyone's listening, yank it up.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:21.259
So Club 57... Ann and I met in 1977 in London.

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:22.259
We were students.

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:23.259
I was witness to their meeting.

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:24.629
Before I met you, I met Ann.

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:26.340
But that was a significant year, '77.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.569
It was the beginning of punk.

00:07:28.569 --> 00:07:29.949
New York was very depressed.

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:30.969
I was a New York kid.

00:07:30.969 --> 00:07:32.509
I ended up coming back to New York.

00:07:32.509 --> 00:07:34.199
Ann was already here.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:39.400
She introduced me to the East Village scene,
CBGB's and Club 57.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.759
And she said, "Come and be in this show, 'New
Wave Vaudeville.'"

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:44.759
And I joined the show.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.080
I joined the circus, basically.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.129
And I dropped out of Columbia.

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.129
I was going to Columbia.

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:50.779
Remember, we were in a film class together.

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:51.800
It was Michael Oblowitz.

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.939
Well, I made some films.

00:07:52.939 --> 00:07:57.889
They're in the show, some films that he shot,
that he art directed.

00:07:57.889 --> 00:08:01.780
They're beautiful black and white footage
from '79, that's part of the show.

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.319
It was a rock video that we never finished
editing.

00:08:04.319 --> 00:08:06.430
We finally edited it.

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.610
It took 35 years, but it was worth it.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.779
I mean people drop names of Keith Haring and
Jean-Michel Basquiat but come on, Kenny Scharf

00:08:13.779 --> 00:08:15.190
is a god, an art god.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.460
Frank Holliday, and art god.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:24.199
Scott Covert, Ann Magnuson, I mean the list
goes on of incredibly interesting talent.

00:08:24.199 --> 00:08:26.759
Hi, I'm Daniel Durning.

00:08:26.759 --> 00:08:30.809
I created “Self Contained Housing.”

00:08:30.809 --> 00:08:38.030
This piece is a coat made out of fiberglass
insulation, thermal plastic, fiberglass window

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:42.680
screening with two-inch trim with venting.

00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:51.560
It's a very warm coat and it was made in response
to my dilemma of how do I heat the spaces

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.770
I was looking at, which were cavernous?

00:08:54.770 --> 00:09:00.250
In Brooklyn, loft spaces were available but
you couldn't afford to put up a wall if you

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.970
were a poor, broke artist, but you could get the space.

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:06.630
I almost fainted in it at Club 57.

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:12.340
So it's too hot and you should not drink while
wearing this coat, okay, that's all I can tell you.

00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:17.320
It was Pink Panther pink when I originally
created it.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.000
It looks like a meat coat now.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.780
The devil knows his meat.

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:28.300
My friend, Peter, who played in a band called
The Fleshtones were going to be opening this

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:29.300
club.

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.250
They were having a hard time finding places
to play, and they heard about this church

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.250
basement.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:39.350
So we go in and it really was like this uncanny
experience because you could feel it in the

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.150
air that there was something electric about
this room.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:47.390
And fast forward, you know, Ann Magnuson was
the next connection I had.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:52.580
And she basically had this calendar, and she
was looking to put people on the calendar,

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.210
and it just became these amazing…one night
after the next.

00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:00.740
I've been pouring through the catalogue and
there are so many different stories that are

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.240
associated with all these different events.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.050
Things are just being made up on the fly and
then they would make these incredible shows

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:09.310
out of them.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.310
“Wrestling Night.”

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:12.310
There's one in the book called "National Geographic."

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.310
I don't remember it.

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:16.920
I don't know what it was, but I'm sure there
was some kind of an amazing party that night.

00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:22.900
My name is Ann Magnuson and I was the second
manager of Club 57 and I'm the guest curator

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.860
of the exhibit here at MoMA.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.720
Well, I was in New York starting in early
'78.

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:31.780
I came here to be an intern, a directing intern,
at a theater uptown.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:38.200
And I met Tom Scully and he told me about
this "New Wave Vaudeville" show he wanted to do.

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.120
And I said, "Can I direct it?" and he said "Yes."

00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:51.840
and he introduced me to Susan Hannaford, and our various scenes comingled and the vaudeville
show happened.

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:59.480
And Stanley Strychacki saw it and invited
Tom, first, to come to the club and he told

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:06.640
us all about this small Club 57 at 57 Saint
Mark's Place, and then they offered me the

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.900
job of being the manager, Stanley, and the
rest is history.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:31.600
[music]
