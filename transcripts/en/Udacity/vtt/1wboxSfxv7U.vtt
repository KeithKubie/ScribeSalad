00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The answer is $80 per square foot, and we get this by just dividing $112,000 by 1400.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
It turns out that this data set has this amazing property that the cost per square foot is constant.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That allows us to interpolate the way we just did.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
In statistics that's often not the case, but I want to congratulate you.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You did your very first unit of statistics.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Congratulations. You completed Unit 1.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But as we go forward, we're going to look into data where the cost might not just be

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
a constant factor times the size of a home.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
See you in the next unit.
