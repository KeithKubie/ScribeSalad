00:00:24.365 --> 00:00:26.275
Rembrandt's painting, "The Night Watch"

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.960
perhaps the most famous work of his long career

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.840
and of the Dutch golden age generally

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.140
is not set at night,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.520
and it's not really a "watch" either.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.020
It's a painting of the militia company of district two under the command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.760
Which is also its true, long, original name.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:47.800
A century later

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.060
After years of varnish and low light darkened the canvas

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.240
Someone called it "The Night Watch," and it stuck.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.900
Because, well, that's what it looked like

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.520
In fact, "The Night Watch" was meant to be a day-time scene

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.020
Just like other portraits of the Dutch civic guards:

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.140
groups of well-to-do Amsterdam citizens

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.620
tasked with keeping the peace should threats come to the city walls.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.880
Over the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.380
civic guard portraits became a genre all it's own,

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.920
and as painting in the Netherlands moved away from

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.240
spiritual subject matter and towards the secular,

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.460
artists welcomed commission work from these wealthy guilds

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.220
because they wanted large group portraits again

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.020
and again

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.000
and again.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.595
But if you wanna know why Rembrandt's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.400
is the only civic guard painting that makes it into most school curriculums

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.840
all you have to do is look at it.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.460
Commissioned to do what all the others had done, show off the paying members of the guild,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.140
Rembrandt takes the genre

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.620
and explodes his vision through it.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.080
"The Night Watch" is an eruption of action, shadow, and light

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.100
with drama that's more suited to

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.280
a Biblical or historical epic,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.940
not seventeen guys from peacetime Amsterdam.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.760
No offense to Captain Cocq.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.920
So what makes "The Night Watch" so great?

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.880
Well, what hits me right away

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.520
is the balance that Rembrandt strikes between chaos and unity.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.500
He clearly wanted to create a canvas with a lot of movement,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:10.800
but the challenge was how to make that movement,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.295
people lurching in different directions, performing a variety of actions

00:02:14.295 --> 00:02:17.575
cohere into a unified whole.

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.555
The keystone, the part of the painting that holds everything in place,

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:23.595
are the dual figures of the captain and his lieutenant

00:02:23.755 --> 00:02:26.735
the rest of the portrait moves away from them diagonally

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:29.545
indeed, Rembrandt places these lines

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:32.335
directly onto the painting in the form of weapons and poles

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:35.375
and the effect isn't just two dimensional.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.195
Maybe the most striking thing is the captain and the lieutenant

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.305
seem to be

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.620
emerging from the picture plane,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.620
the captain's hand, ordering the company forward.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.420
It's as if you could grab it and pull him out of the frame.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.180
The lieutenant's partizan, the spear-like weapon he's holding in his left hand,

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.740
is so expertly foreshortened, it feels like it could cut you.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.880
In fact, based on the angle and the placement of the weapon's shadow on the ground,

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.340
the partizan is beyond the picture plane,

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.900
or at least it should be.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.040
Another trick Rembrandt uses to acheive this effect

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.560
is one that will be familiar to film makers.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.640
The figures in the front are painted with detail and clarity

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.420
while the further back you go in the composition, the softer and hazier things seem to get

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:18.975
Rembrandt is mimicking

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:21.615
“depth of field,” an optical phenomenon

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.000
that can make objects in focus pop from their backgrounds.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.155
All of these effects were carefully planned

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.720
by Rembrandt to anchor the composition

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.520
around the central figures.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.460
The longer you look at the night watch, the more meaning

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.020
emerges from this burst of frenetic energy.

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.900
For example, the three men with guns are performing

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.580
the three main actions associated with the Arquebus --

00:03:43.585 --> 00:03:46.485
the primary weapon of this particular guild.

00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:50.280
Loading, firing, and blowing clear the gun powder pan

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.560
In fact, these poses match almost perfectly

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.580
engravings from a book called “Exercise of Arms”

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.300
a famous manual on how to use weaponry

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.660
released at the beginning of that century.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.875
This particular civic guard, the Clauweniers, is signaled again

00:04:03.875 --> 00:04:06.815
in the chicken that’s hanging from the young girl’s waist,

00:04:06.815 --> 00:04:09.605
–  a similar claw was on the Clauweniers’s coat of arms.

00:04:09.605 --> 00:04:12.625
And while the captain’s hand points toward the viewer,

00:04:12.625 --> 00:04:15.645
its shadow points towards his company’s function.

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:18.735
It’s cradling the emblem of Amsterdam,

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:20.160
a Lion and three crosses.

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.320
The clauweniers were supposed to protect the city.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.820
The other notable feature is Rembrandt’s famous use of chiaroscuro.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.140
An effect of deeply contrasted light and shadow

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.875
It’s a technique that first came to prominence in the work of

00:04:33.875 --> 00:04:36.495
Carravaggio, who used sharp contrasts and harsh lighting

00:04:36.495 --> 00:04:39.805
to create intense drama in his paintings.

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:42.745
Rembrandt was clearly interested in this technique, but for him,

00:04:42.745 --> 00:04:45.600
light served a somewhat different purpose

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.040
Not only is Rembrandt’s chiaroscuro softer than Carravaggio’s

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.340
but the light in his paintings seems to have a numinous quality

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.180
As if, once it touches the subjects,

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.800
it becomes a part of them.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.560
If we turn back to “The Night Watch” we can see that Rembrandt uses chiaroscuro

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.080
to single out two key figures.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.560
The lieutenant and the girl.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.900
As we’ve already seen, both these figures contain symbols that call back to the group itself.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.935
In the case of the Lieutenant, it’s as if the captain’s orders to assemble

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:15.855
are illuminating his second in command

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.160
and from his light, the rest of the company is to fall in line.

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.560
And yet, compositionally,

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.775
the two lighted figures almost serve the opposite purpose.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.480
Instead of unifying the company, the girl and the lieutenant

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.960
seem strategically placed to break up the individual men in the canvas.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.840
Flanking the captain, they almost isolate him.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.300
And thanks to their contrast,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.100
we’re drawn to the haphazard actions and faces each man.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.840
All seeming to be lost in their own world.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.235
“The Night Watch” is capturing the moments before the company sets out

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.555
to its collective purpose.

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.720
But the painting almost makes us doubt that they’ll ever get there.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.680
Indeed, by the time this painting was made in 1642,

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.020
nearing the victorious end of the eighty years war with the Spanish,

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.075
the Dutch were prosperous

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.380
and civic guards were more ceremonial than necessary.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.880
At a certain point, these companies became clubs for men

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:12.680
to play with their weapons and chip in for fancy group portraits.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.745
It’s not inconceivable that Rembrandt may have been

00:06:15.745 --> 00:06:17.520
secretly making fun of them a little bit

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.040
in this, his most famous painting.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.280
But that’s the tension that the painter captures in "The Night Watch"

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.080
An endless jockeying between light and dark,

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.660
nation and individual,

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.660
chaos and order.

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.000
Rembrandt could never let either one of those elemental forces

00:06:33.005 --> 00:06:36.015
win out in his composition because if he did,

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.560
he’d lose the most essential thing.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.220
The thing he was striving for and achieves

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.600
with an effect that makes this one of the greatest paintings

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.960
of all time

00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:47.505
Motion.
