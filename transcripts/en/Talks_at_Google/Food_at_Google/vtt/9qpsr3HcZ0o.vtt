ANNIE: I'm excited
to have with us

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.336
today Darra Goldstein,
the Adsit Professor

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:09.210
of Russian at Williams
College and the founding

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.480
editor of the James
Beard award winning

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.300
food journal, "Gastronomica."

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.422
Darra is a prolific
writer and consultant

00:00:17.422 --> 00:00:19.640
on culinary and cultural topics.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.900
She has done everything,
from organizing

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.310
a historical
exhibition of tablewear

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.336
at the Cooper Hewitt
Smithsonian Design Museum

00:00:27.336 --> 00:00:31.270
to serving as a national
spokesperson for Stolichnaya

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.940
Vodka when it first came
to the United States.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.115
Best of all, Darra
is also my aunt.

00:00:37.115 --> 00:00:39.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.015
She is the author of five
well-known cookbooks,

00:00:42.015 --> 00:00:46.130
and is here today to discuss her
latest, "Fire and Ice-- Classic

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.800
Nordic Cooking," just
released by Ten Speed Press.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.550
I'm pleased to welcome Darra
Goldstein to Google today.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.031 --> 00:00:59.780
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: Thank
you so much, Annie.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.170
And Annie's husband
Jacob is here, my nephew.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.980
So this is a really
meaningful place for me to be.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.010
Because I feel very-- I
mean I know all of you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.630
always feel connected,
but I feel connected

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050
in a very personal way.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.130
So thank you for having me.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.260
I want to talk to you--
I don't know how many of

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.882
you have traveled
throughout Scandinavia

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:24.190
or are familiar with it.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.030
But it's a place it's been
very close to my heart

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.680
for a long time.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.780
Way back in college I
was studying Russian

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.490
and I wanted to go
to the Soviet Union--

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.270
obviously-- to become a
better Russian speaker.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.250
But that was back in
the Cold War days,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.680
long before you were born.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.700
But I guess we're back
into the new Cold War

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.610
now, so I shouldn't
make it so historical.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.080
But it was impossible
for me to get a visa.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.380
So I thought, where
can I possibly go

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.240
where I could perhaps
go in as a tourist

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.000
and still experience
Soviet life?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:06.020
So I decided to go to
Helsinki because it

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.650
is a cold, dark,
northerly place,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.500
and I could easily
get across the border

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.830
to what was then Leningrad.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.530
And I studied at the
University of Helsinki

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.170
and it just opened my eyes to
so many things-- and importantly

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.090
for this book, to
so many flavors.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.450
Fast forward eight years.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.540
I was newly married,
once again wanting

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.270
to go to the Soviet Union.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:33.410
I mean, something might
have been wrong with me.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.210
But it was a place that
was very compelling.

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.440
I was studying right up
the road here at Stanford.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.360
And my husband and I
had given up everything

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.680
and decided to get married so
that we could go to the Soviet

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.200
Union together.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.670
And we gave up our teaching
assistantships, our apartment,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.170
and applied for the visas.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.120
That was 1980.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.160
And the Soviets
invaded Afghanistan,

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.220
the US pulled out
of the Olympics,

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.560
and my visa with the last
name of Goldstein was revoked.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.780
And his last name is
Crawford-- he got a visa,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.820
but he's not a Russianist.

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.820
So once again we're in this
position of what do we do.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.940
So I thought, has to be another
cold, dark place not too far

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.170
from Soviet Union.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.910
So we went to Stockholm and
spent the year in Stockholm.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.480
And again, that was
just eye opening.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.000
It was really wonderful.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.570
And I realized that I was in
love with the Nordic countries.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.670
So if you look at
this map, you can

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.810
see that it stretches
really from Denmark up

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.890
to-- it's cut off at
the top because I'm

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.020
presenting to everyone.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.850
So you can't really
see the full length.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.190
But it's about 2,000
kilometers from south to north.

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:00.200
The climate here is fairly
mild in northerly terms.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.450
And down here in Sweden,
this area-- Smaland--

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.830
is considered the
Tuscany of Sweden,

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:11.020
because the temperature is
so temperate, shall we say.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:14.130
But the part that intrigues me
is up here at the far north,

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.140
up above the Arctic Circle.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.790
And here-- that's
cut off a bit--

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:21.970
is the Barents Sea,
which is shared

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.160
by both Russia and Norway.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.110
Norway goes all the way up.

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.840
And if you look at
these countries,

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.280
you can see that what
really defines them all

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.390
is very long coastlines.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.160
When I was thinking about
this book, and so many years

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.320
of having traveled
to this region,

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.600
I thought of what
interests me most.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.740
And it's this idea of a northern
dimension, a northern way

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.220
of thinking that really
has nothing to do

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.260
with political boundaries.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.750
It has to do with how
people have survived

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.890
over the centuries
in what is largely

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.500
a very inhospitable climate.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.200
So I wanted to look at
the whole sweep of foods

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.520
and the way of thinking.

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.300
Now one of the
interesting things

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.310
about studying
this region is you

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.790
find all sorts of quirky
things that have happened.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.890
For instance, up here you can't
quite see the border of Norway

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.750
with Russia is right there.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.040
But in the 1960s the
Soviet scientists

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.500
decided that they wanted to
put the Kamchatka crab-- which

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.870
is like a huge king crab.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.180
I mean if its claws are
extended it's really

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.760
much taller than I am, actually,
if you were to put it on end.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.940
And they decided to put
it into the Barents Sea,

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.050
because it is from the
Far East, because they

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.770
wanted to start farming it.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.900
And that very smart
crab in the 1960s

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.240
wanted to escape
from the Soviet Union

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.120
and crossed the
waters into Norway,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.310
where it found very
rich, fertile feeding

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.450
grounds in the
Barents Sea and became

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.630
a real ecological problem that
they're still contending with.

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.820
Conversely, in
Finland this area--

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.670
you can see Finland
has many, many lakes,

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.420
and here's the
border with Russia,

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.340
somewhat artificial
border I might add--

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.730
but there's a very
wonderful fish

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:28.610
called the vendance, which
is a little bit like a smelt,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.030
called [FINNISH] in Finnish.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:36.840
And that fish in Finnish they
refer to as the wise old man

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.890
of the lake.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.055
Because even though it's very
close to Lake Ladoga and there

00:06:41.055 --> 00:06:45.130
are connections, it never
crosses the border into Russia.

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:47.290
It stays in Finland.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.070
Anyway, so this
gives you a sense

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:52.190
of the topography of the place.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.700
So I was thinking about
what to call this book.

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.485
And I decided I wanted
to do "Fire and Ice,"

00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:00.770
because to me those are
really the two poles of what

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:03.050
the Nordic countries are about.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:07.120
And my publishers at Ten
Speed-- who are just up the road

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.760
and across the Bay in
Emeryville-- loved the title,

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.670
but thought, well, is that going
to compete too much with "Song

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.300
of Ice and Fire"-- you
know, "Game of Thrones"?

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.820
You have to have
something you can Google,

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.640
and it'll come right
up, and everyone's

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:23.080
going to be finding
"Game of Thrones."

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:31.210
But they luckily were very in
the end amenable to this topic

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.980
and came up with this quite
beautiful cover, I think.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.700
If you hold it up
to the light, you'll

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.830
see that it is very shimmery
and iridescent, which to me

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:46.360
captures that quality of light
that you find in the far north

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.730
and the iridescence of ice.

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:53.920
So when I talk about these
two poles of fire and ice,

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.900
the dish that comes
most to mind is

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.150
a dish from the Sami, who
are also known as Laplanders.

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.430
They live in the far
north of Norway, Sweden

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:06.190
and also Finland.

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:08.730
And historically
they were nomads.

00:08:08.730 --> 00:08:13.170
And like many people
in modern life,

00:08:13.170 --> 00:08:14.770
they're much more settled.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.330
But they're still allowed
to herd their reindeer.

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:19.970
And in the winter
time they would

00:08:19.970 --> 00:08:21.700
take chunks of the
reindeer meat--

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.430
because reindeer was
a very important means

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:30.200
of economic life,
but also nourishment

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.950
for them-- and they would
take the reindeer meat,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:37.740
bury it in the snow, and then
take a very sharp hunting knife

00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:41.200
and shave it off in
quite thin slivers.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.950
And you can see the
snow all around here.

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:46.940
And then they
would light a fire.

00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.340
And these crystalline pieces
of shaved reindeer that

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:54.940
still had the ice on them
would go into a skillet

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:57.320
and then it would steam,
because the water would

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.590
evaporate as it was cooking.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.670
I tried so hard to get reindeer
as I was testing this book,

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:06.600
because this is one of my
absolute favorite dishes

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.730
in the world.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:09.940
I couldn't find a
source of reindeer.

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.210
We happen to have
a lot of venison,

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.250
so my version is with venison.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.580
But it's something you can--
if you have a strong husband, I

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.610
would say, who has a
hunting knife-- it's

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.820
very easy to do at home.

00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:27.870
But this fire and ice
theme continues also

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.640
in the beverages that are found
in the northern countries.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.120
The one on the left is glog,
which you find particularly

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.970
in Sweden and also in Denmark.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:43.490
And basically it's
a mulled wine.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:46.470
And if you think about this
climate and how dark it gets.

00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:50.120
So when I was living
in Finland, the sun

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.250
would sort of come
up around 10:00

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:55.290
in the morning at the
darkest part of the year

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:58.920
and sort of set at 3 o'clock.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:00.440
So you had five hours.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.640
But it was only
quasi-daylight, you know.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.670
It wasn't this California sun
that is bright and a blue sky.

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:08.730
Everything was sort of gray.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.790
And so one of the things
that the Scandinavians do

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:14.470
is to bring light
into their lives

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.640
and have things like
this golden mulled wine

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:20.850
with all kinds of spices
I'll talk about in a minute.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:26.840
The ice counterpart to that
is aquavit, or schnapps,

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.150
which is basically a distilled
alcohol generally made

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:33.355
from grain.

00:10:33.355 --> 00:10:36.870
But it's usually flavored
with dill-- aquavit

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:40.250
generally with caraway is
the most classic flavor

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.965
I made some with tiny new
birch leaves that I had picked

00:10:43.965 --> 00:10:47.940
that give it a very bitter taste
that the Scandinavians tend

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:48.500
to love.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.530
Or around Christmas
time I really

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.740
like to use cardamom and ginger
for these warming flavors.

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.260
So here you see
there's rosemary,

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:01.110
which surprisingly grows quite
well in the very long summers.

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:03.400
But you can flavor
it with everything.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.840
And I won't go into
my Stoli girl spiel

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.110
about all the different
flavors you can make,

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.240
but it's a lot of
fun to experiment.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.170
But it's served ice cold.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:18.550
This is a photograph from a
village called Longyearbyen

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:25.670
in the Svalbard archipelago,
which is up about halfway

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.530
between the northern tip of
Norway and the North Pole.

00:11:29.530 --> 00:11:32.600
So it is really far north.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.550
And I love this photograph
because for me it

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:39.520
captures this whole idea
of the fire and the ice.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.620
When it's dark but when
there's ice on the ground,

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.600
there's a kind of glow.

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.100
And in the homes
there are candles,

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:49.150
there's this beautiful light.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:52.820
And it's a way of bringing
warmth into your environment

00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:56.280
when the external environment
is not so friendly.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.870
There's a beautiful word
in Danish called [DANISH].

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:03.700
And it doesn't really
translate into English,

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:05.580
but it's something like comfort.

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:08.470
And it's not the kind
of comfort if you

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.610
get under your comforter
in bed all by yourself,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.490
it's the kind of comfort
where there's camaraderie,

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:17.810
and you have some glog, and
you're drinking together

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:19.180
and sharing things.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:24.140
And actually the old Norse
root of [DANISH] and hug

00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:24.940
are the same.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.760
So you can see where
that comes from.

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:30.450
So I don't know if you
find this kind of landscape

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:34.680
as beautiful as I do, but
this Svalbard archipelago is

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:38.080
actually a very important
place because it is home

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.890
to the Global Seed Bank, which
is also known as the doomsday

00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:49.200
vault. And it was conceived in
2006, finally finished in 2008.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.710
And the seeds from
all over the world

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:57.740
are deposited there as
a guard for biodiversity

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:02.270
in case there are crop failures,
or-- as is happening now

00:13:02.270 --> 00:13:05.440
in Syria-- a
terrible war raging.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:07.540
And when the seed
bank in Syria had

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:10.960
to move from Aleppo
to Beirut, they

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.930
had to leave a lot of
their seeds behind.

00:13:13.930 --> 00:13:18.780
So they had deposited seeds
in this doomsday vault.

00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:22.540
And each country is only
allowed to get its own seeds--

00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:25.010
so it you can't take
other people's seeds

00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:26.590
and start planting them.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.000
But they were able
to retrieve some.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.680
This building was built,
again, to capture that light.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.640
It has stainless steel,
mirrored surfaces,

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.750
these wonderful reflections.

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.030
And if you can also think
of the Northern Lights,

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:42.990
you get a bit of a sense of
that in that greenishness there.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.130
It's really gorgeous.

00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:47.980
The seeds are kept at
minus 18 degrees Celsius.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.140
And they believe that
they'll remain viable

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.950
for a good 200 years.

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:57.800
So now to move more
specifically to food.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.270
Probably the two most common
Swedish loan words in English

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.160
are dynamite--
which was introduced

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.410
by Alfred Nobel,
and of course Nobel

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.840
is a very familiar name
to us, particularly

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:15.850
this time of year--
and smorgasbord.

00:14:15.850 --> 00:14:20.310
So this is a very classic
Swedish smorgasbord.

00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:22.470
And where does it come from?

00:14:22.470 --> 00:14:25.010
Well, in the past,
particularly I'm

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.360
talking around the
16th century, it

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.560
was called a
brannvinsbord, which

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:33.040
is really more like a schnapps
or aquavit table, that

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.590
focused mainly on the alcohol.

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:39.030
And gradually more and
more food was introduced

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:44.800
until by the 19th century, and
then particularly in the 1960s

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.450
there was a very famous
restaurateur in Stockholm

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:50.840
who institutionalized
this smorgasbord

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:53.070
as we tend to know it today.

00:14:53.070 --> 00:14:56.770
The name itself
is a compound noun

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.820
that comes from three
different words--

00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:04.440
smor, which means butter, gas,
which means goose, and bord,

00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.030
which means table.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:11.550
The smorgas was actually a term
that came from churning butter.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:14.650
I don't know if any if you have
ever churned butter by hand.

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:16.820
You've probably
inadvertently made butter

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:18.800
if you've whipped
cream for too long,

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.580
and suddenly you have butter.

00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:23.940
But you're churning and churning
and these clumps of butter

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.950
start forming on the surface.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:28.810
And they looked a bit
like dancing geese.

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:31.510
So those became
this smorgas, which

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:36.560
became itself a metonym,
a metonymy for sandwich.

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:41.180
And then the sandwich table
became the smorgasbord.

00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:43.120
Now in Sweden what
you do with that

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:45.640
is you have five
different, they call them,

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:48.040
tours-- you take
five different tours,

00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.210
it's five different helpings.

00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:55.710
And first, always first, is
his majesty, the herring.

00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:59.140
And the first round
of filling your plate

00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.990
is always many
different kinds of

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:05.960
herring in all different forms--
pickled, creamed, smoked,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.780
chalked, all beautiful things.

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:12.070
Then comes the servings
of different kinds

00:16:12.070 --> 00:16:13.830
of fish and shellfish.

00:16:13.830 --> 00:16:15.490
Because remember,
as I mentioned,

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:18.420
there's a lot of coastline, so
fish is a very important part

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:19.670
of the diet.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:23.040
Next come the cold
meat and salads.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.960
And then the hot dishes.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:27.400
So you might think
Swedish meatballs,

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:34.240
or stuffed cabbage leaves,
or all kinds of veal dishes.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.680
And then the final
one, of course,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.930
has to be this sweet one.

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.610
And with all of them
you have schnapps,

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.610
because that's a very important
part of the experience.

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:46.840
So we have this beautiful
institution of smorgasbord,

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.240
which is a very Swedish thing.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:51.830
And it came into
the United States

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:57.390
in 1939 at the New York World's
Fair in the Swedish pavilion

00:16:57.390 --> 00:17:00.160
and became all the rage.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.859
Unfortunately, it has devolved
into the all-you-can-eat

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:06.240
buffet.

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.730
There's this great map
of the United States

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:10.930
that I like to show
my students that

00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:14.069
shows all of the states and
their distinctive foods.

00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:18.849
And Utah-- oh, no, sorry,
sorry, Utah-- Nevada,

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:23.545
you know where Las Vegas
is, has a chafing dish from

00:17:23.545 --> 00:17:26.400
the all-you-can-eat
buffets there.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.650
But its translation is even
stranger in Japanese culture.

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:36.240
The word smorgasbord
doesn't lend itself easily

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.190
to pronunciation in Japanese.

00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:45.090
So what happened in 1958 at
the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:51.990
is that the owner saw the 1958
film "The Vikings" with Kirk

00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:55.450
Douglas-- it was narrated
by Orson Welles--

00:17:55.450 --> 00:17:58.830
and was totally enthralled
with these Vikings.

00:17:58.830 --> 00:18:02.570
And so he decided
to call the buffet

00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:06.160
that they were presenting
Viking, [JAPANESE]

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.260
and that has become the
word for buffet in Japanese.

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.674
This is a modern ad for--
I can't read the Japanese,

00:18:13.674 --> 00:18:15.090
I don't know if
anyone in the room

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:19.486
can-- but it's for
the Japanese buffet.

00:18:19.486 --> 00:18:22.090
But let's get back to the food.

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:25.700
So thinking again about
this very cold climate,

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:30.580
the only grains that
thrived there were barley,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:35.080
and spelt-- to some
degree-- and oats.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:40.490
And then a little bit later
on rye came in from Russia.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:43.580
But wheat really was not
grown because the climate

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:44.520
was too cold.

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:47.780
And it didn't enter too
much into the cuisine

00:18:47.780 --> 00:18:51.415
until the late 19th century
when it was already being milled

00:18:51.415 --> 00:18:54.100
and it was affordable
in the form of flour.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.890
And that's when there
was this explosion

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:59.950
of wonderful baked goods
that we can talk about if you

00:18:59.950 --> 00:19:01.790
have questions at the end.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.940
But most of the
breads are still based

00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.810
primarily on rye, but also
to some degree barley flour

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:10.520
and also oats.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:15.250
So they're very, very wholesome,
very hardy, whole grain.

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:18.760
They also eat all of
these things as porridge.

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.570
Finland in particular has the
most extraordinarily diverse

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.010
array of breads that I've
encountered anywhere.

00:19:25.010 --> 00:19:27.690
There's still probably
something like 100

00:19:27.690 --> 00:19:29.970
that are being
commercially produced.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.240
And if you draw a line
down the middle of Finland,

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:36.270
basically you encounter
the two traditions.

00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:40.640
To the east, which
is towards Russia,

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:45.320
you find these breads like
this one-- big sourdough

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:49.550
loaves that have been
baked in masonry ovens.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:56.130
They're very thick,
and savory, and chewy.

00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:59.640
In the western part is
Finland, unbelievably, they

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.750
bake their breads only
once or twice a year.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.550
They didn't have as much fuel
and so wood was very expensive

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:08.160
for the ovens.

00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.300
And what they did was make
these thinner loaves--

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:12.750
they were much flatter.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.420
And they had holes in the
center, as you see here.

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.380
And they would put them on
poles that would be hung up

00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.540
in the rafters of the house.

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.710
And it would dry and
become a kind of hardtack.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:26.160
Sometimes it became
so hard that then you

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.910
had to shave it again with
that handy hunting knife,

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:33.260
or soak it, or put it in soup.

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:38.180
So the people mostly like
the standard yeasted loaf

00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:39.620
that we know today.

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.820
But there's also an
amazing tradition

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:43.710
throughout all of
the Nordic countries

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:45.980
for the flatbreads,
the crispbreads which

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.480
are really crackers.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.580
And one of my favorite
recipes in the book,

00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:52.540
which I think is just
awesome because I've never

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.650
really encountered a
recipe like it before,

00:20:55.650 --> 00:20:59.135
is you take some
preservative-free rye bread

00:20:59.135 --> 00:21:03.960
or multigrain bread and you soak
it overnight in beer or ale.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.970
And then in the morning
you squeeze it out--

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:07.530
so you just have this paste.

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:10.640
Add a tiny bit of soft
butter and spread it really

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.130
thin on some parchment paper.

00:21:14.130 --> 00:21:17.130
Bake it, and you have this
extraordinarily healthy

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.060
cracker.

00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:21.390
And you can change the
flavor all the time,

00:21:21.390 --> 00:21:25.320
depending which bread you use.

00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:29.530
We tend to think of the
far north as just barren.

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:32.970
I don't know if any of you know
Gary Paul Nabhan's writings,

00:21:32.970 --> 00:21:35.000
but he's written
a beautiful book

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.660
about the desert, which we also
think of as a barren place.

00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:41.900
But the Native Americans
who lived there

00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:44.070
knew how to eat from the desert.

00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:46.700
And the people who
lived in the far north

00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.110
knew how to eat from the
land and from the sea.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:56.230
And one of the incredible riches
from the north is mushrooms.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.060
We tend to think of foraging
as a very chic activity.

00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:01.675
And we go out and
we collect mushrooms

00:22:01.675 --> 00:22:05.274
and we feel good about
ourselves-- as we should.

00:22:05.274 --> 00:22:07.180
And we commune with nature.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:11.570
But there it's something
that is built into the genes.

00:22:11.570 --> 00:22:15.010
It is something that is
absolutely necessary.

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.590
So here we have
some black trumpets.

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:21.730
The most favorite mushroom I
would say is the chantrelle.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:23.870
And they're just golden.

00:22:23.870 --> 00:22:26.370
I mean it's like finding
gold in the words.

00:22:26.370 --> 00:22:29.520
And they're so very beautiful.

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:33.770
And people go out
and they won't really

00:22:33.770 --> 00:22:36.160
tell where their
mushroom spots are

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.440
because they want to be able to
return to them over and over.

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.280
The other thing that the
northern words provide

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:47.880
are things that we don't
really use so much-- juniper

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:50.810
berries-- which
grow, I mean juniper

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.960
grows in northern California.

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:55.840
Fir trees and spruce trees grow.

00:22:55.840 --> 00:23:01.070
And everything, again
this whole conversation

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:04.290
we have about eating
locally, eating seasonally,

00:23:04.290 --> 00:23:08.520
it really is the way of life for
people in the Nordic countries,

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.820
because it's how they survived.

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.970
So in the spring you
can go out and get

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:15.660
these very beautiful
young shoots

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.620
of the fir or the spruce trees.

00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:21.410
You don't want them to mature
too much because then they'll

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:22.600
get really too strong.

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.170
But they have this
beautiful resonous--

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.500
If you think about retsina,
the Greek wine, if any of you

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:31.640
like that sort of piney
flavor, that's what you get.

00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.670
And you can mix it with butter.

00:23:33.670 --> 00:23:35.750
You can infuse oil with it.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:38.810
If you're making gravlax,
which I'll get to shortly,

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.340
you can add it up with
the dill to layer it

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:44.990
and it adds this
wonderful flavor.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:49.060
How many of you know
juniper berries intimately?

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:50.360
OK, good.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.980
So you dry these berries
and they add-- I don't know,

00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:56.680
to me it's just the
taste of the wild.

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:59.820
You again can pound them
in a mortar and pestle

00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.430
or you can use the food
processor is OK too.

00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:06.750
But I really like to get that
aroma coming up from the pestle

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:11.260
right there and not
have it enclosed.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.580
You can add that to butter,
put it on some rye bread,

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.290
and it's just amazing.

00:24:16.290 --> 00:24:17.610
Add it to stews.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.280
There's a wonderful
recipe for an apple soup

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:24.480
that your guests will have no
idea what you're serving them.

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.530
They won't be able
to detect what it is,

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:29.630
but it's basically pureed
apples with some apple

00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.160
cider and some juniper berries.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.990
It's really quick and beautiful,
but it has this wild element.

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:40.540
But I think what Scandinavia's
perhaps most renowned

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:42.490
for are the berries.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.540
And we have all of the berries
that we're familiar with here,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:51.380
but also some really
distinctive very special ones.

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.230
On the left you
have cloudberries,

00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:56.150
which are very fleeting.

00:24:56.150 --> 00:25:01.610
They ripen in the end of
August and they grow in bogs.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:04.620
And what you'll see,
if you're driving

00:25:04.620 --> 00:25:09.580
on the roads in the northern
part of Finland, Sweden,

00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:11.430
and Norway-- they
don't really grow

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.470
in Denmark-- is people
in full-- they're

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.730
like beekeepers, because
they're covered head-to-toe.

00:25:18.730 --> 00:25:20.280
But they're
protecting themselves

00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.600
against the mosquitoes
which are really vicious.

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.780
But the foragers
want the cloudberries

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:29.000
so much that it's worth it.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.040
And they have this
wonderfully musky flavor.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:37.260
And they also have a lot
of vitamin A, vitamin C,

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.320
surprisingly a lot of iron--
which you don't usually

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.860
think of with berries--
and omega 3 and 6 fats.

00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.700
So they're sort of a super food.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.160
And they're made into jam.

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.440
And also Finland makes
a really nice liqueur.

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.780
But on the right you
see sea buckthorn,

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:59.350
which grows more to the
south on the coastline.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.080
I like to think of the
sea buckthorn as the Linus

00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:07.530
Pauling of berries because
it has so much vitamin C.

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:14.950
And in Russia I know they're
using it as a cancer drug--

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.240
the jury's still out
how effective it is.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.620
But it's very, very tart--
it's really puckery.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:24.600
And it's made into a
juice and also into a jam.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.440
So the number of
berries in Finland alone

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:30.190
that are edible, there
are something like 50.

00:26:30.190 --> 00:26:32.500
So I think you see
familiar ones here

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:38.300
like raspberries, green
and pink gooseberries.

00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:41.290
There are red currents here.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:44.290
And up at the top, the red
ones are rowan berries.

00:26:44.290 --> 00:26:50.630
And you can see lingonberries,
bilberries, and blueberries.

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:53.540
My favorite is lingonberry.

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.880
The lingonberry
grows in Canada, it

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:57.460
doesn't grow in
the United States.

00:26:57.460 --> 00:27:00.750
If you go to IKEA you
can get it in a jar.

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:02.280
And it's still quite wonderful.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.810
But the amazing
thing about them is

00:27:04.810 --> 00:27:08.650
that they have
natural benzoic acid,

00:27:08.650 --> 00:27:12.690
so much that you don't have
to cook them to make a jam.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:14.890
You just stir them with
sugar-- because you really

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:17.640
do need sugar, they're
very, very tart.

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:21.870
And I'm starting to salivate as
I think about their tartness,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:22.810
just that puckeriness.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:27.810
But you just stir them with
the sugar and they don't spoil.

00:27:27.810 --> 00:27:30.290
So in the middle of
winter you open up

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.460
this jar of lingonberries
and you feel

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.780
like the summer has come again.

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:40.570
And it gets you through
that long, dark season.

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:43.790
But I want to get
back to the Vikings.

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:47.950
So here's Kirk Douglas
in 1958 in "The Vikings".

00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:49.950
And I think the only
reason he doesn't

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:52.620
have a beard is because
he has that cleft chin

00:27:52.620 --> 00:27:55.120
and he always had
to show that off.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.770
He does have that glass eye
that is just totally weird.

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:03.600
But you also have the
guys from the current hit

00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.440
series, "The Vikings,"
who are very bearded.

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.000
And I'm looking around the
room here-- I do see one beard.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.722
Did you just move
here from Brooklyn?

00:28:11.722 --> 00:28:12.221
No?

00:28:12.221 --> 00:28:12.720
OK.

00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.570
So you go to Brooklyn and
everyone is fermenting food,

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:20.670
and everyone-- oh no, I
see two beards, oh wow.

00:28:20.670 --> 00:28:22.150
Did you just move here?

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:22.710
No?

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:23.820
OK.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.690
All right.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.100
And all the men have
these Viking style beards.

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.110
The reason I'm bringing
it up is simply

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:37.570
because the Vikings did live
in this part of the world.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:39.720
But there is this
company in Iceland

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:44.710
that is making all kinds
of products for beards

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.370
that they advertise
by saying we're

00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:51.750
tapping into more than 1,000
years of beard-caring tradition

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:55.980
from a culture that grows beards
that had to handle the frost,

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:59.960
snow, wind, dirt, and sea
that comes with living in some

00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:04.140
of the most demanding
places nature has to offer.

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:09.070
We do this so you and your
beard can stand strong

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:12.610
in the face of nature
and proudly say, show me

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:15.540
what you've got, I can take it.

00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:19.220
Now what does this have to do
with a cookbook on Nordic food?

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.510
Well, if you delve
into their website

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:24.380
you find that all
of their products

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.030
are absolutely
natural, and they're

00:29:27.030 --> 00:29:31.260
the foods that are still being
eaten in the Nordic lands

00:29:31.260 --> 00:29:32.700
today.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.660
So juniper berries--
which I mentioned.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:40.630
Bog myrtle, which is
also known as sweet gale.

00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:46.420
And its leaves are
somewhat resinous.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:52.410
But it was also used to replace
hops and used to make ale.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.080
Dill, which is the most
iconic of the herbs

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.340
in Scandinavian cooking, comes
from the word to comfort.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.420
One of my favorite-- it's
all about comfort for me.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.450
Yarrow, rosemary,
grapeseed oil--

00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:07.830
which is none other than
canola oil, which is actually

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:10.671
a GMO product.

00:30:10.671 --> 00:30:11.170
Pine.

00:30:11.170 --> 00:30:15.060
And then down at the
bottom there's beeswax.

00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:18.690
So these Vikings
were very important.

00:30:18.690 --> 00:30:22.490
We tend to think of them as
predators and plunderers, which

00:30:22.490 --> 00:30:23.910
I guess they were.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:27.380
We also tend to think of
them as having traveled

00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:32.930
west towards England, and the
Faroe, and Ireland, and then

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.890
on to Vinland,
Newfoundland, and Canada.

00:30:36.890 --> 00:30:40.100
But what most of us
don't really think about

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.530
is that they also
went south and east.

00:30:42.530 --> 00:30:45.970
And you can see that they
went as far as the Black

00:30:45.970 --> 00:30:48.390
Sea and also the Caspian.

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:51.250
And what happened there,
particularly in Constantinople,

00:30:51.250 --> 00:30:54.430
is they connected with the
great trade routes, the Silk

00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:59.060
Road, and all of these spices
coming in from the east.

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.980
And they brought them
back to Scandinavia.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:07.160
So if you think on the
one hand about the bog

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.350
myrtle, and the juniper, and
the spruce growing there,

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:14.070
you also have these
extraordinary spices

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:17.230
that came in fairly early.

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:19.880
And the Scandinavians--
particularly

00:31:19.880 --> 00:31:21.860
the Swedes and the
Danes-- adopted

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:27.830
them and they became
the basis for baking

00:31:27.830 --> 00:31:31.090
and also for some savory
foods like the glog--

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.980
these are glog spices
that you see here.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.770
So you have ginger,
you have cardamom--

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:39.180
which is the single
most important,

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.590
along with cinnamon the two
single most important spices

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:44.500
used in baking.

00:31:44.500 --> 00:31:48.260
There's also nutmeg,
cloves, star anise.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:54.660
And the vanilla came later, the
oranges came somewhat later.

00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:57.080
But they're all really,
really important

00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:02.390
to the aroma of
the Nordic cooking.

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.300
And at Christmas time
in every Nordic country

00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.860
you have some form
of gingerbread,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:15.680
known as pepperkakor, or
in its various iterations,

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:17.260
gingerbread cookies.

00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:22.460
So we think of
gingerbread men and women,

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.610
but in Europe they actually
made the gingerbread

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:27.980
in the form of animals.

00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:31.240
And there is a reason for
this anthropomorphism.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.650
If you think about living
in cold, dark, scary places

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.100
that have impenetrable
pine forests.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:41.710
And there are bears,
and elk, and wolves,

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:46.050
and all of these creatures that
really are a bit terrifying

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.520
if they're not Disneyfied.

00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:53.600
If you eat those
creatures, symbolically you

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:56.570
diminish their power
in a certain way,

00:32:56.570 --> 00:32:59.040
because you are ingesting them.

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.690
But you also take on some of
the attributes of strength.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:06.520
So these are modern
gingerbread cookies.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.430
So that's why you see
the Moomintrolls, which

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:11.060
are a 20th century phenomenon.

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:13.390
Tove Jansson, who's
a Finnish writer

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:16.590
and does stories about
these cute trolls,

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:19.620
the kitty cat isn't
really too terrifying

00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:22.080
unless you have a
cat like I once did.

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:27.240
But the gingerbread is a
very important part of it.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.860
So it's not just
foods from the Earth,

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:33.840
it's also these spices that
came in, including saffron.

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:38.630
And one of the most
important foods in Sweden

00:33:38.630 --> 00:33:43.690
are the Lucia buns, which
are baked every December 13.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.842
December 13 used
to be the longest

00:33:46.842 --> 00:33:48.300
night of the year,
the shortest day

00:33:48.300 --> 00:33:51.530
of the year, the darkest moment
when all of the evil spirits

00:33:51.530 --> 00:33:52.750
would come out.

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:57.650
And they were named
after Santa Lucia, who

00:33:57.650 --> 00:34:00.290
gave up her eyes
because she didn't

00:34:00.290 --> 00:34:04.070
want to marry this suitor,
and she was martyred.

00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:08.030
But it's also related to the
term for light-- also related

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.090
to Lucifer.

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:12.310
So you have the dark forces
and the light forces.

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.690
But when you add
the saffron, you

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:18.530
have these luminous buns on
the darkest day of the year.

00:34:18.530 --> 00:34:20.890
And they're very delicious.

00:34:20.890 --> 00:34:22.889
So I talked about the Vikings.

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:24.850
And the other people
who were living there

00:34:24.850 --> 00:34:26.900
were the Sami, whom
I've also mentioned,

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:29.199
the reindeer herders.

00:34:29.199 --> 00:34:34.500
And the Europeans who
were living in Scandinavia

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.070
were intrigued by the Sami
because they were so different.

00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:40.989
They spoke a different
language, they looked different,

00:34:40.989 --> 00:34:42.670
they lived differently.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:49.570
And in 1673 a scholar at
Uppsala University in Sweden

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:54.370
wrote a book about Lapland--
Laponia-- Johannes Schefferus.

00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:58.330
And you can see that he
talks about the region.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:01.690
And he says on the
origin, superstitions,

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:06.420
and sacred magic of this
Sami-- or the Laplanders.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.540
The reason I wanted
to show you this cover

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:12.850
is because of the importance
of this idea of superstition

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.590
and sacred magic.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.040
Well into the 18th century
when you had Linnaeus-- Carl

00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:23.600
Linnaeus-- who is the
father of taxonomy

00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:29.120
and the binomial system
of naming things,

00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.560
well he was aware of all of
the dark magic around him.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.980
And one of his missions was
to try to overcome that.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:42.340
He said, without science,
demons of the forest

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.990
would hide in every
bush, specters

00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:46.850
would haunt every dark corner.

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:50.480
Imps, gnomes, river spirits,
and the others in Lucifer's gang

00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.110
would live among
us like gray cats.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:56.000
And superstition,
witchcraft, and black magic

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.900
would swarm around
us like mosquitoes.

00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:02.340
And of course everyone's
familiar with mosquitoes there.

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.020
And so his great
grandmother was actually

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:08.230
burned at the stake as a witch.

00:36:08.230 --> 00:36:11.460
So I think he felt
it very deeply.

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.640
But he went to the
north of Sweden

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:15.770
and found that the
people were so poor

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:19.340
that they were pulling the
bark off trees and eating that.

00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:23.300
And he was very distressed,
not just at the poverty,

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.000
but because the trees were
important to the economy.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.850
And so he advocated
that they eat

00:36:29.850 --> 00:36:37.100
bog myrtle, nettles, and lichen
in place of the bark of trees.

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.135
And here you can see the nettle.

00:36:39.135 --> 00:36:43.820
Nettle is very much like
spinach, rich in vitamin A,

00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:48.710
and vitamin C. And
here you can see

00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:55.450
that it has the Linnaean
name Urtica dioica l,

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:58.572
the l standing for Linnaeus.

00:36:58.572 --> 00:37:02.060
And you can gather these.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.070
They sting, so you
have to wear gloves.

00:37:04.070 --> 00:37:07.040
But once you cook them, you
can make beautiful soups.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.030
They also dried it and
baked it into bread.

00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.430
So it was very nourishing.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:16.060
The lichen that he advocated,
the reindeer lichen, I think

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:19.750
is somewhat less delicious
than nettle, which is

00:37:19.750 --> 00:37:23.320
a really beautiful herbal food.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.250
I had this lichen dish at
Noma, the Noma which is soon

00:37:27.250 --> 00:37:29.530
to be no more in
Copenhagen. But it's

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:34.750
where all of the new
Nordic revolution began.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:38.550
Rene Redzepi, the chef,
is quite brilliant in what

00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:40.620
he has done with the
foods that people

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:42.570
have been eating forever.

00:37:42.570 --> 00:37:44.740
They are actually very
traditional foods,

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:48.250
but he recreates
them in new ways.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:50.860
And what you have here
is reindeer lichen that

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:54.450
has been flash fried for
I think no more than about

00:37:54.450 --> 00:37:58.450
five seconds, because you don't
want it to absorb any oil.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.750
You just want it to
get a little bit crisp.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:05.040
And then he's taken mushrooms--
the porcini-- dried them,

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.750
and then powdered it.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.910
And then of course
his presentation

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:12.470
is always gorgeous, serving
it on a bed of moss.

00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:15.670
So the Sami would eat
the reindeer lichen

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:18.150
that they would
harvest for free.

00:38:18.150 --> 00:38:21.480
At Noma you pay quite a bit
more for that little dish

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:24.440
of reindeer lichen.

00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:27.060
The other thing that's very
important in the Nordic

00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.940
countries is dairying.

00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:33.330
And what I found extraordinary
in doing my research

00:38:33.330 --> 00:38:36.420
is that 90% percent of
the Swedish population

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:38.620
is lactose tolerant.

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:45.180
It's kind of unheard of,
because most humans are actually

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:50.060
able to imbibe mother's milk
but then lactose intolerance

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:51.750
grows as we age.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.010
And many people
in the population

00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:55.720
just can't digest it.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.840
But the Swedes do, and
it's pretty amazing.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.160
And so there's a whole
tradition of dairying.

00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:06.460
On the upper right you see my
favorite cheese from Sweden--

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.310
it's called vasterbotten.

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:10.350
And you lucky people
in the Bay Area

00:39:10.350 --> 00:39:14.430
can go right up to Nordic
House on San Pablo in Berkeley

00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:15.650
and they sell it.

00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:17.560
And I urge all of
you to taste it.

00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.070
It's a very sharp, almost
Parmesan-like cheese

00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.775
and it's really beautiful.

00:39:21.775 --> 00:39:24.250
Beneath it you
find it's sort of--

00:39:24.250 --> 00:39:25.844
AUDIENCE: Sorry,
you said what place?

00:39:25.844 --> 00:39:26.344
Nordic--

00:39:26.344 --> 00:39:30.100
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: Oh,
Nordic House on San Pablo.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:31.890
And they also have
the salted herring.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.580
And they, I hope,
will carry my book.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:35.970
Are you working on that, Erin?

00:39:35.970 --> 00:39:36.540
ERIN: I'm working on it.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:37.623
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: Good, OK.

00:39:37.623 --> 00:39:39.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:39.930 --> 00:39:43.210
Its polar opposite
is beneath it.

00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:48.580
It's called brunost or
gjetost and it's Norwegian.

00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:51.660
And it's made from the
whey of goat's milk

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:54.550
usually that is mixed
with milk or cream

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:59.060
and then boiled down until it's
caramelized and really soft.

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.620
It's almost like fudge.

00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:02.630
And it becomes very sweet.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:05.630
And you take a cheese
plane and you shave it

00:40:05.630 --> 00:40:08.510
and you put it on a
cracker like that.

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:11.520
And it's the Norwegian
national cheese.

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.830
And people absolutely love it.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.500
I tend to like the
firm cheeses that

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.600
have a more piquant flavor.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.140
But a cheese I
discovered in researching

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:24.060
this book-- which is now
one of my new favorites--

00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.500
is the other one.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:30.160
And that's known as bread
cheese or squeaky cheese.

00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:33.420
It's called bread cheese because
the curds are formed into loaf,

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.930
they're pressed, and then
they're baked in the oven.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:39.740
And you can see that
little bit of caramelized,

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.130
that maillard reaction that
causes those nice brown spots.

00:40:44.130 --> 00:40:47.540
Called squeaky cheese because,
like some other cheeses

00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:49.850
you've had-- sometimes
mozzarella when you chew it

00:40:49.850 --> 00:40:52.430
you get a sort of
squeaking sensation.

00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:54.340
But the fascinating
thing is that

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:58.320
in the far north of Sweden--
well, starting in Finland,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.800
Sweden, and Norway--
one way that they

00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:06.360
eat it is by dropping it into
a cup, pouring coffee over it--

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.930
as you see here.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:11.790
And you drink the coffee and
it doesn't taste like cheese,

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:13.430
believe me.

00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:18.220
But I don't know how well the
globules of fat show up there,

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.430
but it gives it a kind
of body as milk does.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:24.880
We put milk in coffee, so
why not put cheese in coffee?

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.860
I mean really what's
the difference?

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.520
But then you finish the cup
of coffee and at the bottom

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:32.800
is this wonderful cheese that
actually has a slight coffee

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.830
flavor.

00:41:33.830 --> 00:41:37.150
And it's a really
cool thing to do.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.590
So in Sweden they
talk about SOS.

00:41:40.590 --> 00:41:44.450
For us it's like, help, and
in Sweden it's also help.

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.860
It's help, I need
something to eat.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.110
And what do I need?

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:51.072
I need the smor, which
is-- do you remember?

00:41:51.072 --> 00:41:51.780
AUDIENCE: Butter.

00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.430
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: Butter, yes.

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:55.840
Ost, which is the cheese.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.370
And sill, which is the herring.

00:41:59.370 --> 00:42:04.400
But of course my friends say
it's not the butter, cheese,

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:07.010
and herring, it's the
other word that starts

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:09.240
with s, which is the schnapps.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:13.660
So you can understand
SOS in many ways,

00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:17.990
but you have to eat quickly, and
preferably with the schnapps.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:20.430
And the schnapps,
which is the aquavit,

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.640
is so important to
Swedish culture--

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.832
but also to other cultures--
that way back in 1922

00:42:26.832 --> 00:42:31.080
when there was threat
of prohibition there was

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.940
a campaign against prohibition.

00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.810
So this poster by
Alfred Engstrom

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.120
is not saying no
to alcohol-- which

00:42:41.120 --> 00:42:45.810
is what you would think looking
at it-- it's saying no to "no

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:50.897
to alcohol" because
crayfish need this drink.

00:42:50.897 --> 00:42:52.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.230
So what's that all about?

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.780
Well, crayfish are an
institution, particularly

00:42:57.780 --> 00:42:59.760
in Finland and Sweden.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:03.250
And every year-- and it used
to be an exact day, it's

00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:06.820
just that has changed
now-- but the end of July,

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.520
beginning of August
is crayfish season.

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:13.080
And when you eat crayfish
you have to have schnapps.

00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:16.440
You can have beer
too, but the crayfish

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:20.510
would die without the schnapps
to accompany them, basically.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:24.030
And unfortunately
they were overfished,

00:43:24.030 --> 00:43:26.210
as happens all over the world.

00:43:26.210 --> 00:43:31.450
And in the early 20th
century they got a fungus.

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.650
And so many of the
crayfish disappeared.

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:38.240
In the 1960s they started
importing crayfish

00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:41.170
from the United States,
the signal crayfish,

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:45.200
and it also became
infected with this fungus.

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:48.100
And so now the noble
crayfish, as they call it,

00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:51.760
is very expensive, but still
the preferred one to eat.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.140
And there are wonderful
crayfish parties every August.

00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.040
But if you're talking
about an entry food,

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:01.980
like it's a gateway
food, into Scandinavia

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:04.635
it would be gravlax,
which I'm sure all of you

00:44:04.635 --> 00:44:06.870
have tasted-- it's cured salmon.

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:10.550
And it comes from a
very ancient method.

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:14.170
The word is an
abbreviation of gravid lox,

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:16.190
which means buried salmon.

00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:17.880
And the fishermen
would go fishing

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.610
and then they would take the
salmon and bury it in the sand

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.740
until they had finished
all of their expedition.

00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:26.740
And so it started
to ferment slightly.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.500
Now we don't bury
it in the sand,

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:33.222
we just rub it with a mixture
of sugar and salt and pepper.

00:44:33.222 --> 00:44:34.680
You can flavor it
with elderflower,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:40.180
you can flavored it
with juniper, or fennel,

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:41.950
or whatever you want.

00:44:41.950 --> 00:44:44.260
Put some dill between
it and leave it for two

00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.040
to three days in
the refrigerator

00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:48.270
and it's really,
really beautiful.

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:52.010
But all of these Nordic foods
are based on preservation

00:44:52.010 --> 00:44:54.530
and trying to get
through the winter.

00:44:54.530 --> 00:44:57.000
Here you see the
gravlax with crispbread,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.550
which again is a way
of preserving bread

00:44:59.550 --> 00:45:02.900
because it's a cracker, it's
dry, it will last forever.

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:08.140
And a beet tartar, which granted
is a much more modern iteration

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.700
of cooked beets.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.950
But they are very sweet, they
have a lot of sugar in them.

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:19.270
But they're mixed with
gerkins or dill pickles

00:45:19.270 --> 00:45:20.570
and some vinegar.

00:45:20.570 --> 00:45:23.340
So they have a sweet
and sour flavor,

00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:27.240
which is one of the
hallmarks of Nordic taste,

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.880
particularly in Denmark
and the south of Sweden.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.240
Surstromming, which
is fermentation

00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.530
taken to what some would
consider an Anthony Bourdain

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:45.340
level, so herring that has
been allowed to ferment--

00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:48.240
and some people
would say go bad.

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:52.090
The smell is-- have any of
you ever experienced it?

00:45:52.090 --> 00:45:53.590
It's extremely strong.

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:55.910
It's actually been
banned by the EU

00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:59.720
on airlines unless the
flight originates in Sweden.

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.300
If you look at the
top picture, you

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.200
see that the can is bulging.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.880
I mean I was brought up never to
buy a bulging can because it'll

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.610
be botulism.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:10.880
But this is desirable.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.320
Salt was not very prevalent
in the Nordic lands--

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.590
it was very expensive.

00:46:16.590 --> 00:46:19.280
So what they did to
preserve the herring--

00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:23.050
and this is Baltic herring,
was to put it in a very lightly

00:46:23.050 --> 00:46:26.180
salted brine instead
of a strong salt.

00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:31.110
And then it would ferment
and really began to rot

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:32.910
by many people's terms.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.640
And then it's put into a can
where it continues to ferment.

00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.815
And then in August, just
like with the crayfish season

00:46:39.815 --> 00:46:42.180
it's the surstromming season.

00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:47.660
You open it outdoors
underwater and either you

00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.220
like it or you do not.

00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:51.950
But they do this.

00:46:51.950 --> 00:46:54.410
In Norway they have rokke fisk.

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:58.260
In Iceland they have hakarl,
which is the fermented shark.

00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.320
So one of the things
I love to think about

00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:04.910
is just the difference
between what is fresh

00:47:04.910 --> 00:47:06.390
and what is preserved.

00:47:06.390 --> 00:47:11.610
So Magnus Nilsson came here
and spoke at Google in 2012.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:16.840
And I captured this slide
from his YouTube video, Food

00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.470
at Google, when he was
talking about his restaurant

00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:23.510
Faviken and the seasons.

00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.470
And it's really very telling.

00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:29.140
Because you can see that
the season for fresh foods

00:47:29.140 --> 00:47:33.570
is so fleeting for the garden,
for the cultivated foods.

00:47:33.570 --> 00:47:35.430
The vegetables
are extraordinary,

00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:38.930
because of course you
have 24 hours of daylight

00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:41.410
in much of the north.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.680
And so they get
this intense flavor

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:46.860
that, even though I have
summertime in Massachusetts,

00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:49.570
which I actually do
have, but we don't

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.200
have 24 hours of daylight.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.510
Our vegetables never
get this flavorsome.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:59.110
But look how much is
foraged-- so usually

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:03.200
in late spring and late summer
to early fall-- and then

00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:07.010
the green line and how much
is stored and preserved.

00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:09.680
So it's really, really
important to think

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.240
not just about
preserving these things

00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.130
but also the
transformation of flavor.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:19.050
So you start by doing something
to survive, but then the flavor

00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:24.260
become something different,
and intense, and very beautiful

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.890
to me.

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:29.910
When we think of pickles,
we think of vinegar.

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:32.430
In Scandinavia more
often they're brined.

00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:37.550
So they're put, again, in a
salt solution, which gives them

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:38.930
not a vinegary flavor.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.050
You get the more
essential flavor

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:45.280
of the cucumbers, especially
when you add the dill.

00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.470
They also make pickles
using vinegar--

00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:50.200
these are pickled beets.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:55.050
In Sweden the vinegar
ranges from 12% to 24%.

00:48:55.050 --> 00:48:56.890
In the United States
it's generally

00:48:56.890 --> 00:49:02.703
5% of the acetic acid.

00:49:02.703 --> 00:49:05.490
And sometimes you can get 7%.

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:10.380
The 24% stuff is also used
as a cleaning product.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:12.610
And it's not legal
in the United States.

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.910
I tried so hard to find it
because I wanted to make

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:17.450
the authentic pickled beets.

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:18.640
I could not find it.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:21.210
But their general
proportion-- it's

00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:22.710
called the one,
two, three solution.

00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.050
So it's one part vinegar,
two parts sugar--

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:28.180
so you get the sweet
and sour thing going--

00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:30.180
and then three parts water.

00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.910
And that I had to adjust,
because our vinegar is not

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:34.380
nearly as strong.

00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:36.510
And of course pickled
herring, which

00:49:36.510 --> 00:49:39.200
starts with the
salted herring that

00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.890
has already been preserved.

00:49:40.890 --> 00:49:43.970
And then the salt is
rinsed off and you put it

00:49:43.970 --> 00:49:47.720
into a sweet and sour
vinegar solution.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:50.800
There's another important
method of preservation

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:54.590
that I haven't mentioned
yet, and that's drying,

00:49:54.590 --> 00:49:57.720
which is practiced
mainly in Norway.

00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:02.070
And cod was so important for
the whole economy of Norway

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:04.050
until they discovered oil.

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:08.590
And Norway, which was
once the most poor country

00:50:08.590 --> 00:50:10.890
in Scandinavia, is
now the wealthiest--

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.260
so the tables have been turned.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:16.680
But they take this skrei,
which live in the Barents Sea.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.430
They live there for
five years and then

00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:23.410
they come down the west coast
to spawn in the Lofoten Islands.

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:25.660
And they're hung
in the air to dry.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:29.320
So you have the salt air from
the sea that dries them--

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.860
you don't have to
add additional salt.

00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:33.820
And it became
known as stockfish,

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:36.860
but they also have others
that they dry on the rocks.

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.160
And this was the lifeblood,
this was the essence

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:43.380
of the fishing culture.

00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.930
By now it has largely died out.

00:50:45.930 --> 00:50:49.700
And you see these same racks
that are standing empty.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.360
And they have built
roads out to the islands.

00:50:52.360 --> 00:50:55.490
And now it's a vacation
site, and people come

00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:58.260
and they gaze at them,
and it's really beautiful.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.160
And the fish themselves
are endangered,

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.340
because Russian and
Norway signed a treaty

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.815
about the Barents
Sea, and now it

00:51:04.815 --> 00:51:09.180
will be open to exploration
for oil and natural gas.

00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.720
And it's the world's last
large stock of wild cod,

00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.800
so it is a cause for concern.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:21.680
I wanted to show you the
final method of preservation,

00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.140
and that of course is smoking.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.280
So all of these things
transform flavors-- they

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.050
add another layer of flavor.

00:51:30.050 --> 00:51:35.390
And even though it's
all very chic now,

00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:38.260
it goes back to survival.

00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:42.220
And so returning to this
theme of fire and ice,

00:51:42.220 --> 00:51:46.890
I think of the Sami huts,
which you can visit as tourists

00:51:46.890 --> 00:51:50.450
if you go to the north
of Sweden or to Finland

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:52.070
It's called a kota.

00:51:52.070 --> 00:51:54.200
And here you have this hut.

00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:56.070
And in the center
you have the hearth,

00:51:56.070 --> 00:51:59.660
and the smoke goes out
the central chimney.

00:51:59.660 --> 00:52:02.530
And you can see the
salmon on a plank

00:52:02.530 --> 00:52:08.590
that is being cooked by the
indirect flames from the fire.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:11.030
You find that in the
Pacific Northwest,

00:52:11.030 --> 00:52:13.970
the plank salmon that the
Native Americans did--

00:52:13.970 --> 00:52:15.970
they put them on cedar planks.

00:52:15.970 --> 00:52:19.260
In Finland this is known
as fire-glow salmon.

00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:20.760
And it's really beautiful.

00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.300
It's very succulent and moist.

00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:27.720
But the thing that I also
think about with this slide

00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:33.660
is the word focus, which is
the Latin word for hearth.

00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:38.680
So the hearth, the center of
the home, really is the focus.

00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:43.570
And fire is all about warmth,
and cooking, and conviviality.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:46.890
And to me, ice is too.

00:52:46.890 --> 00:52:49.780
Because you can have a
bar with the schnapps--

00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:54.620
this is the ultimate icebreaker
in the north of Sweden

00:52:54.620 --> 00:52:56.700
right on the Russian border.

00:52:56.700 --> 00:53:01.820
And so ice can be warming too,
and this wonderful antidote

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.160
to the darkness.

00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:04.660
Thank you.

00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:08.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:08.090 --> 00:53:10.090
And now if you
have any questions,

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:11.680
I don't know if
there's any time.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:15.160
Oh, yeah, there are a few
minutes left for questions.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:17.860
I'm happy to answer any.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:19.820
AUDIENCE: So much of
the Nordic cooking

00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.530
seems to be about place,
and a representation

00:53:22.530 --> 00:53:25.800
of the environment, and what's
right there in their backyard.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.880
And I think you touched
on this a little bit.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:29.640
But can you talk
about what it was

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.430
like developing recipes and
maybe some of the challenges

00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:35.320
that you ran into creating
that sense of place

00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.680
in an American kitchen?

00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:38.180
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: I
was very pleased.

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:42.340
It was quite easy
living in Massachusetts,

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.160
which is a northerly place.

00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.610
But I think that for the
most part all of the recipes

00:53:47.610 --> 00:53:49.200
can be created anywhere.

00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:51.910
Because the only ingredients
that were difficult to find

00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:58.220
were fresh herring-- which runs
only in June in the East Coast.

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:00.010
Here you have yours coming up.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.110
There's amazing herring
in the San Francisco Bay,

00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:06.260
and you'll be able to get it if
you can find a fishmonger who

00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:07.360
will sell it to you.

00:54:07.360 --> 00:54:09.950
And it's an extraordinary fish.

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:11.510
Most of the Herring
in this country

00:54:11.510 --> 00:54:15.030
goes to Japan for sushi,
where they appreciate it--

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:18.760
or is ground into cat food,
because cats appreciate it too.

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:21.280
But it's an amazing fish.

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.700
Whitefish is also eaten a lot.

00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:26.970
We have great whitefish
in the Great Lakes.

00:54:26.970 --> 00:54:30.860
And again, it's not a fish that
people tend to think about.

00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:36.160
And Swedish anchovies, which
you can buy up the road-- or you

00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.260
can even buy them on Amazon.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:42.050
They're not the same as the
salted Italian anchovies.

00:54:42.050 --> 00:54:46.450
They are sprats
that have been cured

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:51.700
in a sweet and sour brine with
some sandalwood and spices.

00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.640
And they're added
to wonderful dishes

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:58.160
like Jansson's temptation, which
is basically creamed potatoes

00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:02.640
with these fish that
just melt in-- oh, I'm

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.500
starting to salivate
again-- these fish that

00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:05.530
just melt into it.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:07.180
It's really wonderful.

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:10.030
So I found it-- as opposed
to the Georgian cookbook

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:12.410
that I wrote-- when I
moved to the Berkshires

00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:14.610
I couldn't even find cilantro.

00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:16.380
That was way back
in the dark ages.

00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:20.010
But I would have to travel for
an hour to buy some cilantro.

00:55:20.010 --> 00:55:24.030
These ingredients are for
the most part familiar to us.

00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:25.950
The fresh mushrooms
you can either

00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:29.970
forage or you have
the Ferry Market

00:55:29.970 --> 00:55:33.700
here that I'm envious
of, or the Berkeley Bowl,

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:37.090
or any of these places that
have lots of mushrooms.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:40.990
Lingonberries, cloudberries,
you can't get them fresh.

00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:42.660
AUDIENCE: How did
you decide which

00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:45.110
recipes to put in the book?

00:55:45.110 --> 00:55:47.180
DARRA GOLDSTEIN: I wanted
some that were iconic.

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:50.320
So obviously gravlax
had to be in there.

00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:56.530
I didn't put lutefisk in,
which is the dried cod that

00:55:56.530 --> 00:56:00.050
is treated with lye
and then reconstituted

00:56:00.050 --> 00:56:04.260
that Garrison Keillor has
made so many jokes about.

00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:08.450
So I decided to put in
ones that I enjoy eating,

00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:11.380
but also some that
people might know about

00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:13.910
and that really
did speak of place.

00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:16.590
One of the more unusual
ones in the book

00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:20.010
is one of the first foods
I tasted in Finland.

00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:24.240
It's called vispipuuro, which
simply means whipped pudding.

00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:27.760
And what you do is
you take faina-- which

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.140
is basically cream of wheat.

00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.090
But not the instant
stuff-- it has

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:33.740
to be the so-called slow
cooking, which I think

00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:34.700
is only 10 minutes.

00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:37.240
But for Americans
that's impossible.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.890
But don't try it with instant.

00:56:38.890 --> 00:56:44.285
And you just cook the
farina with cranberry juice.

00:56:44.285 --> 00:56:45.910
There they would use
lingonberry juice,

00:56:45.910 --> 00:56:48.550
but here I substitute
cranberry juice.

00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:51.240
It turns this
beautiful garnet color.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:54.700
And then you put it into
the mixer and you whip it.

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.800
And it's this gorgeous pudding.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.700
And no one knows what's
in it, because who

00:56:58.700 --> 00:57:02.860
would think of eating
a cold cream of wheat

00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:05.110
lurid pink pudding?

00:57:05.110 --> 00:57:06.680
And it's absolutely delicious.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:10.450
It's an after-school treat for
children, it's very nourishing.

00:57:10.450 --> 00:57:12.115
So I wanted that to be in there.

00:57:12.115 --> 00:57:15.910
They use a lot of almond
paste, which I adore.

00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:17.800
So that was a reflection of me.

00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:24.320
So there's a beautiful wreath
of a rich brioche-like bread

00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.590
that has almond paste in it.

00:57:26.590 --> 00:57:29.640
They grind up almonds
and make meringue layers

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.590
and then spread strawberries
and whipped cream

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:34.010
during the summer.

00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:37.360
There are a lot of soups,
because soup is slow

00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.590
cooked and nourishing.

00:57:39.590 --> 00:57:40.640
I could go on and on.

00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:44.390
So much of it I reflected
me, my own taste,

00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:46.930
what I thought Americans
would be interested in,

00:57:46.930 --> 00:57:50.320
but also trying to get somewhat
of a balance between these four

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:51.430
countries.

00:57:51.430 --> 00:57:56.740
And I didn't add them up,
because I'm not a the Google

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:57.640
person.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:00.860
So I didn't look at
them quantitatively.

00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:04.430
But in general I think
it's pretty well-balanced.

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:07.750
OK, well thank you
so much for coming.

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:10.800
[APPLAUSE]
