00:00:00.226 --> 00:00:01.631
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.631 --> 00:00:04.312
is get some practice estimating adding

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:06.798
and subtracting three digit numbers

00:00:06.798 --> 00:00:09.798
and so here it says 398 plus 251 is,

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:13.451
and this squiggly equal sign means

00:00:13.451 --> 00:00:15.082
we just need to make an estimate.

00:00:15.082 --> 00:00:18.026
We wanna know what is
this roughly equal to?

00:00:18.026 --> 00:00:19.963
So normally I say pause the video

00:00:19.963 --> 00:00:21.905
but here I want you to
work it out in your head.

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:23.173
So I'm just gonna pause.

00:00:23.173 --> 00:00:25.424
I'm just gonna stop
talking for like a second

00:00:25.424 --> 00:00:27.587
and see if you can come
up with what this is

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:30.444
or maybe I'll give you three seconds

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:31.995
'cause the whole point
here is to estimate,

00:00:31.995 --> 00:00:34.765
not get the exact right answer.

00:00:34.765 --> 00:00:37.308
Okay, so I'm assuming
you've had a go at it.

00:00:37.308 --> 00:00:38.732
Now, I'll tell you how I think about it.

00:00:38.732 --> 00:00:41.013
We of course could maybe
take out some paper

00:00:41.013 --> 00:00:42.037
or you might even be able to get

00:00:42.037 --> 00:00:44.171
the exact answer in your head

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:46.610
but in everyday life, if
you're at the supermarket

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.934
and you're like, okay,

00:00:47.934 --> 00:00:49.873
I guess it would be an
expensive supermarket,

00:00:49.873 --> 00:00:53.867
something is $398, something else is $251.

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.333
Roughly how much would I be spending

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:56.881
if I bought both of them?

00:00:56.881 --> 00:00:58.564
Well, my head would say, alright,

00:00:58.564 --> 00:01:02.064
398, I would round to nearest 10 at least,

00:01:02.964 --> 00:01:04.029
maybe the nearest 100.

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:05.741
So let's round to the nearest 10.

00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:09.792
In the case of 398, the
nearest 10 is the nearest 100.

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:12.731
And so we would get to,
this is approximately 400.

00:01:12.731 --> 00:01:16.314
And then this is, 251
is approximately 250.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.622
So if you were to add these two things up,

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:20.610
you're going to get something

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.527
that is approximately equal to 650.

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.734
And lucky for us, that
is one of the choices

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.107
and what I'm about to do is not estimate

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:33.270
but just see how far off we were.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.437
So if we were to just
actually do it, 398 plus 251.

00:01:39.401 --> 00:01:41.241
Eight plus one is nine.

00:01:41.241 --> 00:01:43.563
Nine plus five is 14.

00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:44.995
This is 14 10s.

00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:46.100
We put four 10s here,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.267
and the other 10 10s we regroup as 100

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.193
and then one plus three plus 200 is 600.

00:01:54.193 --> 00:01:55.866
So in this case, in this particular case,

00:01:55.866 --> 00:01:58.273
we got awfully close with our estimation

00:01:58.273 --> 00:02:00.199
and if you don't need
to get the exact number,

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:02.428
well, that'll be fine.

00:02:02.428 --> 00:02:04.018
Let's do another example.

00:02:04.018 --> 00:02:06.908
In here, we are going to do
a little bit of subtraction.

00:02:06.908 --> 00:02:08.546
So once again, pause this video

00:02:08.546 --> 00:02:10.626
or try to do it as quickly as you can.

00:02:10.626 --> 00:02:13.206
Try to estimate what this
difference is going to be.

00:02:13.206 --> 00:02:14.373
678 minus 273.

00:02:17.037 --> 00:02:18.262
Alright, let's do it together.

00:02:18.262 --> 00:02:21.398
So there's a couple of ways to tackle it.

00:02:21.398 --> 00:02:23.642
You could round to the nearest 10

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:26.038
and you could say, well,
this is approximately 600,

00:02:26.038 --> 00:02:27.580
let's see, to round to the nearest 10,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.102
you would round up right over here

00:02:29.102 --> 00:02:31.602
so you'd say this is 680 minus

00:02:33.018 --> 00:02:34.435
you could say 270

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.234
which is going to give you

00:02:38.234 --> 00:02:40.554
and here you're still gonna
have to do some mental math.

00:02:40.554 --> 00:02:41.494
This would be what?

00:02:41.494 --> 00:02:43.161
600 minus 200 is 400

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:46.912
and 80 minus 70 is 10.

00:02:46.912 --> 00:02:48.310
So that's one way to do it

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.572
or you could do it even rougher.

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.735
You could just do to the nearest 100.

00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.855
So you could say, look, 678,

00:02:53.855 --> 00:02:56.018
the nearest 100 is 700

00:02:56.018 --> 00:03:00.138
and then minus 273, the
nearest 100 there is 300

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.040
and so this is even rougher

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.679
but it gets us actually
still similar answers

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.424
and either way we estimated,

00:03:07.424 --> 00:03:09.184
either the kind of rougher way

00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:11.060
or the slightly less rough way,

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.914
we got to something around 400.

00:03:13.914 --> 00:03:16.238
So you could feel good
that this is your choice.

00:03:16.238 --> 00:03:17.256
The reason why we even have to make

00:03:17.256 --> 00:03:19.008
multiple choice questions for estimation

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:21.575
is not everyone is gonna
get the exact same estimate

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:24.013
but the correct choice should be the one

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:28.096
that any reasonable estimate
would be closest to.
