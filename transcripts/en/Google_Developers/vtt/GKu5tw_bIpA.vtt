00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.560
R can handle a lot more
than numbers.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.750
For example, you can handle
character objects, which are

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.570
also known as strings.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.280
We can make a simple character
object just by putting some

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.460
text in quotation marks.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.980
You might notice something we
saw before, which is that the

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.490
output is again preceded
by a 1 in brackets.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000
This character object is a
vector, and we can create a

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.080
longer vector using the
concatenate function.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.680
As with numerical vectors, we
can apply functions to a

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.110
character vector to learn more
about it or get summary

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.360
information.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.770
In addition to the numeric and
character type of vector, we

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.790
can create a Boolean vector.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:50.790
In the simplest case, we can
write TRUE in all caps, or we

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.620
can write FALSE in all caps.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.270
We can also create a vector of
TRUE and FALSE values using

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.520
the concatenate function.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.950
One of the really handy features
of Boolean vectors is

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.480
that they can be used to extract
specific elements of a

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.290
vector that meet a
certain criteria.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.690
For example, here I'll use the
NCHAR function to find out the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.540
number of characters
in each character

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.690
string in the vector.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.830
Then we're going to create a
new vector called under.10.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.930
This vector will indicate which
elements of v have less

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.930
than 10 characters.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.690
Finally, I can subset
v using under.10.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.880
In the next video, we'll start
doing arithmetic with vectors.
