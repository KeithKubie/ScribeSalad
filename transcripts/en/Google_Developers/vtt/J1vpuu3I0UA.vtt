IEIN VALDEZ: Hi, I'm Iein
Valdez, a developer advocate

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:03.270
with Google App Engine.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.120
I'm here to show you how easy
it is to get up and running

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.090
with a Python application.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.100
So what I've done is I've
installed the Python app

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.090
engine, SDK.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.780
Locally I'm running
it on a Mac.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.670
It also is easy to install
on Windows or on Linux.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.910
So it's a small download, and
you should be up and running

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.620
in a few minutes.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.280
So let's go ahead and start the

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.540
Google App Engine Launcher.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.500
And what we're going to do is
create our first project.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.120
So in the bottom, left-hand
corner we can create a new

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.700
application.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.750
And let's go ahead and name
our application iein-demo.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.510
I'm going to go ahead
and click Create.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.750
And what that has done is it has
created a starter project

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.000
for us with some sample code.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.650
So let's go ahead
and click Edit.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.950
And we see here that it has got
four files set up for me,

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.890
app.yaml, which is where
my application

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.840
configuration's set up.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.210
We can look through
this real quick.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.700
I have my application name.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.605
We see I'm running in Python.

00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:57.015
And I have two handlers set up,
one to serve a favicon for

00:00:57.015 --> 00:01:00.400
me, and the second is to route
all other incoming requests to

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.350
that main.py Python script.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.680
So let's take a look at
the main.py script.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.430
And this is a very simple
web-app handler that literally

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.020
prints out hello world.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.923
So let's go ahead
and run this.

00:01:12.923 --> 00:01:14.280
And let's take a look and
see what it looks like.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.230
So we're going to go back
here, click Run.

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.780
And the nice thing about the
app engine SDK is that it

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.880
mimics our cloud environment
locally on your desktop.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.920
So you can see what
it's like to run

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.450
your application locally.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.330
So I have the application
running.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.950
I'm going to click the Browse
button, which is going to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.880
launch my browser and
point it locally.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.820
And we see here, I've got hello
world, which is great.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.750
But now I want to make some
changes and iterate.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450
And let's see what that
experience is like.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.550
So we're going to go back here
into my text editor.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.150
And let's make a couple
of changes.

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.220
We'll just say, hello world,
I love the cloud.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.750
I'll click Save. We can go back
into our browser, hit

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.120
Refresh, and you see that the
code is refreshed with the

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.080
latest changes that I've made.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.730
So it makes it really easy
to make changes to your

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:59.810
application and test them.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.045
So now, let's get
this application

00:02:02.045 --> 00:02:02.850
running in the cloud.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.710
I'm ready for business.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.060
I'm ready to have millions
of users hit my little

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.260
application.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.210
Let's see what that's like.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.229
So we'll go into the App
Engine Launcher.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.320
And you'll see in the right hand
corner here, we have this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.830
Deploy button.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.430
So I'm going to go ahead
and click that.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.560
And I have my credentials
already set up.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.930
And so what this is doing is
taking the code that is on my

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.590
desktop and packaging it up
and shipping it off to

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.420
Google's data centers and
servers and essentially

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.070
loading it up there.

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.460
So it will package up any
images, any static files,

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.940
everything that I need to
get up and running.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.870
So we see here that now
it has essentially

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.400
pushed the data up.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.610
The deployment was successful.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.290
So now let's go ahead and hit
the website and see if it's up

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.590
and running.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.310
So my app is called
iein-demo.appspot.com.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.316
There we go.

00:02:49.316 --> 00:02:50.630
Hit Refresh a couple times.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.290
We can see that it's
actually running.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.610
And now I've basically taken my
simple Python application

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.000
from my desktop, pushed it to
Google's cloud, and it's now

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.800
auto-scaled.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.520
And millions and millions of
users are able to hit that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.560
application.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.440
So it's really easy to get up
and running, especially on the

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.470
Python runtime.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.560
Take a look and get your first
app up and running.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.810
Thanks much.
