00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.980
PAUL RILEY: Good afternoon.


00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.270
My name is Paul Riley, and
I'm a senior in the politics

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.010
department here at
Princeton University.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:20.930
And today, on this
beautiful Friday afternoon,

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.200
I'm happy to be at
HireTigers Meetup,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.490
a new alternative
career fair put

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.270
on by the Office
of Career services.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.960
Hire Tigers Meet Up is truly
an alternative career fair.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.630
When you're walking
throughout the tent,

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.630
you can see companies from
a broad array of industries.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.910
So you have so many
opportunities for students

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.720
to really challenge
and reimagine

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.930
what it means to have a
career outside of Princeton.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.390
PULIN SANGHVI:
Today's event turned

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.540
on its head many
of the assumptions

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.180
underlying the traditional
job fair model.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.280
We held it outdoors in
an informal setting.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.210
And we involved alumni
and employers in new ways.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.630
And there was a sense of genuine
exploration and serendipitous

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.650
conversations happening
all around us.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.150
PAUL RILEY: There
were bistro tables

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:03.940
where you could walk
up to alums and really

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.350
learn about their career
path, how they ended up

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.260
where they did.


00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.410
You can see how they took
the unconventional roots.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.120
And that's really
encouraging for someone

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.820
like me, who as a senior doesn't
have everything figured out.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.360
PULIN SANGHVI: The
event was designed

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.300
from the ground up with deep
input from the students.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.100
They helped us challenge
the assumptions

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.420
of the traditional
job fair model.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.040
The panel discussions brought
out tremendous insights

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.010
on things like whether
your major is connected

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.950
to what your career
opportunities will be.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.570
DANIEL EDWARDS: Being
a religion major,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.530
I probably have a major
that most people won't

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.780
have when I'm applying for jobs.


00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.150
What type of specific things
would you say you look for?

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.570
BLAIR LABATT: We
all know that you

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.480
don't have to be a theologian
if you major in religion.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.250
You don't have to be a book
editor if you major in English.

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.770
DUSTIN DAVIDSON: I can
kind of separate myself

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.410
as showing my sense of
curiosity, my willingness

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.320
to follow my passion, as opposed
to what I'm supposed to do.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320
JAKE ROBERTSON: I was
wondering if you guys have

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.140
any opinions on
starting somewhere else?

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.410
I'm from Chicago.


00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.120
PAUL BOGAEV: Yes.


00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.170
Chicago is the first-- the
theater scene is great there.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.540
BARBARA SCHOTTENFELD: If you're
in love with the process,

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.220
as David said, you
really can't fail.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.800
Because if the show doesn't
go on to the next step or et

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.590
cetera, at least you've
had that experience.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.520
If you work on something
for the wrong reasons

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.400
and it doesn't work,
then what do you have?

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.700
ROBERT N SANDBERG: That's
also about it being a career.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.880
If that's the reason that you do
this because you love doing it.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.590
PULIN SANGHVI: The
organization's told us

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.570
that they felt more
visible and able

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.630
to engage in better
conversations.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.310
The alumni told us that
this was a great venue

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.270
to share their journey and
their stories with the students.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.500
And the students told us that
this was a great and informal

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.560
way to make connections
and personally explore

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.910
what meaningful
work means to them.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.930
I think what made
this event so special

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.380
was the way that all of us--
students, alumni, employers,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.830
and Career Services-- came
together as one community

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.870
to create something
extraordinary for the student

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:59.370
experience.
