00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.690
Life is absurdly complex, extremely specialized,
and so far we haven’t found it anywhere

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.690
else.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.550
So we must have just gotten really lucky right?

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.860
Well, maybe not.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:16.190
Hello you lively bunch, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.500
There are a lot of ideas to explain the origin
of life on earth.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.430
There’s panspermia, the idea that life forms
took a cosmic hitch-hike and crashed into

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.470
our blue dot 4 billion years ago.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.289
There’s primordial soup, which hypothesizes
that when you take ancient earth’s chemical

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.850
conditions and add a dash of lightning you
can turn inorganic precursors into organic

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.850
compounds.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.140
Sounds crazy but the Miller-Urey experiment
of 1952 tested that and came up with over

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.879
20 amino acids, the building blocks of proteins.

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.850
But now there’s been a new idea put forward
that’s so simple, so elegant, and so novel

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.329
it might change everything we know about life
and where it comes from.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.629
Jeremy England, a physicist at MIT, has proposed
that life is something that matter just does

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.690
when exposed to an external energy source
like the sun and surrounded by a heat bath

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.940
like the ocean.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.269
it sounds like a cop out but there’s math
behind it.

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:05.980
England’s hypothesis operates on the second
law of thermodynamics, which states that as

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:11.760
time passes, the total entropy of a system
increases until it reaches thermodynamic equilibrium.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.700
That in english basically means that systems
dissipate energy until it is equally distributed.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.280
Entropy is often equated to chaos, but that
isn’t quite right and saying that to scientists

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.330
will make them laugh at you.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.220
At least that’s what Trace tells me.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.890
Anyway when going by the “entropy = disorder”
misconception life seems like it violates

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.500
this law of thermodynamics.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.060
Living things are orderly and organized, though
I can never seem to find my wallet.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.940
But because living things dissipate energy
in the form of heat, we’re actually adding

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.520
to the overall entropy of the universe and
thus the second law is conserved.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.250
According to England, atoms actually form
organic molecules and eventually life because

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.950
it’s a naturally more efficient way to dissipate
energy.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.690
They have to be getting that energy from somewhere
and be surrounded by a bath like an ocean

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.940
or atmosphere to dump heat in, but that’s
exactly the conditions of this new place called

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:57.940
Earth.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.320
This also supports why life reproduces; reproduction
makes more compounds that dissipate more energy.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.960
Therefore when natural selection is applied,
successful life forms should waste as little

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.520
energy as possible reproducing but should
still be above a theoretical minimum.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.200
When England looked at E. coli in 2012, he
found that the bacteria operated just above

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.330
this minimum floor of waste heat.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.160
England’s math checks out, but whether or
not it’s why life came to exist is still

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.160
up for debate.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.319
Currently experiments are being formulated
to test the hypothesis.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.470
But even if it turns out to be a non-starter,
England’s novel idea will tell us a lot

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.170
about a question we’ve been asking for millennia.

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.790
There are a lot of really interesting ideas
on where life comes from and we still have

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.200
no conclusive scientific evidence for one
or the other.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.290
Anthony’s got a great bit on primordial
soup in this video over here.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.600
Alright guys I can already hear those fingers
flying in the comment section so I’m sure

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.830
I don’t have to prompt you, but I will say
this; we strive to be open minded and welcoming

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.830
here at DNews and we want our online community
to be the same.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.310
Stay civil, stay smart, and I’ll see you
next time on DNews.
