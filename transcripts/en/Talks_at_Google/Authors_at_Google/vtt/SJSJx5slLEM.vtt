[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.150
EZRA BRETTLER: It's my pleasure
to introduce Elizabeth Rosner.

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.660
She's here today to speak
about her most recent book,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.059
"Survivor Café, The Legacy
of Trauma and the Labyrinth

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.650
of Memory."

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.290
It grapples with intricate
and possibly unanswerable

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.260
questions about how we recognize
and cope with the traumas

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.330
we inherit, and
how we can properly

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.420
keep alive the personal
stories behind great historical

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.740
atrocities even after everyone
who lived through them is gone.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.060
In her focus on
Holocaust survivors,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.750
Rosner uses the lens of
three visits to Germany

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.120
with her father, who
was born in Hamburg

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.420
and imprisoned in Buchenwald
concentration camp.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.900
The book also investigates the
multi-generational aftermath

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.180
of the bombings of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.840
the Cambodian killing fields,
the legacies of slavery,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.370
and other historical atrocities.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.130
I could read from any one of
dozens of endorsements for this

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.820
book, but I'll choose one from
the "San Francisco Chronicle,"

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.500
which named "Survivor Café" one
of the 100 best books of 2017.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
"Survivor Café feels like the
book Rosner was born to write.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.880
Each page is imbued with
urgency, with sincerity,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.920
with heartache, with heart.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.270
Her words, alongside the words
of other survivors of atrocity

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.310
and their descendants
across the globe,

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.330
can help us build a
more humane world."

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:28.450
Prior to "Survivor Café,"
Elizabeth published three

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.900
bestselling novels, the first
of which, "The Speed of Light,"

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.420
was internationally acclaimed
and translated into nine

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.740
languages.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.290
Its central theme addresses
the effects of the Holocaust

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.900
on the descendants of survivors.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.240
A graduate of
Stanford, UC Irvine,

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.270
and the University of Queensland
in Australia, Elizabeth

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.955
is also my aunt.

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:50.080
I had the opportunity to
accompany her on the third

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.420
of the trips to Germany
with my grandfather,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.190
after which she started putting
pen to paper on "Survivor

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.670
Café."

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.360
Without further ado,
Elizabeth Rosner.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.986
ELIZABETH ROSNER:
Thank you, Ezra.

00:02:01.986 --> 00:02:03.360
You forgot to
introduce yourself.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.740
That was Ezra Brettler my
nephew, an employee of Google.

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.770
It's great to be here.

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.090
Thank you for coming.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.010
Thank you for spending
lunch time with me.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.570
My hope today is that I
will share with you some

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.540
of what I think of as the
highlights of what I learned

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.500
while writing this book.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.570
It's a blending of the
personal narrative.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:31.650
As Ezra mentioned, my
role in life, in a way,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.350
as a daughter of two
Holocaust survivors.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.390
Please help yourselves
to books as you come in.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.770
They're for you.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.870
And that then led me to
reaching into a wider

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.760
research-based approach
to other lineages that

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.030
seem to carry residue
from historical trauma.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.520
And Ezra mentioned
a few of them.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.030
I'll touch on some
of them in my talk.

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.450
And I also am going to share
with you some things that we

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.160
are learning in the realm
of science about measurable,

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.680
evidence-based studies showing
that trauma actually modifies

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.150
the expression of DNA, and
that what we have long known

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.180
as, anecdotally,
children, grandchildren,

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.360
great grandchildren of
people who have endured war

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.200
and genocide and other
acts of violence--

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.730
that that residue seems to
pervade subsequent generations.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.820
Scientists in the field
of genetics-- a new field,

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.430
actually, called
epigenetics is starting

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.150
to show that this is not
something we're just imagining,

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.220
that it's actually
present and measurable.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.960
Then, I'm going to touch on
some of the impacts of memory

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.830
studies and the ways that we
memorialize the past that also

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.370
relate to how not just
personal inheritance of trauma,

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.900
but the collective
inheritance of trauma

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.880
can be addressed in
terms of culture,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.380
in terms of shared
memory, and ultimately

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.600
in the hope of healing
and transforming

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.920
some of those legacies into
something more hopeful.

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.770
And in order, we
hope, not to continue

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:18.930
to repeat a lot of the
atrocities of the past.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.200
So to start with, a
little bit about me.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.560
I grew up in upstate New York.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.270
Both of my parents,
as I mentioned,

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.460
were Holocaust survivors.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.270
My mother was in the Vilna
Ghetto, which you may

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.670
be familiar with historically.

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.740
And then, she survived the War.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.500
In hiding with her parents
in the Polish countryside

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.360
as a young teenager.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.930
My father, as you also
heard, was imprisoned

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.310
in the Buchenwald concentration
camp at the age of 15,

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.780
and the camp was liberated just
after he turned 16 years old.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.110
My parents ended up meeting
as refugees in Sweden,

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.770
getting married in Israel,
and then coming to America.

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.860
And by the time I was
born, on the very last day

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.890
of the '50s, it was as though I
were being born into the other

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:12.900
life that my parents
had created--

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.530
their American selves,
their reinvented selves.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.890
And yet, I really did feel
as though something had been

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.410
transmitted to me in utero.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.530
And for a long time
people like me,

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.320
children of Holocaust
survivors, were

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.650
told that we were being
hysterical or too sensitive

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.560
about feeling as though
our emotional landscape,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.250
our psychological landscape,
was so impacted by something

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.110
that didn't happen to us.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.510
But in fact, as I
mentioned, we are

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:47.500
starting to recognize that
this is a real phenomenon.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.360
So I became a writer
partly because I kept

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.390
on wanting to ask questions.

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:58.260
You've probably heard that
writers are encouraged

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:59.820
to write what they know.

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:03.870
Well, in my case, I wanted to
write what I wanted to know.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.960
So writing for me has always
been an act of curiosity

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.120
and inquiry and investigation.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.100
And this book, even
though it comes

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.570
after three novels and a
poetry collection, in many ways

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.880
really does feel
like the book that

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.950
contains all of
the questions I've

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.080
been asking all of my life.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.430
What is it that I carry that
happened before I was born?

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.060
How does that not
differentiate me from others,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.990
but actually make me feel
even more connected to others?

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:35.790
When I was growing
up, I often felt

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.940
like I was markedly
different from my peers.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.870
A lot of the Americans
in my hometown

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.820
had been there for generations.

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.800
I was a first-generation
American,

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.680
as was my older sister
and my younger brother,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.080
so we had something in
common with each other.

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.040
And our small kind of tribe, my
parents' friends a lot of them

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:59.580
were also survivors of
the Holocaust in Europe.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.340
But in the larger
sense, I didn't feel

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:04.980
like I was much like my peers.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.950
And so, over time, I
started to recognize

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:13.020
that the more I looked into
what I felt made me so unusual--

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.860
that I felt so
sensitive to, let's say,

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:20.580
anxieties or preparing
for catastrophe,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.320
or there were some
friends of mine

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:25.830
I know whose parents
also survived going

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:28.230
into exile from the Holocaust.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.950
They always kept a suitcase
packed just in case.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:36.150
Things like that we considered
normal, most of our friends

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.060
thought that was a little
bizarre, a little paranoid

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:42.330
maybe, or a little
over-reactive, oversensitive.

00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:45.990
And yet, over time, I
became more and more clear

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:50.730
that, in fact, subsequent
generations of Japanese

00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:53.970
who survived Hiroshima
and Nagasaki actually

00:07:53.970 --> 00:07:58.090
have some similar behavior
patterns and thought patterns.

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.400
So do the descendants of
African-American slaves

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:03.900
in the United States.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:08.430
So do refugees from
Cambodia who survived

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:11.160
the killing fields in Cambodia.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.570
And unfortunately,
the list does go on.

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.830
It's a big list.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:19.530
And in the book, I don't
cover every atrocity

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:21.570
because, in fact, the
more research I did,

00:08:21.570 --> 00:08:24.810
the more I realized that
even in the news as I

00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:28.540
was writing the book new
atrocities were taking place.

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:30.780
So I don't, for
example, include what's

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.450
happening to the
Rohingya in Myanmar

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:36.750
even though that
is in this moment

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:40.419
a genocide unfolding
before our eyes.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:44.340
So the conversation
is a big one,

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:47.520
and what I'm trying
to do is allow you

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.660
some intimate access
to a personal story

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.960
and then see how you might
find your own connection

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.340
to that story.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.590
Even if you don't
necessarily recognize

00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:01.080
any of the places
I've referred to,

00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.840
your own family
lineage is probably

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.310
inscribed with something that
was then passed through you

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:09.540
intergenerationally.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:18.030
I'm going to read you a passage
from one of the psychiatrists

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:21.360
that I cite in my
book who specializes

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.070
in inherited trauma.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:25.920
She works with
families whose children

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:29.130
seem to be exhibiting
signs of PTSD

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:31.410
even when the
children themselves

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.424
have not been traumatized.

00:09:34.424 --> 00:09:36.090
And this is the great
mystery that we've

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:37.920
been trying to understand.

00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.050
How is it that you
can look at somebody

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:45.090
who grew up seemingly in a safe
and protected environment still

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:47.310
be displaying signs of PTSD?

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.970
So I'm going to read you
her definition of how

00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:52.580
this PTSD shows up.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:59.410
"Unresolved trauma takes
two different forms.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.320
The first is dissociation,
where the trauma is blocked.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.270
There are no words.

00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:11.280
Not only pushed away, but
insecurely pushed away."

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:14.100
And just to explain
about that a little bit.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:18.060
So this kind of numbing
effect, this way

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:22.380
of sort of not being present in
the moment, is for some people

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:25.170
a form of PTSD.

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.110
An inability to
manage their emotions

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.260
is so overwhelming that
they just shut down

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.870
completely emotionally.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:36.600
"The second way,
the opposite way,

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.130
is where the trauma is
uncontainable, overflowing.

00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:44.520
Interactions are
overflowing with emotion.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.490
The person mixes
past and present.

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.930
The trauma intrudes in
places it doesn't belong."

00:10:51.930 --> 00:10:54.120
And that's the sentence I
really want to focus on.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.900
"The trauma intrudes on
places it doesn't belong."

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:02.340
It's sometimes defined as
people's inability to feel safe

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.990
in a safe environment.

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:08.730
So you may know someone
or have witnessed someone

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.160
or experienced it
yourself sitting

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.590
in a perfectly quiet place--

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.910
out in nature, perhaps--

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.920
where everything
seems to be completely

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.530
tranquil and unthreatening.

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:23.970
And yet, your heart is racing,
your pulse is going mad.

00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:25.980
You might break out in a sweat.

00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:28.440
These are signs that,
internally, you're

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.040
experiencing not what the
present moment is offering up,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.210
but some associative
experience that makes you

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.100
feel as though you're
not in the present.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:42.540
You're actually in some
other past maybe experiencing

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.260
things that were handed
to you by parents

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.120
or even grandparents.

00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:54.480
So I'm going to try to define
epigenetics for you briefly

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.500
and to say, first of all,
that I'm not a scientist.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:03.090
So sometimes, people object
to the concept of epigenetics

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.450
as though they want
to take issue with it.

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.910
And you're welcome to look it
up and do your own research.

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.880
I'm not the person who
has done the research.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.560
I'm citing the research.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.285
So it began with mice.

00:12:18.390 --> 00:12:22.920
Emory University in Atlanta,
a group of geneticists

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:27.030
took some pre-adolescent
mice and exposed them

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:29.430
to the scent of
cherry blossom, which

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.870
is a chemical compound,
and an electroshock.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:38.100
So the mice quickly learned
to associate that scent

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.600
with fear, panic, and pain.

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.050
So even when the shock
was no longer present,

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:46.830
they would get
extremely agitated.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.704
When these mice
produced offspring--

00:12:49.704 --> 00:12:51.370
now, remember, they
were pre-adolescent,

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:53.280
so none of these
mice was pregnant,

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.460
there were no baby
mice in utero--

00:12:56.460 --> 00:12:58.710
three and four
generations of mice

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:01.530
later, when those
mice were exposed

00:13:01.530 --> 00:13:06.480
to cherry blossom for the
first time, they panicked.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.230
They acted as if they already
knew the associative pain

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:11.790
that they might receive.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:16.730
They had never witnessed
their ancestry mice

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:19.820
being exposed to the
scent or the shock.

00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.340
So these researchers
concluded that something

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.060
had shifted in the DNA that
was being passed to them.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:29.540
Now, the DNA itself wasn't
necessarily being modified.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.930
It was epigenetically,
meaning something

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:36.650
on top of the DNA in the
gene was being modified.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.630
And they call that the
expression of the gene.

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:42.140
Sometimes, cortisol levels,
which are associated with

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:43.070
stress--

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:47.720
hormone that we produce to
help us respond to stress--

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.600
was either suppressed
or exaggerated.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.850
At the same time that
those studies with mice

00:13:52.850 --> 00:13:55.250
were going on, there
were researchers

00:13:55.250 --> 00:13:58.430
in Israel looking at
Holocaust survivor families

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.770
and noticing something similar.

00:14:00.770 --> 00:14:03.260
That grandchildren,
great grandchildren

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:07.580
of Holocaust survivors
were coming in for therapy

00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:11.630
with symptoms of PTSD for
trauma that they themselves

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:13.380
had not lived through.

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:18.560
And so they started to connect
the dots between these studies.

00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.700
The studies are small.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:22.740
Humans don't reproduce
as quickly as mice.

00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:26.330
So we don't know
yet how residual,

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.940
how long lasting
these effects are,

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:35.330
but notable enough for people
to raise questions and encourage

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:38.340
more studies to be
done to look into this.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.960
So it turns out that, for
example, Cambodian refugees

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:44.720
living in the United
States are coming

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.110
into therapeutic contexts
with about a 95% rate of PTSD

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.850
in the community.

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:54.860
Off-the-charts high.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.120
In Cambodia, it's estimated
that somewhere between one

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.970
out of four and one out
of every three Cambodians

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:05.110
was murdered by the Khmer Rouge.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:10.540
Monumental portions of the
population were impacted--

00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:14.320
not only by the losses,
but by the fear associated

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:17.110
with those losses, the
reign of terror that

00:15:17.110 --> 00:15:20.440
lasted for the years the
Khmer Rouge were in power.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.990
And you can sort of
do the math yourself.

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:25.940
These numbers need
to be looked at.

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:29.890
So what's happening in the
United States right now,

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:32.350
I think, is pretty
strong evidence

00:15:32.350 --> 00:15:36.250
that we have unresolved
trauma throughout the country.

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:42.430
We have unresolved legacies of
racism, slavery, Jim Crow laws,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.410
you name it-- lynching.

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:46.900
The aftermath of
lynching in a community

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.480
has never fully been addressed.

00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.430
And we are seeing what
it looks like when

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:54.070
we don't address
trauma, when we don't

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:57.250
address the residue of trauma.

00:15:57.250 --> 00:16:01.900
In Japan, they also have
similar investigations

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:05.560
into these lineages of
the survivors of Hiroshima

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.550
and Nagasaki who, for
example, were often completely

00:16:09.550 --> 00:16:11.650
silent on the subject.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:14.920
Their radiation
exposure was so severe

00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:19.640
that they feared that, if
their children were known

00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.950
to be the offspring of
people who had been exposed

00:16:21.950 --> 00:16:25.970
to radiation, no one would want
to marry them because of fear

00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:27.660
of birth defects.

00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:29.900
So there was a long
history of silence

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:34.580
about the effects of those
bombs and the fallout--

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.750
the literal fallout.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:39.480
We use fallout now as a
metaphor, but it was literal.

00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.910
It still is literal.

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:43.670
So a lot of what I'm
talking about in my book

00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:48.140
is actually this interconnection
between literal residue,

00:16:48.140 --> 00:16:52.370
literal lasting
radioactivity in the body,

00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.470
and what that means
metaphorically--

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.710
that we do carry
the effects of what

00:16:57.710 --> 00:17:02.510
happened to our ancestors
and our cultural companions,

00:17:02.510 --> 00:17:04.550
our compatriots.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.810
So what that leads me,
then, to consider is,

00:17:09.810 --> 00:17:12.329
how do we do this
memory together?

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.640
How do we remember not just
what happened in my family,

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.220
for example?

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:22.349
My nephew introduced this
story of three different trips

00:17:22.349 --> 00:17:27.910
I took to Germany with
my father, one in 1983,

00:17:27.910 --> 00:17:32.550
one in 1995 and
the third in 2015.

00:17:32.550 --> 00:17:37.740
So in 1983, I was in my 20s,
my father was in his 50s,

00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:39.930
and Germany was still divided.

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:43.530
So when we went
first to Hamburg then

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.900
to Berlin to pass through
Checkpoint Charlie

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:48.630
to get permission to
enter into East Germany

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.650
and visit the site of the
camp, what we were facing

00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.890
was a culture, a country,
that was choosing to remember

00:17:55.890 --> 00:17:58.250
the past in a particular way.

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:03.630
Their historical version of what
had happened in World War II

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.680
focused primarily on the
victory for them of communism

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.420
over fascism.

00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:12.870
When we tried to visit the
site of the concentration camp,

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:15.840
we were directed away
from the camp itself

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:20.130
to a monument located
a couple of kilometers

00:18:20.130 --> 00:18:26.160
away that had victorious
communist statues celebrating

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.950
their victory over the fascists.

00:18:28.950 --> 00:18:31.750
Jews were not part
of the conversation.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:35.370
So my father and I did find our
way to the site of the camp.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.600
There was nobody there.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.040
We were the only
two people there.

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.520
It was this vast, barren field
of gravel still surrounded

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:50.320
by barbed wire and guard
towers, but nobody inside them.

00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.370
So that was my first
experience of feeling

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:55.890
the presence of those ghosts.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.870
And the fact that
I could share this

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:02.070
with my father in such a way
that literally, literally

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.310
we both heard in
the wind the sound

00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:08.080
of people screaming
at the same time.

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.280
And for me, that was a
palpable sense in my body

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.970
that something my
father had lived through

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:17.260
was really passing into my body.

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.720
And at the end of
that trip, he said,

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.720
I want to come back with
the rest of the family.

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:27.330
I was becoming a
writer, and, of course,

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:30.090
my material seemed so obvious.

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:33.190
My family's story
was my material.

00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:37.380
So flash forward 12
years later to 1995.

00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:40.530
And now, my siblings and
I, my mother, and my father

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:46.410
are all going to the
reunified Germany together.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:19:51.270
And Buchenwald is now the
center of a commemoration site.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:58.120
It was being celebrated
with a feast, a banquet,

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.820
on the site of the
concentration camp--

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.660
a completely surreal event
that I write about in the book.

00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:07.630
I felt like Fellini
had filmed this.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:10.750
It was just bizarre,
a giant tent

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:13.060
on the site of this place
where so many people were

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.970
starved and worked to
death and murdered.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:18.550
And right in the
middle of the meal,

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:22.276
one of my father's
front teeth fell out.

00:20:22.276 --> 00:20:23.900
And suddenly, he
looked-- have you ever

00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:27.770
seen someone with a missing
tooth, this hole suddenly

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:30.920
appearing in his
smile and his face.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.470
And I was remembering,
in that experience,

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:35.570
that when we had
been there in 1983

00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:39.680
together he passed a kidney
stone while we were there.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:42.680
So you can see how the
body has its own way

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:46.700
of remembering trauma and
re-experiencing, revisiting

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:47.990
trauma.

00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:51.350
So now, the context was
Germany was reunified.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:56.960
They were trying to reorganize
their memory, literally,

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:59.000
of how they were
remembering what had

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.670
happened during World War II.

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:07.520
20 years later, 2015, my
nephew and I and my Father

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:09.450
are all in the same place.

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:12.440
Now, we're three
generations together.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.580
And we are being echoed and
met by three generations

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.640
of Germans, especially
the grandchildren,

00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:27.650
who call themselves like
the Jewish compartment

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:30.740
generation of survivors,
third generation,

00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:32.540
they call themselves 3G.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.520
That's how I found out I was 2G
because my 3G nephew explained

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.510
to me that I was now a member
of this second generation.

00:21:41.510 --> 00:21:43.460
The grandchildren
of the survivors

00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:46.100
and the grandchildren
of the Nazis

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:48.410
were now taking
it upon themselves

00:21:48.410 --> 00:21:51.320
to remember together
what had happened.

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.750
So there was this
remarkable bridge

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.330
across the great
divide of history,

00:21:56.330 --> 00:22:00.230
to say it's our obligation
to remember this together

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:04.610
and to look at our counterparts
as fellow travelers

00:22:04.610 --> 00:22:08.780
through this journey of
what part of the past

00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.980
is still impacting us
now in the present.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.340
In Japan, something
similar is happening.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.400
The first, second, and
third-generation survivors

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:22.130
of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki are also

00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:26.300
asking themselves, how do
we keep this memory alive?

00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.800
And I mentioned a
little while ago

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:31.490
that this memory is both
personal and collective.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:35.390
Even if you're not personally
related to the survivors,

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:38.750
how do more we all carry
this in a shared way?

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.770
And in Japan, there's
a remarkable role

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:48.080
being taken on by people who
call themselves dinshosha,

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.110
which is translated
as the designated

00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:53.780
transmitter of memory.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.460
And the dinshosha are
memorizing the stories

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.510
of the survivors of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki

00:23:02.510 --> 00:23:05.000
so that they can
tell the story when

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.110
the firsthand experience is
no longer available in person.

00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:14.120
They are literally choosing
to embody the story

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.180
and humanize it, keep it
individual and meaningful

00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:18.840
in that way.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.680
So what are some other
parallels for that?

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:24.500
Well, in South
Africa, you probably

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:30.090
know, after apartheid
ended, Mandela and others

00:23:30.090 --> 00:23:32.790
created something called
the Truth and Reconciliation

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:37.860
Commission, where they
chose to coordinate

00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.600
the remembering of the past--

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:44.810
not in a legal,
punishing format,

00:23:44.810 --> 00:23:48.950
but in a way of creating
dialogue and conversation,

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:51.290
allowing the
victims of apartheid

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.680
to speak to the
perpetrators and be heard,

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:58.310
simply have their stories
be told as the truth.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:24:01.730
Because, one of the first things
that goes in war and atrocity

00:24:01.730 --> 00:24:05.210
and genocide is truth itself.

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:07.400
I'm afraid we're witnessing
a lot of this right

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.270
now in our culture, when
facts are becoming distorted

00:24:11.270 --> 00:24:16.640
and the truth seems blurry
at the edges, blurry at best.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.270
So, in Rwanda,
where there was also

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.930
a horrific genocide
in the late 1990s,

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:28.760
when 800,000 Tutsis were
murdered by their Hutu

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:33.400
neighbors with machetes
in four months--

00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:37.750
800,000 people murdered in
a period of four months--

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:40.840
now, the Rwandan
government is trying

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:45.280
to help the remaining Hutus
and the remaining Tutsis work

00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.210
together to rebuild the
country as neighbors.

00:24:49.210 --> 00:24:52.270
They were neighbors
before the genocide.

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:53.980
They are neighbors again.

00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.060
How does this work?

00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:59.500
How can you bring victims
and perpetrators together

00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.320
in a way that isn't
retraumatizing?

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.330
Well, it's complicated.

00:25:04.330 --> 00:25:06.880
When I was revising
"Survivor Café,"

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.890
every time I wrote about
something like this,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.510
I would go back over the
book again and again.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:16.030
My last time to
reread it, I looked

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:17.290
for the word complicated.

00:25:17.290 --> 00:25:19.480
I did a word search
for complicated.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.150
It showed up 49 times.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:24.940
I had to go back through
and really consider

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:29.110
the nuances of that word, but
everything I was talking about

00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:31.750
was, indeed, complicated.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:36.220
The complication of how many
generations past slavery

00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:39.040
in America are we,
and yet we are still

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.070
bearing witness to
the unresolved trauma

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.400
that it left behind.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:49.890
Bryan Stevenson, who is an
African-American lawyer who

00:25:49.890 --> 00:25:52.200
used to be with the
Southern Poverty Law Center

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.400
and started something called
the Equal Justice Initiative,

00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:02.250
has been determined to create
monuments in every location

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:05.130
where a lynching took place.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:08.820
In Europe, something similar
had been done, is being done.

00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:13.830
An artist put down what he
called Stolpersteine, stumbling

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:17.370
stones, replacing
individual cobblestones

00:26:17.370 --> 00:26:21.600
with gilded-over stones stamped
with the name of a person who

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.650
was murdered.

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:27.430
And they say, here lived this
person's name, this person's

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:30.960
birthdate, and died in
Auschwitz, Treblinka,

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.820
Ravensbruck, Majdanek--

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:37.440
the names of camps, the names
of maybe unknown locations.

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.230
So Bryan Stevenson
said the power

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:44.670
of standing on a spot where
you know an atrocity took

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:48.780
place has to be replicated
in the United States

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:50.940
where these lynching sites were.

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:55.890
Thousands of people witnessed
lynchings in America.

00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.680
It wasn't just the
horrific violence

00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.330
done to the individual.

00:27:00.330 --> 00:27:04.080
There was an act of violence
committed in full view of often

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:06.210
the entire town.

00:27:06.210 --> 00:27:09.570
So how do we remember that in
a way that honors the victim

00:27:09.570 --> 00:27:12.150
and tells the truth
about what happened?

00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:15.810
So plaques are being placed in
locations where lynchings took

00:27:15.810 --> 00:27:19.770
place, and a big
museum in Montgomery

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:23.970
is being built with soil
from each of those places

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.020
to be held in jars
and vessels to say,

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.290
we are all connected by
this earth that we stand on.

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.050
So even though I might
be tempted to say,

00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.300
my ancestors weren't
slave owners,

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.490
I'm a first-generation
American, I

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:40.170
don't have to take
responsibility

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:42.690
for the residue of
this trauma, simply

00:27:42.690 --> 00:27:45.930
by being an American
standing on American soil,

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.090
I do have to take
responsibility for what

00:27:48.090 --> 00:27:50.130
happened in this
country and that I'm

00:27:50.130 --> 00:27:52.770
the beneficiary
of a lot of things

00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:56.490
that we all benefited
from during slavery

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.490
and all of the inhuman
violence committed

00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:06.330
against post-slavery Americans.

00:28:06.330 --> 00:28:09.870
So how do we remember well?

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:14.460
How do we work carefully
to preserve this memory?

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.890
And to keep it
personal, as I said,

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:21.390
and also to keep it alive once
the witnesses and the people

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:25.980
who enacted those crimes or
were the victims of those crimes

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:29.792
are no longer here to remind
us of the human experience?

00:28:29.792 --> 00:28:31.500
So I don't know how
many of you have ever

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:36.570
been to Washington, DC,
the US Holocaust Museum

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:41.790
in Washington DC, and also
the very recently completed

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:44.460
African-American Museum
of History and Culture.

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:45.330
Anybody?

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:46.740
Have you been?

00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.220
They are both astonishingly
important institutions.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.080
I really recommend
that you visit them.

00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:57.240
And they each tell
a story, a narrative

00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:00.450
that is meant to
engage you physically

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:02.470
in the process of memory.

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.640
So at the Holocaust Museum,
when you enter the museum,

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.300
you're conducted to an elevator,
taken up to the top floor.

00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:11.100
And when you step
out of the elevator,

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:13.950
the first thing you
see is a photograph

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:18.150
of American soldiers looking
down at a pile of corpses

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:21.270
that they encountered when they
arrived at a concentration camp

00:29:21.270 --> 00:29:25.240
in Europe in April of 1945.

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.600
Now, what I realized when
I went to that Museum

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.950
and saw that image was that
this is the American version

00:29:31.950 --> 00:29:33.360
of that story.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.540
My version growing
up, as I told you,

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:42.000
before I even knew what I knew,
I knew that something horrible

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.470
had happened to my
parents in Europe

00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.030
that involved images and
situations that I was now

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:48.900
seeing.

00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:53.370
Americans encountered and
thought, oh, now we understand.

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.410
But, of course,
there's a whole story

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.750
that has to be
revisited in order

00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:01.830
to understand what they were
seeing for the first time.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:05.550
So then, you work your way
through the Museum finding out

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:09.030
everything that took place
that led to that moment,

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.320
but it's still an American
frame around a story.

00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:15.450
I think that's really
important to understand--

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.650
that museums, as fact
based as they can be,

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.980
are framing a narrative.

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.752
So what's happening
now in the South,

00:30:22.752 --> 00:30:24.210
where they're
talking about what do

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:27.150
we do with Confederate
statues, is

00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:30.450
a question about who gets
to frame the narrative.

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.610
Do we keep the statues
there because they

00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.870
signify a Civil War that really
did take place in America?

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.450
Well, don't we need
context around them?

00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:41.850
Don't we need to know that
they were defending something

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.640
that we now consider to
be completely abhorrent?

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.060
It wasn't just, oh, the
North won and the South lost.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:50.610
It was that they were
diametrically opposed

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:54.990
ideologies, one of which
believed that you were entitled

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:57.650
to own other people.

00:30:57.650 --> 00:30:59.534
That was a wrong ideology.

00:30:59.534 --> 00:31:00.950
So for us to say,
well, there were

00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:03.980
just two different
ideologies is, I think,

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.050
an affront to the victims.

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:06.710
Right

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:10.180
So now, there's this debate
about what kind of structure

00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.920
or museum can we put
these Confederate statues

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:17.090
inside of so a fuller
story gets told about who

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:19.160
they were, what they meant.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:24.120
And they were on the wrong
side of history, basically.

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.350
So the African-American
Museum of History and Culture,

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.770
interestingly to me,
takes the other approach

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:36.650
from this Holocaust Museum
top-down descent into the past.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:39.020
The African-American
museum starts

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.390
with the past underground.

00:31:41.390 --> 00:31:44.450
You start down below
in this Museum,

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:50.530
and you read and enter into the
centuries of the slave trade--

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:53.530
a lot of which was based
on sugar, so I'll let you

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:55.610
think about that for a moment.

00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.310
Sugar, the demon.

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:03.010
So you climb through this
lower portion of the story,

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:05.350
and you work your way
up through slavery

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:10.270
in America, the Civil War,
followed by Jim Crow, the Civil

00:32:10.270 --> 00:32:11.510
Rights Movement.

00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:14.080
And finally, at the
very top of the museum,

00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:17.560
in this incredible
celebratory way,

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:21.010
you get to experience the
beautiful and significant

00:32:21.010 --> 00:32:23.560
contributions of
African-Americans to American

00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:24.460
culture--

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:31.240
music, dance, theater, language,
fashion, everything, language,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.870
hip hop, the vernacular
expressed through architecture

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:36.490
and movement--

00:32:36.490 --> 00:32:42.700
all of which shows that the
bones that lie underground

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:44.800
have still somehow
managed to produce

00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:49.720
this incredible resilience
and beauty and transformation.

00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:53.230
So weirdly, I decided to
start that Museum at the top.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:55.360
I think I saw all the
crowds going down,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.810
and I wanted to be different.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:58.360
And I started at the top.

00:32:58.360 --> 00:33:00.670
And I'll tell you, it was
hard to leave that floor.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:05.830
It was so full of wonder and joy
and celebration and innovation

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:07.090
and creativity.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.980
But then, I
remembered that I had

00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:11.620
to see what was
buried under that.

00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.000
I had to see what was in the
soil that gave birth to that.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.640
And it reminded me that
we don't just inherit

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.750
the trauma of our ancestors.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:23.690
We inherit the resiliency
of our ancestors.

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:26.560
We inherit the perseverance
of our ancestors

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.690
and the will to
go on and the will

00:33:28.690 --> 00:33:31.480
to create a new life
in a new place--

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.120
like my parents did, like
maybe many of your parents

00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:36.850
or grandparents did.

00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:42.420
So I want to leave you
with a couple of questions

00:33:42.420 --> 00:33:46.080
about consciousness with
language, consciousness

00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.450
with how we use our words.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.750
So I don't know how many of
you react to language the way

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.830
I do, but, for
example, when I hear

00:33:55.830 --> 00:34:00.990
the words ethnic cleansing,
the phrase ethnic cleansing--

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:05.520
which we heard during the
eruptions in Bosnia when

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:09.090
Yugoslavia was falling apart
and the Serbs were trying

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:14.330
to ethnically cleanse
the Christians out

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:16.610
of the Serbian-held
territories--

00:34:16.610 --> 00:34:19.280
there was a big outcry
about what a euphemism

00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.690
that phrase was.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:23.150
That ethnic cleansing was
essentially a cover up

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.280
for genocide and mass murder.

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.540
Do you remember?

00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:31.449
It's come back into
our vocabulary again.

00:34:31.449 --> 00:34:33.510
"The New York
Times" is referring

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.800
to what's happening in
Myanmar as ethnic cleansing.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.900
And sometimes, they put
quotation marks around it,

00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:42.929
and sometimes they don't.

00:34:42.929 --> 00:34:48.600
And to me, this seemingly
normalized version

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.300
of that phrase is
saying something

00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:55.350
about how we have
accepted propaganda terms

00:34:55.350 --> 00:34:58.740
into our vocabulary as if
they are descriptive rather

00:34:58.740 --> 00:35:02.840
than propaganda.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.710
So chain migration
is another phrase.

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.630
There is debate about the use
of the phrase chain migration.

00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:11.570
If you're not aware
of it, look into it.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:18.170
The idea that people who are
legally immigrated into America

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:22.790
and want to bring family and
relatives, now that phrase

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.770
chain migration is being used
again in a propagandist way

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:32.180
to hear these echoes
of, I hear slavery, I

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:38.480
hear chains of poverty, of
lower class relationships,

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:41.000
of illegal activity.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.780
All of these invocations
that this language produces,

00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.830
we need to question.

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.380
So instead of using these
phrases automatically,

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:56.360
I recommend that we use the
phrase family unification

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.390
or reunification instead
of chain migration.

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.370
It's actually more accurate.

00:36:01.370 --> 00:36:02.730
It's equally descriptive.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.310
It's more accurately descriptive
than chain migration.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.890
Instead of ethnic
cleansing, genocide

00:36:09.890 --> 00:36:12.110
is the more appropriate term.

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.720
Mass murder is the
more appropriate term.

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.460
Why do these words matter?

00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:20.150
Because they impact our ways
of thinking about the world.

00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:22.280
They impact how we
see one another,

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.170
the assumptions we make.

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:26.090
Do you remember
when the photograph

00:36:26.090 --> 00:36:29.510
of the drowned
Syrian child appeared

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:33.590
everywhere, one of the
victims of a drowning

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:37.310
off the coast of Greece?

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:42.500
There are millions of refugees
in flight for their lives.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.980
That one photograph
of a drowned child

00:36:45.980 --> 00:36:48.050
was a way of saying
to people, don't

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:53.120
forget this is happening
to one person at a time.

00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:55.340
When you call people
immigrants, it's

00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:58.560
different than when
you call them refugees.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:03.780
The emotional content is really
different in those two terms.

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.170
Don't you feel your heart more
likely to open toward a refugee

00:37:07.170 --> 00:37:10.417
than toward an immigrant who,
the implication being, oh, they

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:12.000
just come are coming
here because they

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.560
want better opportunities?

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:14.370
They?

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:18.340
We should say we, are coming
here for better opportunities.

00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.430
But refugee means,
oh, someone who

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:24.690
has no choice, someone who is
in flight for his or her life

00:37:24.690 --> 00:37:27.430
or the life of their
extended family.

00:37:27.430 --> 00:37:31.650
So language matters because it
impacts how we think and feel

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:36.960
about human lives, about
human lack of choice,

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:41.130
about humans in exile, about
humans who are suffering.

00:37:41.130 --> 00:37:43.860
So, for me, all of
this research was

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:46.350
a way of saying to
myself, what I grew up

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.170
with didn't just
teach me that I was

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.180
carrying a particular burden.

00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:53.940
It taught me that I
have a responsibility

00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:58.220
to be empathetic toward
those who suffer, too--

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:01.070
whether I know their
full story or not,

00:38:01.070 --> 00:38:04.070
whether I know how many
generations back the suffering

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:05.480
goes on or not.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:07.700
But that each
individual actually

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.680
has some kind of legacy
of sorrow, of loss,

00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.750
of harm, of pain.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.190
And it may be vast.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.830
It may be on the scale
of Cambodia, one out

00:38:18.830 --> 00:38:22.610
of three or four people in
the entire country murdered

00:38:22.610 --> 00:38:24.080
by the Khmer Rouge.

00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.960
It might be on a
smaller scale, but it

00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.760
doesn't matter the scale.

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:32.630
What matters is the personal
level of identification

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:36.950
and that willingness to say we
are connected by what we carry,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.850
and we can recognize that in one
another through our language,

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:44.090
through our storytelling,
through our collective forms

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:47.270
of memory in museums
or institutions

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:51.380
or installations like a
stone placed on a sidewalk

00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:55.370
saying this was a person who
lived here and was murdered.

00:38:57.990 --> 00:39:02.700
So, if I may, before I open
it up to your questions--

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.680
which I really welcome and
invite, questions or comments--

00:39:05.680 --> 00:39:08.010
I want to leave
you with an image.

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:13.450
And it's a Japanese term
and a Japanese art form

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:19.210
that I think is, again, a
beautiful metaphor for all

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.460
that I've been
talking about today.

00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:27.250
Kintsugi is sometimes
translated as golden repair,

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:29.410
but I've recently
seen it translated

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:38.350
as the art of embracing damage,
or the art of precious cars--

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:42.850
the art of embracing damage,
the art of precious scars.

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:48.070
So imagine a precious
bowl, a piece of pottery

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.320
that was handed down to
you, or something you made,

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.350
or something you paid a lot
of money for, and it shatters.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:39:57.510
Cry, throw it away.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:58.860
You have a lot of choices.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.740
Replace it with a
new perfect one.

00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:07.110
Kintsugi says you fill
in the cracks with gold.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:11.970
You repair it in such a way
as to enhance and identify

00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:16.110
more fully where the bowl
has been broken and how,

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:19.500
in healing it, in putting
the pieces back together,

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.020
you see all of its history.

00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:26.190
You see the damage it
went through and is still

00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:29.250
not just whole but, in
fact, more beautiful than it

00:40:29.250 --> 00:40:30.970
was before.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.820
So the damage that
we carry doesn't

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:37.020
have to be looked at as loss or
pain that will never go away,

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.970
that we'll never heal from.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:42.780
But neither does it that we're
trying to make it go away

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:46.390
and erase it so that we never
have to look at it again.

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:51.690
The truth is we have ongoing
damage every day, all the time,

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:57.900
to our bodies, our psyches, our
culture, our truth, our story.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:03.900
So this image for me is so, so
resonant of an option we have--

00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:09.610
to hold our damage
delicately, lovingly,

00:41:09.610 --> 00:41:12.150
and to let it be seen.

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:15.750
To say I am not
only that the pain

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:17.450
and the loss that
have happened to me,

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.000
but I am also filled
with something even more

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.010
precious and more
beautiful, which

00:41:23.010 --> 00:41:25.800
is the restoration of self.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.440
And ultimately, I hope
an image like this

00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:32.220
is an indication of what we're
capable of as human beings--

00:41:32.220 --> 00:41:35.700
that we can create
a wholeness that

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.180
doesn't keep repeating the
separations and the murders

00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.600
and the hatreds, but
rebuilds a culture that

00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:48.540
is based on something collective
and connected and healing,

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:49.540
I hope.

00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:51.580
So thank you for
listening to me.

00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.270
I really hope that you'll
make sure to take a book

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:56.850
to take with you to
read and consider,

00:41:56.850 --> 00:41:59.550
but I would love to know if you
have any questions right now

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:00.220
or comments.

00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.250
Yes?

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.860
AUDIENCE: Do you not
believe, when we pass away,

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.610
our body returns to dust,
but the spirit persists?

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:13.020
All the memories, all the
experiences actually persist.

00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.830
Now, let me use a
technical term like cloud.

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:19.410
Imagine all those memories
stay in the cloud.

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:22.340
And if a younger generation,
a different generation

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:26.280
can access that piece of
information using a token,

00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.930
like a password
from the cloud, that

00:42:29.930 --> 00:42:32.710
could explain that
different generations may

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:35.580
be able to the same
traumatic experience,

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:39.612
and somehow you just persist
throughout generations.

00:42:39.612 --> 00:42:40.820
What do you think about that?

00:42:40.820 --> 00:42:42.770
ELIZABETH ROSNER: I love it.

00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:44.910
What I think about
it is that I love it.

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.730
I think it's a
brilliant interweaving

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:52.250
of our technological
understanding of how

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.930
data is saved and this human
data, this data of memory.

00:42:56.930 --> 00:43:00.060
My father actually, who
thankfully is still alive--

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.300
he's going to be 89 in April--

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:05.570
has often said to me,
I wish there was a way

00:43:05.570 --> 00:43:07.550
that all of my
knowledge that I've

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:11.030
gained over all of these
years of living and learning

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:13.640
could be stored
somewhere and saved

00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.710
so that it can be passed on.

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:18.650
What a shame that
it can't be saved.

00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:22.340
And so he's envisioning
this giant brain download.

00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:24.680
But as you say,
it's Spirit, too.

00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.890
It's not just what we hold
in our minds and our bodies.

00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:31.910
There's something that we
don't quite know what it is

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.500
or how it operates.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:35.960
Jung talked about this, too.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.540
Jung envisioned
your cloud, as well,

00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:41.630
when he talked about the
collective unconscious,

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:44.510
and that what we
carry ancestrally

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:47.570
shows up in our
dreams sometimes.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:52.400
I know a woman whose mother was
also in a concentration camp,

00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.700
and this woman has
dreams that, when

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.240
she tells her mother about them,
her mother says, you dreamed

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.470
something that happened to me.

00:44:02.470 --> 00:44:06.760
How is that possible, that a
dream could be transmitted?

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.530
Well, this is the
kind of thing that I

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:10.420
think you've just described.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.210
That it's all being
stored somewhere.

00:44:13.210 --> 00:44:18.580
And that at birth, that token
that you just mentioned,

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:23.440
our birth is our pass
key to access that.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.500
Brilliantly said.

00:44:24.500 --> 00:44:26.350
Thank you for sharing that.

00:44:26.350 --> 00:44:27.890
Any other questions or comments?

00:44:27.890 --> 00:44:28.790
Please.

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:29.290
Sorry.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:31.190
That microphone is so far away.

00:44:34.132 --> 00:44:36.340
AUDIENCE: I notice that most
of the examples you gave

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:41.530
were like large-scale things
like the Holocaust or slavery.

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.910
I'm wondering if you think the
same ideas you've presented

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:50.310
apply to smaller things like
individual trauma or maybe

00:44:50.310 --> 00:44:53.212
what I had in mind, like mass
shootings, or things like that?

00:44:53.212 --> 00:44:54.420
ELIZABETH ROSNER: Absolutely.

00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:55.910
Thank you for that question.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:45:00.190
I think that I do in the
book, talk about 9/11,

00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:02.800
which, of course, as
a country we thought

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.200
of as happening to all of us.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.910
But we know that,
in actual fact,

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:12.700
it happened to two buildings in
New York City and the Pentagon.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.460
We know that, in
theory anyway, it was

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.740
a limited number of victims.

00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:22.540
But what we recognize is that
the entire country does still

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:24.795
feel the reverberations
of that event.

00:45:24.795 --> 00:45:26.920
So I don't know if that's
an example of what you're

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.640
talking about, but I also think
the MeToo movement right now

00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:33.850
is evidence of
something very similar.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:36.820
Women and young
girls who have all

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:40.820
experienced some form of sexual
assault, sexual violence,

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:46.030
sexual abuse, one by
one, individual stories

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:50.290
begin to emerge as a
wave of experience that

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:54.830
lasted not just for generations
but millennia in a way.

00:45:54.830 --> 00:45:56.620
So the connection,
I think, between

00:45:56.620 --> 00:46:00.040
the individual experience
and the bigger story

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:04.420
is present whenever there's
an individual trauma.

00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:07.090
I don't go into this in the
book-- again, like I said,

00:46:07.090 --> 00:46:09.400
I had to choose
what I included--

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:13.340
but I know, for example,
in the gay community,

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:16.540
especially in the
community of people

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:21.250
who were exposed to AIDS
in the '80s and '90s,

00:46:21.250 --> 00:46:24.520
that there's actually a
syndrome that is referred

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:30.240
to as AIDS survivor syndrome.

00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:34.590
That people who lived and
had all of their friends

00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:38.070
die all around them but didn't
die for whatever reason--

00:46:38.070 --> 00:46:40.830
we're still trying
to study why did

00:46:40.830 --> 00:46:44.160
very few people who
were HIV-positive not

00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:45.870
succumb to AIDS.

00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:49.650
They have this
experience of, am I

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:53.100
fortunate or am I
hugely unfortunate

00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:57.480
that I've lost everyone I loved,
that I witnessed everyone's

00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:59.470
death and dying all around me?

00:46:59.470 --> 00:47:01.020
So that's another example.

00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:04.980
Also, just individual
experiences

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:07.800
of a suicide in the family.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:12.630
That can feel certainly like
an ongoing trauma in a family.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:14.910
And then, an individual
might look back

00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.610
at multi-generational
patterns in the family

00:47:17.610 --> 00:47:20.610
and see, oh, each
generation had a suicide.

00:47:20.610 --> 00:47:23.040
What does that mean?

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.930
We're just starting
to understand this.

00:47:24.930 --> 00:47:27.360
There's another term
you might come across

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.280
in addition to epigenetics.

00:47:29.280 --> 00:47:34.980
It's an acronym, ACEs,
Adverse Childhood Experiences.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.110
And pediatricians
and educators are

00:47:37.110 --> 00:47:41.640
starting to come up with a tool
for measuring when they meet

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.780
a young child and the child
is acting out behaviorally

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:47.970
in school or not
wanting to go to school

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:50.490
or there are crazy things
going on with the kid,

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:53.100
they'll ask the kid how
many of these things--

00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:57.270
or they're asking an
adult related to the kid--

00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:59.520
is there poverty in
the home, is there

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:01.800
someone incarcerated
in the family,

00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:04.320
is there mental
illness in the family,

00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:06.420
is there homelessness
in the family.

00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:10.620
And they calibrate and quantify
these adverse childhood

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:14.580
experiences and say a
score of such and such

00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:18.300
is likely to lead to
mental illness, health

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.590
problems, early death.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:23.400
So we're trying to intervene
at younger and younger ages

00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:27.840
now to recognize how even
individual traumas reverberate

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.020
throughout a culture
and a system.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:33.140
Does that answer your question?

00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:33.640
Thank you.

00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:34.600
Other questions?

00:48:38.860 --> 00:48:42.450
A comment is more
than welcome, too.

00:48:42.450 --> 00:48:43.666
Please.

00:48:43.666 --> 00:48:47.370
AUDIENCE: So when I see
[INAUDIBLE] what I actually

00:48:47.370 --> 00:48:52.860
see is that in the 1500s,
Japan invaded Korea,

00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:56.740
and they took thousands
of [INAUDIBLE] prisoner.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:01.110
Before that, most of the
peasants [INAUDIBLE] were good.

00:49:01.110 --> 00:49:06.900
And so, then, when I
actually see the [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:06.900 --> 00:49:11.400
I see the history of where
that actually came from.

00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:15.470
So we only see that as a
sign of reconciliation,

00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:21.180
but that itself actually has
hidden that history behind it.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:28.130
And when you mentioned Bosnia,
the Serbs, when it was going,

00:49:28.130 --> 00:49:31.260
there was a newspaper article
I read a long time ago,

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.200
in Serbia there is
actually a museum where

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.100
one of the things that was
displayed in the museum

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.700
is something that looks
like a tuning fork--

00:49:40.700 --> 00:49:43.580
tuning for, as in U-shaped.

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.060
Serbian people actually
had that tuning fork

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:52.010
because before the
Bosniaks were actually

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:56.020
gouging the eyes of the
Serbs using the fork.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:00.820
And so, when we actually
see history of genocide,

00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:02.960
it actually goes deeper.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.650
It's not just against
Serbs or Bosnians.

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:10.100
There's a deep history of a
vicious cycle that went on.

00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:14.420
And so we don't get to see
a lot of reconciliation

00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:16.520
throughout the history.

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:20.810
My recollection of the only
history of reconciliation

00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:25.070
was when I saw the recording
of Nelson Mandela being

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:27.890
interviewed after
his prison release.

00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:31.700
One of the first things
they said was, I forgive.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.810
And that literally made
me jump out of a chair

00:50:35.810 --> 00:50:39.140
because that's something
totally unexpected,

00:50:39.140 --> 00:50:43.725
but that actually gave hope
to the future of South Africa.

00:50:43.725 --> 00:50:50.180
That black people coming
into power in South Africa

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.250
wasn't going to be that bad
because here's the fighter who

00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:57.620
resisted apartheid
for such a long time

00:50:57.620 --> 00:51:03.230
and put under arrest
and prison life

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:04.910
coming out and saying
that he actually

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:08.680
forgave those perpetrators and
he's actually willing to work

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:11.320
with them for a better future.

00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:15.980
Unfortunately, those are very
rare occurrences in history.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:23.370
And now, what I'm seeing is
that I hear news about Syria

00:51:23.370 --> 00:51:26.130
where people are dying.

00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:27.930
Civilians are dying.

00:51:27.930 --> 00:51:32.610
And I hear about Yemen, where
there's a proxy war going on

00:51:32.610 --> 00:51:36.820
between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:41.005
And even in the States,
I like to travel,

00:51:41.005 --> 00:51:43.180
but probably the last
place I want to travel

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:47.440
is probably Alabama where
people were actually

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:52.020
rooting for Roy Moore in
this present day and age.

00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.880
So I have three kids.

00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.300
I want to leave a better
future for my kids.

00:51:58.300 --> 00:52:02.050
But at the same time,
I wonder, is the world

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:03.580
getting any better?

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.230
Has history taught
us any lessons?

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.130
Where do we end
this vicious cycle?

00:52:09.130 --> 00:52:14.950
How can a country, when
seemingly I'm in the minority

00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:19.610
and my voice is drowned
out, how do I reconcile it?

00:52:19.610 --> 00:52:22.670
And I was actually
coming to the TED Talk

00:52:22.670 --> 00:52:26.650
to hear a little bit of maybe--

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:28.300
I was looking for
some sort of a clue

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:33.340
as to how you were able
to find the reconciliation

00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:36.830
between the Germans
and the Nazis.

00:52:39.354 --> 00:52:41.270
ELIZABETH ROSNER: I don't
mean to cut you off.

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:42.353
We're running out of time.

00:52:42.353 --> 00:52:44.300
I want to say you
do have a voice.

00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:47.410
Your voice is really powerful
in what you've just been saying.

00:52:47.410 --> 00:52:51.760
And I do think that Mandela
is a beautiful example,

00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.890
a rare example.

00:52:53.890 --> 00:52:56.500
Forgiveness is not
necessarily something that

00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.930
can be flipped like a switch.

00:52:58.930 --> 00:53:03.940
It's incredibly rare that
somebody can even privately

00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:06.550
make a statement like that.

00:53:06.550 --> 00:53:09.430
But Germany is an
amazing exemplar

00:53:09.430 --> 00:53:13.360
right now, a model country
in taking responsibility

00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:17.380
for their history and preserving
it even when it shows them

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.450
in their worst light.

00:53:19.450 --> 00:53:25.330
And that gives me hope, that
Germans aren't saying bygones,

00:53:25.330 --> 00:53:29.560
let it be considered
history and we are no longer

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.760
obligated to remember.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:33.790
There was a time when
Germans said that,

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:36.520
and there are definitely
still Germans who say that.

00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.160
So I can't speak for every
German who is committed

00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:43.360
to this honest pathway.

00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.840
But reconciliation is a
goal, and it's very difficult

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:47.650
to achieve.

00:53:47.650 --> 00:53:49.270
And forgiveness,
I don't even know

00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:53.080
if that is a goal so much
as a form of justice.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:56.890
There's retribution,
and there's restoration.

00:53:56.890 --> 00:53:59.770
So retribution is
more where people

00:53:59.770 --> 00:54:03.910
want to take revenge and
see punishment meted out.

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:07.090
And restorative justice
is more a way of,

00:54:07.090 --> 00:54:10.900
saying let's at least
have the truth be told.

00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.760
And that's where you begin.

00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:16.690
And if forgiveness eventually
arises as a result,

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.660
that's good, but
not necessary maybe.

00:54:19.660 --> 00:54:26.690
So the complications in Asia,
the complications in Africa,

00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:31.880
there's a whole colonial
legacy underneath all of that.

00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:36.890
The Tutsis were raised up
by the European colonials,

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:38.510
and the Hutus were pushed down.

00:54:38.510 --> 00:54:44.000
So the Hutus have this long
history of feeling dehumanized,

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:44.900
disenfranchised.

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.440
So yes, they were acting out
of an old, old rage, too.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.290
And there were massacres by
Tutsis of Hutus, apparently.

00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:53.420
I'm learning now.

00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.360
The Armenian Genocide
is a long story,

00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.180
and Armenian Genocide is
a phrase you can't even

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.400
say aloud in Turkey.

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.470
It's illegal to say in Turkey.

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.080
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.750
Now, Poland is trying to
criminalize references

00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:14.440
to the Polish participation
in the Holocaust.

00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:19.540
So I think, to end on a
note that's complicated,

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:22.030
the worst of us
is getting worse,

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:25.510
and I hope that the best
of us is getting better.

00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:27.460
Thank you for your comment.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:29.470
Thank you all so
much for being here.

00:55:29.470 --> 00:55:32.860
I'm going to stick around for
a while if you want to talk.

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.780
Is our time up?

00:55:34.780 --> 00:55:36.201
We can keep going?

00:55:36.201 --> 00:55:36.700
No?

00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:39.144
We ended a long time ago.

00:55:39.144 --> 00:55:39.910
Haha.

00:55:39.910 --> 00:55:41.800
OK.

00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.740
Thank you so much.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.540
Thank you, Ezra.

00:55:43.540 --> 00:55:44.470
Thanks Google.

00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:46.440
Thank you all.
