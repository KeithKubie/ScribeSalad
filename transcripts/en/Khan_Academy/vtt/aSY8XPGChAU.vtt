00:00:00.472 --> 00:00:02.870
In the last video, we saw
how the Keynesian Cross

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.670
could help us visualize an increase in

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.691
government spending
which was a shift in our

00:00:07.691 --> 00:00:10.940
aggregate planned expenditure
line right over here

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.803
and we saw how the
actual change, the actual

00:00:13.803 --> 00:00:17.939
increase in output if you take all the

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.270
assumptions that we
took in this, the actual

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.274
change in output and
aggregate income was larger

00:00:23.274 --> 00:00:25.803
than the change in government spending.

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:28.539
You might say okay,
Keynesian thinking, this

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.400
is very left wing, this is the

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.356
government's growing larger right here.

00:00:32.356 --> 00:00:34.803
I'm more conservative.
I'm not a believer in

00:00:34.803 --> 00:00:36.206
Keynesian thinking.

00:00:36.206 --> 00:00:38.402
The reality is you actually might be.

00:00:38.402 --> 00:00:39.613
Whether you're on the right or the left,

00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:41.461
although Keynesian economics tends to be

00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:44.464
poo-pooed more by the
right and embraced more

00:00:44.464 --> 00:00:49.939
by the left, most of the
mainstream right policies,

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:51.692
especially in the US,
have actually been very

00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:52.691
Keynesian.

00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:54.207
They just haven't been
by manipulating this

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:56.000
variable right over here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.140
For example, when people
talk about expanding

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.400
the economy by lowering taxes, they are a

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.869
Keynesian when they say
that because if we were

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.077
to rewind and we go back to our original

00:01:06.077 --> 00:01:08.943
function so if we don't
do this, if we go back to

00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:15.560
just having our G here,
we're now back on this

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.223
orange line, our original
planned expenditure,

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:20.947
you could, based on this
model right over here,

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:23.873
also shift it up by lowering taxes.

00:01:23.873 --> 00:01:29.704
If you change your taxes to be taxes minus

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:33.471
some delta in taxes, the
reason why this is going

00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:35.460
to shift the whole curve
up is because you're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.204
multiplying this whole thing by a negative

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:41.666
number, by negative C1.

00:01:41.666 --> 00:01:43.709
C1, your marginal
propensity to consume, we're

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.006
assuming is positive.

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:46.872
There's a negative out here.

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:49.297
When you multiply it
by a negative, when you

00:01:49.297 --> 00:01:52.208
multiply a decrease by
a negative, this is a

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:56.126
negative change in taxes,
then this whole thing

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:58.299
is going to shift up again.

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.289
You would actually shift up.

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.954
You would actually shift
up in this case and

00:02:02.954 --> 00:02:05.139
depending on what the
actual magnitude of the

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:08.144
change in taxes are,
but you would actually

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:10.664
shift up and the amount
that you would shift up -

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.236
I don't want to make my graph to messy so

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:16.267
this is our new aggregate
planned expenditures -

00:02:16.267 --> 00:02:19.038
but the amount you
would move up is by this

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:24.542
coefficient down here, C1, -C1 x -delta T.

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:26.666
You're change, the amount
that you would move up,

00:02:26.666 --> 00:02:32.737
is -C1 x -delta T, if we assume delta T is

00:02:32.737 --> 00:02:37.873
positive and so you
actually have a C1, delta T.

00:02:37.873 --> 00:02:39.733
The negatives cancel out
so that's actually how

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:42.073
much it would actually move up.

00:02:42.073 --> 00:02:44.002
It's also Keynesian when you say if we

00:02:44.002 --> 00:02:46.473
increase taxes that will
lower aggregate output

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:51.267
because if you increase
taxes, now all of a

00:02:51.267 --> 00:02:54.751
sudden this is a positive,
this is a positive

00:02:54.751 --> 00:02:56.471
and then you would shift the curve by that

00:02:56.471 --> 00:02:57.475
much.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:59.875
You would actually
shift the curve down and

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:06.139
then you would get to a
lower equilibrium GDP.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.011
This really isn't a difference between

00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:12.902
right leaning fiscal
policy or left leaning

00:03:12.902 --> 00:03:14.713
fiscal policy and
everything I've talked about

00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:16.819
so far at the end of the
last video and this video

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.473
really has been fiscal policy.

00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:21.011
This has been the spending
lever of fiscal policy

00:03:21.011 --> 00:03:23.822
and this right over here
has been the taxing lever

00:03:23.822 --> 00:03:25.136
of fiscal policy.

00:03:25.136 --> 00:03:27.135
If you believe either of those can effect

00:03:27.135 --> 00:03:30.070
aggregate output, then you are essentially

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.206
subscribing to the Keynesian model.

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:35.802
Now one thing that I did
touch on a little bit

00:03:35.802 --> 00:03:38.791
in the last video is
whatever our change is,

00:03:38.791 --> 00:03:41.294
however much we shift
this aggregate planned

00:03:41.294 --> 00:03:44.958
expenditure curve, the
change in our output

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:47.368
actually was some multiple of that.

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.668
What I want to do now is
show you mathematically

00:03:49.668 --> 00:03:52.044
that it actually all works
out that the multiple is

00:03:52.044 --> 00:03:54.372
actually the multiplier.

00:03:54.372 --> 00:03:56.293
If we go back to our
original and this will just

00:03:56.293 --> 00:03:58.743
get a little bit mathy
right over here so I'm

00:03:58.743 --> 00:04:00.204
just going to rewrite it all.

00:04:00.204 --> 00:04:04.196
We have our planned
expenditure, just to redig

00:04:04.196 --> 00:04:07.289
our minds into the actual expression, the

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:08.619
planned expenditure is
equal to the marginal

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.941
propensity to consume
times aggregate income

00:04:12.941 --> 00:04:14.205
and then you're going to have all of this

00:04:14.205 --> 00:04:15.676
business right over here.

00:04:15.676 --> 00:04:16.872
We're just going to go
with the original one,

00:04:16.872 --> 00:04:18.000
not what I changed.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.210
All this business, let's just call this B.

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.621
That will just make it
simple for us to manipulate

00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:25.624
this so let's just call
of this business right

00:04:25.624 --> 00:04:26.624
over here B.

00:04:26.624 --> 00:04:28.933
We could substitute that back in later.

00:04:28.933 --> 00:04:33.161
We know that an economy is in equilibrium

00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:36.291
when planned expenditures
is equal to output.

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:39.473
That is an economy in
equilibrium so let's set this.

00:04:39.473 --> 00:04:43.439
Let's set planned expenditures equal to

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:45.471
aggregate output, which
is the same thing as

00:04:45.471 --> 00:04:46.957
aggregate expenditures, the same thing as

00:04:46.957 --> 00:04:49.211
aggregate income.

00:04:49.211 --> 00:04:52.705
We can just solve for
our equilibrium income.

00:04:52.705 --> 00:04:53.791
We can just solve for it.

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:59.740
You get Y=C1xY+B, this
is going to look very

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.203
familiar to you in a second.

00:05:01.203 --> 00:05:04.495
Subtract C1xY from both sides.

00:05:04.495 --> 00:05:08.044
Y-C1Y, that's the left-hand side now.

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:10.070
On the right-hand side,
obviously if we subtract

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.806
C1Y, it's going to go away
and that is equal to B.

00:05:14.806 --> 00:05:20.139
Then we can factor out
the aggregate income from

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:28.089
this, so Yx1-C1=B and
then we divide both sides

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:34.945
by 1-C1 and we get, that cancels out.

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.289
I'll write it right over here.

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:41.794
We get, a little bit of
a drum roll, aggregate

00:05:41.794 --> 00:05:45.603
income, our equilibrium, aggregate income,

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:47.775
aggregate output.

00:05:47.775 --> 00:05:57.072
GDP is going to be equal to 1/1-C1xB.

00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:59.729
Remember B was all this business up here.

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.873
Now what is this?

00:06:01.873 --> 00:06:03.287
You might remember this
or if you haven't seen

00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:04.737
the video, you might
want to watch the video

00:06:04.737 --> 00:06:06.012
on the multiplier.

00:06:06.012 --> 00:06:08.496
This C1 right over here is our marginal

00:06:08.496 --> 00:06:12.090
propensity to consume.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:14.620
1 minus our marginal propensity to consume

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:15.806
is actually - And I
don't think I've actually

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:18.041
referred to it before which
let me rewrite it here

00:06:18.041 --> 00:06:21.292
just so that you know the
term - so C1 is equal to

00:06:21.292 --> 00:06:25.855
our marginal propensity to consume.

00:06:25.855 --> 00:06:29.994
For example, if this is
30% or 0.3, that means

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:31.873
for every incremental dollar of disposable

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:34.954
income I get, I want to spend $.30 of it.

00:06:34.954 --> 00:06:38.958
Now 1-C1, you could view
this as your marginal

00:06:38.958 --> 00:06:41.678
propensity to save.

00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:44.292
If I'm going to spend
30%, that means I'm going

00:06:44.292 --> 00:06:46.333
to save 70%.

00:06:46.333 --> 00:06:48.600
This is just saying
I'm going to save 1-C1.

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.739
If I'm spending 30% of that incremental

00:06:50.739 --> 00:06:54.802
disposable dollar, then I'm
going to save 70% of it.

00:06:54.802 --> 00:06:56.470
This whole thing, this is the marginal

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.536
propensity to consume.

00:06:57.536 --> 00:07:00.545
This entire denominator
is the marginal propensity

00:07:00.545 --> 00:07:06.138
to save and then one over
that, so 1/1-C1 which

00:07:06.138 --> 00:07:08.544
is the the same thing
as 1/marginal propensity

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:11.136
to save, that is the multiplier.

00:07:11.136 --> 00:07:12.475
We saw that a few videos ago.

00:07:12.475 --> 00:07:14.207
If you take this infinite
geometric series,

00:07:14.207 --> 00:07:16.203
if we just think through
how money spends, if I

00:07:16.203 --> 00:07:19.287
spend some money on some
good or service, the

00:07:19.287 --> 00:07:21.291
person who has that
money as income is going

00:07:21.291 --> 00:07:23.536
to spend some fraction
of it based on their

00:07:23.536 --> 00:07:25.739
marginal propensity to
consume and we're assuming

00:07:25.739 --> 00:07:27.802
that it's constant
throughout the economy at all

00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:30.909
income levels for this
model right over here.

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.612
Then they'll spend some
of it and then the person

00:07:33.612 --> 00:07:35.000
that they spend it on,
they're going to spend

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.803
some fraction.

00:07:35.803 --> 00:07:38.288
When you keep adding all
that infinite series up,

00:07:38.288 --> 00:07:41.749
you actually get this
multiplier right over here.

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:48.738
This is equal to our multiplier.

00:07:48.738 --> 00:07:54.408
For example, if B gets
shifted up by any amount,

00:07:54.408 --> 00:07:57.316
let's say B gets shifted
up and it could get

00:07:57.316 --> 00:07:59.138
shifted up by changes in any of this stuff

00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:00.076
right over here.

00:08:00.076 --> 00:08:01.789
Net exports can change,
planned investments

00:08:01.789 --> 00:08:04.397
can change, could be shifted up or down.

00:08:04.397 --> 00:08:08.627
The impact on GDP is
going to be whatever that

00:08:08.627 --> 00:08:12.425
shift is times the multiplier.

00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.733
We saw it before.

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:23.190
If, for example, if C1=0.6, that means for

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.806
every incremental disposable
dollar, people will

00:08:25.806 --> 00:08:27.209
spend 60% of it.

00:08:27.209 --> 00:08:31.773
That means that the
marginal propensity to save

00:08:31.773 --> 00:08:33.871
is equal to 40%.

00:08:33.871 --> 00:08:36.137
They're going to save
40% of any incremental

00:08:36.137 --> 00:08:42.233
disposable dollar and
then the multiplier is

00:08:42.233 --> 00:08:45.806
going to be one over
that, is going to be 1/0.4

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:48.192
which is the same thing
as one over two-fifths,

00:08:48.192 --> 00:08:51.292
which is the same thing
as five-halves, which

00:08:51.292 --> 00:08:53.959
is the same thing as 2.5.

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:58.190
For example, in this
situation, we just saw that

00:08:58.190 --> 00:09:01.876
Y, the equilibrium Y is
going to be 2.5 times

00:09:01.876 --> 00:09:04.407
whatever all of this other business is.

00:09:04.407 --> 00:09:08.043
If we change B by, let's
say, $1 billion and

00:09:08.043 --> 00:09:12.211
maybe if we increase B by $1 billion.

00:09:12.211 --> 00:09:14.536
We might increase B by
$1 billion by increasing

00:09:14.536 --> 00:09:17.314
government spending by $1
billion or maybe having

00:09:17.314 --> 00:09:20.294
this whole term including
this negative right

00:09:20.294 --> 00:09:24.470
over here become less
negative by $1 billion.

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:26.204
Maybe we have planned
investment increase by

00:09:26.204 --> 00:09:29.010
$1 billion and that could
actually be done a little

00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:31.036
bit with tax policy too
by letting companies

00:09:31.036 --> 00:09:33.074
maybe depreciate their assets faster.

00:09:33.074 --> 00:09:35.743
If we could increase net
exports by $1 billion.

00:09:35.743 --> 00:09:38.804
Essentially any way that we
increase B by $1 billion,

00:09:38.804 --> 00:09:44.181
that'll increase GDP by
$2.5 billion, 2.5 times

00:09:44.181 --> 00:09:45.375
our change in B.

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:48.003
We can write this down this way.

00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:54.140
Our change in Y is going
to be 2.5 times our

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.471
change in B.

00:09:55.471 --> 00:09:56.873
Another way to think
about it when you write

00:09:56.873 --> 00:09:59.733
the expression like
this, if you said Y is a

00:09:59.733 --> 00:10:02.073
function of B, then you
would say look the slope

00:10:02.073 --> 00:10:08.027
is 2.5, so change in Y over change in B is

00:10:08.027 --> 00:10:11.110
equal to 2.5, but I just
wanted to right this

00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:12.339
to show you that this isn't some magical

00:10:12.339 --> 00:10:13.804
voodoo that we're doing.

00:10:13.804 --> 00:10:15.958
This is what we looked at
visually when we looked

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:17.043
at the Keynesian Cross.

00:10:17.043 --> 00:10:19.628
This is really just describing the same

00:10:19.628 --> 00:10:22.803
multiplier effect that
we saw in previous videos

00:10:22.803 --> 00:10:26.803
and where we actually derived
the actual multiplier.
