to the question

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610
to the question
 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.990
to the question
why only 20 times that's all I can find

social behavior and why is this and now
 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.680
social behavior and why is this and now
I'm going to tell you and this is a very

I'm going to tell you and this is a very
 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.520
I'm going to tell you and this is a very
