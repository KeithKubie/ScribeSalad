00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.059
 hi i'm navy grandson of team see it 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.380
 by google slickness and in the episode of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.809
 today should bytes 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.060
 Let's see how the navigation tags in the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.949
 your android app quite 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.039
 navigation are a widely used feature 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.000
 since the early versions of android 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.699
 used very well by the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 applications are generally available and 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.349
 then with the action bar the form of 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.570
 to set up the inauguration date was a 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.820
 his appearance was also slightly altered. 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.540
 reused to integrate better know 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.430
 a pub 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.809
 if you do not know is to hit what? 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.059
 learn how to implement your 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.710
 application has a link in the video that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.379
 Can you see an episode we did? 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.030
 discussions on use of the action 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.440
 neighborhood 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.719
 we have some types of action on va 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.680
 which has different deployments and uses 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.750
 different 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.850
 in the case here first it is the slaves 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.199
 or tevez you can use anchored to 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.640
 also move to the other of 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.820
 side is to make the movement of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.890
 Sweetie, you run your finger across the board. 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.570
 the example image in the case here is of the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.119
 google places and can change 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.610
 categories available only 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.470
 making a move with the finger exchanging 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.540
 from one page to another that facilitates 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.350
 very much the skill and experience of the 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.869
 user 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.360
 then the fixed telephones that are the most 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.799
 used it is worth remembering that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.810
 there must be a smaller number of tags 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.890
 because you do not follow too much 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.920
 interface 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 But it stays and integrates well with the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.180
 use the action bar after we have the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.490
 tags stacked in the case when you 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.950
 has for example I was here on the screen is 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.530
 where I have vertically the tags the part 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.540
 from below and horizontally the teles will 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 for the top are on the side logo 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.729
 the only one of your application this way 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.110
 making better use of screen space without 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.680
 that you care a lot about it in the 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.210
 code can assemble the layout you will have 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 some special care that may 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.500
 implement navigation tags 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.540
 the first thing your layout has to contain 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.090
 a group virus where it will be 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:06.000
 fragments with content will be associated 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.680
 to this tag and remember that you set edp 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.080
 civil group so you can in your 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.629
 code identify easy which one did you see this 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.710
 replaces content in the correct form 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.080
 Besides that 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.820
 if you are going to use the entire screen to 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.740
 view the content until you 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.660
 create a new group 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.820
 you can use android account r 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.060
 points as there were 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.450
 ruth and put all the content straight there 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.430
 and how the implement then tog 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.590
 navigation or a peek in the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.080
 people can make their implementation 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.420
 the first thing is a class that 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.700
 implement interface action a boat 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.540
 had list, which is the class responsible 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.370
 for receiving the events is by cauby tech 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.900
 of his thesis the user clicks on a 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.910
 technique that molds until then has to 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.240
 call this class that will change the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.100
 content or upgrade and in addition to 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.900
 every time you want to create you 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.750
 will create an instance of action bar 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.010
 tab and set the table list that 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.500
 You implemented what we talked about in a 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.580
 previous step calling method 7 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.560
 enable 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.470
 and finally after you create a tag 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.830
 added list you add tab action 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.840
 neighborhood through the method is tagged as 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.730
 A little glance now then how to make the 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.710
 implementation of this in the code 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.210
 even we have here the android manifest 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.470
 I would like to remind you if as already 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.330
 was said to have to implement that 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.240
 so I put the theme here 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.040
 as it fears point is compact light but if 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.820
 Can you understand what time you are? 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.860
 want to 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.660
 to be able to implement 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.080
 to begin here then by the feminist 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.420
 the class that implements interface action 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.850
 accountant who will take care of 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.840
 codecs when the user clicks matter 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.790
 go to another 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.580
 the consultant receives an asset of 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.190
 assets that have tags a tag to 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.920
 to identify each tebe every weak is 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.690
 displayed and finally the class fragments that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.460
 is displayed with the content 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.500
 in the first half is seeing here that is 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.840
 of kardec or a select park of or 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.240
 when a selected board 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.370
 People here try to get through the 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.010
 probably less support that talking 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.780
 only by the tag you pass the constructor 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.580
 if it is null or has not yet been 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.070
 displayed was not created I wanted a 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.359
 new instance and replays in content 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.760
 that it is displayed 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.650
 if it had already been created, I already 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.230
 I am simply of the attic or 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.860
 resumes displaying the content on the web but 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.629
 when you have a method yesterday 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.969
 a select because if a table is 

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:32.889
 selected, the other has to be 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:34.990
 then everyone should always 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:36.009
 you click on a strip a selection and 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.469
 puts another 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.810
 in this case I check if it is null 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:42.550
 panther landino tip and then if he does not 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.189
 whether it was not null and simply 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.539
 tete or remove it from the 

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:48.729
 screen display 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:52.599
 but how am I going to use this guy with 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.180
 the panamera tivit tags I'll then have 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:57.849
 here I'm going to get a boat and remembering 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.919
 integrated with edson bar and you're 19 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:02.020
 Complaining 79 Geisha Trade Template 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.330
 mold for action one bar point 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.039
 navigation template indicating 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.689
 However, all tags with the 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:09.849
 browsing your app 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:11.830
 after that I create each TV in case 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.580
 has an artist tag and a tag 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:17.020
 album and set list with seven stabilizes 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.900
 It's because it was clear that you just showed 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:22.419
 what you used and then with that 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.939
 to finish sent the ad that goes 

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:26.620
 show within the appropriate content 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:28.509
 let's take a look then how 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:34.270
 this result of this implementation 

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:36.610
 here I have here then our 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.949
 content with two tevez 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.870
 the artist uses some and has collected click 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:43.360
 here you see that it replaced content 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.219
 from one tag to another and so you can 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.659
 use the blatant a way well 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.550
 interesting in the next episodes 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:50.979
 Let's show you how you can improve. 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.719
 even more your experience the annexes 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:54.909
 a bar so you already know how isaac 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:58.259
 Chumbar and now the new Tevez Geishas 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:58.259
 until the next staff
