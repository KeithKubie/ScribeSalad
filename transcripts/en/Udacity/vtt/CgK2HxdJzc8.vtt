[SOUND] Hi, I'm Lyla Fujiwara.

00:00:04.687 --> 00:00:06.623
I'm a course developer
here at Udacity and

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:09.670
these are my thoughts
on crappy interviews.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.470
So this is kind of funny
because interviews are like

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.360
a little bit the bane of my existence.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.165
I'm sort of like, I've thought
about this story a little bit but

00:00:17.165 --> 00:00:20.486
I'm shaking a little bit right now just
because I'm being asked a question.

00:00:20.486 --> 00:00:25.210
In my senior year, a lot of people
were applying to go work in big

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.311
tech companies and
I was sort of thinking about it, but

00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:34.126
I wasn't quite sure what I wanted
to do with the rest of my life and

00:00:34.126 --> 00:00:37.780
sort of one of the things
in my mind was like well,

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.115
I have this very clear path for
what I can do.

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:42.060
I'm going to have this degree.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.890
It could probably get me into like
a really nice tech company and

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.080
I could just keep doing what I'm doing,
but at the time I was a little bit,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.890
you know, just questioning
if that's what I wanted.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:57.135
Anyways, I had TAed for this professor
who's actually a leader in graphics,

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:02.490
the field of graphics and had been a TA
from one of his larger classes and

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.510
I think this is what got me on
sort of the short list for a list

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.222
of students that a large tech company
was particularly trying to recruit.

00:01:11.222 --> 00:01:16.575
So I got this invite and I kind of
like didn't respond for a while and

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:21.082
I'm like whatever free trip
out to the West Coast.

00:01:21.082 --> 00:01:24.672
So I did it, I went there and
I got put in,

00:01:24.672 --> 00:01:29.761
it was either my first or
my second technical interview.

00:01:29.761 --> 00:01:33.996
And technical interviews are super
stressful [LAUGH] I feel like,

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:37.260
partially just because there's so
exhausting.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.645
They're ten hour ordeals, or
at least this one was, and

00:01:40.645 --> 00:01:43.500
you're being bused around and
meeting all the different teams.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.646
And I remember early in the morning
of that interview, talking to

00:01:48.646 --> 00:01:53.470
a guy who was super friendly and I was
having a good conversation with him,

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:58.570
but we were talking about printer
drivers and in the back of my head while

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.630
I'm trying to answer questions from
this guy, I'm thinking, printer drivers.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.182
That's the most boring thing
I can ever think of and

00:02:06.182 --> 00:02:10.351
I talked to some other people
during that interview experience.

00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:14.452
There's a part that I don't remember
quite how I flubbed it, but

00:02:14.452 --> 00:02:18.852
I was talking to a guy about how a web
page was put together with how it's

00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:23.402
actually parsed on a server and I had
no idea how that was actually done and

00:02:23.402 --> 00:02:26.860
he was getting kind of
frustrated with me or whatever.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.550
But I got far along in the process, so
I was feeling pretty good of myself and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.760
like, I just really breezed
through this interview.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.830
Yeah sure, I messed up some things with
a seed graph, and a web server, or

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.350
something, but I'll be fine.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.110
And about a week later,
I got a phone call saying,

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.420
which is probably fairly obvious to you,
that I didn't get the job and

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.251
I was kind of sitting there and
feeling really sorry for myself.

00:02:56.251 --> 00:03:02.990
But I think the thing
that I got out of it and

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.314
kind of what I want to convey
I guess to Udacity students is

00:03:07.314 --> 00:03:13.050
that I wasn't really supposed
to be at that interview.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.950
That job wasn't something that I
was particularly interested in.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:24.030
I didn't really take ownership for
the job application process.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.909
And so actually what I did end up doing
was instead of going off and working

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:34.220
with a big tech company, I went into the
Peace Corps and I taught for two years.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.330
And after coming back from the Peace
Corps in a similar thing, I say I should

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.560
apply to these large tech companies
who do the whole interview process.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.080
But one of the things that I did
differently the second time around, was

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.381
in a dusty Kenyan market,
I bought this book called

00:03:50.381 --> 00:03:55.980
What Color Is Your Parachute, which is
a quintessential career guidance book.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.190
And one of the sort of silly
things that it made me do was walk

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.130
through a series of exercises to learn
about what actually is important to you,

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.070
what you're interested in more than
just you what your skillset is or

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.940
what you happenned to
get your degree in.

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.937
And through doing that, I was a lot
better able to verbalize what I wanted.

00:04:15.937 --> 00:04:20.690
And as I was going through the job
search, I didn't apply to a lot of jobs

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.492
which on paper looked kind of good,
if I got hired there,

00:04:24.492 --> 00:04:28.610
it would be a good thing to brag
to my family and friends about or

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.994
whatever, but they weren't jobs
I was actually interested in.

00:04:32.994 --> 00:04:37.127
And the first job that I applied for was
Udacity and I read the job description,

00:04:37.127 --> 00:04:40.897
and I went this is perfect, this is
awesome and this is where I want to be.
