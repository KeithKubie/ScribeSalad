00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.136
[smooth jazz playing]

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:05.938
- WASN'T THAT THE TURN
FOR OUR POLLING STATION?

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:08.040
- WHY, NO, YOUNG MAN.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.577
UH, SEE, WE--WE KNOW
A SHORTER ROUTE TO YOUR--

00:00:11.577 --> 00:00:14.080
TO OUR DEMOCRATIC
POLLING STATION.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.248
- YOU KNOW HOW US DEMOCRATS
LIKE A SHORTCUT,

00:00:16.248 --> 00:00:18.918
LIKE GOVERNMENT SPENDING
TO PROP UP THE ECONOMY.

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:22.822
- THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE LOVE
THAN THOSE FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.557
- YOU TWO ARE DEMOCRATS,
AREN'T YOU?

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:25.625
- WHAT?

00:00:25.625 --> 00:00:27.193
[both laugh]

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.495
- OF COURSE WE ARE.

00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:30.229
- YOU SEE THE COLOR OF OUR SKIN,
DON'T YOU?

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.565
HOW COULD WE
NOT BLINDLY VOTE DEMOCRATIC?

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.200
- I MEAN,
THAT WOULD BE RIDICULOUS.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.668
- WHATEVER.

00:00:35.668 --> 00:00:37.136
ALL I KNOW IS MY POLLING PLACE
CLOSES IN 15 MINUTES.

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.938
- WHY, THAT WOULD BE TERRIBLE.
- AWFUL.

00:00:38.938 --> 00:00:41.307
I MEAN, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO
ELECT TAX-AND-SPEND POLITICIANS

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:43.042
IF YOU CAN'T VOTE?

00:00:43.042 --> 00:00:46.378
- IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO VOTE
WITH ALL THOSE VOTER I.D. LAWS.

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:47.814
- REPUBLICANS.
- ARGH!

00:00:47.814 --> 00:00:51.150
THOSE GOSH-DARN REPUBLICANS.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.920
- I KNOW. I'M JUST LIKE, "GRR!"
- YEAH, TEN AND TWO, DOUGLAS.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.421
- RIGHT.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.457
IF THERE WERE ANY REPUBLICANS
HERE, WHOA-HO-HO-OH,

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.158
I'D BE PISSED.

00:00:59.158 --> 00:01:00.760
I'D BE ROYALLY PISSED.
- ME TOO. ME TOO.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.096
- IN FACT, I WOULD TAKE
THEIR HARD-FOUGHT PRINCIPLES,

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.531
AND I'D SHOVE IT
RIGHT UP THEIR KEISTERS.

00:01:05.531 --> 00:01:06.966
- OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:10.203
- WE SEEM TO BE DRIVING
IN CIRCLES.

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:13.006
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

00:01:13.006 --> 00:01:14.307
[tires screech]

00:01:14.307 --> 00:01:17.343
- LOOK, IT APPEARS
WE'VE HIT SOMEBODY.

00:01:17.343 --> 00:01:19.411
WE SHOULD GET OUT AND HELP HIM.

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.848
- OH!
OH, MY LEG!

00:01:21.848 --> 00:01:22.916
OH, MY LEG.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:24.450
- OOPSY DAISY. OOPSY DAISY.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.252
- HERE YOU GO.

00:01:26.252 --> 00:01:27.853
- I AM PISSED.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:29.955
I AM ROYALLY PISSED.

00:01:29.955 --> 00:01:32.859
NOW, ALTHOUGH IT WAS ONLY
THIS ONE MAN'S FAULT,

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:35.228
I WILL BE USING
ALL OF YOUR TAX DOLLARS

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.796
TO GET HEALTHY,

00:01:36.796 --> 00:01:38.831
THANKS TO THE AFFORDABLE
HEALTHCARE ACT.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:40.366
- I KNOW IT DOESN'T SEEM FAIR,

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.935
BUT THAT'S SUPPOSEDLY THE LAW
OF THE LAND NOWADAYS.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.438
- THAT'S WHAT I'VE HEARD.
- YOU DON'T LOOK THAT HURT.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.940
- WHY Y'ALL WEARING
THOSE SAME LEATHER JACKETS

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.242
AND THOSE DAD JEANS?

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.977
- DISPERSE!

00:01:55.448 --> 00:01:56.883
[woman gasps]

00:01:56.883 --> 00:01:59.016
- BLACK REPUBLICAN
MOTHER[bleep]!
