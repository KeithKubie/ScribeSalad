00:00:00.634 --> 00:00:02.514
 Farmer Jen is a vegetable grower 

00:00:02.514 --> 00:00:04.998
 and divides the land he owns into broccoli 

00:00:04.998 --> 00:00:06.531
 and spinach. 

00:00:06.531 --> 00:00:10.083
 Last year he grew up 

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:12.869
 6 tons of broccoli per acre 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:15.748
 and 9 tons of spinach 

00:00:15.748 --> 00:00:17.931
 by acre, 

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:21.414
 of a total of 93 tons of vegetables. 

00:00:21.414 --> 00:00:24.966
 This year he grew up 

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:29.169
 2 tons of broccoli per acre 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.559
 and 3 tons of spinach 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.229
 by acre 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:38.458
 of a total of 31 tons of vegetables. 

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:41.800
 How many acres of broccoli and how many acres 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.028
 with spinach farmer Jen? 

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:46.467
 Let's think about it. 

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:51.042
 The number of acres with broccoli 

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.385
 we will denote by B, 

00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:57.589
 and the acres with spinach 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.537
 we will indicate with S. 

00:01:01.537 --> 00:01:04.811
 How many broccoli he raised over them, 

00:01:04.811 --> 00:01:07.388
 say last year? 

00:01:07.388 --> 00:01:09.385
 Last year how many broccoli did you raise? 

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.576
 Let's save it. 

00:01:11.576 --> 00:01:15.019
 Last year. 

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:19.241
 It is told us that last year he raised 6 tons 

00:01:19.241 --> 00:01:21.453
 broccoli from acre land. 

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.914
 If he raised 6 tons of broccoli per acre 

00:01:23.914 --> 00:01:25.935
 and has B acres, 

00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:29.860
 this will be 6 tons 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.903
 on B acres. 

00:01:31.903 --> 00:01:36.499
 He raised 6B tonnes of broccoli last year. 

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.262
 And by the same logic, how much spinach did you raise? 

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:45.022
 9 tonnes of sparkling acres per acre. 

00:01:45.022 --> 00:01:49.311
 9S tons of spinach. 

00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:51.957
 We also have a total of 93 tons, 

00:01:51.957 --> 00:01:55.534
 we have a total of 93 tons of vegetables. 

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:59.132
 This will be equal to 93. 

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:01.315
 Let's look at them this year. 

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.892
 In general, when you decide on the task, do the following: 

00:02:03.892 --> 00:02:05.889
 established variables altogether 

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.405
 for what you are looking for, and then look 

00:02:07.405 --> 00:02:10.181
 how can you use the information given to us? 

00:02:10.181 --> 00:02:13.477
 This year how many broccoli did he raise? 

00:02:13.477 --> 00:02:16.542
 2 tons of broccoli 

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:19.701
 by acre. 

00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:22.673
 It has the same number of acres. We can assume it is. 

00:02:22.673 --> 00:02:24.785
 2 tons per acre on B acres 

00:02:24.785 --> 00:02:28.106
 will be 2B tonnes of broccoli. 

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.242
 And by the same logic we will have, 

00:02:30.242 --> 00:02:32.610
 that he had raised 3 tons of spinach per acre. 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.283
 There is S acre. 

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:36.651
 Grows 3 tons 

00:02:36.651 --> 00:02:41.017
 spinach from each acre, we will have 3S tons of spinach. 

00:02:41.017 --> 00:02:42.827
 And we are told how many vegetables we have in common. 

00:02:42.827 --> 00:02:47.395
 We have a total of 31 tons of vegetables. 

00:02:47.395 --> 00:02:50.112
 This will be equal to 31. 

00:02:50.112 --> 00:02:52.456
 We received a system of two equations 

00:02:52.456 --> 00:02:56.962
 with two unknowns that we can use to find B and S. 

00:02:56.962 --> 00:03:00.026
 What do we want to find first? 

00:03:00.026 --> 00:03:03.787
 What we can do, let me transcribe the above equation. 

00:03:03.787 --> 00:03:07.028
 We have 6B plus, 

00:03:07.868 --> 00:03:12.261
 plus 9S is equal 

00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:15.321
 of 93. 

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:16.299
 And the second equation, 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.084
 let's try to eliminate B. 

00:03:20.084 --> 00:03:24.326
 Let's multiply the second equation by minus 3. 

00:03:24.326 --> 00:03:27.791
 I will multiply the left side by minus 3 

00:03:27.791 --> 00:03:30.253
 and I will multiply the right side too 

00:03:30.253 --> 00:03:31.623
 minus 3. 

00:03:31.623 --> 00:03:34.014
 What do I get? 

00:03:34.014 --> 00:03:37.335
 Minus 3 at 2B is minus 6B. 

00:03:37.335 --> 00:03:38.914
 That's why we've multiplied it 

00:03:38.914 --> 00:03:40.585
 minus 3. 

00:03:40.585 --> 00:03:44.685
 Minus 3 at 3S is minus 9S, 

00:03:44.685 --> 00:03:46.242
 minus 9S. 

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:51.140
 And then minus 3 at 31 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.159
 will be minus 93. 

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.688
 What we get if we now get together 

00:03:57.688 --> 00:03:59.477
 of the equations? 

00:03:59.477 --> 00:04:02.612
 On the left side, 6B minus 6B is 0. 

00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:06.117
 9S minus 9S, this is also 0. We will only get 0. 

00:04:06.117 --> 00:04:10.296
 On the right side we get 93 minus 93. 

00:04:10.296 --> 00:04:13.454
 This will also be 0. 

00:04:13.454 --> 00:04:16.356
 This is the case where we get 0 is equal to 0, 

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.421
 which will be true no matter what x and y are. 

00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:22.092
 This system is 

00:04:22.092 --> 00:04:23.253
 with an infinite number of decisions. 

00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:26.482
 It has infinite, 

00:04:27.592 --> 00:04:31.655
 an infinite number of decisions. 

00:04:31.655 --> 00:04:33.491
 We can say, 

00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:34.861
 that these two conditions 

00:04:34.861 --> 00:04:37.460
 do not give us enough information. 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.317
 There are an infinite number of combinations of B and S, 

00:04:40.317 --> 00:04:42.987
 which will satisfy these equations, 

00:04:42.987 --> 00:04:45.565
 so we have not been given enough information, 

00:04:45.565 --> 00:04:50.325
 to say exactly how much B and S. 

00:04:50.325 --> 00:04:53.617
 Not enough 

00:04:53.617 --> 00:04:56.495
 information! 

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.492
 I will put an exclamation mark there.
