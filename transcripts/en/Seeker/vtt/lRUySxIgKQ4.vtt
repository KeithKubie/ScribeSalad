00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.440
There is a lot coming in
space exploration this year,

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.810
big things, small things,
and space sailing.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.560
You do not want to miss 2014.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.620
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.120
Hey, all.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.030
Welcome to our first weekly
DNews space update of 2014.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.810
I'm Trace.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.090
Space exploration
takes a long while.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.280
And during this
trip around the sun

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.850
our tiny planet is
heading out into the stars

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.560
in new and exciting ways.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.760
My third favorite
space mission of 2014

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.630
has to be space
tourism in general.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.620
The successes of private space
companies in the last few years

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.280
has created quite the visible
push for Virgin Galactic

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.860
to get their passengers'
butts up into the blackness.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.600
Last September, Virgin
Galactic got off

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.000
the ground with its
final test flights.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.550
600 people are already on
the list at $250 K a pop,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.810
so they better get in
gear, especially now

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.380
that SpaceX and Orbital
Sciences are launching missions

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.080
to the ISS today and next week.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.080
Come on, Branson, I want
to get up there too.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:00:59.950
Let's fly.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.380
Second is the Sunjammer.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.370
On the ground, it
doesn't look like much.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.370
But it's a satellite unlike
any we've ever launched before.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.850
Riding a SpaceX Falcon
9 rocket, the Sunjammer

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.440
is a solar sail boat.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.450
See, the sun is constantly
throwing photon particles

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.110
into space.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.340
And though each individual
photon is tiny, all of them

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.290
together press with a constant
nine newtons of force.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.880
And that's called
the solar wind.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670
The Sunjammer has
a sail on board,

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.060
packed into about the
size of a dishwasher.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.270
But once deployed, its
3,000 square foot sail

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940
will gather that solar wind.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.000
And boom!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.050
Space travel.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.600
It's set to drop a
satellite or two.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.810
But it is also going to
prove solar sails are

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.170
a viable method of
constant propulsion,

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.310
without on board rocket fuel.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.480
Imagine ancient humans sailing
the seas, but in space.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.149
That's genius.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.940
The biggest thing I'm
excited for this year

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.090
is the test launch of
NASA's Orion spacecraft,

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.660
the next generation of
human-carrying, reusable space

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.430
launch vehicles.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.130
The plan is for
Orion to take humans

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.300
to asteroids, the moon, Mars,
and other deep space missions.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.150
It's been described
as Apollo on steroids.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.710
That's not strictly
speaking true.

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.180
They took the Saturn
V from Apollo,

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.080
and then they made
it 30% bigger,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.800
and then rebuilt
everything else.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.380
The thing is going to
pack a whole wallop.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.760
And they're going to launch
the full system, unmanned,

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.400
for a complete test
later this year.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.920
Orion is set to have the fastest
reentry we have ever done.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.740
And it's going to go
further out into space

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.890
than any human spaceflight
vehicle since 1972.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.617
This is going to
be big all over.

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:29.700
What are you excited about
for this year in space?

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.932
I'm sure you can tell us.

00:02:30.932 --> 00:02:32.140
Just go down in the comments.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.723
Thanks, a lot for
watching, everybody.

00:02:33.723 --> 00:02:36.350
And we'll see you next Friday
for a weekly space update.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.400
