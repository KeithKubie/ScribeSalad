00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.390
Let's try to subtract
164 from 301,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.380
and I encourage you
to pause this video

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.370
and try it on your own first.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.930
So let's go place
by place, and we

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.450
can realize where we have to do
some borrowing or regrouping.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.440
So in the ones place,
we have an issue.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.080
4 is larger than 1.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.660
How do we subtract a larger
number from a smaller number?

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.430
We also an issue
in the tens place.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.300
6 is larger than 0.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.840
How do we subtract 6 from 0?

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.170
So the answer that might
be jumping into your head

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.930
is oh, we've got to do some
borrowing or some regrouping.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.160
But then you might be
facing another problem.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.881
You'd say, OK, well, let's try
to borrow from the tens place

00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:36.380
here.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.160
So we have a 1.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.870
If we could borrow 10 from the
tens place, it could be 11.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.890
But there's nothing
here in the tens place.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.040
There's nothing to
borrow, so what do we do?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.000
So the way I would
tackle it is first

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.070
borrow for the tens place.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.360
So we have nothing here,
so let's regroup 100

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.220
from the hundreds place.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.100
So that's equivalent
to borrowing a 1

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.230
from the hundreds place.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.940
So that's now a 2.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.940
And now in the tens
place, instead of a 0,

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.420
we are going to have a 10.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.610
Now, let's make sure that
this still makes sense.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.480
This is 200 plus 10 tens.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.250
10 tens is 100, plus 1.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.100
200 plus 100 plus
1 is still 301.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.730
So this still makes sense.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.270
Now, the reason why
this is valuable

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.430
is now we have something to
regroup from the tens place.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.670
If we take one of these tens,
so now we're left with 9 tens,

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.980
and we give it to the ones
place, so you give 10 plus 1,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.860
you're going to be left with 11.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.900
And we can verify that
we still haven't changed

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.180
the value of the actual number.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.160
200 plus 90 is 290,
plus 11 is still 301.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.890
And what was neat about
this is now up here,

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.100
all of these numbers are larger
than the corresponding number

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.560
in the same place.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.620
So we're ready to subtract.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:09.199
11 minus 4 is-- let's see, 10
minus 3 is 7, so 11 minus 4

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.030
is 7.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.220
9 minus 6 is 3,
and 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.890
So we are left with 137.
