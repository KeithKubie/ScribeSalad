00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
I'm guessing you probably figured out that gamma was still 1.25, since Î² was still 0.6.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
But you may have tried to divide by gamma instead of multiply, 8 seconds by 1.25

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
because the correct answer really is 10.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Now, you may be asking--I thought when 8 seconds corresponded to 10 down here

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
does not mean fewer seconds corresponds to more seconds?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
How could it be the case that when I'm in this spaceship my friends waving every 8 seconds

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
10 seconds elapsed on my clock.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
It's not a problem with the clocks. This is an inherit part of special relativity.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It's something you will learn much more about as you take more courses.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Unfortunately, today is just a teaser.

00:00:39.000 --> 99:59:59.000
If you want to read more, I suggest you look at the twin paradox and other links below this video.
