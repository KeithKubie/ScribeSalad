00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:09.970
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, welcome everyone. Today
we are very fortunate to have three big-name

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.230
Bay Area sports journalists with us. [chuckles]
Closest to me, we have King Kaufman, who spent

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:24.909
several years at Salon.com and is currently
working on Bleacher Report. Just to his side

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.599
is Ethan Sherwood Strauss, or

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.050
[Strauss responds off the microphone]

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.500
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yes. [chuckles] Yes. He,
currently he works on the ESPN TrueHoop blog

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.430
as well as WarriorsWorld.net and you've also
done some work for Salon in the past. And

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.960
then on the end there we have Tim Kawakami,
who writes for the San Jose Mercury-News.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.360
And this is gonna be, I guess, a bit of a
panel discussion here, but we'll hear from

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.120
each of our speakers for about ten or fifteen
minutes and then we'll have some time at the

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.149
end for some questions. So, Ethan, if you
wanna come up to the microphone, please. Thanks.

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:15.729
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: Hi everybody. And
thanks to Tim and King for coming out here.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.869
It's just fantastic just to spend some time
in this space with two of my favorite sports

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.869
writers.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.430
And thanks so much to Justin for inviting
us out. Well, I think the idea is we're talking

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:34.450
about sports journalism today from a multitude
of perspectives,three. And my particular perspective

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.719
is more of a small-time, scrapping, trying
to knock at the door of the business, and

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.130
trying to really make it in sports journalism.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.939
And I love it. I really do. It's fantastic.
I've been a fan of it for years. I've been

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:55.149
a fan of sports for years, obviously, and
a fan of sports writers. And it's been great

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:59.951
so far, despite the frustrations it has. And
what are the frustrations?

00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:01.570
[Ethan Sherwood Strauss laughs]

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.810
Which is my segue [chuckles] to basically
some of the things that are interesting to

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:15.330
me so far, now that I've been writing in public
and on ESPN. Well, the irony of sports writing

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.540
to me is that you talk about this thing that
everybody loves, or at least, a lot of people

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.540
love.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.080
People love sports, but so much of the feedback
you get is negative. It's very emotional.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.670
It's very angry. And I think that some of
that has to do with just creating things in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:39.500
a public space and the nature of the internet
and the way people feel comfortable anonymously

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.500
sniping.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.280
I think, to paraphrase Tina Fey, I think she
once said that if you're ever feeling too

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.250
good about yourself, there's this thing called
the internet. And,

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.660
[laughter]

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:56.220
I think that rings true. But I do believe
that with sports, fans tend to react more

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:03.460
vituperatively and on a more emotional level.
And I think it's a unique beast. And why is

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:04.460
it a unique beast?

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:11.750
Why is this so? I think because sports often
are this environment where people are living

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.710
vicariously through the participants. When
fans watch their favorite players on TV, they're

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:25.840
really, they've bought stock in their favorite
player getting assessed and him winning and

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.460
our collective praise of that player.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:32.290
So when you slight that player, or that team,
or it's a perceived slight, then they take

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:41.590
it personally. It's like you insulted them.
And it's very interesting to me. Take a Derek

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.360
Rose fan. He's a really popular player on
the Chicago Bulls. He's gonna win MVP. I've

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.180
gotten angry emails from fans about this particular
player and I think it's because they feel

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.880
sort of one with Derek Rose, even though he's
a total stranger.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:04.891
And this, the angry emails were my masculinity
gets put into question. It's usually in a

00:04:04.891 --> 00:04:11.970
way that's either homophobic or sexist and
I think it's different from actually the writing

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.000
at Salon.com, where King once hired me as
an intern. I think many of the comments there

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.850
more pertains to intellectual vanity.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.240
The commenter wants to prove he's smarter
than you on a political issue, in the political

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.510
arena. But this, in this way, may of the fans
of sports, they wanna prove that they're tougher

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.190
than you are. Or that you're a little girl
[chuckles].

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.600
So, I find that curious. I also think that,
much like the Salon commenter, in the sports

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.810
arena, I'm deriving my masculinity and my
identity from proving that I'm smarter than

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.590
this commenter, or smarter than the conventional
wisdom. So basically, the upshot is that we're

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:54.060
all crazy, I think, [laughs] is my eloquent
way of putting it.

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.720
So, how did I get into this? Well, much like
the angry commenter, it was out of frustration.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.510
A while back, I had come back from New York
with my tail between my legs, having worked

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:12.530
NBA PR. I couldn't find a job and I had a
lot of free time. So, I just wanted a respite.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:18.810
I wanted something enjoyable to do. And so
I sought out the Golden State Warriors. And

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:24.270
as anyone who follows the Golden State Warriors,
might be able [chuckles] to jump ahead of

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.000
me in the conclusion. It was not relaxing.
Indeed, it was actually just more frustrating.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
[laughs]

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.889
And born from that frustration, I started
writing about them online and trying to convert

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.620
some of that negativity, some of that free
time in my own life plus frustration with

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.760
the team into something positive and creative.
And it's worked well. It's gotten the ball

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.540
rolling.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.770
It's gotten me doing stuff that I think is
creative and fun, despite the carping I'm

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:00.730
doing about commenters. And it's really put
me on the path to making my avocation my vocation,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:08.240
which is great. And since, obviously I think
you can deduce that I hate proper segues,

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:13.330
[chuckles] what is the state of basketball
writing today from my perspective?

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:20.169
I think to a consumer it's fantastic. And
I mean, I mainly consider myself a consumer.

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:25.750
With the internet and with the blogs and there
are so many perspectives and so many talented

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:31.340
people trying to parse this sport in so many
different ways. We have more information in

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:32.340
general.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:36.400
We have Synergy Sports, which can just give
you any basketball play that you could ever

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.520
desire from any player and categorize that.
And you just learn more and more. Not only

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.040
that, but we have more advanced statistics
to inform you as to what the hell's happening

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040
in the game.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:53.390
And well, as Rob Mahoney of the New York Times'
"Off the Dribble" Blog elucidated we're sort

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.040
of screwed in that respect because we're never
ever going to completely figure basketball

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.380
out despite our advanced statistics in it.
It's just exciting to try. And you just have

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.199
more information and the journey is more fun
than it ever has been before.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:15.979
So, for a consumer, it's great. For a writer,
eh. I mean, it has its upsides and downsides.

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:21.760
Economically, it's certainly tough out there.
It's tough to get paid. Monetizing content

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:29.760
is a broader issue and one that, this is just
one small facet underneath that umbrella of

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.351
the problem of monetizing content.

00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:36.430
So, just know that many of the basketball
writers and sports writers out there are doing

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:44.700
it out of love, probably against their wiser
inclinations. And emotionally, many writers

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:50.060
have dismissed the effect and impact of the
negative feedback that I mentioned earlier.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:56.669
But I just think that it has to have some
sort of effect, positive or negative. Positive,

00:07:56.669 --> 00:08:01.750
all the negative feedback that you might get
from writing about sports perhaps it would

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:06.169
make you stronger and tougher and more inclined
to search within for what you think is honest

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:09.360
and true and correct and just develop a thick
skin.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.430
But you could go the other way. I mean, perhaps
that you would just become more inclined to

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:21.850
say something conventional and not get drowned
in torrents of internet flame and internet

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.640
rage. And so, I think it could go one of two
ways, but it certainly has an impact and that's

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.670
really interesting to me.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:32.490
It's a new medium. Essentially, the internet
has returned us to Elizabethan England where

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:38.099
you perform on stage and you get rotted fruit
and vegetables thrown at you immediately.

00:08:38.099 --> 00:08:44.690
So, I just think it's an interesting by-product
of the times and I think that it does have

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:46.720
an impact on the profession.

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:51.670
On the balance, the creative community is
great in basketball. I'm assuming it is for

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:58.841
baseball. I'm not a big follower of baseball.
I know that King and Tim are. And I also want

00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:03.140
to mention that Tim does a lot of great basketball
work. I forgot, too. It's part of why the

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.430
creative community is so great.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:09.680
Not only do you have young bloggers within
the ESPN TrueHoop network, but you have guys

00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:16.270
in print who are adopting some of the fantastic
aspects of social media and Tim has a fantastic

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:22.750
blog that has a great command of tone and
has a lot of reporting and breaking news combined

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:26.260
with the great voice and tone and opinion.

00:09:26.260 --> 00:09:31.790
So, there's so much out there for the consumer.
The community is great. I think a lot of the

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.810
bloggers, even though writers are by their
nature narcissistic and insecure and all that

00:09:37.810 --> 00:09:45.100
stuff, they work well together and we work
against our worser baser instincts and we,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.760
it's pretty much good times. So, I'm just
gonna quickly go through my frustrations because

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.390
that's what started me on this path in the
first place. What could be better about basketball

00:09:54.390 --> 00:10:00.480
writing? I think that, I don't think that
we police ourselves well.

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:07.750
I don't think that we really question writers
who use anonymous sources too often, or who

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:13.660
use anonymous sources for the wrong reasons
so as to insult a guy in a snarky way with

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:19.750
no name attached. I think that's unethical
and immoral, but yet, I don't see other writers

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:21.670
really calling out that kind of behavior.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.550
So I think that's one of the reasons why it
persists. And I think I'm part of the problem

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:29.600
in that respect. I'm hypocritical for even
bringing it up because I think a lot of people

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.000
are in my position of economic insecurity
and not wanting to burn bridges and that's

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.140
why we don't go, "Hey, that's not the way
to report this. That's not the way you should

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.140
do it."

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:47.060
So, that's a frustration. I also would say
that my second frustration pertains to race

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:53.610
in sports. Sports are just fraught with racial
issues. I mean basketball. It's a majority

00:10:53.610 --> 00:11:01.910
black sport with a majority white fan base
and majority white coaches and owners and

00:11:01.910 --> 00:11:02.910
all that stuff.

00:11:02.910 --> 00:11:07.240
So, obviously there are racial tensions and
racial issues, but white sports writers, my

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:12.800
ethnic ilk, they just don't want to talk about
that for the most part. And there are just

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:17.720
two ways it goes. It's either they say race
is not an issue on a particular issue because

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:22.529
they're angry at an athlete, like Barry Bonds
or LeBron James, and race can't be an issue

00:11:22.529 --> 00:11:25.270
because otherwise their opinion might,

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:30.120
they might be in a sticky situation. So, the
one way white sports writers go about it is

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.360
to say for the most part, and I'm generalizing
here, there are some who make good comments

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:39.490
and observations. But the way they go about
it is to just dismiss the issue entirely.

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:44.870
Or, if they think that race is an issue, then
they just don't wanna talk about it and believe

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:49.560
that there are great black journalists and
reporters who do talk about these issues.

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.240
But I think that conversation is worse or
the majority of sports writers, and that would

00:11:55.240 --> 00:12:01.980
be white sports writers, to just ignore all
of the sociology of sports and a lot of these

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:03.769
tensions.

00:12:03.769 --> 00:12:09.200
I don't think that makes the conversation
better. So, those are my frustrations and

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.910
I'm ending when I'm talking about that being
as starting my whole journey in this process

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:18.810
in the first place. So I might as well. And
thank you so much for having me and we're

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:23.270
gonna be doing questions at the end. And King,
are you up right now? Is it,

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:26.230
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: responds off microphone

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.560
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: Oh Tim's gonna go?
OK. Cool.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:36.170
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: Thank you. I'm Tim Kawakami
with San Jose Mercury-News. I think I'm representing

00:12:36.170 --> 00:12:41.230
old journalism in this and knowing that probably
about two more years left of old journalism.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:45.430
So, if there are any job openings, please
let me know. And in fact, that is what I tell

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:49.950
people. I have high school kids or college
kids asking me, "How do I get a job?" And

00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:55.850
I tell them, in sports writing in particular,
you cannot follow my path. You can't go to

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.279
journalism school, which I did at Northwestern.

00:12:57.279 --> 00:13:01.459
You can't get internships, like I did. You
can't work your way up through newspapers.

00:13:01.459 --> 00:13:04.339
I started in Philadelphia and worked my way
back here. 'Cause those jobs aren't available.

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:08.269
None of those jobs are available. I say, "Go
get a job at Google and figure out how to

00:13:08.269 --> 00:13:10.170
get started writing there."

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:15.670
I don't know that they do that at Google,
but I don't understand how you would do it

00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:19.580
and that's what we're all figuring out. I
won't go through the whole spiel because I'm

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:25.250
certainly, any questions are probably gonna
be better than anything I say. But I do find

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:26.250
myself,

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:29.430
I'm watching Deadwood right now. I don't know
if you guys watch that, the HBO show, which

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:35.660
I'm loving right now in DVD. It's an unincorporated
land where they’re mining for gold in the

00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:42.269
1870s. Part of no country. Part of no state.
They're all just trying to fend for themselves.

00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:45.930
And I do find myself thinking like I'm in
Deadwood right now. I'm not sure if I'm the

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:52.790
bad-assed whorehouse runner or I'm the broke
bartender or perhaps I'm one of the whores.

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:59.980
I don't know. We're all figuring out. We all
have jobs, the ones of us who do. I got a

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.959
pretty good one and I don't wanna lose it.

00:14:01.959 --> 00:14:08.959
But I don't know that,we're looking for Montana
to annex us, or South Dakota to annex us,

00:14:08.959 --> 00:14:15.260
or the Navajo Nation to annex us. 'Cause we're
going away. We're not attached to anything

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:20.829
that's gonna last very much longer. We don't
like to admit it, but it's true.

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:26.430
What we do, the journalism that we do, is
important and I think people will continue

00:14:26.430 --> 00:14:32.490
to want to read, whether it's sports or world
news or politics, obviously. There are more

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.269
people reading us and more people wanting
to read us than ever before. They're just

00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:36.430
not paying for it.

00:14:36.430 --> 00:14:41.180
And we're hoping the iPad application works
out for us. I don't know that that's gonna

00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:47.290
be the savior. We're hoping for a whole lot
of things. We don’t know. And we're trying

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:52.550
to find out how we're gonna get attached and
it's not specific to the newspaper. Each person

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:54.019
in the newspaper is trying to figure out how
we're gonna attach.

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:59.990
And that's where I come in for here, is I'm
just grabbing at anything. I would say up

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:06.430
to the year 2007, newspaper journalism was
pretty much the same for the last 50 years.

00:15:06.430 --> 00:15:13.480
And then from 2007 to now, it has changed
more than it has ever changed from 1940 to

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.800
2007.

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:20.519
There's blogging. Now, there's Twitter, tweeting,
which I'm doing all these things. The appropriate

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:26.410
thing for me to say is, conveniently for me,
I might have been a decent columnist in my

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:31.870
day, I don't know. I'm a much better blogger
than I was a columnist. I'm a much better

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:33.370
tweeter than I was a blogger.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:38.779
And whatever comes next, I might be better
at that, too. I just shapes, it fits my thinking.

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:43.960
I like fast things. I like quick comments.
I like being embedded in the situation. Go

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.540
to the Chinese game yesterday and ask about
Brandon Bell, the big prospect, if he's gonna

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:48.540
make the team.

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:52.769
I like getting that out quick. I like spinning
it quick. I like knowing the back story and

00:15:52.769 --> 00:15:59.130
putting that out fast, not wandering in the
forest, jumping into something and grabbing

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:04.079
onto it, whether it's the Warriors, whether
it's the 49ers.

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:09.010
When they're hiring their coach, Jim Harbaugh,
and he had five other offers, I was tweeting

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:15.550
that and it got 2500 new Twitter followers
in two days, because I was on top of it, generally

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:19.769
was not wrong on it. Generally, people were
wanting to know about that.

00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:24.570
And whatever is next up after Twitter, I'm
gonna be on that, too. Whether that keeps

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:32.450
me going through my employment history, I
don't know. But that's why we're all kinda,

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.760
I don't know. And I don't know when 19-year
olds ask me what are they gonna do, I tell

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.200
them, "You tell me what we're gonna do, 'cause
you're the one who's gonna decide it. ’Cause

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.230
I don't know what the jobs are gonna be."

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.240
I'm one of the youngest sports writers, main
sports writers, in Bay Area newspaper sports

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.019
writing. That's pretty bad. 'Cause I ain't
young. We're not building up that next generation.

00:16:53.019 --> 00:16:58.860
The next generation of sports writers is Ethan,
or is, maybe not him, though.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:03.361
I'd be disappointed if it was. It's a lot
different. Well, Bleacher Report, which is

00:17:03.361 --> 00:17:07.980
one of my arch enemies, by the way, and I
don't think King is specifically representative

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:13.741
of that, or maybe he is. But that's part of
the fun for it for me, too. Bleacher Report

00:17:13.741 --> 00:17:16.860
has attacked me and I've attacked them and
we've gone back and forth.

00:17:16.860 --> 00:17:22.250
And again, I don't know if it's been King
or not, but it's OK. I don't mind it 'cause

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.740
if I can't stand it, then I shouldn't do it.
And if they can't stand it, they shouldn't

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:31.179
do it either. And we're both still standing.
And that's OK. There's certain things that

00:17:31.179 --> 00:17:34.110
have gone on that I don't like between various
other things.

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:38.900
There's certain things that I've done that
other people haven't liked. Other old journalism

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:45.210
people haven't liked that. I don't mind it.
I think that's part of it. I don't mind Al

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:51.390
Davis yelling at me and people like to laugh
about that. A back and forth and accountability

00:17:51.390 --> 00:17:56.370
that isn't just for the sports people, which
I do believe they must be accountable.

00:17:56.370 --> 00:18:00.730
But for me, too. I don't mind it. I don't
mind people. You know, I turned on the radio

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:06.020
once just going home from watching the Warriors
game on TV at my dad's house, turned on KNBR

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:11.549
and I heard my name on the post-game show
about 17 times. What is going on here?

00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:15.299
It's because I had a controversial position
about David Lee, one of their players. The

00:18:15.299 --> 00:18:18.830
talk show host was talking about my opinion,
how wrong it was and callers were calling

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:24.490
up saying how wrong I was. I said, "Is this
a show about me or about the Warriors?" I

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:27.270
don't mind that.

00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.020
It perhaps means I've been accused of being
too much involved. I involve myself too much,

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:38.110
but I also think that's part of the new journalism,
if I'm gonna be part of it. It's partially

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:43.450
participatory, not "I am the story," or "Ethan
is the story," or "King is the story," but

00:18:43.450 --> 00:18:47.730
how that story bounces off of us and how that
is reflected by us.

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:52.669
And if it stinks, if what I'm doing is wrong,
what I love about it is you don't have to

00:18:52.669 --> 00:18:56.280
read it. In fact, you probably won't read
it. You don't have to buy a newspaper. In

00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:01.140
fact, I guarantee most of you do not buy the
San Jose Mercury News. If you read it, you

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:02.490
read it for free.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:06.600
It's a push of the button. It's a click. If
it's not being delivered to you by what I'm

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.190
doing, then you're gonna go click to somebody
else. And if it's TrueHoop, if it's Bush Report,

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:17.630
if it's Google News, I don't know. It won't
necessarily be judged by what your father

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:22.210
bought and what his father bought and what
is delivered on your doorstep.

00:19:22.210 --> 00:19:28.300
And I like that. I don't mind competing in
that marketplace. If it's gonna be Deadwood,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:33.500
then I'm gonna have a couple guns on me and
I'm gonna play some poker. And if I survive,

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.840
I survive. And if I don't, I don't. And I'm
kinda combative like that if you might have

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:38.919
been able to tell.

00:19:38.919 --> 00:19:44.400
But I'm certainly, any other questions beyond
the Deadwood analogy, I'd be happy to talk

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:53.880
about, but I'm gonna pass it on to King here.

00:19:53.880 --> 00:20:00.720
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Hi. I'm King Kaufman. My background
is similar to Tim. I went to journalism school

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:06.600
and started in newspapers. I worked in the
old Hearst San Francisco Examiner, which is

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.293
not the same paper that you see today as the
San Francisco Examiner.

00:20:09.293 --> 00:20:16.770
It was the afternoon paper. And Tim said something
interesting a minute ago. He said that newspapers

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:23.490
hadn't changed for about 50 years until 2007.
And I left the Examiner. I left newspapers

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:29.140
at the beginning of 1996. And the reason I
left is 'cause someone offered me a job.

00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:37.950
But the reason I leaped was because the world
was clearly changing around us. And the newspaper

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:46.160
I worked for, the entire newspaper industry
was not changing with it. And it said. It

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:52.740
was a huge industrial failure for newspapers
to not react until whenever they did,2007

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:54.720
or 2003 or whenever it was.

00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:56.049
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: 2003.

00:20:56.049 --> 00:20:59.640
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Yeah, the mic. You have to
turn the mic on at the bottom. But he said

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:00.780
he couldn't agree with me more.
[audience laughs]

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:01.780
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: [shouting] I couldn't agree
with him more.

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:08.260
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Yeah. He agrees with me. And
newspapers just completely failed to react

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:14.220
to the internet except to react with fear
and loathing. We ran endless stories in the

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:18.360
Examiner about how the internet was nothing
but a bunch of pedophiles and to lock it up

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.860
from your kids.

00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:26.650
And we did nothing about this. I mean, our
audience was voting with their feet as quickly

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:30.430
as they could, as quickly as the technology
came online, that this is how we want our

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:35.250
information. And, at least while I was still
there, we were doing nothing about it.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:41.102
I went, eventually, after one or two other
jobs, I went to Salon.com, where I worked

00:21:41.102 --> 00:21:48.350
for 14 years until this past January. And
I did a lot of things there. Most of what,

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:55.630
if anybody knows my name, because I wrote
a sports column there for seven years. And

00:21:55.630 --> 00:22:01.850
I recently, two months ago, took a job at
Bleacher Report, which Tim mentioned.

00:22:01.850 --> 00:22:05.789
[microphone feedback]
So, sorry. And the person who runs the Bleacher

00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:11.530
Report Twitter feed, which is not me, likes
to go back and forth with Tim. I think that's

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:12.530
what he's referring to.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.490
[Tim Kawakami responds off the microphone]

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:22.290
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: OK. Bleacher Report has been
an education for me after more than 20 years

00:22:22.290 --> 00:22:30.059
in this business. And I wanna tell you a little
bit about why that's been. The epiphany that

00:22:30.059 --> 00:22:35.520
Bleacher Report has taught me, and working
there has been like learning a foreign language.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:43.420
And what really dawned on me is that journalism
is practiced as an art form. I don't think

00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.730
the people, I don't think those of us who
do it would use those words. We wouldn't say

00:22:46.730 --> 00:22:51.750
we're artists, but basically the decisions
made are mostly aesthetic. We think this is

00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:57.299
what we should cover because it's our judgment
that we should cover these things.

00:22:57.299 --> 00:23:01.240
The marketplace plays a part. You cover the
Giants and not the local Pony League because

00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:05.520
more people are gonna read about the Giants.
But there's certain things. You cover the

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:09.620
water board because you have to, because that's
your judgment that it's important.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:15.190
What makes a good story beyond the basics
of "it can't be plagiarized" and that sort

00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:19.929
of thing, what makes a good story is an aesthetic
choice. We know it when we see it. We judge

00:23:19.929 --> 00:23:25.870
what is a good story. It makes us feel a certain
way.

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.410
And then you make some concessions to the
marketplace, like "well we have to cover the

00:23:30.410 --> 00:23:34.121
Giants," or it may not be the most important
thing in the world that there's a Megan Fox

00:23:34.121 --> 00:23:37.471
movie coming out, but we're gonna run three
feature stories this week about Megan Fox.

00:23:37.471 --> 00:23:44.840
That's a marketplace decision. Bleacher Report
is the opposite of that. To Bleacher Report,

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.150
what is a good story is the one that gets
the most hits. And at least in the early part

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.820
of the company, the early history of the company,
which has only been live for about three years

00:23:53.820 --> 00:24:00.390
I think, the quality of it has been secondary.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:07.300
Essentially, it's a product company. It's
not an art company. The product is content

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.740
for sports fans. And it acts the same way
it would act if it were making a car or a

00:24:12.740 --> 00:24:21.280
piece of software:figure out what the demand
is and try to supply the demand the customers.

00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:26.110
And here's what has been really fascinating
to me, learning about this, is that a couple

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:31.309
of months ago I would've said, "This is a
recipe for disaster." If you approach content

00:24:31.309 --> 00:24:37.590
that way, you'll do nothing but lowest common
denominator crap and it'll be horrible.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:41.901
And a lot of what Bleacher Report has done
has been lowest common denominator crap and

00:24:41.901 --> 00:24:47.030
it's been horrible. But what Bleacher Report
has learned, and what I've learned, is one

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:50.600
of the things the market demands is quality.

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:56.350
And Bleacher Report has in the last six months,
I'm not exactly sure how long 'cause I've

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.940
only been there for two months, but it's why
I was hired, is in this effort to raise the

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:05.030
quality of the writing at Bleacher Report.
Why are we doing that? 'Cause the market's

00:25:05.030 --> 00:25:06.030
demanding it.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.450
The Bleacher Report reached a point where
it couldn't make that next level of deal,

00:25:09.450 --> 00:25:13.820
whatever company was saying, "We're not gonna
put our logo next to your logo 'cause you

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:21.539
guys are publishing crap." And so, OK, that's
the market speaking. And the readers complaining

00:25:21.539 --> 00:25:24.980
on Twitter, complaining everywhere, complaining
in our comments.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:31.640
"This is a crap article." "Bleacher Report
is terrible." It was not a decision made by

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:37.380
the CEO who got tired of his friend's saying
at parties, "Boy, Bleacher Report's content

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:43.670
is terrible." It was strictly a market-based
decision to increase the quality. And I was

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:46.571
hired as part of that effort to educate our
writers.

00:25:46.571 --> 00:25:53.809
We have a huge roster of unpaid writers. You
have to apply to write, but anybody can apply.

00:25:53.809 --> 00:25:59.769
And if you're good enough, you start writing
about your favorite teams in sports. And the,

00:25:59.769 --> 00:26:00.769
.

00:26:00.769 --> 00:26:04.980
what we are hoping is that you will take advantage
of our editing resources and our educational

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:09.651
resources and our feedback, and you improve
as a writer and there's various steps that

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:14.720
you can go through to get to the top of the
writing pyramid. And at the very top there

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.750
are some paid positions, but most of the people
writing for us are writing for free.

00:26:18.750 --> 00:26:24.400
And this is what Tim and Ethan were talking
about and I'd be happy to talk about it, too.

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:28.950
It's hard out here for a sports writer because
there's an awful lot of content and there's

00:26:28.950 --> 00:26:32.080
a lot of people who are willing to create
that content without getting paid for it,

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.299
or without getting paid very much.

00:26:33.299 --> 00:26:37.892
So, it's awfully hard to justify the idea
you're gonna pay somebody to do it when you

00:26:37.892 --> 00:26:41.080
can get people to do it for free. It's not
impossible to justify that and there's good

00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:44.740
reasons to pay people and there's good reasons
to pay some people a lot of money. But it's

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:49.650
made it a much tougher market for simple,
lemonade stand reasons.

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:55.330
But that's been the fascinating thing for
me is learning about how the market can demand

00:26:55.330 --> 00:27:04.970
quality and the market asked us to raise the
quality of what we're doing. And we are in

00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:10.780
the process of trying to do that. And so,
that's where our little corner of sports writing

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.080
today is, is we are a voice for fans.

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:19.520
We let fans write about their favorite teams
and sports if they're good enough. And some

00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.970
of them are just fans. Some of them are Google
workers by day, sports writers by nights.

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:28.250
Some of them are people like Ethan, or a lot
of them are a lot younger than Ethan, high

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.831
school and college students, and they're just
aspiring sports writers and this is a way

00:27:31.831 --> 00:27:36.830
for them to get some training and get some
feedback and get their work in front of a

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:38.350
pretty large audience.

00:27:38.350 --> 00:27:44.160
And it's just been fascinating to me. So,
that's my spiel on Bleacher Report on the

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:51.039
state of journalism today. I don't know where
we wanna go from here. If anybody has any

00:27:51.039 --> 00:27:54.490
questions for us, I guess. Do we have any
questions from the web?

00:27:54.490 --> 00:28:02.570
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: So, we have one question
internally. Somebody said, "My son is a freshman

00:28:02.570 --> 00:28:07.300
in college and is pursuing a sports management
journalism major. What recommendations do

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:09.900
you have for him as he looks to get into this
competitive field?"

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:12.700
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: What's he studying?

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:17.169
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: It was sports management
slash journalism.

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:25.980
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: I said it before, I tell people,
"Go work for Google." I don't know where those

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:30.840
jobs are coming from. That's, they're not
coming from a newspaper and that's been the

00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:35.330
training ground for years and years. Whether
you start in newspapers,

00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:43.600
a lot of the Yahoo or the formerly AOL FanHouse
or ESPN.com writers came from newspapers.

00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.789
The best ones did, that's for sure. That's
not happening now and now writers are coming

00:28:48.789 --> 00:28:55.140
up from other places that are not newspapers.
So, the normal pathway is not there anymore.

00:28:55.140 --> 00:29:00.630
It's very hard to say what it is, other than
I think Ethan is an example I've used and

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:06.460
I can use some other people, is you just go
find a place to write if you're gonna write

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:13.070
and someone discovers you. And Bleacher Report
is gonna be one of those places. And whether

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:18.250
that morphs into something bigger as a reporter
or morphs into something at another website,

00:29:18.250 --> 00:29:19.840
probably not a newspaper.

00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:24.200
I think that's how that's happening and I
see it, how many different NBA bloggers are

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:30.919
out there now that just created something
SI.com, ThePointForward, various other sites

00:29:30.919 --> 00:29:34.890
have just kinda morphed out of nothing and
I don't know how much money they're making,

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:36.450
but they're making some.

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:42.120
And they're creating careers out of this.
And it's not the path that I know, unfortunately.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:49.210
But I think good writing is sought after.
People wanna read it. Good analysis. The only

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:53.220
word I have is a lot that is happening for
people who aren't out there covering teams

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.289
every day and asking questions.

00:29:54.289 --> 00:29:59.110
Ethan's out there. But a lot of people I read
aren't. And I worry about that because, we

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:03.661
were just talking about this at lunch, the
one thing that I think is very important that

00:30:03.661 --> 00:30:09.960
might be getting lost is if I write something
that is tough on somebody, I know I'm gonna

00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.750
get yelled at very soon afterwards by that
person.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.830
And it has happened a lot. And it affects
what I write, but it does not affect how I

00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:22.250
write, or even vice versa. I'm not even sure
if I said that correctly. I don't want the

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:27.000
next generation of writers, or the next many
generations of writers not having that background

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.240
where if I write something bad about Al Davis,
I'm gonna hear about it from the Raiders the

00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.240
next day.

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:37.240
That's OK. Because it's important that I write
what I write and knowing that they're gonna

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.040
react in a certain way.

00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:44.669
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Yeah. I just wanna say I agree
with Tim that if you wanna be a writer, you

00:30:44.669 --> 00:30:48.860
write, that you find a way to write. You find
a place to write. And the great thing today

00:30:48.860 --> 00:30:54.370
is when we were starting out, if you wanted
to write and have somebody read it, you had

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:56.480
to convince somebody to let them work for
you.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:00.870
And there are only so many of those spots
available. And now, everybody's a newspaper.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:05.600
Everybody's a publisher and you start writing
your own blog, or you start writing for some

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:11.520
place like Bleacher Report or ESPY Nation
or any one of a number of places that are

00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:13.780
hosting writers and you get your work out
there.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.500
And if you're good and if you're passionate
about it, you'll be doing it a lot and you'll

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:23.760
start to build an audience. And you have to
go out and work it. You have to make those

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.090
connections. You have to try to get access
so that you can do, it's not just writing,

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:29.419
as Tim points out.

00:31:29.419 --> 00:31:34.711
There's also the reporting edge of it and
that's harder to get into because there can't

00:31:34.711 --> 00:31:41.059
be that open market for access because you
just can't fit. The world can fit 50000 NBA

00:31:41.059 --> 00:31:45.950
bloggers, but you can’t put 50000 people
in the Celtics locker room. So, that's a harder

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:46.950
part of it.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:51.220
But you start writing and that's the way to
get somewhere. Find a place where you can

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:56.429
get people reading you. And you can create
that place on Blogspot.com or any other place.

00:31:56.429 --> 00:32:02.190
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: I think Tim and King covered
that question quite well. Is there a question

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.190
in the back?

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:06.980
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: I'm not sure this
is even relevant to today, but we don't have

00:32:06.980 --> 00:32:11.000
a whole lot of other people waiting, so I'll
try this. [chuckles] I went to Sundance and

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.300
saw 13 movies and my favorite was Big Fan.
Did any of you guys see that?

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.300
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: Yes, yes I did.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:18.520
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: So, it's about
the relationship of the fan to his favorite

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.270
player. The guy actually gets beaten up by
his favorite player. [chuckles]

00:32:21.270 --> 00:32:23.940
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: Quantrell Bishop,
I believe.

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:29.690
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #1: Yeah. So through
a lot of this event, I just wanted to bring

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:32.090
that up and see what you thought of that movie.

00:32:32.090 --> 00:32:35.480
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: I thought it was
a very good movie and it made me feel actually

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:39.590
a little sad and pathetic as a sports fan
and a sports writer. And how you know it's

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:42.840
good. If a movie makes you feel a little,
if it makes you feel anything, [chuckles]

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:46.029
especially shame, then it's probably doing
something right.

00:32:46.029 --> 00:32:54.120
And I think I sort of touched on that when
I spoke earlier about how it is a little ridiculous

00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:02.340
to watch sports and to be a fan these complete
strangers. And I think, at least for men,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.950
and I'm speaking from that perspective, a
lot of times it's as though we're trying to

00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:09.870
siphon masculinity from these warriors. [chuckles]

00:33:09.870 --> 00:33:16.610
And we're trying to feel more manly vicariously
through them. And I think that was something

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:21.620
that movie lampooned. And it's certainly something
I do on a certain level and it's certainly

00:33:21.620 --> 00:33:27.149
something that's a little bit ridiculous.
So, that would be my response to your question.

00:33:27.149 --> 00:33:29.630
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Any other? OK.

00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:35.840
MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #2: Just wanted to follow
up on one point that you guys both made, Tim

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:42.080
and King, on access. And the question I really
have is do you think that quality has been

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.600
forever compromised with a decline in access.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:49.340
I know when I was, maybe ten years ago, I
don't even like baseball, but I used to love

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:52.650
reading Peter Gammons 'cause I knew that he
talked to everybody. He knew exactly what

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:56.450
was going on. He had the inside scoop. And
if he said the Giants were gonna be good,

00:33:56.450 --> 00:33:57.450
then the Giants were gonna be good.

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:02.480
No offense to Ethan, but if somebody else
said the Giants were gonna be good but he

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:08.889
didn't have that sort of inside knowledge,
I'm gonna have less interest in reading. Given

00:34:08.889 --> 00:34:11.669
like all the other channels now that teams
have,

00:34:11.669 --> 00:34:17.859
the players have their own Twitter feeds and
blogs and teams, I think, are much more savvy

00:34:17.859 --> 00:34:23.109
about the way they put the information out,
letting in behind the scenes, do you think

00:34:23.109 --> 00:34:30.749
that we'll ever have that again where you
have that truly unique access and voice that

00:34:30.749 --> 00:34:36.109
professional writers used to have, given their
relationship with the teams they cover?

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:41.619
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: I think you have more access
today than you had 15 years ago reading Peter

00:34:41.619 --> 00:34:46.129
Gammons. And I don't think you even realize
how much you know today that you wouldn't

00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:48.839
have known 15 years ago.

00:34:48.839 --> 00:34:54.769
Like you say, the teams put out more information.
The players have, I mean, any source, any

00:34:54.769 --> 00:35:01.819
story has access to you directly. You hear
and see more than ever would have been heard

00:35:01.819 --> 00:35:07.079
or seen when everything that you had to know
had to come through Peter Gammons and however

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:11.430
many other beat-writers your local team had.

00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:16.349
There will always be some access. There's
always gonna be somebody who's got that access,

00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:21.940
whether it's the Peter Gammons' type, or they'll
start letting the top bloggers in. They're

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:27.509
never gonna close the clubhouse. I don't think
that, even if Tim is right and newspapers

00:35:27.509 --> 00:35:30.670
are going away, some thing or somebody will
take their place.

00:35:30.670 --> 00:35:35.460
So, I think the access is getting better all
the time. Although, countervailing that is

00:35:35.460 --> 00:35:40.160
that like you say, teams are getting savvier
all the time. And they are smarter about what

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:45.231
they, how they train people and what they
are willing to say. And they know they are

00:35:45.231 --> 00:35:47.900
being watched 24/7, but they are being watched
24/7.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:53.329
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: I just wanted to make a point
that I love, 'cause I do talk about this,

00:35:53.329 --> 00:36:00.529
it does, credibility isn't something you can
just go out and grab. And Gammons, probably

00:36:00.529 --> 00:36:04.959
more so five, ten years ago than now, but
people like Gammons have earned it because

00:36:04.959 --> 00:36:06.620
not they're the one that you see.

00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:12.911
They're the one you trust. And my old retort
was "it's gonna come out in the wash." There's

00:36:12.911 --> 00:36:17.579
a thousand people maybe writing now. The five
best ones are the ones who are gonna last

00:36:17.579 --> 00:36:21.400
because they're the ones people want to read
and they care about reading.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:27.039
And whether their newspaper goes down, or
ESPN doesn't hire them, but however, if they're

00:36:27.039 --> 00:36:31.859
good, they're good and people are going to
trust them and gonna believe in what they

00:36:31.859 --> 00:36:35.390
write and will want to read what they write
the next day. That always is my definition.

00:36:35.390 --> 00:36:42.030
Something big happens, who do I wanna read?
I wanna read this person, period. And what

00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:47.140
you speak to, is that sort of sensibility.
I think it will come out in the wash. I think

00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:53.759
people do vote with their fingers now and
the audience is gonna be there.

00:36:53.759 --> 00:36:58.500
But the strainer is gonna be more immense
now because it's instead of a hundred people

00:36:58.500 --> 00:37:03.890
to choose from, like King said, it's a thousand,
it's 15 thousand, it's the Twitter feed, it's

00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:12.470
MLB.com, it's Fox Network. Katie Rosenthal
writes for Fox: very authoritative. All the

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:15.269
writers for ESPN.com: very authoritative.

00:37:15.269 --> 00:37:20.799
In San Francisco, we may have a few of our
own. I'm not gonna name them because if I

00:37:20.799 --> 00:37:27.099
leak people out, I wouldn't want to do that.
But it's gonna take that sense of "I need

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:31.109
to read somebody accountable and I don't necessarily
need to read the five people the team wants

00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:33.339
me to read."

00:37:33.339 --> 00:37:38.150
The Warriors maybe do this. Maybe other teams
don't do it as much as the Warriors do. But

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:43.789
that is always gonna be worth something. Websites
are paying for people who have this kind of

00:37:43.789 --> 00:37:49.809
ability, nationally more so than locally.
Unfortunately for many of us, the money is

00:37:49.809 --> 00:37:50.809
in the national news.

00:37:50.809 --> 00:37:55.349
But it's still gonna be there because people
still wanna read it. 'Cause you wanna read

00:37:55.349 --> 00:38:00.890
it because many people are like you. It's
taken more time than I would like it to have.

00:38:00.890 --> 00:38:05.509
I wish there was a more marketplace in the
Bay Area. This is a big place. We don't have

00:38:05.509 --> 00:38:12.589
that. ESPN has gone to LA, New York, Chicago,
Dallas, with varying levels of success.

00:38:12.589 --> 00:38:16.099
I still think it's gonna be needed. I just
don't, and again what I don't know and the

00:38:16.099 --> 00:38:19.459
frustrating matter for me is that I don't
know who's gonna pay us for it. Comcast is

00:38:19.459 --> 00:38:25.519
now hiring writers and with some amount of
credibility and some with great credibility.

00:38:25.519 --> 00:38:31.099
I'm still a little leery of that because in
the Giants zone, 40% of them they have contracts

00:38:31.099 --> 00:38:32.289
with all the teams.

00:38:32.289 --> 00:38:40.099
I had my own blow-up with them over the Warriors.
Again, I have marginal faith in something

00:38:40.099 --> 00:38:44.999
like that. It's still possible. And they still
need people to trust what they're writing

00:38:44.999 --> 00:38:50.499
isn't coming strictly from an athlete or a
team. And I do think they are out there and

00:38:50.499 --> 00:38:51.920
they will continue to be out there.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:57.739
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: I think the money-making,
or at least the wealthier sports publications,

00:38:57.739 --> 00:39:03.430
respect and just crave writers with access,
maybe even to a fault in some instances.

00:39:03.430 --> 00:39:08.269
Although, I should take that back. Not to
a fault, but they crave people with access.

00:39:08.269 --> 00:39:14.279
That's why Brian Windhorst, he covered the
Cavs. He knows everything about LeBron James.

00:39:14.279 --> 00:39:19.819
He's been following him since, I believe,
middle school. And he was the Cleveland Plain

00:39:19.819 --> 00:39:20.890
Dealer writer.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:28.549
Well, when ESPN set up a blog to cover the
Miami Heat, they brought Brian Windhorst along.

00:39:28.549 --> 00:39:32.109
Why did they bring him along? I mean, he's
a Cavs writer. Well, they brought him along

00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:36.230
because he has access to everybody in LeBron's
camps.

00:39:36.230 --> 00:39:44.230
So, I think that companies do value that and
I also think from the team side, they'll try

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:50.109
to restrict access and they'll try to sanitize
it for the sake of their PR, but I think they

00:39:50.109 --> 00:39:57.170
know that even bad publicity is publicity.
And if you grant access to writers and you

00:39:57.170 --> 00:40:01.839
just have more people out there talking about
your team, even if it's negative, there's

00:40:01.839 --> 00:40:02.839
a value in that.

00:40:02.839 --> 00:40:09.369
So I think that it will always be around.
And I guess what I also want to say is that

00:40:09.369 --> 00:40:14.240
there are more ways to contribute value than
just having access. You can be a great writer.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.890
You can have an artistic way of conveying
your thoughts.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:23.349
You can be very smart about statistical modeling
and be able to know something about the outcomes

00:40:23.349 --> 00:40:28.099
and how good a team is that perhaps the guy
who's embedded in the clubhouse doesn't. So,

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:33.799
there are various ways to provide value. And
the best way to get noticed is to be good.

00:40:33.799 --> 00:40:35.269
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Any other questions?

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:40.589
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #3: So first of all,
thank you so much for being here and I'm gonna

00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:43.799
ask a question which nobody really knows the
answer to, but I wanted to get your three

00:40:43.799 --> 00:40:44.959
perspectives on it anyways.

00:40:44.959 --> 00:40:50.349
Which is, the million dollar question, up
until 2007 the newspaper industry has been

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:56.319
very similar for the last 50 years and it's
been going through a lot of extreme changes.

00:40:56.319 --> 00:41:02.019
From all three of you, how do you predict
over the next 20 years, 30 years, that journalists

00:41:02.019 --> 00:41:03.880
will be paid?

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:10.390
And what types of new revenue models might
we find if any? Or, will it be closer to there's

00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:17.400
so many people creating content that 80, 90%
of them are doing it for not enough to get

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.880
paid a full living's worth? And then there's
the 10, 20% that have that access, that have

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.979
the job at ESPN.

00:41:25.979 --> 00:41:34.469
Or could it be that, sorry, could it be that
maybe a newspaper like the SF Chronicle isn't

00:41:34.469 --> 00:41:39.960
as much of a way that people make money but
there's personal blogs where the overhead

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:45.779
is a lot lower, but it's enough to cover a
single person's living? Just wanted to get

00:41:45.779 --> 00:41:46.779
everybody's thoughts on that.

00:41:46.779 --> 00:41:50.180
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: OK. I guess I'll
go first. I can tell you how I personally

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:56.259
handle that problem of not knowing where the
next paycheck is coming from, or not knowing

00:41:56.259 --> 00:42:01.089
if it will be sustainable in the future. And
for now, that's just not having kids.

00:42:01.089 --> 00:42:02.089
[laughter]

00:42:02.089 --> 00:42:07.769
Or planning to have kids anytime soon, mixed
with some naiveté and the hopeful belief

00:42:07.769 --> 00:42:13.959
that since I love this and since it's a passion
of mine and perhaps in my grandiosity I feel

00:42:13.959 --> 00:42:19.579
like I have something to offer that eventually
I'll be able to make money on it somehow become

00:42:19.579 --> 00:42:20.579
a star in the field.

00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:30.219
So, I handle it with narcissism, naiveté,
hopefulness. And I don't know what's coming

00:42:30.219 --> 00:42:37.190
around the corner, but I know in the current
state I feel good about what I'm doing. And

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:42.079
I'm just hoping and praying and I'm sure Tim
and King have some good answers.

00:42:42.079 --> 00:42:46.749
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: I can say that I don't think
newspapers are gonna survive. They're not.

00:42:46.749 --> 00:42:52.089
But I more talking in specific a newspaper
that's printed on newsprint and delivered

00:42:52.089 --> 00:42:58.049
to homes and has advertisements for cars and
classified ads for apartments. That's what's

00:42:58.049 --> 00:42:59.049
gone.

00:42:59.049 --> 00:43:04.731
Going to go. It's not gone yet. It's still
paying me, thank God. I think we've seen that

00:43:04.731 --> 00:43:09.690
the titles mean something. We haven't seen
these newspapers fold, or many of them, a

00:43:09.690 --> 00:43:17.049
few of them, despite the prospect of, very
little prospect in the future of making the

00:43:17.049 --> 00:43:19.019
kind of money that these companies want.

00:43:19.019 --> 00:43:24.900
My dearest hope [chuckles] is that the titles
mean enough that when the transition happens,

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:31.049
and I mention the iPad app. There's various
ideas floating around about iTunes like payment,

00:43:31.049 --> 00:43:36.719
micropayment structures. I don't know if I
believe that's actually gonna work or not,

00:43:36.719 --> 00:43:39.390
but at least there's ideas out there that
we should have been thinking about as gains.

00:43:39.390 --> 00:43:45.859
We should have been thinking about it since
1995, but we didn't. The title itself, that

00:43:45.859 --> 00:43:51.200
what, again, without planning it, the reason
why I blog, the reason why I tweet, the reason

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:57.829
why I do those, or I'm on the radio and they
don't pay you when you're a guest on the radio,

00:43:57.829 --> 00:44:03.869
unfortunately, is that if and when there's
a time when they streamline newspaper or whatever

00:44:03.869 --> 00:44:05.779
is next, and I'm just gonna say it's newspapers.

00:44:05.779 --> 00:44:11.219
Say there's a San Jose Mercury-News idea,
maybe not printed up, or maybe it's a weekly,

00:44:11.219 --> 00:44:17.420
or maybe it's something other, or some other
form, the actual reporting and the website

00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:22.809
will have enough behind it where that will
be enough. The San Jose Mercury-News is an

00:44:22.809 --> 00:44:23.809
ideal.

00:44:23.809 --> 00:44:27.380
It still means something to people. If the
San Jose Mercury-News says something--. If

00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:32.109
I put--. I'm not the first. If I blog something
and reporters across the nation quoted the

00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:35.949
San Jose Mercury-News, it really wasn't the
San Jose Mercury-News. It was my blog that

00:44:35.949 --> 00:44:37.349
says San Jose Mercury-News host.

00:44:37.349 --> 00:44:41.749
They don't edit it. And they don't write the
headlines. They don't monitor the reporting.

00:44:41.749 --> 00:44:46.499
They trust me with it. And if I was, again,
would go into the marketplace here, if I was

00:44:46.499 --> 00:44:51.420
bad at it I assume that people wouldn't read
it to the level that they do. The same goes

00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:52.420
with my Twitter feed.

00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:58.199
They don't touch my Twitter feed, it's; I
push a button. It goes up. That idea that

00:44:58.199 --> 00:45:01.869
the Mercury-News, even if people aren't reading
the newspaper, which they aren't very much

00:45:01.869 --> 00:45:08.019
anymore, [audience member sneezes] means something.
It carries me. The next thing, when there's

00:45:08.019 --> 00:45:14.519
an idea that we can monetize this that it
will mean something in whatever it is.

00:45:14.519 --> 00:45:20.180
But it hasn't folded. The LA Daily News loses
money, owned by my company, loses God knows

00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:24.609
how much money every day. San Francisco Chronicle
loses God knows how much money every day.

00:45:24.609 --> 00:45:27.829
We don't. We don't make enough. And they have
not folded.

00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:33.609
There's a reason for this. In my optimistic
world, it's because they still, the title,

00:45:33.609 --> 00:45:38.359
still means something that if the title goes
away, I don't know what replaces it that is

00:45:38.359 --> 00:45:43.720
anything even close to it. So, when we figure
out a way, an economic model, and again, I

00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.269
don't like,

00:45:45.269 --> 00:45:51.229
and those people are very much still the ones
who ignored the changes in the late '90s are

00:45:51.229 --> 00:45:55.950
still very much the same people trying to
figure out what the moves are now. I would

00:45:55.950 --> 00:45:59.709
have much more faith in any cross-section
of people who I saw walking around this campus

00:45:59.709 --> 00:46:01.479
today than the people running.

00:46:01.479 --> 00:46:05.219
And I hope the people running this paper are
not looking at this right now, [chuckles lightly]

00:46:05.219 --> 00:46:14.789
but when there's something, and the marketplace
will find it, I think, I think the titles

00:46:14.789 --> 00:46:18.529
will still be there. I still might not be
there myself, but I think the titles still

00:46:18.529 --> 00:46:22.640
mean something just because the Chronicle
should have closed three years ago if you

00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:27.040
look at the money of it. It hasn't and I don't
think it will.

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:34.059
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Yeah, I agree. I think that
there's tremendous demand. That's not going

00:46:34.059 --> 00:46:40.609
away. We still have the same demand. I mean,
the same societal needs for watchdogs on our

00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:45.349
institutions and we need to know what's going
on in our town with our government and with

00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:48.289
corporations and we wanna know who won the
ball game.

00:46:48.289 --> 00:46:54.469
And even in sports, I think the demand is
ever-growing. And even with, at Bleacher Report

00:46:54.469 --> 00:47:02.019
with this big tent , come write for us. We
have a hard time. We're publishing five, six,

00:47:02.019 --> 00:47:07.779
seven hundred articles a day and we're having
trouble feeding the demand. If we could figure

00:47:07.779 --> 00:47:12.029
out a way to publish a thousand articles a
day, people would read them.

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:21.380
The hard part is finding enough people to
write them. The fact that writers have gotten

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:26.869
paid for writing for newspapers for the last
hundred and whatever years, 200 years, is

00:47:26.869 --> 00:47:31.749
an historical accident. I mean, people really
weren't paying for the writing. Nobody was

00:47:31.749 --> 00:47:37.699
really buying the paper to read about the
water board.

00:47:37.699 --> 00:47:44.219
What we were really selling was a big, giant
hunk of paper that had advertising in it.

00:47:44.219 --> 00:47:53.890
And that's what was subsidizing all this coverage.
And that product, that big hunk of paper,

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:58.019
has gone away. That doesn't exist anymore.
And so, what's left is the part that didn't

00:47:58.019 --> 00:48:01.449
have as much value as that big piece of paper
with all the advertisements in it.

00:48:01.449 --> 00:48:09.299
And so, we need to figure out some other way
to run the business, some other way to subsidize

00:48:09.299 --> 00:48:15.529
all the writing and reporting. And we haven't
found it yet. That's the big project of journalism

00:48:15.529 --> 00:48:18.219
of the next however many years, is figuring
out what that is.

00:48:18.219 --> 00:48:22.609
It's probably not gonna be one magic bullet
thing like, "Oh, here's a substitute for the

00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:28.219
big hunk of paper." There's lots of different
ways that are being tried. There's Spot Us,

00:48:28.219 --> 00:48:36.759
which is voluntary giving, voluntary payment
to, it's a website where you pay to fund certain

00:48:36.759 --> 00:48:37.759
stories.

00:48:37.759 --> 00:48:40.269
You're a freelancer, you put up a story idea.
"I wanna do this story and if I can raise

00:48:40.269 --> 00:48:44.670
this much money, I'll do it." And people donate.
And if you get to that point, then you do

00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:51.130
the story. There's non-profits that take donations.
There's businesses that are doing other things.

00:48:51.130 --> 00:48:57.920
There's MLB.com, which is, that's the company
covering itself and putting it at arm's length

00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:03.749
sometimes and saying, "OK, we don't approve
this story, but our writers have some independence."

00:49:03.749 --> 00:49:08.740
And we all, as intelligent consumers, know,
"Well, OK. MLB.com's not working. I'm gonna

00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:12.009
go for the breaking story about the steroids
scandal."

00:49:12.009 --> 00:49:16.390
But for the 90% of the rest of it, I can get
it there. And so it's this, it's gonna be

00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:23.430
this big patchwork of who knows what and nobody
knows what it all is, but I'm with Tim in

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:29.280
being optimistic about this because there
is this huge demand for it. And where there

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:34.699
is this kind of demand, our society always
figures out a way to fill it.

00:49:34.699 --> 00:49:44.849
And 200 years ago, compared to us, they were
uneducated, ignorant, racist, sexist pig farmers

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:48.039
and they figured out a way to cover their
society.

00:49:48.039 --> 00:49:50.529
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: We need to return to that,
frankly. I need that back.

00:49:50.529 --> 00:49:51.529
[laughter]

00:49:51.529 --> 00:49:53.689
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: I think we can do it, too.
It's just taking time.

00:49:53.689 --> 00:50:00.940
&gt;&gt;MALE AUDIENCE MEMBER #4: You sort of touched
on this, but I was wondering how important

00:50:00.940 --> 00:50:06.359
it'll be for an aspiring writer to live in
a major market. So as before, the idea was

00:50:06.359 --> 00:50:12.829
to work for the New York Times or the LA Times,
'cause these are large market newspapers with

00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:14.199
large market sports teams.

00:50:14.199 --> 00:50:18.269
You could cover the Yankees, Lakers or something.
And that could still be important because

00:50:18.269 --> 00:50:22.079
these teams still play in those areas, but
if you're an aspiring sports writer or any

00:50:22.079 --> 00:50:27.910
other kind of writer, you wanna be affiliated
with a major title. I know Ethan, you're affiliated

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:32.539
with a national, ESPN is a national title
and no one considers it like the Bristol,

00:50:32.539 --> 00:50:36.529
Connecticut newspaper or whatever.

00:50:36.529 --> 00:50:43.079
But if you wanted to be, take the next step
and become a major national writer, would

00:50:43.079 --> 00:50:47.150
you have to be based in Los Angeles, or New
York, or Chicago? Or, could you still be,

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:53.769
let's say, come from Minneapolis or something?
Would you have to be located in one of those

00:50:53.769 --> 00:50:54.769
major markets?

00:50:54.769 --> 00:50:57.229
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: I'll just come in quickly.
It might not be an exact example, but maybe

00:50:57.229 --> 00:51:02.420
the best, maybe my favorite and maybe the
best sports writer in America right now is

00:51:02.420 --> 00:51:03.900
Joe Posnanski out of Kansas City.

00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:06.050
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: I was gonna say the exact
same thing.

00:51:06.050 --> 00:51:11.609
&gt;&gt;Tim Kawakami: Yeah. Kansas City Star columnist
was writing miraculous stuff out of there.

00:51:11.609 --> 00:51:17.729
I couldn't believe how good it was out of
that paper. And Jason Whitlock was there also

00:51:17.729 --> 00:51:18.729
at the same time.

00:51:18.729 --> 00:51:27.400
And I can't say anymore. He's went to FoxSports.com.
If you have a big vision, if you have a big

00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:31.999
talent, he would be big, I think, in any town.
But because of now of the internet is just

00:51:31.999 --> 00:51:35.980
a press of the button, and he's the same to
me as what The Chronicle is, he's probably

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:36.980
even easier for me to read.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:42.249
And at SI now, but he was even easier because
San Francisco Chronicle's got a pay wall that

00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:48.819
I don't subscribe to. If you are, again, it's
my free market vision, is that yeah, it's

00:51:48.819 --> 00:51:53.369
because he writes about big things in a big
way, in a way that is compelling to me. Joe

00:51:53.369 --> 00:51:54.700
Posnanski's in Kansas City.

00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:59.670
He couldn't be bigger. If he goes to New York,
he wouldn't be any bigger than he is right

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:04.749
now because he's ridiculously good in Kansas
City, because he's found what to write. He

00:52:04.749 --> 00:52:07.939
writes about big things and he just so happens
to be based out of Kansas City.

00:52:07.939 --> 00:52:11.430
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: And I think it's a really
interesting question because I think 20 years

00:52:11.430 --> 00:52:16.589
ago, Joe would've had to go to New York to
get that job at Sports Illustrated, which

00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:22.631
is his dream job. I think he probably would've
had to move to New York and now he's writing

00:52:22.631 --> 00:52:25.970
for the Kansas City Star and then he started
his own blog, also.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:31.089
And SI came after him and they're happy to
have him living and working in Kansas City

00:52:31.089 --> 00:52:35.829
writing for this national magazine. And I
think that's much easier to do today. I mean,

00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:41.400
he travels all over. He goes to wherever the
events are, but that's easier to do now than

00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:44.350
it probably was 20 or 30 years ago.

00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:48.770
&gt;&gt;Ethan Sherwood Strauss: Yeah, I think that's
a great question. And it's a complicated one

00:52:48.770 --> 00:52:55.140
to unwrap. It sort of depends on what your
approach is. I think Posnanski, he only wants

00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:56.191
to be known as a writer.

00:52:56.191 --> 00:53:01.900
I heard on a recent interview on Jonah Keri's
podcast he was saying that he doesn't like

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:06.769
doing the radio stuff and I think doesn't
like doing the TV stuff. But if you do want

00:53:06.769 --> 00:53:12.019
to expand your brand and be one of those TV
or radio guys, it might work out better to

00:53:12.019 --> 00:53:13.640
be in one of those bigger markets.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:20.219
Jason Whitlock's the counter example. I think
he moved to LA in part because there are more

00:53:20.219 --> 00:53:26.710
TV opportunities there and Fox can help him
extend his brand. But as an aspiring sports

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:31.709
writer, as a younger guy, I mean you can't
even be that choosy. You just have to work

00:53:31.709 --> 00:53:32.809
where people will hear you.

00:53:32.809 --> 00:53:40.189
And I know Royce Young does great work covering
the Oklahoma City Thunders. He lives in Oklahoma

00:53:40.189 --> 00:53:45.569
City. He just started blogging about them
and his work was good enough to give him recognition

00:53:45.569 --> 00:53:48.719
and it helps that they're a good team that
people pay attention to.

00:53:48.719 --> 00:53:54.880
But I think that if you're starting out? If
you're starting out, market is almost ancillary

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:59.609
to what you're trying to accomplish. I think
for athletes, big market is more important.

00:53:59.609 --> 00:54:01.549
Is there another question?

00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:08.609
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: Yeah. I think the hour's
up, so I just wanna thank King and Ethan and

00:54:08.609 --> 00:54:10.279
Tim for coming to talk to us.

00:54:10.279 --> 00:54:15.960
&gt;&gt;King Kaufman: Thank you for having us.

00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:16.779
