00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:01.806
- [Instructor] In other videos

00:00:01.806 --> 00:00:04.393
we have first started talking
about the legislative branch

00:00:04.393 --> 00:00:06.680
of the United States federal government.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.073
We talk about how it has two houses,

00:00:09.073 --> 00:00:11.802
the Senate that has 100 members,

00:00:11.802 --> 00:00:14.580
two per state, two times 50,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.353
and the House of Representatives
that has 435 members.

00:00:19.353 --> 00:00:22.089
And states have a certain
number of representatives

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.435
depending on their population.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.988
We're going to go into a little more depth

00:00:26.988 --> 00:00:30.304
in this video is exactly
how laws get passed,

00:00:30.304 --> 00:00:32.381
in particular how do bills get passed

00:00:32.381 --> 00:00:35.272
by one or both of these houses.

00:00:35.272 --> 00:00:37.136
And if you're looking at
the U.S. Capitol building

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:39.850
from the lawn, you can assume
that the Washington Monument

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.144
is behind you in this
picture right over here,

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.898
the Senate chamber is on the
left side, just like that,

00:00:44.898 --> 00:00:47.538
and the House of Representatives
is on the right side.

00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:50.503
Well, what does a bill actually look like?

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:54.511
So, right over here is
the cover of a House bill,

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.546
and notice some interesting things.

00:00:56.546 --> 00:01:01.375
The House bill starts with H.R.,
House of Representatives 1.

00:01:01.375 --> 00:01:03.366
And so this is the first
bill being introduced

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:07.770
in this first session
of the 108th Congress.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.418
And it says, and it's
a little hard to read,

00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:11.353
especially if you're looking
at this on a mobile phone,

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:15.679
but it says, to amend Title
XVIII of the Social Security Act

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.017
to provide for voluntary program

00:01:18.017 --> 00:01:19.783
for prescription drug coverage

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:23.249
under the Medicare program to
modernize the Medicare program

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:24.874
and for other purposes.

00:01:24.874 --> 00:01:26.295
So that's just a very quick summary.

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:29.785
And then it talks about
who are the representatives

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.474
that are introducing the bill.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:33.506
So it's Mr. Hastert and
then it's in parentheses,

00:01:33.506 --> 00:01:35.969
it says for himself and
then it says, Mr. DeLay,

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:38.579
Mr. Blunt, and it keeps
going on and on and on.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.876
And this was introduced June 25, 2003.

00:01:41.876 --> 00:01:44.253
And over here, the
bottom of where it talks

00:01:44.253 --> 00:01:46.676
about who is introducing
this bill, it says,

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:49.313
which was referred jointly

00:01:49.313 --> 00:01:51.985
to the Committee on Energy and Commerce,

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:55.416
and Ways and Means, in
each case for consideration

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.342
of such provisions as fall
within the jurisdiction

00:01:58.342 --> 00:01:59.961
of the committee concerned.

00:01:59.961 --> 00:02:03.481
So this is the first clue
of how bills get started.

00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:06.640
In theory, anyone could write a bill,

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.763
in practice, they are written

00:02:08.763 --> 00:02:12.103
by a member of Congress's
aides or aides of a committee,

00:02:12.103 --> 00:02:13.627
and we're gonna talk
more about committees.

00:02:13.627 --> 00:02:15.746
But they need to be formerly introduced

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:16.913
by members of Congress.

00:02:16.913 --> 00:02:18.428
And you can see here Mr. Hastert,

00:02:18.428 --> 00:02:20.439
Congressman Hastert is listed first.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.960
But it doesn't go straight to a vote

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.814
by the full House of Representatives.

00:02:24.814 --> 00:02:27.520
It will be introduced to
an appropriate committee,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.907
which is a subset of the
House of Representatives.

00:02:29.907 --> 00:02:31.733
In this case it's going to go to both

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.143
the Committee on Energy and Commerce

00:02:33.143 --> 00:02:35.505
and the Ways and Means Committee.

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:38.743
We can similarly look at a Senate bill,

00:02:38.743 --> 00:02:40.597
and it has some similarities.

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:41.949
And the key thing to appreciate is

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.859
that a bill could be introduced
into the House initially

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.607
or into the Senate initially.

00:02:46.607 --> 00:02:48.775
And sometimes you have parallel bills

00:02:48.775 --> 00:02:50.724
that are essentially trying
to do the same thing,

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:54.020
going through both
chambers at the same time.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.112
But right over here,
this is a Senate bill,

00:02:56.112 --> 00:03:00.112
Senate bill 1833, this
is in the 115th Congress,

00:03:01.357 --> 00:03:03.721
to modify the requirements applicable

00:03:03.721 --> 00:03:06.684
to locatable minerals
on public domain land

00:03:06.684 --> 00:03:08.474
and for other purposes.

00:03:08.474 --> 00:03:11.539
And then this is September 19th, 2017.

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.764
It says, Mr. Udall for himself,

00:03:13.764 --> 00:03:15.102
and then it lists other senators,

00:03:15.102 --> 00:03:16.764
introduced the following bill

00:03:16.764 --> 00:03:19.679
which was read twice and
referred to the committee

00:03:19.679 --> 00:03:22.125
on Energy and Natural Resources.

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:23.831
And then you start seeing
the text of the bill.

00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:26.427
So once again, whether it
initially gets introduced

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:28.835
into the Senate or into the House,

00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.015
the first place where it goes is

00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:32.513
to the appropriate committee.

00:03:32.513 --> 00:03:35.219
And in general, it will only get voted on

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.775
by the entire Senate or the entire House

00:03:37.775 --> 00:03:39.611
if it is approved by a committee.

00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:42.878
If a majority of the committee
actually votes for it.

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.527
Now what are these committees?

00:03:44.527 --> 00:03:46.321
So in the House of Representatives,

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:48.801
you currently have over 20 committees

00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:50.544
at the time that I'm making this video.

00:03:50.544 --> 00:03:52.897
Right now you have 20 standing committees,

00:03:52.897 --> 00:03:55.391
which means they are
continuously in operation,

00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:58.571
and one select committee,
which means it might be created

00:03:58.571 --> 00:03:59.778
for a special purpose,

00:03:59.778 --> 00:04:01.138
although some of these select committees

00:04:01.138 --> 00:04:02.893
tend to last for awhile.

00:04:02.893 --> 00:04:04.391
Now what I'm gonna list here are some

00:04:04.391 --> 00:04:06.291
of the most powerful committees

00:04:06.291 --> 00:04:07.852
in the House of Representatives.

00:04:07.852 --> 00:04:11.311
You have the House Ways
and Means Committee.

00:04:11.311 --> 00:04:12.965
Now why is this important?

00:04:12.965 --> 00:04:14.780
What is a Ways and Means?

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.615
This is the committee that
first considers legislation

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:19.509
around taxation.

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:20.985
So it's the ways and means

00:04:20.985 --> 00:04:23.808
by which the government
can actually fund itself.

00:04:23.808 --> 00:04:25.964
And so you can imagine this
is very, very powerful.

00:04:25.964 --> 00:04:27.433
Who gets taxed, by how much,

00:04:27.433 --> 00:04:29.705
how much revenue is actually coming in?

00:04:29.705 --> 00:04:31.011
What will that do to the economy?

00:04:31.011 --> 00:04:33.082
And this is a committee
that's very specific

00:04:33.082 --> 00:04:34.883
to the House of Representatives.

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:37.373
In general, bills could be
introduced to the Senate

00:04:37.373 --> 00:04:39.266
or the House or both.

00:04:39.266 --> 00:04:41.551
But if it's something regarding taxation,

00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:44.583
that has to originate in
the House of Representatives

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:48.338
and it will go through the
House Ways and Means Committee.

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:51.139
Another very powerful committee
is the Budget Committee.

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.086
Through tax policy, the House
Ways and Means Committee

00:04:54.086 --> 00:04:57.397
influences how the
government gets its revenue,

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:59.413
but the Budget Committee decides

00:04:59.413 --> 00:05:02.087
what is actually the
budget of the government.

00:05:02.087 --> 00:05:04.499
The president can make a proposed budget,

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.186
but it's the budget committee
that actually decides

00:05:07.186 --> 00:05:11.353
on what budget Congress will
actually vote on in the House.

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.617
Now, once you have a budget,
you have to think about

00:05:14.617 --> 00:05:16.607
how you're gonna spend that money.

00:05:16.607 --> 00:05:19.188
And that's what the Appropriations
Committee is focused on.

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:21.459
Which programs get how much funding?

00:05:21.459 --> 00:05:23.909
So once again, this is a very
powerful committee to be on.

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:27.992
But perhaps the most
powerful committee of all is

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:30.607
the Rules Committee.

00:05:30.607 --> 00:05:32.103
The reason why this is so powerful

00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:33.916
is that in the House of Representatives,

00:05:33.916 --> 00:05:37.218
even if a bill is
introduced into committee,

00:05:37.218 --> 00:05:40.660
and even if that committee
decides to vote on that bill,

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.567
and let's say they pass
it by a simple majority,

00:05:43.567 --> 00:05:45.464
it doesn't go straight to the floor

00:05:45.464 --> 00:05:47.268
of the House of Representatives to a vote.

00:05:47.268 --> 00:05:49.363
The Rules Committee is actually,

00:05:49.363 --> 00:05:51.420
you can view them as the traffic cop

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.935
for the House of Representatives.

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:56.528
For the most part, they decide
which bills go to the floor

00:05:56.528 --> 00:05:59.101
of the House, what are the rules
by which they are voted on.

00:05:59.101 --> 00:06:00.883
Are people allowed to make amendments,

00:06:00.883 --> 00:06:03.075
which are add-ons to that bill?

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:04.938
Are people even allowed to debate it?

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:07.549
They can even decide whether
it's going to be voted on

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:09.936
by the House of Representatives acting

00:06:09.936 --> 00:06:11.376
as the House of Representatives,

00:06:11.376 --> 00:06:12.699
or whether it's gonna be voted on

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.343
as the Committee of
the Whole, so to speak,

00:06:15.343 --> 00:06:17.676
which is the entire
House of Representatives.

00:06:17.676 --> 00:06:20.764
The difference between
voting for something

00:06:20.764 --> 00:06:23.952
as a House of Representatives
or the Committee of the Whole,

00:06:23.952 --> 00:06:25.941
in either case, it would
happen in the same room

00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:28.492
is that there's different
procedures on how to do it.

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:30.323
And so you can imagine
there's a lot of strategy

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:32.164
depending on which party is in charge

00:06:32.164 --> 00:06:34.804
on what initially even
gets through a committee,

00:06:34.804 --> 00:06:36.121
and then once it gets through a committee,

00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:38.851
what's the procedure
by which it is voted on

00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:40.117
or whether it gets voted on at all.

00:06:40.117 --> 00:06:41.707
Does it have a very public debate,

00:06:41.707 --> 00:06:43.251
or is there very little debate?

00:06:43.251 --> 00:06:46.384
Now, if something does pass the House,

00:06:46.384 --> 00:06:48.983
then that same bill,
once it passes the House,

00:06:48.983 --> 00:06:50.913
would have to be voted on by the Senate.

00:06:50.913 --> 00:06:53.927
Now, similarly, in the Senate,
when a bill is introduced,

00:06:53.927 --> 00:06:55.389
it goes to committee.

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.896
And in the Senate currently,

00:06:56.896 --> 00:06:58.454
there are 16 standing committees

00:06:58.454 --> 00:07:01.690
and over 20 total committees
at the time of this video.

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.189
And just to get a sense of some

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:05.295
of the more powerful
committees on the Senate,

00:07:05.295 --> 00:07:08.661
you have things like the
Appropriations Committee,

00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.779
which is a sister committee

00:07:09.779 --> 00:07:11.472
of the House Appropriations Committee

00:07:11.472 --> 00:07:12.801
that we talked about before.

00:07:12.801 --> 00:07:15.767
Once again, they will
try to think about well,

00:07:15.767 --> 00:07:18.400
how could that money be spent?

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.294
You have the Foreign Relations Committee.

00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:23.457
One key distinction between
the Senate and the House,

00:07:23.457 --> 00:07:26.308
there's a lot of areas where
they both might legislate on

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:27.866
or introduce legislation on,

00:07:27.866 --> 00:07:31.628
but in general, tax bills can
only originate in the House,

00:07:31.628 --> 00:07:34.962
while the Senate is closer to
things like foreign relations.

00:07:34.962 --> 00:07:36.820
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee,

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:38.838
all treaties would go through them.

00:07:38.838 --> 00:07:41.419
The Senate Armed Services Committee,

00:07:41.419 --> 00:07:44.317
it has legislative
authority over the military.

00:07:44.317 --> 00:07:47.765
Now once something gets through
any of these committees,

00:07:47.765 --> 00:07:50.124
then it would go through the Senate floor.

00:07:50.124 --> 00:07:52.546
And even there you start
to appreciate a difference

00:07:52.546 --> 00:07:54.353
between the House and the Senate.

00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:56.077
In the Senate, not only do you have

00:07:56.077 --> 00:07:57.948
a fewer number of senators,

00:07:57.948 --> 00:08:00.201
they tend to be more generalists

00:08:00.201 --> 00:08:03.289
and it's easier for something
to get to the Senate floor.

00:08:03.289 --> 00:08:04.967
It's a little bit more collegial.

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:08.635
In the House, if the majority
party is strongly controlling

00:08:08.635 --> 00:08:11.855
the Rules Committee, they
can very strongly control

00:08:11.855 --> 00:08:13.905
not just what gets to the floor,

00:08:13.905 --> 00:08:16.384
but what is debated, how it's debated,

00:08:16.384 --> 00:08:19.488
if it's debated and what
has amendments put on it.

00:08:19.488 --> 00:08:21.804
And also, the members who
serve on these committees,

00:08:21.804 --> 00:08:24.193
it's a little bit more specialized.

00:08:24.193 --> 00:08:28.534
Now in either case, once a
bill gets through either house,

00:08:28.534 --> 00:08:30.315
it has to be voted on by the other house.

00:08:30.315 --> 00:08:32.551
So if a bill gets approved by the Senate,

00:08:32.551 --> 00:08:34.411
then it will go to the House,

00:08:34.411 --> 00:08:37.056
and if that same bill
is approved by the House

00:08:37.056 --> 00:08:40.680
with a simple majority, then
it will go to the President.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.655
Now the President might sign the bill,

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:44.288
in which case it would become law,

00:08:44.288 --> 00:08:46.770
or the President could veto that bill.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:50.000
If the President vetoes
the bill, it goes back

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.103
to both of these houses
and to override the veto,

00:08:53.103 --> 00:08:54.894
each of these houses,

00:08:54.894 --> 00:08:58.156
they both have to vote
with a 2/3 majority,

00:08:58.156 --> 00:09:00.354
and that happens very seldom.

00:09:00.354 --> 00:09:02.179
Now you also have a
scenario where sometimes

00:09:02.179 --> 00:09:03.751
very similar bills are going

00:09:03.751 --> 00:09:05.657
through both houses at the same time.

00:09:05.657 --> 00:09:08.963
So there's a situation where
a similar bill has gone

00:09:08.963 --> 00:09:11.172
through both houses at the same time,

00:09:11.172 --> 00:09:14.530
what it goes to is something
called a conference committee.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:16.327
And a conference committee is a group

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:18.679
of both senators and representatives

00:09:18.679 --> 00:09:21.114
who will get together and
they'll try to reconcile

00:09:21.114 --> 00:09:23.506
the differences between those two bills.

00:09:23.506 --> 00:09:27.302
And once they get one bill
that reconciles the differences

00:09:27.302 --> 00:09:29.154
between those two, then they'll go back

00:09:29.154 --> 00:09:31.560
for a vote to both houses.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.128
And if they pass both
houses, then once again,

00:09:34.128 --> 00:09:38.285
it will go to the President
who could decide to sign it

00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:40.838
or veto it, and once
again, if it gets vetoed,

00:09:40.838 --> 00:09:43.614
that veto could get overridden.

00:09:43.614 --> 00:09:45.798
So the big picture here is we've talked

00:09:45.798 --> 00:09:48.666
about that policy making
process in previous videos

00:09:48.666 --> 00:09:51.099
where at first you wanna identify an issue

00:09:51.099 --> 00:09:53.058
and then you wanna do policy formulation.

00:09:53.058 --> 00:09:57.301
Well, a lot of that is going
on in the U.S. Congress.

00:09:57.301 --> 00:10:00.451
You have congressional aides
who are identifying problems,

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:02.917
maybe different constituents,
maybe lobbyists are saying,

00:10:02.917 --> 00:10:04.056
hey, can you fix this

00:10:04.056 --> 00:10:05.864
or can you change the
tax code in some way?

00:10:05.864 --> 00:10:08.216
Then they formulate a policy

00:10:08.216 --> 00:10:10.637
which is essentially these bills.

00:10:10.637 --> 00:10:13.177
These bills are essentially
a policy formulation,

00:10:13.177 --> 00:10:15.719
and then those policies
have to be adopted.

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:17.530
To be adopted, it has to be approved

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.298
by both houses of Congress

00:10:19.298 --> 00:10:21.194
and then signed by the President.

00:10:21.194 --> 00:10:22.706
Or if it's vetoed by the President,

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:26.240
that veto has to be overridden
by both houses of Congress.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.242
And then it's up to the Executive Branch

00:10:28.242 --> 00:10:30.499
to implement that policy.

00:10:30.499 --> 00:10:32.163
I'll leave you there.

00:10:32.163 --> 00:10:35.445
And in future videos we'll
talk more about the mechanics

00:10:35.445 --> 00:10:36.734
of the U.S. Congress.
