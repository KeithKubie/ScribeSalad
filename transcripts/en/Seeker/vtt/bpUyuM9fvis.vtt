Mantis shrimps are amazing creatures, they’re
like the Muhammad Ali of the animal kingdom,

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:13.990
if Muhammad Ali could diagnose cancer.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.250
Hi there marine oncologists, Julian here for
DNews.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.300
We already knew that cancerous tissue reflects
polarized light differently than healthy tissue,

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.250
and doctors use this knowledge to detect tumors
using complex imaging systems.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.270
Now scientists think they can improve those
systems with inspiration drawn from the mantis

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.270
shrimp.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.680
Mantis shrimp, which are technically not shrimps…
is it shrimp or shrimps?

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:36.910
Oh both are good?

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.840
Thank you, Merriam-Webster.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.270
Mantis shrimps are actually stomatopods…
stomatopods?

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.690
Oh let’s call the whole thing off.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.870
Along with a wicked punch that can crack aquarium
glass, these animals are gifted with incredible

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.870
eyesight.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.790
We can just see a small range of electromagnetic
waves that we call the visible spectrum because

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.230
our eyes have four different visual pigments,
3 of which are for color, and our lenses block

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.390
UV light.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.619
Mantis Shrimps by comparison have 16 visual
pigments; 12 for colors, half of which are

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.479
sensitive to UV light, and half for differentiating
polarized light.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.020
Light from the sun or a light bulb is unpolarized,
meaning the light wave is actually the superposition

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.049
of many waves.

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.750
So if you could actually see the waves like
they were coming right at you, they would

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.670
be vibrating in a lot of different planes.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.670
But they can be polarized in a lot of ways,
like being reflected off a mirror.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.560
When this happens, light waves in just one
plane get bounced back to our eyes.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.010
We’re not really sensitive to it unless
there are too many polarized waves and we

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.289
get glare, which we cut down by wearing polarized
sunglasses that don’t allow light on that

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:42.389
plane in.

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:47.119
Mantis shrimps are way more sensitive to polarized
light and can differentiate objects by it

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.950
the same way we can differentiate by color.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.709
Because of this, Professor Justin Marshall,
from the Queensland Brain Institute said they

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:57.159
can simply look at something and tell if it
was cancerous.

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.399
“A mantis shrimp could walk up to it and
hit it," Marshall said.

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.039
I don’t think the shrimp is really getting
this whole fighting cancer thing.

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.569
The camera researchers are developing models
the mantis shrimps eyes, translating the minute

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.329
changes in reflected polarized light into
colors we can see and understand.

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:17.730
This could help guide surgeries and reduce
the need for invasive procedures like biopsies,

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.210
while still providing accurate early detection.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.540
And as anyone who’s fought or knows someone
who’s fought cancer, early detection is

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.540
key.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.459
Stay safe and educated about cancer.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.510
Laci’s got you covered with this video about
how much solar radiation it takes to get skin

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.510
cancer.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.680
Are there other awesome animal abilities anthropomorphs
adapted?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.019
Let us know your favorite example in the comments,
and I’ll see you next time on DNews.
