[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.247 --> 00:00:12.400
KEITH WRIGHT: So Michael has had
a very wild, I'd say, history,

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.550
especially early
on in his career.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.110
You were sort of exposed to
staggering levels of corruption

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.170
straight out of college,
first in Washington, DC,

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.500
here domestically, when you
were working on K Street,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.760
and then in the UN, more
on a global scale, when

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.790
you were working on one of the
largest humanitarian operations

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.950
in human history.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.630
And then you decided to
become a whistleblower

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.090
based on some of the stuff
that you were exposed to.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.800
I mean, it's pretty crazy story.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.860
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: It's not
a normal career track.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.820
I know.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.236
KEITH WRIGHT: And
then you decided

00:00:49.236 --> 00:00:51.750
to write a book about it.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.724
The book's called
"Backstabbing for Beginners."

00:00:53.724 --> 00:00:54.640
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.340
KEITH WRIGHT: An
appropriate title.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.830
And then it was
picked up and turned

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.390
into a movie, which was recently
released by A24 starring

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.570
Ben Kingsley as your
boss, Theo James

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:14.110
is yourself, and then Jacqueline
Bisset as well, right?

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.485
So yeah, I'm very happy
to have you here today.

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:17.610
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Thank you.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.250
KEITH WRIGHT: We're
going to be talking

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.690
about some very light subjects.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:20.550
[LAUGHING]

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.380
I'm just joking.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.440
We'll talk about a couple
of different topics

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.930
on global corruption, what that
means on a global scale, how

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.700
it's related to us here at home,
and a number of other things.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.740
So the Oil for
Food program, this

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.214
was happening before and
after the war in Iraq.

00:01:41.214 --> 00:01:42.130
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.680
KEITH WRIGHT: It dealt
with Saddam Hussein.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.402
After you released some
information through,

00:01:47.402 --> 00:01:49.360
I believe it was an op
ed with "The Wall Street

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.550
Journal," it sort of exposed
corruption on a global scale,

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.360
involving over 2,500
companies around the globe

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.330
and over 66 countries as well.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.530
And there's definitely
some very sketchy

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.610
powerful political figures that
were involved on both sides.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.985
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Very well-known.

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:10.650
Yes, sir.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.691
KEITH WRIGHT: So I guess
my first question to you

00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:15.110
is like, how similar
is the film to reality?

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.810
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Well, it's more
similar than I'd like it to be.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.740
The most similar
thing, of course,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.000
is that I was exactly as
cute as Theo James is.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.260
[LAUGHING]

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.480
No, seriously.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.760
There were far more explosions.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.520
There were far more people
that disappeared or found

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.470
themselves investigated.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.170
You know, the judge
investigating the corruption

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.280
that had gone on in Iraq for
years was blown up in a car

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.410
after the war.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.410
The CIA, the KGB.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.620
Everybody knew about it,
was involved to some extent

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.840
in abetting it.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.750
And it was one big open secret.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.350
Just to take you back a
little bit, when I was 17,

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.400
I came to my dad and
had written a script.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.936
And my dad was a writer in
France and he said, no, no, no.

00:03:17.936 --> 00:03:19.060
You should not be a writer.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.330
It's too risky.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.800
You should be a lawyer.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.770
You should be an
international lawyer.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.800
So I go to Brown, and we
had a fantastic president,

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.200
Vartan Gregorian,
who then encourages

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.220
us to go out there and make
a difference in the world.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.220
So I'm thinking, OK.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.190
Let's find ourselves a good
law firm and get some practice

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.430
and go to law school.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.290
And so I land on K Street
at a law firm that belonged

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.920
to the father of Bill Gates.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.390
So I thought, cool.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.570
I'm safe this is probably
going to be straight shooting

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:55.510
law practice.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.230
The head of our client group
was called Jack Abramoff.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.049
Nine years later, Casino
Jack, as he came to be known,

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.340
ended up on the cover of
"Time" magazine as the man who

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.830
bought Washington.

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:11.140
So when I went to
the UN, I was really

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.180
trying to flee this
aspect of politics.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.680
And I was ecstatic,
because I had

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.430
landed a job in what
would be the largest

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.220
humanitarian program
in the UN's history.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:33.520
And then things started to
become a little clearer to me.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:36.970
Why was it the largest
humanitarian program

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:37.750
in UN history?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.500
Because we had destroyed
the entire infrastructure

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.760
of a warm, hot in
some areas, country

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.300
that relied entirely on oil.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.620
But we came up with a solution.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.650
The solution was not
to lift the sanctions,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.130
because we didn't trust Saddam
to not rebuild an arsenal.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:59.340
The solution was to
let them sell oil,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.510
to take the money
into UN bank account,

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.330
and from there, to oversee
all of the purchase

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.820
and import of all
of the products

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.822
that the population needed.

00:05:12.822 --> 00:05:14.530
So when I was sitting
with a spreadsheet,

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:17.550
that's the fate of an
entire country there.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.020
You're 24 years old.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.580
And if you made
a mistake, that's

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.676
people not eating for a month,
and some of the eighteen

00:05:25.676 --> 00:05:28.750
[INAUDIBLE] that were Iraq.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.800
We quickly noticed that
there was one party that

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.070
didn't have a seat at the
table, in the Security

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.630
Council or anywhere, and
that was the Iraqi people.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:48.950
And that made it possible for
2,300 international companies,

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:51.320
including big companies--

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.100
Siemens, Volvo,
Mercedes, Texaco,

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.070
the people who yielded as part
of the Bush administration

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.260
team.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.920
Every party in the Russian Duma
got funding from Vladimir Putin

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:11.540
through this program in
the form of kickbacks

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:14.580
in the sale of under-priced oil.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.640
So what we saw,
essentially, was that we

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.990
were able to get some
food and some medicine

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:20.100
to the population.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.790
But the cost of it
was that they were

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:28.160
getting the worst type
of expired medicine,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.390
food fit for dogs--

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.750
and that's a quote
from an Iraqi person--

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.280
at the time.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:36.050
Because we were observing them.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:42.230
We had UN observers drive
around Iraq and ask people,

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.530
did you receive your
food basket this month?

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.670
And a food basket, it
wasn't that the basket from

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.370
[INAUDIBLE].

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.370
It was really a ration
in an old oil tank.

00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.890
And we treated, basically,
an entire population

00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:02.936
as animals in a farm.

00:07:02.936 --> 00:07:04.310
KEITH WRIGHT: Was
this only Iraq,

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.352
or was it surrounding
countries as well?

00:07:07.352 --> 00:07:08.810
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
No, this was Iraq.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:11.060
Iraq was under the most
stringent sanctions

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.640
ever imposed on a country
that had just been bombed back

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.830
to the pre-industrial age.

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:18.500
And our job was to get the
civilian population back

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.980
on track.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.810
So we were lobbying
the Security Council

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.670
to loosen the restrictions
and allow more goods.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.030
And there was enough money.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.300
There was more money than
the UN had ever seen.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:36.150
Our quarterly budget was bigger
than the UN's entire budget.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:41.250
Oil money lead to those sums.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.650
It was also very slippery money.

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.570
So on this sale of
oil and on the import

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:49.290
of humanitarian goods
in Iraq, profits

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:55.770
were made illicitly through
corruption and kickbacks,

00:07:55.770 --> 00:08:00.270
and funneled back into people
like the ambassador of France

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:01.920
to the UN.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:02.610
People we knew.

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.550
People we saw everyday.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.240
People that are the
heads of large companies.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.690
In Denmark, Novo is a big
pharmaceutical company.

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:14.610
They were also involved in it.

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.920
So in these 2,500 companies and,
basically, this is my world.

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.140
This is the corporate
world as I know it,

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.070
as it existed at the time.

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.590
So, of course, it wasn't
the most comfortable thing

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:29.040
to be in a position to know
that this was going on,

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:34.230
and to know that the whole
counsel knew about it too.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.200
But Saddam a very
wily character.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:42.780
He liked to keep lists
of who he was corrupting.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:49.260
And after the war, that list was
passed on to me and to others,

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:53.460
and found its way to a free
Iraqi newspaper that had just

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:58.690
emerged, and they published it.

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.410
And then, phones started
ringing in all the intelligence

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.040
headquarters of every country
that had overseen this.

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:08.010
And there was general
global panic, the likes

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:10.110
of which I've never seen.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:14.280
The big question was,
was the list real?

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:20.160
And on that list was a name
that sounded a bit too familiar.

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.440
It wasn't spelt exactly
like it should be spelt,

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.320
but it was spelled
the way Iraqis would

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.130
pronounce our big boss's name.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.180
He was the boss of my boss.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.520
He had taken me under his wing.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:38.780
I liked him, and his
name was on the list.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.020
He had also received kickbacks.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:44.240
So the undersecretary general
of the United Nations,

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.460
the man associated with
the-- the man in charge

00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:49.500
of the whole program had
apparently taken kickbacks.

00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:52.820
I couldn't believe it, and
I wanted an investigation,

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.000
because I thought
it would clear him.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.930
It turned out that Kofi
Annan's son, Kojo, was also

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:04.430
involved in a company that had
gotten some favorable deals,

00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.520
and so Kofi Annan had no choice.

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:10.040
Once I came up with
an op ed, being

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.136
the first member of
the UN to actually say,

00:10:13.136 --> 00:10:14.510
the cat's out of
the bag, we need

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:19.280
to have a completely independent
investigation of this,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.870
then he took up that cause.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:25.310
And Paul Volcker, who is the
former head of the Federal

00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:29.540
Reserve, who is, by the
way, 7 feet tall and super

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.150
intimidating, walked into the
Security Council and asked him,

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.360
are you are you sure you want
me to investigate this stuff?

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:44.360
And they didn't
have instructions

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:47.690
from their headquarters,
and they passed a resolution

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:48.320
saying yes.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:54.710
And suddenly, we had 60
Scotland Yard FBI forensics

00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:58.280
investigators taking all of our
computers, all of our files,

00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.610
and looking through
everything from companies

00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:04.820
from all over the world, and
they uncovered everything.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:10.220
So this was the first time such
an investigation on corruption

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:13.820
had been done on a global scale.

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:16.660
And I think one of the
reasons we're here today

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:20.455
is to try to draw some lessons
and understand why it matters.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:24.390
Because--

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.390
KEITH WRIGHT: Can you
actually talk a little bit

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:28.750
about the op ed that you wrote?

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:32.200
Where it was released, and how
you sort of went about that?

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.680
Because it sounds like that
was a moment in time when

00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.801
the whistle was sort
of blown, right?

00:11:38.801 --> 00:11:40.300
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
You could say that.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.310
There were some
investigative journalists.

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:44.530
There were some
investigations in Congress,

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:46.540
but nobody at the UN
had opened their mouth

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.390
and said this is true,
and we knew about it.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.940
And they knew that I was
not an enemy of the UN,

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:55.690
or wanted harm to
the organization,

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:59.310
so it had a certain
amount of credibility.

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.950
And the cat's out of
the bag is also language

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:06.130
that people with a decent
amount of intel training

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:11.250
recognize as the code
word for the secret's out.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:16.180
And so I think it had an impact.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.970
It's a request I
had made internally.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:18.810
I had called him up.

00:12:18.810 --> 00:12:20.260
I wasn't working there anymore.

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.194
I had quit.

00:12:22.194 --> 00:12:24.360
And I told them, guys, you
need to investigate this.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.670
And they're like,
oh, it'll blow over.

00:12:26.670 --> 00:12:31.680
KEITH WRIGHT: There was this
pin drive involved in the film,

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.610
that it seemed like you were
sort of kind of running around

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.560
from country to
country, and you were

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.210
able to get back to the States
with this list on this pin

00:12:40.210 --> 00:12:40.710
drive.

00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:42.210
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
So that's the film.

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:46.920
In reality, there was a Kurdish
spy, as there is in the film.

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:54.120
That person did nearly get
blown up in the car bomb attack.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.650
There were other players.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:59.280
I mean, this was a spy's nest.

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.830
There was so much
money to be had.

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:04.380
We were getting
lunch all over town,

00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:06.147
just to get information
about, how do you

00:13:06.147 --> 00:13:07.230
work through this program?

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.150
Because it was lucrative.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.830
Now the point was, of
course, to be humanitarian.

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.050
And that's where you have
the great imbalance that

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.600
reminds us of
Puritan art history,

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.070
like colonization, where
the white man's burden was

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.280
to go around and help these poor
people while we were stealing

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:29.140
their mineral resources.

00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.880
The same logic applies to
all sorts of corruption,

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:37.320
and we're going to get to some
of them later, that affect us

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:43.920
today in ways that we do not
understand the importance of.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.580
We should be a lot more
frightened than we are.

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.610
But let me just
give one example.

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:56.360
After we invaded
Iraq, liberated Iraq--

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.870
and it was, in the beginning,
seen as a liberation

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.440
by a lot of Iraqis.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.260
But these same
Iraqis had grown up

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.650
for 13 years between
two wars looking

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.540
at what was going
on around them,

00:14:09.540 --> 00:14:12.840
looking at where their
natural resources were going,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:15.270
and looking at what
they were getting.

00:14:15.270 --> 00:14:21.120
And they saw the West being in
cahoots with their own dictator

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.220
at their own expense.

00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:27.520
So how hard was it
for ISIS and al-Qaeda

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:31.800
to recruit these young guys
and make a complete mess out

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.410
of the country for 10 years?

00:14:34.410 --> 00:14:38.340
It was very easy because
the entire ideology of ISIS

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:40.170
and of al-Qaeda--

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:43.370
first of all, very
similar ideologies.

00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:44.910
They're just competing groups.

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:47.580
But their ideology is
based on the notion

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:50.840
of Western corruption.

00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:56.900
Boko Haram, which is the African
part of the terrorist networks,

00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:02.780
now growing at a very rapid
pace in sub-Saharan Africa,

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.060
means rejection of
all things Western.

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.630
Literally, the words mean that.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:13.340
They feel that the West has
corrupted their righteous place

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:17.120
in the world, that there was
a golden age of their culture,

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:21.110
and that we have, in
cahoots with dictators,

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:26.480
that we imagined were
loved by their people,

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.400
because the people didn't
have no choice but to cap--

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.350
every time Saddam was
at his balcony shooting

00:15:33.350 --> 00:15:36.200
his gun, what do you do?

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:37.287
They were very dangerous.

00:15:37.287 --> 00:15:38.870
I saw the Mukhabarat
at work, and they

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:41.870
were extremely dangerous
people, and fear

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:47.390
prevailed in those countries
like nothing I've ever seen.

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:53.730
Suddenly you open that
up, and the reactions

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.190
are very interesting.

00:15:55.190 --> 00:15:56.300
People become tribal.

00:15:56.300 --> 00:16:02.840
People then-- but the same
thing happened in Russia,

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.730
and the same thing
is happening in a lot

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.330
of places in transition.

00:16:08.330 --> 00:16:09.740
When I graduated
from college, it

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.530
was a very interesting
time in the world.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:14.510
Walls were going down.

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:20.310
Democracy was progressing across
the board, across the world.

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:23.300
Tiananmen Square,
the Berlin Wall.

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.550
It just looked like there
would be no end to things.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.940
People talked of
the end of history.

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.294
People thought, OK, this is it.

00:16:30.294 --> 00:16:32.210
Capitalism and democracy
are going to prevail,

00:16:32.210 --> 00:16:35.240
and we don't have
to lift a finger.

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:39.110
The problem is that corruption
can very, very easily

00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:44.240
erode the progress of
freedom and democracy the way

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.520
we understand it today.

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:49.310
And too easily.

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:51.920
It's as if dark
matter and light are

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.470
in some sort of competition,
and if the light

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:57.410
doesn't shine brightly
enough, if transparency is not

00:16:57.410 --> 00:17:01.700
strong enough, if we stop
trusting our institutions,

00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.579
which today is I
think a current topic,

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:09.290
and if we don't use our
institutions properly

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.099
or in new ways and
strengthen them,

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.190
then the dark matter
rolls back the gains.

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:19.310
We now have in
Europe countries that

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:24.650
used to be democracies that
have turned into strongmen

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:28.550
countries, and that
includes countries

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:31.400
in the middle of Europe.

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:36.020
And I think we're seeing
a global map here.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.740
I work sometimes with
Transparency International,

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.740
and there's something
strange about that

00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:47.290
map that I just want to
point out, to start us off

00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:51.130
in a wider discussion
that maybe touches us more

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:54.280
directly as people here today.

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.820
Notice-- so you
can figure it out.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:56.320
Right?

00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.986
The least corrupt
countries in the world

00:17:57.986 --> 00:18:03.430
are in lighter shades, and
the most corrupt countries

00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:04.900
are in darker shades.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.280
That would be ideal, an
ideal picture of the world,

00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:19.610
if it wasn't for the very
definition of corruption.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:24.930
Corruption is the abuse
of power for private gain,

00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:30.670
the abuse of power at the
expense of the powerless.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:33.480
Now look at the map again.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:39.010
If the most powerful countries
in the world are not corrupt,

00:18:39.010 --> 00:18:41.340
then how come we
have a picture where

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.910
the poorest countries in
the world are corrupt,

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:47.540
and we're not?

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.370
If it's the powerful
abusing those

00:18:49.370 --> 00:18:56.540
without power on a global scale,
this map becomes interesting.

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.950
These countries did not
become corrupt by themselves.

00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:05.030
We play an enormous
role in corrupting them.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:10.790
We work with their regimes
to funnel money off

00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:14.810
to offshore accounts, and
it used to be Switzerland,

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:18.830
but after 9/11, Switzerland
became a bit iffy.

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:21.560
But the use of front
companies, as was

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.820
revealed in the Panama
Papers across the globe,

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.140
allows for this.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:30.790
So we make deals
with the dictators

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.140
at the expense of the people.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.800
And so the resources of
these countries, of course,

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.940
are funneled to us at the
expense of the general welfare

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.560
of the population, creating
the type of resentment

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.620
that leads to extremism.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:53.210
The extremism leads
to civil wars.

00:19:53.210 --> 00:20:01.380
Civil wars leads to
immigration and refugees.

00:20:01.380 --> 00:20:04.920
Today, there are more refugees
in the world than there

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:09.100
was even after World War II.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:13.390
Sex slavery is at its
apex, and new routes

00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:15.790
are being uncovered every day.

00:20:15.790 --> 00:20:18.610
Some of my courageous friends
at CNN went down to Libya

00:20:18.610 --> 00:20:23.980
and saw how sex slaves from
several countries in Africa

00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.520
were being directly
funneled, traded, and sold,

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:29.380
and sold onwards to Italy.

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:32.380
There is sex trade
also from Asia.

00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:37.420
North Korea has been exporting
girls for a long time.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.747
This corruption, we
can ignore it, and just

00:20:40.747 --> 00:20:41.830
think that it's out there.

00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:44.860
It happens far away
from where we live.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:48.940
And as long as we're not
directly a part of it,

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.840
we can live in good conscience.

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.430
But I would challenge
that notion.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:21:00.530
I think that it is a
frightening situation.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.800
And in the very
current situation

00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.510
we have with the current
presidency and the questions

00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:10.840
that have been raised
about corrupt money funding

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:18.150
his entire business empire,
and the entire US intelligence

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:25.710
community agreeing that
these same powers have aided

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:33.240
and abetted his campaign,
not always in straight ways,

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:35.790
manipulating such thing
as what we thought

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:38.490
were genuine
grassroots movements.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:42.070
You know, they've infiltrated
Black Lives Matter.

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:48.480
They infiltrated even
the gun lobby guys.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.310
I thought that was funny.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:54.840
But they understand how to play
our system to create confusion,

00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.900
to create a
demoralizing pattern.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:00.930
This is an old plan.

00:22:00.930 --> 00:22:07.210
That was an old KGB plan
that was shaped in the 1950s

00:22:07.210 --> 00:22:10.990
to demoralize us and
eventually to use

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:17.590
corrupt patterns to confuse us
and leave us in a place where--

00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:22.900
"The Economist" wrote last week
that America is a country where

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:26.460
votes don't seem to count.

00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:29.850
It's the only country where
you elect a president not based

00:22:29.850 --> 00:22:33.210
on the majority, but based
on an electoral college that

00:22:33.210 --> 00:22:36.070
was shaped when?

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:41.020
During the time of slavery, when
they were trying to make sure

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:44.290
slave-owning states had
an equal enough force

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:46.820
to defend themselves.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:49.300
We are dealing with
a constitution that

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:52.270
wasn't perfect, that has
been amended, obviously,

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:55.630
for such things as free
speech, to begin with,

00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:58.730
the abolition of slavery.

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.000
We have a Supreme
Court that used to be

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.580
wrong about some major issues.

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:04.840
They were wrong about slavery.

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.120
They upheld slavery
100 or so years ago.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:14.350
And more recently, they upheld
a case called "Citizens United,"

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:19.720
which allows unlimited
amounts money to be funneled

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.650
into political campaigns.

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:29.840
They argued that
money is speech.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.330
Now, I can show you $1.

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:33.980
$1 is $1.

00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:35.450
Words are words.

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:39.290
Money is not speech.

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.880
I come from a country
that's very, very yellow.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:46.250
Maybe it was part of
why I reacted the way I

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.100
did to some of what I saw.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.490
I adopted America as the
country where I wanted to live.

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:55.790
I thought it stood
for certain values

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.680
that I strongly believed in and
continue to believe in today.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:04.050
But when I look at that
little country, Denmark,

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:07.970
which ranks as the least corrupt
country in the world, and also

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.890
the happiest, despite
really bad weather--

00:24:12.890 --> 00:24:15.620
KEITH WRIGHT: I think
Denmark is the least corrupt

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:16.454
on this entire list.

00:24:16.454 --> 00:24:17.953
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Yeah, I mean, we've

00:24:17.953 --> 00:24:20.400
got some competition from
Norway, you know, sometimes.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:25.460
But why is it?

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:28.130
What can we learn from
the country that's

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:30.380
least corrupt in the world?

00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:33.060
Well, there's no
campaign finance.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.840
You're not allowed to
give money for campaigns.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.390
Money for campaigns
is taken out of taxes.

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:39.170
It's not much.

00:24:39.170 --> 00:24:42.490
You have to go on the air, and
you have to make your case.

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:46.780
And we debate laws before
they pass, not after.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.850
Because there's been a
shooting in a supermarket,

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.640
hence the news forgets
about, oh, there's

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.555
a legislative process that
is about net neutrality,

00:24:54.555 --> 00:24:57.460
is an actually a
super important issue.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:24:58.210
We should debate.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:24:59.110
We should have polls.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:01.270
People should argue their case.

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:02.020
No.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.670
Laws are passed in silence, in
the corridors of power, where

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.800
the lobbyists, whom
I first met when

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:19.240
I was too young to be there,
at about 21, 22, operate.

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:26.140
And now we've entered a world
where, at the same time,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:30.830
we have power of
access to information

00:25:30.830 --> 00:25:32.890
we never had before.

00:25:32.890 --> 00:25:36.280
In the last 10 years,
the power to organize

00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:41.630
through social media are
powers we did not have before.

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:42.200
But--

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:43.616
KEITH WRIGHT:
Talking about power,

00:25:43.616 --> 00:25:45.390
I mean, looking
again at this map,

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:48.620
you have the dark
red countries, which

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.230
are considered the
most domestically

00:25:51.230 --> 00:25:53.610
corrupt governments.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:54.110
Right?

00:25:54.110 --> 00:25:57.740
And the light yellow
countries, the least.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:03.080
And Transparency international
defines corruption

00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:06.710
as the powerful taking
advantage of their power

00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:08.510
for personal gains.

00:26:08.510 --> 00:26:11.390
So looking at these
dark red countries,

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:16.520
they have some of the smallest
GDPs or economies of the world.

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.590
They're not very
powerful countries.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:21.950
So is this actually
telling an accurate story

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:27.350
of what's actually going on,
on a global corruption scale?

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.012
Or is there another map that
should be kind of drawn,

00:26:30.012 --> 00:26:31.970
because if we look at
some of the light colored

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:35.570
countries that are the most
powerful in the world, maybe

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.870
they have some sort of role in
terms of instigating corruption

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:41.670
that happens at a domestic level
in some of these Third World

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:42.170
countries.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:44.610
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: I mean,
it's a very good question.

00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:46.310
And the reason it's
a good question

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.180
is that corruption
works a bit like magic.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.330
We were just talking
about, before we walked in,

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.420
diversion is a very important
part of how corruption works.

00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:02.270
Corruption is not easy to hide.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.310
It involves envelopes
at the end of the day,

00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:07.097
even if it's large
diplomatic pouch

00:27:07.097 --> 00:27:08.930
envelopes, such as the
ones that were flying

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.660
from Baghdad to Moscow
in diplomatic planes

00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:14.210
during the sanctions.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.800
All the kickbacks were literally
put in diplomatic pouches.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.590
The map, to me, is funny.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.540
Even Denmark has
companies like Maersk,

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:31.020
which does most of the
shipping around the world.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.140
They have enormous
pharmaceutical companies.

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:38.880
They have-- all of these
companies were named and fined

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:44.280
as part of the UN aid scandal.

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.380
But the companies
that were stationed

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.860
in Panama or other less
accountable countries

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.500
were, of course, left alone.

00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.070
The whole point of democracy--

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:55.560
I mean, if there
wasn't democracy,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.120
we wouldn't be talking
about corruption.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:27:59.645
Because what is a state?

00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:02.770
The definition of a
state is the entity

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:07.240
that has a monopoly over this
use of power over a given area.

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.370
So as much as we like to
call politics is science,

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:12.640
the only scientific
truth about politics

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.170
in the history of our
species is the theory

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:18.860
of hegemonic stability.

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:22.890
There is stability when there is
a hegemon, one powerful force,

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:28.780
that can keep some peace
because it is simply

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:30.610
too strong to challenge.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:35.680
With democracy came
a new definition

00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:36.940
of what the state is.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.370
Instead of just being
a central mafia,

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:41.740
it is a system of
checks and balances.

00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:44.140
And what are they for?

00:28:44.140 --> 00:28:47.380
The whole point of democracy is
to keep a check on corruption,

00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:51.140
so that people are not
completely screwed out

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:57.520
of their earnings, and that
some social justice can prevail,

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:59.710
and that people can
emerge through the system,

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:04.035
instead of just being kept
down, in the most extreme cases,

00:29:04.035 --> 00:29:07.720
as slaves, or now
in other cases,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:13.030
as people that are so indebted
that their children cannot get

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:15.640
a better education than
they can, and so on.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:18.220
This is the story that's coming
out of rural America today

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:19.330
also.

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.400
We had a protest
vote in this country.

00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:25.300
I don't know how they decided
that Mr. Bananahead reality

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.920
TV was going to
be their champion,

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:30.220
but somehow, it
was a protest vote,

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:33.840
which means that they
feel disenfranchised.

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.480
And we can't ignore this.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:38.490
We also, we can't ignore
that this guy has tendencies

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:44.880
to like dictators, to be more
friendly with Little Rocket man

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:49.710
and other people like that
than he is with our allies.

00:29:49.710 --> 00:29:54.850
What have we done to ourselves,
and how has it happened?

00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.050
It wasn't just a mistake.

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:58.440
There was a plan.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:00.910
It's being unveiled
now by Robert Mueller.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.340
I'm beginning to be familiar
with how investigations work,

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.650
and this one is working.

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:09.650
September is going
to be a storm.

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.900
The big question for us--

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:14.700
let's hope so.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:18.540
But even if Democrats have a
majority of the votes, the way

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.307
the system is rigged and
the electoral college

00:30:22.307 --> 00:30:24.390
means that they may have
the majority of the votes

00:30:24.390 --> 00:30:27.060
and still not take the House.

00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.940
They have to get
above 56% majority.

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:34.720
So why are we not challenging
these old electoral college

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.650
rules?

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.780
Why are we not--

00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.660
why do we allow a
Congress to try 35 times

00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:44.440
to abolish Obamacare when
the public overwhelmingly

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.330
is in support of Obamacare?

00:30:46.330 --> 00:30:47.620
How do these things happen?

00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:49.480
In the dark.

00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.970
It's because we have
inherited a democracy,

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:55.640
but we're not working
to strengthen it.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:58.490
I think that we're
sitting here at Google,

00:30:58.490 --> 00:31:02.050
so obviously, we're talking
about the digital space.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.210
That's where the
power struggle will

00:31:04.210 --> 00:31:07.362
happen, one way or another.

00:31:07.362 --> 00:31:09.320
And they're playing the
game on the other side,

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:15.370
and not just with cyber attacks
and disruptive messaging,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:19.120
and what both sides
called fake news.

00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.160
When both sides call
everything fake news,

00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:22.900
we get confused, right?

00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:25.600
What's the good
source of information?

00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.880
And how easily are our
media bought by advertisers?

00:31:35.505 --> 00:31:37.880
I write for some of these, so
I don't want to knock them.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.588
But you open "Time"
magazine, and there's

00:31:39.588 --> 00:31:42.870
an advertisement for Boeing.

00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:46.530
Now I don't have enough
money to buy a Boeing plane,

00:31:46.530 --> 00:31:49.820
so I'm like, what's this
advertising doing there?

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:51.560
It's a place holder
in case there's

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.910
a story they don't like.

00:31:52.910 --> 00:31:54.550
They withdraw the advertising.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:56.480
The editor jumps.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:32:01.520
And yeah, our
freedom and our press

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:07.220
will live or die together,
was the big quote by Pulitzer,

00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.080
or at least something like it.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.020
I think we're facing this
kind of situation right now.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:16.285
And in the digital space is
where the battle will play out.

00:32:16.285 --> 00:32:17.660
KEITH WRIGHT: So
you're basically

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:22.640
saying that corruption is
fought through democracy.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.765
Strengthening democracy.

00:32:23.765 --> 00:32:24.080
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.496
KEITH WRIGHT:
Upholding, you know,

00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:29.394
the principles of a
democratic nation?

00:32:29.394 --> 00:32:30.310
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:32:30.310 --> 00:32:31.430
And fighting for them.

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:32.221
KEITH WRIGHT: Yeah.

00:32:32.221 --> 00:32:35.570
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: I
mean, we have values.

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:36.670
They mean something.

00:32:36.670 --> 00:32:37.750
They're not just words.

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:41.480
KEITH WRIGHT: Well, if America
is sort of like, the poster

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.900
child of democracy, a
democratic nation for the world,

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:49.010
like how do you think that--

00:32:49.010 --> 00:32:50.720
how resilient do
you think our system

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:55.277
is today in the face of some
of these new challenges?

00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:57.860
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: I just listened
to the former head of the CIA

00:32:57.860 --> 00:32:59.300
give an interview
in which he said

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.450
he was frightened to death.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:06.450
So I'm not in a position
to disagree with that.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:12.180
The system would be resilient
if the year was 1950.

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.650
And even then,
there were issues.

00:33:13.650 --> 00:33:15.630
The military industrial
complex, et cetera,

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:18.450
they had too much power.

00:33:18.450 --> 00:33:21.000
Eisenhower tried to
warn us about it.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.890
But there's always
going to be clusters

00:33:22.890 --> 00:33:24.610
of power in a given society.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:27.000
And there are always going
to be efforts to lobby.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.680
The question is, what laws
do we have in place, and our

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:33.120
we enforcing these laws?

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:36.030
We have anti-corruption
laws that, if enforced,

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:40.380
would stop half of US trade
with some of these most

00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.940
corrupt countries.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.580
So it's selective enforcement.

00:33:45.580 --> 00:33:49.400
It's selective awareness.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.856
We have a public that
knows how to organize

00:33:51.856 --> 00:33:55.490
a protest, like
Occupy Wall Street,

00:33:55.490 --> 00:34:01.280
but does not know how to make
demands or vote in a way that--

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:06.440
we can learn a little bit from
the 1968 generation, I think,

00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.500
when it comes to
rocking the boat.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.460
Because I'll predict right now
that this is a boat, that if we

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:18.034
don't rock it, it's not
going in the right direction.

00:34:18.034 --> 00:34:19.909
KEITH WRIGHT: So talk
about rocking the boat,

00:34:19.909 --> 00:34:22.741
going back to the whole
whistleblowing story--

00:34:22.741 --> 00:34:24.199
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Well, I was young,

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:26.960
and I didn't understand the
repercussions of pissing off

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:29.120
the KGB and the CIA at the same.

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:33.440
And I was also lucky
because they didn't know

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:36.989
where to peg me, in a sense.

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:40.130
I was told by a person in
the know later on that I was,

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:43.280
in fact, extremely lucky,
because the Russians thought

00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.400
I was a CIA plant, and the CIA
thought I was a French plant,

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.270
and nobody quite
knew where to put me.

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:54.530
KEITH WRIGHT: Well, you
sort of blew the whistle

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:59.120
before it became, I guess,
popular on a mainstream level

00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.130
with Edward Snowden, right?

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:03.720
Edward Snowden happened
in, I think, 2013.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:05.657
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:35:05.657 --> 00:35:07.580
Bad things happen
to whistleblowers.

00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.441
I had made a
transition to writing.

00:35:09.441 --> 00:35:10.190
KEITH WRIGHT: Yeah

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:11.940
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: I'm
sitting in Hollywood,

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:14.810
writing screenplays, because
that's one of the best ways

00:35:14.810 --> 00:35:18.106
to communicate stories about
our true life, right now,

00:35:18.106 --> 00:35:20.480
is through drama apparently,
because people have given up

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.100
on the news.

00:35:22.100 --> 00:35:24.260
KEITH WRIGHT: Well,
we've had this upswing

00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:25.314
in whistleblowing, right?

00:35:25.314 --> 00:35:26.730
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Yeah, so that's--

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:27.570
KEITH WRIGHT: We had it
kicked off with Snowden,

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:28.730
and we also had--

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:31.597
I think his name's Christopher
Wiley from Cambridge Analytica,

00:35:31.597 --> 00:35:32.180
which really--

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:33.096
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:35:33.096 --> 00:35:36.860
And some girl [INAUDIBLE]
was called Faith Justice,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:38.480
or something like that?

00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:39.962
Always funny names.

00:35:39.962 --> 00:35:41.420
KEITH WRIGHT: So
my question to you

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.000
is, there might be many
other people out there

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.767
in a tough position, where
they have certain very

00:35:48.767 --> 00:35:51.350
valuable information that they
think that the public should be

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:55.830
aware of, and if they were
to disclose that information,

00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:58.340
it could sort of rock
the boat, but possibly

00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.820
in the favor of democracy,
is what they might be hoping.

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:03.404
So do you have any
advice to them?

00:36:03.404 --> 00:36:04.820
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
I do, because I'm

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.910
forced to give it all the time.

00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:08.210
They'll get in touch with me.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:09.918
They read the book,
or they see the film,

00:36:09.918 --> 00:36:14.300
and they want to figure out
how they can do something.

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:18.050
You know, the old saying
is, when you see something,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:19.150
do something.

00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:21.150
But we all know that
that's not always possible.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:22.760
You've got to pick
your battles in life,

00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.843
and you've got to survive.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:32.210
And now, I'm with two
children in Hollywood.

00:36:32.210 --> 00:36:34.020
Do I see corrupt practices?

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:34.520
Yeah.

00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:35.853
But like, am I rocking the boat?

00:36:35.853 --> 00:36:38.210
No, I'm trying to make
a new career, right?

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:40.250
So we all have times
in life when we were--

00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:42.291
KEITH WRIGHT: You're trying
to make a new career?

00:36:42.291 --> 00:36:44.140
Because you sort
of had to abandon--

00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:46.560
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Well,
diplomacy is out for me, yeah.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:46.940
KEITH WRIGHT: Right.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.315
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: But the big
job of a diplomat, they say,

00:36:49.315 --> 00:36:51.542
is to go abroad and lie
on behalf of your country.

00:36:51.542 --> 00:36:53.750
But the real biggest job of
a diplomat is to shut up.

00:36:53.750 --> 00:36:56.000
KEITH WRIGHT: Well, it seems
like these whistleblowers

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.777
are sort of left in
these dire situations.

00:36:57.777 --> 00:36:59.360
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
They send me e-mails.

00:36:59.360 --> 00:37:00.260
They send me e-mails.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.070
I send them over
to my ProtonMail,

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:08.150
and then I ask them to explain
what it is they've got,

00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:10.460
and who--

00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.100
you know, it's a
question of strategizing.

00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:15.500
You don't need to put your
own career on the line

00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.290
to get information out.

00:37:18.290 --> 00:37:21.530
You can work from the inside
there are sometimes-- you know,

00:37:21.530 --> 00:37:23.230
there have been reforms.

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:25.520
And the UN invited me
back to brief them about,

00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.360
how do we treat--

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.600
the whistleblowers are usually
some of the top performing

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:30.290
staff.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:34.850
They're not just some person
sitting at a desk somewhere.

00:37:34.850 --> 00:37:37.550
So how can we use these
whistleblowers to actually

00:37:37.550 --> 00:37:38.810
improve our management?

00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:39.540
OK.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.330
And you're like,
is this blah, blah?

00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:44.090
Or is this-- you know, it's
still a risk to speak up,

00:37:44.090 --> 00:37:46.100
and we all know it.

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.740
The question is when to
speak up for maximum effect

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.480
and how to play the politics.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.230
The op ed was in "The
Wall Street Journal"

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:55.605
because "The Wall
Street Journal"

00:37:55.605 --> 00:37:57.320
wanted an anti-UN in peace.

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.667
My book came out through
Nation books from the left,

00:37:59.667 --> 00:38:01.250
because I didn't
want to be identified

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:03.500
with this sort of war on the EU.

00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.850
I was a journalist by training.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.490
I was able to play that game.

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:09.980
You can leak
information, but you

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:16.340
need to create a trustworthy
relationship with a journalist

00:38:16.340 --> 00:38:17.540
that has a track record.

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.294
Now, one person tried this.

00:38:19.294 --> 00:38:20.210
It was Edward Snowden.

00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:21.751
I don't know if some
of you have seen

00:38:21.751 --> 00:38:24.290
the documentary of him
meeting these guys in a hotel

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.850
room in Hong Kong?

00:38:26.850 --> 00:38:33.270
He was the quintessential
sacrificial Christ-like

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:33.960
whistleblower.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:38.340
He knew his life was
over, that if he merely

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:43.980
survived giving his warning--

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:47.610
and his warning to us,
by the way, was serious.

00:38:47.610 --> 00:38:54.810
He warned us that the
systems were in place,

00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:57.750
so that if a wrong
government came to power

00:38:57.750 --> 00:39:03.420
and just assigned certain
tasks to cyber command,

00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:06.825
we would be facing something
he called turnkey tyranny.

00:39:09.630 --> 00:39:12.720
And we're just going about
our business, turnkey tyranny,

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:14.520
yeah.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.900
We have to be a little careful.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:17.250
We have to think.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.057
We have to read through the
lines when we read the news.

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:21.390
And we have to choose our cause.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:23.940
We can all fight every cause.

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:27.840
But I think people that
are inside government

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:30.060
is the most important.

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.090
Because if you're in a
corporation and something

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.140
is wrong, it's also business.

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:36.210
You can move on with your life.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:38.160
You can do other things.

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:39.870
My biggest advice
to whistleblowers,

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.080
and they come to me a lot, is
to first protect themselves.

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.800
Have a plan, because if
you're sacrificing yourselves,

00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.800
you're not helping the
fight against corruption.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.080
You're just committing suicide.

00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.130
And unfortunately,
if that worked,

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:56.220
I would be like, OK, go ahead.

00:39:56.220 --> 00:39:58.710
But it doesn't.

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:01.170
And what really works
is to rock the boat.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:05.310
What really works to electrify
bureaucrats into action

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:13.860
and shine light on certain
aspects of how our world works.

00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.860
Because when some
things come to light,

00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.070
suddenly they become scandals.

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:22.260
And when things become
scandals, bureaucrats

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.320
have to figure out, well,
how do I keep my seat?

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.030
I'll be on this side of the
investigation, or I'll be--

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:30.900
there's a political
logic to all of it.

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:34.530
But if we're not able to use
the tools at our disposal

00:40:34.530 --> 00:40:38.080
to shine light on some of
the greatest inequities

00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:41.160
and acts of corruption
in the world,

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:46.260
then we're simply not
using our medium correctly.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.650
They have a purpose other
than to entertain us.

00:40:49.650 --> 00:40:52.110
And it is, in fact, very
entertaining to see bureaucrats

00:40:52.110 --> 00:40:52.920
electrified.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:53.760
I promise you.

00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:57.450
It's actually
quite entertaining.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:02.970
Because seeing people
having to defend

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:05.190
the indefensible is comedic.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.190
Try interviewing a BP
official while there's

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:14.250
a gusher in the
Caribbean and say,

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:15.750
we have the situation
under control.

00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:18.360
And on the other split screen,
they're like [MAKING NOISES]

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:19.440
It's funny.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.390
And it makes for
good news, and we

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.014
have to understand what
the news people want.

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:25.680
We have to play their
game, because they

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.690
have our attention.

00:41:28.690 --> 00:41:31.920
And so I think good
whistleblowing, in general,

00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.310
means getting the right kind
of attention on an issue.

00:41:35.310 --> 00:41:40.650
Figure out where the story is,
why that story is entertaining.

00:41:40.650 --> 00:41:46.650
Because we have ADD as a
people, as a generation.

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:50.460
And if we're not
entertained, we don't care.

00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:57.094
KEITH WRIGHT: So you say
use tools at your disposal.

00:41:57.094 --> 00:41:58.010
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:41:58.010 --> 00:41:59.460
KEITH WRIGHT: If you look at
a lot of those tools today--

00:41:59.460 --> 00:41:59.670
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:01.360
And entertainment is
a big one of them.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.567
I mean, entertainment
got Trump the Presidency.

00:42:05.567 --> 00:42:06.525
Entertainment is power.

00:42:06.525 --> 00:42:08.233
KEITH WRIGHT: Well,
a lot of these tools,

00:42:08.233 --> 00:42:11.770
they're sort of born or
developed in the digital space.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:12.270
Right?

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:13.084
In here--

00:42:13.084 --> 00:42:14.000
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Yeah.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.380
KEITH WRIGHT: --they are
conducting a Google Talk.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:18.636
Many of the people
in the audience

00:42:18.636 --> 00:42:20.010
are working in
the digital space.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:21.990
I'm curious to know,
do you have any sort

00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:25.530
of advice for people working
in the digital space?

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.657
Is it sort of good
news, bad news?

00:42:27.657 --> 00:42:29.990
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: No, I think
there's opportunities here.

00:42:29.990 --> 00:42:31.590
I've seen-- really.

00:42:31.590 --> 00:42:35.460
I've seen cases of
employee activism

00:42:35.460 --> 00:42:39.420
that have made enormous changes
in the decisions of higher

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:43.770
ups in the corporate structure.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.840
The problem of the
corporation per se

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.340
is that it always looks for
profit and satisfying board

00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.300
members.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.010
But now we've talk
about corporate social

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:54.330
responsibility.

00:42:54.330 --> 00:42:56.850
Are we paying lip service
to it, or are there

00:42:56.850 --> 00:43:00.000
are certain values that are a
little bit more crystal clear

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.210
than that, and who is in
charge of identifying them

00:43:03.210 --> 00:43:04.930
and of defending them.

00:43:04.930 --> 00:43:07.350
There's always a gap
somewhere in the loop,

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.890
because money talks.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:13.530
The only thing that
can stand up to money

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:17.880
is humor and entertainment.

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.430
We've got now late
night shows that people

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:23.350
watch more than they
watch the nightly news.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.350
That says something about
where our society is.

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:28.930
We don't get our news
from World News Tonight.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:32.140
We get it from the guys
making fun of what's going on,

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:34.750
because we're actually
learning something.

00:43:34.750 --> 00:43:36.550
And they're unafraid,
and they're unafraid

00:43:36.550 --> 00:43:38.500
because they get laughs.

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:45.470
Entertainment and, of
course, mobilizing and so on,

00:43:45.470 --> 00:43:48.130
we're in a state of
flux here, because we

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:51.220
don't know whether the digital
age will be the end of us,

00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:54.130
because the logarithms that
say, this is your past,

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:56.680
and this will be your
future, will kind of command

00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:59.920
and control our actions
and limit our freedom,

00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.570
or whether we will be
empowered in the digital space

00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:08.080
to be individuals,
to be organized,

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:09.790
and hopefully to
not be infiltrated.

00:44:09.790 --> 00:44:12.430
When people start a movement
like Black Lives Matter,

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:14.770
they don't want Russian
agents going in and messing up

00:44:14.770 --> 00:44:15.992
their messaging.

00:44:15.992 --> 00:44:18.200
And that's what's coming
out from this investigation.

00:44:18.200 --> 00:44:22.570
So we live in incredibly
interesting times right now.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:26.590
I just happen to have dipped
in the corruption soup a bit

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:30.510
early, but it took me a
while to think about it,

00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:34.000
and what it means, and
why it's important.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.370
And I'm sitting before you
today, dead frightened.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:40.440
KEITH WRIGHT: I think
that's a great note

00:44:40.440 --> 00:44:44.115
to end on, and open it
up to audience questions.

00:44:44.115 --> 00:44:45.240
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: I'm sorry.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:45.980
I don't mean to scare you.

00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.890
KEITH WRIGHT: I don't know
if anybody has any questions,

00:44:46.890 --> 00:44:49.181
but if you do, you can go
ahead and step up to the mic.

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:56.150
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot
for taking the time.

00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:59.000
I just read Bill Browder's
book, "Red Notice,"

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.810
about the guy who came up in
the Trump-Putin summit that

00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.000
lobbied for
sanctions [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.620
to sanction the
individuals that were

00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:10.070
responsible for his lawyer's
death in prison in Russia.

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:14.000
I'm just curious what you think
about this law as an approach,

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.820
the idea of sanctioning people
associated with an oligarch

00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:20.435
or a dictator as a
disincentive for corruption.

00:45:20.435 --> 00:45:22.310
Do you think this is an
effective tactic that

00:45:22.310 --> 00:45:24.560
should be more adopted
throughout the EU

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.280
and other countries, or
is it more of a symbol?

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.530
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Targeted sanctions

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:34.190
can be effective,
because they attack

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.370
the people around a dictator.

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:42.580
These are his support
systems, his people.

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:47.660
And why do you think Putin
wanted Hillary to lose so bad?

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.040
It was effective.

00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:52.060
Yeah.

00:45:52.060 --> 00:45:54.640
You know, we have to
be careful with when

00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:57.010
applying any type of sanctions.

00:45:57.010 --> 00:46:00.400
We have to not apply
sanctions that that

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.920
harm entire populations.

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:05.590
There's really never
much gain from there.

00:46:05.590 --> 00:46:08.650
We have to apply sanctions
that target leaders.

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:12.730
Because corruptions is like, the
fish rots from the head, right?

00:46:12.730 --> 00:46:15.340
Without democracy, there would
be no talk of corruption.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:18.335
If the King is the King and
has all the power, what he does

00:46:18.335 --> 00:46:18.960
is not corrupt.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.600
It's legal.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.990
And we have to also see the
distinction between legality

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.820
and moral corruption.

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:32.850
Somehow, this country
thought that slavery was not

00:46:32.850 --> 00:46:35.730
only legal, but moral
based on the Bible,

00:46:35.730 --> 00:46:42.240
and some like, real mind-bending
sort of arguments at the time,

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.180
not so long ago.

00:46:45.180 --> 00:46:48.330
And some people spoke up.

00:46:48.330 --> 00:46:51.450
The biggest
bestseller in America

00:46:51.450 --> 00:46:54.480
was called "Uncle Tom's Cabin."

00:46:54.480 --> 00:47:00.940
The media can change
the path of a nation.

00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:05.250
Lincoln credited Harriet
Beecher Stowe and other people

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:11.770
with changing the public's
mind about the biggest

00:47:11.770 --> 00:47:14.890
issue of the day.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:21.100
But democracy does not
advance without a fight.

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:25.300
On the beaches of
Normandy, my dad

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.860
took me there when I was young.

00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.430
He was a journalist.

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.930
And I didn't know
what he was doing.

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:31.600
And he just took
me there and showed

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:36.461
me all the tombstones of the
people who had died that day.

00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:38.710
And he just said-- and I'm
nine years old and he said,

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:41.060
this is why you're free.

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.080
Wow, well, I don't want
to be dead, but OK.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:47.650
You know, but it's a fight.

00:47:47.650 --> 00:47:49.450
It's a fight, and
together we're stronger.

00:47:49.450 --> 00:47:53.330
So the individual
whistleblower like Snowden,

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:57.670
it pains me to see that, of all
places, he's stuck in Russia.

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:59.110
You know?

00:47:59.110 --> 00:48:01.780
In an odd twist of fate.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:07.930
But if he had
stayed in Hong Kong,

00:48:07.930 --> 00:48:10.510
he would have turned up
dead in a garage somewhere.

00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:12.620
It's quite clear.

00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.410
But laws like
this, yeah, they've

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.660
lobbied hard to try to lift it.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:20.380
And they hate the
people that imposed it.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:24.850
And no, I think if
there's no consequences--

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:28.690
but that's us trying to
teach a dictatorship how

00:48:28.690 --> 00:48:30.490
to be less corrupt.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:32.620
We're only going to be
that successful at that.

00:48:32.620 --> 00:48:35.720
We have to look
inside a little bit.

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:41.150
We have to look at how much of
an example are we to the world?

00:48:41.150 --> 00:48:44.270
Because people look at us,
and during the Arab Spring,

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:46.490
how did the Arab Spring start?

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:49.070
As a movement
against corruption.

00:48:49.070 --> 00:48:53.557
Some poor man's-- he was
a fruit/vegetable salesman

00:48:53.557 --> 00:48:54.140
in the street.

00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.290
His cart was turned over,
and he didn't pay his dues.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:59.240
And the whole
country went aflame

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.120
because they thought
this was so unfair.

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:07.200
And the entire Arab Spring
was about corruption.

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.800
But since they had seen
us being in cahoots

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.930
with their former
leaders, and not

00:49:12.930 --> 00:49:16.200
be sure about who we support
in each one of these conflicts,

00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:18.810
then the young people are
attracted to the extremists

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:19.920
that tell them--

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:22.454
the first thing they do
when they come into a town

00:49:22.454 --> 00:49:24.120
is they say, what are
the problems here?

00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:25.710
Boom, boom, boom, you die.

00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:29.490
They seem like our
version of your fired.

00:49:29.490 --> 00:49:30.150
Right?

00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:33.180
Somebody who's going to come
in, and get order, and restore

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:37.360
order and, restore
some sense of justice.

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:41.130
And that dynamic is very
important to understand.

00:49:41.130 --> 00:49:42.270
People want justice.

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:48.510
People want a system
that is just, that works.

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:50.520
So we can lecture
other countries,

00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:51.990
or we can sanction
other countries.

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:55.050
But we got to look first and
foremost at our own processes.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:57.540
That's where we're going to
make the biggest difference,

00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.880
and that's where we'll set
the example that others

00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:05.540
will eventually copy when they
get in a position to do so.

00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:07.580
When they overthrow
their regimes,

00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:08.956
they've got
somewhere to look to.

00:50:08.956 --> 00:50:11.371
Last time they overthrew their
regimes, they looked to us.

00:50:11.371 --> 00:50:12.750
They were like, they don't care.

00:50:12.750 --> 00:50:13.100
OK.

00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:14.600
Let's figure it out
among ourselves.

00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.950
And it was civil war.

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:22.230
So I think, yeah, I think that
smart, targeted sanctions are

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:24.750
a good means to
attack the problem,

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:30.890
but we've got to look at
our own mechanism first.

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:31.810
There's a lot of work.

00:50:34.114 --> 00:50:36.030
KEITH WRIGHT: Do you
have any other questions?

00:50:42.918 --> 00:50:44.590
AUDIENCE: So it
seems like you're

00:50:44.590 --> 00:50:48.770
advocating for media as a way
to sort of fight these problems,

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:52.030
but it's also become clear
that like, media and telling

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:53.750
stories works on both sides.

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.030
And there's propaganda
on both sides.

00:50:56.030 --> 00:51:00.310
So what are your thoughts
on this, and how we can make

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:02.745
sure that the
stories that we tell

00:51:02.745 --> 00:51:04.120
and the stories
that are told are

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:05.536
things that are
actually accurate,

00:51:05.536 --> 00:51:07.036
and it will actually
help the world?

00:51:07.036 --> 00:51:09.202
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Well, this
is a very good question,

00:51:09.202 --> 00:51:10.780
because we're not
only participating

00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:14.120
in telling stories, we're
also story consumers.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.940
So when we click on
click bait that's

00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:20.740
like somewhere between
an ad and a slide show,

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.170
we are participating
in the telling of news

00:51:23.170 --> 00:51:25.990
that is going to be, at
some level, manipulative.

00:51:25.990 --> 00:51:28.730
Even if it's just
to sell a shampoo,

00:51:28.730 --> 00:51:30.430
it's still going
to manipulate us.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:32.890
If we seek out
sources of news that

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:37.042
are what I would call
hard news, then yeah,

00:51:37.042 --> 00:51:38.500
we're going to get
the information,

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:41.870
but we won't be as entertained.

00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:45.490
We can entertain ourselves and
click ourselves into tyranny.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:47.750
There is no guarantee that
at the end of this century,

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:51.120
we're going to be living in
what we call today a democracy.

00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:57.030
If we click the wrong
buttons, it has consequences.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.550
Now, it's a game.

00:51:59.550 --> 00:52:04.830
To prevail, the greater values
have to be more entertaining.

00:52:04.830 --> 00:52:08.670
The stories have to be more
entertaining, more engaging,

00:52:08.670 --> 00:52:09.920
than the other side's stories.

00:52:13.150 --> 00:52:16.321
And I think that's where
I pitch the battle.

00:52:16.321 --> 00:52:19.620
KEITH WRIGHT: So I think we
have time for one more question.

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.010
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks
again for taking the time.

00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:26.020
Just curious how you're thinking
about your own personal safety

00:52:26.020 --> 00:52:27.820
and security?

00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:30.480
Now, obviously,
Saddam Hussein himself

00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:31.570
is obviously not a threat.

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:35.380
But there's still
a lot of people

00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:38.170
who are associated with many
of the people who were involved

00:52:38.170 --> 00:52:40.037
with the case that
you whistleblew on,

00:52:40.037 --> 00:52:42.370
who were still out there,
that there's a lot of interest

00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:45.730
just in the general, you
know, exposure to things

00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.530
that could be [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:49.100
Aren't you concerned about your
own-- like when you travel?

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:50.475
MICHAEL SOUSSAN:
Well, there were

00:52:50.475 --> 00:52:51.970
times that were more dangerous.

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:57.730
But once things come to
light, the danger is on them.

00:52:57.730 --> 00:53:01.920
And the truth is, once the
light shines on the problem,

00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:05.430
they invite you back to give a
talk at their corporate retreat

00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:07.830
to their ethics group
that they just set up

00:53:07.830 --> 00:53:11.670
after they paid a huge fine
of, you know, $30 million

00:53:11.670 --> 00:53:14.130
to the US government, none
of which went back to Iraq,

00:53:14.130 --> 00:53:15.850
by the way.

00:53:15.850 --> 00:53:19.650
But no, you can
change the dynamic.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.205
Shedding light does
change dynamics.

00:53:24.810 --> 00:53:28.560
People who know that they
are part of a system that

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:34.620
is doing something wrong
are afraid of the truth

00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.960
and of transparency.

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:43.380
And when it is occurring,
they switch sides.

00:53:43.380 --> 00:53:47.300
And just like a normal
person would do,

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.785
you play with the winning team.

00:53:52.110 --> 00:53:53.930
I was shit scared at
some point in my life,

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:58.797
but I had to PTSD
my way out of that.

00:53:58.797 --> 00:54:00.380
KEITH WRIGHT: Well,
I think with that,

00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:01.504
we'll go ahead and wrap up.

00:54:01.504 --> 00:54:03.470
But thank you, Michael,
so much for coming.

00:54:03.470 --> 00:54:04.470
MICHAEL SOUSSAN: Thanks.

00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:05.370
KEITH WRIGHT: We appreciate it.

00:54:05.370 --> 00:54:06.828
It's a powerful
message [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:06.828 --> 00:54:08.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:11.400
Thank you, everybody.
