very pleased to be leading you I'm not
sure where I'm leading you hopefully not

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:05.169

astray here are the impalas having a

00:07:09.029 --> 00:07:09.039
astray here are the impalas having a
 

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:11.430
astray here are the impalas having a
drink now interestingly of course we

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440
drink now interestingly of course we
 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.920
drink now interestingly of course we
have a dam here which is of course

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930
have a dam here which is of course
 

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.409
have a dam here which is of course
supposed to store water and while it

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419
supposed to store water and while it
 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:17.730
supposed to store water and while it
looks like this quite a lot of water

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:17.740
looks like this quite a lot of water
 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:21.029
looks like this quite a lot of water
here it really hasn't filled up to the

00:07:21.029 --> 00:07:21.039
here it really hasn't filled up to the
 

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.469
here it really hasn't filled up to the
extent that it might have and that's

00:07:22.469 --> 00:07:22.479
extent that it might have and that's
 

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.029
extent that it might have and that's
because we've had a lower than average

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039
because we've had a lower than average
 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.060
because we've had a lower than average
rainfall as has been norm for the last

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070
rainfall as has been norm for the last
 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.409
rainfall as has been norm for the last
three or four years now and so I suspect

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:31.419
three or four years now and so I suspect
 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.270
three or four years now and so I suspect
that we're probably going to have

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280
that we're probably going to have
 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.460
that we're probably going to have
another fairly difficult dry season

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:35.470
another fairly difficult dry season
 

00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:37.200
another fairly difficult dry season

comes September and October this year

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.370

you'll be able to kind of pick up things
 

00:34:14.409 --> 00:34:17.070
you'll be able to kind of pick up things
that you might not have picked up in a

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.080
that you might not have picked up in a
 

00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.330
that you might not have picked up in a
noisier vehicle so that's one aspect of

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:21.340
noisier vehicle so that's one aspect of
 

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.790
noisier vehicle so that's one aspect of
it the other aspect i mean from a from a

electric vehicles at wilder's it's it's

00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:27.730
electric vehicles at wilder's it's it's
 

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.280
electric vehicles at wilder's it's it's
much better as there's almost no

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:29.290
much better as there's almost no
 

00:34:29.290 --> 00:34:31.830
much better as there's almost no
vibration when the vehicle starts and

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:31.840
vibration when the vehicle starts and
 

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.010
vibration when the vehicle starts and
moves around and so for the cat mops it

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:35.020
moves around and so for the cat mops it
 

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:37.260
moves around and so for the cat mops it
would be a lot easier or so much quiet

00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:37.270
would be a lot easier or so much quiet
 

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.090
would be a lot easier or so much quiet
so when we would be driving around and

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:39.100
so when we would be driving around and

from that point of view be really nice
obviously it's meant to be a cleaner

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:51.520
obviously it's meant to be a cleaner
 

00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.700
obviously it's meant to be a cleaner

I just still wonder what the longevity

00:34:59.940 --> 00:34:59.950
I just still wonder what the longevity
 

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:02.930
I just still wonder what the longevity
of those vehicles are what happens to

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940
of those vehicles are what happens to

and we're so the reaction of animals I
mean we've obviously been seeing a few

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:13.570
mean we've obviously been seeing a few
 

00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:16.170

kind of electric vehicles in our area

00:35:16.170 --> 00:35:16.180
kind of electric vehicles in our area

to go everywhere where he tried to take

to go everywhere where he tried to take
it so that's good news and the range on

00:37:33.839 --> 00:37:33.849
it so that's good news and the range on
 

00:37:33.849 --> 00:37:36.210
it so that's good news and the range on
those particular ones that he tried is

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:36.220
those particular ones that he tried is
 

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.539
those particular ones that he tried is
about 200 kilometers which is a big

00:37:39.539 --> 00:37:39.549
about 200 kilometers which is a big
 

00:37:39.549 --> 00:37:41.309
about 200 kilometers which is a big
range that they have before it needs

charging and the amounts of charging
 

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:44.789
charging and the amounts of charging
that needs to take place is obviously

00:37:44.789 --> 00:37:44.799
that needs to take place is obviously
 

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:46.920
that needs to take place is obviously
dependent on how much you use

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:46.930
dependent on how much you use
 

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:49.140

there's no other reason for them to be
together but look at the relationship

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:24.730
together but look at the relationship
 

00:48:24.730 --> 00:48:26.880
together but look at the relationship
between the Mongoose and hornbills and

publish and I think that's could be one
 

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:30.010

of them and there's one major difference

00:49:30.010 --> 00:49:30.020
of them and there's one major difference
 

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:33.200
of them and there's one major difference
between males and females now when they

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:33.210
between males and females now when they
 

00:49:33.210 --> 00:49:35.120

reason why these birds

00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880
reason why these birds
 

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:50.120
reason why these birds
gets in quite vulnerable is because they

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:50.130
gets in quite vulnerable is because they
 

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:52.760
gets in quite vulnerable is because they
take so long to mature so it takes about

00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:52.770
take so long to mature so it takes about
 

00:49:52.770 --> 00:49:55.970
take so long to mature so it takes about
three years for the youngsters to be

00:49:55.970 --> 00:49:55.980
three years for the youngsters to be
 

00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:57.950
three years for the youngsters to be
thrown out of the group by the adults

00:49:57.950 --> 00:49:57.960
thrown out of the group by the adults
 

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:00.590
thrown out of the group by the adults
and for that reason if they keep losing

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:00.600
and for that reason if they keep losing
 

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:03.620
and for that reason if they keep losing
their habitat I'm talking of for them to

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:03.630
their habitat I'm talking of for them to
 

00:50:03.630 --> 00:50:06.170

so that's where they were I don't I have

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:16.960
so that's where they were I don't I have
 

01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:18.240

an update about either of them today but

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:20.710
an update about either of them today but
 

01:16:20.710 --> 01:16:22.290
an update about either of them today but
I would imagine that should do news with

01:16:22.290 --> 01:16:22.300
I would imagine that should do news with
 

01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:24.360
I would imagine that should do news with
the Cubs and still on earth users

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:24.370

inside of arethusa

01:16:27.390 --> 01:16:27.400
inside of arethusa
 

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.550
inside of arethusa
which means that she's not very close to

01:16:29.550 --> 01:16:29.560
which means that she's not very close to
 

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.470
which means that she's not very close to
our boundary and therefore doubtful that

01:16:31.470 --> 01:16:31.480
our boundary and therefore doubtful that
 

01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.209
our boundary and therefore doubtful that
she would have crossed onto our side

01:16:33.209 --> 01:16:33.219
she would have crossed onto our side
 

01:16:33.219 --> 01:16:35.310
she would have crossed onto our side

driving around we'll go and have a
little bit of a look but there really is

01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:39.910
little bit of a look but there really is
 

01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:42.240
little bit of a look but there really is
very little to go on at the moment we've

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:42.250

more than people think
it's just that's these two combinations

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:18.960
it's just that's these two combinations
 

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:21.380
it's just that's these two combinations
that work against us for seeing a lot of

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:21.390
that work against us for seeing a lot of
 

01:17:21.390 --> 01:17:23.660
that work against us for seeing a lot of
lipid in the mire a triangle one thing

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:23.670
lipid in the mire a triangle one thing
 

01:17:23.670 --> 01:17:26.300
lipid in the mire a triangle one thing
is that we obviously spend a lot of time

01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:26.310
is that we obviously spend a lot of time
 

01:17:26.310 --> 01:17:27.920
is that we obviously spend a lot of time
in a certain area given the certain

01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:27.930
in a certain area given the certain
 

01:17:27.930 --> 01:17:29.420
in a certain area given the certain
animals that we like to follow like

01:17:29.420 --> 01:17:29.430
animals that we like to follow like
 

01:17:29.430 --> 01:17:31.070
animals that we like to follow like
sausage tree prior to you know all of

01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080
sausage tree prior to you know all of
 

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.990
sausage tree prior to you know all of
those kind of things and that's not very

01:17:32.990 --> 01:17:33.000
those kind of things and that's not very
 

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.040
those kind of things and that's not very
lipid-rich

01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:34.050
lipid-rich
 

01:17:34.050 --> 01:17:35.720
lipid-rich
yeah because it's up towards the

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:35.730
yeah because it's up towards the
 

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:37.730
yeah because it's up towards the
escarpment and the open area things so

01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:37.740
escarpment and the open area things so
 

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.560
escarpment and the open area things so
we don't spend nearly as much time where

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:39.570
we don't spend nearly as much time where
 

01:17:39.570 --> 01:17:41.360
we don't spend nearly as much time where
a lot of the leopard sightings are the

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:41.370
a lot of the leopard sightings are the
 

01:17:41.370 --> 01:17:42.980
a lot of the leopard sightings are the
second reason why we don't spend a lot

01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:42.990
second reason why we don't spend a lot
 

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:44.450
second reason why we don't spend a lot
of time there and probably the major

01:17:44.450 --> 01:17:44.460
of time there and probably the major
 

01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.790
of time there and probably the major
reason is that most the lipids are seen

01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800
reason is that most the lipids are seen
 

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.210
reason is that most the lipids are seen
along the Mara River now south of Sirena

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:49.220
along the Mara River now south of Sirena
 

01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.620
along the Mara River now south of Sirena
and there's a little bit of a kind of

01:17:51.620 --> 01:17:51.630
and there's a little bit of a kind of
 

01:17:51.630 --> 01:17:53.660
and there's a little bit of a kind of
dip that goes down towards Lookout

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:53.670
dip that goes down towards Lookout
 

01:17:53.670 --> 01:17:56.060
dip that goes down towards Lookout
crossing and down to majima chavo and

01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:56.070
crossing and down to majima chavo and
 

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.060
crossing and down to majima chavo and
BBC drainage in those areas and we get

01:17:59.060 --> 01:17:59.070
BBC drainage in those areas and we get
 

01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:02.000
BBC drainage in those areas and we get
no signal there and so going and looking

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:02.010
no signal there and so going and looking
 

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.680
no signal there and so going and looking
for the lipids in that area is pretty

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:03.690
for the lipids in that area is pretty
 

01:18:03.690 --> 01:18:06.440
for the lipids in that area is pretty
useless unfortunately because we can't

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:06.450
useless unfortunately because we can't
 

01:18:06.450 --> 01:18:09.140
useless unfortunately because we can't
really show you them and so that's why

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:09.150
really show you them and so that's why
 

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:10.550
really show you them and so that's why
the number of lipid sightings in the

01:18:10.550 --> 01:18:10.560
the number of lipid sightings in the
 

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:13.490
the number of lipid sightings in the
mara for us is so so low it's just

01:18:13.490 --> 01:18:13.500
mara for us is so so low it's just
 

01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.190
mara for us is so so low it's just
because we can't spend times in time in

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:16.200
because we can't spend times in time in
 

01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.590
because we can't spend times in time in
the areas where it's most productive for

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600
the areas where it's most productive for
 

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:22.070
the areas where it's most productive for
the lipids so yeah I'm happy that she

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080
the lipids so yeah I'm happy that she
 

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.270
the lipids so yeah I'm happy that she
got to see them I'm really glad that we

01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280
got to see them I'm really glad that we
 

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.670
got to see them I'm really glad that we
got both of them one on camera so it's

01:18:25.670 --> 01:18:25.680
got both of them one on camera so it's
 

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.710
got both of them one on camera so it's
it's a female that's is believed to be

01:18:27.710 --> 01:18:27.720
it's a female that's is believed to be
 

01:18:27.720 --> 01:18:29.930
it's a female that's is believed to be
about 10 11 years old I'll give you some

01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940
about 10 11 years old I'll give you some
 

01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.130
about 10 11 years old I'll give you some
history of this because I spoke to yeah

01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140
history of this because I spoke to yeah
 

01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:33.110
history of this because I spoke to yeah
funny and I spoke to Adam randomly today

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:33.120
funny and I spoke to Adam randomly today
 

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:35.480
funny and I spoke to Adam randomly today
and then he was telling me about this

01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:35.490
and then he was telling me about this
 

01:18:35.490 --> 01:18:37.250
and then he was telling me about this
but she's about a 10 11 year-old female

01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:37.260
but she's about a 10 11 year-old female
 

01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:39.830
but she's about a 10 11 year-old female
and that's a young male that she's she's

01:18:39.830 --> 01:18:39.840
and that's a young male that she's she's
 

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.600
and that's a young male that she's she's
got at the moment he's about 16 months

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:41.610
got at the moment he's about 16 months
 

01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:44.540
got at the moment he's about 16 months
old they think and they know of three

01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:44.550
old they think and they know of three
 

01:18:44.550 --> 01:18:48.710
old they think and they know of three
previous litters to this one and they

01:18:48.710 --> 01:18:48.720
previous litters to this one and they
 

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.540
previous litters to this one and they
one I think is a young male that's

01:18:50.540 --> 01:18:50.550
one I think is a young male that's
 

01:18:50.550 --> 01:18:52.580
one I think is a young male that's
hanging around the triangle stool and

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:52.590
hanging around the triangle stool and
 

01:18:52.590 --> 01:18:53.840
hanging around the triangle stool and
then the others they're not too sure

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:53.850
then the others they're not too sure
 

01:18:53.850 --> 01:18:55.700
then the others they're not too sure
about and they think that this bit of

01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:55.710
about and they think that this bit of
 

01:18:55.710 --> 01:18:56.990
about and they think that this bit of
this particular that say there was a

01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000
this particular that say there was a
 

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.060
this particular that say there was a
little mate but they can't confirm that

01:18:59.060 --> 01:18:59.070
little mate but they can't confirm that
 

01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:01.550
little mate but they can't confirm that
so she's seen quite a lot on the

01:19:01.550 --> 01:19:01.560
so she's seen quite a lot on the
 

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:04.910
so she's seen quite a lot on the
northern bank close to serena every now

01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:04.920
northern bank close to serena every now
 

01:19:04.920 --> 01:19:06.230
northern bank close to serena every now
and then she comes across onto that

01:19:06.230 --> 01:19:06.240
and then she comes across onto that
 

01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.460
and then she comes across onto that
Southern Bank I believe she made that

01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:07.470
Southern Bank I believe she made that
 

01:19:07.470 --> 01:19:09.370
Southern Bank I believe she made that
gazelle kill yesterday

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:09.380
gazelle kill yesterday
 

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:11.590
gazelle kill yesterday
and she was senior and then obviously

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600
and she was senior and then obviously
 

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.750
and she was senior and then obviously
again today which is very very cool so

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:13.760
again today which is very very cool so
 

01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.790
again today which is very very cool so
really nice that she was seen like I

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:15.800
really nice that she was seen like I
 

01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.230
really nice that she was seen like I

everybody gets to see the spotted cats
 

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:20.650
everybody gets to see the spotted cats
and what I am jealous all I think is

01:19:20.650 --> 01:19:20.660
and what I am jealous all I think is
 

01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:22.000
and what I am jealous all I think is
that the Mara has been absolutely

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:22.010
that the Mara has been absolutely
 

01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:24.400
that the Mara has been absolutely

it gives you an idea it's almost three

what we do and so it's probably why you

so if it's got a very straight into it

02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:40.010
so if it's got a very straight into it
 

02:13:40.010 --> 02:13:43.130
so if it's got a very straight into it
then it is a female if it's got a

02:13:43.130 --> 02:13:43.140
then it is a female if it's got a
 

02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:46.070
then it is a female if it's got a
triangular tip then it is a male so

02:13:46.070 --> 02:13:46.080
triangular tip then it is a male so
 

02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:47.300
triangular tip then it is a male so

frightened bird flew over or something
 

02:15:20.619 --> 02:15:22.290
frightened bird flew over or something
like that and that's why they went

02:15:22.290 --> 02:15:22.300
like that and that's why they went
 

02:15:22.300 --> 02:15:26.540
like that and that's why they went

02:15:30.210 --> 02:15:32.630
 
it also explains why the approach

02:15:32.630 --> 02:15:32.640
it also explains why the approach

ones will be from a different mom and so

02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:42.210
ones will be from a different mom and so
 

02:15:42.210 --> 02:15:46.210
ones will be from a different mom and so
they would not suckle from from ribbon

02:15:46.210 --> 02:15:46.220
they would not suckle from from ribbon
 

02:15:46.220 --> 02:15:50.660

should go and check it out just to see

02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:00.450
should go and check it out just to see
 

02:16:00.450 --> 02:16:02.450
should go and check it out just to see
and then come back yeah might be worth

02:16:02.450 --> 02:16:02.460
and then come back yeah might be worth
 

02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:08.480
and then come back yeah might be worth

obviously a juvenile and I'm just gonna

02:16:59.880 --> 02:16:59.890
obviously a juvenile and I'm just gonna

be quiet while you listen to pretty u

that's the cuckoo and it's calling the

02:17:17.910 --> 02:17:17.920
that's the cuckoo and it's calling the
 

02:17:17.920 --> 02:17:20.010
that's the cuckoo and it's calling the
Starling and super the grass moving

there it's calling the Starling down and

there it's calling the Starling down and
 

02:17:22.480 --> 02:17:25.470
there it's calling the Starling down and
the Starling we've watched it feed the

02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:25.480
the Starling we've watched it feed the
 

02:17:25.480 --> 02:17:26.850

it for a second until Craig sat there

02:17:28.590 --> 02:17:28.600
it for a second until Craig sat there

02:17:36.440 --> 02:17:39.850
 
and what's interesting is that I suspect

02:17:39.850 --> 02:17:39.860
and what's interesting is that I suspect
 

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:43.540
and what's interesting is that I suspect
that cooking must be about to leave now

02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:43.550
that cooking must be about to leave now

would have laid an egg inside the
 

02:17:55.010 --> 02:17:57.610
would have laid an egg inside the
virtual starlings nest and I suspect

02:17:57.610 --> 02:17:57.620
virtual starlings nest and I suspect
 

02:17:57.620 --> 02:17:59.470
virtual starlings nest and I suspect
it's in the dead tree just behind us and

02:17:59.470 --> 02:17:59.480
it's in the dead tree just behind us and
 

02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:04.840
it's in the dead tree just behind us and
then flown off and the nature of birds

then flown off and the nature of birds
 

02:18:04.850 --> 02:18:06.850
then flown off and the nature of birds
or most birds is such that they would

never have realized that they were
raising someone else's chicks so they

02:18:10.600 --> 02:18:10.610
raising someone else's chicks so they
 

02:18:10.610 --> 02:18:13.360
raising someone else's chicks so they
would have thought that that great

unattractive offspring now then they

02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:23.030
unattractive offspring now then they
 

02:18:23.030 --> 02:18:25.930
unattractive offspring now then they
will fly off to war they're all migrate

02:18:25.930 --> 02:18:25.940
will fly off to war they're all migrate
 

02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:27.669

02:39:08.450 --> 02:39:08.460
a good scratch and unfortunately I would
 

02:39:08.460 --> 02:39:10.310
a good scratch and unfortunately I would
imagine that this particular thing is

02:39:10.310 --> 02:39:10.320
imagine that this particular thing is
 

02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:13.070
imagine that this particular thing is
covered in fleas at the moment given how

02:39:13.070 --> 02:39:13.080

long it's been used for I mean it's been

02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:14.460
long it's been used for I mean it's been
 

02:39:14.460 --> 02:39:15.890
long it's been used for I mean it's been
a good two months that they've been here

02:39:15.890 --> 02:39:15.900

now what a month and a half should I say
that they've been around this area and

that they've been around this area and
 

02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:21.790
that they've been around this area and
and that means that they have

02:39:21.790 --> 02:39:21.800
and that means that they have
 

02:39:21.800 --> 02:39:24.200

accumulated quite a few little fees

02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:24.210
accumulated quite a few little fees
 

02:39:24.210 --> 02:39:26.630

there she is

02:45:58.639 --> 02:45:58.649
 
 

02:45:58.649 --> 02:46:02.999
 
so Minami why are female hyenas bigger

02:46:02.999 --> 02:46:03.009
so Minami why are female hyenas bigger
 

02:46:03.009 --> 02:46:06.449
so Minami why are female hyenas bigger
than males well generally due to the

02:46:06.449 --> 02:46:06.459
than males well generally due to the
 

02:46:06.459 --> 02:46:08.460
than males well generally due to the
fact that they are more dominant within

02:46:08.460 --> 02:46:08.470
fact that they are more dominant within
 

02:46:08.470 --> 02:46:11.010
fact that they are more dominant within
within the group remember that it's not

02:46:11.010 --> 02:46:11.020
within the group remember that it's not
 

02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:12.960
within the group remember that it's not
always the case that females are that

02:46:12.960 --> 02:46:12.970
always the case that females are that
 

02:46:12.970 --> 02:46:15.510
always the case that females are that
much larger than males it does happen

02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520
much larger than males it does happen
 

02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:17.789
much larger than males it does happen
but it can be in that males are of equal

02:46:17.789 --> 02:46:17.799
but it can be in that males are of equal
 

02:46:17.799 --> 02:46:20.670
but it can be in that males are of equal
size sometimes but usually it's because

02:46:20.670 --> 02:46:20.680
size sometimes but usually it's because
 

02:46:20.680 --> 02:46:23.630
size sometimes but usually it's because
of the dominance factor within hyenas

02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:23.640
of the dominance factor within hyenas
 

02:46:23.640 --> 02:46:26.099
of the dominance factor within hyenas
females often are the matriarch of the

02:46:26.099 --> 02:46:26.109
females often are the matriarch of the
 

02:46:26.109 --> 02:46:28.499
females often are the matriarch of the
clan and therefore that kind of role

02:46:28.499 --> 02:46:28.509
clan and therefore that kind of role
 

02:46:28.509 --> 02:46:31.469
clan and therefore that kind of role
that they take on allows into to

02:46:31.469 --> 02:46:31.479
that they take on allows into to
 

02:46:31.479 --> 02:46:33.420
that they take on allows into to
developing it begins stronger and they

02:46:33.420 --> 02:46:33.430
developing it begins stronger and they
 

02:46:33.430 --> 02:46:35.519
developing it begins stronger and they
then you know produce a little bit more

02:46:35.519 --> 02:46:35.529
then you know produce a little bit more
 

02:46:35.529 --> 02:46:36.689
then you know produce a little bit more
kind of testosterone and grow a little

02:46:36.689 --> 02:46:36.699
kind of testosterone and grow a little
 

02:46:36.699 --> 02:46:38.639
kind of testosterone and grow a little
bit bigger than the males sometimes it's

02:46:38.639 --> 02:46:38.649
bit bigger than the males sometimes it's
 

02:46:38.649 --> 02:46:41.249
bit bigger than the males sometimes it's
like I said not always the case but

02:46:41.249 --> 02:46:41.259
like I said not always the case but
 

02:46:41.259 --> 02:46:42.300
like I said not always the case but
that's the reason it's just the role

02:46:42.300 --> 02:46:42.310
that's the reason it's just the role
 

02:46:42.310 --> 02:46:44.489
that's the reason it's just the role
that they that they are that they have

02:46:44.489 --> 02:46:44.499
that they that they are that they have
 

02:46:44.499 --> 02:46:47.239
that they that they are that they have
within the sort of clan is you know the

02:46:47.239 --> 02:46:47.249
within the sort of clan is you know the
 

02:46:47.249 --> 02:46:50.969
within the sort of clan is you know the
dominant side of the sexes if you want

02:46:50.969 --> 02:46:50.979
dominant side of the sexes if you want
 

02:46:50.979 --> 02:46:53.519
dominant side of the sexes if you want
to call it that two females tend to be a

02:46:53.519 --> 02:46:53.529
to call it that two females tend to be a
 

02:46:53.529 --> 02:46:54.929
to call it that two females tend to be a
lot more dominant in the male is

02:46:54.929 --> 02:46:54.939
lot more dominant in the male is
 

02:46:54.939 --> 02:46:56.550
lot more dominant in the male is
although they are cases of males

02:46:56.550 --> 02:46:56.560
although they are cases of males
 

02:46:56.560 --> 02:46:59.880
although they are cases of males
dominating a clan and obviously males do

02:46:59.880 --> 02:46:59.890
dominating a clan and obviously males do
 

02:46:59.890 --> 02:47:03.449
dominating a clan and obviously males do
inherit two females lineage and her sort

02:47:03.449 --> 02:47:03.459
inherit two females lineage and her sort
 

02:47:03.459 --> 02:47:06.569
inherit two females lineage and her sort
of rank when they born so you know it's

02:47:06.569 --> 02:47:06.579
of rank when they born so you know it's
 

02:47:06.579 --> 02:47:08.489
of rank when they born so you know it's
it's not always the case that females

02:47:08.489 --> 02:47:08.499
it's not always the case that females
 

02:47:08.499 --> 02:47:11.219
it's not always the case that females
are that much larger than males it's a

02:47:11.219 --> 02:47:11.229
are that much larger than males it's a
 

02:47:11.229 --> 02:47:12.689
are that much larger than males it's a
bit of a misconception that they they

02:47:12.689 --> 02:47:12.699
bit of a misconception that they they
 

02:47:12.699 --> 02:47:15.719
bit of a misconception that they they
massively larger animals all the time

02:47:15.719 --> 02:47:15.729
massively larger animals all the time
 

02:47:15.729 --> 02:47:18.059
massively larger animals all the time
but in some instances and certainly

02:47:18.059 --> 02:47:18.069
but in some instances and certainly
 

02:47:18.069 --> 02:47:19.559
but in some instances and certainly
within the gym okay and the females are

02:47:19.559 --> 02:47:19.569
within the gym okay and the females are
 

02:47:19.569 --> 02:47:21.749
within the gym okay and the females are
bigger in the males and Sidney much more

02:47:21.749 --> 02:47:21.759
bigger in the males and Sidney much more
 

02:47:21.759 --> 02:47:24.329
bigger in the males and Sidney much more
bulky then what the males are and that's

02:47:24.329 --> 02:47:24.339
bulky then what the males are and that's
 

02:47:24.339 --> 02:47:25.979
bulky then what the males are and that's
due to the fact that the females in this

02:47:25.979 --> 02:47:25.989
due to the fact that the females in this
 

02:47:25.989 --> 02:47:28.139
due to the fact that the females in this
particular van are hugely dominant over

02:47:28.139 --> 02:47:28.149
particular van are hugely dominant over
 

02:47:28.149 --> 02:47:31.619
particular van are hugely dominant over
the males at this stage now our ribbon

02:47:31.619 --> 02:47:31.629
the males at this stage now our ribbon
 

02:47:31.629 --> 02:47:33.119
the males at this stage now our ribbon
is lying in the worst possible spot you

02:47:33.119 --> 02:47:33.129
is lying in the worst possible spot you
 

02:47:33.129 --> 02:47:34.800
is lying in the worst possible spot you
can see just to you know I and so I'm

02:47:34.800 --> 02:47:34.810
can see just to you know I and so I'm
 

02:47:34.810 --> 02:47:36.059
can see just to you know I and so I'm
sure the little ones are probably

02:47:36.059 --> 02:47:36.069
sure the little ones are probably
 

02:47:36.069 --> 02:47:40.260
sure the little ones are probably
suckling em really nicely I'm just down

02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:40.270
suckling em really nicely I'm just down
 

02:47:40.270 --> 02:47:41.819
suckling em really nicely I'm just down
the slope but we're never going to be

02:47:41.819 --> 02:47:41.829
the slope but we're never going to be
 

02:47:41.829 --> 02:47:43.679
the slope but we're never going to be
able to see inside there unfortunately

02:47:43.679 --> 02:47:43.689
able to see inside there unfortunately
 

02:47:43.689 --> 02:47:45.779
able to see inside there unfortunately
and that's because of the sort of

02:47:45.779 --> 02:47:45.789
and that's because of the sort of
 

02:47:45.789 --> 02:47:46.960
and that's because of the sort of
relative

02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:46.970
relative
 

02:47:46.970 --> 02:47:48.939

sort of depth of that slope and and

02:47:48.939 --> 02:47:48.949
sort of depth of that slope and and
 

02:47:48.949 --> 02:47:50.800
sort of depth of that slope and and

able to see the little ones unless they
 

02:47:55.100 --> 02:47:56.559
able to see the little ones unless they
finish suckling and they come poke up

02:47:56.559 --> 02:47:56.569

sprayer and these guys do what's called

02:48:42.819 --> 02:48:42.829
sprayer and these guys do what's called
 

02:48:42.829 --> 02:48:44.889
sprayer and these guys do what's called
anal pasting and so they have a little

02:48:44.889 --> 02:48:44.899
anal pasting and so they have a little
 

02:48:44.899 --> 02:48:46.449
anal pasting and so they have a little
gland that's underneath the anus that

gland that's underneath the anus that
 

02:48:46.459 --> 02:48:48.189
gland that's underneath the anus that
they walk around and they'll paste

02:48:48.189 --> 02:48:48.199
they walk around and they'll paste
 

02:48:48.199 --> 02:48:50.080
they walk around and they'll paste
they'll secretes a paste from that that

02:48:50.080 --> 02:48:50.090
they'll secretes a paste from that that
 

02:48:50.090 --> 02:48:52.359
they'll secretes a paste from that that
they'll wipe on grasses and that will be

02:48:52.359 --> 02:48:52.369
they'll wipe on grasses and that will be
 

02:48:52.369 --> 02:48:54.609
they'll wipe on grasses and that will be
their way of marking their territories

02:48:54.609 --> 02:48:54.619
their way of marking their territories
 

02:48:54.619 --> 02:48:56.260
their way of marking their territories
obviously they also do difficut in your

02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:56.270
obviously they also do difficut in your
 

02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:58.779
obviously they also do difficut in your
own eye too but really the pasting is is

02:48:58.779 --> 02:48:58.789
own eye too but really the pasting is is
 

02:48:58.789 --> 02:49:00.699
own eye too but really the pasting is is
their huge marker that they lay down

02:49:00.699 --> 02:49:00.709
their huge marker that they lay down
 

02:49:00.709 --> 02:49:03.460
their huge marker that they lay down
when patrolling around and yes they will

02:49:03.460 --> 02:49:03.470
when patrolling around and yes they will
 

02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:05.559
when patrolling around and yes they will
patrol as well you must remember that

02:49:05.559 --> 02:49:05.569
patrol as well you must remember that
 

02:49:05.569 --> 02:49:06.910
patrol as well you must remember that
hyenas because they live in these

02:49:06.910 --> 02:49:06.920
hyenas because they live in these
 

02:49:06.920 --> 02:49:09.099
hyenas because they live in these
tight-knit family groups there's always

02:49:09.099 --> 02:49:09.109
tight-knit family groups there's always
 

02:49:09.109 --> 02:49:10.599
tight-knit family groups there's always
going to be other hyenas on the borders

02:49:10.599 --> 02:49:10.609
going to be other hyenas on the borders
 

02:49:10.609 --> 02:49:12.040
going to be other hyenas on the borders
that are in their own family groups and

02:49:12.040 --> 02:49:12.050
that are in their own family groups and
 

02:49:12.050 --> 02:49:14.080
that are in their own family groups and
so they will patrol to try and keep them

02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:14.090
so they will patrol to try and keep them
 

02:49:14.090 --> 02:49:15.880
so they will patrol to try and keep them
heart and allow them to have resources

02:49:15.880 --> 02:49:15.890
heart and allow them to have resources
 

02:49:15.890 --> 02:49:18.580
heart and allow them to have resources
for dens and food and water and all

02:49:18.580 --> 02:49:18.590
for dens and food and water and all
 

02:49:18.590 --> 02:49:20.739
for dens and food and water and all
those kind of things so hyenas are very

02:49:20.739 --> 02:49:20.749
those kind of things so hyenas are very
 

02:49:20.749 --> 02:49:23.830
those kind of things so hyenas are very
very much active patrollers and like I

02:49:23.830 --> 02:49:23.840
very much active patrollers and like I
 

02:49:23.840 --> 02:49:25.439
very much active patrollers and like I
say they do you actively mark territory

02:49:25.439 --> 02:49:25.449
say they do you actively mark territory
 

02:49:25.449 --> 02:49:30.189
say they do you actively mark territory
as well it's quite odd just to have half

02:49:30.189 --> 02:49:30.199
as well it's quite odd just to have half
 

02:49:30.199 --> 02:49:32.500
as well it's quite odd just to have half
a hidden in here kind of poking out of a

02:49:32.500 --> 02:49:32.510
a hidden in here kind of poking out of a
 

02:49:32.510 --> 02:49:34.569
a hidden in here kind of poking out of a
dingy sort of termite hole

02:49:34.569 --> 02:49:34.579
dingy sort of termite hole
 

02:49:34.579 --> 02:49:36.550
dingy sort of termite hole
the other little ones I think by the

02:49:36.550 --> 02:49:36.560
the other little ones I think by the
 

02:49:36.560 --> 02:49:38.019
the other little ones I think by the
looks of things have found themselves a

02:49:38.019 --> 02:49:38.029
looks of things have found themselves a
 

02:49:38.029 --> 02:49:39.790
looks of things have found themselves a
little spot right up from the on the

02:49:39.790 --> 02:49:39.800
little spot right up from the on the
 

02:49:39.800 --> 02:49:41.139
little spot right up from the on the
mound where you can't really see them

02:49:41.139 --> 02:49:41.149
mound where you can't really see them
 

02:49:41.149 --> 02:49:43.290
mound where you can't really see them
they kind of hidden behind bushes and

02:49:43.290 --> 02:49:43.300
they kind of hidden behind bushes and
 

02:49:43.300 --> 02:49:45.699
they kind of hidden behind bushes and
look very happy with themselves up in

02:49:45.699 --> 02:49:45.709
look very happy with themselves up in
 

02:49:45.709 --> 02:49:46.899
look very happy with themselves up in
the top there you can just see a bit of

02:49:46.899 --> 02:49:46.909
the top there you can just see a bit of
 

02:49:46.909 --> 02:49:49.000
the top there you can just see a bit of
movement every now and then in that

02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:49.010
movement every now and then in that
 

02:49:49.010 --> 02:49:50.740
movement every now and then in that
little area

02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:50.750
little area
 

02:49:50.750 --> 02:49:54.160
little area
they driven I think is suckling them and

02:49:54.160 --> 02:49:54.170
they driven I think is suckling them and
 

02:49:54.170 --> 02:49:55.179
they driven I think is suckling them and
then she's probably going to leave

02:49:55.179 --> 02:49:55.189
then she's probably going to leave
 

02:49:55.189 --> 02:49:56.950
then she's probably going to leave
that's what I would imagine is going to

02:49:56.950 --> 02:49:56.960
that's what I would imagine is going to
 

02:49:56.960 --> 02:49:59.110
that's what I would imagine is going to
happen with these guys is that they can
