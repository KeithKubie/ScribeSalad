00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
In today's video, we're
building an optical illusion.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.300
It looks like a waterfall,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.060
but it's underwater,
and it's small enough

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.320
that you can have
it in your house.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:12.240
[Music]

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.140
I'm Nate.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.720
And I'm Calli, and today,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.640
I'm going to teach you
how you can make

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.040
your own underwater waterfall.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.445
What it looks
like is a waterfall,

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:23.860
but it's already under water.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.300
I can show you how to do that.

00:00:25.314 --> 00:00:26.737
So here's the basic idea.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.320
With some supplies
from your local hardware store

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.420
and pet store,

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.800
you can use sand
and air to create

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.860
an optical illusion underwater.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.940
The supplies that we have
here are actually available

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.880
at most local stores.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.340
So we have got
some rigid insulation foam,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.420
some PVC pipes,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.200
and a PCL bend,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.360
bamboo skewers, the Great Stuff,
an air pump, aquarium tubing.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.460
This is what is called
an air stone,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.440
and some sand.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.660
Too fine of a grit,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.340
and what you're going
to get instead

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.002
of a nice beautiful waterfall
is actually very cloudy water.

00:01:01.002 --> 00:01:02.440
Too course of a sand,

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.580
and what you're going to end up
with is a waterfall

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.600
that just doesn't work.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.600
So to begin with,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.854
we're going to need
our bamboo skewers,

00:01:08.854 --> 00:01:11.050
a really really
good box cutter knife,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.862
and the foam,

00:01:11.862 --> 00:01:13.800
and the glue gun,
and with that,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.300
we can start assembling.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.500
So not all tank pumps
are created equal.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.532
This is a 3.5 watt.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.740
You want a stronger pump,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.774
even if this
doesn't seem stronger,

00:01:24.774 --> 00:01:27.521
this is good for a 20
to 30 gallon tank.

00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:29.492
We're using a 10 gallon tank.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:31.938
We're not just using
the 2 inch piece

00:01:31.938 --> 00:01:35.200
of rigid insulation foam just
for stability sake,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.800
this is also

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.320
because you can carve
into it really nicely.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.800
Makes it a lot easier
than trying to add

00:01:40.802 --> 00:01:42.684
a 4 inch layer of expanding foam

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:44.760
that's going to take
a week to dry.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.900
All right, we've got
all of our supplies.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.040
So let's start assembling.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.820
The first step is to measure and
cut our rigid insulation foam.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.860
The foam is going to end
up floating a lot on water

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:55.750
if we just put it
in there by itself,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.960
but the tank does have this sort
of lip along the top edge,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.240
and so even though we're going to add
some anchors on the bottom,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.250
we want to try and make sure
that it's pretty snug,

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.760
so it holds itself in place.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.280
So it doesn't end
up floating up.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.940
The back of our tank is going
to have one piece of foam

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.780
that runs aways,

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.609
and then it's going to turn
a little bit of an angle,

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:11.820
and we're going
to use that turn,

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.340
partly for decorative effect,

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.160
but also because we need to hide
some of the hardware behind it.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.460
Looks like we need to go
to about 11 and 1/4 inches high,

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.300
but we are going to have some
attachment points on the bottom

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.860
that should add a little bit
of thickness to it.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.620
So 14 by 11 and 1/4.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.320
[Music]

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.220
So to remind you
that the piece of hardware

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.260
that we're hiding is
a one-inch piece of PVC.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.020
It has to be able
to fit in here,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.080
and plenty of room
to catch our waterfall

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.840
without it being seen.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.550
This piece is the same height,
so it should fit nicely.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.400
But now it needs to be made
to fit kind of right here.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.140
[Music]

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.500
Our exacto knife wasn't quite
long enough for this cut.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.020
So I'm just using a saw.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.940
Yes, they are in place.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.963
Yes, they're not
really going anywhere.

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:05.320
However, we want to carve this
up to make it look like rocks.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.000
We want to add some expanding
foam for the same reason,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.500
so we have more room to carve.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.093
We need these two pieces
to never come apart.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.212
So now, we got to
glue them together.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.135
I'm going to break off
a few bamboo skewers,

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:19.225
so that everything
stays in place.

00:03:19.225 --> 00:03:22.240
So that when we pop
this out, nothing moves.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
So that we glue it
in the right position.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.360
And then after that,
we will add our expanding foam.

00:03:27.366 --> 00:03:29.366
This is a little
mist spray bottle.

00:03:29.366 --> 00:03:30.960
Just has some warm water in it,

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.300
and this can help make the foam
cure just a little bit faster.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.780
[Music]

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.960
Where the waterfall itself goes,

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.620
add a little bit more,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.300
and the reason why is because
you want to be able to choose

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.540
how your waterfall
is going to flow.

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.800
The more foam that you have,

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.420
the more options you have
for carving it out.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.133
And if you go
a little bit overboard,

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.800
that's fine.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.140
This is not a hard
stuff to carve,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.459
so we can fix that in minutes.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.550
Fix it and post.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.320
So think about cliffs.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.400
Think about the way that rock
formations kind of jut out.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.629
You've got those
little overhangs,

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:06.637
things like that.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.880
Now, it's decorative.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.640
We've got a lot of foam on here,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.420
and even though we've added
some spray water

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.720
to try and speed up the cure time,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.500
it's going to take quite a while
before it's ready to be carved.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.740
So we're gonna actually let
this cure like over the weekend

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.420
before we start cutting into it.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.160
In the meantime,

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.900
we've got some mechanical
parts we can build.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.020
We're actually going
to build the pump itself,

00:04:26.024 --> 00:04:27.190
so we can even show you

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.890
how that's going
to fit into place,

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.441
how it's going to work,
and even give it a test run.

00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.380
L bracket...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.060
Yes.

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.900
And we did drill a hole in this,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.120
so that our hose connection
be threaded down into it.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.880
Exactly.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:38.840
This is going to be

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.240
what actually causes
the air flow to bring

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.400
our waterfall up in just a bit.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.040
[Music]

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.900
It fits down,

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:50.400
and you don't end up
with a kink in the line.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.440
That will cause
the air flow to stop.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.150
When you have an L bracket,

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.160
there's about a 3/4
of an inch lip there,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.600
and what that does is hold
the PVC piece in place.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.780
So when you put it in,
you lose that amount of PVC.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.740
So you want to make sure you do

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:07.900
that first so you get
a correct measurement.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.449
Now, what we're going
to do is figure out exactly

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:11.874
how high we want this to be.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:12.933
This is upside down.

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:15.532
Just so you know,
this is not the way it goes.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.660
For measuring purposes only.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.300
Yes.

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:17.980
Is that--

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.580
So that's the height of the top
of the pipes should--

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:20.789
This will be the top
of the pipe.

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.850
Now, you've got to remember
this is going to go through.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.380
The reason we're doing this

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.340
is that the top of the pipe
will go through,

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.860
and then we're going
to have a lip,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.120
we'll explain that later.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.880
So now, we're going to cut
our PVC to about that point.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:38.120
[Music]

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.820
Beautiful.

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.800
It's actually going
to go in the corner.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.340
I know that seems
a little bit odd.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.232
The reason why,

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.820
so when the water in the
underwater waterfall gathers,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.860
it's going to come
down at an angle.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.240
You want to make sure
it can all be caught.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.100
Now, this will of
course be in here.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.350
It's going to be
a little bit easier,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.644
but gives you an idea.

00:05:54.644 --> 00:05:57.697
You want it all to kind of
gather in this little triangle.

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.920
The point of an air stone is
that it oxygenates the water.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.280
It makes it a little bit easier
for the fish themselves

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:04.734
to you know, be happy.

00:06:04.734 --> 00:06:06.560
This air pump is designed to just,

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:09.980
I mean, to pump air through
the hose down into the air stone.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:11.280
If we didn't have the air stone,

00:06:11.299 --> 00:06:14.261
all of the bubbles just come out
here is pretty big bubbles,

00:06:14.261 --> 00:06:15.849
and the goal is to actually

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:18.549
to get the oxygen
to dissolve into the water.

00:06:18.549 --> 00:06:20.940
We're going to be using
are to lift the sand.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.540
So this tube and stone will go
inside of our PVC pipe.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.514
When it gets surrounded by sand,

00:06:26.514 --> 00:06:28.849
the air bubbles flying
up will lift some

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:30.360
of that sand with it,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.192
and then that gets
poured out the top.

00:06:32.192 --> 00:06:33.051
But right now,

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.740
if we had this air stone inside
the PVC set on the ground,

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:37.880
no sand could get to it.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.260
So we need to give
the sand an access point

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:41.560
into our PVC pipe.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.860
So this actually has two pumps.

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.220
But I'm only using one.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:48.500
So, is there a correct
way to couple this?

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.000
Yes.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.860
Am I going to jerry-rig it?

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.500
Yes.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.680
[Music]

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.300
So then, it just comes down

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.518
to how close do you want
the pump to your tank.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.960
So I like to give it
a little bit of room,

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:05.794
which is actually good.

00:07:05.794 --> 00:07:06.900
That's what I've got.

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:09.438
So we'll do
that side about there,

00:07:09.438 --> 00:07:12.060
and then we'll have just enough.

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.000
[Music]

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.880
Plug it.

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.780
[Music]

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:23.000
Seems pretty sealed.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.020
All right, let's try it.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.420
Go and lift it up.

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:27.220
Let's see.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.840
We've got a nice water flow,
that's actually decent.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:33.418
See how high you can lift it up,
and still get a water flow.

00:07:33.418 --> 00:07:35.132
Okay, so a couple inches
out of the water,

00:07:35.132 --> 00:07:35.870
but that's fine.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:37.950
This whole thing is going
to stay submerged,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.450
and will be nice and quiet.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:41.940
So now, let's see
if we can add some sand.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:44.440
And now we're covered in it.

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:45.757
That should be enough.

00:07:45.757 --> 00:07:47.422
So let's go and test it out.

00:07:47.528 --> 00:07:49.143
Okay, so far so good.

00:07:49.143 --> 00:07:56.800
[Music]

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.620
Okay.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:58.280
Okay.

00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.860
&gt;&gt; Sand is falling.
&gt;&gt; So you can see--

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.760
Now, this is pretty cool.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.520
You can see that even

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:02.940
though we've been
pumping the sand,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.700
the water has stayed
pretty nice and clear,

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:08.160
and that's because we did a lot
of work to clean our sand.

00:08:08.168 --> 00:08:09.227
I know, it's sand,

00:08:09.229 --> 00:08:10.797
it's not going
to get not sandy.

00:08:10.797 --> 00:08:13.897
But what we're trying to do is
remove the extra small particles

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.840
that would just float
throughout the water,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.356
and make it really hard
to see through.

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.120
So let's take a look
at how we can clean off

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.800
our sand to get only the size
of particles that we want.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:24.740
This is some
of our unwashed sand,

00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:26.960
and you can see
that when I add water to it,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.020
the water gets really murky.

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:30.080
You swirl it
around a little bit,

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:31.200
and the water is getting murky.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.620
That's what we're
trying to remove.

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:34.560
We're going to pour all
this sand into a sieve,

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.220
and then rinse it
off with a hose.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.000
[Music]

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.660
Now, we can see
that it's full of water,

00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:45.860
but even if we just get
the sand swirling up a bit,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.440
it immediately
settles back down,

00:08:47.451 --> 00:08:48.700
and it's clear again.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.800
That's because we've
washed all of the dirt

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.010
and silt off of the sand.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.400
We just have the larger grains,
nothing to murk up the water.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:56.320
So that's what we need to do

00:08:56.321 --> 00:08:58.721
with our sand before running
it through our pump,

00:08:58.721 --> 00:09:00.580
or the whole tank is just
going to go cloudy.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.720
All right, so it's been
a least 48 hours,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.360
and our expanding
foam is very dry.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.440
So now, it's ready to be carved.

00:09:07.449 --> 00:09:08.949
We're going to carve that out.

00:09:08.949 --> 00:09:10.450
We're going to add
in our pump system,

00:09:10.450 --> 00:09:12.460
and then we're going to make
sure everything looks nice

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.380
and decorated at all.

00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:15.000
Next part is just making sure

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.860
that we know where the waterfall
itself is going to be,

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.780
so placement.

00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:21.207
We kind of formed
this little ledge here,

00:09:21.207 --> 00:09:22.089
because we know

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:24.850
that we want the waterfall
to come out of this area.

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.750
Then we're going
to form sort of a pool

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.243
for everything to fall into,

00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:29.950
and then it's going to fall back

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:32.100
so that we have
a full circular system.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:34.120
All the air and sand
will be coming up,

00:09:34.129 --> 00:09:35.629
and getting shot
out the front,

00:09:35.629 --> 00:09:37.129
and we don't want it shooting.

00:09:37.129 --> 00:09:38.300
We want it falling.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.080
So what we need to do is carve
into the foam a little bit,

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:42.520
and then have it slope.

00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.940
So the sand hits
that sloped portion,

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.000
and just gets angled down
to our waterfall area.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.680
We have a spot marked off here,

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.318
and we need to carve
into the foam,

00:09:51.318 --> 00:09:52.777
and then down a little bit.

00:09:52.777 --> 00:09:55.750
So there's going to be some
tricky angles going on here.

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:58.200
I think we'll probably use
the drill a little bit.

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.207
But because we don't want
to just go straight through,

00:10:00.207 --> 00:10:02.077
we're not going to drill
like a tunnel into it.

00:10:02.077 --> 00:10:03.920
We're just going to carve
it out a little bit,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.105
and we now need to add

00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:07.950
sort of like angled hole
aiming out that direction,

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.562
at about 45 degrees.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.120
As far as the drop,
we've already got that set.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.580
Now what we need is
we need a feedback loop.

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:16.520
We need to carve

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.038
like a receiving pool where all
the sand is going to land,

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.700
and flow back down
to the bottom of that pipe.

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:23.940
Trial and error has taught me
that the best way to do

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:26.320
that is actually the carve
from the back again.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.500
We're going to start here.

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.500
We're going to make
a little mark.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.900
We're going to carve upward,

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.100
and then once we figure out
where that's going to come up,

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:34.100
then we can start
aesthetically carving.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.472
And up here, we'll open
that up as well.

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.240
We'll recess this
whole area back in,

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.860
so the waterfall has
more area to fall.

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.560
Hopefully, we'll try
and make it look like a rock.

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:51.520
[Music]

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.120
We've got our foam carved
out to look like rocks.

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.000
I think we're pretty
much ready to go on that.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.420
So next step is to make
it look like rocks.

00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:00.760
We've got some good shapes,
but we don't have good colors.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:02.040
I think it's time to paint this.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.440
So when it comes to painting
something like this,

00:11:04.443 --> 00:11:05.955
you don't have
to break the bank.

00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.160
These are of course,
just regular acrylic paint

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.880
that you can get
at any craft store.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.498
Now, the important thing is

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.080
if you're going to be putting
something living in this tank,

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.660
you don't want foam acrylic.

00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:17.900
That's bad.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:19.760
So we have Plasti Dip.

00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:22.150
Now, everything that I
have read online says that

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.032
if we can coat this well enough,

00:11:24.032 --> 00:11:25.850
multiple times with Plasti Dip,

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:28.050
it should be safe
for aquatic animals.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:30.160
Now, don't take my word for it.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.410
I don't want to kill your fish.

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.550
So once you do this,
once you let it dry,

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.363
once everything seems
like it's working,

00:11:35.363 --> 00:11:38.200
and you have a filtration system
running for a couple of days,

00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.400
go get the water tested.

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.900
And if everything works out,
it should be all right to go.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:53.800
[Music]

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.400
Here's the plan.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.897
Acrylic paint
dries pretty quick,

00:11:55.897 --> 00:11:58.197
but we want to speed
that process up even more.

00:11:58.197 --> 00:11:59.782
So we're going to put
in front of fan.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:05.422
This is what I use to blow
dry my hair every morning!

00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:11.680
Takes about two seconds.

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:20.280
[Music]

00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:20.900
Okay.

00:12:20.902 --> 00:12:22.032
Okay.

00:12:22.032 --> 00:12:26.750
So we had industrial
velcro strips that you can put

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.320
on the bottom of this
to hold this in place.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:31.200
However, this tank

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.643
has a lip that's going
to hold it in place.

00:12:33.643 --> 00:12:35.350
We made this very close fitting

00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.981
to the size of the tank,
which it was really difficult

00:12:37.981 --> 00:12:39.523
for us to squish it
down into the tank.

00:12:39.523 --> 00:12:41.186
But now that it's in there,
it's in there.

00:12:41.186 --> 00:12:43.500
I'm quite confident we'll be
able to fill this with water.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:43.899
Yeah.

00:12:43.899 --> 00:12:46.050
Okay, so we
have got our backing,

00:12:46.050 --> 00:12:47.660
we've got our tank.

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.740
Now, let's go ahead and actually
get the waterfall in place.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:55.040
And that should fit
snug in the place.

00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.620
Perfect.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.480
We have a double hose
for this air pump.

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.560
We're going to start with one,

00:13:00.562 --> 00:13:02.344
see if we need
more power than that.

00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:04.540
All right, let's make
it pretty first.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.498
Let's see if I
can even get these--

00:13:06.498 --> 00:13:08.127
We made like a little cave.

00:13:08.127 --> 00:13:08.927
I want to see

00:13:08.927 --> 00:13:10.760
if I can even get
these in here now.

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.140
Oh yeah, okay.

00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:15.080
I will never be able
to move them,

00:13:15.088 --> 00:13:16.642
but I can get them.

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:19.550
Some of our larger ones,
we also painted gold,

00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:20.460
just for pretty.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:25.740
[Music]

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:27.100
You can kind of see

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.220
where we've got
our tube going down.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.340
Now, we're going to go ahead,
and add the sand first,

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.160
and then we're going
to fill this with water.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:34.200
See what happens.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.940
[Music]

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:39.340
The water is a little
cloudy right now.

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.900
I may have forgotten to rinse
the rocks that I got.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:44.932
If you were to coat this
so it was safe for a fish,

00:13:44.932 --> 00:13:46.249
or anything like that,

00:13:46.249 --> 00:13:49.191
and you were to put in
an actual filtration system,

00:13:49.191 --> 00:13:50.720
that'd be gone in an hour.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.000
We won't have any problems.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.740
All right, so we
have assembled our tank.

00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:56.160
We have let
the water settle,

00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.596
and I added a pet.

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.640
His name is Steve.

00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:00.500
Should we get to actually see
if this works?

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.400
Let's try it.

00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:03.734
So you can obviously tell
when you get up close

00:14:03.734 --> 00:14:04.534
that it is sand,

00:14:04.534 --> 00:14:06.734
but just as a decoration
in your living room,

00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:08.280
if somebody sees us
from across the room,

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.600
it really does look
like an underwater waterfall.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.660
It's really cool.

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:29.100
[Music]

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.240
Guys, that's not all,

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.540
we've always got more
for you to see.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:33.612
This box up at the top will take
you to our latest video,

00:14:33.612 --> 00:14:34.787
and that box at the bottom is

00:14:34.787 --> 00:14:36.671
what YouTube thinks you
should be watching next.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:39.280
And if you're not subscribed,
hit that bomb in the middle.

00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:40.320
Don't forget to ring that bell,

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.400
and we'll see you
in the next one.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:42.240
Talk to you then.
