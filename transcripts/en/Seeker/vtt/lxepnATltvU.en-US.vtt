00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.330
Scientists just detected the universe’s
first molecule

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.030
using a telescope that we fly around the world
on a plane...and that’s a real sentence.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.590
Just let that sink in a little bit. That’s
the world we live in these days.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.310
The molecule in question is called helium
hydride and the fact that we’ve finally

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:21.930
detected it in space confirms some of our
theories about the behavior of the early universe,

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.470
and could help us understand more about how
the first stars and galaxies formed.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.610
If we start at the literal beginning, the
universe was a small singularity, a point

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.149
of infinite temperature and density.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.399
Maybe one second after the Big Bang—which
was something akin to an explosion but we

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.350
can’t exactly describe it as that—we’ve
got a flaming hot soup of particles. About

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.920
5 and half BILLION degrees celsius, to be
precise.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.319
A couple minutes in, the universe is mostly
helium but everything is ionized because there

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:55.059
are too many high-energy photons—they’re
flying around immediately knocking off any

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.729
electrons that may want to bind to the nuclei
of different elements to make them neutral.

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:03.979
But things have calmed down since then. In
the almost 14 billion years since the Big

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.390
Bang, the universe has cooled and expanded,
and as far as we know, will continue to do

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.390
so.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.950
About 380,000 years in, give or take a few—everything
cooled and slowed down enough that electrons

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.010
were able to stably bind to a helium nucleus
and TA-DA we have the first stable atom.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.700
So we have stable helium and a bunch of unstable
H+, the ionized form of hydrogen that hasn’t

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.070
gained its electron yet, and it’s looking
for a friend to share an electron.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.799
And would you lookee there, it’s helium
with two electrons, and hydrogen thinks it

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.050
just might want one!

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.939
So, the two get together to form the universe’s
very first molecule: helium hydride.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.799
This is where the chemistry stops being fun
to think about on just the atomic level—it

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.450
has galactic, nay, UNIVERSAL consequences.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.670
As things continue to cool down, neutral hydrogen
atoms become common because their electron

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.590
can finally stay attached.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.670
Energetically speaking, it’s now more efficient
for hydrogen to form molecules with itself,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.960
forming H2, than it is to glom on to helium
to form helium hydride.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.660
That means helium hydride starts to disappear,
giving way to high amounts of molecular hydrogen.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.140
Which is, arguably, the beginning of our modern
universe—being a fundamental component of

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.610
things like H2O, vital for beings like us,
of course.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.470
For astronomers, helium hydride is an essential
in-between step from the beginning to the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.470
now.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.720
It’s also thought that the formation and
then breakdown of this molecule, could have

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.440
been one of the main mechanisms through which
all the hot gases of the universe could cool

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.470
down enough to form stars in the first place.

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.650
And while scientists first started studying
the creation of helium hydride in the lab

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:52.120
back in 1925, astronomers have not been able
to find traces of it in space...until now.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.780
This latest news is the first time helium
hydride has been detected in its natural environment.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
Researchers used the Stratospheric Observatory
for Infrared Astronomy, or SOFIA—which is

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.540
basically a high-altitude plane carrying a
bunch of exciting equipment that helps us

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.220
look at space!

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.980
SOFIA carries one particular instrument called
the German Receiver for Astronomy at Terahertz

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.350
frequencies, or GREAT for short, which researchers
pointed at white-hot dying stars.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.130
And dingdingding, there it is, helium hydride
hanging out in planetary nebula NGC 7027.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.610
It’s important to point out that the helium
hydride being proclaimed in the headlines

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.640
is not actually the exact same molecule from
the beginning of our universe.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.760
I mean, yes they’re both helium hydride,
but it’s not the same helium hydride molecule—all

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.580
of those first helium hydride molecules made
at the beginning of the universe have long

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.680
since been broken apart and these are ones
that exist because these star environments

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.510
are hot enough to ionize hydrogen and make
it possible for helium hydride to exist again.

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.530
GREAT was able to see what we’ve been trying
to get a glimpse of for decades because

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.980
SOFIA operates at high enough altitude that
Earth’s atmosphere doesn’t get in the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.780
way of the kinds of signals it’s trying
to detect,

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.940
but it also is able to come down to Earth
and get upgrades, unlike space telescopes

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.760
which we’ve sent out into the dark with
no way to recover them and install new tech.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.320
A new development in terahertz technology
is what allowed us to perform this kind of

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.630
spectroscopy at the required wavelength.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.070
It’s thanks to brand new tech like this
that we’re able to confirm our current ideas

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.690
about the universe’s first moments—and
has led to a discovery that will hopefully

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:36.390
give us an even better understanding of the
formation of early stars and galaxies.
