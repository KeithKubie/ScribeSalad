00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And looking at this data,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
it certainly appears that one can see

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
a linear relationship, perhaps something like

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
this line

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
looks like it might describe how they relate.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
But there's a fair bit of variation around it,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
so I would say that the relationship is linear

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
but not exact.
