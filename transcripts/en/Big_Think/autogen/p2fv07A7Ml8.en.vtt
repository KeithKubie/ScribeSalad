defined sense of self so you're looking
 

00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.010
defined sense of self so you're looking
for an organization that also has

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:21.020
for an organization that also has
 

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.280
for an organization that also has
defined itself and ultimately both you
