00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.500
Before describing the technical
requirements for virtualization,

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.960
let's take a look at
the Two Main Virtualization Models.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.899
The two popular models for
virtualization are called Bare-metal or

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.300
Hypervisor-based and Hosted.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.866
They are also often referred to as (type
1) for the Hypervisor-based model and

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:23.140
(type 2) for the Hosted model for
virtualization solutions.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.030
The Bare-metal model is like
what we illustrated before.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.820
A virtual machine monitor or
hypervisor is responsible for

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.070
the management of
the physical resources, and

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.310
it supports execution of
entire virtual machine.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.200
One issue with this model are devices.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.700
According to the model, the hypervisor
must manage all possible devices, or

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.340
stated differently, device manufacturers
now have to provide the device drivers,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.380
not just for the different
operating systems, but also for

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.820
the different hypervisors
that are out there.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.870
To illuminate this,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.390
the hypervisor model typically
integrates a special virtual machine.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.790
Like a service VM that runs
a standard operating system and

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.500
has full hardware privileges to
access and perform any kind of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.420
hardware manipulation just like if
you were in need of BMV hardware.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.920
It is this privilege VM then that would
run all of the device drivers and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.450
would have control over how
the devices on the platform are used.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.950
The service VM also runs some
other management tasks and

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.820
configuration tasks that specifies
exactly how the hypervisor

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.050
would share the resources across
the guest VMs, for instance.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.788
This model is adapted by the Xen
virtualization solution,

00:01:42.788 --> 00:01:47.550
as, and also by the VMware's hypervisor,
the ESX hypervisor.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.260
Regarding Xen, both when it comes
to the open source version,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.360
as well as the version that's
supported by Citrix, the Xen server.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.730
The VMs that are run in the virtualized
environment are referred to as domains.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:03.580
The privileged domain is called dom 0,
and

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.095
the guest VMs are referred to as domUs.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.620
Xen is the actual hypervisor and

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:14.130
all of the drivers are running in
the privileged domain, in dom 0.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.710
So the management of all of
the devices has to involve

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.468
the execution of the drivers
that are part of dom 0.

00:02:21.468 --> 00:02:25.790
Given that VMware and
its hypervisors were first to market,

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.490
VMware still owns the largest
percentage of virtualized server cores.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.088
So these server cores
run the ESX hypervisor.

00:02:34.088 --> 00:02:38.990
Even this fact, viewers in
a position to actually mandate

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.030
from the vendors that they do provide
the drivers for the different devices.

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.960
That are going to be
part of the hypervisor.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.270
Now, this is not as bad because this
is really targeting the server.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.140
Part of the market space and

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.040
in servers in data centers there not
going to be that many devices or

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.200
there are going to be relatively
a fewer devices compared to what

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.540
you would see on your laptop or desktops
or in general the client platforms.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.610
To support a third party community
of developers VMware actually also

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.930
exports a number of APIs.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.590
So this not just for
the sake of the developers, but

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.520
also for users when they want to
configure exactly the kinds of policies

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.180
that will be enforced by the hypervisor.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.680
And in the past the ESX architecture
was such that there was

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.270
a control core,
a core domain, if you will,

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.462
that was based on a regular operating
system, it was based on Linux.

00:03:35.462 --> 00:03:36.240
But the right now,

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.820
all of the configuration related
tasks are configured via remote APIs.
