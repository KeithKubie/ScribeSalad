00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.610
- [Narrator] Welcome back.

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.430
So we've learned that it's important

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:05.670
to keep working through your frustrations

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.328
by using the right learning strategies.

00:00:07.328 --> 00:00:09.295
The more you work
through your frustration,

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.024
the more your brain grows, right.

00:00:11.024 --> 00:00:14.740
But it can be difficult to
work through that frustration

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.370
without a clear direction.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.920
That's why it's important to make

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.300
smart goals.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.133
It's an acronym.

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:21.890
It goes like this.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.100
Specific,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.270
measurable,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.320
actionable,

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.550
realistic,

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.383
timely.

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:28.216
Because look,

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:29.360
you can wish all you want

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.520
and say one day I'm gonna go to the moon.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.762
And you can want that like
your life depended on it.

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:35.300
But a wish

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.590
is not a goal.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.890
An example of a moon plan

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.320
that consists of smart goals

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.978
would go something like this.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:42.830
In 20 years,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.170
I will have studied enough
physics and chemistry,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.930
flown jet planes in the Air Force,

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.410
worked out four times a week,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.261
and gotten a job as a astronaut for NASA.

00:00:50.261 --> 00:00:53.165
And this will enable
me to fly a spacecraft

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:54.100
to the moon

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.596
and put my feet on it for science reasons.

00:00:55.596 --> 00:00:57.840
Specific.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.960
Put your feet on the moon.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.793
Measurable.

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:03.337
Are your feet touching
the surface of the moon?

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:04.780
Actionable.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.640
It is actionable,

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.070
that is to say doable,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.670
to study physics and chemistry,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.660
enlist in the Air Force,

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.340
and go to the gym.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.500
Realistic.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.991
It's hard, but it's not impossible

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:15.690
to become an astronaut.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.621
Timely, here's where
more realism kicks in.

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:20.470
You won't be able to go to the moon

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.410
as an astronaut overnight.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.542
20 years seems a little more reasonable.

00:01:24.542 --> 00:01:26.800
But let's take this back to a more

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.030
sensible time scale

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.610
and look at our friend, Thinky Pinky.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.710
Hey buddy.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.700
TP here is interested in pull ups,

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.690
wants to be able to lift their entire mass

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.520
with just the arms, this one.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.113
But pull ups are hard.

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:40.616
So let's take a look at Thinky
Pinky's reflection journal.

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:44.060
Quote, I want to be able to do

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.780
two consecutive pull ups
by the end of the year

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.380
by practicing pull ups at the gym

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.030
three times per week.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.440
Why is this a smart goal?

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.820
S is for specific.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.640
TP wants to work on pull ups.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.330
And they're not interested
in biking or weight training.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.020
There's one skill that Thinky Pinky

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.930
wants to work on

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.910
and that's pull ups.

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.320
M is for measurable.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.938
What's the metric for TP's success?

00:02:06.938 --> 00:02:08.370
Two in a row.

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.203
Two pull ups,

00:02:09.203 --> 00:02:10.640
one right after the other.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.850
You've either done it or you haven't.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.930
Measurable.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.540
A is for actionable.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.490
Can it be broken down
into individual tasks.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.330
Yeah.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.350
Go into the gym three
times a week to practice

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.080
feels very actionable indeed.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.060
R is for realistic.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.991
TP's not training to lift a car.

00:02:27.991 --> 00:02:29.761
Just some pull ups.

00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:32.300
T is for timely.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.010
There's a time limit on this.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.180
Thinky Pinky wants to do
this in a year's time.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.961
All together, that's smart
goal you got there, TP.

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:42.500
With the power of persistence,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.780
smart goals, and the right kind of help,

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.410
you can do anything you set your mind to.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.460
You can learn anything.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:50.513
Happy goal setting.
