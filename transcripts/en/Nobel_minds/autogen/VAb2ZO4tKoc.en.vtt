00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.970
    Reading changed dreams into life and life into dreams

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:13.900
 and placed the universe of literature within reach of the boy I once was.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:22.860
My mother told me the first things I wrote were continuations 
of the stories I read  

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:29.470
because it made me sad when they concluded 
or because I wanted to change their endings. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.970
And perhaps this is what I have spent my life doing 
without realizing it: 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:48.100
prolonging in time, as I grew, matured, and aged, the stories 
that filled my childhood with exaltation and adventures.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:01:00.230
I wish my mother were here, a woman who was moved to tears 
reading the poems of Amado Nervo and Pablo Neruda, 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.100
and Grandfather Pedro too, with his large nose 
and gleaming bald head, 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:16.070
who celebrated my verses, and Uncle Lucho, who urged me 
so energetically to throw myself body and soul 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.780
into writing even though literature, in that time and place, 
compensated its devotees so badly. 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:32.170
Throughout my life I have had people like that at my side, 
people who loved and encouraged me 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.920
and infected me with their faith when I had doubts.
