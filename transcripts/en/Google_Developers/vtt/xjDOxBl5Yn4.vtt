Scott Drake: So, some of the core benefits
when we looked at building a Google TV app,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.250
about 30, 40 percent of our content
has real time market data in there.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.125
When we understood that there was
an opportunity to work with Google

00:00:15.125 --> 00:00:17.083
to be able to present real time information,

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.917
we kind of jumped on it that way.

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:20.875
One of the core benefits for our product

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.958
is that we have real time data directly from
the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:27.750
that has data before,
during, and after market.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.208
So, when you have a merger happening
and there's an announcement,

00:00:30.208 --> 00:00:34.375
you can get data from 4AM to 8PM
and get real time information.

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:37.833
And it seems like our users
really crave real time,

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:41.583
up to date information
while having a video experience.

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.875
Himanshu Patel: So the app contains
basically three sections--

00:00:44.875 --> 00:00:47.083
My Stocks, Hot Stocks, and the Videos.

00:00:47.083 --> 00:00:49.833
My Stocks is basically a watch list
where you can customize your list.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.375
You can add or delete
your stocks information.

00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.750
If there's a video label
for any particular symbol,

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.542
you can click on the ticker on that 

00:00:56.542 --> 00:01:00.125
and a video can appear
on the [inaudible] video op panel.

00:01:00.125 --> 00:01:03.250
In-between that if you want to go
to the Video or Hot Stocks section,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.500
you can select any particular
symbol and play the video for that.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.708
Scott Drake: For us, we were able
to leverage a lot of our APIs

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:12.667
that we already traditionally had for mobile
and extend that through the Google TV product.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:17.583
It got us the ability to bring product probably
within a three month cycle to market.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.833
We want information agnostic
whatever platform or device they have.

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:28.375
So, if I enter my personalized
stock information that I care about,

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:29.958
the assets I wanna track,

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:34.000
I can update no matter on a phone
or a tablet or a desktop or a TV.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It follows me 
no matter where I am.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.375
And so, as we see, 
even in our industry,

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:40.875
a lot of financial professionals
are on the go.

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.833
They need that information
following them.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:47.250
Our audience was really in-sync
with having interaction

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.542
and be able to inter-personalize
information, interact with information.

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:54.833
I say any media company that has
an audience that wants to interact

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.500
is probably a good candidate
for Google TV.
