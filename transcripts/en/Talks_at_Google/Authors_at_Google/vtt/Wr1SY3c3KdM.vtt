00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.540
&gt;&gt;female presenter: Welcome to Authors at
Google.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.790
I'm Rebecca Moore, and I'm privileged to introduce
our speaker Dr. Victoria Sweet.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.099
I was going to talk about her new book, God's
Hotel: a Doctor, a Hospital, and a Pilgrimage

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.890
to the Heart of Medicine.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.439
The book launched just one month ago.

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.220
I think, as Googlers, we can relate to working
long and hard on something, maybe for more

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.220
than a year.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.200
You're passionate about it, you launch it,
and then you wait with some trepidation to

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.800
see what's going to happen.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.879
Well, the great news is that God's Hotel is
taking off like a rocket ship.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:40.150
We're very privileged to have Dr. Sweet with
us here to talk about it.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.820
In its first week, it made it onto the San
Francisco Chronicle Best Sellers list.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
Two days ago, it was just reviewed by the
New York Times' Science Times, who called

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.989
it "transcendent and a tour de force."

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.770
Congratulations on that.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.790
Dr. Sweet is both a physician and a prize-winning
historian with a Ph.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.129
D. in history and social medicine.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.890
She's also associate clinical professor of
medicine at UC San Francisco, and I'm personally

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.230
happy to say that she studied mathematics
and Greek at Stanford University.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.270
Go Stanford.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.050
[laughter]
There will be time for Q&amp;A at the end, and

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.260
Victoria will sign books for those of you
who would like them.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.030
Finally, just on a personal note, I've known
Victoria for many, many years.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.380
She has always been someone who was comfortable
taking the road less traveled.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.790
I think, now, with God's Hotel, she's created
a whole new road to a place and time that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.370
few of us even knew existed.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.230
And now she's here to tell us about it.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.040
Please welcome Dr. Victoria Sweet.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.340
[applause]

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.750
&gt;&gt;Victoria Sweet: Is that microphone working?

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.500
Well, thank you very much, Rebecca.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.420
Thank you all for being here today.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500
Thanks Google for letting me speak here.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:11.050
Laguna Honda Hospital was like no hospital
I had ever seen or even imagined.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.330
I got there kinda accidentally.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.810
I had decided to go back to school to get
my Ph.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.900
D. in medical history after I had been practicing
medicine for many years.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.999
Laguna Honda was the only place that would
let me practice medicine part time.

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:30.439
So I went over for my interview.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:34.200
When I saw it for the first time, I was nonplussed.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.480
It was high on a hill, overlooking the ocean,
and it looked like a medieval, Romanesque

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.989
monastery.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:51.120
It had peach colored walls, a red tiled roof,
a bell tower, and turrets.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.760
After my interview, the medical director took
me out to show me around.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.939
She showed me the long, open wards that go
all the way back to when monks took care of

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.439
the sick poor in the monasteries for free.

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.689
When went upstairs and she showed me the surgery
suite, which looks like where Humphrey Bogart

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.780
had his face redone in "Man Without a Face."

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.310
We walked past the old-fashioned beauty salon
with its steel helmet hairdryers.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.659
She showed me the library, the auditorium,
and the chapel, which was really more like

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.669
a small church with polished wooden pews,
stained glass windows, and the stations of

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:33.989
the cross along the walls.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.989
Then we went out and she showed me the gardens.

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.329
Turned out that Laguna Honda had been the
almshouse for the city, and it was on 62 acres.

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.409
It is still on 62 acres of land in the middle
of San Francisco.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.299
The gardens are extensive.

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.400
She showed me the greenhouse, the aviary,
and the little barnyard.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:01.719
So the patients could pot plants, watch chickens
hatch from eggs, and even see animals, even

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:03.879
if they were bed-bound.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.250
Then we walked back to her office, and she
offered me the job.

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.730
I didn't know.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:10.999
I wasn't sure.

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:16.870
I told her I would come for two months, but
I stayed for 20 years.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.049
Turned out to be a wonderful place to practice
medicine.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.680
Part of that was the place itself.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.980
The place was a great place to practice medicine
in terms of its spaciousness, kinda ramshackle.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.099
But what really made it incredible were the
patients, because it turns out that Laguna

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:39.150
Honda was the original almshouse for the city.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.600
That was how we used to take care of the sick
poor.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.160
That's how we used to take care of the sick
poor before there was health insurance.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.520
There would be a free county hospital and
a free county almshouse.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.740
The acutely ill would be taken care of in
the free county almshouse-- county hospital.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:00.201
And then, if they needed additional care or
nobody new what else to do with them, they

00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:02.200
were transferred to the almshouse.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.740
It used to be that every county in the country
had a free county hospital and a free county

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.949
almshouse, and that was how we took care of
the sick poor.

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:15.159
Starting in the '50s, the almshouses across
the United States were closed, and many of

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:20.150
the county hospitals, except for San Francisco,
which still has its county hospital and still

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.020
has its almshouse, albeit now called a hospital.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.290
So the patients, as you can imagine, are the
bottom 0.1% of the population.

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.539
What I've found is that they were two standard
deviations from the mean.

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:38.880
Any mean.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.669
They were the tallest and the shortest, the
fattest and the thinnest, the nicest and the

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.560
meanest, of any patients I ever had.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.110
They had every disease, too.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:06:00.220
They taught me a tremendous amount about medicine
and health care, cure and caring, efficiency

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.400
and inefficiency.

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.449
The two months went by, and then a year or
two, and I really didn't notice that the years

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:14.000
had gone by or that I was learning a lot from
the patients until I got to my patient, Mrs.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:24.670
Todd. [pause] Ms. Todd was 35 years old.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:26.039
She had cancer.

00:06:26.039 --> 00:06:29.130
Her cancer was brain cancer.

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:33.919
What made it horrible was that it was just
behind her right eye, and it had grown, in

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:37.840
spite of surgery and radiation, right out
of her eye.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.880
The surgeons had removed the eye and sewn
the eyelid down over the cancer, but the cancer

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.129
was still growing.

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:51.129
Ms. Todd had never been beautiful, but what
with the radiation, which had caused her hair

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.630
to fall out, the steroids, which had caused
her face to balloon, and the sewn eyelid,

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.520
she was very hard to look at.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.330
Yet she was pleasant and quiet.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.020
She always smiled as I passed her by.

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.370
Eventually, we were on speaking terms, with
a quick "Hello" and "How are you?"

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.180
from me to her and from her to me.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:17.620
I got used to her deformity, although only
by blocking out, in some way, my experience

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.060
of her experience.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:25.469
One day, I finally braved my reluctance and
stopped by her bed, full stop.

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:27.259
We looked at each other.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:31.740
She at me: white coated and rushed, a bit
disheveled.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.879
I looked only at her left eye.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.669
"Is there anything I can do for you?"

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:38.630
I asked her after we talked a bit.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:41.560
"Yes," she replied, "there is.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.129
I really don't like the food they're giving
me.

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:48.110
It's all cut up and bland.

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:50.023
Do you think it could be changed?

00:07:50.023 --> 00:07:51.023
And another thing.

00:07:51.023 --> 00:07:52.023
Could you arrange for me to visit the eye
doctor?

00:07:52.023 --> 00:07:56.900
I need a new pair of glasses."

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.289
I was, and am to this day, floored by her
response.

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:05.460
I was, and am, awestruck by such equanimity.

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:11.400
She wanted, not euthanasia or a miraculous
cure, stronger pain medication, or a second

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.410
opinion, but different food, a pair of glasses.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.439
She said nothing about her terrible misfortune.

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:21.050
She was calm, matter-of-fact.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:23.830
Somehow, she'd accepted her fate.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:32.110
It was the small things, the little daily
things, that were important to her.

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:35.570
We did change her diet, and we did get her
new glasses.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:41.120
Not long after, she moved to another ward,
and there she died peacefully, 18 months later.

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.750
Ms. Todd capped my experience of those first
years of Laguna Honda.

00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:51.010
She summarized it and hinted at what I would
be learning later.

00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:56.829
Even when there's nothing to do for a patient,
no cancer to discover, no paradoxical pulse

00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:59.730
to take, there is still something to do.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:04.410
It doesn't have to be life saving, grandiose,
and heroic.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:09.340
It can be as simple as a pair of glasses or
a different diet.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.390
In fact, it usually is.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.961
[pause] [clattering]
I learned a tremendous amount from the patients

00:09:19.961 --> 00:09:21.690
at Laguna Honda.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:29.020
If I had to summarize what I learned in one
sentence, it would be that the practice of

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:33.529
medicine is a personal relationship between
doctor and patient.

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:37.329
And when it's personal, it works.

00:09:37.329 --> 00:09:42.870
The best way, the easiest way I can explain
what I mean is to tell you the story of Dr.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.710
Curtis and the case of the missing shoes.

00:09:47.710 --> 00:10:01.930
[pause] I learned a lot from Dr. Curtis, but
it was in the case of the missing shoes that

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:06.940
he taught me the most about care and caring,
time and inefficiency.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:12.720
On this particular day, I met him by accident
in the wide-windowed corridor that ran the

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.370
length of the hospital and connected all the
wards.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.889
He was in a hurry.

00:10:16.889 --> 00:10:19.170
"Where was he going?"

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.310
I asked.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:26.940
"Back to the rehabilitation ward," he said,
where he was covering for a few weeks.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.529
The rehabilitation ward was its own mini hospital
within Laguna Honda.

00:10:31.529 --> 00:10:36.370
It admitted the patients with the milder strokes
and the less traumatic head injuries, most

00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:41.220
of whom would recover and be discharged back
to their homes, if they had them.

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:46.650
Although its patients, too, were often without
friends, money, or health insurance, like

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.829
the admitting ward, it had its own physicians
to admit, examine, and discharge its patients.

00:10:52.829 --> 00:10:56.339
This month, Dr. Curtis was one of them.

00:10:56.339 --> 00:11:00.720
He'd just returned from outside the hospital,
he told me, and was heading back to a patient

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:07.660
who, having been rehabilitated after a stroke,
had been ready for discharge for months.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:13.370
Every day, when Dr. Curtis made his rounds,
checking on the 36 patients on the ward, this

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:18.400
patient was still there, still zipping around
in his wheelchair, still going to therapy.

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:25.490
Finally, Dr. Curtis said, "I asked him why,
since he was able to walk, he was still here.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.530
Why was he still in the wheelchair?

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:30.579
Why hadn't he been discharged?"

00:11:30.579 --> 00:11:32.680
"No shoes, doc.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.680
They ordered me special shoes, but they're
waiting for Medicaid to approve them."

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.790
"How long have they been waiting?"

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:41.790
Dr. Curtis asked.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:43.120
"Three months."

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:46.339
Dr. Curtis thought a bit.

00:11:46.339 --> 00:11:48.779
"What size shoe do you wear?"

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:49.779
"Size 9."

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:51.880
Dr. Curtis reflected for a while.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.310
He thought about his duties, his other patients,
the charts he had to dictate, the quality

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.910
assurance forms he had to fill out.

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:05.670
Then he left the hospital, got in his car,
and drove to Wal-Mart, where he bought a pair

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:10.019
of size 9 running shoes for $16.99.

00:12:10.019 --> 00:12:13.480
He'd just come back with the shoes and was
going over to the ward to put them on the

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.000
patient and write the discharge orders.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.940
"Was he planning to submit his receipt for
reimbursement?"

00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:19.940
I asked.

00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:20.940
He laughed.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:25.880
As I watched him hurry back to the rehabilitation
ward, I wondered.

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.630
Why had Dr. Curtis done this, and why hadn't
anyone else?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.320
It was a simple thing to do, but it never
would have occurred to me to do it.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:38.600
I would've been frustrated with the shoe delay,
of course, and I would have filled out a second

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.790
or even a third Medicaid form.

00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:46.240
I might even have written Medicaid, or braved
its phone tree to complain about the time

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.100
that pair of shoes was taking.

00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:53.410
But it would never have occurred to me to
go to Wal-Mart and buy the patient's shoes.

00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:58.339
I had too much to do, too many forms to fill
out, too many other patients to see.

00:12:58.339 --> 00:13:01.529
It would have meant crossing an inefficiency
boundary.

00:13:01.529 --> 00:13:07.170
And yet, Dr. Curtis got in his car without
much questioning and was hurrying back to

00:13:07.170 --> 00:13:12.540
the ward with the shoes to put them on the
patient himself.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.860
He reminded me of an aphorism I loved but
had never understood.

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:20.430
"The secret in the care of the patient is
in caring for the patient."

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:25.759
I'd always assumed that mean caring about
the patient, loving or at least liking the

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:30.990
patient, but when I saw Dr. Curtis rushing
off to put shoes on a patient he barely knew,

00:13:30.990 --> 00:13:33.600
I thought there must be more to it than that.

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:38.970
So I tracked down the quote and found it in
a talk by Dr. Francis Peabody to the graduating

00:13:38.970 --> 00:13:43.040
medical class of Harvard in 1927.

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:48.339
Turned out that Dr. Peabody didn't mean caring
about a patient, but caring for a patient,

00:13:48.339 --> 00:13:52.759
which he explained meant doing the little
things, the little personal things that nurses

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:58.279
usually do: adjusting a patient's bedclothes,
giving him sips of water.

00:13:58.279 --> 00:14:02.870
That took time, Dr. Peabody admitted, and
wasn't perhaps the most efficient way for

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:08.300
doctors to spend their time, but it was worth
it, he told his students, because that kind

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:13.440
of time costly caring was what created the
personal relationship between patient and

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.440
doctor.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:21.860
And that relationship was the secret of healing.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:39.519
[pause]
In the meantime-- [pause] In the meantime,

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:40.519
I'd started my Ph.

00:14:40.519 --> 00:14:42.010
D. in medical history.

00:14:42.010 --> 00:14:47.230
I was studying the medical writings of Hildegard
of Bingen.

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:50.139
Hildegard was a 12th century German nun.

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:58.310
She was also a visionary, a mystic, a composer,
and, as it turned out, a medical practitioner.

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.019
She'd written a book about medicine.

00:15:00.019 --> 00:15:01.720
It was fascinating.

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:07.630
There was not the "eye of newt, toe of frog"
medicine I expected from a medieval medical

00:15:07.630 --> 00:15:08.630
text.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:14.440
It was real medicine from real patients with
real diseases that I could recognize.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.920
But it was based on a completely different
idea of the body than our mechanical model.

00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.560
Hildegard's idea was that the body was more
like a plant than a machine.

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:29.589
And the doctor more like a gardener than a
mechanic.

00:15:29.589 --> 00:15:31.459
What's the difference?

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:36.470
The difference is that someone has to fix
a broken machine.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:44.810
[pause] But a plant can heal itself.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:52.330
[pause]
Hildegard called the power of a plant to heal

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:59.519
itself its viriditas, its greening power,
from the Latin "viridis", meaning "green."

00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:05.180
She thought that human beings also had viriditas,
a natural power of healing, and that the doctor,

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:10.740
therefore, should be more like a gardener
cultivating that viriditas, removing obstructions

00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:15.810
to it, nourishing it, than like a mechanic.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:21.190
I didn't really understand what Hildegard
meant by viriditas until my patient Terry

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:22.600
Becker.

00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:27.899
Terry Becker was one of my bad girls.

00:16:27.899 --> 00:16:32.350
Actually, the New York Times called her the
"worst girl" and I thought that was actually

00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:35.370
a good way to put it.

00:16:35.370 --> 00:16:40.440
She was homeless and lived on the street with
her boyfriend, Mike.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.110
She smoked and drank and used drugs.

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:47.269
One day, she woke up paralyzed from the neck
down.

00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:51.569
She went to the county hospital, and they
discovered that she had a rare viral disease

00:16:51.569 --> 00:16:58.000
called transverse myelitis, that has no treatment
but does tend to get better over time.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.260
They sent her over to Laguna Honda.

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.850
She was on rehabilitation, and she did pretty
well.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.340
She started to get better for about the first
two weeks.

00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:13.790
But then the first of the month rolled around,
when the homeless in San Francisco get paid,

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.100
get welfare cash.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:20.409
Mike, her cute boyfriend, showed up, and out
they went.

00:17:20.409 --> 00:17:22.490
She disappeared for about a year.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:27.870
Later, I found out that during that year,
she'd been seen in the emergency room at County

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:32.790
28 times, and had 3 long admissions to the
County.

00:17:32.790 --> 00:17:36.030
Each time, just as she was getting better,
going out on the streets.

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.910
During that time, she developed a bedsore.

00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:44.380
Mike also robbed her and beat her up.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:49.330
She went back and forth to the County getting
very expensive operations to cover the bedsore

00:17:49.330 --> 00:17:51.960
with a skin graft every time she went out.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:55.690
Finally, the bedsore was too big to graft.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:18:07.210
County didn't know what to do, and they sent
her over to Laguna Honda for treatment.

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:14.059
[pause] [clattering]
When I examined her, I was really quite shocked.

00:18:14.059 --> 00:18:16.120
She didn't look-- She looked pretty sick.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.460
She was only 37.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:19.520
She looked like she was in her 50s at least.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.480
It was the bedsore that really shocked me.

00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:24.700
It was the worst I'd ever seen.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:29.130
It was huge, enormous, and deep.

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:33.520
It went from the middle of her back all the
way down to her tail bone, and it spanned

00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.590
both of her sitz bones.

00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:40.900
The skin was completely gone, of course, but
so were the fat and the muscles that covered

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.530
the spine.

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:48.250
In their place was an unidentifiable mass
of decayed and decaying and infected tissue

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.690
from the failed skin grafts.

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:57.520
At the bottom of this wide, deep hole, I could
see bone: Terry's spine.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.620
Terry's bedsore was scary.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:01.679
She had no protection.

00:19:01.679 --> 00:19:06.900
Everything delicate and crucial in her body--
bones, kidneys, spinal cord-- was exposed

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.340
and vulnerable to an environment full of germs.

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:15.059
Giving antibiotics to try to prevent infection
wouldn't work because the bacteria would get

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:16.830
resistant to them.

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:21.179
The bedsore really was too big to graft, even
if the surgeons agreed.

00:19:21.179 --> 00:19:25.400
It would have to heal on its own, and that
would take years.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:30.240
In the meantime, what chance did Terry have
of not getting an overwhelming infection that

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.000
would kill her?

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.200
I walked back to our little doctors' office
and sat down at my rickety desk.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:42.030
I stared for quite a while at the wooden shelf
on which was Mrs. McCoy's robust plant, now

00:19:42.030 --> 00:19:44.169
grown all over the wall.

00:19:44.169 --> 00:19:49.290
The bedsore was a catastrophe, and possibly
the end of Miss Terry Becker.

00:19:49.290 --> 00:19:54.169
The second time with the patient, I thought
about Hildegard.

00:19:54.169 --> 00:19:57.090
I asked myself, "What would Hildegard do?

00:19:57.090 --> 00:20:01.760
How would she treat Terry Becker's huge and
open wound?"

00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:08.990
What she would do, I suddenly saw, was remove
obstructions to Terry's viriditas, because

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:14.360
if nothing was in its way, then viriditas
would heal her wound as surely as a plant

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.600
will grow green.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.340
"What was in its way?"

00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:18.840
I asked myself.

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:23.000
The massive dead tissue was in its way and
needed to be removed.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.820
Any pressure on Terry's body from wrinkled
bedclothes, to hard mattresses, was in its

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.279
way and had to be removed.

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:38.621
Dirt, unkemptness, stale clothes, unnecessary
medications, fear, depression, all were in

00:20:38.621 --> 00:20:39.621
its way.

00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:45.520
My first job, therefore, as gardener doctor
was not to make a brilliant diagnosis or give

00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:51.309
any magical medication, but remove obstructions
to Terry's own viriditas.

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:57.539
It was quite amazing how fast Hildegard's
prescription worked.

00:20:57.539 --> 00:21:02.210
Within a few weeks, I began to see signs of
healing deep within Terry's wound.

00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:04.590
There was no infection.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:08.850
Deep down, at the base of the wound, is it
my imagination?

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:15.840
There was a smooth and pink glistening which
was starting to cover and protect the spine.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:20.850
But then the first of the month rolled around,
and Mike showed up.

00:21:20.850 --> 00:21:26.250
He was still pretty cute, still wearing his
tight Levi's, still walking with a flirtatious

00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:28.289
though constrained strut.

00:21:28.289 --> 00:21:31.770
The nurses made him wait in the smoking room.

00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:37.100
Terry wheeled herself on her gurney, face
down, back covered, the whole length of the

00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:38.450
ward.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:41.100
Then she rolled into the smoking room.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:43.994
They were in there a long time.

00:21:43.994 --> 00:21:48.640
Then the door opened, and Mike came out and
left.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.100
Terry had thrown him out.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.059
She told him never to come back.

00:21:53.059 --> 00:21:58.230
Then she stopped smoking, so her appetite
improved and she gained weight.

00:21:58.230 --> 00:22:03.080
Without nicotine constricting her blood vessels,
the tiny new arteries and veins at the base

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:08.230
of her bedsore could absorb the vitamins and
protein she was eating, and the hole in her

00:22:08.230 --> 00:22:11.490
backside began to fill in.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:16.110
Since I did not check the bedsore daily, but
only once a week, its progress seemed as magical

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:21.590
to me as one of those time lapse movies they
showed us in school, where a plant grows from

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:25.539
a seed in a matter of minutes.

00:22:25.539 --> 00:22:28.180
Terry's wound began to look like a huge scab.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.990
The scab thickened until it was even with
the rest of the skin, and then just as petals

00:22:32.990 --> 00:22:37.970
push against the constriction of the bud and
open it, the scab flaked off and there was

00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:39.970
pink skin underneath.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:45.740
That awful crater filled in from bottom to
top and from side to side.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:46.740
It took a long time.

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.090
It took two and a half years.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:56.570
But we were in no hurry, and neither was she.

00:22:56.570 --> 00:23:01.480
[pause]
Terry changed the way I practiced medicine.

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.940
After that, I not only looked at patients
with the eye of the modern doctor, focusing

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:12.400
in on what was wrong with the patient and
how I could fix it, I also stepped back and

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.929
looked at the patient in the context of his
environment and asked myself, "Is there something

00:23:16.929 --> 00:23:19.720
I can do to encourage this patient's viriditas?

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:25.600
Is there something I can do to remove what's
in the way?"

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:32.500
What I found was that this kind of slow medicine
worked very well for patients with slow diseases,

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:38.440
diseases that were long in developing, chronic
diseases, for which medicine had no really

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440
good treatment.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.730
I began to think of it as slow medicine as
opposed to the fast medicine that I also use,

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:52.840
which works so well for fast diseases: heart
attacks, appendicitis, cancer, but doesn't

00:23:52.840 --> 00:24:00.740
work so well after the heart attack, the appendectomy,
the chemotherapy.

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:05.960
[pause]
Then, about halfway through my time at Laguna

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.520
Honda, things started to change.

00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:17.490
There was a big push to turn the old fashioned
hospital into a modern health care facility.

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:24.600
There was a lot of battles, politics, and
struggles, especially between the director

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:32.090
of public health, whom I call Dr. Stein in
the book, and the doctors, nurses, and administrators

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.320
of Laguna Honda.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.750
Finally, one day, Dr. Stein had had enough.

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:42.080
He replaced the medical director, the nursing
director, and the executive administrator

00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:45.090
all at once with his own picks.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:53.200
They were to come over to the hospital and
transform the hospital into a modern facility.

00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:57.399
The name of the new executive administrator,
I call Mr. Conley.

00:24:57.399 --> 00:25:02.120
This is what happened.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:10.840
[pause] Mr. Conley was a bluff, hearty fellow
with an energetic, gravely voice, red hair,

00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.299
and red beard.

00:25:12.299 --> 00:25:16.799
He reminded me of the youngish Henry VIII
around the time he fell in love with Anne

00:25:16.799 --> 00:25:17.799
Boleyn.

00:25:17.799 --> 00:25:21.980
He was, as they said in the Middle Ages, Dr.
Stein's man.

00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:26.279
His orders were to change Laguna Honda from
an old fashioned almshouse to a modern health

00:25:26.279 --> 00:25:29.179
care and rehabilitation facility.

00:25:29.179 --> 00:25:35.049
He had been warned by Dr. Stein about the
obstructions he would face: the balky doctors,

00:25:35.049 --> 00:25:39.370
the obstreperous nun, the ex-director of nursing.

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:40.970
Mr. Conley was prepared.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:46.440
But Mr. Conley, with the best will in the
world, eventually made a fatal mistake.

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:51.720
He stepped out of the administration wing
and met the patients of Laguna Honda.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.850
I don't know how it happened, but I suppose
it had to do with the crashing of our computers.

00:25:57.850 --> 00:26:04.480
Every computer in the hospital and everything
about them: email, printing, all the laboratory

00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.470
data, all the forms.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:09.920
The computers went down and stayed down for
months.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:15.549
It was fortunate that the hospital was as
big and sloppy as it was, because not everything

00:26:15.549 --> 00:26:17.630
was on those computers.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:19.610
Most of us still had our books.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.580
The telephones were still plugged into the
walls.

00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:27.940
We still had our wooden mailboxes, overhead
paging, and clocks.

00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:29.909
There was no email, however.

00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:36.060
So instead of sitting in his re-redecorated
administration wing and shooting out electronic

00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.130
missives, Mr. Conley had to scribble his messages
of pieces of paper, and when they were important,

00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:42.780
deliver them himself.

00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:47.900
Huffing and puffing, the whole long length
of the hospital, himself praying that the

00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:53.830
elevator would start and not stop midway,
himself praying.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:59.240
Passing the tattooed smokers in Harmony Park,
like the rest of us, Mr. Conley fell under

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:00.730
Laguna Honda's spell.

00:27:00.730 --> 00:27:03.840
He began to say "Hello" to the patients he
passed.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:05.830
He began to know some of them.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:10.020
He began to visit them in their rooms and
on the open wards.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:11.020
And he softened.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.440
He got a bit confused.

00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.270
Perhaps there were patients at Laguna Honda,
and not simply resident.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:22.610
Perhaps Laguna Honda was a hospital, and not
a health care and rehabilitation facility.

00:27:22.610 --> 00:27:27.860
So even after the computers were fixed, which
took four months, and I was surprised at how

00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:32.890
much less work I had while they were down,
even including telephoning the lab for my

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:39.870
results, Mr. Conley continued to step out
of the administration wing and visit the patients.

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:44.519
Not with Miss Lester's compressed mouth and
eagle eye, but still he sat on beds, he talked,

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:50.570
he listened, and he learned about the hospital
from the patients' point of view, which would

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:53.230
be fatal.

00:27:53.230 --> 00:27:55.820
Mr. Conley changed after that.

00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:06.299
Not so much his decisions, which came down
from above, [pause] [knocking sound] but the

00:28:06.299 --> 00:28:09.899
way he felt about his decisions, because he
knew the patients now.

00:28:09.899 --> 00:28:12.950
He knew how his decisions would affect them.

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:17.590
What I learned from that is that it wasn't
only medicine that had to be personal.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:23.880
Administration has to be personal, too.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:31.220
[pause]
Over the past 20 years, I've watched medicine--

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:38.820
the pendulum of health care swing from the
personal to the efficient, and I have been

00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:45.760
amazed by how inefficient that efficient health
care has turned out to be.

00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.059
Healthcare costs keep rising astronomically
every year.

00:28:49.059 --> 00:28:54.529
Patients, doctors, and even economists are
more and more frustrated.

00:28:54.529 --> 00:28:57.220
Nobody seems to know what to do.

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.830
So let me end with showing you what happened
when modern, efficient health care landed

00:29:02.830 --> 00:29:06.470
at Laguna Honda.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:14.159
[pause]
What I did is I put together a graph over

00:29:14.159 --> 00:29:18.510
the 20 years I was at Laguna Honda.

00:29:18.510 --> 00:29:24.159
As cost-cutting measures, the patients were
gradually whittled down by about 40%, from

00:29:24.159 --> 00:29:26.580
1178 to 780.

00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:34.519
The doctors were also whittled down, from
about 32 to 9, about by 80%.

00:29:34.519 --> 00:29:44.539
The clinical staff was whittled down by about
30%.

00:29:44.539 --> 00:29:47.809
But the budget kept rising.

00:29:47.809 --> 00:29:54.290
What's more, the total staff stayed the same.

00:29:54.290 --> 00:29:55.290
Why was that?

00:29:55.290 --> 00:30:01.799
We kept having more and more administration
and management.

00:30:01.799 --> 00:30:07.610
[pause] In fact, by the time I left, the day
I left I looked around and realized that there

00:30:07.610 --> 00:30:12.470
were more quality assurance managers at Laguna
Honda than there were doctors.

00:30:12.470 --> 00:30:14.929
That was pretty scary.

00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:17.420
What does all this new management do?

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:22.380
It's hard to know for sure, but the one thing
there are more of at Laguna Honda today than

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:29.519
when I started there is forms.

00:30:29.519 --> 00:30:33.350
When I first got to Laguna Honda, there were
two forms of one page each.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:38.930
The day before I left, I took out a random
chart, opened it up, and counted.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:46.700
There were 43 forms, and most of them were
three, five, ten pages long.

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:50.700
I made a rather complicated scribbled graph
of this, but I think it's worthwhile looking

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.800
at it.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.870
I don't have little pointers, so you just
have to follow me, but you can see the patients

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:59.269
in the blue in the middle are going down,
down, down, down.

00:30:59.269 --> 00:31:04.840
The doctors, the physicians, in the black,
going down, down, down.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:10.460
The budget, that blue line that just goes
up.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:15.570
And the forms, which is the red line, going
way up.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:24.540
I've actually pulled this out to, assuming
that the present trends continue, in 2024,

00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:30.220
if they continue, there will be no patients
at Laguna Honda, [laughter], two physicians,

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:37.370
1400 FTE and a budget of 280 million dollars.

00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:43.700
I think it's time for us to all work together
to give that pendulum of health care a nudge

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:53.190
backwards, towards the inefficient, the human,
and the personal.

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:58.529
Thank you very much.

00:31:58.529 --> 00:31:59.860
[applause]

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.250
&gt;&gt;male#1: I had a question about the bad girl
patient.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.470
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Yes.

00:32:06.470 --> 00:32:13.169
&gt;&gt;male#1: What exactly was it that helped
her to turn around her life and break free

00:32:13.169 --> 00:32:15.649
of her abusive, exploitive boyfriend?

00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:17.510
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:17.510 --> 00:32:21.330
&gt;&gt;male#1: Is it about the care she received,
or was it something that she just had reached

00:32:21.330 --> 00:32:26.630
a point where she knew it was either death
or completely transform her life?

00:32:26.630 --> 00:32:27.630
Any idea?

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.630
&gt;&gt;Sweet: It's a great question.

00:32:28.630 --> 00:32:29.630
Can everybody hear that?

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:30.630
Good.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:31.630
Okay, great.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:33.380
I think that's a beautiful question, actually,
to ask.

00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.110
I ask myself that a lot.

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:37.220
I think there are two things.

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:42.529
That last time, Terry was way at the end of
the ward, and she had a very special nursing

00:32:42.529 --> 00:32:44.950
assistant named Connie.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:47.440
I noticed that Connie's patients always got
better.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:50.870
It was just something about Connie.

00:32:50.870 --> 00:32:57.280
She was also kinda trapped because she was
on that gurney lying down, face down, for

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:58.280
weeks.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:01.440
I just think she had some kind of change of
heart.

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:04.990
It was really a very mysterious change of
heart, but that was her true healing.

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:09.100
In fact, the name of this chapter I called
the Miraculous Healing of Terry Becker.

00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:13.120
And that, what you put your finger on, is
exactly the miracle, that she made that decision.

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:19.409
I don't really know why, but I do know that
decision stayed made, and that once she was

00:33:19.409 --> 00:33:23.190
healed, and not only was she healed of her
bedsore, but by the time the bedsore was healed,

00:33:23.190 --> 00:33:24.269
everything else about her was healed.

00:33:24.269 --> 00:33:28.380
We'd found her family, which hadn't seen her
in 10 or 12 years.

00:33:28.380 --> 00:33:31.100
Her family wanted to have her back home with
them.

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:35.090
We had a patient gift fund at Laguna Honda,
so we could get the money together to send

00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:37.380
her back home.

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:38.519
She'd fattened up.

00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:47.440
She had a whole personality change, from irritable,
frustrated, and kinda mean, to kind and grateful.

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:49.100
She was like a completely different person.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.090
I know that she went back to her home and
stayed.

00:33:52.090 --> 00:33:54.100
She never went back on the streets.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:59.470
&gt;&gt;female #1: Going off from this last slide,
what do we do to make that happen?

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:08.370
&gt;&gt;Sweet: You know, I don't know quite the
answer to that, except I am getting so much

00:34:08.370 --> 00:34:13.050
attention for this book and these ideas.

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:15.680
I feel a little bit like the kid in The Emperor's
New Clothes.

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.790
I'm like, "But there are just no clothes here.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.270
I mean, come on, people.

00:34:19.270 --> 00:34:20.900
Like, medicine is personal?

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:24.690
Is that the most unbelievably smart thing
you've ever heard?

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.690
No!

00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:26.690
It's like, hello!

00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:30.150
So I'm getting this kind of reaction from
people.

00:34:30.150 --> 00:34:34.810
I think it's going to make a change, I almost
think just by thinking about this, recognizing

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:36.780
it.

00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:43.080
I think it's going to change anyway, because,
fortunately, we live in a capitalist country.

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:50.210
The fact is, not only is it-- It is in fact
more efficient, it saves money, when the doctor

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:56.470
has enough time to do a good job, get the
right diagnosis, take you off the medications

00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:57.790
you don't need.

00:34:57.790 --> 00:34:59.020
It saves money.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.010
I think once the capitalist health systems
realizes that it's cheaper to give doctors

00:35:04.010 --> 00:35:08.220
enough time to see patients, than it is to
whittle us down so that we just have to order

00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:13.250
a whole bunch of tests, it will change on
its own, I do believe.

00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:17.540
I just think there's kind of a will out there,
because the doctors, they'll love what I'm

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.900
saying here, and the patients, everybody.

00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:20.900
It's like a trip.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:25.930
&gt;&gt;male #2: I'm curious, did Terry have substance
issues, and was becoming sober [clears throat]

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:28.560
part of her recovery?

00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:29.880
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Absolutely.

00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:30.880
Absolutely.

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.800
But as you probably know, making that decision
to become sober.

00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:37.190
It really was--
When she went in that room, I can remember

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:40.360
right now, we were all just cringing.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.030
This had happened over and over again.

00:35:42.030 --> 00:35:45.810
We were just sure Mike and she would be rolling
out together.

00:35:45.810 --> 00:35:47.800
And when I saw-- It still gives me shivers.

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.660
When I saw Mike walk out of that-- The door
opened, he walks out, and he's by himself.

00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.770
And I remember him walking out the ward, we
had swinging doors, and he went through the

00:35:56.770 --> 00:35:58.460
doors and they swing shut.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:36:02.370
Then Terry rolled herself out of that room
back to her bed.

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:05.100
I was like, "Wow.

00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.180
Something happened there."

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.830
And then, of course, she did give up smoking.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:11.560
Once she gave up smoking, everything sort
of fell into place.

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.800
But why, I don't know.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:13.870
I don't really know.

00:36:13.870 --> 00:36:14.870
Yes.

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:18.980
&gt;&gt;male #3: With the popularity of your book,
have the decision makers at any of the medical

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.860
facilities reached out to you to learn how
they can reproduce the success of your experience?

00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:27.040
&gt;&gt;Sweet: I'm starting to get a few things
like that.

00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:30.350
[pause] But it's really just starting.

00:36:30.350 --> 00:36:33.220
I'm getting invitations to talk at different
places.

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:40.970
I've had a few, but I'm actually wanting to
get like Washington-level, because they have--

00:36:40.970 --> 00:36:41.970
huh?

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:43.710
&gt;&gt;male #3: inaudible

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:47.330
&gt;&gt;Sweet: [scoffs] I don't know, what about
the surgeon emperor or something.

00:36:47.330 --> 00:36:50.750
[laughter] Really powerful, you know?

00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:51.750
Yes.

00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:59.310
&gt;&gt;female #2: When I look at the medical profession
here, and actually, I should just add a footnote:

00:36:59.310 --> 00:37:02.210
my mother is actually currently in hospital.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.480
She's been in for a couple weeks, and probably
be in another week.

00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.890
But I feel very comfortable about that--

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:06.890
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Is she here, or in Italy?

00:37:06.890 --> 00:37:08.920
&gt;&gt;female #2: because she's not in America,
she's in Italy.

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.030
So I think she's going to be fine.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:16.480
[laughter] Well, I mean that seriously, because,
anyway.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.550
I mean, a lot of that's the talk you're giving
here.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:24.620
But one of the issues in America that I see
that's very different is everybody seems to

00:37:24.620 --> 00:37:32.900
want a quick pill fix-it thing, and if they
don't get a quick fix-it, they go to the legal

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:33.900
system.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:40.310
So one of the issues that I keep thinking
comes up around medicine, why it is the way

00:37:40.310 --> 00:37:47.330
it is in this country, is a lot around malpractice,
financial covering your ass, a bunch of stuff

00:37:47.330 --> 00:37:49.140
like that.

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:55.510
If you switch into being more inefficient
and human, the doctors are going to have to

00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:57.280
spend more time with their patients--

00:37:57.280 --> 00:37:58.280
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Absolutely.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.650
&gt;&gt;female #2: which means fewer patients.

00:38:01.650 --> 00:38:07.840
The whole equation in this country is in one
direction, and all of this-- Of course there's

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:14.460
that other piece, that all too many doctors
seem to be focused on the money, and not so

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:16.610
much on the caring.

00:38:16.610 --> 00:38:21.600
That's the stereotype that I see around.

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:29.590
All these pieces play in to an equation, as
you were describing, that's around money and

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.410
efficiency and this and that and forms.

00:38:33.410 --> 00:38:38.140
About covering your ass and covering your
pocketbook.

00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:40.320
I'd like to know more about, you know.

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.490
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Well, there are alternatives.

00:38:42.490 --> 00:38:45.110
To me, what we need in this country is an
experiment.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:48.050
In a way, Laguna Honda for me was an experiment.

00:38:48.050 --> 00:38:54.300
I have many, many cases where it's quite clear
that the Laguna Honda treatment-- Terry is

00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:55.560
a perfect example.

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:58.690
You can say, "Two and a half years in the
hospital, that's huge."

00:38:58.690 --> 00:39:02.440
But before she'd been in the hospital, she'd
been going back and forth, getting $100,000

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.440
operations.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.440
Back and forth.

00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:07.150
You could say, "Why treat her at all?" and
that's a different discussion.

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:11.600
But if we're going to take care of people,
then I was quite sure, from what I saw at

00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.870
Laguna Honda, that it was cheaper the Laguna
Honda way: to take the time.

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:17.920
I can give you a very practical example.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.920
Doctors are cheap.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.600
One of the things that's happened in this
country is the economists, when they were

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:27.110
trying to cut costs, they assumed doctors
were really expensive, so they've been de-skilling

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:29.340
doctoring onto nursing and nursing onto dadadadada.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.170
But in fact, doctors are quite cheap.

00:39:32.170 --> 00:39:34.730
I'll make $100 an hour.

00:39:34.730 --> 00:39:41.440
If I spend an hour with the patient, and that
hour allows me not to get an $1800 MRI, we're

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:44.450
way ahead of the game.

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:50.540
So I think one place to start is to just have
a model and show that, because if they show

00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.730
that Kaiser and HMOs, then everybody's going
to go, "Well, that's way cheap.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:57.170
We'll just give doctors back their time.

00:39:57.170 --> 00:39:58.580
That is cheaper."

00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:02.020
In terms of malpractice, of course there's
all that, and it's complicated, but I will

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:09.750
say this: that the malpractice, what they
say is that you do not actually get sued as

00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.290
a physician when you make a mistake.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:18.120
You get sued when the patient feels you didn't
care about them.

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:22.900
I have found that to be the case so far.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.450
I really have.

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:33.580
I think a lot of the malpractice issue is
a little bit of a covering.

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:34.810
I think we could do this.

00:40:34.810 --> 00:40:37.180
I think what's going to happen, it actually
is happening.

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:41.940
While I was writing this book-- This is actually
happening, because what's happening is doctors

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:47.190
are saying they can't take it any more and
they're doing this concierge whatever, boutique

00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:49.520
whatever kind of stupid name they've got for
it.

00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:54.000
This idea that it's more like CSA, like Community
Sponsored Agriculture, where you pay upfront,

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.550
you pay $100 a month or $150 a month and the
doctor gets his patients upfront.

00:40:58.550 --> 00:41:02.570
Instead of having to have 1000 patients to
pay his bills, he doesn't need any back office

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.370
because he gets paid upfront.

00:41:04.370 --> 00:41:08.431
He can have 250 patients, and with those 250
patients, he has all the time in the world

00:41:08.431 --> 00:41:09.850
to take care of them.

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:13.970
So that's actually an experiment that's a
hidden experiment that's going on right now.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:15.200
It's very interesting.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.250
The patients are thrilled, the doctors are
thrilled.

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.250
It's very interesting
Yes.

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.920
&gt;&gt;male #4: I really admit that I may not know
the facts correctly in this, but I understand

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.330
that there's something of a shortage of doctors.

00:41:25.330 --> 00:41:29.860
If doctors are inexpensive, then we should
have more of them.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:36.150
Is there something we should be doing to foster
more doctors being out there so we can have

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:37.290
more slow medicine?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:40.360
&gt;&gt;Sweet: Well, that's a complicated question.

00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:43.900
You don't know, and I don't really know, but
I think there's two pieces of it.

00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:47.110
The shortage is in what they like to call
primary care doctors.

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:48.920
I'm an internist.

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:50.740
I'm like the front person to take care of
you.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.120
And there seems to be a shortage.

00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120
Why?

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120
I don't want to do it.

00:41:55.120 --> 00:42:00.270
I don't want to get an unbelievably complicated
patient and have ten minutes to spend with

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.660
the patient, of which I spend three minutes
on the computer, seven minutes-- You can't

00:42:04.660 --> 00:42:05.660
do it.

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:09.360
So what you're having is doctors are not going
into primary care.

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.390
They're going into subspecialties.

00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:15.770
And if I had a kid who's going into medicine,
I would tell them, "Do not do what I did.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.640
You get yourself a nice little specialty where
you can do a good job, and you can have a

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:20.760
satisfying practice."

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:25.810
So I think there's plenty of doctors, but
they're not going into primary care.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:26.900
That's one thing.

00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:31.890
The second thing is my generation of doctors
are dropping out of the system like flies.

00:42:31.890 --> 00:42:32.890
We don't want to.

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:34.950
We love taking care of patients.

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:38.331
I think if we could take care of patients
the way we wanted, I think it's a little bit--

00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:44.120
That's my sense, is there's probably plenty
of doctors, but shifting who does what is

00:42:44.120 --> 00:42:45.580
more the issue than educating more docs.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:45.581
[applause]
