00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.722
Imagine you're at a football game

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:11.206
when this obnoxious guy sits next to you.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:11.906
He's loud,

00:00:11.906 --> 00:00:13.240
he spills his drink on you,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.995
and he makes fun of your team.

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:17.226
Days later, you're walking in the park

00:00:17.226 --> 00:00:19.823
when suddenly it starts to pour rain.

00:00:19.823 --> 00:00:21.130
Who should show up at your side

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.417
to offer you an umbrella?

00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:25.052
The same guy from the football game.

00:00:25.052 --> 00:00:26.489
Do you change your mind about him

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:28.213
based on this second encounter,

00:00:28.213 --> 00:00:29.709
or do you go with your first impression

00:00:29.709 --> 00:00:31.907
and write him off?

00:00:31.907 --> 00:00:34.298
Research in social psychology suggests

00:00:34.298 --> 00:00:37.112
that we're quick to form lasting impressions of others

00:00:37.112 --> 00:00:39.020
based on their behaviors.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.314
We manage to do this with little effort,

00:00:41.314 --> 00:00:43.310
inferring stable character traits

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.647
from a single behavior,

00:00:44.647 --> 00:00:45.481
like a harsh word

00:00:45.481 --> 00:00:46.974
or a clumsy step.

00:00:46.974 --> 00:00:48.733
Using our impressions as guides,

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.040
we can accurately predict

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.187
how people are going to behave in the future.

00:00:53.187 --> 00:00:54.075
Armed with the knowledge

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:55.462
the guy from the football game

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:57.293
was a jerk the first time you met him,

00:00:57.293 --> 00:00:59.793
you might expect more of the same down the road.

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:01.674
If so, you might choose to avoid him

00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:03.009
the next time you see him.

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:05.293
That said, we can change our impressions

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.337
in light of new information.

00:01:07.337 --> 00:01:09.873
Behavioral researchers have identified

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:12.210
consistent patterns that seem to guide

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.627
this process of impression updating.

00:01:14.627 --> 00:01:17.014
On one hand, learning very negative,

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.714
highly immoral information about someone

00:01:19.714 --> 00:01:21.435
typically has a stronger impact

00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:25.521
than learning very positive, highly moral information.

00:01:25.521 --> 00:01:27.796
So, unfortunately for our new friend

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:28.821
from the football game,

00:01:28.821 --> 00:01:30.243
his bad behavior at the game

00:01:30.243 --> 00:01:33.070
might outweigh his good behavior at the park.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.628
Research suggests that this bias occurs

00:01:35.628 --> 00:01:38.828
because immoral behaviors are more diagnostic,

00:01:38.828 --> 00:01:39.875
or revealing,

00:01:39.875 --> 00:01:42.043
of a person's true character.

00:01:42.043 --> 00:01:43.877
Okay, so by this logic,

00:01:43.877 --> 00:01:46.253
bad is always stronger than good

00:01:46.253 --> 00:01:47.923
when it comes to updating.

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:49.754
Well, not necessarily.

00:01:49.754 --> 00:01:51.882
Certain types of learning don't seem to lead

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.208
to this sort of negativity bias.

00:01:54.208 --> 00:01:57.431
When learning about another person's abilities and competencies,

00:01:57.431 --> 00:01:58.297
for instance,

00:01:58.297 --> 00:01:59.880
this bias flips.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.348
It's actually the positive information

00:02:01.348 --> 00:02:03.631
that gets weighted more heavily.

00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:05.128
Let's go back to that football game.

00:02:05.128 --> 00:02:06.624
If a player scores a goal,

00:02:06.624 --> 00:02:08.292
it ultimately has a stronger impact

00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:10.200
on your impression of their skills

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.959
than if they miss the net.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.902
The two sides of the updating story

00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:16.209
are ultimately quite consistent.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.310
Overall, behaviors that are perceived

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.542
as being less frequent are also the ones

00:02:20.542 --> 00:02:23.379
that people tend to weigh more heavily

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.627
when forming and updating impressions,

00:02:25.627 --> 00:02:26.914
highly immoral actions

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:29.293
and highly competent actions.

00:02:29.293 --> 00:02:32.004
So, what's happening at the level of the brain

00:02:32.004 --> 00:02:33.874
when we're updating our impressions?

00:02:33.874 --> 00:02:35.257
Using fMRI,

00:02:35.257 --> 00:02:37.878
or functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging,

00:02:37.878 --> 00:02:39.294
researchers have identified

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.478
an extended network of brain regions

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.213
that respond to new information

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:46.104
that's inconsistent with initial impressions.

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:48.296
These include areas typically associated

00:02:48.296 --> 00:02:49.574
with social cognition,

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:50.652
attention,

00:02:50.652 --> 00:02:52.465
and cognitive control.

00:02:52.465 --> 00:02:54.568
Moreover, when updating impressions

00:02:54.568 --> 00:02:56.570
based on people's behaviors,

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.709
activity in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.061
and the superior temporal sulcus

00:03:02.061 --> 00:03:03.494
correlates with perceptions

00:03:03.494 --> 00:03:07.879
of how frequently those behaviors occur in daily life.

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:10.290
In other words, the brain seems to be tracking

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.180
low-level, statistical properties of behavior

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.900
in order to make complex decisions

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.423
regarding other people's character.

00:03:17.423 --> 00:03:18.461
It needs to decide

00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.642
is this person's behavior typical

00:03:20.642 --> 00:03:22.483
or is it out of the ordinary?

00:03:22.483 --> 00:03:23.309
In the situation

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.312
with the obnoxious-football-fan-turned-good-samaritan,

00:03:26.312 --> 00:03:27.479
your brain says,

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:28.649
"Well, in my experience,

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.782
pretty much anyone would lend someone their umbrella,

00:03:31.782 --> 00:03:34.452
but the way this guy acted at the football game,

00:03:34.452 --> 00:03:36.297
that was unusual."

00:03:36.297 --> 00:03:39.247
And so, you decide to go with your first impression.

00:03:39.247 --> 00:03:40.985
There's a good moral in this data:

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:43.412
your brain, and by extension you,

00:03:43.412 --> 00:03:44.794
might care more about

00:03:44.794 --> 00:03:46.548
the very negative, immoral things

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:47.792
another person has done

00:03:47.792 --> 00:03:50.665
compared to the very positive, moral things,

00:03:50.665 --> 00:03:52.194
but it's a direct result

00:03:52.194 --> 00:03:55.693
of the comparative rarity of those bad behaviors.

00:03:55.693 --> 00:03:58.329
We're more used to people being basically good,

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.671
like taking time to help a stranger in need.

00:04:00.671 --> 00:04:04.200
In this context, bad might be stronger than good,

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.803
but only because good is more plentiful.

00:04:06.803 --> 00:04:08.828
Think about the last time you judged someone

00:04:08.828 --> 00:04:10.135
based on their behavior,

00:04:10.135 --> 00:04:11.843
especially a time when you really feel

00:04:11.843 --> 00:04:14.270
like you changed your mind about someone.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:15.720
Was the behavior that caused you

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:16.899
to update your impression

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.203
something you'd expect anyone to do,

00:04:19.203 --> 00:04:22.398
or was it something totally out of the ordinary?
