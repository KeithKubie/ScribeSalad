00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:08.600
 I'm a neutron, a developer of Erudite application, 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.920
 It is a mobile learning application that includes all the basic tools 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.600
 Including dictionaries, guide phrases and memorization cards 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
 It also works for Android Wear 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:21.400
 So users can learn English anywhere and anytime in their native language. 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.620
 English speakers can also learn 24 foreign languages ​​using Erudite. 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.360
 We are doing the job of removing language barriers 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.660
 Bridging the gap between different cultures. 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.320
 We took advantage of Google's suggestion 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.020
 We updated the application using a multi-dimensional design, 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.520
 Leading to an increased user rating for Google Play from 4.1 to 4.3. 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.760
 Erudite now has more than 1 million downloads worldwide 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.940
 Users in more than 200 countries. 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.880
 The app was selected under "Editors' Picks" and named "Public app" in 2015 on Google Play 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.180
 We got a great encouragement and pushed us forward 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.380
 I am Benji, product manager of Erudite Application. 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.080
 Keeping the user at the top of our priorities. 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.080
 So we prepared a report for the pilot release 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.260
 To collect data from various Android devices 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.520
 So as to minimize errors as much as possible before the official release of the application 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 This has helped us improve user satisfaction, 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.140
 The retention rate has increased to more than 60%. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.980
 We benefit from Firebase in tracking statistics, 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.640
 Crash reports, and other application-specific data 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.100
 Including location, age group, gender, device type, etc. 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.020
 We also benefit from Firebase in knowing users of different considerations 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.320
 And then we can make faster decisions and prepare a better application. 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.520
 In addition, we use Review Analysis 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.240
 To collect comments from users on Google Play 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.680
 We will benefit from the improved features of Erudite. 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.940
 This helps us respond to users directly and individually 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.240
 And then we can improve communication with users, 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.300
 And to know their specific requirements. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.260
 Google's Erudite app has benefited from reaching out to users from around the world. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.440
 I am Wenson, technical director of the Erudite application. 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.120
 The great support that Google provides adds to our confidence in a bright future. 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.900
 We seek to design a resource mobilization system 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.540
 In order to enable users to contribute educational materials to benefit some of them, 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.240
 And to provide them with a richer experience in learning languages.
