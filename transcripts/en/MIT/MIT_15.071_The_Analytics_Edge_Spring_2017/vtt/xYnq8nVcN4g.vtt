00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.830
Let us comment on the
results of the study.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.020
Robert Parker predicted that the
1986 Bordeaux wine is very good

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.030
to sometimes exceptional.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.220
On the other hand,
Ashenfelter said

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.240
that the 1986 Bordeaux
wine is mediocre.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.340
And made the prediction
that the 1989 Bordeaux would

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.570
be the wine of the century
and the 1990 Bordeaux

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.570
would be even better.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.340
In wine options, the
1989 Bordeaux wine

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.170
sold for more than
twice the price of 1986.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.820
And the 1990 Bordeaux wine
sold for even higher prices.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.690
Later, Ashenfelter predicted
that the 2000 and the 2003

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.130
Bordeaux wines would be great.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.340
And in this case,
Robert Parker stated

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.580
the 2000 is the greatest vintage
Bordeaux has ever produced,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.830
in agreement with Ashenfelter.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.390
So what is the analytics
edge in this case?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.690
What we have developed is
a linear regression model,

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.460
a simple but rather
powerful model

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.350
for predicting quality of wines.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.180
It only used few
variables and we

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.789
have seen that it predicted
wine prices quite well.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:27.110
In fact, in many
cases it outperformed

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.060
wine expert's opinions.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.710
And what is impressive, in
this first introductory lecture

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.490
to linear regression, is that
an analytics approach that

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.800
uses data to build a model
that improves decision making

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.960
is effective in a traditionally
qualitative problem.
