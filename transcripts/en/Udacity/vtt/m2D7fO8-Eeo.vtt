00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.236
Now let's start filling out our ANOVA table. Calculate the sum of squares for

00:00:04.236 --> 00:00:09.400
between group variablity. Since the sample sizes are different, we have to

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.275
multiply each sample size by the squared deviation of each group mean from the

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:21.556
grand mean. After we mulitply the sample size by the squared deviation, then we

00:00:21.556 --> 00:00:23.620
sum them up.
