00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:04.231
SAL: I'm here with John Resig, our resident Javascript

00:00:04.281 --> 00:00:06.474
and all-things-hardcore guru.

00:00:06.474 --> 00:00:07.988
JOHN RESIG: [LAUGHS] Thanks, Sal.

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:10.659
And also the architect behind

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.430
what we're looking at right now.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:13.329
What is this?

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.232
JOHN: Yeah. this is really exciting.

00:00:15.232 --> 00:00:17.590
This is the new Khan Academy

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.934
computer science content.

00:00:19.934 --> 00:00:22.881
We've been working on this now for a little while.

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:25.907
and I'm just really excited to get this out now.

00:00:25.907 --> 00:00:27.468
SAL: And so, this is a page that we have.

00:00:27.468 --> 00:00:28.673
I see a bunch of links right here.

00:00:28.673 --> 00:00:30.283
There's an introductory video.

00:00:30.283 --> 00:00:32.306
So, what we are doing right now isn't the introductory video.

00:00:32.306 --> 00:00:33.143
It's the launch video.

00:00:33.143 --> 00:00:33.643
JOHN: Yes.

00:00:33.643 --> 00:00:34.793
There is another introductory video

00:00:34.793 --> 00:00:36.146
that walks through all of the stuff.

00:00:36.146 --> 00:00:39.823
but let's talk a little bit about what this computer science is.

00:00:39.823 --> 00:00:42.770
So, fundamentally you've created a kind of a neat environment.

00:00:44.186 --> 00:00:45.719
Here's some of the example programs

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.207
that people have done already on this platform that you've made.

00:00:50.207 --> 00:00:52.213
So, here's some of the getting started ones.

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:53.496
Let’s play with—

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:55.291
So this is the most basic one, Winston.

00:00:55.291 --> 00:00:56.498
JOHN: Yeah, yeah.

00:00:56.498 --> 00:00:59.460
You’ve got some ellipses—[INDISTINCT]

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.271
SAL: And it’s an environment where you have, right over here—

00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:03.000
You have your coding pane on the left.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.687
And then you have a canvas to draw [the results].

00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:06.145
So it’s immediately visual.

00:01:06.145 --> 00:01:07.771
So this is something that’s pretty basic,

00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:08.981
even for an early programmer.

00:01:08.981 --> 00:01:12.629
And, what I find very exciting is some of this action—

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:14.346
that you can change things in real time.

00:01:14.346 --> 00:01:14.937
JOHN: Yeah.

00:01:14.937 --> 00:01:17.351
SAL: So—And there’s tutorials that go into more depth.

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:19.594
I can make Winston closer to my complexion.

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:20.431
JOHN: [LAUGHS]

00:01:20.431 --> 00:01:22.924
SAL: [LAUGHS] There you go

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:24.190
And we can change things in real time

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.787
So, even for a beginning programmer,

00:01:25.787 --> 00:01:28.088
they can start to play around with things.

00:01:28.088 --> 00:01:29.423
But obviously this is actually—

00:01:29.423 --> 00:01:33.969
What’s surprising is it’s a fairly powerful environment.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.160
JOHN: Yeah. Being able to have that responsiveness,

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.884
I feel like it allows you to just, kind of, better understand

00:01:39.884 --> 00:01:42.750
how things interact with each other,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.544
at a pretty fundamental level.

00:01:44.544 --> 00:01:45.970
SAL: Yeah. We have things like this,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.397
which is a little bit more involved.

00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:49.996
And we can change, we can change in real time,

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:52.707
some of the core variables right over here.

00:01:52.707 --> 00:01:55.461
So, [in] the initial spiral configuration—

00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:57.005
Well, let’s see what happens if we change it a little bit.

00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:59.144
We can see how it immediately changes everything

00:01:59.144 --> 00:01:59.983
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:01:59.983 --> 00:02:00.914
SAL: Maximum radius—

00:02:00.914 --> 00:02:02.627
What is this? How do you know what that does?

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:04.730
It does something.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:05.891
JOHN: It seems to get larger—

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:08.369
SAL: Oh yeah. It’s the radius of the circle,

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.737
Number of points in spiral itself.

00:02:11.737 --> 00:02:12.965
We can reduce it.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:14.268
JOHN: Looks like you're getting less and less—thinner.

00:02:14.268 --> 00:02:16.064
SAL: Yeah, we get thinner—thicker.

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:18.260
Yeah, so this is fascinating.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.772
JOHN: Yeah.

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.006
SAL: There’s all of these—

00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.841
Leave this page— [Sal reading the prompt on the screen.]

00:02:21.841 --> 00:02:23.916
And so, there is a ton of examples

00:02:23.916 --> 00:02:24.860
of what people have already done

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.223
all the way to this expert level. You have—

00:02:27.223 --> 00:02:28.080
This is a—

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.547
Ben Kamens wrote this [??].

00:02:29.547 --> 00:02:31.356
It’s literally a bird-flocking simulator.

00:02:31.356 --> 00:02:31.856
JOHN: Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:31.856 --> 00:02:32.941
SAL: But you can actually—

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:34.052
(Maybe this is less realistic.)

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:34.982
—hit the birds with rocks.

00:02:34.982 --> 00:02:37.563
JOHN: Yes. [LAUGHING] SAL: [INDISTINCT]

00:02:37.563 --> 00:02:38.722
But this was all done—

00:02:38.722 --> 00:02:41.089
I mean, what’s neat is this was done all in this environment

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:43.052
It’s all Javascript right over here.

00:02:43.052 --> 00:02:45.717
And anyone can go and look at these — and change them.

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:46.217
JOHN: Yeah.

00:02:46.217 --> 00:02:47.264
And then you can save it as your [own].

00:02:47.264 --> 00:02:48.749
You can “save as,” and it will save it,

00:02:48.757 --> 00:02:52.154
actually, in your profile.

00:02:52.154 --> 00:02:53.578
JOHN: Yeah. The big thing we want to do is

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:56.470
we want everyone to be able to see the code

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.295
and the thing that’s running—simultaneously.

00:02:59.295 --> 00:02:59.932
SAL: Yeah.

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:03.675
JOHN: And you should always feel willing and excited

00:03:03.675 --> 00:03:06.895
to change what’s there and make it your own.

00:03:06.895 --> 00:03:09.960
And so, we want to really heavily encourage

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.245
exploration and experimentation.

00:03:12.245 --> 00:03:16.033
And I think this platform is going to do that.

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:17.745
SAL: Yeah, this is neat.

00:03:17.745 --> 00:03:18.787
And you can collect the stuff.

00:03:18.787 --> 00:03:20.507
And so, if you go to your profile,

00:03:20.507 --> 00:03:21.649
it shows up there,

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.258
and then you can share it with other people, too.

00:03:23.258 --> 00:03:23.758
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:03:23.758 --> 00:03:25.140
SAL: So these are the things that I’ve been working on.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.797
I still have a little work left to do.

00:03:26.797 --> 00:03:29.894
[INDISTINCT] I wanted to do an Ulam spiral.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:31.206
I can actually show the current version of it.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:31.706
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:33.822
I’[ve] — made a little video on it, too.

00:03:33.822 --> 00:03:36.310
But yes, you just plot the prime numbers, things like that.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.810
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.249
SAL: Let’s see. How do we get here?

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.687
So, regardless—

00:03:39.687 --> 00:03:42.004
So, you go to Watch—

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:43.025
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:43.525
SAL: —Computer Science

00:03:43.525 --> 00:03:44.025
JOHN: Yep.

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:45.147
SAL: —and then you just click there.

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:47.464
And it takes you to that main “Computer Science” page.

00:03:47.464 --> 00:03:47.964
JOHN: Yep.

00:03:47.964 --> 00:03:48.953
SAL: And what if—

00:03:48.953 --> 00:03:50.455
So, we just looked at a bunch of examples.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:51.254
And obviously, people can look at

00:03:51.254 --> 00:03:52.668
the code for those examples.

00:03:52.668 --> 00:03:53.553
They can tweak it.

00:03:53.553 --> 00:03:55.082
They can save their own versions,

00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:57.481
and maybe create derivative versions of them.

00:03:57.481 --> 00:03:59.246
What if someone’s a complete beginner?

00:03:59.246 --> 00:03:59.787
JOHN: Mmm hmm.

00:03:59.787 --> 00:04:00.979
SAL: What should they do?

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:03.902
JOHN: So, I mean, probably the best way to go about it is

00:04:03.902 --> 00:04:06.204
to look at some things

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:08.198
that you think are kind of are interesting—

00:04:08.198 --> 00:04:13.046
like looking at some of the introductory explorations.

00:04:13.861 --> 00:04:15.568
Some of these programs here,

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:19.300
where it’s just basic drawing, for example.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.438
If you never programmed before,

00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:22.016
this is a great way to get started.

00:04:22.016 --> 00:04:24.455
Start to look at what is being done there

00:04:24.455 --> 00:04:30.142
and see if you can’t kind of intuitively know how

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:33.497
those function calls work.

00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:35.901
But even so, we have a whole bunch of tutorials.

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:41.143
So if you go up to the drawing tutorials there—

00:04:41.143 --> 00:04:42.668
We have a number of tutorials—

00:04:42.668 --> 00:04:44.371
We have a few tutorials on drawing,

00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:46.551
along with some of these programs

00:04:46.551 --> 00:04:48.208
that you can learn drawing from.

00:04:48.208 --> 00:04:50.853
Then, if you go up to—

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:54.816
If you want to learn some of the basics of programming,

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:57.605
as well, you can view the programming basics.

00:04:57.605 --> 00:05:00.501
And we go even into more depth

00:05:00.501 --> 00:05:04.514
about some of these topics

00:05:04.514 --> 00:05:05.855
that you might want to understand better.

00:05:05.855 --> 00:05:08.078
SAL: And they also have an audio component.

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:08.578
JOHN: Yes.

00:05:08.578 --> 00:05:11.210
SAL: Our now soon-to-be-famous intern,

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.568
Jessica, recorded many of these.

00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:13.110
JOHN: Yes. [LAUGHS]

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.283
SAL: But if you press play here,

00:05:14.283 --> 00:05:17.292
you’ll actually have here talking through what she’s doing here.

00:05:17.292 --> 00:05:18.493
And she’ll change the code in the canvas as she speaks

00:05:18.497 --> 00:05:18.997
JOHN: Yeah.

00:05:18.997 --> 00:05:20.718
SAL: And then, you can interact with that code.

00:05:20.718 --> 00:05:21.218
JOHN: Yeah.

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:22.294
SAL: Which is pretty neat—

00:05:22.294 --> 00:05:22.794
JOHN: Yeah.

00:05:22.794 --> 00:05:23.294
—almost magical,

00:05:23.294 --> 00:05:23.997
JOHN: [LAUGHS]

00:05:23.997 --> 00:05:24.970
in my opinion

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.903
And one thing that I’ve found really valuable,

00:05:26.903 --> 00:05:29.339
even for myself is to—

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:31.037
It’s sometimes fun to tweak other people’s code.

00:05:31.037 --> 00:05:32.383
But once you feel comfortable,

00:05:32.383 --> 00:05:33.898
to actually just look at what they did,

00:05:33.898 --> 00:05:35.306
and try to build ityourself—from scratch.

00:05:35.306 --> 00:05:37.863
Because that’s really how you really learn to program,

00:05:37.863 --> 00:05:40.676
is get inspired, see what’s possible,

00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:42.177
and then try to build it yourself.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.196
And if you get really stuck,

00:05:43.196 --> 00:05:45.854
then you see how other people have implemented things.

00:05:45.854 --> 00:05:48.161
And yeah—so this is really exciting.

00:05:48.161 --> 00:05:49.523
Did we miss anything?

00:05:49.523 --> 00:05:50.254
JOHN: No.

00:05:50.254 --> 00:05:51.661
I mean, yeah, this is the big thing.

00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:54.777
I think the big thing we want to encourage here is,

00:05:54.777 --> 00:05:57.966
we want you to make your own things;

00:05:57.966 --> 00:06:00.553
not only building off of what we have,

00:06:00.553 --> 00:06:03.034
but create something original.

00:06:03.034 --> 00:06:06.089
You can take components from what we’ve written,

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:07.934
or just write stuff that’s completely new.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:11.557
Mercury Subspace, there, is a pretty awesome one.

00:06:11.557 --> 00:06:14.469
That one, I think people will get a big kick out of that one.

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:16.107
SAL: And so this whole game was written right here.

00:06:16.107 --> 00:06:18.050
JOHN: Yeah. Yep.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:20.922
That was done by David, one of our interns.

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:22.484
SAL: Oh, this is a real game.

00:06:22.484 --> 00:06:23.768
JOHN: Yeah. [LAUGHS]

00:06:23.768 --> 00:06:24.460
SAL: This is—

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.518
Yeah, David kind of overdoes things sometimes.

00:06:26.518 --> 00:06:27.018
JOHN: [LAUGHS]

00:06:27.018 --> 00:06:27.903
This is pretty good.

00:06:27.903 --> 00:06:28.676
JOHN: [LAUGHS]

00:06:28.676 --> 00:06:29.176
SAL: This is—

00:06:29.176 --> 00:06:30.996
Oh, oh. Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:30.996 --> 00:06:31.766
And this is all written there.

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:33.319
And someone can change—

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.369
How do I pause it?

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:37.069
JOHN: Just click over right inside of it.

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:37.957
SAL: Oh, Okay.

00:06:37.957 --> 00:06:38.702
JOHN: So like, for example there,

00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:40.186
you got your max_Health.

00:06:40.186 --> 00:06:42.237
So why don’t you try changing max_Health.

00:06:42.237 --> 00:06:44.309
And look at the hearts in the display up there.

00:06:44.309 --> 00:06:46.229
SAL: So if I change my max_Health to 10—

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:46.829
JOHN: There you go.

00:06:46.829 --> 00:06:47.891
SAL: then, all of a sudden, we have more hearts here.

00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:48.849
JOHN: Yep. [LAUGHS]

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:49.568
SAL: And this is fun.

00:06:49.568 --> 00:06:50.814
I mean, even a very beginner

00:06:50.814 --> 00:06:53.197
could start changing a fairly sophisticated program.

00:06:53.197 --> 00:06:53.697
JOHN: Yeah.

00:06:53.697 --> 00:06:55.534
SAL: You can change the images and things like that.

00:06:55.534 --> 00:06:56.446
JOHN: Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

00:06:56.446 --> 00:06:57.196
Yeah. Why don’t you go down—

00:06:57.196 --> 00:06:58.235
Scroll down a little bit.

00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:01.330
So you got your guy there in a little beetle there.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.563
SAL: Mmm Hmm. Yeah.

00:07:02.563 --> 00:07:03.633
JOHN: There you go.

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:04.871
So there’s one, then sub—

00:07:04.871 --> 00:07:07.229
The second one down: “Beetle ship.”

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.052
SAL: Beetle ship.

00:07:08.052 --> 00:07:10.070
JOHN: And why don’t you click—

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.932
and then scroll down over there a little bit.

00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:13.893
SAL: Say, Spunky Sam?

00:07:13.893 --> 00:07:14.922
JOHN: Yeah, go ahead.

00:07:14.922 --> 00:07:15.921
JOHN: So, why don’t you click that.

00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:16.421
SAL: Spunky Sam.

00:07:16.424 --> 00:07:18.556
JOHN: And so, you can see that. Look at, now—

00:07:18.556 --> 00:07:20.526
SAL: Oh. So now, the ship is Spunky Sam—

00:07:20.526 --> 00:07:21.526
JOHN: Yeah. Now you’re—

00:07:21.526 --> 00:07:22.772
SAL: shooting. SAL: Very cool!

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:23.620
JOHN: [LAUGHS]

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:24.442
SAL: Very cool!

00:07:24.442 --> 00:07:27.233
JOHN: So, I mean, I think this is sort of—

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.102
One of the things that we really wanted to do is

00:07:29.102 --> 00:07:31.642
we really wanted to make it powerful—

00:07:31.642 --> 00:07:33.790
It’s simple enough that anyone can

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:36.928
really get in and start to play around.

00:07:36.928 --> 00:07:40.368
So, I think one of the big things here is that

00:07:40.368 --> 00:07:41.794
we want you to make your own things.

00:07:41.794 --> 00:07:43.261
And then down below,

00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:45.998
you see that there is this discussion area,

00:07:45.998 --> 00:07:49.092
where you can ask questions and comment on things.

00:07:49.092 --> 00:07:51.553
And this is a big thing.

00:07:51.553 --> 00:07:55.335
I think you’re going to find this to be a really valuable way

00:07:55.335 --> 00:08:01.880
to get feedback, and to be able to talk with other people,

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.362
and get a better understanding about how things work.

00:08:04.362 --> 00:08:05.205
SAL: And actually become a better—

00:08:05.205 --> 00:08:06.377
I mean, one thing I’ve found

00:08:06.377 --> 00:08:07.959
is—just writing a couple of these tutorials—

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:09.582
getting feedback from you and other people has,

00:08:09.582 --> 00:08:10.431
I think, made me better.

00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.346
Because there’s little silly things that I kept doing

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.074
And now, all of a sudden, other people can look at it—

00:08:14.074 --> 00:08:16.324
find other interesting ways of doing it. or even asking [others]—

00:08:16.324 --> 00:08:18.047
And you can ask the author questions

00:08:18.047 --> 00:08:19.596
about how would they have done something.

00:08:19.596 --> 00:08:22.179
So, it really creates a community of learners here.

00:08:22.179 --> 00:08:23.663
JOHN: Yeah. No, absolutely.

00:08:23.663 --> 00:08:24.853
SAL: This is exciting.

00:08:24.853 --> 00:08:26.847
I already have two or three projects that—

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:28.813
I’m not getting much things done right now.

00:08:28.813 --> 00:08:32.630
JOHN: [LAUGHS] Great. I— Yeah, I love it too.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.155
I’ve been having a blast playing around with it.
