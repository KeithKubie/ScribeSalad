00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.850
First question we sort to have to
ask ourselves is how do we know

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.600
that a certain system that
claims to be a TCB or

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.620
Trusted Computing Base is actually,
can actually be trusted?

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.978
So trusted is actually not
the only set of qualified we use.

00:00:15.978 --> 00:00:19.608
We call systems secure systems, trusted,

00:00:19.608 --> 00:00:25.020
I've been using this word, but
also high assurance systems.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.488
So, security you can think of this
as a binary property in some sense,

00:00:29.488 --> 00:00:32.822
either something is secure,
or it's not secure and

00:00:32.822 --> 00:00:36.713
something can go wrong and
while the security requirement.

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:41.579
Trusted is typically sort of higher
level of confidence that you

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.714
have that it's going to do the right
thing, what it is expected to do,

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:53.070
this level of trustworthiness, trusted
our reliance on it and things like that.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.360
High assurance, basically,
is a similar sort of idea.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.650
It does what it's supposed to do
with a very high level of assurance.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.390
I should say that the hardware that we
have, you need some place to stand on.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.110
Hardware is obviously something
that we're going to trust, and

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.057
software that has direct
access to the hardware,

00:01:13.057 --> 00:01:17.150
which makes up your operating system,
the trusted computing base.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.892
We have to trust it and anything else
that will be able to make claims about

00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:26.478
the level of trust that we have in the
system is going to depend on the trust

00:01:26.478 --> 00:01:30.253
that we have in this underlying
trusted computing base.

00:01:30.253 --> 00:01:35.196
So enforcement of a security policy
because we implement access control in

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:38.098
a certain way, or
isolation of processes,

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.327
isolation of untrusted
code from trusted code.

00:01:41.327 --> 00:01:44.887
All that is going to rely on this
level of trust that we have or

00:01:44.887 --> 00:01:49.708
the level of assurance that we have,
that the trusted computing base would do

00:01:49.708 --> 00:01:53.430
what it supposed to do, and
nothing more and nothing less.
