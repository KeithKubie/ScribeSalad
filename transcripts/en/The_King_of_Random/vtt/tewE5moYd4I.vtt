00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
Hey what's up guys. Grant Thompson. I'm back

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.480
with Ritchie and Jake. They are the crew from

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.830
the SonicDad team. I will put a link in

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:05.910
the description so you can check out

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.379
their videos. They got some pretty cool

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.660
stuff. These guys invented a mini

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.910
marshmallow cannon that we upgraded to

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.099
one of these giant alcohol powered

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.970
rocket launcher. So a couple of weeks ago we

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.980
took this mini marshmallow cannon and we've

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.779
doubled the size into this monstrosity

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.640
here. These things turned out a lot more

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.500
powerful than we expected and we ask you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.789
what kind of things you want us to shoot

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.890
out of them and Blazing Inferno left the

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.390
comment asking us to make some kind of

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.309
exploding ammunition so I got together with

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.050
this guy Ritchie and we spent yesterday

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.930
packing 30 or 40 of these many missiles

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.910
These little shells are designed to shoot out

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.190
of the alcohol cannon. They have a pistol primer

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.320
to ignite the powder charge inside. At

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.969
this stage, it's is in the safe condition

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.520
until I add this little pin which is

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.530
what is designed to hit the primer. Now

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.180
it's armed and ready to go

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.970
warhead is active haha

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.710
with the nail inside once these things

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.780
are shot. It will orient itself, nose

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.370
first and when it makes impact with the hard

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.260
surface it's going to blow up or at

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.070
least that's the idea. Wow, it was a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.060
little more powerful than i was

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.100
expecting and I saw the tail flied all the way up to here

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.310
way up to here. Yeah, my ears're ringing. Hahahaha

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.950
that's awesome check this out

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.480
so you can see all the different layers that

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.610
Ritchie 3d printed here to give it some

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.770
stability it looks like it just blasted

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.780
the two apart so that's probably because

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.150
of my hot gluing job if i did a little better job we

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.560
might've got this whole thing to explode but it's

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.610
still pretty loud

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.110
very impressive I think we got some

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.200
ammunition to work with so let's load them up and fire them up

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.410
I should've probably been wearing my glasses

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.280
for that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.500
let's go shoot some missiles now that we

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.880
know these things work we need a cool

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.320
target to shoot at some stuff by the

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.970
supercenter and picked up some kitty

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.770
litter as well as a colorful donkey

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.280
pinata let's go have some fun

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.910
hopefully that just makes it a little

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.390
more stable

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.970
we named our pinata Jack one of your

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.630
baby powder around so let's pump the sink

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:09.229
ready

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.540
he oh he oh this is where it gets real

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.860
You call it Ritchie. Two one fire wow haha oh my lifted

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:32.630
off the rock. Check this out check this out. It's

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.800
actually on fire

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.300
it's smoking and you can actually feel

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.950
like layers of paper burning away

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.720
they're going to go out huh burned my

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.510
finger right here is definitely one to

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.760
get back we had one in fact it's not

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.290
that in mind I feel like I was a little

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.450
high but we had a couple of good shots

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.400
down here and definitely somebody slips

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.290
right here you know what let's load up

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.640
and hit him again before he burns to the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.080
ground is ready

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:05.560
it's a really hard shot to hit that pinata

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.420
it is wedged in there this thing smoking at

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.890
the top there's a chance he could blow

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.200
up but it's active kitty litter that is

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.730
crazy

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.920
oh he's bleeding, he is bleeding kitty litter

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.900
all that stuff that loaded with more

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.240
missile ok i got you one more that was

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.640
awesome

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:40.360
So update guys we are down to our last few

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.890
rounds so we started these things as

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:42.670
best we can

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.200
we're gonna take one final shot and see

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.280
what kind of damage we can do at the end of the day.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.000
You guys ready? READY!

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.580
FIRE!

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.500
That was the money shot! Right there.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.120
I told you were going down.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.920
Perfect! Let's go take a look. Look at this

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.260
look up inside the neck here we've actually

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.670
got a warhead gone on that is why we

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.980
always check after we shot because we

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.980
have a live warhead in there and I bet

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.810
we still have a live warhead buried in

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.880
here as well we found one that didn't go

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.470
off them to get a handbomb it against that

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.160
wall

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.990
oh yeah that was is the stuff. That was amazing

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.960
I'm really glad we did this today there

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.080
you have it guys looks like are

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.000
exploding missile darks work after all

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.130

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.560
link in the description for their mini

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.940
marshmallow cannon you could build a

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.470
smaller version of these and have some

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.150
