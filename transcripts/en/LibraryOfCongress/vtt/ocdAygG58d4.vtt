00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.270
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Welcome,
welcome to the Library of Congress.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.040
I'm really very happy to see
you all here for what promises

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.150
to be a very exciting program.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.190
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
chief of the African

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.120
and Middle Eastern Division
here at the Library.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.180
And I make a little
ad for our division.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.500
Our division is made up of
three sections, the African,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.910
the Near Eastern, and
the Hebraic Sections.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.870
We're responsible for materials
from 78 countries in the Near East,

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.340
Central Asia, the Caucusus as well

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.160
as from the entire
continent of Africa.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.340
We also serve these
materials to patrons here

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.900
in our reading room
and around the Library.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.190
And we organize programs, exhibits,
conferences and other activities

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.830
that highlight these collections.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.800
And that inform our
patrons about the countries

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.710
and cultures these
publications come from.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.010
The African Section has been
partnering for the past five years

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.590
on a special series entitled
"Conversations with African Poets

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.670
and Writers" and has been
partnering with the Poetry

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.360
and Literature Center at the
Library and the Africa Society

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.780
of the National Summit on Africa.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.890
So we were delighted to meet
with Kwame Dawes, founding member

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.380
of the African Poetry Book Fund
and editor of the Prairie Schooner,

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.080
a couple of months ago over
dinner and we began discussing

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.800
and planning this very special
event today on African poetry

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.220
which fitted right in with
what we had been doing

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.820
for the past five years.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.780
So I very much hope that this
program is only the first,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.560
on the beginning of
many programs to come

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.290
that we will all be doing together.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.510
So now, I would like to
recognize Professor Kwame Dawes

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.950
and to thank him for bringing
the African Poetry Book Fund

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.430
to the Library.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.860
I would also like to thank
all those who have made this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.990
and all the other programs
in the series possible.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.910
Of course, Rob Casper, the dynamo,
the head of the Poetry Center

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.080
and Anya Creightney, the partner
in this endeavor who has worked

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.180
so very hard on the Library side
to put the program together.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.250 position:56%
As well as our long-term partners in
the Conversations with African Poets

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.820
and Writers, the President of the
Africa Society, Patricia Baine,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.090
and the Chairperson
of the Africa Society,

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.680 position:56%
Ambassador Pamela Bridgewater --
who unfortunately due to trains and,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.180
you know how they work,
has not been able to --

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.510
will not be able to join us.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.990
I would also recognize -- I would
also like to recognize my own team,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.210
Dr. Angel Batiste, Specialist
for West Africa, Marieta Harper,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.590
Specialist for Francophone
Africa, Laverne Page,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.590
Specialist for Southern Africa, Eve
Ferguson, the Reference Librarian

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.710 position:56%
for East Africa, many of whom are
here today and took a very active --

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.880
were very active in
the whole program.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.250
And now, let me pass the
baton on to Patricia.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.290
Patricia Baine, President
of the African Society

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:42.580
for the National Summit
on Africa who is going

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.290
to make a few remarks as well.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.090
Patricia?

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:58.040
[ Applause ]

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.340
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: I
guess it's good afternoon.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.160
Hi, a very warm welcome to
all of you and especially

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.010
to our poets and writers.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.960
The Africa Society is a nonprofit
organization that works to educate,

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.540
inform, and advocate on
behalf of Africa in order

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.770
to create understanding and to
promote meaningful engagement

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:21.860
with Africa that will encourage
partnerships on culture

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.390
and education and technology
and commerce.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.460
This is why we are very supportive
of [inaudible] education.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:32.510
With increasing advancements
in technology that continue

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:37.100
to bring people closer to us, we
appreciative to you, our writers

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.410
and our poets for your literary
contributions that communicates

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.110
and continue to interpret the
world for generations to come.

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:48.890
We all know the power of a book

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.520
and how a good book can transport
you to a different world.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.380
And while you're there, you
will inevitably learn something

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.260
about the author's world.

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.720
And to us, that is why African
literary work is essential

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.680
in our efforts to educate
about African continents

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.010
because when I was growing up,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.500
all I knew about the west
was what I read in a book.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.620
And so now, we have the same
opportunity as writers and poets

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.700
to communicate our world
to the rest of the world.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.740
We will, at some point here
today, have some students who are

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.770 position:56%
on their way [laughter] and they are
extraordinary educator who's part

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.320
of one of our other flagship
programs, Teach Africa.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.240
They are from the School
Without Walls.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.740
They are very excited to be here
today so when they are speaking

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.930
to you, you'll understand
why they are very animated.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.280
They are all, as I understand
it, aspiring writers.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.720
So enjoy the program and
it's good to meet all of you.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.520
Thank you.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:51.530
[ Applause ]

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.050
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: Thank you,
Patricia and thank you, Mary-Jane.

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:00.120
It's been wonderful to work with
the Africa Society and the African

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.160
and Middle Eastern Division to make
this program in this year possible.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.460
I'm Rob Casper.

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:08.550
I'm the head of the Poetry
and Literature Center here

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.410
at the Library of Congress.

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.360 position:56%
Just a couple of things, let me just
ask you to turn off your cellphones

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.620
and any other electronic
devices that you have

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.350
that might interfere
with this event.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.160
Second, please note this program is
being recorded for future webcast.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.920
You might participate and
you give us permission

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.500
for future use of this recording.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.820
So if you look at the program,
that should be on your chair,

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.810
you'll see the list of the great
poets who are participating.

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.990
I'm not going to go in and do
much in terms of introduction

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.820
of the panelists or the readers.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.710
What I do want to say is as much as
I try to be dynamo in this world,

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.740
I could never match the
wonder of Kwame Dawes.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.640
Kwame Dawes, for those of you
who've ever had the chance to meet

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.960
with him, and especially, for those
of you who had the chance to talk

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.360
to him about what he
is doing on behalf

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.800
of the African Poetry Book Fund.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.250
Know that the kind of ambition he
embodies is the kind of ambition

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:17.280 position:56%
that can change the world and I feel
like he should be up here instead

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.710
of me introducing his family

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:26.430
which are the other editorial board
members who will be participating

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.730
as moderators of discussion.

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.600
We've also asked him to come

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.850
up after the moderator discussion
section to introduce all the poets.

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:38.510
All I can say is thank God for
Kwame Dawes and please welcome him.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:48.040
[ Applause ]

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.210
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Okay, thank
you, thank you, thank you Rob.

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:56.440
And it's good to be back here.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.630
This is -- it's just
a fantastic space.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:03.300
It's a fantastic -- first of all,
it's just a beautiful room, right?

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:07.020
But secondly, you know, I came
to the Library of Congress

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.720
for the first time in 1986.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.590
And I think -- I remember
writing in my journal there is

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.510
so much information
and knowledge here

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:20.650
and I already have quickly
discovered that things

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:24.850
that I've been looking for
in the Jamaican archives

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.790
that I couldn't find,
I was finding here.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:33.630
And I just thought, "With so much
information and knowledge here,

00:08:33.630 --> 00:08:36.710
if we pay attention to it,
we really shouldn't mess

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:40.450
up too much in the future, right?"

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:44.480
And so, for us to be here
and for us to be able

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:47.910
to celebrate African poetry in
this space, I think it's fantastic.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:50.540
And our hope is that
it is the beginning

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.100
of a really continued
relationship that they've been --

00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:56.930
there's been some great
work done before.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:59.290
If you just go online and see
some of the writers who have come

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.070
through here, it's fantastic.

00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:04.620 position:56%
But also, it's to create interesting
conversations and to piggyback

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.180
on other conversations with other
centers and so on and so forth

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:08.750
around the world especially
in Africa.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:10.710
So that's the exciting thing.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:16.380
And I'm really, really grateful to
all involved, you know, from Rob

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:19.390
and Mary-Jane Deeb and,
you know, it's been a --

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.610
it's been a fantastic thing.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:23.860
So I'm just going to
say a few quick words

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:31.000
about the panelists who'll be here
and really to say that for me,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.880
people ask me, Kwame, how are you?"

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:34.820
And I say, "Man, I'm good, man."

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.620
And they'll say, well, why?

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:40.210
[ Laughter ]

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.830
And I say, "I am involved
and working with some

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:45.120
of the most amazing
people that I've ever sort

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.430
of worked together as a group."

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:50.070
And that's the team
that is responsible

00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:51.680
for the African Poetry Book Fund.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:55.680 position:56%
It's the editorial team and here are
the characteristics of that team.

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.650 position:56%
They are all brilliant like no joke,

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:01.790
like really exceptionally
brilliant and bright.

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.460
They volunteer like
their time at time

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.070
when they shouldn't but they do.

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:12.700
They volunteer their time and then
they are the most proactive people

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.260
who are really about community.

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.560
We don't fight.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:17.860
We don't argue.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.040 position:56%
And if today, I just sent like a
text and I said, "Guys, I need this,

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.060
that and that and that," literally,
in a few hours, people in England,

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.990
people -- they're responding
right away.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.290
It's -- I'm not kidding you.

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.230
This is one of the most
amazing teams of people.

00:10:31.230 --> 00:10:33.360
So you're going to meet a
few of them but I just want

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.940
to mention everybody
on the editorial team

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:38.110
of the African Poetry Book Fund.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.690
We've just added two people to our
group, one of whom you'll meet.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.790
One is Phillippa Yaa de Villiersis
who is based in South Africa

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.660
and she just joined
the team this fall.

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.440 position:56%
And she's a wonderful poet, really a
tremendous poet and a great actress.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.030
She's done some tremendous
theater in South Africa.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:11:01.460
So she's there and you know,
we do everything by you know,

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.760
psychic communication [laughter].

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.580
The other person who is
not here is John Keene.

00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:10.020
John Keene is an African-American
poet and thinker

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:12.360
and just brilliant all-around guy

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:16.580
and a translator of
no joke about that.

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.060
He's a serious and
gifted translator.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:21.600
And one of the most
generous people in the world.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.750
Bernardine Evaristo is
a powerhouse in England.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.740
She's literally on her own sort
of energy transformed the position

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.510
of black writers and black writing
in Britain at so many levels

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:36.130
and so she's on that team as well.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.100
And then Gabeba Baderoon who is
from South Africa, wonderful poet,

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:45.410
just all-around fantastic
person and so she's on the team.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.670
So the two -- the three
people that you'll meet today,

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:49.650
first of all, Chris Abani.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:53.470
And typically one need not, you
know, introduce Chris Abani.

00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:56.890
But out of politeness, I will.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.420
Chris -- Chris [laughter] --
first of all, Chris has been like,

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:07.420
the co-partner in the
beginnings of this discussion.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:10.490
And Chris, we tease Chris and say,

00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:13.160
he's the most generous
man in the universe.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.280
We're teasing him kind
of but he kind of has

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:16.740
that -- that gets in him.

00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.480
That's just a part of him.

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.290
But above all, Chris
is a brilliant poet.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.730
And he writes novels and
people think it's great.

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:26.260
But he's really like a
[laughter] far better poet

00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:31.180
than he is [laughter] --
than he is a novelist.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:33.540
And if you haven't read
his book, <i>Sanctificum </i>,

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.540
you should because it will
transform you and make you think

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.620
of poetry in different ways.

00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:42.690
Chris originated from
Nigeria and Chris lives

00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:44.210
and works here in the States.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:46.740
Also coming on stage
is Aracelis Girmay.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:49.210
And Aracelis just joined
the team recently.

00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:51.160
I'll give you a simple example.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.050
Aracelis has just joined the
team and immediately, she's --

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:57.600
she didn't know that
the team volunteers

00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:00.040
to mentor people just
automatically after they look

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.590
at work that is sent to us.

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.100
She didn't know we do that.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.570
And sometimes, the volunteering
is not really volunteering

00:13:05.570 --> 00:13:08.090
like I tell them, you need
to go mentor somebody.

00:13:08.090 --> 00:13:12.550
But typically they just and
spontaneously after our first sort

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:15.810
of go-around, she writes me and
says, look, I really want to work

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:17.980
with this person, and
I go, "Hallelujah.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:20.090
It was like, this is perfect.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:22.130
And Aracelis is an amazing poet.

00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:23.660
I don't know if you know her work.

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.850
But her work is just
powerful and moving and full

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.580
of heart and full of beauty.

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:31.550
And she's, you know,
just a person --

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.910
she's just smart and
thoughtful and fantastic.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.630
So it's great to have
her on the team

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:37.930
and she'll be here talking to you.

00:13:37.930 --> 00:13:39.740
And then finally, Matthew Shenoda,

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:42.510
who is essentially our
security and bodyguard.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.100
[ Laughter ]

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:50.510
He doesn't smile a lot,
that kind of thing.

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:54.420
[ Laughter ]

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.810
Matthew is somebody I trust
implicitly and explicitly.

00:13:57.810 --> 00:13:59.370
I've known Matthew for many years.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:03.270
Matthew is beautiful poet, great
thinker and always thinking ahead

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.510
for what we can do and so on.

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:08.400
The funny thing is Matthew
probably looks like a 50-year-old

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.710 position:56%
but he's really 26 [laughter] and --

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:16.840
but he has twins so that
explains the problem.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.950
But these are fantastic people
and you'll get to know them

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.310
and you'll get to see the
spirit of what we are doing

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.660
and the excitement of it.

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.580
So I welcome them to come on stage
and the discussion will take place.

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.510
All right, so Chris Abani, Matthew
Shenoda and Aracelis Girmay.

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:49.320
[ Applause ]

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.050
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Good afternoon.

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.350
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:53.650
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
then we're all here

00:14:53.650 --> 00:14:57.640
and we need to put this thing on.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.380
Okay. So I was going to say -- my
first question was going to say,

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.310
it was going to be --
why are you involved

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:13.490
with the African Poetry Book Fund?

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:17.310
But now you know [laughter]
after having heard Kwame speak,

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.610
you know, why they're involved.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.590
But I'm still going
to ask the question.

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:25.780
I want each of you -- I'm going to
ask each of you to say something

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:32.380
about themselves but also
in addition to Kwame Dawes,

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:35.910
why did you, why are you
part of this project?

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:42.580
Why, what you think your role
is, should be and, you know,

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.310
how you feel you're
contributing to this project?

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:47.750
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Okay,
hi, you can hear me?

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.150
All right, I always have
to check like a big man

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:52.450
with a small voice [laughter].

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.500
And so, I think for me, perhaps
historically among the group,

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:02.580
apart from probably Bernardine,
have known Kwame the longest.

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.860
And it's on to more
than 20 years now.

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.160
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Yeah.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.460
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: And
what people don't know

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.580
but my first ever poetry workshop
was with Kwame Dawes in London

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:15.300
and so Kwame started something
called the Afro Star School

00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:17.180
of Poetry and he would
come to London,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.160
black British poets had no mentors.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.730
And he would run this workshop.

00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:23.680
And we all were kind of very cocky

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.060
and assumed we knew what we
were talking about and then

00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.130
like I think the first hour, Kwame
sent everyone into like panic.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.760
He's, you know, people were
like, yeah, I'm a poet, you know.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.570 position:56%
Like I've been writing for 15 years.

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:37.410
And Kwame was, "Oh,
that's interesting.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.830
What is your typical
syllabic count per line?"

00:16:39.830 --> 00:16:43.380
And they're like what.

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.570
So Kwame, I sort of have
known and sort of --

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:51.870
I have seen Kwame do things that
Calabash started as a conversation

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:56.000
with Colin Channer in this
aisle of a supermarket.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.160
We were buying orange juice

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.260
and we couldn't find the
large orange juice in England.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.370
And Colin said, I'm so tired of
the way the English would put on --

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:05.670
no big orange juice, you know.

00:17:05.670 --> 00:17:09.450
[Laughter] It's just like them for
small, small festival and things.

00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:12.890
And Kwame said, "Want me to
do a big festival, you know."

00:17:12.890 --> 00:17:15.370
And so I was coming up
behind and I said, "Oh,

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:18.600
we're going to need
a calabash for this."

00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.900
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Absolutely.

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:21.200
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: And
so, what is it is

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.930
where other people have planning
meetings to have planning meetings,

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:28.380
an idea occurs and from
the moment of the inception

00:17:28.380 --> 00:17:31.670
of the idea is already the
planning and implementation of it.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:36.180
So this idea that Kwame has
always had which is to give,

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:41.220
that we as a particular generation
of writers, did not always benefit

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.690
from a generation that
came before us.

00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:45.680
And so his commitment from
the beginning has always been

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:50.620
to provide access and to try to
create an institution around access

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:54.940
that will sustain itself beyond
an individual generosity.

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.330
And that's why I bought into it.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:57.630
It's very simple.

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.930
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Wonderful.

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.400
What about you, Matthew?

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.700
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda: Hello.

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:05.000
Sometimes, I do smile [laughter].

00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:12.380
You know, I think quite
similarly to Chris.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.210
For me, I think it has been --

00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:16.610
I've always been someone
who's believed very deeply

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:18.310
in institution building

00:18:18.310 --> 00:18:21.420
and in creating something
outside of one's self.

00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:26.710
And I think having met Kwame some
years ago and seen what he does

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:29.320
when he first approached
me with this idea,

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.820
I knew that this would
actually happen, right.

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.020
So that was the other
thing, that the investment

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:36.940
of this energy was
going to go somewhere.

00:18:36.940 --> 00:18:39.810
And that we would be
able to create something

00:18:39.810 --> 00:18:41.720
that we hope will live beyond us

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:44.600
which I think is something
I was always raised with.

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:45.980
I was always raised with this idea

00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:49.250
that you can't just
do what you do, right.

00:18:49.250 --> 00:18:51.400
That that you have to
take an active role

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.120
in building community in some way.

00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.780
And I think for many of us, as
writers in this country who come,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.260
you know, from various
places and lived in this kind

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:04.100
of diasporic space,
we've not had that.

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:05.480
We have not had the space.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.370
And so I love the kind of audacity
of the idea of making a space

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:13.990
where we could fit into a space
that would actually hold us,

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:17.450
a space that would be a
foundation for the future

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.110
of who we are and what we do.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:21.890
And then of course, just
the incredible need.

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:28.300
There is, to me, an incredibly like
simple practicality to all of this,

00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:30.660
right, that there is no space

00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.780
that is publishing
contemporary African poetry

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:37.010
in the English language
in any sustainable way.

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:41.630
So the idea is just brilliant in
its simplicity and I think all

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:44.750
of that alone and then working with
these folks -- as Kwame said --

00:19:44.750 --> 00:19:47.590
I have never -- I've
worked in a lot of places.

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:52.000
I've never worked with a group of
people this easy, this committed

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.760
and who just don't -- you know,
nobody asked questions in the sense

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:58.650
of why are we doing this?

00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:03.250
Everyone is just there and doing
the work and laughing through it

00:20:03.250 --> 00:20:05.890
which I think is important as well.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:08.810
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay: Thank you.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.110
Can you hear me?

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:11.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:20:11.410 --> 00:20:14.290
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay: I --
I mean, as Kwame said,

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:20.150 position:56%
I've just joined the editorial board
and was thrilled to have been asked

00:20:20.150 --> 00:20:24.220
and I've gone to the first cycle.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:30.080
But before I joined the board,
I remember getting my first box,

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:34.200
the little Chapbook box and just
had been so excited and [inaudible]

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:39.340
and all that and thinking, which am
I going to read first [laughter]?

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.120
And lamenting but it was
a short-lived lament.

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:47.680
Lamenting the fact that I
hadn't grown with these voices

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:53.780
and then realizing as somebody
who believes that time is strange

00:20:53.780 --> 00:20:56.720
and complicated that
these were voices --

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:58.940
these are voices that
are raised in me.

00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.140
And stretching my vision
and my languages

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:08.840 position:56%
and so I just feel immense gratitude
to everyone who has anything to do

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:16.900
with the poetry book fund and out
of love and greed maybe to listen

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:22.930
as much as I can and to be a
part, you know, no question.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:25.000
That's why.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.300 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: That's wonderful.

00:21:26.300 --> 00:21:28.600
So --

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.070
And so I'm going -- I'm
going to read out the mission

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:40.390
of the African Poetry Book Fund.

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:44.350
It has a very broad mission.

00:21:44.350 --> 00:21:50.190
"It promotes and advances the
development and publication

00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:55.590 position:56%
of the poetic arts of Africa through
its book series, contests, workshops

00:21:55.590 --> 00:22:01.350
and seminars and through its
collaborations with publishers,

00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:06.480
[inaudible], booking agents,
colleges, universities, conferences

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.190
and all other entities
that share an interest

00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:11.650
in the poetic arts of Africa."

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.110
Being the head of a small
division of poetic people,

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:23.330
I think that this is an
enormous -- an enormous task.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:28.940
So looking at the three of
you, I just wanted to ask,

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:33.310
do you see yourself
as performing a part,

00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:37.120
a specific part of
that overall vision?

00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.070
Does each one of you
have a different part

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:43.390 position:56%
or a different role in that mission?

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:47.470
Usually when one sits on the
board, you know, you say, okay,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.210
these are the strengths
of the people

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.650
or this person or that person.

00:22:50.650 --> 00:22:52.320
They complement each other.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:55.140
And each one, in a way,
does something else.

00:22:55.140 --> 00:23:01.430
I might be -- I might be asking a
very non-poetic question, a very --

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:07.470
but I was wonder, as you are
leading this organization

00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:12.030
and this initiative which is it's
very, very exciting, very new.

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:15.290
Do you see yourselves as
performing a specific role?

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:22.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: I actually like to
-- I don't know how many of you know

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.990
about Rastafarians but
I think in a way --

00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:29.080
we have a friend that talks
about being a secular Raster

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:34.310 position:56%
and the idea is that Rasters don't
-- there's an implicit understanding

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:38.650
about a network and
about a hierarchy.

00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.550
But it is not a western
notion of hierarchy.

00:23:41.550 --> 00:23:45.680 position:56%
So like we have to meet or at least,
I have been around for a length

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.910
of time where Kwame
has two nicknames.

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:51.080
One is Father Dawes
because he's the father.

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.510
And the second is Noah
because he knows everything.

00:23:54.510 --> 00:24:00.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.550
So I think it really
works like this.

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.120
The father puts out a call.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:04.420
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay.

00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:05.720
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: And
the disciples answer.

00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.340 position:56%
So sometimes, when Kwame -- I don't
sleep but Kwame doesn't sleep at all

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:13.420
and so I'll wake up at -- I
don't know, like 8:00 A.M.

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:17.860
and they'll have -- you see the
first email from Kwame and it goes

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:21.360
out and says, "[Inaudible],
we need to do this.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.510
Who can help?"

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.390
He has twins so he's
always up next [laughter].

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:30.750
And then you'll see a response
where maybe Kwame says,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:32.050
"We need to do something at AWP.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:34.000
I need a proposal written."

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.210
I wake up and within 10
minutes of that email going out,

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:43.380 position:56%
he has detailed a proposal which
then goes to Kwame who then sends it

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.960 position:56%
to me and then within two-and-a-half
hours, it's already at AWP.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.280
So it's the same -- Kwame
may say, "We have a Library

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.660
of Congress event," and so
it's sort of like everyone,

00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:54.960
there are things we are all --

00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:57.870
we do better than others
but I think it's just --

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.020
it's never really thought
of in that way.

00:25:00.020 --> 00:25:04.460
Instead of this is a house we're
all building, whenever you wake up,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.910
you pick up the shovel
and you start doing it.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:08.580
So there's that part of it.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.730
But I think that it's really
this idea that what we're trying

00:25:11.730 --> 00:25:14.360
to create is a living archive.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.040
We don't think of the archive
as something that is just there.

00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:19.790
It's alive all the time and it kind
of goes into what you are talking

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:24.570
about this notion of a
strange idea of time.

00:25:24.570 --> 00:25:28.270
You have to imagine the
thousands of entries we get

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:32.280
and then you get assigned
60 to a hundred and it's

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.620 position:56%
like we need a turnaround in a week.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:36.800
It's something that's so -- you
start reading it and then you come

00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.180
across voices like these
voices sitting here.

00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.720 position:56%
And you -- something happens --
there's a real humbling that happens

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.710
to us reading it because
you start to --

00:25:47.710 --> 00:25:49.960
you know, there are moments
when Kwame would just call me

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.650
and be like, hey, listen
to this line.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.860
And he would read me
a line from Safia.

00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.790
And I said, "Who the
hell wrote that?"

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.590
And he's like, your cousin.

00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.040
[ Laughter ]

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.900
So I think that what the scope of
it, there is a whole and you know

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.510
like Matthew told [inaudible],
the Pan African notion of this

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.810
because oftentimes you find
that literature tends to kind

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:15.230
of have been very focalized
around West Africa

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:16.880
and Southern Africa
coming from the continent.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.350
But we don't subscribe to that.

00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:20.810
But I think what sustains
in this context

00:26:20.810 --> 00:26:24.050
of creating this is
that we are transformed.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:26.840
It is not -- I don't feel like
we are giving things to people.

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:29.340
I think that they are
giving things to us.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:30.640
They make our works --

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:31.940
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So
it comes both ways.

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:33.460
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: It comes
more towards us, I think,

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:35.490
than people can often
really imagine.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.170
It transforms your work.

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:39.180
It transforms your notion of self

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.460
because you're encountering African
voices you didn't even know existed

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:47.720 position:56%
that articulates in an experience
for you that you know at a DNA level

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.360
but have never thought to
articulate in this way.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.460
So all of it is really about --

00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:55.550
it's more for me, the
gift that it expands us.

00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:58.530
And that, in turn, expansion
I think sustains this idea

00:26:58.530 --> 00:27:02.170
of the global expansion
and so it makes it so easy

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:04.450
to pass the mission statement.

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:06.820
I think what that says
is not even --

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.720
it doesn't even come close
to the gift it is to people

00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.020
who work within this field.

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.870
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Okay, lovely.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.920
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda:
Yeah, I think for me,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.330
the thing is that the work
always comes first, right.

00:27:19.330 --> 00:27:20.830
And I mean the work of the poet.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:23.240
That is at the center of this.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.440
So in terms of a division of labor,

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.790
I think we all just do
whatever needs to get done.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.970
We all have certain skillsets
-- or you know, I mean, for me,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.730
I also work in higher
ed administration

00:27:33.730 --> 00:27:38.310
so doing certain logistical things
in this case is actually enjoyable.

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.380 position:56%
And so it's easy to do them quickly.

00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:47.730
But at the center, I don't think
any of us ever lose sight of --

00:27:47.730 --> 00:27:49.030
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: The whole.

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:51.030
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda: -- of the
core, of the work of the community

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.170
that we're building,
of as Chris said,

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.810
this work that feeds us, right.

00:27:55.810 --> 00:27:58.400
Because at any moment,
even in logistical things

00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:03.830 position:56%
that could get tiresome or annoying,
we've got a ton of work to look

00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:07.560
at that inspires us and
reminds us of what we're doing

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:09.760
and what we're trying to build.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.060
So I don't know that --

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.960
and the interesting thing is as
Chris says, there is no hierarchy.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:18.560
We've never -- I don't think we
have ever had an organizational

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.570
discussion actually.

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:23.430
I don't think we've ever
said, here are the things.

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:27.790
We just kind of worked and we
say, Chris is good at this.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.330
Aracelis is good at this.

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:33.600 position:56%
This poet is someone that
Bernardine would absolutely resonate

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.320
with so let's assign
this person to her.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.310
We just kind of moved through it

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:42.260
without much conversation
actually which, you know, like I --

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:46.410
there's something about the spirit
of this that just allows it carry

00:28:46.410 --> 00:28:49.950
on without us needing
to think of an orchard.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:55.260
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay: I don't know
that it destroys the [inaudible].

00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:01.340
I don't know what, if I have
anything different to add

00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.080
but I guess I'll say I just --
something that I said earlier.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:14.310
I just feel like it's my work or
job or commitment to try to listen

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:20.260
as closely and as deeply
as possible and I mean,

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:22.730
I'm looking at Tsitsi now.

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.650
But I'm just thinking of just the
-- the idiosyncratic imagination

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:36.600
and sound and the worlds and
to allow that to be a school

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:40.440
and to keep asking, you know,
what is it that I'm hearing?

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.980
What are the projects
that I'm seeing?

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.580
How is this -- you should
just go as a listener, I mean,

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:47.850
going back to what Chris
said about humility.

00:29:47.850 --> 00:29:51.160
So I don't -- this is not going to
answer the question about hierarchy

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.940
but I feel like that's all I can
-- that's what I know or how I know

00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.040
to be here and to contribute
is to try to practice that.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:02.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And so all you --

00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:03.720
you all feel as if
you can communicate.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:07.940
You can go to a university and say,
we've got this fantastic project

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.760
that we'd like you to look at.

00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:11.620
I mean, any of you would do that.

00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:14.830
Any of you would call
out someone and say,

00:30:14.830 --> 00:30:17.440
we think we should be
working with you on that.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.240
I'm looking at it in
terms of how that works,

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.380
in terms of organization really.

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:29.340
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: I think all
of us are competent at that.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.180
You know, I also occupy a very
high position in academia,

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.670
an institution, fundraising
is not a problem.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.370
Talking to donors is not a problem.

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:41.670
I wear multiple hats.

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:43.480
I can speak to anybody.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.390
I could be very English
when I need to be.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:46.690
I could be very [laughter] --

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:51.490
I could be extremely Nigerian
when I need to [laughter].

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:54.010
You know, I can guide people
very quickly to their checkbooks

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.240
when I need them to [laughter].

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.480
So and I have no -- this
is a thing too that I have.

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.970
I cannot ask for things for
myself but I have no shame asking

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:07.010
for things for other people.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:09.910
But I'm not even asking
things for other people,

00:31:09.910 --> 00:31:16.460
I'm asking for the support of
an institution, of a thing,

00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:21.250
of an entity that is almost
alive that is beyond individuals.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.420
It's really not about
individuals at all.

00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:27.030
I'm not asking for money for
Tsitsi's book or Mukoma's book.

00:31:27.030 --> 00:31:32.580 position:56%
I'm asking for something that should
exist already and that I'm asking

00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:34.910
for it is already out of sync.

00:31:34.910 --> 00:31:37.260
So I have no difficulty.

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.220
There is no hierarchy but
we -- this is the thing.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.710
We trust Kwame implicitly.

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:44.680
And this is why I think
also articulate in there.

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.980
There is no ego involved.

00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:48.790
It's not like well, you didn't
mention that I did all this stuff.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:51.070
You didn't mention [laughter]
-- in fact, you know,

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:53.230
Kwame is always trying to
deflect attention and credit.

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:56.110
And we're always trying to
like push it in his way.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:32:00.280 position:56%
But we entrust -- so even yesterday,
we sat down, the three of us --

00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.720
Matthew, Kwame and I -- we
were having a cup of coffee

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.190
and Kwame said just,
"Okay, gentlemen.

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:05.490
So what's next?"

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:09.110
And I think we talked for like
20 minutes and I was taking --

00:32:09.110 --> 00:32:10.410
one of us was taking notes.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.910
And then we all kind
of know now what's next

00:32:12.910 --> 00:32:14.810
and it will start evolving.

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:18.030
But just so that I
know, we try not to --

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.190
the fact that there is no hierarchy
and no defined plan, it's not --

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.460 position:56%
we're not running it, you know, like
a Nigerian storefront, you know.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.960
Hey, you [laughter] -- where
you're running to five different

00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:29.760
who will tell you the same five
different things all the time.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:33.120
It's very -- it's a choreography,
but it's a choreography

00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:38.150
where we trust implicitly that sort
of like sometimes, we'll be talking

00:32:38.150 --> 00:32:40.950
and Kwame will say to
Matthew, why don't you do this?

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:42.470
And Matthew will, I
think Chris is --

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:44.110
why don't you handle that
and I'll handle this?

00:32:44.110 --> 00:32:45.410
And there's no [inaudible].

00:32:45.410 --> 00:32:46.710
It just gets done.

00:32:46.710 --> 00:32:49.950
So there is definitely, we
look to Kwame as the hub.

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:51.690
And we trust implicitly.

00:32:51.690 --> 00:32:58.480 position:56%
He has an intuitive understanding of
the spirit of how things can work.

00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.210 position:56%
And then he knows how to execute it.

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:01.760
So there is definitely
that part of it.

00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.060
I hope this answers the question.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:04.360
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yes.

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.470
No, no, no -- it does,
it does, it does.

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.450
Okay, so I am going to ask
you something else now.

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.560
Why don't you say something now?

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:18.870 position:56%
Why don't you tell us something
about the poets that we're featuring

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:23.280
because after all, you have been
the people who have selected it

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:31.980
and how do you as editors respond
to the Chapbook winner's work

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.070
and what have you done from this?

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:39.110
I mean, you're being involved
with this for quite a while

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:45.310
and you've made a selection
and how does that come about?

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.870
So you see I'm sort of
building from organization to --

00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:49.170
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Yes,
to the editorial.

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:52.620
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: So you see from
the general to the more specific.

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.440
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: I should also point
out that the Chapbook box sets

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.200
which are remarkable are
only part of what we do.

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.510
We do first book prizes.

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:03.590
We do -- we kind of
reintroduce poets

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.770
that may have been
forgotten over time.

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:09.940
And we bring into existence
people who were not

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:13.020
like in Patricia's [inaudible]
who have a body of work

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:18.230
but who we realize can -- that
what we can do is position

00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:22.090
in a particular way that
allows the full range

00:34:22.090 --> 00:34:24.230
of who they are to come about.

00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:28.320
So I mean, the very basic thing
is we get all these submissions

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.780
and everyone gets assigned
a reading list.

00:34:30.780 --> 00:34:34.190
And then we narrow down to finals
and then we talk about that.

00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:36.480
And it's always kind of incredible

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:38.230
that there's never
really a lot of debate.

00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:42.000
It almost -- it's almost
instinctively you find the books

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.300
that work.

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.830
And then what Kwame
and I would do --

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:47.220
because we primarily focus on
the Chapbooks is then to go

00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:51.250
through books of work almost ready
for book but aren't quite ready.

00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.090
And then we begin the conversation
with the poet where we say, look,

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:55.530
there's this option
we can offer you.

00:34:55.530 --> 00:34:56.830
Are you interested?

00:34:56.830 --> 00:35:01.980
And what we do is offer -- because
we're dealing with not just people

00:35:01.980 --> 00:35:05.080
on the continent but also
continent -- a kind of --

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.990
a kind of way in which writers

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:12.530
of color are not always offered
respectful mentoring which means

00:35:12.530 --> 00:35:15.490
that we hold you to
extremely high standards.

00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:20.220
But we hold you to those standards
with an intuitive understanding

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:24.660 position:56%
that if you do what we're asking you
to do, you will become excellent.

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.110 position:56%
And this is how we just live anyway.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:29.930 position:56%
So we do that and we're very strict.

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:32.410
When we give people deadlines
and there, we have incidents

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:33.820 position:56%
where people don't meet the deadline

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.910
and then we just roll
over to the next poet.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.590
And they come back, you know,
[inaudible] next try, next year.

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:41.630
And so it gets around
but you know, you go --

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:43.950
we do a lot of international
festivals and you --

00:35:43.950 --> 00:35:47.160
I was recently at the
Ake Festival in Nigeria.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:51.000
And this young man comes up to me
and says, "How much do I owe you?"

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:55.200
And I said, "Who are you
and what do you mean?"

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.500
[Laughter] Not because, you know --

00:35:56.500 --> 00:35:57.800
because I was thinking well
how much can I get from you?

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.540
No, I was kidding [laughter].

00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:01.840
So he was one of the poets.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.120
I had never met him that we
had mentored in this way.

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:06.400
But the idea is that
he couldn't understand.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:10.620
He actually thought there was going
to be a bill for the amount of work

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.240
that went into mentoring him
and the fact that he's going

00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.110
to get these books
and they're published

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.590
and he gets all these copies.

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:19.850
And the notion that
he doesn't have to --

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:23.820
that all is required of him
is to step into his own power.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.560
Sometimes, it's something
that is foreign.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:30.990 position:56%
And so that is part of how -- so the
editorial process is not just a --

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:33.760
it is also about the poems
but it also becomes ways

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:40.260
in which inadvertently you're work
shopping people into an acceptance

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.370
of how powerful they are.

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.440
And so it becomes easy
for us in that way.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:49.960
And then we get together
and then Kwame says to me,

00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:52.420
I need your introduction.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.720
And I'm like, when do you need it?

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.720
Well, yesterday would
have been nice.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.880 position:56%
[Laughter] And you know, oftentimes,
we work under such high pressure

00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:02.490
but it's very easy and
it's a back and forth.

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:07.140
And then we have incidents where
we assign particular writers

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:09.690
to other -- you know,
editors who and we say,

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.230
work with this person specifically.

00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:13.500
We have Helen Yitah who's been work

00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:17.220
to help really bring Amah Ata
Aidoo's work back into public.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:22.660
And sometimes, we're
asking poets, you know --

00:37:22.660 --> 00:37:25.320
we're asking poets who -- you
know how hard it is to say

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:28.510 position:56%
to [Inaudible], I read this poem and
I think you should change this line.

00:37:28.510 --> 00:37:32.320
[ Laughter ]

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.470
So -- well, I'm asking people
whom you're kind of holding

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:39.020
in a certain kind of reverence
at the same time to like --

00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:40.320
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
To make the changes.

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.620
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: To
make these changes.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:45.450 position:56%
And what becomes really beautiful
about it is that they respond to you

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:50.330
in this way where they realize
they too have been hungry

00:37:50.330 --> 00:37:52.520
for a certain conversation.

00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.100
And not just, you know,
then being --

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:55.400
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Not
just being up there.

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.700
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Yeah, that they --

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.000
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
My folks [inaudible].

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.300
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Yeah,
then no one talks to them.

00:37:59.300 --> 00:38:00.750
They want people who could -- so
it works on all kinds of levels

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:04.590
in this way and I don't
know if you --

00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:06.910
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda: I mean, I
don't know that I have much to add

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:08.370
to that other than the fact

00:38:08.370 --> 00:38:12.080
that that cultivation is very
important for us, I think.

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:15.530
And for the young writers
especially those on the continent,

00:38:15.530 --> 00:38:19.810 position:56%
we know they have limited access
both to a certain body of literature

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.890
as well as to workshops
and these kind of things.

00:38:22.890 --> 00:38:26.360
So we spend a lot of time back and
forth with them doing, you know,

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.660
critiques and line edits
and this kind of thing.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.700 position:56%
But even for the writers in diaspora
and here in the United States,

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:35.760
those of us who have
published extensively

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:41.240
in this country also know the
lack of an editorial criticality

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:46.090
that exists in the U.S. publishing
as it relates to African writers

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.690
and writers of color in general.

00:38:48.690 --> 00:38:50.750
And so I think there
-- that has opened

00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:54.690
up for me some really
beautiful conversations.

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:57.030
Like you know, Bob
Marlowe once said,

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:59.600
"If you know who you are then you
would know where you're coming

00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.470
from then you wouldn't have to ask
me who the hell do I think I am."

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:07.830
[Laughter] I think in a way, that's
almost a model for the relationship

00:39:07.830 --> 00:39:11.390
that we have with people
because there is --

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:16.770
there is a kind of foundational
sense of who we're working with.

00:39:16.770 --> 00:39:18.940
And who they're working
with as editors

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:22.940
that we can immediately move
the conversation to a new level

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.950
and actually engage in the
work, engage in the aesthetics,

00:39:26.950 --> 00:39:30.120
engage in the craft
and what is happening.

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.620 position:56%
We don't have to ask these questions

00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.450
about like what does
this word mean --

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.580
or what's that or where do you
find this country on a map?

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.590
Or I mean, this is stuff
where frankly I'm --

00:39:40.590 --> 00:39:43.310
you know, look, I mean when I
published my first book which was

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:45.690
through a great publisher
here in the United States,

00:39:45.690 --> 00:39:51.270
I remember clearly my, you
know, white editor said,

00:39:51.270 --> 00:39:53.300
"This is really interesting
but I don't --

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:56.110
I don't think that I can
say anything to you."

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:57.610 position:56%
And I said, "Well, you're an editor.

00:39:57.610 --> 00:39:58.910
Isn't that your job?"

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:01.040 position:56%
[Laughter] And he said, "Yeah, but,
you know, like it makes me nervous."

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:03.270
And he was very honest with me.

00:40:03.270 --> 00:40:05.200
He said, "You know,
from critiquing this,

00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:07.350
I don't know about the
cultural this and that."

00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.010
And I just thought, all
right, we're not going

00:40:09.010 --> 00:40:11.080
to have a real conversation
here, right?

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:15.950
Because I can't -- you know,
there's too much behind

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:17.710
that that needs to
get a word through.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:20.630
And so I think that you
know, one of the great things

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.450
about our team too is that we're
an incredibly diverse group

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:24.750
of people, right.

00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:29.230 position:56%
We represent the diversity of the
African continent and its diasporas.

00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:33.670
We represent it in terms of,
you know, gender, ethnicity,

00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:37.190
language bases, aesthetic
practices, all of these things.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:40.670
And so I think that there's
always one of us who can connect

00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:43.930
to a writer in a very
meaningful way.

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:50.560
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay: I
don't have a [inaudible].

00:40:50.560 --> 00:40:51.860
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
those writers, do they --

00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:58.090
do they have an input
in other writers' works?

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:00.730
In other words, let's say
you've worked with someone

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:04.970
and you've published that person,
you go back to that person and say,

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.800
well, you know, I've
read something, you know.

00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:09.320
I'd like to have your
opinion on that.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.890
Do you do that sometimes?

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:14.320
I mean, is there more than --

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:15.620
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda:
Just a group of us.

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:16.920
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Yeah.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.220
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
Than the group of you?

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:19.520
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Well, we're working

00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:20.820
on a great anthology
with Tsitsi here.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:22.120
So we absorb people all the time.

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.410
But what has been most beautiful
to watch is the conversation

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:27.930
that happens amongst the poets.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:35.160 position:56%
We had a reading last year and to
see Warsan Shire, Safia and Ladan --

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:41.820 position:56%
sort of an East African coalition of
female poets having a conversation

00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:45.960
on a street in Chicago is you know,

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.810
as if it were -- this
is -- it's done.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:50.150
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And how did
you come about meeting them

00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:51.450
on the street in Chicago?

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:52.750
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Well, because
we all organized an event.

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.050
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Oh, okay.

00:41:54.050 --> 00:41:55.350
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: But what I'm
saying too is that you find

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.730
that when you start --
because we've been --

00:41:56.730 --> 00:41:59.950
so we have almost 50
Chapbooks in the world now.

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.860
And Kwame and I would have said

00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:05.380
that by the time we have a
hundred Chapbooks floating around,

00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.680
that we will stop to have --

00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.380
to be able to sort of think
about what are the trends,

00:42:09.380 --> 00:42:10.930
what are the conversations.

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:12.900 position:56%
But 20 Chapbooks in, you start to --

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:15.160
you're reading a Chapbook
and there is a poet

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.460
in Nigeria referencing
Ladan's poem in his poem.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:20.820
And you start to realize
that the conversation --

00:42:20.820 --> 00:42:22.840
this is what I mean by
it's a living archive.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:25.960
And we don't need that
part of it too.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.620
You don't need to -- you
don't need to organize it.

00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:31.390
It happens naturally.

00:42:31.390 --> 00:42:35.710 position:56%
You see conversations happening
between Patricia's work and you look

00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:38.430
at a line and you think, wow, that
must have been reading Patricia.

00:42:38.430 --> 00:42:43.870
Mukoma and so you notice of this is
a living tradition in its own way.

00:42:43.870 --> 00:42:46.890
So and that is what has been
most beautiful about it is

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:50.140
that the poets are having
these conversations directly

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.580 position:56%
or indirectly in amongst themselves.

00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:58.310
And so that each book that comes
out essentially changes the pattern

00:42:58.310 --> 00:43:00.500
of the next book that comes out.

00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:03.970
And the quality of the books
that are coming out make people

00:43:03.970 --> 00:43:08.320
who haven't had access to being
held to a certain accountable level

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.400 position:56%
within the aesthetics because these
poems is -- they're not just saying,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.060
okay, we're going to
publish some African poets

00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:14.360
because they're African.

00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.660
These poets stand.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.960
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: They stand out.

00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: And I would say that
they stand better than American --

00:43:18.260 --> 00:43:20.780
I put my money on this, you know.

00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:23.030
And so, they -- you started --

00:43:23.030 --> 00:43:25.660
it sort of is affecting
the quality of the entries.

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.160
The qualities of the entries
are getting higher and higher

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.740
because there is a conversation
happening that we're not in control

00:43:31.740 --> 00:43:34.870
of and we don't want to be
in control of in that way.

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:37.540
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And is
it, again, I'm off the theme

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.710
but your conversation
is so interesting

00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:41.230
because I want to continue.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:46.920
Is it something that those poets
are bringing in terms of imagery,

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:54.970
in terms of language, in
terms of looking at a reality

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:59.020
which everyone sees but they
can express in a different way?

00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:04.670
What is it that stands out that
immediately grabs you and says,

00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:08.590
okay, that's someone
we want to publish?

00:44:08.590 --> 00:44:11.180
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay:
I mean, I'm so --

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:14.690
I'm so new so I hesitate
to say it but just

00:44:14.690 --> 00:44:17.630
to somebody who's been
following from outside,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:22.840
I had a bit of anxiety
thinking about how to talk today

00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:25.010
or be a contributor today.

00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:31.280
And say anything about
African writing or poetry

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:35.470
because I have trouble saying
anything about poetry and I know

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:37.060
that that's something
that people still --

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.920
I've heard Kwame, and Matthew,
and Chris talk, you know,

00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:47.490
about how difficult it
can be to find any trends.

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:59.030
But I'll say that as a
reader, I'm struck by --

00:44:59.030 --> 00:45:00.920
it depends on each
person's work, right?

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:02.910
I'm struck by sound.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:04.210
I'm struck by image.

00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:07.430
I'm struck -- but one of the
things that keeps moving me

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:11.930
and surprising me especially with
the new three books that came out

00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:15.450
but it's with all of
the books really --

00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:22.460 position:56%
is what happens with place, and with
ancestry, and lineage and thinking

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:28.450
about -- I'm thinking of Ama Ata
Aidoo writing towards Bessie Head.

00:45:28.450 --> 00:45:33.160
And so hearing this,
getting to kind of listen --

00:45:33.160 --> 00:45:37.160
put my ear to the door on this
communication between poets

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.130
but also how and I don't
think that this is specific

00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:44.450
to the poets published by APBF

00:45:44.450 --> 00:45:49.270
but how many places each
poem, each person holds?

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:53.910
And at once and all the various
ways that Ladan is doing it

00:45:53.910 --> 00:46:01.020
or Safia is doing it or -- and
that again, I'm not quite --

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:09.220
it's not particular to this group
of people only but I'm struck

00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:17.530
by the places being held in poems
in English because I have it.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:22.930
I had access to that -- or heard
those exact places or the kohl

00:46:22.930 --> 00:46:24.390
under the eyes with that.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:30.260
I hadn't had access to those
families outside of my imagination

00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:36.800
in family and that
strikes me especially.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Just to add to that.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:41.780
I always think of poems
as automaton.

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.650
I think of a poem as a virus.

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:47.550
And the job of a virus
is to mutate endlessly

00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:50.340
and to resist any control of it.

00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.920
And this is what these
poets achieve with language.

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:56.530
Just with language alone.

00:46:56.530 --> 00:47:03.840
In both Ladan and Safia's work,
there is a simultaneity of language

00:47:03.840 --> 00:47:07.860
where fracture would
normally lead to loss.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:12.680
Fracture here becomes a way
of multiple embodiment, right.

00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:15.050
So that what would
normally be [inaudible] --

00:47:15.050 --> 00:47:16.820
there is not that there
is not a melancholy

00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.410
but this is what I
love about melancholy.

00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:19.920
Melancholy is not lost.

00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.970
Instead of a bittersweet desire,
it's sort of you know, it's like --

00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:25.830
it's like when you cut
yourself and it scabs, I mean,

00:47:25.830 --> 00:47:28.010
you pick at the scab when
you shouldn't and it bleeds

00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:29.400
but it's such a delicious thing?

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.600
[Laughter] This is melancholy.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:35.260
And so -- and all of
these poems, you know,

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:39.800
the way in which Tsitsi's
work embodies a thing

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:42.450
that you would not think
would make sense in poetry.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:48.100 position:56%
The idea of a zebra clan that exists
in western English style poetry,

00:47:48.100 --> 00:47:53.400
but sustains not only sort of
this idea of stripes like the way

00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:56.370
which a zebra's body is
already multiplicities, right.

00:47:56.370 --> 00:47:59.000
But that these multiplicities
aren't in the skin.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:00.590
They're actually on
the skin and you know,

00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:02.010
zebras aren't colored on the hair.

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:05.680
It's on the body and can hold
that but then use that to talk

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.420
about simultaneity, about
patriarchal reduction but also

00:48:10.420 --> 00:48:12.120
like a feminist resistance.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.820
It's the simultaneity of it all.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:20.090
And it's done linguistically with
Arabic, with Shona, with English,

00:48:20.090 --> 00:48:25.050 position:56%
with line ends, with blind fractures
so that what you end up with are all

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:30.090
of these beautiful cartographies
that don't amount to loss.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.160
They actually amount
to a tremendous hope.

00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.810
And that is what we look for and
we find it endlessly existing.

00:48:35.810 --> 00:48:37.110
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda: Yeah.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:39.360
I'm just going to add very briefly

00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.360
to that is this is
very exciting to me.

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:46.140 position:56%
I actually -- one of the things that
I find most incredible is the way

00:48:46.140 --> 00:48:51.150
that this newer generation of
poets has embodied their complexity

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:55.160
as a fundamental part of their
humanity and as kind of broken

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.700
out of certain modernist
traditions around the notions

00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.910 position:56%
of identity and honing these things.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:05.330
And what this has done for me in
particular, I think about this

00:49:05.330 --> 00:49:09.380
as a professor contemporary
and [inaudible] poetry.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:15.180
This has fundamentally
shifted poetry, period, right?

00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:19.510
It has changed the way that
we relate to language, right.

00:49:19.510 --> 00:49:22.400
And of course, they're not the only
ones who have done this, right.

00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.080
There's many traditions of,
you know, Native American poets

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:28.390
and other poets who have
kind of moved through that.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:32.970
But the way that it is shaping the
English language is very exciting

00:49:32.970 --> 00:49:34.270
to me.

00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:37.800
So it's almost like a new English.

00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.610
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: And
that's the reason --

00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:42.290
that's the reason why I had asked
because I had read something

00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:49.070 position:56%
about French doing -- French has
been enriched by African literature.

00:49:49.070 --> 00:49:52.120
And someone was commenting,
the imagery is different.

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:56.440
The language is different and it
has added to the existing body

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:59.120
of the French language
and literature

00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.090
with new ways of looking at it.

00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:05.450
So you actually are
answering my question.

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:16.730
So I had asked something about how
do you feel and this is something

00:50:16.730 --> 00:50:22.190
that would be in asking all
our writers as they come.

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:26.380
How do you feel that your mission
connects to the American --

00:50:26.380 --> 00:50:28.990
to the American literacy?

00:50:28.990 --> 00:50:31.470
What does it add to the
existing American --

00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:38.060 position:56%
and I'm saying in the broader sense,
American in all its shapes and forms

00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.090
and ethnicities and [inaudible]?

00:50:41.090 --> 00:50:48.260
What does your own work, the work
of the African Poetry Book Fund,

00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:51.980
what does it add to
the existing trends?

00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:53.520
What do you feel it adds?

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.320
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Oh, I would
just really start by saying

00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:02.510
that to be American is not
to be from the United States.

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:03.910
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Yeah,
it's from the world.

00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:05.210
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Right
and that everything

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:08.360
that is American has to do with --

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:09.660
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
The rest of the world.

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:10.960
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: Yes.

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.260
And in the ways in
which a particular kind

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:13.970
of ideology may have been exported.

00:51:13.970 --> 00:51:18.050
But it has been reconstituted
and given back to you.

00:51:18.050 --> 00:51:21.080
And this is what allows America.

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.930
There's even this boast of
freedom, this boast of inclusive --

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:29.640
all of this is not because
of a particular sort of way

00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:30.940
in which America existed.

00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:34.810
It is because America is
continuously being reformed

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:36.260
and not reformed here.

00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:39.420
If you walk through Nepal,
there are people listening

00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:41.980
to Michael Jackson and
drinking Coca-Cola.

00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:44.780
And they have a very clear
idea of what America is.

00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:48.460
And whether we realize
it or not, when you --

00:51:48.460 --> 00:51:52.180
that is also being absorbed
back into Americanness.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.460
And so I would say
fundamentally then

00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:59.930
that what these poets are
doing is reshaping America.

00:51:59.930 --> 00:52:03.400
Now there's also and I just
want to put this out there.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:07.690
There is no African identity
without early Caribbean

00:52:07.690 --> 00:52:12.620
and African-American movements
towards self-articulation.

00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:16.330
All African independence movements
are predicated on the work

00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:21.210 position:56%
that was done by Marcus Garvey,
that was done by Martin Luther King,

00:52:21.210 --> 00:52:24.030
Jr. It was done by
writers like Ellison.

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:28.210
Most of the Nigerian where
the First Republic started

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:30.380
and how were they started
in America.

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:34.330
Early West African politicians
came home and wrote books

00:52:34.330 --> 00:52:38.260
about how they would shape
the modern African identity.

00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.010
This kind of modernist
way of thinking exists

00:52:41.010 --> 00:52:44.190
so what's fascinating
is that even the concept

00:52:44.190 --> 00:52:48.120
of the modern African has
been articulated and begun

00:52:48.120 --> 00:52:50.150
in absence of the continent.

00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:53.710
It is started by Africans
who lived in America.

00:52:53.710 --> 00:52:56.400
So most of us are musically --

00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.680
all of [inaudible] has to
do with these musicians --

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.600
African-American blues musicians
arriving on the docks of Ghana

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.060
in the 19th century and
teaching [inaudible]

00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.770
to kids who then incorporate it.

00:53:04.770 --> 00:53:07.110
So there's really no way
to be a modern African

00:53:07.110 --> 00:53:08.410
without already being an American.

00:53:08.410 --> 00:53:10.850
There's more to being American
without being an African.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.440
So we're not just articulating
[inaudible].

00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.400
We're also articulating a
kind of African-Americanness

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:20.100
because that conversation has
already been started for us.

00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:22.330
So we're starting to look
at the idea of what it means

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.780
to be a global black person.

00:53:24.780 --> 00:53:29.250
And to have equal access even to
things people say you don't own.

00:53:29.250 --> 00:53:31.580
And not in sentimental
ways but in this case,

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:33.570
in fully embodied beautiful ways.

00:53:33.570 --> 00:53:37.650
So that -- those are just two
things I would throw out there.

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.250
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay:
Gosh, I mean, it's so --

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:45.300
I love and returning to what
Chris said about fracture

00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:49.500
and not fractured into
loss but to something else.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:56.740
And what I keep hearing and
thinking about is the story of --

00:53:56.740 --> 00:53:59.570
I keep thinking of the story
of ISIS going and looking

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:03.940
for the different parts to
put [inaudible] together

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:11.190
and all I can say -- I just
the possibility of returning

00:54:12.310 --> 00:54:16.880
of ourselves to ourselves,
to possibility.

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.680
What might we do in language?

00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.020
How might we be in language?

00:54:21.020 --> 00:54:22.320
What is a page?

00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:25.500
What is a -- I mean,
I keep referring back

00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:27.730
to the three new books
that just came out.

00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:33.870
And I said to Safia,
I can't -- I can't --

00:54:33.870 --> 00:54:37.260
the genuine [inaudible] is just so
stunning to me and also each page.

00:54:37.260 --> 00:54:41.770
And like I just think,
oh, a page might be a sea.

00:54:41.770 --> 00:54:46.700
A page might be a --
what is a mark on a page?

00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:52.810
I just feel like the --
the more we have access

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:55.000
to each other's imaginations
and places,

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.710
and ways of accessing our
imaginative strategies,

00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:07.350 position:56%
the more my person, my being on this
Earth is stretched open and returned

00:55:07.350 --> 00:55:10.960
to my imagination is grown.

00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:15.270
And so I can't help but think
even though I tend not to think

00:55:15.270 --> 00:55:18.850
on a kind of national level.

00:55:18.850 --> 00:55:25.370
I can't help but think that
this place is just continuing.

00:55:25.370 --> 00:55:29.910
It's going through a trajectory
of being enriched by everywhere.

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:36.110
But I cannot point and have names.

00:55:36.110 --> 00:55:40.710
The shape is not [inaudible].

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:47.610
It has never been but now I have
some names to [inaudible] to that.

00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.910
Okay.

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:50.210
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:55:50.210 --> 00:56:00.060
And now, for the last question
and then we move to the speakers.

00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:04.790
So I'm going to ask
each of you anyway,

00:56:04.790 --> 00:56:08.500
what you hope to accomplish
in the coming years.

00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:13.080
You've already all done so
much and published and edited

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:20.160
and created this fantastic
movement, I would say.

00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:26.940
What -- when you look in the coming
years, what you hope to accomplish?

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:35.100
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda:
It's a big question.

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:39.320
To take over the whole
contemporary literature [laughter].

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:41.000
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Oh, wow!

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.800
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: That's why
he works for [Inaudible].

00:56:42.800 --> 00:56:46.330
[Laughter]

00:56:46.330 --> 00:56:47.700
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda: You
know, I think that --

00:56:47.700 --> 00:56:54.600
I think that we're all committed to
a sustainable systemic structure,

00:56:54.600 --> 00:56:58.270
an institution building
that allows for this work

00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.270
to carry on for many generations.

00:57:01.270 --> 00:57:03.860
And I think that that will
include a lot of things.

00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:05.530
I mean, we've talked
quite a bit and, you know,

00:57:05.530 --> 00:57:07.870
we're all connected to
universities as well.

00:57:07.870 --> 00:57:11.040
So we've talked about the
scholarship pieces of this

00:57:11.040 --> 00:57:14.400
and the importance of creating
pathways for certain kinds

00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:17.420
of scholarship about
this work to emerge.

00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:20.610
We've talked about the
intersections especially with much

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:25.080
of this contemporary work with
film and the ways that we will need

00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:30.200
to kind of find spaces to embrace,
you know, other media as well.

00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:33.670
And of course, the visual
arts -- I think that you know,

00:57:33.670 --> 00:57:36.960
aspirationally we have
very big ideas on what we'd

00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.900
like to see in the coming years.

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:41.250
And I don't think that
it's -- that's not APBF.

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:46.940
I think that that is the dream of
this work going out into the world

00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:50.560
and doing its own thing which we're
already beginning to see, right,

00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:54.490
that the work itself
will create new things.

00:57:54.490 --> 00:57:59.010
So I mean, I think from my
standpoint, that's what I hope.

00:57:59.010 --> 00:58:02.100
I hope that my children, if any
of them were to become writers

00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.050
and I hope not because I'll
have to read [inaudible].

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:05.350
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb:
You have this whole --

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:07.260
this whole group out
there [laughter].

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:10.060
&gt;&gt; Matthew Shenoda:
But I hope that they --

00:58:10.060 --> 00:58:15.320
that they will have a
structure to plug into like,

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.500
a community that sustains
them and that mentors them

00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.770
at a different level
than what we had.

00:58:20.770 --> 00:58:24.630
And it's not that I lament what we
had but I think that, you know --

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:26.890
I hope to see that evolution.

00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:29.100
And I think, you know, this
is very interesting to me.

00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:32.660
I mean, this is very --
it's scary in a lot of ways.

00:58:32.660 --> 00:58:34.770
Not necessarily for us but I think

00:58:34.770 --> 00:58:37.950
for this society in
particular, right.

00:58:37.950 --> 00:58:42.090
I mean what Chris and Aracelis
were just talking about is also

00:58:42.090 --> 00:58:46.250
about the absolute, you know,
dissolve of certain borders

00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:50.030
and canonical structures which
is what this work is doing.

00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:53.940
It's actually erasing things
to create brand-new things

00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:57.270
that people don't yet know how
to wrap their minds around.

00:58:57.270 --> 00:59:02.050 position:56%
And I think -- you know, I'm excited
to see what it does on its own.

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:04.300
I think that it's a
very organic thing

00:59:04.300 --> 00:59:08.790
that will grow certainly
without any of us.

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.680
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Thank you.

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.120
What about you?

00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:14.420
&gt;&gt; Aracelis Girmay:
I mean, I love --

00:59:14.420 --> 00:59:20.290
I love what you said and
I also -- again, I just --

00:59:20.290 --> 00:59:24.640
I feel like I need to
do some more listening

00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:28.000
to what it is already before I say.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.300
But I believe in what you
said that the momentum --

00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:36.860
the momentum of it already
and just being excited

00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:42.700
to see what organically
comes of that.

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.000
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Chris?

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.610
&gt;&gt; Chris Abani: So when
people think about terms --

00:59:49.610 --> 00:59:54.320
the terms of humanity that we bring
to other people, we -- what we --

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:59.900
and we do this through race, class,
and gender, disability, body --

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:06.010
we like to imagine that people have
a different inner life than we do,

01:00:06.010 --> 01:00:09.990
that a person who works at
McDonald's does not have as rich

01:00:09.990 --> 01:00:12.690
or even a richer inner
life than we do.

01:00:12.690 --> 01:00:16.260
And therefore, we think
we cannot access them.

01:00:16.260 --> 01:00:20.200
But the truth about literature
-- and this is my hope always --

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:25.780
that I became a writer because
of James Baldwin, right,

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:30.640
because I read "Another
Country" when I was 10 years old.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:34.700 position:56%
And the fact that there is no way
James Baldwin could have imagined my

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:39.370
existence, that his book would
travel 6000 miles through time

01:00:39.370 --> 01:00:43.390
into an African country, and that
a young boy would read this book,

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:49.590 position:56%
and who -- his entire aesthetic will
almost mirror Baldwin's in this way.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:52.590
So what his books are doing
is that they are proving

01:00:52.590 --> 01:00:57.230
that their inner lives, that there
is not African, there is no other.

01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:59.110
There is just human.

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:02.000
And so my hope is that five years

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:07.090
from now a 12-year-old white
boy will wander into a store,

01:01:07.090 --> 01:01:13.550
and in a discount bin if necessary,
find "January's Children" by Safir,

01:01:13.550 --> 01:01:16.830
and when he is 21, and he's
signing a book and someone says,

01:01:16.830 --> 01:01:19.620
"What book made you
want to be a writer?"

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.400
He will say Safir's inner life
made my inner life possible.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.830
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Wonderful.

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:28.130
Well, thank you.

01:01:28.130 --> 01:01:31.510
And I think we should
all give them a big hand.

01:01:31.510 --> 01:01:44.830
[ Applause ]

01:01:44.830 --> 01:01:50.790
And now Kwame Dawes will come
and introduce our ten speakers.

01:01:50.790 --> 01:01:54.830
I'm still very shaken
by all I heard,

01:01:54.830 --> 01:02:01.690
and I hope you have all been a
little transformed by our speakers,

01:02:01.690 --> 01:02:07.030
and you will now with our eight.

01:02:07.030 --> 01:02:09.010
Eight? Yes, okay -- seven.

01:02:09.010 --> 01:02:12.540
Okay, seven.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:27.100
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: Okay, so we've got
-- I'm counting, one, two, three,

01:02:27.100 --> 01:02:31.370
four, five, six, seven
fantastic poets.

01:02:31.370 --> 01:02:35.200 position:56%
Listen, I want us to use the balance
of the time to just hear the poets,

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.630 position:56%
because the truth is, that's kind of
the proof of the pudding, isn't it?

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:45.060
And so you've got programs.

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.900
Everybody's got programs?

01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:52.700
Yeah, so read their -- read the
details about them at your leisure.

01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:54.890
Yeah, you can do that [applause].

01:02:54.890 --> 01:02:57.000
Yeah, and so what I'll do
is I'll just name them.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000
I'll give you their
names, and that kind of,

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.580
you know, ladies and gentlemen.

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.570
And then they'll come one
after the other to read

01:03:03.570 --> 01:03:05.610
in the order they are
introduced, then.

01:03:05.610 --> 01:03:12.690
All right, so Chekwube Danladi,
Safia Elhillo, Tsitsi Jaji,

01:03:12.690 --> 01:03:21.260
Mukoma Wa Ngugi, Ladan Osman, Hope
Wabuke, Patricia Jabbeh Wesley.

01:03:21.260 --> 01:03:25.770
They're going to all read, all
right, one after the other.

01:03:25.770 --> 01:03:32.330
And you'll be moved, flabbergasted,
astonished, and stunned.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:36.020
And I thank these guys for
their fantastic conversation

01:03:36.020 --> 01:03:44.130
and discussion and yes, we
are taking over the world.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:46.510
Let's hear it for them.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:57.520
[ Applause ]

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.120
&gt;&gt; Chekwube O. Danladi: I
didn't realize I was first,

01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.740
so we'll see how I do.

01:04:01.740 --> 01:04:05.090
Yeah, can everyone hear me well?

01:04:05.090 --> 01:04:13.650
Okay. All right, I'm going to start
with a poem called "Salt, Alum."

01:04:16.430 --> 01:04:18.660
You can touch me.

01:04:18.660 --> 01:04:21.020
I've been so good.

01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.860
I have been especially
still, all this time,

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:29.290
each of my palms made a
bed for your untucking.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:34.460
Me, the meal made from
reused chicken grease,

01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:37.610
eased and always saying yes.

01:04:37.610 --> 01:04:44.290
Gender is cunning; the ruination
unwitting -- a stolen position.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:51.640
I have been bent over, the
beast dug out of me, the jewels.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:56.140
Pleasure light pops the eyes,
obsidian sticks in the throat,

01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.530
even this body doesn't register.

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:04.550
The knuckles fold toward Lake
Michigan, the gut hardens,

01:05:04.550 --> 01:05:10.910
oxalate builds in the kidneys,
the tongue is a grateful peasant.

01:05:10.910 --> 01:05:14.320
For a beating I can
answer to a middle name.

01:05:23.730 --> 01:05:27.400
This poem is called
"At the Lavender Farm."

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:34.030 position:56%
Fingers already spent, but lingering
on my hips, a sexual pal obsessed.

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:39.520
We travel down past the docks,
take rest on a patch of grass.

01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:42.910
The batik print cloth
is laid out beneath us,

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:47.850
our beers leaving footprints,
rings, sloppy circles

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:51.890
of a local Wisconsin brew we
are happy to designate home.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:56.330
We enact our slovenly myth-making,

01:05:56.330 --> 01:06:01.220
the hybrid names we leave our
children, something Russian,

01:06:01.220 --> 01:06:06.020
something Ebo [assumed spelling],
the natural meanings queered.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.120
Your voice momentarily
dulcet, you edge the sentiment

01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:12.240
and ask me to love you forever.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:17.330
I swallow, my mouth sour, say,
"Ask me something difficult."

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:21.440
It's here we love pretending
to be old,

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:25.680
love twisting this coaxial
longing into reality.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.430
We are trying.

01:06:27.430 --> 01:06:30.770
No one else we know
is this gullible.

01:06:30.770 --> 01:06:35.270
Around us the lavender stocks run
the risk of being too beautiful.

01:06:35.270 --> 01:06:39.570
At dusk they, too, seem
to embody their condition.

01:06:39.570 --> 01:06:44.080
The smell of purple,
another kind of useless joy.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:48.680
Hair nestled on your
chest, stroking scars.

01:06:48.680 --> 01:06:51.530
I understand the risk of excess.

01:06:51.530 --> 01:06:55.800
I sniff your tufts of armpit
hair because I adore your musk.

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:01.560
I've left myself, [inaudible] as
generously as how much I gift you,

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:05.090
perhaps an evidence that
I am always this easy.

01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:08.740
If I am mewing on your
behalf, scold me better.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:13.720
The moon meets us, its carmine
fate is trite, tomorrow,

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:19.360
returning to exile draws new
lust and brings us to our feet.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:24.920
We toe the spume of the lake,
the water an impossibility.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.880
My hand at the back of your
neck, I want to remind you

01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:31.790 position:56%
for our sake, nothing good is banal.

01:07:40.570 --> 01:07:45.020
This poem is a little gross, so I
hope you guys will bear with me.

01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.620
Not too bad.

01:07:46.620 --> 01:07:49.380
It's called "Deer Head."

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:56.640 position:56%
Fall has unleashed its yellow, love
a solace extenuated from its bearer.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:00.840
On my afternoon walk,
alone this season,

01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:03.620
I come to the elementary school.

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:08.820 position:56%
There in the butterfly garden a deer
head rides on its carnal prolixity,

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:12.890
flesh skimmed in some
places, dark color ablated

01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:17.860
by November's hard sun,
white bone exposed.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:21.390
I'm drawn to its sickness,
flies and all,

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:24.490
the fetid odor leaning in to speak.

01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:30.080
My hand finds its muzzle,
mandible exposed, the hanging offal

01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:33.250
where the carcass has been severed.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:36.380
Prone to uttering absolutes,
I say nothing is more natural

01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.720
than this, and remain undeterred.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:44.630
Your eyes still intact and
expressive, I arrive honest

01:08:44.630 --> 01:08:48.910
with my desperation, my
claim unsophisticated.

01:08:48.910 --> 01:08:54.390
Buck, I am the son you want,
my own eyes thick as amulets,

01:08:54.390 --> 01:09:00.160
the hard edges of me cloven, all
of these tensions bifurcated.

01:09:00.160 --> 01:09:03.620
With opportunity, I would not
have left you in such uneasy rest,

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:07.050
dead with the solitude
of lesser creatures.

01:09:07.050 --> 01:09:10.820
As most progeny may
attempt eventually,

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:14.530
your decomposition is now
a lesson for my grief,

01:09:14.530 --> 01:09:18.870
the distress of my medic
souvenir of identification.

01:09:18.870 --> 01:09:22.330
We two flexing the
fiction of temporality,

01:09:22.330 --> 01:09:27.260
our time that cannot be
broken, this image of us.

01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.920
Around your antlers curl
newly-bloomed clematis,

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:34.220
and I am reminded that this
month later it will snow.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.870
My head and yours will
be blanketed, washed.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.460
"I Used To Be Called Olivia."

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:56.990
I dug my own unbecoming
as much as you.

01:09:56.990 --> 01:10:02.470
Thirst became ritual, the wallop
of water soaking into the earth,

01:10:02.470 --> 01:10:05.530
myself wafting off as dust,

01:10:05.530 --> 01:10:10.980
an openness invited
inward, blue, and enough.

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:13.190
I imagined childhood a swamp.

01:10:13.190 --> 01:10:18.720
Wet, my small self, nappy
hair doubled by cockleburs,

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:22.410
easy name [inaudible]
spineless and clean,

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:29.100
muck-suckling the shame quickly,
new abode forming, holding.

01:10:29.100 --> 01:10:30.900
Thank you.

01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:40.460
[ Applause ]

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.800
&gt;&gt; Kwame Dawes: We're going to
have a little change of order,

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:44.030
and wanted to say something
about Patricia,

01:10:44.030 --> 01:10:46.990
who is amazing powerhouse poet.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:51.140
And she has to leave early,
so she's going to read now.

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:54.760
It is our honor that we could
get to publish Patricia's work,

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:58.350
and she has been a great
champion -- a fantastic champion.

01:10:58.350 --> 01:11:02.910 position:56%
And like, you know, she's the mother
like hardcore, like real deal.

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.540
And I'm sure you're
going to enjoy her.

01:11:04.540 --> 01:11:07.510
Patricia, thank you so much, yeah.

01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:16.090
[ Applause ]

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.460
&gt;&gt; Patricia Jabbeh Wesley:
Yeah, please forgive me,

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:22.420
my younger sisters and daughters.

01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:25.450
I'm becoming the grandmother now.

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:33.980
Yeah, and I'm so grateful
to this team.

01:11:33.980 --> 01:11:38.970
When I was coming up for tenure,
my university decided to --

01:11:38.970 --> 01:11:43.240
the letter they sent me, they
decided to quote some lines

01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:49.480
from the external reviewers --
lines that put the university on,

01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:54.680
you know, like [inaudible]
university for, you know,

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.860
why were they [inaudible]
the treatment I was getting?

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.520
But one of the things one

01:11:58.520 --> 01:12:04.870
of the reviewers said is what
Kwame is doing right now.

01:12:04.870 --> 01:12:08.440
He said -- and this is a professor

01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.980
who is a distinguished
professor at Tennessee.

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:18.110 position:56%
He said, "Fifty years after Patricia
is dead before scholars will know

01:12:18.110 --> 01:12:21.870
what she is doing to
American poetry,

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:28.550
that she's bringing [inaudible]
Africa in America, in the West

01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:32.430
and Africa to converse
on the same page."

01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:36.900
And that's what Kwame is
doing in multiple books.

01:12:36.900 --> 01:12:39.200
And that's why I'm proud.

01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:44.560
This is a newer poem
I will start with.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.440
It is -- I am going to this order,
reading the powerhouse reading

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.650
of protests in the
next hour is starting.

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:59.690
This poem is entitled "Too Many
Chickens Are Coming Home to Roost."

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.630
Let us open the doors.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:07.440
Let us lift the shuttles over
the threshold of the doors.

01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:10.610
Let us remove the bars
from the doorposts.

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:13.930
Too many chickens are
coming home to roost.

01:13:13.930 --> 01:13:17.060
And it is not the storm.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:20.590
It is not the August
or September hurricane.

01:13:20.590 --> 01:13:24.970
It is not the storm that's driving
home all the angry of heart,

01:13:24.970 --> 01:13:27.690
all the hate that like aged-tar

01:13:27.690 --> 01:13:31.620
or broken pavement has
lifted onto the roads.

01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:35.890
And now too many chickens
are coming home to roost.

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:38.800
Let us open the doors
not to let them in.

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:43.650
Let us open the doors
to let them out.

01:13:43.650 --> 01:13:46.580
Do not turn down your lights.

01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:50.500
Do not go to bed with
your eyes closed.

01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.160
Do not let out your young sons.

01:13:54.160 --> 01:13:57.710
Do not wander into unknown places.

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:00.030
Do not listen to the wind.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:05.230
Too many roosters have come
home to drive us away from town.

01:14:05.230 --> 01:14:08.440
We who came running from the fires

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.040
of our homelands are now
being told to flee again.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.910
Too many roosters have
come home to roost

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:20.520
because it is not a thing
we can hold in our safety.

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:27.040
It is not a thing we can place a
finger upon to sooth away hurt.

01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:30.320
It is as hard as a
[inaudible] stone,

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:35.310
as hard as pain as an open sore.

01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:48.320 position:56%
Now I will read from -- you know,
the problem is if you follow a poet,

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.510
you know, from town to town, you
will end up being very bored --

01:14:53.510 --> 01:15:00.120
[ Laughter ]

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:03.660
-- because when they find out
that a particular poem works,

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:09.360
they will keep reading it over, and
over, and over until you get bored.

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:12.690
So keep following us,
you will have problem.

01:15:12.690 --> 01:15:20.610
When I was a -- when I was growing
up, I didn't know I was talkative.

01:15:20.610 --> 01:15:30.820
It was my stepmother who was -- and
she was a mean, mean little witch.

01:15:30.820 --> 01:15:36.330
So everybody knew she
was a mean witch, okay.

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:39.780
So whenever she said, "Shut up!"

01:15:39.780 --> 01:15:41.500
My name is -- "Marie, Shut up!

01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.850
Can you just shut up your talking?"

01:15:43.850 --> 01:15:45.720
And I always said she hates me.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.760
And then I grew up and
went to high school,

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.430
and the bullies told
me I was talkative.

01:15:50.430 --> 01:15:53.850
So here's a poem I
wrote for my stepmom --

01:15:53.850 --> 01:15:57.790
memory of my stepmother,
"When I Was a Girl."

01:15:57.790 --> 01:16:00.530
My stepmother used to
say, "Shut up, Marie.

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:04.540
Shut up! A woman should be quiet."

01:16:04.540 --> 01:16:09.320
So I tried shutting up one
minute, two minutes, three,

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.800
but then something inside my belly
began to rise up like sourdough,

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:17.520
rising, rising slowly, rising.

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:22.630
Something tightening up like
a big knot, the kind that ties

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:27.940
up forest branches as if something
needed knotting up for the trees

01:16:27.940 --> 01:16:31.500
and the branches not to know
movement, not to know air,

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.830
not to know the freedom
a bird knows.

01:16:34.830 --> 01:16:37.530
And my belly will say to me,

01:16:37.530 --> 01:16:40.740
my little tiny 14-year-old
stubbornness,

01:16:40.740 --> 01:16:45.710
the kind that lets a
stepchild know she has power.

01:16:45.710 --> 01:16:51.700
And before she knew it, sitting
there next to my huge stepmother,

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:56.740
her heaviness of heart and body led
to the heaviness of slapping hands.

01:16:56.740 --> 01:16:59.980
I had to remember what
my pa told me,

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:03.170
"A woman shouldn't
be shut up, Marie."

01:17:03.170 --> 01:17:07.580
And then four minutes, I'd begin
talking again, talking fast,

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:10.630
talking fast, carrying
on like the pepper bird

01:17:10.630 --> 01:17:14.340
in the Liberian dawn, a
bird without business.

01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:17.870
And the knot at my
bellybutton would loosen,

01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:22.080
and before I could speak again,
I'd hear her say, "Shut up, Marie!

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:25.210 position:56%
Something will shut you up someday."

01:17:25.210 --> 01:17:29.320
And I'd look across from her,
sitting on a dented stool,

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:34.950
somewhere in our old kitchen a
huge pot, boiling without worry.

01:17:34.950 --> 01:17:38.780
And I'd stare into her fine,
mean eyes, and I'd say,

01:17:38.780 --> 01:17:41.560
"All right, Ma, all right."

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.350
But before she swallowed
in satisfaction,

01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:49.050
I'd begin chattering again,
chattering on with friends,

01:17:49.050 --> 01:17:54.400
chattering about the worries
of a 14-year-old stepchild.

01:18:03.420 --> 01:18:05.600
Okay, where is my poem?

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:09.300
Oh, I thought I found
my poem, and now, okay.

01:18:09.300 --> 01:18:11.680
"Send Me Some Black Clothes."

01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:16.190
Well, one of the cultures
that we have in Africa is

01:18:16.190 --> 01:18:20.090
that when your father
dies you mourn for a year.

01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:21.440
You wear black.

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.130
You wear black for six months,

01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:27.050
and then you wear [inaudible]
mourning for six months.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:32.240 position:56%
And when your husband dies, you may
mourn for what, two years, you know.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.650
And when you take off the
black people will want

01:18:34.650 --> 01:18:37.130
to know why you're
taking off the black.

01:18:37.130 --> 01:18:41.500
So I wrote this poem just
before the Liberia Ebola.

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:46.460
And I wrote it because I went home,
and I had so many people to bury.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:50.930
And then few months after I left,

01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:56.010
what this poem is saying actually
happened, that people were dying

01:18:56.010 --> 01:18:59.720
by the hundreds and
thousands, of Ebola.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:04.200
"Send Me Some Black Clothes."

01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:07.790
Elegy for my homecoming.

01:19:07.790 --> 01:19:13.690
Sweet sorrow of family reunions
around the dead, so I get dressed

01:19:13.690 --> 01:19:18.970
for another funeral where I'm
almost ashamed to burden my friends

01:19:18.970 --> 01:19:24.350
with news of another dead relative,
as if I were some storehouse

01:19:24.350 --> 01:19:31.050
of dead people, as if I could earn
a living announcing news of my dead

01:19:31.050 --> 01:19:33.430
or dying brothers and sisters.

01:19:33.430 --> 01:19:39.030
I returned home walking into
a place of dead bodies here.

01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:45.090
In Monrovia, only corpses, the same
manner in which I left decades ago,

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:49.870
walking through dead bodies
of my people during the war.

01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:54.340
Someone please send
me some black clothes.

01:19:54.340 --> 01:19:59.960
Liberians are dying like earthworms
after a long, rainy night,

01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:06.470
dying the way centipedes crawl out
of a burning shed to die quietly.

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:10.810
They say love has many
zigzags, many harms.

01:20:10.810 --> 01:20:15.580
They say if you live long,
you will see something.

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:20.550
[Inaudible], the woman named
after [inaudible] of whom I sing

01:20:20.550 --> 01:20:26.530 position:56%
in my poems, of whom I've strung
these scribbled words around verses.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:31.470
[Inaudible] namesake has died, so
Uncle [inaudible] travels 500 miles

01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:36.180
of rugged terrain by road and
dust because there is no room

01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.720
to make excuses not
to bury your sister.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.820
So here I am, lost daughter
come home for something else,

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.040
and I find myself standing
among caskets.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:52.410
Life has rotted away
the remains of lack.

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:56.100
When a country decides to
rise up not from their uncles,

01:20:56.100 --> 01:21:00.380
but from their head, as those
at the ankles die of lack.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:04.440
As if living in lack where
it [inaudible], I say,

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.760
"Send me some second
mourning clothes

01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:12.310
so to spread along the footpaths
so millipedes can crawl.

01:21:12.310 --> 01:21:16.130
Send me some second mourning
clothes, my people, please."

01:21:16.130 --> 01:21:19.280
Liberia smells again of corpses.

01:21:19.280 --> 01:21:24.520
The poor are burying their dead,
so let the rivers swell in rage.

01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:27.340
Let drums cry dirges
against the wind.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:30.400
Let mutiny break out upon the dawn.

01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:35.970
There is too much death in town,
so I asked for the town crier.

01:21:35.970 --> 01:21:37.420
He, too, is dead.

01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.990
I asked for the horn blower.

01:21:39.990 --> 01:21:41.290
He, too, is dead.

01:21:41.290 --> 01:21:43.190
I asked for the [inaudible].

01:21:43.190 --> 01:21:45.080
The [inaudible], too, is dead.

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.700
I asked for the young
virgins and their suitors

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.870
that used to line the roads.

01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:52.830
They are all dead.

01:21:52.830 --> 01:21:55.540
Someone please holler for me.

01:21:55.540 --> 01:21:58.900
Someone please send me
some black [inaudible]

01:21:58.900 --> 01:22:02.250
to cover the ground
in the Harmattan dew.

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:12.510 position:56%
I will read two more, and then I
will sit down -- or I will walk out.

01:22:12.510 --> 01:22:17.440
[ Laughter ]

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:21.280
Then I will walk out.

01:22:24.250 --> 01:22:27.440
"For My Children, Growing
Up in America."

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:34.440 position:56%
One of the saddest things about life
is that you never know tomorrow.

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:37.360
You know, in Africa you
say nobody knows tomorrow.

01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:42.360
Nobody knows tomorrow,
Mama, oh, you know.

01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:47.640
So when I was 30, 31,
32, we built our house,

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.870
and I planted 20 coconut trees.

01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:55.280
I planted mango, breadfruit,
papaya, everything.

01:22:55.280 --> 01:22:58.380
And now my son has cut down
half of the coconut trees.

01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:01.820
He says they are -- you know,
they're going to fall on the house.

01:23:01.820 --> 01:23:06.080
But -- and my dream was that my
kids would climb these trees.

01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.080
And then we fled a year
after we built the house

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:10.840
and planted the trees.

01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.940
"For My Children, Growing
Up in America."

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:19.520
Wishing you more than the
sunshine, more than the trees,

01:23:19.520 --> 01:23:23.640
more than the hills rising,
as if hills didn't only grow

01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:29.210 position:56%
but also talked, and walked, and had
time for climbing hills themselves.

01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:35.220
Wishing you all more than you could
ever wish to hold in your hands.

01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:39.220
Wishing life were a bed you
could unmake and remake,

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:45.740
covers to roll under, lift off,
or roll all over until sunrise.

01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:51.120
Wishing you could stand along the
old river that still flows back

01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:55.000
at home, where the Atlantic
still carries its patience

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.330
as a woman carries a newborn
on her back, a woman who knows

01:23:59.330 --> 01:24:04.700
that the navel string is as tender
as dewdrops in the Harmattan.

01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:08.540
Wishing I could still hold you,
and keep you, and make you cry

01:24:08.540 --> 01:24:13.780
until all your eyes were free
again, the way you used to be free.

01:24:13.780 --> 01:24:17.400
Wishing that the sun
were not just up above,

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.010
something we could all
keep for ourselves,

01:24:20.010 --> 01:24:22.400
so when the clouds got all cloudy,

01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:25.660
we could let out our
own little sunshine.

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.890
Wishing that the trees
I planted in my backyard

01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:30.960
in my early years were here.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.410
Trees I dreamed my children
would climb and fall from,

01:24:34.410 --> 01:24:37.730
and then we would rush them
to the car to take them

01:24:37.730 --> 01:24:39.800
to the hospital right up the road.

01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:44.220
Wishing they would be
there for their cousins

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:50.070
who outnumber the grains of sand on
the beaches along Sinkor's shore.

01:24:50.070 --> 01:24:52.380
Wishing you, my darlings, had grown

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:55.480
up where the trees do
not lose their color,

01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:58.710
where color does not
lose its brilliance,

01:24:58.710 --> 01:25:03.740
where color is not the defining
line, where today is before us

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:08.470
as if today were tomorrow, a
never-ending day of winding roads

01:25:08.470 --> 01:25:12.210
and deep footpaths, leading
us back to Cape Palmas.

01:25:12.210 --> 01:25:18.310
I'll read the last one, and
then I will give you your thing.

01:25:18.310 --> 01:25:21.010
Okay, I will read -- I will
make sure I read a [inaudible]

01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:26.210
of the poem that, you know,
that follows me around.

01:25:26.210 --> 01:25:29.110
When you get bored, just
throw something at me.

01:25:29.110 --> 01:25:30.810
"I Want to Be the Woman."

01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:34.470
I don't want to be the other woman.

01:25:34.470 --> 01:25:41.150
Don't want to stay up
nights for the phone call.

01:25:41.150 --> 01:25:46.080
Take your excuses and pour them
down some rusty drain as if

01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.000
from a wine bottle, and
kill yourself at dawn.

01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:54.980
I want to stay the woman
who stands there waiting,

01:25:54.980 --> 01:26:01.490 position:56%
so her husband's lies rest like dust
on the windshield of an old car.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:06.230
I want to carry deep scars
of brokenness all my life,

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:11.220
like our mothers' mothers' mothers,
who did not learn how to kill

01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:15.390
that old African polygamy,
but killed it anyway.

01:26:15.390 --> 01:26:20.670
I am the woman, the maker of
the bed, the unused love keeper,

01:26:20.670 --> 01:26:25.460
the breeder of fine children,
scarred only by broken dreams

01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.870
in the broken places where
our foremothers found company

01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:34.560
with other women, and buried their
babies' naval strings with hopes

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.700
that someday, someday
something would happen.

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:44.420
No, I am already the woman, Khade
Wheh, head wife, the housekeeper,

01:26:44.420 --> 01:26:49.760
Khade, the owner of the afterbirth
and the afterbirth pains,

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:55.430
Khade Wheh, the holder of hot
pots, the keeper of the homestead,

01:26:55.430 --> 01:27:00.350
the fireplace holder, the
powerless powerful African woman

01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:04.020
after the old paths of lonely
women betrothed too early

01:27:04.020 --> 01:27:06.760
to unknown ugly men.

01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.480
No, I am not looking for love.

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:13.830
This body is too old
for lovers to hang

01:27:13.830 --> 01:27:17.600
out in my dreams or
in my daydreaming.

01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.050
Don't lie to me.

01:27:19.050 --> 01:27:21.730
I am too beautiful for you.

01:27:21.730 --> 01:27:26.900
Don't fool yourself,
I do not need love.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:30.880
I do not think my [inaudible] new
love, and I used to hear her say

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.450
that love could not make a farm.

01:27:33.450 --> 01:27:37.800 position:56%
My [inaudible], whose bare feet grew
thorns from walking back and forth

01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:42.530
from farm to farm homestead, from
farm to town, from tilling the land

01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:48.030 position:56%
like a husbandless wife, [inaudible]
who entertained all the small wives

01:27:48.030 --> 01:27:50.460
of an already blind husband.

01:27:50.460 --> 01:27:55.530
My [inaudible] who was not too
blind to sleep with multiple wives.

01:27:55.530 --> 01:27:58.930
But [inaudible] had only one
husband, despite the crowd

01:27:58.930 --> 01:28:01.980
of wives populating her marriage.

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:06.650
Yes, I want to be the
villain only to my husband.

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:11.250
I want to ground my last
years under a cold blanket

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:14.420
to guard my woman parts
from your invasion.

01:28:14.420 --> 01:28:18.120
I want to greet my
ancestors, our mothers,

01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:21.410
with this old piece
of my brokenness.

01:28:21.410 --> 01:28:26.460

he granted his brothers

You, highway-robbed
of you, endless gift.

01:41:04.190 --> 01:41:20.430
Thank you.

01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:46.140
[ Applause ]

01:41:46.140 --> 01:41:47.440
&gt;&gt; Mukoma Wa Ngugi: Hello.

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:48.740
&gt;&gt; Hello.

01:41:48.740 --> 01:41:50.700 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Mukoma Wa Ngugi: Yeah, now I just
have this image of me and Tsitsi,

01:41:50.700 --> 01:41:53.430
we have known each other
since, yeah, the early 1990s.

01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:56.610 position:56%
I just had this image of us 20 years
from now walking with walk-sticks,

01:41:56.610 --> 01:41:58.890
you know -- you know,
walking sticks.

01:41:58.890 --> 01:42:00.870
And then say, "Yeah, I've
known her for 40 years now."

01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:04.690
And so I'm only going to
read two or three poems.

01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:10.750
But I have another event at
3:00, so please most of you come

01:42:10.750 --> 01:42:12.050
with me when I'm leaving.

01:42:12.050 --> 01:42:16.870
All right, okay, I'll
stop the jokes.

01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:20.580
And I do believe all poets at some
point wanted to be comedians, but.

01:42:20.580 --> 01:42:24.680
Yeah, I just wanted
to say, you know,

01:42:24.680 --> 01:42:28.610
nobody has ever asked me how
I ended up getting published

01:42:28.610 --> 01:42:32.570
by the Africa poetry book fund,
but what happened, though,

01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:35.770
is I came across a -- one of the
books they had previously published

01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:39.980
by Clifton Gachagua
called "Madman at Kilifi."

01:42:39.980 --> 01:42:43.180
You know, and I read it, and I
was seized by a rage of jealousy,

01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:50.430
so I compiled my poems
and sent them off.

01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:54.240
No, actually, no I was
consumed by a -- by --

01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:57.130
you know, because he's much younger
than me, so it was more of a --

01:42:57.130 --> 01:43:00.150
of feeling a sudden
embrace, you know,

01:43:00.150 --> 01:43:02.630 position:56%
from the African literary tradition,
something along those lines.

01:43:02.630 --> 01:43:04.620
So you know, of feeling
that poetry is safe,

01:43:04.620 --> 01:43:07.160
so I could send mine
out to the world again.

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.710
And so the first poem I'll
read is called "Hunting Words

01:43:09.710 --> 01:43:13.100
with My Father," which
is poem I wrote for him

01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:16.030
for his 70th birthday
instead of buying a present.

01:43:16.030 --> 01:43:18.200
You know, it's cheaper to write.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:21.440
But anyway, "Hunting
Words with My Father."

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:30.900
He's also a writer, so you know,
I've said this elsewhere, but --

01:43:30.900 --> 01:43:32.200
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right.

01:43:32.200 --> 01:43:33.500
&gt;&gt; Mukoma Wa Ngugi:
[Laughter] Yeah, you know.

01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:37.790
Yeah, he's also -- he's a
somewhat-known writer from Kenya.

01:43:37.790 --> 01:43:40.580
"Hunting Words with My Father."

01:43:40.580 --> 01:43:43.460
One morning I burst into
my father's study and said,

01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:46.270 position:56%
"When I grow up, I too want to hunt.

01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:50.220
I want to hunt words, and giraffes,
pictures, buffalos, and books."

01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:54.740
And he, holding a pen and a cup
of tea said, "Little Father,

01:43:54.740 --> 01:43:56.190
to hunt words can be dangerous.

01:43:56.190 --> 01:43:58.820
But still, it is best
to start early."

01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:03.030 position:56%
He waved his blue pen, and his
office turned into Nyandarua forest.

01:44:03.030 --> 01:44:06.770
It was morning, the mist rising
from the earth like breath as rays

01:44:06.770 --> 01:44:09.730
from the sun fell hard on
the ground like sharp nails.

01:44:09.730 --> 01:44:11.380
"Little Father, do you see him?"

01:44:11.380 --> 01:44:13.870
my father asked "No," I said.

01:44:13.870 --> 01:44:15.170
"Look again.

01:44:15.170 --> 01:44:16.470
The mist is a mirror.

01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:17.770
Do you see him?"

01:44:17.770 --> 01:44:19.070
And I looked again, and there
was a Maasai warrior tall

01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:20.810
as the trees, spear in hand.

01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:23.620
"Shadow him, feign him,
feign his movements,

01:44:23.620 --> 01:44:26.430
shadow him until his
movements are your movements."

01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:28.960
Running my feet along the
leaves, I walked to where he was,

01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:35.780
crouched like him so close to
the earth, feet sinking deeper

01:44:35.780 --> 01:44:39.390
into the earth as if in mud,
turning and reading the wind,

01:44:39.390 --> 01:44:42.580
and fading into the mist until
I become one with the forest.

01:44:42.580 --> 01:44:45.930
For half a day we stayed
like this, tired and hungry.

01:44:45.930 --> 01:44:50.240
I was ready for home, but my father
said, "I did not say this was easy.

01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:52.950
You cannot hunt words
on a full stomach."

01:44:52.950 --> 01:44:55.940
And just as soon as he spoke, there
was a roar so loud and stomping

01:44:55.940 --> 01:44:58.820
so harsh that hot underground
streams broke open like a dozen

01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:03.090
or so water pipes, sending hissing,
steaming water high into the air.

01:45:03.090 --> 01:45:06.310
I turned to run, but the
warrior stood his ground.

01:45:06.310 --> 01:45:09.360
As the roar and thunder came
closer, his hair, braided and full

01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:11.410
of red ochre, turned
into dreadlocks --

01:45:11.410 --> 01:45:15.730
dreadlocks so long that they seemed
like roots running from the earth.

01:45:15.730 --> 01:45:17.250
When the transfiguration
was complete,

01:45:17.250 --> 01:45:20.450
before me stood a Mau Mau
fighter, spear in one hand,

01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:21.920
homemade gun in the other,

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:25.510 position:56%
eyes so red that through the mist
they looked like hot molten cinders,

01:45:25.510 --> 01:45:28.980
the long dreadlocks a thousand thin
snakes in the wind, the leaves,

01:45:28.980 --> 01:45:31.520
and the grass, and
thorns rushing past him.

01:45:31.520 --> 01:45:32.820
"You must help him.

01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:36.070
Don't just stand there, help
him," my father implored.

01:45:36.070 --> 01:45:39.400
But just as soon as I had closed
my little hands into fists,

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.870 position:56%
the lion appeared high up in the
air, body stretched the whole length

01:45:42.870 --> 01:45:44.680
as the Mau Mau fighter
pulled the spear

01:45:44.680 --> 01:45:46.990
like it was a long
root from the earth.

01:45:46.990 --> 01:45:49.930
The lion, midair, tried to
stop, recoiled its talons

01:45:49.930 --> 01:45:51.730 position:56%
to offer peace, but it was too late.

01:45:51.730 --> 01:45:55.370
And he let out another roar as
his chest crushed into the spear,

01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:58.270
breastplate giving way until
the spear had edged its way

01:45:58.270 --> 01:45:59.900
into the heart.

01:45:59.900 --> 01:46:03.750
Dying, then dead, it continued
its terrible arc, and landed.

01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:06.580
I waved, and the picture
stood still.

01:46:06.580 --> 01:46:09.690
My father came up to me and asked,
"Why have you stopped the hunt?"

01:46:09.690 --> 01:46:11.360
I said, "But we killed it.

01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:13.480
I have what we came for."

01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:16.080
I pointed to where the Mau Mau
warrior was pulling his spear

01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:18.630
from the carcass, but my
father shook his head and said,

01:46:18.630 --> 01:46:21.220
"You have done well,
but look closely.

01:46:21.220 --> 01:46:23.760
How can you carry all
that in a word?

01:46:23.760 --> 01:46:25.060
How can we carry that home?

01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:26.360
It is too heavy."

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:29.640
I laughed and said,
"Father, you'll help me."

01:46:29.640 --> 01:46:33.140
But he pointed to the ground, to
a steady flow of a bright, thin,

01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:37.320 position:56%
red river furiously winding down the
grooves of the spear to the earth.

01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:41.270
I too pointed, unable to speak, the
beauty larger than my imagination.

01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:42.570
I was confused.

01:46:42.570 --> 01:46:44.320
I had no words.

01:46:44.320 --> 01:46:47.070
"Come, let us go home,
Little Father.

01:46:47.070 --> 01:46:50.250
When you are of age you shall
find the words," he said.

01:46:50.250 --> 01:46:51.930
"But always be careful.

01:46:51.930 --> 01:46:54.880
To hunt a word is to hunt a life."

01:47:00.650 --> 01:47:02.630
So when I wrote --
most of these poems,

01:47:02.630 --> 01:47:04.600
when I wrote them I wasn't
writing them with a [inaudible] --

01:47:04.600 --> 01:47:07.950
they're the poems I think
I wrote because I had to,

01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:09.250
because of things that
were happening.

01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:12.800
For example, my daughter's birth.

01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:15.420
You know, so in that sense,
it's not poems I was writing

01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:17.070
with the idea of a collection.

01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:18.940
Though I don't -- I'm
not going to lie and say

01:47:18.940 --> 01:47:21.490
that I was writing
for myself, you know.

01:47:21.490 --> 01:47:23.380
But yeah, so it was for --

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:26.600
I wrote most of these poems for
things I couldn't quite grasp.

01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:30.100
And this is for my daughter,
who is here somewhere,

01:47:30.100 --> 01:47:32.130
whom we named after my
late mother, Nyambura.

01:47:32.130 --> 01:47:37.410
So this is a play around her
name, which means bringer of rain.

01:47:37.410 --> 01:47:39.330
"In Your Name."

01:47:39.330 --> 01:47:42.240
Bringer of rain, I know
someday I will learn to call you

01:47:42.240 --> 01:47:47.460
by the name your mother and I
gave you, but for now the myriad

01:47:47.460 --> 01:47:51.210
of little names will do,
[speaking in foreign language],

01:47:51.210 --> 01:47:56.260
all names that amuse us now,
so often as they will not you.

01:47:56.260 --> 01:47:57.630
[Speaking in foreign
language] Let's face it,

01:47:57.630 --> 01:48:02.060
even hate me for having
them in a poem,

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:05.320
but [speaking in foreign language],
Little Mother, you'll not abandon.

01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:08.570
Yes, it will first tie you
down, tongue-tie your teachers

01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:12.850
and friends, but one day your
name, Nyambura, will free you,

01:48:12.850 --> 01:48:16.320
and that which was once like a
prison will be a warm embrace,

01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:19.060
and that past from which you
come from will be an anchor

01:48:19.060 --> 01:48:24.580
and not a chain, each syllable
a reminder and an echo.

01:48:24.580 --> 01:48:28.050
Let me read my last poem,
you know, because, you know,

01:48:28.050 --> 01:48:30.130
even though I wrote the poems
before the age of Trump,

01:48:30.130 --> 01:48:33.150
I just have to say something
about Trump, you know,

01:48:33.150 --> 01:48:36.310
and I have this joke that
I was thinking about like

01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:38.670
if you really want to hide the
nuclear codes from trump, you know,

01:48:38.670 --> 01:48:46.940
put them in a library,
or [laughter] so, right.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.240
&gt;&gt; Oh! Oh!

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.670
&gt;&gt; Mukoma Wa Ngugi: But you know,
but the poem is really about,

01:48:53.670 --> 01:48:57.600
you know, for most of us, you know,
who have not been in the U.S.,

01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:58.900 position:56%
we're the first-generation Africans,

01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:00.640
and we have been here
for a long time.

01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:03.350
You know, around questions of
identity that I think, you know,

01:49:03.350 --> 01:49:06.430
the Trump and his anti-immigration,
then you know,

01:49:06.430 --> 01:49:09.320
brings these questions
back to the forefront.

01:49:09.320 --> 01:49:11.510
"My Two Names."

01:49:11.510 --> 01:49:15.160
I have tried, but I'm never hungry
in Nairobi and full in Boston.

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:18.160
No matter my will, the
parallels will not collapse.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.930
It's a [inaudible] my
stomach, this one we share.

01:49:20.930 --> 01:49:24.240
Sometimes I try for daylight
here to surprise nightfall there.

01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:26.930
By riding the divide of night
and day, the sun is large

01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:30.200
in such a place that I'm always
awake here and asleep there.

01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:33.590
I am without a name,
yet I bear two names.

01:49:33.590 --> 01:49:35.180
I am without a name.

01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:36.480
I bear four names.

01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:38.010
I'm nameless.

01:49:38.010 --> 01:49:40.110
Always outside my window,
my shadow restless

01:49:40.110 --> 01:49:42.840
like a ghost calls me
to find its parallel.

01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:45.770
When I left home, I found
it dancing here with a rope

01:49:45.770 --> 01:49:47.690
and an effigy outlined in chalk,

01:49:47.690 --> 01:49:50.770
and we took turns being
shadow and being.

01:49:50.770 --> 01:49:54.100
When I close my eyes to
this sun or moon burns teal,

01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:57.850
the world around me keeps
changing form, and I make a home.

01:49:57.850 --> 01:50:00.270
But flight, too, has a
shadow, and I fall back

01:50:00.270 --> 01:50:02.330
into things I cannot name or touch.

01:50:02.330 --> 01:50:04.470
What I cannot name, I cannot touch.

01:50:04.470 --> 01:50:07.170
One day I'll have to
speak for myself.

01:50:07.170 --> 01:50:10.830
One day in my bones, marrow-deep,
and complete like a grenade,

01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:14.380
I find remnants of
ghosts that have walked

01:50:14.380 --> 01:50:17.250
and lived hard before me
[speaking in foreign language],

01:50:17.250 --> 01:50:19.060
all born in times when
the modern collapse

01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:22.500
of parallels was a
stretcher as is treason.

01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:25.820
Home is longing not to
be in two places at once.

01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:29.560
This morning, there I woke up to
sounds of mourning and tear gas,

01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:31.680
graves as shallow as
my writing paper,

01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:34.150
deep like diamonds and coal mines.

01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:37.350
This morning here, I awoke to
a cup of tea with fresh ginger

01:50:37.350 --> 01:50:40.310
and mud, someone's black blood.

01:50:40.310 --> 01:50:42.330
There this morning 30 years ago,

01:50:42.330 --> 01:50:44.370
I witnessed Kamadi's
[assumed spelling] hanging.

01:50:44.370 --> 01:50:47.940
This morning here, 30 Puerto
Rican Nationalists were hanged.

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.880
One day I will have to
speak to all of ourselves.

01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:52.680
I thank you.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:51:09.930
[ Applause ]

01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:11.230
&gt;&gt; Ladan Osmun: Good afternoon.

01:51:11.230 --> 01:51:13.970
&gt;&gt; Good afternoon.

01:51:13.970 --> 01:51:16.140
&gt;&gt; Ladan Osmun: It's always an
honor to read with the Book Fund.

01:51:16.140 --> 01:51:20.590
Thank you so much for the work that
you do, the editors, writers there,

01:51:20.590 --> 01:51:23.800
the partnership with
Prairie Schooner.

01:51:24.950 --> 01:51:30.830
So I wanted to chill a little
bit, but I could not be so close

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:35.890
to the Supreme Court and not read
this newer poem which is written

01:51:35.890 --> 01:51:42.530
for Mohammed el Gharani who was
a juvenile Guantanamo detainee

01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:43.830
from Chad.

01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:48.650
When asked what it was that he
wanted, he said, "An apology."

01:51:48.650 --> 01:51:53.040
And because there's a sense that
he's categorized as a non-person

01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:57.120
for this form of detainment and
torture to work, it doesn't appear

01:51:57.120 --> 01:51:59.690
that that apology is forthcoming.

01:51:59.690 --> 01:52:07.730
Okay. And I want to start
with an introduction,

01:52:07.730 --> 01:52:11.540
an excerpt from Laura
Marling's "What He Wrote."

01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:18.760
Forgive me here.

01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:21.930
I cannot stay.

01:52:21.930 --> 01:52:24.790
He cut out my tongue.

01:52:24.790 --> 01:52:30.600
There is nothing to say.

01:52:30.600 --> 01:52:33.780 position:56%
Love me? Oh, Lord, he threw me away.

01:52:33.780 --> 01:52:36.790
He laughed at my sins.

01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:38.640
In his arms I must stay.

01:52:38.640 --> 01:52:43.970
He wrote, "I'm broke.

01:52:43.970 --> 01:52:46.890
Please send for me."

01:52:46.890 --> 01:52:52.040 position:56%
But I'm broken, too, and spoken for.

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:55.320
Do not tempt me.

01:52:55.320 --> 01:53:00.800
Her skin is white, and
I'm light as the sun.

01:53:00.800 --> 01:53:05.660
So holy light shines on
the things you have done.

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:09.400
The title of this poem comes

01:53:09.400 --> 01:53:14.990
from something a female
interrogator said to Mohammed.

01:53:14.990 --> 01:53:17.120
"Think of Me As Your Mother."

01:53:17.120 --> 01:53:24.100
It's the Ides of March, and
I have too much longing.

01:53:24.100 --> 01:53:27.840
Lions and gales replace speech.

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:32.380 position:56%
My mind breaks in a stone courtyard.

01:53:32.380 --> 01:53:36.330 position:56%
It echoes as if played from turrets.

01:53:36.330 --> 01:53:38.740
They admit me.

01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:43.050
They put my clothes in a bin and
search my skin for marks, cuts,

01:53:43.050 --> 01:53:49.660
and bruises, verify my eyes, hair,
toes, and knuckles are black.

01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:51.690
They remove the string
from my hoodie

01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:55.330
so I won't make a noose of it.

01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:59.070
I'm too tired to laugh about that.

01:53:59.070 --> 01:54:00.720
They offer me rice.

01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:05.020
They say, "The rice is
good," and watch my face.

01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:08.130
They think they know Africans.

01:54:08.130 --> 01:54:09.850
I say nothing.

01:54:09.850 --> 01:54:12.540
They give me medicine, two kinds.

01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:15.490
I get free and yell, "I'm black!

01:54:15.490 --> 01:54:16.790
I'm black!

01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:18.090
I'm black!

01:54:18.090 --> 01:54:19.620
I'm black!

01:54:19.620 --> 01:54:20.920
I'm black!

01:54:20.920 --> 01:54:22.220
I'm black!

01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:23.520
I'm black!

01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:24.820
I'm black!

01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:26.120
I'm black!

01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:27.420
I'm black!

01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:28.720
And I've never been to a wedding."

01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.260 position:56%
After the medicine, I keep seeing
my black and yelling, "What is that?

01:54:31.260 --> 01:54:32.560
What is that?

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:33.860
What is that?

01:54:33.860 --> 01:54:35.550
What is that?"

01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:37.450
They don't answer.

01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:42.520
A woman tells me to move it.

01:54:42.520 --> 01:54:46.950
She's pretending a toy
keyboard is a lie detector.

01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:51.370
I bumped her hands, and now
she has to start all over.

01:54:51.370 --> 01:54:56.290
After the medicine, I can see my
black, and it can't stop talking.

01:54:56.290 --> 01:54:58.900
It says, "I'm not a demon.

01:54:58.900 --> 01:55:00.730
I'm a ghost.

01:55:00.730 --> 01:55:04.330
They're doing the wrong
rituals on me."

01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:07.670
They took inventory of
my Keds, my Dickies,

01:55:07.670 --> 01:55:10.500
but I'm still found
without shoes or sheets.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:12.680
My chin stays bruised, and a sore

01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.350
in my mouth makes me remember my
wisdom tooth surgery when I was 17,

01:55:17.350 --> 01:55:19.750
and I had my first Muslim doctor,

01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:22.410
and he made a mistake
and gashed my cheek.

01:55:22.410 --> 01:55:24.660
And to keep from crying, he bid me

01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:27.850
to stop crying, even
though I wasn't.

01:55:27.850 --> 01:55:30.070
They'd given me cackling gas.

01:55:30.070 --> 01:55:32.880
He cooed, "Everything will be okay.

01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:34.920
Everything will be all right.

01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:36.920
Everything will be okay.

01:55:36.920 --> 01:55:39.640
Everything will be all right."

01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:45.100
I screeched, "I love myself,"
in my best Kendrick voice,

01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:47.340
spin like my feet are arabesque.

01:55:47.340 --> 01:55:48.640
They shoot me.

01:55:48.640 --> 01:55:53.400
After that medicine, I stop rapping
on tabletops and go to my bed.

01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:55.610
The mattress receives me.

01:55:55.610 --> 01:55:59.140 position:56%
I think of dark hair on a soft bely.

01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:01.640
The blanket hugs me.

01:56:01.640 --> 01:56:05.600
I think of my baby sister
sleeping on my mother's back.

01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:09.540
I stay in my bed all day
and miss all my prayers

01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:11.820
because the bed says yes and yes.

01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.520
I want it to say no.

01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:16.980
So it's yes and yes is real.

01:56:16.980 --> 01:56:20.800
Can you rape a bed
sleeping stubborn in it,

01:56:20.800 --> 01:56:24.840
even if its springs
tell you to get out?

01:56:24.840 --> 01:56:27.700
Tell my mother to bring
me some grease and my pick

01:56:27.700 --> 01:56:30.230
and to hide my hot hair
curler in her skirt.

01:56:30.230 --> 01:56:32.880
I already know my hair
better be laid when I lie

01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:37.660
in this therapist's face and
tell her, "I just got confused."

01:56:37.660 --> 01:56:41.090
They release me with
three brown paper bags.

01:56:41.090 --> 01:56:43.460
All their handles break.

01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:47.780
They want me to look crazy in
these streets, but I just hum Badu

01:56:47.780 --> 01:56:52.410
in the parking lot, and on the bus
break the high note, "Pack light."

01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:57.490
Every city built by the
water is way too turnt [sic],

01:56:57.490 --> 01:57:01.830
from Chicago to Istanbul, the
thin caterwaul of stray felines

01:57:01.830 --> 01:57:06.450
from mid-morning to dusk, the geese
that flew nowhere all winter holler

01:57:06.450 --> 01:57:10.100
in a knotted field
at a devilish hour.

01:57:10.100 --> 01:57:13.290
Then there are gunshots,
police cracking ribs.

01:57:13.290 --> 01:57:16.760
The volume is up too high,
too high in black ears.

01:57:16.760 --> 01:57:20.660
What do you do when a whole
city is dog whistling?

01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:25.110
A woman curses her young son.

01:57:25.110 --> 01:57:27.040
His blink is blank.

01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:29.590
They face each other hard-eyed.

01:57:29.590 --> 01:57:35.230
They have trouble translating
the Quran into English.

01:57:35.230 --> 01:57:39.270
Hell is the burning fire.

01:57:39.270 --> 01:57:44.290 position:56%
Hell is pain of mother losing child.

01:57:44.290 --> 01:57:49.530
In many places on Earth, both
definitions hold at the same time.

01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:54.810
I took my medicine, both kinds,
and don't yell out the window,

01:57:54.810 --> 01:57:58.770
"Rise like dust in
a Maya Angelou poem

01:57:58.770 --> 01:58:00.590 position:56%
and the voice of a kid reciting it."

01:58:00.590 --> 01:58:03.250
Rise like [inaudible]
concerts when they were tossed

01:58:03.250 --> 01:58:06.450
out the compound windows or
like [inaudible], or Mandela,

01:58:06.450 --> 01:58:08.610 position:56%
or anyone whose knees, or shoulders,

01:58:08.610 --> 01:58:12.350
or skulls were clubbed
in a dank prison.

01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:17.090
I wish I could take
you into my belly.

01:58:17.090 --> 01:58:21.180
I think it's the only
safe space for you.

01:58:21.180 --> 01:58:22.760
Come into my womb.

01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:25.660
You might find cinderblocks
and mixed metal.

01:58:25.660 --> 01:58:30.380
You might find teeth, and discrete
ejaculations, and rancid tears,

01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:34.520
and salvaged bits of scripture.

01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:38.960
Come into my placenta, my
electric water via dream submarine.

01:58:38.960 --> 01:58:41.300 position:56%
I will throw the key into the ocean.

01:58:41.300 --> 01:58:44.590
I am infinitely generative.

01:58:44.590 --> 01:58:47.900
You'll find your grandson
guarding you.

01:58:47.900 --> 01:58:51.710
When you're ready to leave,
he'll call to you, "All the best.

01:58:51.710 --> 01:58:54.120
Good-bye. Good-bye."

01:58:54.120 --> 01:58:55.920
Thank you.

01:58:55.920 --> 01:59:17.450
[ Applause ]

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:18.750
&gt;&gt; Hope Wabuke: Wow.

01:59:18.750 --> 01:59:20.420
It's always the worst
to have to read

01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:23.530
after Ladan Osman,
because she's amazing.

01:59:23.530 --> 01:59:25.230
She really, really is.

01:59:25.230 --> 01:59:31.240
I want to thank you to Kwame, and
Chris, and Matthew, and Aracelis,

01:59:31.240 --> 01:59:34.510
and Patricia, and Mary-Jane,
and Rob,

01:59:34.510 --> 01:59:37.720
and everybody at the African
Poetry Book Fund, and the Library

01:59:37.720 --> 01:59:43.360
of Congress for making this
wonderful event happen.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:47.050
Tsitsi said it really is like
being around family, and it is,

01:59:47.050 --> 01:59:49.340
just the work that everybody does.

01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:54.020
So I wanted to read a few poems
from my tract book "Believing,"

01:59:54.020 --> 02:00:00.810 position:56%
which ABPF published, which is an
excerpt from a large poem manuscript

02:00:00.810 --> 02:00:03.120
in progress, similar [inaudible]
called the "The Body Family,"

02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:08.340
which explores my family's escape
from Amin's genocide in 1976

02:00:08.340 --> 02:00:15.170
in Uganda, where he massacred
about 300,000 people and I'm lucky

02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:18.270
that my parents were
able to come to America.

02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:23.760
So it felt timely with
what's happening right now.

02:00:23.760 --> 02:00:27.390
The first one is called
"If Not David."

02:00:27.390 --> 02:00:31.380
When the British came, they
brought their guns and their Jesus.

02:00:31.380 --> 02:00:33.770
They took our oil and diamonds.

02:00:33.770 --> 02:00:36.970
They sent our men to fight
their wars in Europe,

02:00:36.970 --> 02:00:39.310
did not send the bodies home.

02:00:39.310 --> 02:00:40.610
Amin was 18.

02:00:40.610 --> 02:00:42.940
He learned his lesson well.

02:00:42.940 --> 02:00:44.330
Kill the other.

02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:46.430
Take what is his.

02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:48.890
When Amin and his cronies
drove the British out,

02:00:48.890 --> 02:00:53.730
our country in chaos,
those already ignore.

02:00:53.730 --> 02:00:59.270
At first his killings were called
a natural byproduct of events.

02:00:59.270 --> 02:01:02.870
His buddy Obote, the new
president, promoted him.

02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:05.100
Said, "Kill more."

02:01:05.100 --> 02:01:10.590
But later, when his killings grew
too much and Obote said, "Stop,"

02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:15.730
Amin went after him too,
took the throne, and laughed.

02:01:15.730 --> 02:01:20.520
"No one can run," he said,
"faster than a bullet."

02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:23.470
At times, so many dead
bodies were thrown

02:01:23.470 --> 02:01:26.960
into the Nile River the
water stopped flowing.

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:30.830
"Hitler," he was fond of
saying, "had the right idea."

02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:35.590
Can you hear me okay?

02:01:35.590 --> 02:01:41.510
Great. This next poem is called,
"Goliath," also about Amin.

02:01:41.510 --> 02:01:45.510
Names given, His Excellency Idi
Amin, the Butcher of Uganda,

02:01:45.510 --> 02:01:49.690
Conqueror of the British Empire in
Africa and Uganda in particular,

02:01:49.690 --> 02:01:54.880
Field Marshal Alhaji, Doctor,
Big Daddy, President for Life,

02:01:54.880 --> 02:01:58.690
Lord of all the beasts of the
Earth and fishes of the sea.

02:01:58.690 --> 02:02:00.320
Weight, 250.

02:02:00.320 --> 02:02:02.190
Height, 6-4.

02:02:02.190 --> 02:02:05.550
What his former British
commander said, "A splendid type,

02:02:05.550 --> 02:02:11.390
a good rugby player, and a reliable
soldier, cheerful, energetic,

02:02:11.390 --> 02:02:17.610
and an incredible person
who certainly isn't mad."

First instance of torture, 1962
Turkana Massacre, burying alive,

02:02:22.780 --> 02:02:26.170
beating to death, et
cetera, overlooked.

02:02:26.170 --> 02:02:30.240
Promoted to head of
armed forces, 1963.

02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.870
Awards, distinguished service
order, Victoria's Cross,

02:02:33.870 --> 02:02:36.640

Number of wives, four.

02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.140
Mistresses, 30.

02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:48.540
Abused, 34.

02:02:48.540 --> 02:02:53.010
Number of soldiers employed in
special death squads, 18,000.

02:02:53.010 --> 02:02:56.280
Number of villagers
wiped out, unknown.

02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:02.060
Kill count, 300,000,
or 1 in 26 people.

02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:06.370
Flees to Libya in 1979
after losing war

02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:09.990
with Tanzanian forces
and Ugandan dissidents.

02:03:09.990 --> 02:03:15.790
Motto, in any country, there
must be people who have to die.

02:03:15.790 --> 02:03:22.650
This one is called "Exodus,
Fathers, Americans Superheroes."

02:03:22.650 --> 02:03:27.290
Because certain death, because
genocide, he leads them out.

02:03:27.290 --> 02:03:31.920
He is Moses and Jeremiah
when no one else will try.

02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:34.110
The faith to move mountains and get

02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:38.790
to America keep them
secret, keep them safe.

02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:40.800
Raise up his body family.

02:03:40.800 --> 02:03:42.100
Begin again.

02:03:42.100 --> 02:03:45.550
This one's called "Mouth."

02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:48.280
They pack nothing to
escape detection.

02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.450
One change of clothes.

02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:53.750 position:56%
No books, furniture, or photographs.

02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:57.770
My father's lab specimens
are sewn into his pants.

02:03:57.770 --> 02:04:00.710
A day trip with our daughter,
they will say at the border.

02:04:00.710 --> 02:04:05.870
We will be right back.

02:04:05.870 --> 02:04:08.290
This one is "Breath."

02:04:08.290 --> 02:04:12.740
They never speak of the dead,
the massacres, at school.

02:04:12.740 --> 02:04:15.400
Friends and family disappeared.

02:04:15.400 --> 02:04:18.520
How they got word they were next.

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:22.290 position:56%
The crossing to Kenya, then America.

02:04:22.290 --> 02:04:26.820
What happened to those left behind?

02:04:26.820 --> 02:04:31.970
This poem is called "Numbers."

02:04:31.970 --> 02:04:34.560
Mother makes the doll
after their baby boy

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:37.680
who would have been
my older brother dies.

02:04:37.680 --> 02:04:42.000
She sews his bits of curly black
hair on top, pricks his finger

02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:46.940
with her needles, paints his
blood on the cotton-stuffed face.

02:04:46.940 --> 02:04:53.420 position:56%
Two circles for eyes, two lines for
nose and mouth, and she is finished.

02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:57.890
All the time father is away,
she will hold baby boy doll

02:04:57.890 --> 02:05:01.310
and hum the many melodies
she learned to sing

02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:05.000
when a hospital nurse
back home in Amin's war

02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.090
to the skin-thin shivering
rib caged infants,

02:05:09.090 --> 02:05:14.660
tiny orphaned fists flailing
to eat their last bit of feces

02:05:14.660 --> 02:05:17.800
that would not keep
them alive another day.

02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:22.330 position:56%
The lightness of their bodies in
her arms, no heavier than the breath

02:05:22.330 --> 02:05:24.720
of air that was her song.

02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:30.270 position:56%
And that one came from a dream I had
when I was pregnant with my own son

02:05:30.270 --> 02:05:33.060
and I began to have all these
memories I couldn't know

02:05:33.060 --> 02:05:34.360
and that was one of them.

02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.360
And I called my mom and I
said, "Did you tell this to me

02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:39.510
about being a nurse and
the babies, orphans,

02:05:39.510 --> 02:05:42.510
newborns not having enough milk
because their parents were dead

02:05:42.510 --> 02:05:44.260
and them dying of hunger?"

02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:45.560
And she said, "No.

02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:46.860
I didn't tell that you."

02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:48.160
But somehow, that memory came up

02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:50.850
and that fascinates me,
that cultural memory.

02:05:50.850 --> 02:05:53.150
So this one's called "The Nerve."

02:05:53.150 --> 02:05:57.290
I've never read this one before
aloud, but, again, it seemed timely

02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:59.790
to be here in this
town, in this place,

02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:01.950
at this time and read this poem.

02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:03.300
So it's a little long.

02:06:03.300 --> 02:06:07.530
So bear with me and I'll just
read two more after this.

02:06:07.530 --> 02:06:09.490
"The Nerve."

02:06:09.490 --> 02:06:11.180
When I was a little girl, you

02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:13.900
and I were the best of
friends, dear father.

02:06:13.900 --> 02:06:17.290
As I followed you down the
long test tube flanked aisles

02:06:17.290 --> 02:06:20.560
of your laboratory
funded by the same people

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.800
who had enslaved your grandparents
and bankrupted your country

02:06:24.800 --> 02:06:27.970
and would deny them the
medicines you were discovering,

02:06:27.970 --> 02:06:32.880 position:56%
still following you in stores, still
sending cops to watch our house,

02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:35.470
because those niggers have been
up to no good since we moved

02:06:35.470 --> 02:06:40.400
to our town, I wanted to know why
and wrote down everything you said

02:06:40.400 --> 02:06:45.830
as truth until I began to think for
myself and you couldn't have that.

02:06:45.830 --> 02:06:49.570
So you began to beat at me
like a housewife does a stain,

02:06:49.570 --> 02:06:53.250
as if that would get
the education out.

02:06:53.250 --> 02:06:56.580
The doctors have said you will
spend this year dying and I want

02:06:56.580 --> 02:06:58.560
to tell you so many things.

02:06:58.560 --> 02:07:00.840
But yesterday, they
let free that white man

02:07:00.840 --> 02:07:04.630
who killed a little brown
boy just because he was brown

02:07:04.630 --> 02:07:07.410
and the day before that, they
took away our right to vote

02:07:07.410 --> 02:07:08.870
and the day before that,

02:07:08.870 --> 02:07:11.160
they released a study
saying the radiation

02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:15.240
from a nuclear disaster exploded
in Japan has already jumped

02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:19.820 position:56%
in the water, swum across the ocean,
up through our faucets, our hoses,

02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:22.480 position:56%
into our earth, plants, and animals,

02:07:22.480 --> 02:07:25.520
our bodies now dying,
infected already.

02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:29.380
And there is not enough medicine
for everyone and you know

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:32.730
who there will not be enough for.

02:07:32.730 --> 02:07:37.460
This morning I had to stop while
doing my yoga and curl into a ball,

02:07:37.460 --> 02:07:40.030
hold myself to keep from shaking.

02:07:40.030 --> 02:07:43.050
All day long, I felt terrified.

02:07:43.050 --> 02:07:46.960
Little spasms down my spine
and central nervous system.

02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:49.910
As I remember taking
my seven-month-old son

02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:55.700
for our daily walk because he loves
outside, outside, and I love him,

02:07:55.700 --> 02:07:58.150
walking with him pressed
against my body,

02:07:58.150 --> 02:08:03.400
still feeling my bones realigning,
muscles unwinding from giving birth

02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:07.790
to him, carrying him, and the old
white man who lives in the house

02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:10.320
on the corner yelling
he would shoot us

02:08:10.320 --> 02:08:14.830
like that other white man had
the other little brown boy just

02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:16.800
because we are brown too.

02:08:16.800 --> 02:08:19.490
And all I could think was breathe.

02:08:19.490 --> 02:08:24.050
Breathe. There are
people's small horrors too.

02:08:24.050 --> 02:08:28.140
A friend who was trying to get
pregnant, another miscarriage,

02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:30.180
says it feels like meeting a ghost

02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:33.520
without ever having
met the person before.

02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:37.110
And I just want you, my
father, to protect me,

02:08:37.110 --> 02:08:41.360
teach me how to protect my son,
because they have put in a law

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:46.130
that says the last man standing can
say, "I felt threatened," and shoot

02:08:46.130 --> 02:08:48.690
to kill and then walk free.

02:08:48.690 --> 02:08:52.600
And they always say they
are threatened by us

02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:55.820
and they have taken away the other
law that says they cannot stop

02:08:55.820 --> 02:08:57.390
in front of our path --

02:08:57.390 --> 02:09:01.370
step in front of our path to
the voting house and stop us.

02:09:01.370 --> 02:09:05.140
And they have never
stopped trying to stop us.

02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:08.360
And I wonder what is to
stop them from firing,

02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:12.760 position:56%
knowing their whiteness is their
ticket to not guilty, to be set free

02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:17.720
of having to feel their rage of
having a man who looks like you

02:09:17.720 --> 02:09:20.350
in their White House again.

02:09:28.410 --> 02:09:32.060
This one is called "Refugee Minds."

02:09:32.060 --> 02:09:36.270
And my son had [inaudible]
one of his little friends

02:09:36.270 --> 02:09:39.640
and we was talking to her
mom and she was telling me

02:09:39.640 --> 02:09:42.590
about the banyan tree that grows
in Hawaii and I never heard of it

02:09:42.590 --> 02:09:46.320
and it's the tree that grows up
and then its roots and limbs,

02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:48.920
instead of going outward,
grow back down into the ground

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:50.360
and then it grows up again.

02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:54.320
And that image stuck with me
and said exactly what I needed.

02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:57.560
So I have to thank my son for
choosing really wonderful friends

02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.680
who have really wonderful
moms who give me poems.

02:10:01.680 --> 02:10:04.070
So "Refugee Minds."

02:10:04.070 --> 02:10:08.320
They thought believing would
be like the banyan tree rising

02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:14.700 position:56%
to spread wide, branches turned down
become root again, grow new life.

02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:18.300
But there is work that must
be done to connect deep

02:10:18.300 --> 02:10:21.390
and strong inside alien ground.

02:10:21.390 --> 02:10:23.180
You must speak.

02:10:23.180 --> 02:10:26.960
You must let yourself be
known by these new children

02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:31.190
and all your glorious
tangled mess of becoming.

02:10:31.190 --> 02:10:33.140
Your culture also.

02:10:33.140 --> 02:10:34.440
Burrow down deep in this.

02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:39.980
Else for there are
always storms coming.

02:10:39.980 --> 02:10:42.950
Rootless, apart, you break.

02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:49.050
And my last two poems, very
quickly, this one is "Naomi."

02:10:50.710 --> 02:10:53.760
When grandmother listens,
my mouth is alien,

02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:57.260
foreign waters lapping
at a foreign shore.

02:10:57.260 --> 02:11:00.850
I have only the language
of her conquerors

02:11:00.850 --> 02:11:04.210
within just one small island.

02:11:04.210 --> 02:11:11.470
Kuhu [assumed spelling], Kuhu,
her name repeated become a song.

02:11:11.470 --> 02:11:16.350
And my last poem I wanted to read
for you, "Slow Dance with Bullet."

02:11:16.350 --> 02:11:19.260
Again, felt like I'm here
in this town so I needed

02:11:19.260 --> 02:11:22.060
to read this poem to you.

02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:24.250
"Slow Dance with Bullet."

02:11:24.250 --> 02:11:27.090
This is when you become political.

02:11:27.090 --> 02:11:31.650
This unarmed black boy shot,
this white killer cop not charge,

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:35.790
but given three months paid
vacation, plus $1 million

02:11:35.790 --> 02:11:38.690
in thanks for this job well done.

02:11:38.690 --> 02:11:42.250
This happened yesterday,
too, the day before that.

02:11:42.250 --> 02:11:45.590
They used to say this,
"Dance, nigger, dance,

02:11:45.590 --> 02:11:48.190
and empty their guns laughing."

02:11:48.190 --> 02:11:50.040
This was their theory.

02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:54.560
If you can rise fast enough, the
bullets would not hit your feet.

02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:59.720
This, the weight of five centuries
that did not break your back.

02:11:59.720 --> 02:12:01.780
This, you are scared of, then.

02:12:01.780 --> 02:12:05.390
This, you stiffen silent and bored.

02:12:05.390 --> 02:12:08.890
This will happen again
tomorrow, different city,

02:12:08.890 --> 02:12:13.680
different dead black boy body,
but now, the straw needle.

02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:17.750
Oh, how your baby boy
loves to dance.

02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:20.060
His legs, though, are little.

02:12:20.060 --> 02:12:21.680
He could never jump enough.

02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:24.510
Thank you so much.

02:12:24.510 --> 02:12:35.470
[ Applause ]

02:12:35.470 --> 02:12:37.510
&gt;&gt; Let's just hear it for
all the poets who read.

02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:46.220
[ Applause ]

02:12:46.220 --> 02:12:49.480
I just want to name a few people
that -- we do all this work,

02:12:49.480 --> 02:12:51.720
we publish this work, but, frankly,

02:12:51.720 --> 02:12:54.170
the funding to make
this happen has come

02:12:54.170 --> 02:12:57.380
through a most generous benefactor,

02:12:57.380 --> 02:12:59.760
Laura and Robert Silaman
[assumed spelling]

02:12:59.760 --> 02:13:03.220
and they've been incredibly
generous and supportive,

02:13:03.220 --> 02:13:05.340
and that's how we are able to pay

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.570
for these publications
and these books.

02:13:07.570 --> 02:13:10.280
So it takes money and it
takes the support of them.

02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.980
I also must mention
Ashley Strosnider.

02:13:12.980 --> 02:13:16.050
Ashley is the managing editor
for this series and, of course,

02:13:16.050 --> 02:13:18.280
with Prairie Schooner,
and Ashley's over there.

02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:19.580
She runs things.

02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:24.150
Ashley is fantastic,
amazing, and is Paul here?

02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:27.720
Paul is our Web editor for Prairie
Schooner, but also the Web editor

02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:30.460
for APBF and he's been doing
amazing work and so on.

02:13:30.460 --> 02:13:35.340
I want to say that the University
of Nebraska Press, the publishers

02:13:35.340 --> 02:13:37.140
for many of our books
and [inaudible] books.

02:13:37.140 --> 02:13:39.260
They are publishers
for many of our books.

02:13:39.260 --> 02:13:43.280
We have a partner in Senegal called
Amalian [assumed spelling] Books.

02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:45.110
And then, of course, we've worked

02:13:45.110 --> 02:13:47.480
with Slapering Hol Press
for the first box set.

02:13:47.480 --> 02:13:48.780
So that's been fantastic.

02:13:48.780 --> 02:13:52.070
We've had -- all our book
covers are by African artists.

02:13:52.070 --> 02:13:55.330
So we celebrate African
art in exciting ways.

02:13:55.330 --> 02:13:58.260
We're working on other
partnerships that I can mention.

02:13:58.260 --> 02:14:01.910
For instance, we've got support
from Ford and, of course,

02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:04.300
we are getting started
to have a conversation

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:06.330 position:56%
with the African Center in New York.

02:14:06.330 --> 02:14:08.320 position:56%
So a lot of exciting things going on

02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:09.910
and we want you to
keep supporting us.

02:14:09.910 --> 02:14:14.040
Right? You know, buy the books
and tell people about it and --

02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:16.700
for me, it's all about
this writing, isn't it?

02:14:16.700 --> 02:14:20.130
It's beautiful and that's why we
are really pleased to do this.

02:14:20.130 --> 02:14:23.570
So I thank the folks here
at the Library of Congress.

02:14:23.570 --> 02:14:29.440 position:56%
Hope we didn't cause too much
trouble and thank you for having us.

02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:31.240
Okay.

02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:42.080
[ Applause ]

02:14:42.080 --> 02:14:45.040
&gt;&gt; So, again, thank you.

02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:47.520
Thanks for this fantastic program.

02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:50.080
When I was on the phone with
Quami Warding [assumed spelling],

02:14:50.080 --> 02:14:54.440 position:56%
he told me everything would be
fine, everything would be wonderful,

02:14:54.440 --> 02:14:56.140
and he was absolutely right.

02:14:56.140 --> 02:15:00.440
There was absolutely no
reason for me to fret.

02:15:00.440 --> 02:15:02.490
Now, I would like to first

02:15:02.490 --> 02:15:08.100

wonderful, wonderful poets,

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:12.790
and thank you Kwame, thank
you Chris, thank you Matthew.

02:15:12.790 --> 02:15:14.090
Thank you, Aracelis.

02:15:14.090 --> 02:15:16.760
You've been all fantastic.

02:15:16.760 --> 02:15:18.410
And now, I want to invite you.

02:15:18.410 --> 02:15:24.910 position:56%
