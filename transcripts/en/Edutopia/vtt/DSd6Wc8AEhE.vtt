00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:14.626
&gt;&gt;Holly: The objectives for this
lesson are to understand the concepts

00:00:14.626 --> 00:00:17.026
of water scarcity and
water shortages.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:18.386
&gt;&gt;I'm Holly Mortimer.

00:00:18.386 --> 00:00:21.666
I live in Boise, Idaho, and
I teach high school online

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:25.326
for three different schools,
and I work from home.

00:00:25.376 --> 00:00:32.996
&gt;&gt;I get up about 6:45, 7:00, and
I make coffee and get my son up

00:00:32.996 --> 00:00:36.976
and get him going, get him
ready and then start working.

00:00:36.976 --> 00:00:39.316
&gt;&gt;Hey, Beckett, you need to go
play somewhere else right now.

00:00:39.996 --> 00:00:40.646
Thank you.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:46.276
&gt;&gt;I usually start with a school and
I respond to all my e-mail, grade,

00:00:46.816 --> 00:00:50.516
prep for a lesson, and the other
thing that I kind of struggle

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:53.706
with is the days when you're all of
a sudden like, "It's five to three

00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.986
and I'm still in my pajamas and
I haven't brushed my teeth yet."

00:00:57.946 --> 00:00:59.606
&gt;&gt;So we start Module 8 this week.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.746
&gt;&gt;So I have a broad
range of students.

00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.766
I have some athletes, kids who
weren't in school last year,

00:01:05.906 --> 00:01:07.416
students who are at risk.

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:09.106
&gt;&gt;And I want you to draw a line

00:01:09.226 --> 00:01:12.146
to how much water you think
it takes to produce that item.

00:01:12.296 --> 00:01:16.646
&gt;&gt;The key shift for an online
teacher is to go from the paradigm

00:01:16.646 --> 00:01:19.876
of thinking about what you're
going to teach and how you're going

00:01:19.876 --> 00:01:23.176
to teach it to, what
are the kids learning

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.926
and how are they not learning
and how are they not engaged?

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:30.406
It totally shifts from the
content to the student.

00:01:30.936 --> 00:01:32.206
&gt;&gt;Jessie, it looks
like you're typing.

00:01:32.206 --> 00:01:34.096
Do you have a question?

00:01:34.096 --> 00:01:38.376
&gt;&gt;The way that you engage the
kids is by prompt feedback.

00:01:38.376 --> 00:01:40.286
When they reach out to
you, you got to grab them.

00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:43.906
At iSucceed, we have a pretty high
expectation for rapid turnaround

00:01:43.906 --> 00:01:47.496
of grading, and they quickly become
really kind of addicted to that,

00:01:47.496 --> 00:01:52.436
so super-prompt response when they
reach out, immediate if you can,

00:01:52.536 --> 00:01:54.186
definitely within 24 hours.

00:01:54.186 --> 00:01:57.186
I mean, that's how you are
there in the classroom,

00:01:57.186 --> 00:02:00.496
and if you're not responding
promptly, they just feel

00:02:00.496 --> 00:02:01.576
like they're in the wilderness.

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:05.696
&gt;&gt;So you should be seeing
an MP4 file loading,

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:07.356
and I'll put the link in the chat.

00:02:07.646 --> 00:02:11.866
&gt;&gt;As an online teacher, your level
of accountability is much higher.

00:02:12.206 --> 00:02:15.696
You're not only accountable at
the end of every testing cycle.

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:18.456
We have different grade
metrics, lots of different ways

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:22.416
that we measure them, and there's
a lot of data, a lot of data.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:27.896
From my perspective, I kind of have
a bring-it-on attitude to that.

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:30.166
&gt;&gt;The key is not how
much water there is

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:32.556
but that it's predictable,
so in some places of...

00:02:32.556 --> 00:02:38.316
&gt;&gt;If really what you love about
teaching is creating curriculum,

00:02:38.386 --> 00:02:43.026
displays in your classroom,
designing lessons, designing tests

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:45.686
or assessments, it's
not the place for you,

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:49.656
because that is what
has been done for you.

00:02:49.656 --> 00:02:52.106
&gt;&gt;Well, I think I would
put it into a chart.

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:57.196
&gt;&gt;But if you're the person who really
enjoys kind of the encouragement,

00:02:57.196 --> 00:03:00.536
the "come on, I know you can do
this," the cheerleading aspect

00:03:00.536 --> 00:03:02.096
of teaching, working
with the student,

00:03:02.096 --> 00:03:04.116
really seeing clearly
their progress...

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:04.306
&gt;&gt;Good.

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:07.426
&gt;&gt;And being really
involved with the students,

00:03:07.616 --> 00:03:10.216
then it's a great choice, because
that's what you'll be doing.

00:03:11.806 --> 00:03:16.606
I think if there's an isolation
professionally, it's counterweighted

00:03:16.606 --> 00:03:19.956
with the opposite of
isolation for my family,

00:03:19.956 --> 00:03:23.626
because I'm always here,
so I see my husband.

00:03:23.716 --> 00:03:25.726
We have lunch almost every day.

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:30.286
We're just all more present
together, so I'm less isolated

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:34.976
from my family, and
it makes up for it.

00:03:35.046 --> 00:03:36.406
