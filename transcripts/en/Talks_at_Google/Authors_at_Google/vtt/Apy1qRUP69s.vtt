JORDAN THIBODEAU: So we're
going talk to Matt and Amanda

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.590
about the book.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.970
And then we're going to work
in some of your questions.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.290
So my first question
was, what inspired

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.960
you to write this book?

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.595
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Well,
I think it was really,

00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:18.940
I've been in the industry
for 18 years now.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.050
She's been in it about 16.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.144
And so over the
years you obviously

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:24.060
hear a lot of stories.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.309
You experience a lot of
things with different clients.

00:00:26.309 --> 00:00:29.700
But 95% of our clients are
in the real estate industry.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.010
And so it was kind of a--
when you hear the recurring

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.140
stories, the recurring
mistakes, the lessons

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.840
that people need to learn, it
just seemed like a great avenue

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.760
to put them together and do
it in a way that it was fun.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.270
Obviously taxes aren't
the most exciting topic,

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.500
and I congratulate you all
for sitting here after lunch,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.530
listening to a tax talk.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.780
So good for that.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.105
But I think it was a good way
for us to do it in a fun way,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:03.680
teach people some lessons that
can reach a lot of people, not

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.010
just our clientele, per se.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.510
But I think that was one of the
motivating reasons for doing

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.610
it.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.980
JORDAN THIBODEAU: One question
Googlers ask me is what can you

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.470
and what can't
you deduct things?

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.010
And so people say, can
I write off my kids

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:19.440
for my real estate business?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.244
Not can I write my kids
off emotionally, but more

00:01:22.244 --> 00:01:23.660
on the real estate
side of things?

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.540
[LAUGHS]

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.250
So maybe you can go over
some of the common deductions

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.977
that real estate investors miss.

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:31.560
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, I think one
of the main things to understand

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.910
is that anything potentially
could be tax deductible.

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.870
So the question you ask yourself
is if you're spending money

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.670
on something, is it
ordinary and necessary

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.300
for my real estate business?

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.960
So some of the most
commonly missed

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.770
ones would be like car expenses,
travel costs, cellphones,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.500
computers.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.270
These are things that we all
use on a day-to-day basis

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.970
personally, but we also use it
to help us in our real estate.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.460
So there's a common
myth out there

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.920
that we can't deduct
any of these things

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.640
unless we have a legal entity.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.810
So that's a question
we get all the time.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.110
Do I have to have an LLC
to deduct certain things?

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.509
Fortunately, the answer is no.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.150
The IRS doesn't really care
whether you have an entity

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.990
or not.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.130
What they care about is
whether you have a business.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.750
And business really
just means do I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.270
have an intent to make profit?

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.850
In our example, it's the
real estate business.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.580
So that's probably,
like you said,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.780
the most common question--
what can I deduct?

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.070
It's hard to say.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.640
What you can't deduct
would be things

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.270
that are more not necessary
for your real estate business.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.020
So as an example for
a lot of our clients,

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.900
we have a list of
100 tax deductions.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.900
It's a little checklist.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.510
Of course, that's not going
to apply to everybody.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.850
Not all 100 items will be
applicable to your real estate

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.260
business.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.525
But the key is to learn to
think about it from a more

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:52.400
creative perspective.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.024
And I know all Googlers are
very creative in nature.

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:58.440
So the question to ask yourself
when you're spending money

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.410
on something is how can I make
this ordinary and necessary

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.678
for my particular
real estate business?

00:03:04.678 --> 00:03:05.844
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:03:05.844 --> 00:03:09.550
Now, for people who don't have
an investment property, yet

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:12.660
they're going out to
scout for property,

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.880
can we write those expenses off?

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.940
And do we have to write
them off the same year we

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.690
find the property?

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.589
Or is there a way to hold onto
those for a couple years or so?

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:23.630
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: It's
a good question, and one

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.860
that we do get a lot.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.549
So if you are looking
for your first property,

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.340
you are going to incur
expenses to do that.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.880
You're going to incur travel.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.380
Maybe you're putting some
expenses down for property,

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.710
to do an inspection
or appraisal, whatever

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.770
it might be.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.750
If it's your first property
that you're buying,

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.482
all those
preaquisition costs are

00:03:45.482 --> 00:03:46.690
going to get lumped together.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.200
It's generally what's considered
startup costs of your business.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.350
And startup costs, you
can write off up to $5,000

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.840
right away, once you
"start" business.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.650
So with an investment
property, easiest way

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.358
to think about it when
you start business

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:03.450
is when you actually close on
the purchase of the property.

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.210
So at that point
in time, if you've

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.590
incurred less than $5,000,
you can write them off all

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.320
right away.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.820
If you've incurred
more than $5,000,

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:11.470
you take 5,000 right away.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
And the rest you can
write off over 15 years.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.620
15 years is a long
time, obviously.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.839
Not a great answer,
and most people

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:19.500
want to write things
off right away.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.025
But that's kind of the way
that the tax law looks at it.

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:24.650
AMANDA HAN: Yeah,
and I think something

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.980
to add-- if you think about it,
what the IRS is really doing

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.140
is they're incentivizing
us to pull the trigger,

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.280
and invest sooner
rather than later.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.859
Right?

00:04:33.859 --> 00:04:34.900
So they're rewarding you.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.233
If you're spending money to
learn how to do real estate,

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:39.080
you're traveling to
look at real estate,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.590
really the deduction comes
in once you start investing.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.800
So the earlier you
start investing,

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.341
the better the tax deduction.

00:04:46.341 --> 00:04:47.840
On the other hand,
if you're someone

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:51.010
who's been taking classes, it's
been years and years and years

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.090
and still haven't really
pulled the trigger yet,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.500
those items still could
be tax deductible.

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.070
But it's just going to be
delayed into the future when

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:59.888
you actually pull the trigger.

00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:01.250
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.730
One thing I struggle with is
when I go on scouting trips.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.870
I have all of these receipts and
it's just very time consuming,

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.870
writing all these receipts
down and putting them

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:10.880
in the right Excel spreadsheets.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.982
How do you guys manage that?

00:05:13.982 --> 00:05:16.315
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: A lot of
our clients use Quickbooks.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:20.520
It's very popular
accounting software.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.010
We like to say,
it's good and bad.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.870
It's good because
it's very easy to use.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:26.210
And it's bad for us, because
it's very easy for you guys

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.510
to use it, depending on how
well a person utilizes it.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.510
But it can make things easier.

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.570
One of the things that
we learned from a mentor

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.110
early on was to
hire an assistant.

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.600
You know, and it might seem
kind of like a crazy idea

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.110
for you, if you're just
starting investing.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.370
But it can be a virtual
assistant, someone like that.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.130
AMANDA HAN: Or it
could be your kid,

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:46.350
like what Jordan said earlier.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:48.580
If you want to hire your kids
to help with your real estate

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.420
business, what a great
person to help you

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.937
scan receipts and do data entry.

00:05:51.937 --> 00:05:53.770
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: And
that's a good point.

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.010
The IRS, they don't
need to see paper.

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.100
So you can scan a receipt
and toss the receipt.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.740
So scanning and organizing,
however it makes sense for you,

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.180
whether it's file
holders or on the cloud

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.050
or whatever it is, just find
something that works for you.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.780
But you just need to be able
to find the receipt if you ever

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.080
need it.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:17.340
So I think that's some
big good tips that we've

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.164
talked to our clients about.

00:06:19.164 --> 00:06:20.330
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:23.520
Now, you guys are
practicing CPAs.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.470
So I was lucky to
come across you guys

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.000
through bigger pockets.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.050
But then I get asked
through the Google alias,

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:33.440
how do I go about
finding a good CPA?

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.065
How do I judge if the CPA
can work with real estate

00:06:36.065 --> 00:06:36.565
investors?

00:06:36.565 --> 00:06:38.400
Do you have any
tips you can share,

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.342
help us identify good CPAs?

00:06:41.342 --> 00:06:43.050
AMANDA HAN: I think
your local community.

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.758
So if you're an
investor, you're probably

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:46.360
networking with other investors.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.910
So it's a good idea to ask
who other people are using?

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:52.910
What's been their experience
in working with CPAs?

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.490
In the interview, ask them
questions about real estate.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.459
What are you seeing
with your other clients?

00:06:58.459 --> 00:07:00.500
What are your other clients
doing in real estate?

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.120
Do they have issues
with obtaining financing

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.290
or obtaining deals?

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:06.660
So that will help you
gauge you know how involved

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:07.770
they are in real estate.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.390
I know a lot of real
estate investors

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:12.430
are very creative, so doing
a lot of creative deals

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.605
with a lot of
creative terminology.

00:07:14.605 --> 00:07:15.980
So you just want
to make sure you

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.590
work with someone who
understands the terminology

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:19.510
you're talking about.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.450
So if you're doing
a lease option,

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.770
and you're talking to them and
you get really glazed look,

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:27.010
that's probably a
sign that you're not

00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.387
talking to the right person.

00:07:28.387 --> 00:07:30.220
Because they're supposed
to be your adviser.

00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:32.490
So just things like
that, talking to them,

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.410
getting to know how
much they really

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.950
understand your industry.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.190
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: And I think
just like doctors or attorneys,

00:07:41.190 --> 00:07:43.498
not all accountants
are great and equal

00:07:43.498 --> 00:07:44.910
or do the exact same thing.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:46.580
So just because
someone's a CPA and does

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:51.360
taxes doesn't mean they do
taxes for real estate investors.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.370
So obviously that can
be question number one,

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.344
and then dig into other
further questions.

00:07:56.344 --> 00:07:58.010
Because we see that
time and time again,

00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:59.700
where people have
hired somebody who

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.560
just doesn't have experience
with real estate, and things

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:02.059
are missed.

00:08:02.059 --> 00:08:03.680
And sometimes you can fix it.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.732
Sometimes you can't.

00:08:04.732 --> 00:08:06.650
So it can create
issues down the road.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.590
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, and
believe it or not,

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:09.360
we actually have a
handful of clients

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.800
who are CPAs themselves.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:15.910
They do taxes, maybe for
manufacturing or R&amp;D stuff.

00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:17.530
And then they have
us do consulting,

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:19.340
or we actually do the
tax returns for all

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.700
their real estate things.

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.360
So it's perfectly
fine if you have

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.380
lots of different
things going on, just

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.084
to make sure you're speaking
with the right person.

00:08:28.084 --> 00:08:30.500
The thing that is the funniest
to me, I hear all the time,

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.260
is people will call me and
say, oh, you know, I heard

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.740
about this particular strategy.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:36.520
And I say, where did
you hear that from?

00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:38.633
And they'll say, oh, I
heard it from my realtor.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.049
So that's not what
you want to do.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.289
You don't want to be taking
tax advice from your realtor

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:44.462
or your dentist.

00:08:44.462 --> 00:08:46.420
JORDAN THIBODEAU: What
are some common mistakes

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.310
that CPAs make in
the tax field when

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:50.777
they're working our returns?

00:08:50.777 --> 00:08:53.110
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: I think
with respect to real estate,

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:55.810
believe it or not, one of the
biggest ones that we see missed

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:57.790
is depreciation.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:00.920
So for those of you who may be
new to real estate investing,

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.590
depreciation is you buy a
property, just like a stock.

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:07.090
You don't necessarily get to
deduct the property right away.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:08.370
You've got to write
it off over time.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:10.130
And you do that
through depreciation.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.160
So it's kind of a paper expense.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.350
You get a certain
amount every year.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:17.050
Now, for us, who does real
estate tax stuff all the time,

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.840
it's kind of like
real estate 101.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.290
But 10%, 15% of
the time we see it

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.270
either done wrong, or believe
it or not, totally just not

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.890
taken at all.

00:09:27.890 --> 00:09:30.266
We had a client a couple
years back that had,

00:09:30.266 --> 00:09:31.640
I don't know, a
dozen properties.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.590
She'd owned them for
10, 12, 15 years.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:35.965
And you look at her return,
she hadn't taken depreciation

00:09:35.965 --> 00:09:38.034
on any of them over the years.

00:09:38.034 --> 00:09:39.450
So the benefit of
the depreciation

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:41.252
is that it's an
expense you can deduct

00:09:41.252 --> 00:09:43.460
against your other income
from the rental properties.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:46.640
So maybe you had
cash flow positive.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.390
But with the depreciation,
you're at zero.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.520
Or maybe you're even a loss
on your rental property

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.680
for tax purposes, which
could be a good thing.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.110
And this person has missed
out for 10 or 12 years.

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.090
So luckily there was a
way we could help her.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:10:01.162
But it was just mind blowing
when you look at it, that you

00:10:01.162 --> 00:10:02.400
haven't been doing this.

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.940
You're a real estate investor
and working with somebody,

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.932
haven't done this for so long.

00:10:06.932 --> 00:10:08.890
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, I think
another thing-- maybe

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:12.780
not a mistake per se-- but
I think a lot of accountants

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.530
or most accountants are
not creative by nature.

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.670
So we're more critical thinking.

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.380
And so I think a
really good practice

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:28.400
to get into-- when you
meet with your tax advisor,

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:32.020
instead of asking them-- like
you were saying earlier-- can I

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:33.030
write off my kids?

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.280
Can I write off my kids?

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.630
Can I write of this
particular purchase?

00:10:37.630 --> 00:10:40.590
Maybe the immediate answer
is no, you can't do it.

00:10:40.590 --> 00:10:42.630
But instead,
rephrase the question

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:45.340
to ask, how can I
write off my kids?

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:46.162
How can I do it?

00:10:46.162 --> 00:10:48.620
Well, maybe you can have your
kids help in your real estate

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:49.430
business.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.650
How can I write off
my trip to Florida?

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:55.320
Well maybe you can have
some pre-determined business

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:58.930
meetings, schedule things with
local real estate investors

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.410
or potential lenders
working in your deals.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:05.370
So just adding that one
simple word, I think really

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.660
helps a lot when you're
meeting with your tax advisor,

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.359
to put them in that
more creative thinking.

00:11:10.359 --> 00:11:12.650
And it's funny because I tell
people this all the time,

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:13.880
and it's interesting.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.137
Because sometimes I have clients
that throw this back to me.

00:11:17.137 --> 00:11:18.720
I was talking to
someone the other day

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.875
because they had a
big legal expense.

00:11:19.875 --> 00:11:20.700
This is personal stuff.

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:21.366
Can I deduct it?

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:22.290
And I said, no.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:23.665
And he's like,
well, the question

00:11:23.665 --> 00:11:24.645
is how can I deduct it?

00:11:24.645 --> 00:11:26.830
So then it was a completely
different conversation.

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.240
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.230
So you had a story in
your book about Jeff,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:34.110
about him creating the entities.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:36.150
Can you talk about
that story and then

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:39.134
go into common pitfalls
people find themselves

00:11:39.134 --> 00:11:41.550
in regarding setting up entities
in real estate investing?

00:11:41.550 --> 00:11:42.530
AMANDA HAN: Sure.

00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:44.260
I'll let you do that then.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.800
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Well, let's say,

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.520
Jeff is somebody, kind
of a newbie investor.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.750
And I'm trying to
recall the facts to a T.

00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.640
But I think he lost
his job, right?

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:01.370
And he was getting
into real estate

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.359
and going to different
seminars, educating himself,

00:12:04.359 --> 00:12:05.150
which is important.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.450
It's a good practice to be in.

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:10.710
But he got to the point where
he was going to these things

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:13.050
and he was forking
over thousands

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.817
of dollars on education and/or
creating legal entities.

00:12:16.817 --> 00:12:18.650
One of those-- I don't
know if you guys have

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.650
been to educational events
like that, where it's

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.270
the run to the back of the
room for the next five minutes,

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.440
and you get this great deal.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.890
And you can create 10 entities.

00:12:25.890 --> 00:12:28.840
And you know, circle the
wagons or whatever it is.

00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.350
So he did something like that,
where at the end of the day,

00:12:32.350 --> 00:12:34.302
he was in $10,000?

00:12:34.302 --> 00:12:38.485
He was $10,000 in with
four new entities.

00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:41.358
And when you look back, he
didn't have a single property

00:12:41.358 --> 00:12:42.324
yet.

00:12:42.324 --> 00:12:43.990
AMANDA HAN: So one
of the issues that he

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:46.390
asked is what is our fee
for doing tax returns?

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:49.040
Because we met him at a
local real estate club.

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.510
And so I was really
excited when he

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:52.190
was telling me about all
these different entities.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:54.080
I was like, well,
how many properties?

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.370
What are we talking about?

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:57.940
And that's when we learned he
didn't have any properties.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:59.773
And so that's the part
that's very alarming.

00:12:59.773 --> 00:13:02.510
And I think just touching on
a common mistake for people

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.260
starting out-- you do
want to have your entities

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.920
and your strategies in place.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.200
But you don't
necessarily always need

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:15.340
to be pulling the trigger
on entity formation, per se.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.790
So as an example, if you
have no properties yet,

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.480
keep track of your expenses.

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.560
They will become tax
deductible when you do

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.940
start investing in real estate.

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:25.400
But what we don't
want you to do is

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.450
go out and spend a lot of
money on attorneys and CPAs

00:13:29.450 --> 00:13:31.570
and form all these
entities if you're really

00:13:31.570 --> 00:13:34.530
not going to be able to buy
property maybe until next year.

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:35.030
Right?

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:37.040
Because California,
not only do we

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:40.310
have to pay the attorney
to form the entity.

00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:43.600
The state also charges
us at least $800

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.880
per year, per
entity, just in fees.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.480
So before you start
making any money,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.780
we just want to make
sure that the cost is

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.700
justified by the profit that
you're going to be making.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.116
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Well, and
think about it for Jeff too.

00:13:58.116 --> 00:14:00.080
He was $10,000 in that
he had already spent.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.540
And that, I think he had
even borrowed most of that,

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:03.687
if I remember.

00:14:03.687 --> 00:14:04.770
And he had no other money.

00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.800
That could've been
$10,000 as a down payment

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:09.150
on a potential
investment property.

00:14:09.150 --> 00:14:11.560
Obviously out of state,
probably, somewhere.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.390
So that's the thing
you got to look at,

00:14:13.390 --> 00:14:16.270
is weighing what do
you have to spend

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:21.110
and not doing-- what is
it-- paralysis by analysis

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:25.560
or analysis paralysis, where
we've seen that, where people,

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.760
they feel like I need
to know this much

00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:29.954
or whatever that
much is, they feel

00:14:29.954 --> 00:14:31.120
like they need to get there.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.050
When in reality,
take small steps.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:36.110
Pull the trigger.

00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:37.810
Learn your lessons.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.062
You can always create an
entity after the fact.

00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:41.520
If you need it for
asset protection

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.570
to title the property
into the entity.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:45.250
That's doable.

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.400
It doesn't need to
be done upfront.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.230
So there's ways to make it work
without spending a boatload.

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:53.850
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Right.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.340
So I hear people
talking about setting up

00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.500
LLCs for tax benefits.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.240
Are there additional tax
benefits you gain with an LLC?

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:06.570
AMANDA HAN: Well, it depends.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:08.960
It depends on what you're
doing in real estate.

00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:11.460
Because real estate's
a general term, right?

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:13.590
So you could be doing
rental real estate.

00:15:13.590 --> 00:15:15.300
You could be doing
property management.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:16.964
You could be doing
wholesale and fix and flip.

00:15:16.964 --> 00:15:18.206
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Let's say buy
and hold, because most of us

00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:19.220
do that.

00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.980
AMANDA HAN: Yeah,
for buy and hold,

00:15:20.980 --> 00:15:23.929
there is not an
added tax benefit.

00:15:23.929 --> 00:15:26.220
So what that means is if you
buy a rental property down

00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:28.540
the street, you will
get the same write off

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:31.110
and deductions as if
you own the property

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.435
in your individual name.

00:15:32.435 --> 00:15:35.500
So earlier we were talking
about maybe shifting income

00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.400
to your kids, pay them to
help with your receipts

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:39.870
and bookkeeping on the rentals.

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:41.650
You can do that
with an LLC, or you

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:44.490
can do that if you own the
property in your personal name.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:46.380
Same with travel expenses.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.210
If you're deducting
a home office,

00:15:48.210 --> 00:15:51.700
all those are the same
with or without an LLC.

00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.930
Now, if you're someone
who's more involved

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:58.650
in active real estate-- and
some common examples of that

00:15:58.650 --> 00:16:02.380
would be wholesaling, flipping,
you're doing syndications,

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.335
maybe you're a realtor,
also, on the side

00:16:04.335 --> 00:16:06.460
and you're making
commissions income.

00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.720
In those examples
there are tax benefits

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.580
of being inside
of a legal entity.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.040
Because that type of
income is taxed differently

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:15.220
than rental real estate.

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.740
But for rental real
estate purposes,

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:19.490
there's not really
an added benefit.

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:22.470
In fact, there's a cost that we
just talked about, right? $800,

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.090
at least, to the state
every single year.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.360
But we do have a lot
of clients who have

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.280
LLCs for rental real estate.

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:32.980
Mostly it's for asset
protection purposes.

00:16:32.980 --> 00:16:35.840
So if you're someone
who has a lot of equity

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:39.060
in the real estate, or if
you have a lot of net worth,

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.740
it could make sense to have an
LLC, just for asset protection

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.980
reasons.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.900
OK?

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.691
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Now,
Are there other ways

00:16:46.691 --> 00:16:48.840
to get asset protection
outside the LLCs,

00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:51.860
like umbrella insurance
or anything else?

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:54.510
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:56.150
There's other ways, for sure.

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:57.860
And we talk to our
clients about it.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.050
One is legal entities.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:00.895
That's one option.

00:17:00.895 --> 00:17:02.270
You mentioned
umbrella insurance.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.884
That's a good option as well.

00:17:04.884 --> 00:17:07.300
One of the tips we like to
mention with umbrella insurance

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.150
is just to make sure that the
activity that you are hoping

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.166
it's going to cover, that
actually the insurance

00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:14.040
covers that activity.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:17.550
Because we've talked to even
our own insurance agent,

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.260
like for one of our
rental properties.

00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:21.705
And we want to make sure the
investment covers investment

00:17:21.705 --> 00:17:22.205
properties.

00:17:22.205 --> 00:17:22.980
Yes, it does.

00:17:22.980 --> 00:17:24.800
OK, well, send us the policy.

00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.819
We flip to the Exclusions page.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:28.900
And lo and behold,
bullet point number five

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:30.810
says it excludes
investment properties.

00:17:30.810 --> 00:17:32.470
So he obviously didn't know
what he was talking about.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:34.767
So I mention that because
I've heard that from clients

00:17:34.767 --> 00:17:37.100
as well, is that sometimes
they look at their exclusions

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:39.150
and it specifically
mentions it's not included.

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:42.157
So if you're going to get
umbrella, make sure it covers.

00:17:42.157 --> 00:17:43.990
If it doesn't, make
sure it has a rider that

00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:47.165
covers investment properties.

00:17:47.165 --> 00:17:48.540
AMANDA HAN: Also
debt-- you know,

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:51.590
debt is a really good
asset protection tool.

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.710
So if you have a property
where it's mostly debt,

00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:59.160
odds of someone suing
and getting access

00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.570
to that small amount of equity
is probably not as traumatizing

00:18:03.570 --> 00:18:06.539
as if you had a property where
you might have paid all cash

00:18:06.539 --> 00:18:08.830
or you have a couple thousand
dollars worth of equities

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:09.710
sitting in there.

00:18:09.710 --> 00:18:11.232
That might keep you up at night.

00:18:11.232 --> 00:18:12.273
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:18:12.273 --> 00:18:15.806
I have a specific
question for a Googler.

00:18:15.806 --> 00:18:19.550
"When would an S Corp. Make
more sense than the LLC?"

00:18:19.550 --> 00:18:21.155
The person owns two
investment houses

00:18:21.155 --> 00:18:23.140
and would like to buy more.

00:18:23.140 --> 00:18:24.796
"The growing question
for my husband

00:18:24.796 --> 00:18:27.590
and I is, should we own these
individually, or have them

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.432
in some sort of
business corporation?

00:18:29.432 --> 00:18:30.870
What is the best
way to structure

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:33.418
owning multiple properties
to optimize taxes paid

00:18:33.418 --> 00:18:35.295
and protect ourself?"

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:37.170
AMANDA HAN: So that's
a really good question,

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.120
going back to what we
were just talking about.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.230
For rental real estate,
whether you own one

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:45.330
or whether you own 100, there's
really not a tax difference

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:48.586
whether you own it
personally or in your LLC.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:50.460
Now, for that particular
person, the question

00:18:50.460 --> 00:18:53.960
about as the S Corporation,
that's a really good question.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.710
So generally, we
recommend S Corporations

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.200
for active real estate
income, so wholesale,

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:03.160
fix and flip, real
estate commissions.

00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:08.320
One little tip that we
tell a lot of our clients

00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.860
is if you're someone who's
doing active real estate,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:15.380
it might make sense
to form an LLC.

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:18.400
That LLC, we can
always choose later

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.040
on how it wants to pay taxes.

00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.660
Meaning a year from now, we can
look back and say, well, how

00:19:23.660 --> 00:19:25.450
did your active real estate do?

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.300
What was the profit?

00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.270
Was it $10,000?

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:29.090
Was it $100,000?

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.800
And from there, we
can retroactively

00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.720
file changes with
the IRS to say, OK,

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:39.190
now I want this LLC to be
taxed as an S Corp or a C Corp,

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:44.350
or even just as a disregarded
entity, being an LLC itself.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.030
On the active income side, if
you're a real estate investor

00:19:47.030 --> 00:19:52.590
making active income, the S Corp
does save you roughly 7% to 15%

00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:56.550
in taxes, on average, as opposed
to earning that type of money

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.580
in your individual name.

00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.600
So that's where the
tax savings comes from.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:02.600
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Another
tip with the S Corp,

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.010
going back to the
investment property,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.950
we generally do not
recommend having

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.300
S Corporations own rental
properties, long-term hold

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.187
investment properties.

00:20:13.187 --> 00:20:14.770
The reason being is
that down the road

00:20:14.770 --> 00:20:17.130
it can create adverse
tax consequences.

00:20:17.130 --> 00:20:21.170
So let's say, the S
Corp owns a property.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:22.352
Maybe it's got debt on it.

00:20:22.352 --> 00:20:23.060
Maybe it doesn't.

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.590
But you're trying
to refinance it.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:27.302
Sometimes the banks are
going to want the property

00:20:27.302 --> 00:20:29.260
to be owned in your title
deed or personal name

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:30.093
for whatever reason.

00:20:30.093 --> 00:20:32.310
Because maybe you have to
get the loan, or something

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.810
like that.

00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:34.935
Well, if you have to transfer
title from the S Corp

00:20:34.935 --> 00:20:36.500
to the personal
in that situation,

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:38.340
that creates phantom
income for you,

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:39.780
as if you sold the property.

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:41.280
And so that's why
we generally don't

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.480
recommend using a
C Corp or even an S

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.110
Corp to own rental properties.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.270
That's where owning
in your personal name

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:49.453
or looking at LLCs
for asset protection

00:20:49.453 --> 00:20:51.720
would be probably the way to go.

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.170
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Makes sense.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:54.545
Another question
from a Googler--

00:20:54.545 --> 00:20:57.450
"If I purchase a buy-and-hold
property under my own name

00:20:57.450 --> 00:20:59.910
then later decide to
create an LLC, how tricky

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.900
is it to transfer the
existing property into the LLC

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:04.370
without paying gains?

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.300
I've heard that this
being done, but I've also

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:10.769
read that it can be a pain."

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:12.310
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
How tricky is it?

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:14.290
It's not "tricky."

00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:16.840
But it can be done without
any tax consequences.

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.930
So you can own a property
in your personal name,

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.100
decide six months
later to create an LLC

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:23.730
and want to hold title
for protection purposes.

00:21:23.730 --> 00:21:27.459
You can transfer
title using a deed.

00:21:27.459 --> 00:21:28.750
It should be as simple as that.

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:30.208
You have to look
at your insurance.

00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:33.000
Make sure that you're adding
the LLC as an additional insured

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.900
on your insurance policy.

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:37.720
If you have debt
on the property,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.550
technically that's going to
trigger to due-on-sale clause.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.292
So a lot of our
clients just leave

00:21:42.292 --> 00:21:44.000
the debt in their
personal name, transfer

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.440
title, keep paying the debt,
and that's not an issue.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:46.740
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Can you explain

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:47.830
what the due-on-sale clause is?

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:48.490
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Yeah, due-on-sale just

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:51.776
means on a mortgage-- there's a
clause in everybody's mortgage

00:21:51.776 --> 00:21:53.150
that says, if you
try to transfer

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:55.740
title of this property,
we, as the lender,

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.420
have the right to
call the note due,

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.450
meaning you have to pay us back.

00:21:59.450 --> 00:22:02.935
Now, I've never heard of a
bank actually doing that.

00:22:02.935 --> 00:22:05.060
But technically speaking,
if you transferred title,

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.130
they could do it.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:07.704
But again, most
banks, they'll do it,

00:22:07.704 --> 00:22:10.120
especially if you continue to
pay the mortgage, obviously.

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.720
So now, you can go
to them and ask them.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.905
Most banks will probably say no.

00:22:15.905 --> 00:22:17.780
Like I said, most clients
just transfer title

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.695
and leave the debt where it
is and just deal with it.

00:22:21.695 --> 00:22:23.570
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Going
back to tax strategy,

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:27.800
can you explain what
a 1031 exchange is?

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:32.460
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Yeah,
so a 1031 exchange, it's

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.196
simple as think about
it back to Monopoly.

00:22:35.196 --> 00:22:36.320
You've got the green house.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.861
You want to buy the
red hotel, or you

00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:40.200
want to sell the green house
and buy two green houses.

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.320
And you want to do it in
a tax-efficient manner.

00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:43.945
So maybe that first
green house, you've

00:22:43.945 --> 00:22:45.640
built up a lot of
equity and gain.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.280
If you sell it, you're going to
have a big gain and a big tax

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.040
bill.

00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:51.060
Well, the IRS has
this code-- 1031--

00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:54.050
that allows you to sell that
if you reinvest it and follow

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:56.984
the rules into new
investment properties,

00:22:56.984 --> 00:22:58.400
you don't have to
pay the tax when

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.287
you sell the first property.

00:23:00.287 --> 00:23:01.870
It basically defers
that tax until you

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.750
sell the new properties
down the road.

00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:06.550
Like, theoretically,
you could continue.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.365
You could sell one,
buy a replacement,

00:23:08.365 --> 00:23:10.220
sell that one two
years later, and just

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:11.630
rolling this down the road.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.160
And theoretically, not paying
taxes for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.430
So it's a great
vehicle for investors

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:22.750
to keep that extra
chunk of cash that you

00:23:22.750 --> 00:23:25.000
might lose to taxes if you
were to sell your property.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.310
Because think about it.

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:28.430
If your tax bill was
going to be $50,000,

00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:31.000
I mean, that $50,000 is a down
payment on another investment

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.970
property.

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:34.830
So if you can save that now,
buy another property that's

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:38.080
going to appreciate,
generate cash flow for you,

00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.730
you're taking away
that tax drag that's

00:23:40.730 --> 00:23:42.962
going to slow you down
from building wealth.

00:23:42.962 --> 00:23:45.420
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, this is a
really interesting time for you

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:46.045
to bring it up.

00:23:46.045 --> 00:23:49.170
I just talked to a
new client yesterday.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:52.240
The woman is 96 years old.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.830
And she came in with her son.

00:23:54.830 --> 00:23:57.720
They bought a property
in LA, back in the days,

00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.530
for something like $20,000.

00:24:00.530 --> 00:24:03.090
Now it's worth
over $2.2 million.

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:07.160
And so for them to sell it
outright, pay the capital

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.852
gain between Federal
and California,

00:24:08.852 --> 00:24:10.310
in case you didn't
know, California

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:11.710
doesn't have capital gains.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:13.885
So we're just paying
ordinary income tax

00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:15.970
on the sale of real estate.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:20.250
So close to a million dollars
would go away into taxes

00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:23.620
if they were to sell this
property just without a 1031.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.510
So one of the things
that we're working on

00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:30.190
is for them to sell and to
buy a couple of replacement

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.990
properties, both in state.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.970
And they're also looking
for out of state.

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:37.480
So essentially, that
allows them to lock

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:40.840
in the gain on this
highly-appreciated property

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.400
with zero taxes.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.710
And because mom
is so old in age,

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.160
the ultimate strategy
would be for mom

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.942
to basically pass away with
these properties in her trust.

00:24:55.942 --> 00:24:58.400
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: You laugh,
but this is a real strategy.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.066
I'm telling you.

00:24:59.066 --> 00:25:00.190
[LAUGHS]

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:01.776
AMANDA HAN: Sorry, I don't
mean the ultimate strategy is

00:25:01.776 --> 00:25:02.984
for her to pass away, period.

00:25:02.984 --> 00:25:04.280
[LAUGHS]

00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:07.310
After she passes
away, then the kids

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:10.690
inherit the real estate
from mom through the trust.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:13.110
And what happens
is, at that time,

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:16.030
the kids can turn around
and sell those properties

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.770
the very next day if they
wanted to, for $2 million.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:23.690
And they would get that
money completely tax free.

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.750
So 1031's a very, very
powerful strategy.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.900
A lot of times for many people,
for many long-term investors,

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.580
it's kind of a let's
make sure we keep it

00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:34.080
in the parents'
name, and then we

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.290
pass it to the kids
with zero taxes ever.

00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:40.570
So the question is
she had $2 million,

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:42.740
what if the properties
were worth a lot more--

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.530
$5, $10 million?

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:44.850
That's a really great question.

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:48.190
Right now, the estate tax,
the first roughly $5 million

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:49.170
is tax free.

00:25:49.170 --> 00:25:52.420
So for a husband and wife,
this strategy is s up to,

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.975
roughly, the first $10 million.

00:25:53.975 --> 00:25:56.580
You don't have to worry
about estate taxes.

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.390
For those of you with parents
that have over $10 million

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:02.780
worth of estate
taxes, it's going

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:04.270
to be a combination strategy.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.890
Part of that should probably
be gifted to the kids

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:11.170
now, so that we leave roughly
$10 million in parents' name.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:13.600
It's really exciting
to do that kind

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.405
of multigenerational planning.

00:26:15.405 --> 00:26:17.780
JORDAN THIBODEAU: So let's
say I had a personal residence

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:21.040
and I wanted to do
a 1031 exchange.

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.670
Could I sell that property
and push those funds

00:26:23.670 --> 00:26:25.570
into an apartment complex?

00:26:25.570 --> 00:26:29.040
Or does it have to be
a like kind property?

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.180
AMANDA HAN: So
really good question.

00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:34.820
If you own a primary
home and it's

00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:39.370
highly appreciated in this
area, after the gain exclusion,

00:26:39.370 --> 00:26:43.690
you can only use a 1031
exchange if you turn that home

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.560
into a rental first.

00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:47.050
So if I just have
a primary home,

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:49.980
it's always been a primary
home, I cannot 1031 exchange

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.600
into some other property.

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:53.325
I would have to pay
taxes on the gain.

00:26:53.325 --> 00:26:54.950
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
What's the difference

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:59.512
between retroactive tax strategy
and proactive tax strategy?

00:26:59.512 --> 00:27:01.220
You brought that up
in the book, and that

00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:02.954
was a really interesting topic.

00:27:02.954 --> 00:27:04.370
AMANDA HAN: Well,
there's actually

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:07.260
no such thing as a
retroactive tax "strategy,"

00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:10.520
because you can't
plan after the fact.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:16.630
So really if you're meeting with
your CPA January through April,

00:27:16.630 --> 00:27:18.650
there's really
not any strategies

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:19.990
going on at that time.

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:22.420
Really we're just looking
at OK, what did you do?

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.680
And what's the best
way we can present

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.330
what has already happened?

00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:28.740
So in a 1031 exchange
scenario, for example,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.860
if you sold the property and
then we see you next year,

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.340
well, we can't really do a 1031
because the year's gone by.

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:38.325
And in fact, the sale
transaction has been closed.

00:27:38.325 --> 00:27:40.780
Proactive strategy
really is just

00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:44.160
meeting with your tax
advisors throughout the year

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.510
before you make these
significant financial or

00:27:48.510 --> 00:27:51.690
personal decisions-- a
decision to leave your job,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.480
to start a new job, to move
your retirement money around,

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.500
buy, sell real
estate, obviously.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.210
And so before you enter
into a transaction,

00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.000
your advisor can
help you calculate

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.610
what is the tax impact?

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.416
And what are the options?

00:28:05.416 --> 00:28:06.790
Proactive planning
really is just

00:28:06.790 --> 00:28:09.270
another way to say, OK,
well here are your options.

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:11.810
You can either replace it and
save this amount of taxes.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:14.570
Or you can sell the
property, take the cash,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.190
and run with it
if you wanted to.

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:19.270
As long as you're willing to pay
the tax, maybe down the road.

00:28:19.270 --> 00:28:23.535
And tax planning doesn't have
to be very in-depth or scary.

00:28:23.535 --> 00:28:26.160
It doesn't have to be hours
and hours of sitting with a CPA

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.112
going over numbers.

00:28:27.112 --> 00:28:28.820
We really encourage
our clients like hey,

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:31.950
if you're doing anything at
all, send us a quick e-mail.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:34.230
You're moving, you're
thinking of changing jobs,

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.480
send us an e-mail.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.390
And then from that, we can look
at your situation and say, OK,

00:28:38.390 --> 00:28:40.240
does this warrant
a conversation?

00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.580
Do we have follow up questions?

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:43.680
Are there things that
maybe we're concerned with?

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.270
Or maybe there's nothing
we're concerned with.

00:28:45.270 --> 00:28:46.830
We say, OK, thanks
for the update.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:48.400
I'll keep it in
the back of my mind

00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.740
if something tax-law
wise comes up

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:52.970
that I think will
impact you, that's

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:55.160
when communication will be made.

00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.050
But it doesn't have to
be a very formal process

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:00.240
where it's very time intensive.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.610
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Gotcha.

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:05.236
In the book, you have a section
about self-directed 401K.

00:29:05.236 --> 00:29:06.450
It's a two-parter.

00:29:06.450 --> 00:29:08.840
First, what is a
self-directed 401K?

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.820
And as far as employees
who are working,

00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:16.360
who have benefits where they
get 401K contributions that

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:22.023
match, how can we take advantage
of a self-directed 401K?

00:29:22.023 --> 00:29:23.967
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
So kind of break up

00:29:23.967 --> 00:29:25.050
the question a little bit.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.130
So self-directed
retirement investing,

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:30.265
or self-directed
retirement plans,

00:29:30.265 --> 00:29:31.890
the term, self-directed,
all that means

00:29:31.890 --> 00:29:36.290
is that traditionally when you
go to open an IRA or a Roth IRA

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:39.534
at a custodian, Fidelity, pick
one, a Vanguard, whatever,

00:29:39.534 --> 00:29:41.450
they're going to give
you some options of what

00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:42.560
you can invest in, right?

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.322
Stocks, bonds, mutual funds.

00:29:44.322 --> 00:29:45.780
Well, the term
self-directed really

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:49.450
means you're going to a specific
type of retirement custodian

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.660
that you choose what
you want to invest in.

00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:56.410
So you can get your IRA
to invest in real estate.

00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:59.150
you can get it to
invest in collectibles.

00:29:59.150 --> 00:30:01.340
You can get it to invest
in almost anything.

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.840
A lot of people
don't know that they

00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.820
can use their IRA to
invest in things outside

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:06.550
of the stock market.

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.690
But it has been allowed
for 40 years or something.

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:13.240
So we have a lot of clients
that do self-directed investing.

00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:16.270
Now, they may be using
an individual retirement

00:30:16.270 --> 00:30:19.049
account, a self-directed
IRA or a self-directed Roth.

00:30:19.049 --> 00:30:20.590
Or they might have
their own business

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:23.791
where they've set up
a self-directed 401K.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:30.540
Any One of those options, the
type of investing you can do

00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.830
is basically all the same.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.440
And so if somebody
is working at Google,

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.730
you have a retirement
account here.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:40.450
But maybe you want
to start your own.

00:30:40.450 --> 00:30:42.757
You have an IRA on the
side, but maybe you're

00:30:42.757 --> 00:30:44.340
not happy with what
it's investing in,

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.022
and you know real estate.

00:30:46.022 --> 00:30:49.490
Well, maybe you can just roll
that money from your existing

00:30:49.490 --> 00:30:54.275
IRA, open up a self-directed
IRA to one of these custodians.

00:30:54.275 --> 00:30:55.150
Roll your money over.

00:30:55.150 --> 00:30:56.820
It's a tax-free rollover.

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.400
And then find your
investment vehicle

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.150
for that self-directed IRA,
and start investing in stuff

00:31:02.150 --> 00:31:06.430
that you know more about, or
that you have, knowledge wise,

00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.404
an advantage over them
in the stock market

00:31:08.404 --> 00:31:10.320
or in the mutual funds
or something like that.

00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.150
AMANDA HAN: I'm
curious-- have you

00:31:12.150 --> 00:31:15.210
looked into the possibility
of rolling your Google 401K

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:16.696
money into a self-directed?

00:31:16.696 --> 00:31:17.900
Have you asked that ever?

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.580
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I haven't
personally looked into that.

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.920
But it's a question
that's raised here.

00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:23.169
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, that might
be something for you guys

00:31:23.169 --> 00:31:25.040
collectively to talk
to Google about.

00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.810
Because the IRS does
not really care who

00:31:27.810 --> 00:31:30.890
your custodian is--
if it's with Google,

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:35.490
if it's with TD Ameritrade
or Morgan Stanley.

00:31:35.490 --> 00:31:37.770
So the IRS is the
same as if it was

00:31:37.770 --> 00:31:39.810
with a self-directed custodian.

00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.390
So it's kind of like
Wells Fargo versus B of A.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:45.020
It's all the same thing to them.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:48.500
So as long as your employer
allows you to do that,

00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:51.200
then it is possible to
roll your money-- the work

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.775
401K-- into a self-directed
IRA and be able to deploy

00:31:54.775 --> 00:31:55.650
that for real estate.

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.920
JORDAN THIBODEAU: What's
the best income tax

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.790
strategy for high-earned
income employees here?

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:07.950
And to follow through,
would be a good idea

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:11.370
to buy an investment property
if it was losing money, just

00:32:11.370 --> 00:32:14.261
for the tax benefits?

00:32:14.261 --> 00:32:14.760
OK.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:15.226
That's why the softball
was being thrown at you.

00:32:15.226 --> 00:32:15.948
[LAUGHS]

00:32:15.948 --> 00:32:17.864
I could see from the
reactions from your eyes,

00:32:17.864 --> 00:32:19.000
it was like, no.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.773
God, no.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:27.110
AMANDA HAN: I think for
high-income individuals,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:31.920
it is a good idea to invest in
profit-generating rental real

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920
estate.

00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:34.640
Because on other
types of investment

00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:37.160
you are making-- let's
say, in the stock market,

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.140
or invest in another
startup company-- the income

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.550
that you get is probably
going to be taxed,

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:43.970
along with your W-2 income.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:45.870
So that's going to be
at a high tax rate.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:48.050
Versus rental real
estate, at a minimum,

00:32:48.050 --> 00:32:50.570
it does give you a lot of tax
write offs-- a lot of the ones

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.520
we talked about
earlier-- in addition

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:55.640
to what Matt mentioned
about depreciation.

00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:59.400
So it's not uncommon for us
to see high-income individuals

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:03.090
invest in real estate
with the result being

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:05.910
that at least the
rental income is coming

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.760
to them on a tax-free basis.

00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.160
So that's the first
tier we want to get to,

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.802
is at least tax-free
rental income.

00:33:12.802 --> 00:33:14.260
And that is available,
I would say,

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:16.389
to the majority of
real estate investors.

00:33:16.389 --> 00:33:17.930
If you're working
with the right CPA,

00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:20.550
there should be enough
deductions pulled out

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:22.274
so you can reach that level.

00:33:22.274 --> 00:33:23.940
Then the next question
just becomes, OK,

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:27.420
if I do such a good job at
capturing my expenses that I

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:29.840
actually show a loss
on my tax return,

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.210
how can I use that to offset
the taxable income from my W-2,

00:33:34.210 --> 00:33:35.560
for example?

00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:37.860
And so one of the
great ways to do

00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:41.110
that is if you-- or if you're
married, you have a spouse--

00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:43.580
can qualify as a real
estate professional.

00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.940
By being a real
estate professional,

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:48.510
all that means in a
tax world is that you

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:52.360
can use the rental losses to
now offset the taxable income

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.069
from your W-2 as well.

00:33:54.069 --> 00:33:55.610
So instead of seeing
them separately,

00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:57.447
it's now all rolled into one.

00:33:57.447 --> 00:33:59.280
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: So
a big picture-- maybe

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.738
you've got enough
rental properties

00:34:00.738 --> 00:34:03.074
that, like we talked about,
are cash flow positive.

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:05.490
But we can generate enough
depreciation in the home office

00:34:05.490 --> 00:34:09.416
deductions, hiring your kids,
other strategies to generate

00:34:09.416 --> 00:34:11.219
that the expenses are
more than the income

00:34:11.219 --> 00:34:12.627
so you have a loss now.

00:34:12.627 --> 00:34:14.460
But really, you're still
cash-flow positive.

00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:17.110
But now we're just utilizing
deductions for all the things

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:18.632
that you already are paying for.

00:34:18.632 --> 00:34:21.090
And then you can use that to
offset the income taxes you're

00:34:21.090 --> 00:34:21.960
paying on your W-2.

00:34:21.960 --> 00:34:23.370
That's the ultimate goal.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.039
And that's where if
you can get someone

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:27.580
in the family that can qualify
as a real estate professional,

00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.540
that would allow you to do that.

00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:31.889
Or go marry somebody that's
a real estate professional.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.949
You know, marriage
counseling here, you know?

00:34:35.949 --> 00:34:37.409
So that's one way.

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:40.270
I mean he talked about other
things for high-income earners.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.480
One of the things we talk
to a lot of clients about,

00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:44.396
because it's something
we're passionate about.

00:34:44.396 --> 00:34:46.969
I know you said, you give
back a lot of your time.

00:34:46.969 --> 00:34:48.739
You can incorporate
charitable giving

00:34:48.739 --> 00:34:50.360
with real estate investing.

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:52.440
There's lots of different
strategies out there.

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.199
I mean, obviously you can give
straight cash to a charity.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.550
You can give household
goods to charity.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.390
You can do all that.

00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:59.931
But there's more
advanced strategies,

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.960
where you can put
money in things

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.220
that are a charitable trust.

00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.110
You can put money in.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.620
You can get a donation deduction
for the money going in.

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:10.540
And then the trust actually goes
out and buys rental properties

00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.030
and generates cash flow, and
then donates the cash flow

00:35:13.030 --> 00:35:13.930
to charities.

00:35:13.930 --> 00:35:17.180
And so it's a way for you
to still buy real estate,

00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:18.430
build wealth.

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:20.870
But at the same time,
get tax deductions now,

00:35:20.870 --> 00:35:23.250
if maybe you can't qualify as
a real estate professional,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.960
let's say, you're still
offsetting the high W-2 income.

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:28.706
So there's definitely
ways to do it.

00:35:28.706 --> 00:35:30.330
And sometimes it just
involves changing

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:31.580
the fact pattern a little bit.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.872
People have to be willing to
change their fact pattern.

00:35:33.872 --> 00:35:36.413
AMANDA HAN: I was going to say,
about the charitable planning

00:35:36.413 --> 00:35:38.930
strategy, I mean, it's a
somewhat advanced strategy.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.480
But one of the things that a
lot of people like about that

00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.190
is at the end of the day,
you do own the asset again.

00:35:46.190 --> 00:35:49.110
So you know, if what you donated
into the charitable trust

00:35:49.110 --> 00:35:51.980
is three rental
properties, for example,

00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:55.130
at the end of the trust term,
those three properties revert

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:57.440
back to your
ownership or your LLC,

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.800
or your estate,
however you dictate it.

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:01.214
And so that makes sense.

00:36:01.214 --> 00:36:02.630
A lot of times,
if we have clients

00:36:02.630 --> 00:36:06.820
who have an extraordinary year--
maybe stock options or payouts,

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.922
or something like that-- and
they want to buy real estate.

00:36:09.922 --> 00:36:12.380
They don't necessarily need
the income from the real estate

00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:13.025
just yet.

00:36:13.025 --> 00:36:14.150
But they do want the asset.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:16.233
They do want to own the
real estate in the future.

00:36:16.233 --> 00:36:19.130
It's a really great way to get
a very large write off in a year

00:36:19.130 --> 00:36:23.504
where you have a significant
increase of income.

00:36:23.504 --> 00:36:25.170
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I had two questions.

00:36:25.170 --> 00:36:27.120
One just under your
very first thing.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.054
I have two rental properties,
and also an umbrella policy.

00:36:31.054 --> 00:36:35.800
And what would we need
the umbrella policy for,

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.121
in terms of the rental property?

00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:40.620
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
So the question,

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.328
what do you need the
umbrella policy for,

00:36:42.328 --> 00:36:43.550
for the rental properties?

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:47.574
It's more for the exposure.

00:36:47.574 --> 00:36:48.990
And obviously we're
not attorneys.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.281
We're not litigation attorneys.

00:36:50.281 --> 00:36:53.280
But it's more of a if the
crap hits the fan, you know,

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.945
somebody trips and falls
on your property or--

00:36:55.945 --> 00:36:57.320
AUDIENCE: On the
rental property?

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:59.445
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Yeah,
on your rental property--

00:36:59.445 --> 00:37:01.850
falls off a railing or decides
to see you for some reason

00:37:01.850 --> 00:37:06.740
and can make the argument,
in a court of law,

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.600
they should be
entitled to something.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.900
That's where the umbrella
insurance, theoretically,

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.060
would kick in to
protect you, for having

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.720
to fork out $50,000 for
some plaintiff or something.

00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.160
AUDIENCE: Sorry, actually, but
my most important question.

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.820
My kind of funny personal thing.

00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:25.820
But my sister is breaking up
with her boyfriend in Atlanta.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:27.490
And they own a condominium.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.580
She owns 1/3.

00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:29.289
He owns 2/3.

00:37:29.289 --> 00:37:31.330
She doesn't have a lot of
money, a lot of income.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:36.510
So I'm going to buy him out, his
2/3 property, his 2/3 portion.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:39.310
How should I structure that,
in terms of my income tax?

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:41.460
Or how would a
person, anybody here,

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.390
buying a property
with a sibling,

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:45.890
how can you do that
so that you can maybe

00:37:45.890 --> 00:37:48.400
treat that as
rental income and I

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.880
could get some
kind of deduction,

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.264
but she can continue
having partial ownership?

00:37:53.264 --> 00:37:53.930
AMANDA HAN: Hmm.

00:37:53.930 --> 00:37:54.890
That's a really good question.

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.470
So I'm assuming your sister
is going to still live there

00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:58.790
as her primary home.

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:01.310
So generally, the way we set
up on the tax returns side,

00:38:01.310 --> 00:38:05.140
is you would claim the
1/2 of it, or 2/3 of that,

00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:08.350
as rental income,
rental expenses.

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:09.950
And then her
portion of that, she

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:11.820
would just claim as a
regular primary home.

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.945
So she would have a little
bit of mortgage interest

00:38:13.945 --> 00:38:15.570
and property taxes.

00:38:15.570 --> 00:38:21.240
Now, with respect to how
you hold title, again,

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:23.130
if it's a rental
property, we're not

00:38:23.130 --> 00:38:25.370
very too concerned with taxes.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.380
There is no tax benefit
or detriment either way.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.850
Keep in mind, even though
it's an out-of-state property,

00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.650
and if you formed an
out-of-state LLC, just

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:34.960
by the fact that you're
a California resident

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.000
means that you will have to pay
$800 for that out-of-state LLC

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:39.540
here.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:42.760
So really, the question
is how comfortable are you

00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:45.500
with going into partnership with
your sister, the odds of you

00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.430
guys suing each other?

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.550
If you guys are close, the odds
of your sister as your tenant,

00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:53.650
suing you, is probably very low.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:55.880
Yeah, the question is
if you're not really

00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.480
charging a lot of rent, how
does that work as a rental?

00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.680
So on the tax side, you do
have to charge her rent.

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:03.180
Otherwise you
don't have a stance

00:39:03.180 --> 00:39:05.000
to take as a rental property.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.300
It could be below market
value, because it's

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:08.580
a partial ownership.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.660
That's perfectly fine.

00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:11.880
So maybe she pays
you $300 of rent.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:14.502
But you'll still
get your 1/2 or 2/3

00:39:14.502 --> 00:39:16.210
of mortgage interest
and stuff like that.

00:39:16.210 --> 00:39:18.220
AUDIENCE: But isn't
that more of a given?

00:39:18.220 --> 00:39:19.470
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: It can be.

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:22.180
Gift taxes can definitely
come into situations

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:25.000
where family member's involved
and you have transactions

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:25.707
or below market.

00:39:25.707 --> 00:39:27.540
So there's definitely
things to think about.

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.147
The other thing I
was thinking was

00:39:29.147 --> 00:39:30.980
in terms of how you
structure the ownership.

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:33.360
You might want to look at
economically, outside of taxes,

00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.930
economically look at do you
get a better deal buying it all

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:40.461
yourself, from a mortgage
standpoint or a financing

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:40.960
perspective?

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.001
Or maybe it flip flopped.

00:39:42.001 --> 00:39:42.992
Maybe your sister does.

00:39:42.992 --> 00:39:44.700
So those are other
things, outside taxes,

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.980
things to think about
too, just how you actually

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.970
buy the property.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.370
AUDIENCE: I was curious if you
do much with family limited

00:39:53.370 --> 00:39:54.095
partnerships?

00:39:54.095 --> 00:39:55.720
This is something I
read about recently

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.850
that was pretty fascinating
for protecting your assets,

00:39:59.850 --> 00:40:04.462
as well as shielding
your taxable inheritance.

00:40:04.462 --> 00:40:06.670
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Yeah,
family limited partnerships

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.620
are very, very popular.

00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:11.910
They've been around, tried
and true in the tax world,

00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:16.320
in the tax court for decades.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:19.710
They are very common
with families that

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:21.380
have a large amount of assets.

00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.640
So we were talking about
the $10 million earlier.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.710
Family limited
partnerships can be

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:28.820
very helpful in those
situations, where you're

00:40:28.820 --> 00:40:31.960
trying to-- as Amanda
was mentioning-- kind

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.990
of gifting partial ownership
of properties over time,

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.180
to your kids.

00:40:36.180 --> 00:40:42.270
So that can be a way to start
taking a portion of the asset

00:40:42.270 --> 00:40:45.445
out of the parent's estate,
so that they're decreasing

00:40:45.445 --> 00:40:47.570
their value of their estate
to maybe try and get it

00:40:47.570 --> 00:40:49.012
under the $10 million.

00:40:49.012 --> 00:40:52.171
But at the same time, they're
still controlling the asset.

00:40:52.171 --> 00:40:53.920
But the kids are
involved in the business.

00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:55.690
Because in the
limited partnership,

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.540
generally it's four,
five, six family members

00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.594
are all the partners.

00:40:59.594 --> 00:41:03.160
And so that's where
it's used a lot.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:06.760
There's ways to use it to
shift income to different kids

00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:07.290
as well.

00:41:07.290 --> 00:41:09.492
So there's a lot
of benefits for it.

00:41:09.492 --> 00:41:10.950
But from a big-picture
perspective,

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:13.580
we see it used a lot
with the families that

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.689
have $5, $10, $15
million-plus in assets.

00:41:16.689 --> 00:41:17.980
AUDIENCE: The asset protection?

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:20.240
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: Yeah,
the question was, in terms

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.430
of asset protection, can it be
a better vehicle for investing

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.150
within the family than an LLC?

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:30.366
I think that's probably more
of a question for an attorney.

00:41:30.366 --> 00:41:33.550
And I think it
probably could be.

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:36.390
But theoretically, both
come with "limited liability

00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.890
protection."

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.940
So I'd really have to
defer that to an attorney.

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:44.360
AMANDA HAN: I think practically
speaking, the vast majority

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.940
of our clients who own rental
real estate use LLCs rather

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.990
than family limited
partnerships, are

00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:53.680
older clients who've
been in real estate

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.540
for many, many years tend to
use family limited partnerships.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:59.110
And I think partly because the
nature of the estate planning

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:00.010
component.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.300
And then partly just
because back in the days,

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.060
FLPs were much more prevalent.

00:42:05.060 --> 00:42:09.240
And now LLCs are typically
more preferred by attorneys

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.597
for asset protection.

00:42:10.597 --> 00:42:12.930
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: And another
thing worth pointing out

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:15.072
is with the limited
partnership, technically,

00:42:15.072 --> 00:42:17.030
with every one of them,
you have to have what's

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:18.365
called a general partner.

00:42:18.365 --> 00:42:19.820
The general partner
is the person

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:24.050
or the entity that's going
to have unlimited liability

00:42:24.050 --> 00:42:24.559
exposure.

00:42:24.559 --> 00:42:26.600
So a lot of times, with
the limited partnerships,

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:30.380
you have to create a corporation
to be the general partner,

00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:32.596
to hold 1%, 5%, 10%.

00:42:32.596 --> 00:42:33.720
Obviously that can be done.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:36.190
It's not earth shattering.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.940
But it's one other
thing you've got to do.

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:39.856
It's another corporation
you've got to create.

00:42:39.856 --> 00:42:43.009
With an LLC, you don't have to
have a general partner, per se.

00:42:43.009 --> 00:42:44.300
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:46.060
It's a newbie question.

00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.650
Suppose I have a
primary residence.

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:55.520
I stay there for a couple of
years and build some equity.

00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.240
And then what's
the best strategy?

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.630
Compare, say, I sell the house
and get half a million capital

00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:05.430
gain free, or I cash
out some of the money

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:07.900
and then you do
house improvements

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:12.855
and get the benefits of
the mortgage tax deduction?

00:43:12.855 --> 00:43:17.320
Or compare with use the cash or
the money on rental property,

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:21.330
and I heard I can also get
the deduction on the mortgage

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:22.280
interest.

00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:24.260
So compare these
three strategies.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.290
Which one is the most tax
efficient in the longer run?

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:32.070
AMANDA HAN: Well, I think if
your primary home is highly

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.590
appreciated, from a
tax perspective, first

00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:39.750
and foremost, is to lock in that
$250,000 or $500,000 tax free.

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.160
And so you can do that.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.676
Let's say, you sold
your house today.

00:43:43.676 --> 00:43:45.050
You've been in
there for a couple

00:43:45.050 --> 00:43:47.252
years, two to three years.

00:43:47.252 --> 00:43:47.960
Then that's fine.

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.720
You can move out, sell
it, get the tax-free gain,

00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:53.000
take the cash, and then do
whatever you want with it.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.620
Buy other rental properties,
buy a new primary home.

00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:56.850
That's all perfectly fine.

00:43:56.850 --> 00:44:00.300
If you feel like that home has
more appreciation potential--

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.550
you want to keep it, but you
want to turn it into a rental,

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:05.610
you can do that as well.

00:44:05.610 --> 00:44:09.190
We do recommend, though, that
if you move out of your home,

00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:13.059
you sell it within three years
of turning it into a rental.

00:44:13.059 --> 00:44:15.100
Because you have that
additional three-year grace

00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:17.530
period, where you have
that rental income.

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.640
And when you go
sell, you still can

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.381
tap into that $250,000 or
$500,000 of capital gains.

00:44:22.381 --> 00:44:24.380
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: So
even though you moved out

00:44:24.380 --> 00:44:28.020
three years ago, you still get
to use that primary residence

00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:29.520
tax-free exclusion,
even though it's

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.740
been a rental property
for the last three years.

00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:33.426
So you can even do that.

00:44:33.426 --> 00:44:35.175
And then you can tack
on the 1031 exchange

00:44:35.175 --> 00:44:36.590
that we talked about earlier.

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:40.100
So you can actually take
your $500,000 tax-free cash

00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:42.270
in your pocket,
do a 1031 exchange

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.650
on the rest of the property,
buy a replacement investment

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:46.760
property, and then
continue to roll that,

00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:49.130
but still get your tax-free
money in your pocket.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:52.040
So we've had clients use that
multiple times and it works out

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:52.540
really well.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:52.820
AUDIENCE: Can you do both?

00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.850
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Yeah, you can do both.

00:44:53.850 --> 00:44:54.473
It's awesome.

00:44:54.473 --> 00:44:55.420
AMANDA HAN: Yeah.

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.878
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
So the question

00:44:56.878 --> 00:45:00.610
is if I keep the property,
refinance it, use the money

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:02.560
to do home
improvements, to improve

00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.545
that property, or refinancing,
use that money to go out

00:45:05.545 --> 00:45:07.040
and buy an investment property.

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.820
And I think from an
accountant's perspective,

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:11.920
it's going to come
down to numbers.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:14.044
It's like, if you're going
to improve the property,

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:16.550
what's it going to
be worth after it

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:18.010
appreciates and improves?

00:45:18.010 --> 00:45:20.050
What do you plan to do with it?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:22.567
If you do take the money
out and reinvest it,

00:45:22.567 --> 00:45:23.900
where are you going to reinvest?

00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:27.466
What kind of returns
are you going to get?

00:45:27.466 --> 00:45:29.340
We like tapping into
equity and utilizing it.

00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.580
Because we don't
necessarily want equity

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:33.845
not doing anything for you.

00:45:33.845 --> 00:45:36.220
But you got to be smart about
it and make good decisions,

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.354
obviously.

00:45:37.354 --> 00:45:39.270
AUDIENCE: So in terms
of transferring property

00:45:39.270 --> 00:45:42.040
from parents to children,
is leaving it in a trust

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:44.634
until they die by far
the best strategy?

00:45:44.634 --> 00:45:46.300
Or are there advantages
to it otherwise?

00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:49.460
AMANDA HAN: It depends on
the net worth of the parents.

00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:52.960
So if the parents combined net
worth is under $10 million,

00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:55.964
then generally speaking,
that would be the case.

00:45:55.964 --> 00:45:58.380
Of course there's always going
to be different things that

00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.280
are non-tax-related
that come into play--

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.130
the health of the parents,
will they need long-term care?

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:04.669
Do they have creditors?

00:46:04.669 --> 00:46:06.460
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
The age of the parents.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:08.126
AMANDA HAN: But
generally speaking, yes,

00:46:08.126 --> 00:46:11.350
under $10 million, it's better
to leave assets in the parent's

00:46:11.350 --> 00:46:12.660
name and have the kids inherit.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:14.160
And that's not just
for real estate.

00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:16.930
That's also with
stocks, anything

00:46:16.930 --> 00:46:18.420
that appreciates in value.

00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.610
And the reason for that
is when we pass away,

00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:23.110
every person get what's
called a step-up basis.

00:46:23.110 --> 00:46:25.720
So regardless of what you bought
the property or your stocks

00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:29.160
for, when you die,
the kids-- or whoever

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:31.045
your beneficiaries
are-- will get it

00:46:31.045 --> 00:46:33.160
at whatever that day's value is.

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:35.220
AUDIENCE: And there's no
limit to that step up?

00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.494
AMANDA HAN: There's no
limit to the step up, yeah.

00:46:37.494 --> 00:46:39.350
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: So I
had a client the other day

00:46:39.350 --> 00:46:40.933
who basically asked
the same question.

00:46:40.933 --> 00:46:44.500
Their parent was, I
want to say, 75, 76.

00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:48.030
And my response was no, I don't
think it makes a lot of sense.

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:51.034
Because your parents are closer
to death than they're not.

00:46:51.034 --> 00:46:52.326
He's like, what does that mean?

00:46:52.326 --> 00:46:54.033
He's like, my parents
are in good health.

00:46:54.033 --> 00:46:55.247
And I say, well, they're 75.

00:46:55.247 --> 00:46:56.330
That means they're not 30.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:46:57.020
They're not 40.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.430
They're closer to passing away
than they were 30 years ago.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:04.100
And so their window for passing
away, maybe it's 5 years,

00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:05.020
maybe it's 20 years.

00:47:05.020 --> 00:47:07.320
But they're still closer
to that than they were.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:09.590
And so if there's a
lot of gain in there,

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.440
it's hard to advise somebody to
give up on that tax-free gain

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:17.224
that you could get 5, 10,
15 years down the road.

00:47:17.224 --> 00:47:18.890
AUDIENCE: If we have
a primary residence

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:22.640
and also some buy and
hold rental property,

00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:26.990
can you talk about if the AMT
affects what we can deduct?

00:47:29.684 --> 00:47:31.850
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: So if
I understand the question,

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:33.170
so you've got a
primary residence,

00:47:33.170 --> 00:47:34.930
you got a rental
property, and kind of how

00:47:34.930 --> 00:47:36.665
that plays in affecting AMT?

00:47:36.665 --> 00:47:37.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:40.800
Well, if our job
makes us fall into AMT

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:43.340
does it change any
tax strategies?

00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:46.330
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: So
AMT is just an acronym.

00:47:46.330 --> 00:47:48.405
It just means
Alternative Minimum Tax.

00:47:48.405 --> 00:47:50.080
If you're at a
30,000-foot level,

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.680
it's an extra tax that the IRS
put in place about 30 years

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.880
ago.

00:47:55.880 --> 00:48:00.310
It was actually put in place
so that the wealthy people

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:03.680
of the time could stop using all
these tax loopholes they were

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:05.480
using to avoid paying taxes.

00:48:05.480 --> 00:48:08.620
And so they were trying to put
in place a minimum level of tax

00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.050
that they wanted people to pay.

00:48:10.050 --> 00:48:15.454
And so unfortunately for
people who live in California,

00:48:15.454 --> 00:48:17.120
it's kind of like a
parallel tax system.

00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.078
One of the things that's
not deductible for AMT

00:48:19.078 --> 00:48:20.600
is state income taxes.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.950
And California and New
York are the two states

00:48:22.950 --> 00:48:24.658
that have the highest
state income taxes.

00:48:24.658 --> 00:48:26.760
Your highest rate
here is like, 13%.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:31.970
So generally speaking, if
a taxpayer in California

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:36.830
is making $150,000
to $300,000 a year

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.590
and paying a good
chunk in state taxes,

00:48:40.590 --> 00:48:42.630
they're probably going
to be an AMT, whether you

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:44.840
have a rental property or not.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:50.216
And so there's things you can
do for AMT, to plan for it.

00:48:50.216 --> 00:48:52.100
But just from a
reality standpoint,

00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:54.770
people who live in
California are making

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:57.737
six figures, single
or married, there's

00:48:57.737 --> 00:48:59.195
a very high likelihood
you're going

00:48:59.195 --> 00:49:02.780
to fall into AMT, whether you
have a rental property or even

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:04.031
a primary residence sometimes.

00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:05.405
AMANDA HAN: Yeah,
I mean, I think

00:49:05.405 --> 00:49:07.450
we don't see rental real
estate as an adjustment

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:10.250
either for or against AMT.

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:14.420
For all of us here, the biggest
thing that changes that number

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:15.530
is state taxes.

00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:17.360
And unfortunately,
there's not much you

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:21.337
can do in terms of state tax,
from your W-2 job, at least.

00:49:21.337 --> 00:49:23.420
It's going to be withheld
based on whatever it is.

00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.003
AUDIENCE: The first one is you
mentioned that we can write off

00:49:26.003 --> 00:49:31.310
the cost of, for example,
looking for property to invest,

00:49:31.310 --> 00:49:31.820
right?

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.450
So is this applicable to
foreign countries also?

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:39.370
Or is it only for USA?

00:49:39.370 --> 00:49:42.130
AMANDA HAN: No, it's applicable
to foreign countries as well.

00:49:42.130 --> 00:49:44.980
Now, with any kind
of travel cost,

00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:47.820
the key thing that you want
to make sure you have in place

00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:50.850
is predetermined
business purpose.

00:49:50.850 --> 00:49:52.420
So what we mean by
that is if you're

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.200
going to fly to
Asia, for example,

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.230
you're visiting
family, you happen

00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:58.400
to look at some real
estate, that does not

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.400
make the trip tax deductible.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:04.240
Because you were on a trip and
you happened to do real estate.

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.880
In order for it
to be deductible,

00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.930
you have to have documentation
to show that maybe I scheduled

00:50:09.930 --> 00:50:11.760
these meetings to meet
with these people,

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.809
to look at these properties
before you leave.

00:50:13.809 --> 00:50:16.100
And the reason, if you think
of it from the IRS's side,

00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.800
and say, well, why
did you go to Asia?

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.300
Well, I went there because I
had all these business meetings

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:22.480
that I had pre-scheduled.

00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:26.470
And so that's the same out of
the country, in the country,

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:28.510
going down to
Southern California.

00:50:28.510 --> 00:50:30.640
It's always that same
underlying concept

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:33.530
of what is the
reason I went there?

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.690
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:38.190
So my second question
is how can we

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:44.920
write off the cost on the time
we spend for rental purpose?

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:47.650
It's not like for
home improvement.

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:49.810
We have receipt
but we don't have

00:50:49.810 --> 00:50:51.690
this for the time we spend.

00:50:51.690 --> 00:50:53.440
AMANDA HAN: That's a
really good question.

00:50:53.440 --> 00:50:54.190
We get that a lot.

00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:56.760
Unfortunately, the
answer is not a good one.

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.470
So the way that--

00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:59.682
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: You know,
you asked the right way,

00:50:59.682 --> 00:50:59.990
"How can I?"

00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.140
But--

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:00.440
[LAUGHS]

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.273
AUDIENCE: How can I?

00:51:01.273 --> 00:51:01.809
[LAUGHS]

00:51:01.809 --> 00:51:02.850
AMANDA HAN: So you can't.

00:51:02.850 --> 00:51:04.520
OK, I'll re-answer this.

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:05.600
So you can.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.880
However, you would have to
pick up that same dollar

00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:09.470
amount as income.

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:11.760
So that just means,
for example, if you

00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:14.160
hired me to do your
house improvements,

00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.890
you write off what you pay me.

00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:17.780
But I pick that up
in taxable income,

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:19.040
because I earn the money.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.270
And so if you wanted
to pay yourself,

00:51:21.270 --> 00:51:22.700
you can certainly do that.

00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.440
We don't recommend
it for anyone at all.

00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.080
Because you're just
writing off and picking up

00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.800
income in the same
exact dollar amount.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.240
And I know people would
say, well, I value my time.

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:35.640
Maybe I charge $100 an hour
or $500 an hour to my clients.

00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:37.140
But I can't charge myself.

00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:39.550
I mean, I can, but
it's just a wash.

00:51:39.550 --> 00:51:41.855
So we don't really
factor that as a cost.

00:51:41.855 --> 00:51:43.355
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Similar question

00:51:43.355 --> 00:51:46.155
we get is I donate 10
hours a month to charity

00:51:46.155 --> 00:51:48.204
and I value my time
at $200 an hour.

00:51:48.204 --> 00:51:50.620
So I think I should be able
to take a charitable deduction

00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:52.060
for that value.

00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.562
And unfortunately, you can't.

00:51:54.562 --> 00:51:56.520
AMANDA HAN: But you can
deduct all the supplies

00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:58.995
and travel costs for all
your charitable work.

00:51:58.995 --> 00:52:00.370
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Right, right.

00:52:00.370 --> 00:52:02.830
AUDIENCE: If you have rental
income property in San

00:52:02.830 --> 00:52:07.970
Francisco, and you have tenants
who pay below-market-rate rent,

00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:09.710
is the amount that
you would pay them

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.220
to move out tax deductible?

00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.420
AMANDA HAN: Oh, mhm, yes.

00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:13.950
Yeah.

00:52:13.950 --> 00:52:16.354
So you mean, kind of
like cash for keys?

00:52:16.354 --> 00:52:18.020
When you pay them to
have them move out?

00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:19.380
Yes, that is definitely
a tax deduction.

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:20.120
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:20.530
AMANDA HAN: Yeah.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.750
Unfortunately, we see that
more often than we'd like.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:24.970
[LAUGHS]

00:52:24.970 --> 00:52:26.970
AUDIENCE: So you guys
mentioned that there's not

00:52:26.970 --> 00:52:29.907
real difference in tax
benefits between LLC

00:52:29.907 --> 00:52:32.160
and just holding
it in your name.

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.950
Is that also true if
you're trying to buy

00:52:33.950 --> 00:52:35.790
properties with a
50/50 partnership?

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:40.786
AMANDA HAN: Well, so
it depends on what

00:52:40.786 --> 00:52:42.412
is the intent for the property?

00:52:42.412 --> 00:52:43.370
AUDIENCE: Buy and hold.

00:52:43.370 --> 00:52:45.078
AMANDA HAN: If it's
a rental real estate,

00:52:45.078 --> 00:52:47.890
it's neutral for tax purposes.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.670
Then the only reason
you would have an LLC

00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:54.130
is if you have asset
protection concerns

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.350
with that particular partner.

00:52:55.350 --> 00:52:57.550
So kind of going back to the
other example, with the sister.

00:52:57.550 --> 00:52:58.059
Right?

00:52:58.059 --> 00:52:59.600
My sister, she's
not going to sue me.

00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:00.694
I'm not going to sue her.

00:53:00.694 --> 00:53:02.110
If something were
to happen to me,

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:03.480
we know each other's wishes.

00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:05.590
You might not need it.

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:08.560
If it's with another coworker,
or even a more distant family

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.490
member or friend, you might
want to have a partnership

00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:14.595
if there is an asset protection
concern between the two of you.

00:53:14.595 --> 00:53:15.970
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
Another thing

00:53:15.970 --> 00:53:18.570
I should add to that is one
situation where it might make

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:20.960
a difference is let's
say, you're going

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.650
to buy it individually, 50/50.

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.760
Legally you're probably
going to own it as what's

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.100
called tenants in common.

00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.180
So for tax purposes, that
means you own 50% of it.

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:31.740
You have to report
50% of the income

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:34.150
and report 50% of the expenses.

00:53:34.150 --> 00:53:37.130
Whether or not you actually
collected 50% or not,

00:53:37.130 --> 00:53:38.350
maybe she collected 100%.

00:53:38.350 --> 00:53:40.550
You still have to report 50%.

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:43.010
Now, so let's take that
to the other situation.

00:53:43.010 --> 00:53:47.700
Maybe you want ways to
say, OK, we own it 50/50.

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.970
But I'm going to 75% of
the expenses and the losses

00:53:51.970 --> 00:53:54.410
for the next five
years, until we sell it.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:57.900
Then we'll even it
out in the back end.

00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:01.652
If you want to be able to
do that, then doing an LLC

00:54:01.652 --> 00:54:03.860
would be the way to go,
versus the tenants in common.

00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.340
Because you wouldn't be able to
do that as tenants in common.

00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:07.256
So it kind of depends.

00:54:07.256 --> 00:54:09.820
If you're planning to
share things 50/50, other

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:11.913
than the asset protection,
it makes no difference.

00:54:11.913 --> 00:54:12.581
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:54:12.581 --> 00:54:14.330
AMANDA HAN: I mean,
just one little tidbit

00:54:14.330 --> 00:54:17.090
to throw out-- legal entities,
I know we talked quite a bit

00:54:17.090 --> 00:54:18.120
about that.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:20.320
Timing is also important.

00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:26.010
So for California, the $800
fee is not a pro-rated amount.

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:27.940
Let's say, you felt like,
I do want that asset

00:54:27.940 --> 00:54:30.300
protection from my partner,
we're talking about.

00:54:30.300 --> 00:54:32.316
So now we're close to September.

00:54:32.316 --> 00:54:33.690
Let's say, by the
time you decide

00:54:33.690 --> 00:54:36.310
to go into this deal it's
going to be November.

00:54:36.310 --> 00:54:38.175
And so if you form an
entity in November,

00:54:38.175 --> 00:54:39.826
you're going to pay
$800 for this year.

00:54:39.826 --> 00:54:42.200
And then you're going to pay
another $800 come next year.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.660
So you're really only
getting that benefit

00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.690
for a one-month period.

00:54:46.690 --> 00:54:48.004
So timing is also important.

00:54:48.004 --> 00:54:49.420
If it's the beginning
of the year,

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:51.628
you're pretty sure this is
going to happen, you know,

00:54:51.628 --> 00:54:53.400
I would say, go
ahead and form it.

00:54:53.400 --> 00:54:55.046
But right now, you
just want to be

00:54:55.046 --> 00:54:57.990
cautious of time frame of how
long you're going that benefit,

00:54:57.990 --> 00:55:03.745
before you have to pay
that second round of $800.

00:55:03.745 --> 00:55:05.120
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
A lot of people

00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.625
are doing Airbnb for
some of their rentals.

00:55:07.625 --> 00:55:09.500
Are there any tax benefits
that people aren't

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.027
aware of when they use Airbnb?

00:55:12.027 --> 00:55:13.360
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, I love Airbnb.

00:55:13.360 --> 00:55:17.420
We're seeing so many
clients do Airbnb.

00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.930
I mean, we're not doing
Airbnb with our rentals,

00:55:19.930 --> 00:55:25.280
but I'm definitely seeing really
good profit on the Airbnb side.

00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.910
I think the main item to think
about for short-term rentals

00:55:29.910 --> 00:55:32.300
like that is that they're
treated differently

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.620
for tax purposes,
depending on what

00:55:34.620 --> 00:55:39.620
is the average number of days
that your guests are staying.

00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:43.650
So if you look at 2016,
the year, on average,

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:48.040
if your guests are staying
longer than seven days--

00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:50.760
meaning eight days
or more-- then it's

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:53.600
treated like a regular rental
property, which is great.

00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:56.330
Because we get all
the depreciation.

00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:59.020
It's rental income.

00:55:59.020 --> 00:56:03.450
Now, on the other hand, if the
average is seven days or less,

00:56:03.450 --> 00:56:06.220
then it's actually treated
like a hotel business.

00:56:06.220 --> 00:56:08.730
Which means it's
ordinary income,

00:56:08.730 --> 00:56:11.240
potentially subject to
self-employment taxes, payroll

00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:12.077
taxes.

00:56:12.077 --> 00:56:14.160
So there definitely is
planning involved if you're

00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:16.620
doing short-term rental stuff.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:19.200
Depending on how
significant the income is,

00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:21.600
that might be one of
those rare situations

00:56:21.600 --> 00:56:24.640
where we would
recommend a Corporation

00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.236
for that particular real estate.

00:56:27.236 --> 00:56:29.410
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
But yeah, again, we're

00:56:29.410 --> 00:56:30.910
seeing it as a great
business model.

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:32.618
Because people are
getting better returns

00:56:32.618 --> 00:56:35.220
on renting the exact same
property that they used

00:56:35.220 --> 00:56:38.050
to rent for a 12-month
period of time to one tenant,

00:56:38.050 --> 00:56:40.380
they're renting to 35
different people over the year

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:42.980
and making a lot more money.

00:56:42.980 --> 00:56:46.349
And it's not just the properties
that are next to Disneyland.

00:56:46.349 --> 00:56:47.890
It's markets you
wouldn't even expect

00:56:47.890 --> 00:56:50.010
to be "vacation" markets.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.430
But they're finding
enough demand for it.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:54.534
So it's really working
out well for most people.

00:56:54.534 --> 00:56:56.450
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Have
they had the strategies

00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:58.032
that have been proven fruitful?

00:56:58.032 --> 00:56:59.990
Because I know there's
people who have done it,

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:03.010
but there might be a
lot of work involved,

00:57:03.010 --> 00:57:05.990
getting tenants in there,
might be more upkeep?

00:57:05.990 --> 00:57:09.060
AMANDA HAN: You know,
I have a client up here

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:14.200
who was targeting more
like the corporate guests.

00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:17.537
So he said, that's worked
out well for him, just

00:57:17.537 --> 00:57:19.870
from people coming from out
of town to do training here.

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:21.540
So when they're
here, they're here

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.150
for a couple weeks at a time,
instead of just a couple days

00:57:25.150 --> 00:57:26.404
here and there.

00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:28.320
But yeah, we have people
who actually move out

00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:29.236
of their primary home.

00:57:29.236 --> 00:57:31.832
I have a client in Hollywood.

00:57:31.832 --> 00:57:33.540
So he's essentially
moved out of his home

00:57:33.540 --> 00:57:35.570
because it was so much
more profitable for him

00:57:35.570 --> 00:57:38.440
to rent it out on the Airbnb.

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.120
Now he's living in
a rented apartment.

00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.820
And then his home,
he's renting it out.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.820
JORDAN THIBODEAU: From
Chris-- "My understanding

00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:50.390
is that deductible rental losses
phase out at $150,000 of income

00:57:50.390 --> 00:57:52.840
if not pursuing real
estate as a career.

00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.060
Do most wealthy individuals
accept this fact

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.370
and wait until the sale of a
property and apply the loss?

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:01.510
Or are there other workarounds
for this limitation?"

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:03.260
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
It's a great question.

00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:06.814
So just to kind
of paraphrase it,

00:58:06.814 --> 00:58:08.230
we were talking
earlier about when

00:58:08.230 --> 00:58:09.720
we have cash-flow
positive properties,

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:11.094
but if we can get
enough expenses

00:58:11.094 --> 00:58:13.510
and get a loss on paper
for that rental property?

00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:15.720
Well, the IRS will say, yes,
you can deduct that loss

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.470
against your other income.

00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:21.940
But if your income gets to
be $150,000 or more per year,

00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:24.845
that takes away your ability
to deduct that loss this year.

00:58:24.845 --> 00:58:26.470
Now, you get to carry
forward the loss.

00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:27.600
You don't lose it.

00:58:27.600 --> 00:58:29.433
And that's what the
question's referring to.

00:58:29.433 --> 00:58:31.981
Do people just wait around
and use it in the year

00:58:31.981 --> 00:58:33.730
that they sell the
property down the road?

00:58:33.730 --> 00:58:36.862
And that's what some people do.

00:58:36.862 --> 00:58:38.570
Another option is
people actually started

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.500
reinvesting money to
generating better cash flow

00:58:41.500 --> 00:58:44.470
properties that they have
positive income on the tax

00:58:44.470 --> 00:58:46.220
return, that they can
utilize their losses

00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:49.020
from the other properties
to offset that.

00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.170
That's one avenue
we've seen people do.

00:58:52.170 --> 00:58:54.460
Or become a real
estate professional,

00:58:54.460 --> 00:58:57.290
where going forward, that
limitation goes out the window.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:59.517
Because now you are in
the day-to-day business,

00:58:59.517 --> 00:59:02.100
whether it's you, or maybe your
spouse or something like that.

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.750
So it's an unfortunate
limitation,

00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:08.290
because it's been
in place since 1986,

00:59:08.290 --> 00:59:09.922
and the numbers haven't changed.

00:59:09.922 --> 00:59:13.362
And it's crazy because
obviously in California, you

00:59:13.362 --> 00:59:16.272
can get to that income pretty
quickly for a lot of people.

00:59:16.272 --> 00:59:18.100
AMANDA HAN: Yeah.

00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:22.617
And you know, the person that
asked the question mentioned,

00:59:22.617 --> 00:59:24.700
besides the fact, that you
could do it if you have

00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:26.337
real estate as your career.

00:59:26.337 --> 00:59:28.170
I think that that's a
little bit misleading.

00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:30.000
Because to be a real
estate professional,

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.030
it does not mean you have to
become a realtor or broker

00:59:33.030 --> 00:59:34.570
or get licensed.

00:59:34.570 --> 00:59:38.786
Real estate professional is only
a term used in the tax world.

00:59:38.786 --> 00:59:40.160
And that simply
means that you're

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.020
spending more time
in real estate

00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:44.200
than you are at your jobs.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:47.060
So now if you guys are
working full time here,

00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:48.190
that means 40 hours a week.

00:59:48.190 --> 00:59:49.260
So to be a real
estate professional,

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:50.843
you got to be working
41 hours a week.

00:59:50.843 --> 00:59:52.950
So yes, that is very hard.

00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:55.340
But what if you have
a stay-at-home spouse?

00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:57.790
If you had a stay-at-home
spouse and they're just

00:59:57.790 --> 01:00:00.850
really watching the kids, doing
household things, then really,

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:02.600
for them to be a real
estate professional,

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:06.460
they only have to spend at
least 750 hours in real estate.

01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.180
And once they reach that
goal, then collectively,

01:00:10.180 --> 01:00:13.380
you guys get to use the
benefits of the rental losses

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.450
in this guy's situation.

01:00:15.450 --> 01:00:16.770
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:19.140
AMANDA HAN: The question is
how do you document the time

01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:20.980
that you're incurring?

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:24.600
So the IRS doesn't have
a specific requirement.

01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.650
They don't have a form
or anything like that.

01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:29.700
The only thing they require
is a consistent methodology.

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.081
Meaning if you use
a notepad, they

01:00:32.081 --> 01:00:34.080
want you to use that
notepad for the whole year.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.130
Or if going to be your calendar,
something written in Excel,

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:40.080
it just has to be consistent.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.142
Really, the time tracking
doesn't get sent to anywhere.

01:00:43.142 --> 01:00:45.600
For our clients who claim real
estate, we don't look at it.

01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:48.230
We don't audit
that kind of stuff.

01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:50.580
The only time you will
be required to produce it

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.157
is if you were to be
audited by the IRS.

01:00:53.157 --> 01:00:54.740
Let's say you were
selected for audit.

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:56.720
And they say, well,
I'm really not sure

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.240
if you qualify as real estate.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.407
I want to see your time log.

01:00:59.407 --> 01:01:01.656
And what they'll do, is
they'll look at your time log.

01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:03.960
It might have hundreds of
entries for the whole year,

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:04.580
right?

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:05.990
And then what they'll
do is they'll go through

01:01:05.990 --> 01:01:08.046
and they'll do what's
called sample selection.

01:01:08.046 --> 01:01:09.420
They're going to
say, OK you said

01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:13.380
you spent two hours at Google,
listening to a real estate tax

01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.160
talk.

01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.220
Prove it.

01:01:15.220 --> 01:01:17.960
So hopefully you have
something-- an e-mail,

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.070
or your coworkers can vouch
for you-- that you were here.

01:01:22.070 --> 01:01:26.430
In audits that we've dealt
with, thankfully, the agents

01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:29.150
on the IRS's side have
been pretty reasonable,

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:31.140
in that they would
select things that they

01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:32.520
think could be proven.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.930
So that would mean you went
to Colorado for a real estate

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:36.610
conference for three days.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.510
OK, you should have something
that showed me you were there

01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:41.460
doing the real estate seminar.

01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.960
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
So really you're

01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:45.580
trying to keep of
a date, obviously,

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.480
a description of what you
do, a description of who

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.712
you met with, what you
talked about, obviously

01:01:50.712 --> 01:01:51.920
the amount of time you spent.

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.810
Those are the most
important aspects of it.

01:01:54.810 --> 01:01:56.816
And again, however
you keep of it,

01:01:56.816 --> 01:01:58.690
it doesn't matter as
long at it's consistent.

01:01:58.690 --> 01:02:00.710
AUDIENCE: What
happens if the wife is

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:04.850
an accountant in a
private family firm which

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:06.210
mainly deals in real estate?

01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:10.210
Does that count as real
estate professional?

01:02:10.210 --> 01:02:11.960
AMANDA HAN: That's a
really good question.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.209
And the answer is, it depends.

01:02:13.209 --> 01:02:14.570
[LAUGHS]

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:15.390
It depends.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:21.930
So if she has a significant
ownership in the business,

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:23.260
then potentially.

01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:25.770
But if she's maybe working
for her parents or something

01:02:25.770 --> 01:02:28.870
like that, then
the answer is no.

01:02:28.870 --> 01:02:31.290
This example, the
most common times

01:02:31.290 --> 01:02:33.930
we see this example is
with a W-2 employee.

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:37.910
Maybe you're working for a
property management company.

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:38.880
You're a W-2.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:40.320
Does that time count?

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:43.330
And the answer is no, if you
are not a significant owner

01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:44.550
of that company.

01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:47.509
Yes, if you own that
property management company.

01:02:47.509 --> 01:02:49.550
That is your real estate
time, even though you're

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:52.060
managing for other people.

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.110
AUDIENCE: For the
self-directed 401Ks, can

01:02:56.110 --> 01:02:59.160
you advise what your clients
maybe use as the custodials?

01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:01.170
Because sometimes some
of the bigger firms,

01:03:01.170 --> 01:03:04.060
like Pensco or whatnot,
charge a lot of fees.

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:07.650
And I see a trend where they
have these IRA check books.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:10.950
And I'm concerned that could
get me into some legal issues,

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:14.560
because I don't
know all the rules.

01:03:14.560 --> 01:03:16.630
AMANDA HAN: So in the
self-directed arena,

01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:19.460
if you Google
self-directed, there's

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:22.910
going to be hundreds
of names that pop up.

01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:25.950
But yes, I do agree, Pensco is
one of the more reputable ones.

01:03:25.950 --> 01:03:28.690
They're larger so the fees
are a little bit higher.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:31.940
But yeah, the question with
how do you find good CPAs,

01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:35.527
I would look through your
network here, bigger pockets.

01:03:35.527 --> 01:03:37.360
People will share with
you their experience,

01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:41.620
maybe paperwork took too
long or all kinds of stuff.

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:45.400
With respect to
the checkbook IRA,

01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.610
it's really
convenient for people

01:03:47.610 --> 01:03:50.370
who maybe need to write
checks out all the time.

01:03:50.370 --> 01:03:52.364
The most common times
we see that is-- I mean,

01:03:52.364 --> 01:03:54.530
we don't have a lot of
clients that do that anymore,

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:55.946
but-- back in the
days when people

01:03:55.946 --> 01:03:57.920
used to go out and bid
at the trustee sales,

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.284
they need to have cash
to buy the property.

01:04:00.284 --> 01:04:01.700
So that's where
it comes in handy.

01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:03.390
Because Pensco is
not going to give you

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:05.230
a check within the
next five minutes.

01:04:05.230 --> 01:04:07.300
So you do want to
have that flexibility.

01:04:07.300 --> 01:04:11.920
Now, if you're looking to
use your self-directed money

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.900
to do traditional
real estate, like buy

01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.130
a rental property, or
maybe doing hard money

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:19.130
lending, where you're
lending to other investors,

01:04:19.130 --> 01:04:23.122
we recommend against
doing the checkbook IRA,

01:04:23.122 --> 01:04:24.830
for the same exact
reason you brought up.

01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.160
Unless you are someone
very well versed

01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:30.060
in the rules of self-directed,
it's very easy for you

01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.190
to get yourself in trouble.

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:33.040
Because when you use
that, we don't see it.

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.940
There's no custodian
that sees it.

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:38.980
So it's just more
open to mishaps.

01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:40.670
The other thing
is, Matt and I went

01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:44.600
to a self-directed training
a couple years ago,

01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.470
where one of the
directors from the IRS

01:04:46.470 --> 01:04:48.269
was one of the speakers.

01:04:48.269 --> 01:04:49.810
And they did say,
that there is going

01:04:49.810 --> 01:04:53.242
to be a heavier effort on their
end to audit these checkbook

01:04:53.242 --> 01:04:55.946
IRAs for that exact reason.

01:04:55.946 --> 01:04:57.820
They know that's a lot
of money, potentially,

01:04:57.820 --> 01:05:00.520
they can come after, if you make
a small mistake by accident.

01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:02.920
Because with self directed,
like we were saying earlier,

01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:04.750
you can invest in almost
anything you want.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:07.140
But there's a lot of
things that you "can't do,"

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.515
even after you get
your investment.

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:11.690
So it's supposed to be a
retirement account where

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:15.670
you kind of let it do its thing,
for lack of a better term.

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:17.160
So there's a lot
of things you've

01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:18.410
got to keep your hands off of.

01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:22.290
And that's where there's a lot
of abuse right now, I think.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:25.360
AUDIENCE: So I bought
a property recently.

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.190
And I had cash just
that I had saved.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:33.080
And I wanted to invest outside
of the stock and bonds,

01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:34.835
so just diversify.

01:05:34.835 --> 01:05:36.460
And then the big
question is, well, you

01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:40.550
buy a place for like, in this
case, it was $1.1 million.

01:05:40.550 --> 01:05:43.669
And then how much
cash do you put down?

01:05:43.669 --> 01:05:45.710
You don't really want to
take too much of a loss,

01:05:45.710 --> 01:05:48.630
because we can't write
it off as let's say,

01:05:48.630 --> 01:05:50.220
as good income earners.

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:53.010
But then you don't want to
be paying money out of pocket

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:54.150
every month either.

01:05:54.150 --> 01:05:58.305
So I just took a ballpark and
said, well, I'll put down 50%.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:04.230
And I'll get a loan
on the other 50%.

01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:07.120
And that would
basically break even.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:11.120
And I'm just
wondering, I usually

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.350
go with the 50/50 strategy.

01:06:12.350 --> 01:06:14.306
But what do you
recommend in this case?

01:06:14.306 --> 01:06:16.180
Of course now I have a
lot of capital tied up

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.793
into one property.

01:06:17.793 --> 01:06:19.060
AMANDA HAN: Yeah.

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:20.840
I think it really depends.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.590
I mean, the answer's
going to be different

01:06:22.590 --> 01:06:23.700
for every single person.

01:06:23.700 --> 01:06:28.560
So for you, the options
would be to put less down

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:30.105
and carry more debt.

01:06:30.105 --> 01:06:33.785
So if you did that, instead
of putting 50%, if you put 20%

01:06:33.785 --> 01:06:35.790
and you did two
rental properties,

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:37.305
what would be the
return on that?

01:06:37.305 --> 01:06:42.020
It's a higher risk because you
have more debt to worry about.

01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:44.120
So the risk tolerance
level does come into play.

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.040
We were talking about
that earlier at lunch.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.774
And so I think at the end the
day, for me as an investor,

01:06:51.774 --> 01:06:52.690
I look at the numbers.

01:06:52.690 --> 01:06:54.650
I look at the worst-case
scenario for me.

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:56.800
And I would say, OK, in
the worst-case scenario,

01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.420
would I be OK?

01:06:57.420 --> 01:06:58.870
Would I be able
to carry this debt

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:00.450
on this particular property?

01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:03.309
And if that answer is yes,
then I'm comfortable with it.

01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:05.350
We have a lot of clients
that are more high risk.

01:07:05.350 --> 01:07:06.570
They want to put
the minimum down.

01:07:06.570 --> 01:07:08.640
They want to get as many
properties as possible.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.196
Maybe because
they're really young,

01:07:10.196 --> 01:07:11.279
they're just starting out.

01:07:11.279 --> 01:07:13.440
They feel like this is the
time to take the gamble.

01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:14.898
Don't want to wait
until I'm almost

01:07:14.898 --> 01:07:16.325
retiring to take that gamble.

01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:18.325
So those are the factors
that you're looking at.

01:07:18.325 --> 01:07:23.490
I don't think there's a correct
answer to 20% versus 50%.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.770
AUDIENCE: Well, I mean, one
thing I think we all see

01:07:25.770 --> 01:07:27.950
here is it's pretty
difficult to buy,

01:07:27.950 --> 01:07:31.650
let's say, rental properties
and even break even.

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.900
It's just the factors aren't
here, especially in California.

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:38.320
So I know it's kind of
outside of tax advice.

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.630
But where do you see your
active real estate investors,

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:43.220
or buy and hold real
estate investors,

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:45.730
where are they buying
now, to make numbers

01:07:45.730 --> 01:07:47.750
add up to where you said?

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.904
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: We
have a lot of clients

01:07:49.904 --> 01:07:51.510
buy throughout the countries.

01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:54.810
So we've got a lot of
clients that buy in Texas,

01:07:54.810 --> 01:07:58.265
Georgia, Tennessee, Ohio.

01:07:58.265 --> 01:07:59.682
AMANDA HAN: Yeah, Ohio.

01:07:59.682 --> 01:08:01.640
I mean, I don't know the
market in Ohio at all.

01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:03.806
But yes, I have a lot of
people that have cashed out

01:08:03.806 --> 01:08:05.640
of California, going into Ohio.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:07.497
I think that good
and bad is they

01:08:07.497 --> 01:08:09.080
take the appreciation
from California,

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:10.950
and they move to Ohio.

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:13.670
There, there's probably not
going to be much appreciation.

01:08:13.670 --> 01:08:15.290
but what they're
getting is cash flow.

01:08:15.290 --> 01:08:16.762
So that's a personal question.

01:08:16.762 --> 01:08:17.970
What's more important to you?

01:08:17.970 --> 01:08:20.095
Do you need the cash flow
to live off of right now?

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:20.689
Probably not.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:23.290
So would you rather
have the appreciation?

01:08:23.290 --> 01:08:25.960
Another area that we have
a lot of clients going into

01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.910
is Florida.

01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:28.810
So from what I hear,
our clients that

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:31.155
are full-time active
real estate investors,

01:08:31.155 --> 01:08:34.890
it sounds like Florida today
is kind of where California

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:36.452
was maybe two, three years ago.

01:08:36.452 --> 01:08:37.910
So people are still
flipping there.

01:08:37.910 --> 01:08:39.159
They're still doing wholesale.

01:08:39.159 --> 01:08:41.890
Wholesale is almost
impossible to get here.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:43.090
Because there's no margins.

01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:44.050
AUDIENCE: What's wholesale?

01:08:44.050 --> 01:08:45.970
AMANDA HAN: Wholesale
is when I get a property

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:48.630
under contract at a good price.

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:50.784
And then maybe I
wholesale it to you.

01:08:50.784 --> 01:08:52.950
You buy it and then you
either turn it into a rental

01:08:52.950 --> 01:08:54.340
or you're going to
do a fix and flip,

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:55.290
and you're going to rehab it.

01:08:55.290 --> 01:08:56.620
MATTHEW MACFARLAND:
And she gets a--

01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:56.859
AMANDA HAN: And I
get a wholesale fee.

01:08:56.859 --> 01:08:59.404
MATTHEW MACFARLAND: --$5,000
wholesale fee for doing

01:08:59.404 --> 01:09:00.529
the transaction, basically.

01:09:00.529 --> 01:09:01.649
AMANDA HAN: Kind of
like a finder's fee.

01:09:01.649 --> 01:09:03.720
So those kind of deals
only work when there's

01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.160
a healthy margin in the profit.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:09.010
That's why we don't really see
a ton of that in California.

01:09:09.010 --> 01:09:10.649
But yeah, some of
those other states,

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:13.701
like Matt mentioned, Georgia,
Tennessee, Texas, Florida,

01:09:13.701 --> 01:09:15.197
Ohio.

01:09:15.197 --> 01:09:17.155
AUDIENCE: For someone
who's always just kind of

01:09:17.155 --> 01:09:19.069
bought Turbo Tax and
winged it, can you

01:09:19.069 --> 01:09:22.229
talk a little bit about what
a typical interaction is

01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:24.569
with a CPA, like, aside
from just filing taxes?

01:09:24.569 --> 01:09:26.753
What kind of time
and expense is there

01:09:26.753 --> 01:09:28.711
throughout the year, and
planning and strategy,

01:09:28.711 --> 01:09:31.443
and stuff like that?

01:09:31.443 --> 01:09:33.109
AMANDA HAN: I think
it's going to differ

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.560
with every single firm.

01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:37.880
For us, our emphasis is on
tax planning side of things.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:41.300
So we have clients that come to
us for planning and tax return.

01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:45.710
Or we have clients that come
to us just for planning.

01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:49.170
So like I said earlier, the
planning part-- if you've never

01:09:49.170 --> 01:09:52.700
done planning before, if
you've always done it yourself,

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.620
I highly recommend you invest
the time and the energy

01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:59.270
to do at least one comprehensive
planning so you have a roadmap

01:09:59.270 --> 01:10:02.350
to follow on what some of
those high-level items are.

01:10:02.350 --> 01:10:06.240
But the reality is
that is going to be

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.720
kind of a living document.

01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:10.070
Because today you have
these sets of rentals.

01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:12.670
Tomorrow you might go
into a multifamily.

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.140
And so the strategy
itself will be changing

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:16.540
throughout the years as well.

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.540
I think the most effective
planning is really

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.410
just open communication,
as easy as that sounds.

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.220
Because really, the
goal is not for you

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.990
guys to understand everything
there is to know about taxes,

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:30.080
and be updated with all the
various tax changes that

01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.170
come out during the year.

01:10:31.170 --> 01:10:33.050
That's your CPA's job.

01:10:33.050 --> 01:10:36.170
But your job, really, is just
to keep them updated on anything

01:10:36.170 --> 01:10:37.721
that you think
might be changing.

01:10:37.721 --> 01:10:38.720
I might be buying a car.

01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.100
I might be getting married.

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:41.310
I might be getting a divorce.

01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:44.120
Those are times when there
could be a lot of money

01:10:44.120 --> 01:10:47.050
at play, shifting of money.

01:10:47.050 --> 01:10:50.370
That's the times when they will
be able to help and guide you

01:10:50.370 --> 01:10:53.735
on what are some of the
things to keep in mind.

01:10:53.735 --> 01:10:55.110
JORDAN THIBODEAU:
Well, thank you

01:10:55.110 --> 01:10:56.704
very much for coming through.

01:10:56.704 --> 01:10:57.370
AMANDA HAN: Yes.

01:10:57.370 --> 01:10:59.250
JORDAN THIBODEAU: You guys
flew from Irvine to join us.

01:10:59.250 --> 01:11:01.160
So my final question
is, are you going

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.924
to be deducting that expense?

01:11:02.924 --> 01:11:03.840
AMANDA HAN: Of course.

01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:05.860
[LAUGHS]

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.989
So for trips like
this, we basically

01:11:08.989 --> 01:11:11.030
don't even leave the house
with our personal car.

01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:12.946
We just leave our house
with the business car.

01:11:12.946 --> 01:11:15.260
Because everything here is
going to be tax deductible.

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:16.430
JORDAN THIBODEAU: Excellent.

01:11:16.430 --> 01:11:18.199
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:18.199 --> 01:11:20.240
JORDAN THIBODEAU: I'm
going to send their contact

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.736
information out after the talk.

01:11:21.736 --> 01:11:23.277
But what we're going
to do real quick

01:11:23.277 --> 01:11:24.830
is give them a round of
applause for coming through,

01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:25.280
and thank them.

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:25.880
So thank you.

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:26.796
AMANDA HAN: Thank you.

01:11:26.796 --> 01:11:29.292
[APPLAUSE]
