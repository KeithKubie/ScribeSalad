Let's continue our work with functions. There are basic operations we can

00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:09.016
perform with functions. We can add them, subtract them, multiply them, and

00:00:09.016 --> 00:00:13.700
divide them. We can even do something called the composition of functions, and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.002
we'll look at that later in this lesson. For now let's start with these two

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:25.360
functions: f of x equals 3 x plus 2 and g of x equals x squared minus 1.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.410
Remember that x is the input for our function. It's what we can change, and

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.726
input any number in here. F of x is the output for this function. It's the

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:38.953
result that we get when we plug in x. And similarly, g of x is the output for

00:00:38.953 --> 00:00:44.773
this function. It's the result we get for whatever number we plug in for x. So,

00:00:44.773 --> 00:00:50.030
based on what you know about evaluating functions, what is f of 2? Write that

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.778
here. Then what's g of 2? Put that one here. And then use what you know about f

00:00:55.778 --> 00:01:02.356
of 2 and g of 2 to figure out this question. What's f plus g of 2? Write that

00:01:02.356 --> 00:01:06.724
one here. Now, I know we haven't covered what this means yet, but I think you

00:01:06.724 --> 00:01:08.420
can figure it out.
