Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to--

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.680
Audience: Shh!

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.840
NC: Sorry, I'm kinda in the middle of a wedding.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.580

[Gunshots]

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.560
We are here to join these two beloved,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.840
Devil Boner, and Hyper Fan--

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:05.260
Where is she, anyway?

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.220
Devil Boner: Oh, she wanted to wait for the video to start so she could walk down the aisle.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.640
OK, bone puncher!

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:21.560

Benny: She looks beautiful.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.540
Devil Boner: Yeah, instead of walking down the aisle with her father, she chose to walk with that glowy effect.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:36.880
[Ethereal music continues]

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.240
Santa Christ: Here to witness this union is Benny, Devil Boner's best man...

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:43.740
Devil Boner: Yeah, but not best shot, though.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.940

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.040
Um...

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.320
NC: I think the term we're going with is "butler of honor".

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.600
Santa Christ: OK, cool, whatevs.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:55.960
The rings, please.

Audience: [Blubbering]

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.560
Santa Christ: Our dearly committed have decided to write their own vows.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.220
Devil Boner: I want you.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.000
Hyper Fangirl: I want you.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.560
Santa Christ: Then by the power invested in me,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.160
by me,

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.660
I now pronounce you psycho husband and stalker wife.

Devil Boner: Hey, seeing how this is a convention and we're already clearly liquored up,

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.020
let's just have the reception here!

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.700

Chester A. Bum: Mazel tov, mazel tov.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.160
Doe: So, how does it feel to officially be "Hyper Boner"?

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.060
Hyper Fangirl: As excited as the name sounds.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.340
Chester A. Bum: Oh, that's wonderful!

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.140
Now, if you'll excuse us, we're gonna see if the flowers are smokeable.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.980
Doe: I already did! THEY ARE!

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.360
Chester A. Bum: Oh my God, this is the greatest day of my life!

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.300
The Devil: I'll admit, I didn't think Hyper Boner was a good idea.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.300
But after seeing all the joy displayed, it's clear that Hyper Boner is going to last a long time.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.380
Devil Boner: Ain't it the truth?

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:27.720
The Devil: Nice suit.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:28.600

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.980
Hyper Fangirl: Incredibly up!

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.120
Uncle Lies: Whenever anybody sees you, they'll say, "You can't keep Hyper Boner down."

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.360
Devil Boner: For years to come.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.980
Uncle Lies: Yeah, that's about what we predicted.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.400
NC: You know, sometimes, a name can spark a lot of possibilities.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.680
There's been so many films and shows that suggest that something is going to be amazing, just based on the title alone.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.420
Some of them work, some of them don't,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.500
and then, there's movies that thought of the name first and clearly wrote around it.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.440
You know where I'm going with this.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.600
Chipwrecked is the third in the questioning-humanity film series based on Alvin and the Chipmunks,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.160
and, if you can believe it, it's not the last.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.740
By this point, it's made clear that a bad pun is literally enough to throw millions of dollars into a film shoot,

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.640
exploiting kids' inability to say no to shit.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.920
It's just as phoned-in and tired as you would think, but why generalize when we can go into more detail?

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.340
Well, I can think of a lot of reasons,

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.720
but if I'm allowed to leave a wedding early so I don't have to listen to any more Hyper Boner jokes,

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.000
I guess I can suffer for you.

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.180
This is Chipwrecked.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.940
The film knows parents want to go home as quickly as possible,

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.180
so it jumps right into it with barely an opening at all,

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.600
which is fitting because this is barely a movie at all.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.160
Dave: Where have I been? Trying to board the ship.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.560
NC: It's not easy looking older and sadder with every passing film.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.420
So they're going on a family vacation and...

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.820
Nope, that's all the setup we get. We don't even know where they're sailing to.

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.800

High-pitched NC: Attention, attention, the moon landing was fake and Earth is flat!

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.460

Was this Take 8 they're pretending they're excited about a table with nothing on it?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.280

I don't care that you called filming this the most unpleasant experience of your career.

as they all sit down to think about what they've been through.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.000
Zoe: Jeanette...

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.400
I-- I don't know what to say.

00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.560
I'm really sorry.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.220
Jeanette: Well, apology accepted.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:28.980
NC: Okay, people are WAY too forgiving of attempted murder in these films.

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.960
Can't there be like a...

00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:30.920
[Slap]

00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:31.620
...something?

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:33.920
Alvin: Umm, Dave?

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:35.700
Dave: Yes, Alvin?

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:37.960
Alvin: I just wanted to say...

00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:39.900
NC as Alvin: Life lesson you were trying to teach me learned.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.660
NC as Dave: Parallel life lesson you were trying to teach me learned.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.500
NC as either Brittany or Eleanor: Look! Cop-out plot device wrapping up things too well!

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:46.000
[Yelling]

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.420
Ian: It's me, Ian Hawke! Jett Records!

00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:50.740
NC as pilot: [Inhale] Pass. Keep flyin'!

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:54.160
NC: They, of course, make it in time for the Music Awards...

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.360
We never actually figure out if they win anything.

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.500
I'm just assuming no, just get Cross as your agent...

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.720
and the credits mercifully roll.

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.660
So that was Chipwrecked.

00:19:03.660 --> 00:19:05.980
It was tough to get through, and when you really think ab--

00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.760
Wait-wait-wait, we're still going?! We're still going?!?!

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.800
Stewardess played by Phyllis Smith: I'm sorry, sir. We're gonna have to gate-check those.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.420
Dave: Are you gonna charge me 25 bucks a bag?

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.320
NC: Bullshit, man! WE HAD A DEAL!

00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.240
You roll the credits, we get to go!!

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:18.580
What the hell is left to show, the Chipmunks eating shawarma?!

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.080
Stewardess: Sir, please return to your seat. We're about to take off.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:21.840
Dave: But he--

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.340
Stewardess: Sit!

00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.560
NC as Stewardess Phyllis Smith: As an actress from an actual good CGI film, I hold superiority.

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.760
Dave: No-no-NO!

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:29.460
[CRASH!]

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.140
NC as Dave: That almost killed my stuntman!

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.460
Dave: AAAAAAAAALLLLLVIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINNN!!!!!

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.280
NC as Alvin: [Screaming while freefalling from the plane]

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:40.040
NC: And THAT, finally, is Chipwrecked.

00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.840
And I have to give them credit: It lived up to what it promised.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.580
It felt like I was watching people thrown off a ship and slowly die.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:52.800
It's such a rushed cash-in that's not even disguising how much of a rushed cash-in it is.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.440
It has nothing for adults,

00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.600
what it has for kids, you could get off of a children's screensaver,

00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:59.360
it's totally devoid of charm!

00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.220
That is, again, for David Cross.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.280
Yeah, I have to give credit: I always enjoy seeing him in these films.

00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:06.460
Despite him clearly being above this material,

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:10.080
he is the only one who can get a smile out of me with some of these awful lines.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.920
Aside from that, though, it's best to leave this piece of driftwood washed up on shore.

00:20:16.860 --> 00:20:22.200
And it just goes to show: you can't really turn out anything of value when your base is nothing but a bad pun.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.300
Devil Boner: Thank you, thank you. I can see Hyper Boner lasting a long time, too.

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:28.720
Hyper Fangirl: I'm really having second thoughts about this "Hyper Boner" thing.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:29.500
Devil Boner: Big time, yeah.

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:32.060
Hyper Fangirl: I love your name, but I just don't think that it works for me.

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:32.820
Devil: Boner: Yeah...

00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:34.000
Wait a minute...

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.680
What if yours wasn't the last name that changed?

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:37.940
Hyper Fangirl: What are you saying, Honeybottoms?

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:38.920
Devil Boner: I'm saying...

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.480
that from this day on...

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.340
I SHALL BE KNOWN AS...

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.740
Devil Fangirl.

00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:47.580
Hyper Fangirl: Don't do that.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:48.500
Devil Boner: Oh, thank God.

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.580
You know, I really didn't want to. Uh, I was just gonna do it to make you happy.

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:53.000
Hyper Fangirl: Let's just keep our last names.

00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:56.400
Devil Boner: Whatever keeps you just the way you are is fine by me.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.920
Hyper Fangirl: Come on! Let's consummate our marriage the way that most newlyweds do!

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:02.140
Devil Boner: You mean by passing out because this sucked the life out of us?!

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.180
Hyper Fangirl: Yuh-uh!
Devil Boner: YOU GOT IT!!

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.160
[Thud!]

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:06.360
Hyper Fangirl: Is your ring on the wrong finger?

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.540
Devil Boner: I'm too tired to notice.

00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:52.380
["The Review Must Go On"]

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:58.620
Ian: Hate, anger, regret. Those aren't just members of a girl group I once signed.
