if you're not sure exactly if it's

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050
if you're not sure exactly if it's
 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.870
if you're not sure exactly if it's
useful if it's necessary put it in the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880
useful if it's necessary put it in the
 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.850
useful if it's necessary put it in the
box so if you're all of a sudden looking

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860
box so if you're all of a sudden looking
 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.740
box so if you're all of a sudden looking
for a cord you could think ah I bet I

00:01:59.740 --> 00:01:59.750
for a cord you could think ah I bet I
 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.630
for a cord you could think ah I bet I

favorite clutter clearing tips is

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450
favorite clutter clearing tips is
 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.759
favorite clutter clearing tips is
something that I figured out for myself

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:12.769
something that I figured out for myself
 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.500
something that I figured out for myself
because I noticed that sometimes I'd be

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510
because I noticed that sometimes I'd be
 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.239
because I noticed that sometimes I'd be
like walking through my house or looking

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:16.249
like walking through my house or looking
 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:17.619
like walking through my house or looking
through a clause that are recovered and

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629
through a clause that are recovered and
 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:18.110
through a clause that are recovered and
I

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120
I
 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.030
I
I think should I get rid of this and I

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
I think should I get rid of this and I
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.530
I think should I get rid of this and I
would ponder it and then I'd be like I

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540
would ponder it and then I'd be like I
 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.470
would ponder it and then I'd be like I
guess I'll keep it and then I you know

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480
guess I'll keep it and then I you know
 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.149
guess I'll keep it and then I you know
some time would go by and then I'd find

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159
some time would go by and then I'd find
 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.890
some time would go by and then I'd find
myself walking by and I think do I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900
myself walking by and I think do I
 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.830
myself walking by and I think do I
really need this I think I'll keep it

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840
really need this I think I'll keep it
 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.470
really need this I think I'll keep it
and now I'm like probably I should have

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480
and now I'm like probably I should have
 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.089
and now I'm like probably I should have
gotten rid of it the first time it

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099
gotten rid of it the first time it
 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.610
gotten rid of it the first time it
occurred to me but now if it's occurred

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620
occurred to me but now if it's occurred
 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.979
occurred to me but now if it's occurred
to me three times that I should toss

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989
to me three times that I should toss
 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.750
to me three times that I should toss
something recycle something or give

one thing to think about as you're
clearing clutter is can you put the

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129
clearing clutter is can you put the
 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.360
