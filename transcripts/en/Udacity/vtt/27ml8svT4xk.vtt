00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:05.031
So we've seen we can create derive classes and they inherit attributes from

00:00:05.031 --> 00:00:09.208
their base class. We can create another derive class. We'll make a BlackBear and

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:13.602
we can add attributes to our derived classes. So we'll give the BlackBear a

00:00:13.602 --> 00:00:18.470
climb_tree method and a chase method. Here's what the BlackBear code looks like.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.433
It's base class is Bear. It's got two additional methods to find, the climb_tree

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:26.832
method and the chase method. And in the chase method, we'll use climb_tree. We

00:00:26.832 --> 00:00:31.870
also use eat. Since BlackBear doesn't define eat, it will inherit the eat method

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.762
from the base class, and we'll be using the bear's eat method. Yummy, yummy,

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:40.225
yummy. So let's see how that works. We create our human victim Dave, and we'll

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:44.602
put him up the tree, then we create a BlackBear. Then we have Yogi chase our

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:49.060
victim. We see that Yogi can climb the tree and eat the victim. If we create a

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.720
GrizzlyBear and have the GrizzlyBear try to chase Dave, well, we have not

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.799
defined the chase attribute for the GrizzlyBear. And it doesn't inherit it from

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.593
BlackBear since its base class is Bear, it's not a subclass of BlackBear.
