00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.009
The answer to this question is T, A, T, A, A, A. And the way you want to come up

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:09.793
with that is, we're going to go position by position. Let's

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:13.344
imagine that we're working our way backwards, right, in the

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:17.029
promoter region; minus 30, minus 31, 32, minus 40,

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:19.926
wherever we happen to be at in the sequence. Let's

00:00:19.926 --> 00:00:22.344
take this first position. We have six different samples. Person

00:00:22.344 --> 00:00:24.696
1 has a A here, person 2 has a T,

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:29.484
person 3 has a T, person 4 has a T, person 5 has an A, and person 6

00:00:29.484 --> 00:00:31.494
has a T. There are four T's and two

00:00:31.494 --> 00:00:35.225
A's. The consensus, right, the agreed position is simply

00:00:35.225 --> 00:00:39.960
the majority. The T, the thymine wins out. So

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.551
we have a T here in this position. The

00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:45.631
second position in this sequence A, A, A, T,

00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:49.327
A, A, the dominant position, right, the consensus is

00:00:49.327 --> 00:00:56.246
adenine or A. The next position, T,T,T,A,T,A, again T wins. A,A,A,A,A,A

00:00:56.246 --> 00:01:02.400
wins. A,T,A,A,A,A, A wins again. And T,A,T,A,A,A. A wins again. And

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:11.430
that's how we get the consensus sequence TATAAA or TATAAA.
