the neighborhood's they live in and and
 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.499
the neighborhood's they live in and and
for sure the working class live in much

what's remarkable is this starts very

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900
what's remarkable is this starts very

early we wanted to see how early can we

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900
early we wanted to see how early can we
 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.210
early we wanted to see how early can we
see these two these difference is

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220
see these two these difference is
 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.380
see these two these difference is
developing and we started to see this

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390
developing and we started to see this
 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.880
developing and we started to see this
even as early as three years three years

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890
even as early as three years three years
 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.300
even as early as three years three years
old and the what we did was we brought

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310
old and the what we did was we brought
 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.260
old and the what we did was we brought
three-year-olds into the lab

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270
three-year-olds into the lab
 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.179

working-class and middle-class kids you

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189
working-class and middle-class kids you
 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.460
working-class and middle-class kids you
can't exactly ask them about rules okay

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470
can't exactly ask them about rules okay
 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.109

game and announcing that he's actually
 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.639
game and announcing that he's actually
playing the game correctly and we simply

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649
playing the game correctly and we simply

these differences arise for reason and
 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.310
these differences arise for reason and
they arise early so the rise of Donald

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320
