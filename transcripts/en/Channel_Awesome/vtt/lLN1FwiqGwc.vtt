Hyper Fangirl: Hello!

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.880
Usually, when someone walks in front of a red curtain, it's to tell you that you're about to see something scary.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.380
And indeed, by Internet standards, you will be seeing something scary tonight:

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.420
opinions.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:30.200
[Audience gasping]

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.560
Audience Member: Oh my God!

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.500
Hyper Fangirl: I know, I know. Sometimes, opinions can be scary, especially when they're not your own.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.540
But, remember when Nostalgia Critic reviewed It for the first time and everyone got really angry,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.580
and now, everyone wants him to do a Stephen King review once a year?

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.100
So, being the Internet, we can all be adults here and just agree that there's better things to argue about.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.140
[Audience booing]

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.540
My fiance said that this would happen, so he wrote me a little backup speech.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.820
[Audience continues booing]

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.940
ANY OF YOU CRYBABY SISSPANTS GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT, YOU CAN TAKE IT UP WITH ME!

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.400
HGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHG!

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.960
[Audience screaming]

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.760
HGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHGHG!

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.840
[Audience continues screaming]

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.380
There, that's better.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.940
Enjoy the review, have a good time.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.100
And remember, if anyone feels triggered,

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.940
you can say hello to MY TRIGGER, BEYOTCH!

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
[All screaming]

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.800
???: So I hear your cinematic version is breaking all sorts of box office records.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.460
Y'know, when mine was on TV, the ratings were through the roof.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.040
???: Ratings? What are those?

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.000
???: They were how you measured success before Netflix arrived.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.080
???: Sounds stupid.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.460
???: It kinda was.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.500
They told us nobody watched Family Guy,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.580
but the fans brought it back so that years later,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.340
nobody would watch Family Guy.

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.160
???: Well, what we measure now is box office.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.400
It's only a matter of time before people say I'm the definitive It.

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.940
Tim Curry: WA-HA! I started haunting children's nightmares first!

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.520
Bill Skarsgård: First is worst, as any YouTube commenter would tell ya!

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.560
Curry: They're already looking back and remembering how awesome I was!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.640
I'm tellin' ya, bucko! I almost got It!

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.580
Skarsgård: No! Time will pass and they'll all remember me!

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.300
I almost got It!

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.440
Maurice Moss: I feel like I really shouldn't be here.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.400
You see, where I come from, it's pronounced "I.T. Crowd" as opposed to "IT Crowd".

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.780
Curry: Oh, shut up, Moss, and tell us which It is better!

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:57.280
Moss: A--

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.940
Skarsgård: Yeah, c'mon! I'm scarier!

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:59.440
Moss: You see--

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.620
Curry: But I'm funnier!

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:01.920
Skarsgård: We're not supposed to be funny!

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.680
Curry: WE'RE FRIGGIN' CLOWNS!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.000
Moss: This is going worse than my American pilot.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.400
(whistle)

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.280
???: Hello, boys.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.600
Pour me a cupcake vodka martini, deal me in.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.000
Curry: No.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.040
Skarsgård: We are so not doing that.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.840
Curry: No.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.420
Critic: Oh, c'mon, what's the big deal?

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.500
Skarsgård: You always ruin It for people!

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.120
Curry: Yeah, kids used to be afraid of me,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.060
but now they just come up to me and go "WA-HA! WA-HA! WA-HA!"

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.080
Critic: Oh, c'mon, I like some things in It.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.120
The kids were good, you were good.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.220
Curry: And?

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.240
Critic: I dunno, I blacked out due to the Stephen King Drinking Game™.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.360
Skarsgård: Oh my God, that game comes with a surgeon general's warning, doesn't it?!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.100
Curry: Yeah, y'see, this is what he does!

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.680
He ruins scary things by pointing out their flaws!

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
Like asking why my head turning into a dog was supposed to be scary!

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.500
Critic: Well, why was it supposed to be scary?!

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.380
Did the Pound Puppies take over development?!

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.140
Skarsgård: Forget it! You're not gonna ruin our fun!

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.160
Critic: Okay, look. Both of you are trying to figure out who's the definitive version.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.220
Doesn't it make sense to have ME hear both sides to figure out which one is better?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.660
Have me be the one to determine who almost got It?

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.060
Curry: Not really, no.

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.820
Skarsgård: Awful idea.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.880
Critic: Well, screw you, I'm not talking about The Dark Tower movie.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.420
Curry: That's fair.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.940
Skarsgård: Y'know what?! Go ahead!

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.360
Everybody in the world loves my movie!

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.340
The President of Critics said, "If Jesus was a movie, this would be that movie!"

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:24.480
The United Nations of Film Critics said, "Just stop making movies altogether! Nothing will ever top It!"

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:31.140
And the Holy Church of Heavenly Criticism said, "Take me now, death. I do not fear you.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:37.180
Because I have seen It and I know nothing in life will ever be better!"

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.100
"Going overboard", you may say. "Riding the hype train", perhaps.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.960
I say no.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.020
I challenge you...

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.420
nay, WELCOME you to find one single solitary thing wrong

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.660
with my version of It.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.700
Critic: Okay, this is the cinematic version of It.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.400
Skarsgård: Was kinda hoping you'd be intimidated by that.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:01.900
Critic: I wasn't.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:02.420
Skarsgård: Aw.

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.600
As the credits roll, we see a little boy named Georgie and his stuttering brother named Bill.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.240
Bill: (H-Hey, Georgie.)

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.480
Okay, for the sake of dialogue, we'll switch him out.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.740
Georgie: New White Bill, do you think that the S.S. Georgie is ready to sail?

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.200
New White Bill: Sh-Sh-She sure is.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.860
Georgie: She?

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.500
Bill: Y-You always call a ship a sh-sh-she.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.040
Georgie: Even if it's called the S.S. Georgie?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.500
Bill: You wanna get to the real problems of this film or not?

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.460
Georgie: Yeah, no, okay.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.620
He's excited to test out his paper boat in the rain, but not before he gets what he needs in the creepy basement.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.200
Georgie: Yeah, I'm pretty sure you're not gonna kill me off before the credits end,

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.840
and also, everybody knows that drain sewer scene,

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:45.380
so I'm just gonna assume that those are lightbulbs.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.860
Mr. Lightbulb: Well, ya don't hafta be so mean about it!

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:53.480
Georgie loses his boat in the drain though, coming across the infamous clown, Pennywise.

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:56.820
Pennywise: Hiya, Georgie!

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:57.780
Georgie: NOPE.

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.040
Pennywise: Hey, wait! Where ya goin'?!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.020
Skarsgård: Hey, wait! Where's he goin'?!

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.840
Critic: No kid would be drawn to someone that scary-looking!

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.400
Skarsgård: Yeah, but...they were drawn to him and he's not even scary!

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.240
Curry: Exactly, you dumbass.

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.300
Critic: One of the reasons Pennywise creeped people out so much is he was a legitimately good clown.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:17.080
He was goofy and funny so he could lure kids into his evil traps.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.820
This guy couldn't lure awkward fan art to Tumblr!

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.300
Skarsgård: Hey, I was legitimately creepy! I feed off people's fears!

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.680
Curry: But you don't feed off their dumb!
Something has to draw them in!

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.660
Skarsgård: You want drawing in?! How about THIS?!

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.540
(noises and laughter)

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.300
Georgie: I...gotta go...

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.480
Curry: Oh yeah, that worked great.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.000
Skarsgård: Y'know, we should've just jumped to eating him.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.500
Curry: True.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.920
Critic: Mourning the loss of his brother, Bill, over time, acquires a group of foul-mouthed friends

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.180
known as the Token Troop--

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.140
I mean, Losers Club--

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.840
I mean...

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.160
...let's say Token Club.

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.820
It uses a lot of the traditional "kid group" tropes,

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.440
but to be fair, it was one of the originators of it,
so it's given a little leeway,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.460
like when Token Girl Bev seems to get along with the Token Fat Kid Ben.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.600
Token Girl, Beverly: So you're the new kid on the block.
What are you listening to?

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.540
New Kids on the Block.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:07.660
...really?

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:08.380
Token Fat Kid, Ben: Yeah, really?

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.380
Critic: Okay, it's like the only 80s they cram down your throat.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:12.540
Bev: But it's dumb.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.260
Ben: REALLY dumb.

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.880
Critic: Okay, do you want that or do you want to do
what EVERY movie about the 80s does now and have you wear this?!

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.580
Ben: Okay.
Bev: We'll take the lame joke.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.520
Critic: Good. Now get back to your romantic kinda-maybe-sorta-relationship.

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.380
Bev: I guess I'll be...somewhat attracted to you later?

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.220
Ben: Kinda.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:29.040
Bev: Maybe.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.740
Ben: Sorta.

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.320
Critic: Oddly enough, the other characters are introduced early on through Pennywise scares,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.100
which is strange as we're supposed to be afraid for them even though we don't know them very well yet,

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.120
like Stanley, the Jewish Trope.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.040
Jewish Trope, Stanley: Huh, I wonder why a Jewish temple would have a creepy, abstract painting of a woman.

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.000
I wonder if it was modeled after that woman over there.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.220
(scream)

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.220
Hmmm, I guess I'll tell no one about this.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:02.160
Critic: Yeah, I have no jokes for that moment, that was a legitimately scary scene.

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:09.640
Which is a shame, because some scares are ruined by the film's inability to go all the way with its ideas.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:13.020
For example, a Germaphobe Trope named Eddie is looking for his medication.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.940
A creepy-looking hand grabs it and holds it up to him.

00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.980
Now this is a brilliant setup,
framing the hand in the foreground,

00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:27.480
keeping the creepy person's identity blurred,
building up how scary he's gonna look.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.280
This is MASTERFUL. But then, when it's revealed what he looks like...

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.100
Chester A. Bum: Oooooooo, I have a cold! Oooooooo!

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:38.760
Critic: That payoff isn't scary enough, it's just a really sick-looking guy!

00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.200
He's supposed to be a leper, but c'mon,
you could've gone more creepy than this.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:45.740
To a germaphobe, I guess that's scary, but to us, it's not that bad.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.860
Scares can be lessened in other ways too.

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.320
The Black Kid Trope, named Mike, is quickly shown the
grisly remains of a building that burned down.

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.480
[Intense, scary music starts]

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.240
[Car honks]

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.700
Now this WOULD be incredibly disturbing if the music just shut the hell up.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.520
Most of the soundtrack is hugely over-the-top.

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:32.420
When it's supposed to be pleasant, it crams whimsy into you like Tinker Bell being shoved up your ass.

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.800
(you guys are nice oh so wonderful childhood is great there's nothing wrong with it yay)

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.920
And when it's supposed to be scary, it works in the softer moments,

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:43.220
but there aren't that many softer moments.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:49.140
Instead, it turns what should be goosebumps creeping up your spine into jumpscares being bashed into your skull!

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.040
Look, a scary soundtrack, like any soundtrack, is essential,

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.060
but when it's used too much, it can become like a laugh track,

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:58.420
where it's forcing down your throat what should be coming to you naturally.

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.580
Let's try this scene again except take the music down a lot

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:05.840
and focus more on the eerie silence and a few well-chosen sound effects.

[Subtle, scary music starts]

[Heavy door creaks open]

[Ghostly exhale]

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.560
[Car honks]

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.820
Didn't that seem creepier? Wasn't even the car driving by more jarring?

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.320
Now, don't get me wrong, some scares work brilliantly

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.560
like the burned, headless ghost - his reveal and the way he moves is chillingly unnerving.

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.180
But I'll admit it gets a little silly when you have to show it's still Pennywise.

00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:56.120
Skarsgård: Wait a minute, what do you mean, "silly"?!
There's nothing silly about me!

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:58.800
I'm the most frightening thing in cinema!

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.460
Critic: You wanna tell him or should I?

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.900
Curry: I think we should both tell him.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.120
Skarsgård: What? Tell me what?

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.240
Critic &amp; Curry: YOU'RE A CLOWN!!

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:08.860
Critic: No matter what you do, you're gonna be a little silly!

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.380
Curry: Just embrace it, you oddball of denial!

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.920
Skarsgård: That not true! Remember when I scared Bland Leader Trope--

00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.560
I mean, Billy, by scaring him with his dead brother?

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.960
Pennywise: Hahahaha! Look, I'm Jeff Dunham if he was ever funny! Hahahaha!

00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:23.500
Skarsgård: Now, c'mon, that's scary, isn't it?!

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.100
Critic: Yeah, but...it's still a little funny too.

00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:27.740
Skarsgård: I'm not supposed to be funny!!

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:30.580
I get really scary when I run up to him like this!

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.360
Critic: What is that?

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.180
Skarsgård: It's my thing...my creepy way of running.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:46.220
Curry: You look and sound like a possessed Olaf from Frozen.

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.380
Skarsgård: Go back to haunting Ferngully, this is scary!

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.480
Critic: Oh my God, is there any way we can play the Benny Hill music over that?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.840
Curry: Oh my God, totally do that!

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:54.560
Skarsgård: This is scary!

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.240
[Benny Hill theme starts]

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.600
Curry: Oh, that's...that's- that's gold.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600
Skarsgård: This was never funny until I met you!

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:15.400
Critic: This one kid in the film, I swear, is in his own separate movie, and that's Richie.

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:21.020
I love this kid, mostly because he's like the dorky version of Ash. Think about it!

00:12:21.020 --> 00:12:22.360
He has all the one-liners!

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.620
Richie: They say Derry is a town of beaver traps

00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:27.380
and it still is! Am I right, boys?!

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:28.560
Critic: Except when he doesn't.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:32.360
Richie: Something something something your mom! Am I right, boys?!

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.800
Critic: He's super cowardly!

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.180
Richie: I-I-I-I don't wanna go in there...!

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.300
Critic: Except when he's not!

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:41.300
Richie: You see this? This is my BATSTICK!!

00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:46.980
Critic: He's somehow the geekiest AND coolest kid in the entire movie, the consistent inconsistency!

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.400
But other inconsistencies are more distracting than fun.

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:56.400
Like the adults not noticing the blood that the kid sees
is more unsettling in this one.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.620
Adult: You do something with your hair?

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.040
Hm, I'm gonna do some creepy shit over here.

00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:05.960
Critic: But then the kids are cleaning the blood rocking out to an 80s song.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.140
The...upbeat blood-cleaning scene??

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.780
Why don't you just throw a whisk in there like a chick flick while you're at it?

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:17.060
Curry: WA-HA! See?! You have no idea what you're doing!

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:21.060
Now, OUR version on the other hand, WE made balloons scary!

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:22.100
Critic: No, you didn't.
Curry: Little bit?

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.120
Critic: No "little bit".
Curry: Teeny-tiny?

00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:24.240
Critic: Stop now.
Curry: Yeah, okay.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.500
Critic: The new movie, however, kinda did.

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.340
Curry: WHAT?!

00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:33.720
Critic: For one, all the balloons are red, helping them stand out more and serving as an eerie visual.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:38.660
Dollars to doughnuts for a long time, when someone just sees a single red balloon, they're gonna think of It.

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:43.800
Second, they're used to reveal something.
There's always something creeping behind it.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:49.980
The balloon itself is NOT scary, but rather a build-up to the ACTUAL scare we're about to get.

00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:53.040
Thus, when we see it, we do start to get frightened.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.900
I'll even say the bullies are a lot better!

00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.440
Yeah, the ultimate generic Stephen King trope is actually done fairly well here,

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:05.400
particularly with the main bully, Henry, who's not only given a backstory that's very quick to grasp,

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:10.560
but they also make it clear that his type of bullying is more psychotic than most other bullying.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.800
It isn't just run-of-the-mill, they acknowledge it's pretty messed up.

00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:15.980
Henry: I've been waiting outside the library for you, Ben.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.440
Ben: You waited for hours and knew I'd come this direction?!

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.360
Henry: How dare you point out my cinematic flaws. Just for that...

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.700
Ben: Oh my God, why do you hang out with this guy?

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.440
Side Bully 1: Honestly, we're hiding behind you.

00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.980
Side Bully 2: Yeah, we're afraid he's gonna cut us.

Side Bully 1: Hey, it's working!

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.680
But Ben escapes and comes across the Loser Gang who attends to his wounds.

00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.640
Eddie: Question. Why didn't we take him to a hospital?

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:44.180
Skarsgård: Oh, me! Well, it's because the adults in the area don't care about the kids!

00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:50.560
Critic: Okay, I know that because I read the book, but aside from a couple in a car driving by, it's not made very clear.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.580
Curry: Yeah, and even then, people are still alive. They must have a somewhat functional medical facility!

00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.560
Skarsgård: No time for that! Billy sees Bev walking for the first time in slow-mo!

[Enchanting, romantic theme starts]

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.180
Critic: Wait, didn't he just see her a moment ago in the drugstore?

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.100
Skarsgård: ...but not in slow-mo.

00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.440
Critic: But isn't that USUALLY reserved for the first time you see someone?

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:24.300
Like the first time you see her, things slow down? Why do it the following moment?

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.220
Is it..."love at second sight"...?

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:28.900
Skarsgård: What? You don't know.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:31.240
Curry: ...you're right, we don't!

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:33.660
Skarsgård: Well, if you don't know, I'm not gonna tell you!

00:15:35.660 --> 00:15:36.760
Critic: ...who just won that?

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.760
Critic: So Ben invites the Losers Club over as a means to say thanks for saving him.

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.060
Ben: Yeah, I study disappearances and histories of towns that I just moved to.

00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:11.280
Eddie: Wow, your incredibly distinct quirk is very convenient for us...

00:16:11.540 --> 00:16:15.040
Critic: Eh, I guess I'll give the movie this; instead of the Fat Kid Trope being obsessed with

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.140
Ben: (Food!)

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:17.720
Critic: In this, he's obsessed with

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.780
Ben: (Town!)

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.360
Critic: It's a little forced, but not as forced as this.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.020
Bev: Oh my God, you still like New Kids on the Block??

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.540
Ben: Yes, as I clearly established earlier.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.340
Bev: Wow, that is still SO 80s!

00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:38.280
Richie: Hey, does anyone notice this incredibly obvious picture of a clown with our city's founders?

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.760
Eddie: I mean, we have to pause the movie to focus on that poster!

00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.140
Ben: While playing a song too.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.160
Richie: I mean, it's right here for everyone to see, I just thought someone would notice it.

00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.600
Eddie: Yeah, this film's mostly timeless, but sometimes we gotta kick you in the balls with 80s!

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:54.160
Ben: Yeah, what'd we get, only five close-ups of the poster?

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:59.760
Richie: And we only got two of the creepy clown here. Like, someone else notice it. Someone else NOTICE it.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.280
Ben: Did I mention Batman and Lethal Weapon are playing at the theater?

00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.420
Bev: Wow, the 80s are so cool!

00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.240

Critic: The tone gets even weirder when Mike appears back in the movie.

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.340
Yeah, he kinda disappeared for a long time, didn't he?

00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.720

[Heavy metal continues]

00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:02.320
Critic: So they save Mike and decide to allow him to be in the Losers Club.

00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:07.400
Bev: Do you believe in UFOs, astral projections, mental telepathy, ESP, clairvoyance,

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:13.140
spirit photography, telekinetic movement, full transmediums, the Loch Ness Monster, and the theory of Atlantis?

00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:16.600
Mike: As long as I'm not marginalized like that Jewish kid, I'll believe anything you say.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.400
Bev: What Jewish kid?

(various forms of "No", "Not at all", and "Kinda sorta")

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.360
Stanley: It's okay, it's okay...

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.080
There are so many characters in this movie anyway, somebody was bound to get less screen time.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.500
Heck, I'm not even here half the time, I'm a cardboard cutout.

00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.100
Ben: Huh, I did not know that.

00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:38.760

Mike: You got it! Where do you want me?

Richie: In the back with the Jewish kid.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:42.660
Mike: Oh.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.260
Critic: The film does get genuinely fun again and not forced fun like:

Side Bully 2: Yyyyoooouuuuu bbbbbiiiiiiiiiiiiii--

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:50.660
Critic: ...whatever that was.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:55.840
After a scene where Pennywise comes to life on their slide projector, the kids enter a haunted house that,

00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:00.680
honestly, is kind of like a neighborhood Halloween haunted house, and I mean that in the best way.

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:06.860
It has rooms with creepy toys, cobwebs, doors that lead to over-the-top scares. It's goofy, gory fun.

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:08.560
Skarsgård: STOP SAYING THAT!!

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.100
Critic: Saying what?

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.920
Skarsgård: Things like "goofy, gory fun"! Does this sound like a voice that'd be interested in "goofy, gory fun"?!

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.860
I am super scary and super serious in this gritty re-imagining of It!

00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.520
I contort my body and turn into all sorts of sharp things!

00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.580
Critic: Oh, you mean with your crappy digital effects?

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:26.860
Moss: Oh, that's just typical of you critics, isn't it?

00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.080
Curry: I totally forgot he was still there.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.740
Critic: Yeah, weren't you just an opening punchline?

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.260
Moss: I know how this works.

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.780
When you point out bad digital effects, that means you hate ALL digital effects!

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.500
Critic: That's not what I said at all, bu--

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.060
Moss: I get it. You hate Pixar, you despise Jurassic Park,

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.760
you want to see Officer Hopps die!

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.840
Critic: Okay, look, digital effects are wonderful and have come a long way, especially in horror films.

00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.620
CGI can make a ghostly image seem there and NOT there at the same time.

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:59.000
It's one of the few examples where the uncanny valley actually HELPS an effect.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.200
And half the time, it's great in this film.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:06.640
The creepy painting coming to life, the headless boy;
a good half of the digital effects are very effective!

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:10.660
Moss: Great! That means you love all CGI! I'm glad we cleared this up.

00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:14.000
Critic: No, here's the thing; like any effects, there's good and bad ones,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.700
and when you use then so often in your movie, the bad ones are gonna be easier to spot!

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.320
The fear of Pennywise isn't that he's a ghost you can see through, he's supposed to look like he's really there,

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:31.300
and if your digital effects don't have time to really make it look like his hand is turning into a werewolf or he's transforming into a monster,

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:36.340
because you have to use that time on other digital effects, the fear is massively diluted.

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.760
Moss: Nope! It was all amazing and you hate everything digital!

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.400
Like that blurry run effect. How did you do that?

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:43.820
Skarsgård: Oh, of course!

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.960
Moss: You're just filming your face really close to the phone.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.380
Skarsgård: It costs CGI artists thousands to recreate this!

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:56.980
Moss: Are we still playing?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.320
Critic: The kids fight back Pennywise, showing they can defeat him,

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.380
so of course let's have THIS be the moment where they split up and go their separate ways.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.040
Bill: S-So long, everyone. It's time we split up and go our separate ways.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.360
Critic: [Heavy sarcasm] Oh, yeah, you really got me there, movie.

00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:12.920
I'm SO sure they're never gonna meet up again.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.180
Bill: No no! I-I-I-It's really sad!

00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:18.080

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.300
Bev: Wait, why ARE we leaving? We've got him on the run, we should finish him off!

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.400
Analyst Two: Nope, nope! This is the part where you PUSS. OUT.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.860
Curry: But that cliche is in everything. I know, I was in those cliches when they became popular!

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:34.500
Analyst One: Nononononononononononononononono, no no, nono!

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:39.100
We're not going to fix old cliches. Instead, we're going to put a whole bunch of other ones in!

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:40.200
Bev: Like what?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:42.800
Analyst Two: Well, the damsel-in-distress for one.

00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:46.620

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.700
Huh. Well, wanna go to a chart bar, maybe talk some math?

Eddie: She's down there.

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.480
Bill: Wait, w-w-what's that on your arm?

00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:04.860
Eddie: It's a cast.

Ben: You went to a hospital?!
Richie: I thought I knew you!

00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:09.360

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:11.740
Bill: Quick! M-M-M-Mike!!

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.940
Eddie: Damn it, Mike! We kind of need you to kind of justify your kind of arc!

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:18.160
Mike: Oh. Okay.

Stanley: Wonderful! Now I can tell you all about my incredibly interesting backstory!

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.200
Eddie: Uh...we're actually- we're kinda past the two-hour mark...

00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.200
Ben: We can probably get you a bonus feature on the Blu-ray.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.420
Stanley: Fair enough!

00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:38.380
Richie: Really...a hospital?

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.120
I bet the nurses were hot though!

Eddie: (scream) I thought it was a placebo!

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.920
Critic: Meanwhile, Beverly wakes up in the sewers where--

00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.380
Oh, Christ.

[Synth music starts]

00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:04.900
Skarsgård: Oh, now what?!

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:07.580
Curry: You sure you're not supposed to be at all funny?

00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.480
Skarsgård: What? It's a scary dance of evil! It's poopy trousers time!

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.480
Critic: Yeah, especially when you play this over it.

(laughter)

00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:25.500
Skarsgård: Oh, c'mon, people just stopped playing Gangnam Style over that!

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:30.340
Oh, yeah?! Well, here's something in MY version of the movie that YOUR version never had:

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.840
people actually FLOATING!

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.820
Critic: Oh my God, really?

00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:33.900
Skarsgård: Uh-YUH!

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.820
Critic: Yeah, that's a really good point! For all the times you always said "they float, they always float"

00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:44.360
we never do see anybody float in your version!

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:47.100
Curry: WA-HA! WA-HA!

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.200

Curry: Yes, it is.

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.220
WA-HA! WA-HA! WA-HA! WA-HA! WA-HA!

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.580

Bill: Well, I guess we did it.
Bev: We sure did.

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.540

Also, I JUST did a kissing scene with him.

Bill: I-I don't follow this, it's the last scene of the movie

00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:09.460

00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:40.860
Skarsgård: And that is the greatest thing we ever made as humans.

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.880
Cinematically flawless, hauntingly haunting,

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:48.280
the most amazing horror film ever made good super yes...good.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.940
Curry: Don't think you're overhyping it just a teeny bit?

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:54.400
Skarsgård: Nope, it's perfect. And anyone who thinks different hates movies!

00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:55.480
Critic: Well--

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.600
Skarsgård: Yes, movie hater?

00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.140
Critic: It's hard to say this is a "flawless" horror film,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.340
but, at the same time, it's hard to say it's bad, too.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.240
There's a lot of scares, fun ideas, decent enough characters,

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.860
and, in many respects, it is better than the original.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:13.640
On the whole, I do recommend it as a scary flick.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.880
Skarsgård: Hahahaha, take that, Ronald Horror Picture Show!

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:21.540
Critic: BUT there is one thing the original has that the new one doesn't.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.100
Skarsgård: What's that?

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.320
Curry: Personality.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.440
Critic: The original was silly and awkward, but it kind of relished it.

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:34.000
From the awkward effects, to the hokey acting, to the odd writing,

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.300
and, of course, Tim Curry giving a million percent.

00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:41.100
It's not scary, but it's an over-the-top, campy TV movie.

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:44.420
This is trying to be an 80s film, a timeless film,

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.540
have subtle scares, over-the-top scares,

00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.600
adult humor, cartoony humor;

00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.820
tonally and stylistically, it's just all over the place.

00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:57.360
I admire it for trying so much, but they don't always fit together, which helps create less of an identity.

00:26:57.700 --> 00:27:03.720
So, even though the cinematic version is better, I'll strangely enough probably remember the original more.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:09.380
So yes, It is good enough. I just don't think it's the game-changer everybody builds it up to be.

00:27:09.660 --> 00:27:13.600
Curry: But wait, you never answered the question! Which of us is the definitive It?

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.060
Skarsgård: Yeah, scary or funny? Which is It?

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:20.220

Skarsgård: They're not Jared Leto?

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.740
Joker: Yes.

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.700

Hello, Doug Walker here doing the charity shoutout and this week,

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:30.500
we are doing the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:36.960
This foundation is dedicated to saving lives and bringing hope to those affected by suicide.

00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.700
They create a culture that's smart about mental health through education and community programs,

00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:45.320
develop suicide preventions through research and advocacy,

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:48.880
and provide support for those affected by suicide.

00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:55.360
With headquarters in New York, they have 80 local chapters with programs and events nationwide.

00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:02.320
They work hard to raise awareness, fund scientific research, and provide resources and aid to those affected.

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.780
If you go to their site or their YouTube channel, you can see all the people who have been helped in the past,

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:11.860
