00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.560
Let's say that today-- and
we'll call today Day 1--

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.000
Day 1 is a Monday.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.830
What I want to
figure out is what

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.600
is the Day 300 going to be?

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.857
What day of the week
will Day 300 be?

00:00:15.857 --> 00:00:17.440
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.800
and think about
that a little bit.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.100
So let's just write out
the days of the week.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.090
You have Monday-- I'll do this
in a different color-- you have

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:37.140
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.226
and Sunday.

00:00:39.226 --> 00:00:40.600
So if we had a
lower number here,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.230
we could just fill this out.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.380
Monday is Day 1.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.490
Tuesday's Day 2.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.450
Wednesday, Day 3.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.794
4, 5, 6, 7.

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:49.460
I'll keep going.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.030
Day 8, well, that's going
to be a Monday again.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.190
9 10.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.920
I'm almost writing
a calendar out.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.270
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.510
So this is kind of useful.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.051
I could just write
it out if I wanted

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:06.520
to figure out something
Day 16 or Day 20.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.220
I could just write that out.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.806
But this isn't that helpful if
I want to figure out Day 300

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:12.180
or especially
wouldn't be helpful

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.920
if I wanted to
figure out Day 3,000.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.360
So can I come up with
some mathematical way

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.750
of thinking about what
Day 300 is going to be?

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.130
Well, as you see when I
started drawing this grid here,

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.540
this grid has rows.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.895
And each row, you
have seven days in it.

00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:28.770
And that makes sense.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.307
There are seven
days of the week.

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:33.390
So is there a way that if
someone just gave you 16

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.960
without drawing
this grid, then you

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.060
would know that 16 is a Tuesday?

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.800
Well, one way to think about
it that might jump out at you

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.180
is you could divide 16 by 7.

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.680
That will tell you how many of
these rows will come before 16.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.110
So 16 divided by 7 is 2.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.440
You have 2 rows before
16 right over here.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.340
You could get 7 into 16 2 times.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.720
And then you have a remainder.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.020
What is the remainder
when you divide 16 by 7?

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.690
16 divided by 7
is going to be 2.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.400
2 times 7 is 14.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610
You're going to have
a remainder of 2.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.870
So when we divide,
we've historically

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.230
cared more about this 2.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.010
We normally care
more about well,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.430
how many times
does it go into it.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.590
But now, the remainder
is actually interesting.

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.050
The remainder is really
interesting here.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.810
Because the remainder
tells you-- the first two

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:35.200
just tells you 7
goes into 16 2 times.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.020
That's how many rows you have
before getting to the 16.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.410
But then the remainder tells
you in that row where is the 16?

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.630
So the 16 is remainder 2.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.250
So the 16 is not the first.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.940
It's the second entry
in the third row.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.300
And so it's going
to be a Tuesday.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.257
Tuesday is the second day.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:55.340
I know what you're saying.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.430
Does that always work?

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.090
Well, let's try it out
with some other examples.

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.490
Let's imagine Day 25.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.240
So let's just divide 25 by 7.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.330
So I'll do it right
over-- I could do it.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.140
I'm going to make sure
I have enough space.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.940
So if I have 7 goes into
25, it goes 3 times.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.770
3 times 7 is 21.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.080
You have a remainder of 4.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.340
So let's see.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.240
So based on that-- so let
me rewrite this-- so 25

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.785
divided by 7 is equal
to 3, remainder 4.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.340
So based on this, if we
were to write out the grid,

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.740
we should have three rows of
7 before we get to the 25.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.680
And then 25 should sit
in the fourth column.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.310
So if it's sitting
in the fourth column,

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:47.920
it should be a Thursday.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.120
So Day 25, based on this
little math we just did,

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.300
should be a Thursday.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.810
Let's see if that
actually works out.

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:06.086
So let's go to 17, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24 and 25.

00:04:06.086 --> 00:04:08.390
It is indeed a Thursday.

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:09.970
But it makes complete sense.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.390
You could get seven rows in it
before the row that gets to 25.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.180
And then in that row, it's
going to be the fourth entry,

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.940
because you have
a remainder of 4.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.360
1, 2, 3, 4.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.900
It's going to be a Thursday.

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.950
So now we're ready to
answer the question.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.570
What is Day 300 going to be?

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:34.560
So let's just divide 300
by 7 and see where we get.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.510
7 goes into 30 4 times.

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.900
4 times 7 is 28.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.240
Subtract, you get 2.

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760
Bring down a 0.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.530
7 goes into 20 2 times.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:49.450
2 times 7 is 14.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.730
And then we get our remainder.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.860
And now we care much
more about the remainder.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.970
20 minus 14 is 6.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.870
So our remainder is 6.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.080
So if we think about what day
of the week it is, in its row

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.684
it's going to be
the sixth entry.

00:05:04.684 --> 00:05:06.100
It's going to be
the sixth column.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.290
There's going to be
42 rows above it.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.180
But we care about which
entry it is in its row.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.510
So Day 300 is going to be
the sixth day of the week,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.810
the way we've written it out.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.398
It is going to be a Saturday.
