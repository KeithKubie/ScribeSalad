00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.870
It's a beautiful spring day here in San Francisco.

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.430
Perfect time to talk about suicide, really.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.959
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:15.369
Did you know that suicides peak in the spring?

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.200
It's a stable trend that has been tracked
since the 1820s and in dozens of countries

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.240
around the world.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.570
The most suicidal month is May, when suicides
spike by up to 50%.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.300
I would have guessed it would be a winter
month but...nope, the winter months actually

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880
have the LOWEST suicide rates.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.550
As for those affected, suicide is most common
amongst those over 65, but for the 15-24 age

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.480
group, suicide is the 3rd leading cause of
death.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.000
While women are more likely to have suicidal
*thoughts*, men are most likely to *complete*

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.450
a suicide and make up about 80% of cases.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.611
This is attributed to the fact that men are
more likely to use unforgivable means: like

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:52.190
firearms, whereas women are more likely to
overdose or poison themselves.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.660
There are a lot of big questions to untangle
the suicide web in order to effectively prevent

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.520
them, and one of them is: why spring?

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.680
Why suicides around the world peak in the
spring is actually one of the most studied

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.280
questions in psychiatry.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.450
Which makes it even stranger that scientists
still don't have any hard answers.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.692
One of the original theories when this was
first discovered in the 1800s that the spring

00:01:11.692 --> 00:01:16.380
brings more sun, and with the sun more feel-good
neurotransmitters like serotonin provide us

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.380
with more energy.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.270
But in a depression sufferer, that energy
manifests not with more socializing and time

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.740
outdoors -- but as inward aggression and self
harm.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.800
Spring's sun may provide a boost of energy
required to successfully execute a suicide

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.800
plan.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.119
While this is an ollllld theory, it's one
that's still around and highly regarded by

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.119
scientists.

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.190
In fact, the serotonin bit was a more recent
development.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.640
Another leading theory comes down to the relationship
between suicide and inflammation.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.830
What we've already known for awhile is that
there is a strong link between depression

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.340
and inflammation -- inflammatory diseases
heighten depression risk more so than other

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.340
diseases do.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.180
There are a couple reasons why inflammation
might be higher in the spring -- people tend

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.240
to get sick more in the winter (which I did
another DNews on why if you're interested)

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.780
and there may be residual inflammation from
those late winter infections.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.820
Another reason is, of course, allergies!

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.310
Allergies drive an inflammatory response.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.509
A study at the University of Maryland has
actually found a positive link between high

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.980
tree pollen counts with high seasonal suicide
rates.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.030
It's also been found that those who work in
agriculture have even more exaggerated suicide

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.030
rates in the spring.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.290
It may very well be in the trees, peeps.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.590
I seem to recall an M. Night Shamalan movie
about something like that?

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.400
I think it was called "The Happening".

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.010
.....Kind of weird.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.030
Maybe he was onto something.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.709
Thanks for joining me for DNews everyone,
stay safe and healthy.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:35.760
I've dropped some stuff down below in the
description for anyone out there who may be

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.900
having a tough time themselves this spring.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.130
Nobody should have to go it alone, and sometimes
reaching out for help is the bravest thing

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.070
you can do to take care of yourself.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.430
I'll see you folks next time.
