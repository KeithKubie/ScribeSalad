00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.974
Let's start by defining 
a database contract

00:00:02.974 --> 00:00:05.039
between our data and our model.

00:00:05.637 --> 00:00:09.057
A contract is an agreement 
between our data model and our view

00:00:09.057 --> 00:00:11.673
describing how information is stored.

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.374
It will contain all the fields 
that our user interface will display.

00:00:15.374 --> 00:00:18.784
Let's go into Android Studio 
to begin coding.

00:00:18.843 --> 00:00:22.751
We'll add a new package 
to our project named data

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.353
to encapsulate the data model.

00:00:26.647 --> 00:00:30.700
Next, we'll create a contract class 
to store our column information.

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.831
The inner classes within 
our contract class

00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:38.415
will be used to define tables.

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:42.818
Each table will implement base columns
because the columns represented

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:44.678
by base columns are useful.

00:00:44.741 --> 00:00:49.131
The ID column, in particular, 
must be part of our table in order

00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:52.745
for our content provider integration
to work later on in this lesson.
