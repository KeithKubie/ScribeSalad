00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.130
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Free, the future of a radical
price. First, it is a bizarre experience talking

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:16.139
about Free here at Google which I think of
in many way as the citadel of Free accompany

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.520
that is, in many ways, if I can mix metaphors
horribly, you know, a poster child for making

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.070
money around Free, or something that many
people find paradoxical and impossible. I

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.330
should also say that Howell has taught me
everything I know about Free and that was

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.390
only a tiny fraction of what he knows about
Free. And I should also say that my attempt

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:41.750
to sort of formalize and put Free in the historical
and economic context is simply looking in

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.329
the rear view mirror at what the engineers
here and in other companies had internalized,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.310
had sort of intuitively understood about the
dynamics and economics of digital networks.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.690
And it is--it goes, too, without saying. A
lot of things that feels so wrong and counterintuitive

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.140
and mysterious to people in my industry and
people in traditional industries are not only

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.380
self-evident to engineers and to people who
live in the digital world, but also self-evident

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:17.130
to my children who grew up in the digital
world. So, this--the paradox of my life is

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.420
that, you know, my book about what's different
about digital economics and why Free goes

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.709
from a gimmick to a business model is seen
as incredibly obvious and, you know, self-evident

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.619
to my children. They say, "You're kidding,
dad. You wrote a book about how things online

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:43.369
could be Free." And incredibly impossible
and counterintuitive to people of my generation,

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.532
they're like, "Don't you know, there's no
such thing as a free lunch?" Somewhere between

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:52.899
"the" and "no way" struck me as the right
subject for a book. I'm going to sort of plow

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.979
through about 30 minutes of just an overview
and I'd really want to turn to the Q and A

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.729
which I think will be more fun. But the history
of Free... So, I would argue that Free is

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.969
the most misunderstood--one of the most misunderstood
words in the English language. It is a word

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:13.570
that is semantically complicated, it has two
meanings. It is a word that is changed in

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:21.849
meaning over time. It is a word that is--that
we fear and yet longed for. It is a word that

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:31.920
fills us full of, you know, psychological
trauma and attraction. We field tricks by

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.310
it and yet we fall for it every time. Free
started as a--in the marketing context, in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.160
the late 1800s. You probably thought of King
Gillette and the razor and blades as being

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.219
the first user of Free as a business model.
You give away the razor, you sell the blades.

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:54.590
It actually was pre-dated by three or four
years by this guy, Frank Woodward, who...

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.930
At the beginning of the--at the end of 1800s,
this is the beginning of the packaged-goods

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.140
food industry. Before then, food was largely
produce and meat and sold in green grocers

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.530
and local merchants. And you would have--it
would have been as a fresh produce and you're

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:16.060
just beginning to see the first foods in boxes,
and these first foods in boxes were almost

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.709
entirely powders. There were yeasts, baking
soda, some sugars, and things like that. Now,

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:26.120
in those days you didn't have shells, didn't
have isles as you walk through. Everything

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.719
was behind the counter of the merchant himself
and you had to ask for it by name. And so,

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:38.720
the origins of branding and the origins of
advertising coexisted with the origins of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.140
packaged foods. Food without a brand was hard
to ask for. You need to say, "I want, you

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.769
know, that one, the red one," and, you know,
the easier you could put a name to it, the

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.599
easier it was for people to call that from
across the counter. The problem... This guy,

00:03:52.599 --> 00:04:00.360
Frank Woodward, had bought a recipe for powdered
gelatin, it was called Jell-O. Now, gelatin

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:07.769
had two problems. One problem was that it
was an unfamiliar commodity. Before this time,

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.890
gelatin was something you made yourself. You
boiled cow's [INDISTINCT] or fish bones for,

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.859
like, an afternoon, and it was smelling horrible
and disgusting. And you did that to extract

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.970
the gelatin. However, they'd figured out how
to do is to take gelatin and to create a sheet

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.510
of it and then powder and then grind that
sheet up into a powder. But then the notion...

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.000
And then you would reconstitute it with water.
But the standard American home in those days

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.140
didn't use gelatin either as a dessert or
a salad topping, and so it was unfamiliar

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.110
concept; you know, you could use gelatin in
any meal. Then there was the effect of the

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.690
branding, Jell-O, which was also unfamiliar.
So, they had a--they had a demand-generation

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.860
problem. They also had--because it was a part
of a larger food company, Genesee Pure Food,

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.630
is they had this fleet of trucks. Now, this
fleet of trucks was largely to serve the local

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.180
merchants to deliver boxes of foodstuffs.
But they thought, "Well, maybe what we'll

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.200
do is we'll just go door-to-door and we'll
sell--we would explain to people what this

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:09.640
gelatin thing is door-to-door." The problem
at that time was that there was a--to sell-door-to

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:15.331
door in late 1800s, you need a license. That
license cost money and took time. They didn't

00:05:15.331 --> 00:05:18.820
have the time or the money, so they're like,
"Okay, there must be a loophole," and there

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.180
was. The loophole was that you could--you
need license to sell door-to-door but you

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.490
need no license to give away things door-to-door.
This was allowed--this was so that a few could

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.870
give out religious pamphlets. No doubt, they
came out on some free religion rules. So,

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.330
what they said is, "Okay, so there is the
trick, we need to give something away. What

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:44.840
should we give away?" And so, what they eventually
came up with was this; a recipe book. They

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.940
invented this beautiful book of how to cooking
with Jell-O, and some of the greatest illustrators

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:58.510
of the day, including Norman Rockwell and
others, created this, you know, this pamphlet,

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.540
initially, and then a book that was sold or
was given away by the millions. So what they

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.520
would is that they go door-to--door, hand
out this book. Now, the book is useless without

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.870
the ingredients; a recipe book needs ingredients.
They would go then to the merchants, and they

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.440
will say, "You're about to have a flood of
people coming in here asking for this new

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.071
product, Jell-O, and you should stock it.
And here in the back of our truck we have

00:06:18.071 --> 00:06:23.140
lots of boxes of Jell-O." So what they did
is they created demand by giving away a product

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:28.610
that was useless by itself and then satisfied
that demand by selling it to the merchants

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.360
which required no license. And there--and
that was the beginning--King Gilette did the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.390
same thing with razors and blades, although
it's a complete urban myth, by the way, that

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:41.610
King Gillette ever gave away razors. He didn't.
What he did is he sold razors as a discount

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:47.640
to banks and then the banks gave them away
as part of a save-and-shave campaign; very

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.900
clever. Once again, the razor is useless without
the blade and so, ultimately, you know, you

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:57.080
got one thing for free but you bought another.
Now, this is... This is the model and today

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:00.770
we have--you get your cell phone for free,
especially if you work at Google, and you

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.180
pay for the minutes. This is form of free
is not a new economic model. This form of

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:12.211
free is a trick. It is called a cross subsidy
and the reason it's a trick is that it's not

00:07:12.211 --> 00:07:15.580
really free, you're paying. You're paying
sooner or later. You're not paying now; you're

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:21.150
paying over time; you create it by giving
away one thing for free; you created an annuity

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.150
and a way monetize someone over time. We in
the--you know, we see this in many places.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:30.940
"Buy one get one free" is not free, "Free
gift inside" is not free, you know, even loss

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:36.210
laid in stores are pretty quickly paid back.
So that's 20th century free. 20th century

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.220
free is not really free because the underline
cost of the products are not on zero and so

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:50.680
you need to pay them back pretty quickly or
else you go bankrupt. That is... That defined

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:59.930
free in the 20th century. Now, what we've
seen in the 21st century is a different economy.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:08.460
This is the economy not of Adams or razors
but of this, the virtual swords. The difference

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:12.460
between economy of Adams and the economy of
bits is something that, you know, again, you've

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:19.891
internalized. But it was formalized by the
likes of George Gilder, Michael Carlson, by

00:08:19.891 --> 00:08:29.030
Kevin Kelly, and "New Rules to a New Economy",
Nicholas Negroponte in "Being Digital, and,

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:32.810
in a sense, Stewart Brand in his original
phrase, "Information wants to be free." All

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:36.610
of them understood that there was something
different about information economies and

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:41.800
bits economies. And the basic difference is
this, Adams economies are inflationary; they're

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.900
based on scarce resources, be they raw materials,
land, labor, et cetera; they tend to get more

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.430
expensive over time. Free can only be a trick
in atoms economies because the marginal cost

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:56.620
production and distribution are nonzero. Bits
economies are deflationary; they get cheaper

00:08:56.620 --> 00:09:01.460
over time. We knew this from--going back to
Moore's Law, but what happened with the Internet

00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.421
is we took Moore's Law's deflationary force,
which is 50 percent every 18 months, and we

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:12.430
added to it the deflationary forces of storage,
which is 50 percent every 14 months, and bandwidth,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:17.340
which is 50 percent every 12 months. And this
triple play of deflationary forces, processing,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:23.110
storage, and bandwidth, created, you know,
an economy where the underlying--the marginal

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:28.810
cost of reproduction and distribution are
falling by about 50 percent a year. So, whatever

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:33.740
it cost you guys to stream a video on YouTube
today it will cost half as much as that a

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:40.440
year from now and so on. This is... Now we've
had moments in history where industrial economies

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:47.010
had deflationary episodes. When we went from
muscle power to steam power, we had a deflationary...

00:09:47.010 --> 00:09:51.230
It was cheaper to do something; steam was
cheaper than muscle. But then again, you've

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:56.000
got inflationary again when we went from steam
to electricity. Suddenly, deflationary--you

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:02.901
know, step function and then it got inflationary
again. Bits have been going 50 years and they

00:10:02.901 --> 00:10:06.051
appear that they're going to be going for
many more years. These are based on, you know,

00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:09.230
you understand the underlying physics of why
this is. And what's interesting about these

00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:13.900
three forces is that each one is based on
different physical properties; in the semiconductor;

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:20.710
quantum properties for the processing; plutonic
process is for bandwidth; and mechanical processes

00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:25.270
of magnetic density for storage. But each--but
in all cases, we've got a long way still to

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:30.710
run. So it looks like this is the first deflationary
economy that's going to run decade after decade,

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:40.270
and that is unique. And what that means is
that zero becomes an inevitability. Hall was

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:44.600
the first person to sort of, you know, put
this in economic context for me, and he described

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:51.660
it at the time as a sort of a battle of two
French economists, Cournot and Bertrand, and

00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.410
now I'm going to do violence to the subtleties
on this one. But, basically, in the mid 1800s,

00:10:56.410 --> 00:11:02.380
at the beginning of economics, we were wrestling
with some very basic things; and one of those

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.830
things is, "Where does price come from? What
sets price?" And, you know--I mean, Adam Smith

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:12.880
wrestled for years on the concept of, "Is
price based on some intrinsic quality or character

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:16.060
of the products?" And eventually, of course,
we came up with prices what the market will

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:19.960
bear, prices what people will pay. But there
was a lot wrestling about these basics. And

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:24.600
one of the problems--one of the things we
were trying to figure out was, "What about

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.070
competition? What does competition do with
the price?" Now, you would not think that

00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:32.330
competition was a new concept, but it was.
And the reason was, is that we were just starting

00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:38.670
to have similar goods. Before the industrial
age, all goods were unique and you didn't

00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:42.810
have head-to-head competition. With the beginning
of the Industrial Age, you saw this a lot

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:48.270
in England with things like silverware and
plates in China and cutlery and things like

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:52.670
that; we started to have similar products.
Not only are the products mass-produced so

00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.790
they were all the same within the same factory,
but the different factories would have products

00:11:55.790 --> 00:12:01.510
of similar quality. Now, again, before the,
you know, even in those days when you were

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.750
starting to see similar products, you still
didn't have marketplaces where the two were

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:08.940
head-to-head. But they could imagine that
someday you will have a world where you would

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:15.290
have true competition. The question is what
would happen to price? Cournot argued that

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:21.620
the manufacturers would conspire. They would
conspire to keep capacity off the marketplace

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:29.029
to prep price up. You know, if the demand
for teacups is 10,000 a week, you don't want

00:12:29.029 --> 00:12:32.670
to make 20,000 a week 'cause that will press
the price down. So what would happen is that

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:36.120
they were--there would be some sort of signaling
between the manufacturers to keep capacity

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:43.080
off the market and they would have a cartel,
a behavior. Bertrand, a few years later, looked

00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.690
to that and argued just the opposite. He started
that rather than compete on capacity, they

00:12:46.690 --> 00:12:51.050
would compete on price. And what would happen
is that they would not take the broader good

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.200
of the marketplace into consideration. They
would instead use their own good, the good

00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:00.850
of their own company, and it would be preeminent,
and they would undercut their competitors

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:07.120
until--to gain market share, until they hit
the marginal cost of production. So that if

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:12.460
it cost $10 to make a plate that they would
compete their way down 'til the price was

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:17.610
$10.10, or whatever. And it broadly that--in
a competitive market price would fall to the

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:23.370
marginal cost. And this was considered a completely
theoretical debate for about a hundred years

00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:29.240
until we created two things. Well, on the
Internet, we created, first, the most competitive

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:35.230
market the world has ever seen, the barriers
to entry are zero; the ability to replicate

00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:40.210
a new product is infinite; and we also created
the marketplace where the marginal cost of

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:45.301
production and distribution is close to zero.
And so what these totally theoretical economic

00:13:45.301 --> 00:13:52.511
speculations from late 1800s did is essentially
define the law of gravity online. And what

00:13:52.511 --> 00:13:58.351
that says is that zero becomes an inevitability
of--you know, because zero--the marginal cost

00:13:58.351 --> 00:14:01.850
of production is close to zero, then the price
will go close to zero. And as a matter of

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:06.470
fact, people will tend to round down to zero
itself because the psychological benefits

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:10.220
of zero as opposed to any other price are
so great. And if you don't make your product

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:14.339
free, someone else will. Now, the products
aren't exactly identical but they're often

00:14:14.339 --> 00:14:19.330
close enough that free tends to win. And so,
what this created was a situation where free

00:14:19.330 --> 00:14:27.779
becomes not so much a choice-- not so much
an option but inevitability in the marketplace.

00:14:27.779 --> 00:14:32.660
You know, the products--your product--for
any given class of products, free will be

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:37.600
out there. It is one of the prices. You either
make it your price and compete on something

00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.710
else, making money out of something else,
or you find a way to compete with free by

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:47.810
selling something that adds additional value.
And the reality is we do both. The first pass

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:52.940
of the Internet was to apply the 20th century
form of near-zero marginal cost free which

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:57.580
was the media business. Radio is free to air;
televisions are free to air; the marginal

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.580
cost of reaching the nth viewer was close
to zero. And so what we did is we max--we

00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:07.190
used the sort of, you know, the new economy
at that time which was the amazing ability

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:11.441
of broadcast to reach additional people with
no additional cost and use that to create

00:15:11.441 --> 00:15:16.880
mass audiences. Then we monetized those mass
audiences by selling attention, audience attention,

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:21.920
to advertisers, and economists call that a
two-sided market. One side is free, producer

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:27.280
to consumer, and the other side is paid, advertiser
to producer. And that is--in the first wave

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.959
of the Internet, that's what we did. We used
the marginal cost economics of the Internet

00:15:31.959 --> 00:15:35.560
to create mass audiences and we slapped ads
against them, ads against them, those very

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:40.270
same display ads that we were using in print
and we created a two-sided market. Then the

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:44.800
second way of the Internet was Google and
you did the same thing, but you created a

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.140
new form of advertising that was [INDISTINCT]
matched to the granular nature of the Internet

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:53.660
itself. It didn't require mass audiences,
it works as well for mass, for the generalist,

00:15:53.660 --> 00:16:00.209
for the specific, for the mass and the niche.
What is also great about it is that, of course,

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:05.709
the Internet was agnostic as to the nature
of the biz moving over it, unlike broadcast

00:16:05.709 --> 00:16:11.040
which is really one to many and designed to
entertaining once it [INDISTINCT], the Internet

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:17.230
is scale-agnostic and so it could work for
services, for custom things. You know, on

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:22.959
the Internet, every television channel is
unique to you. In broadcast, that can't be.

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.720
And so what we've--and so what we did is we'd
extended that media business model beyond

00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:32.650
media to cover services and software and everything
else. And then, over the past five years or

00:16:32.650 --> 00:16:43.280
so, mostly after the dot com bust, we invented
the first new business model, I would argue,

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:47.680
and that is Freemum, which--the free plus
premium equation which I'll get to. My slide

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:53.850
is slightly out of order, but I want to give
one more story from the history of digital

00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:59.580
economics. This is a story taken from Kevin
Kelley's "New Rules." But it was ... In 1963

00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:05.149
the transistor had just been invented and
commercialized by Fairchild, and they needed

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:10.239
to gain market share. And at the time they
were competing-they want to compete for the

00:17:10.239 --> 00:17:16.909
UHF tuner market and--which is dominated by
RCA with the tube at the cost $1.05-it cost

00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:22.309
over $100 to make everyone of the Fairchild's
1211 transistors. And yet they wanted--and

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:25.390
which is functionally identical, actually
functionally slightly superior, but basically

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:29.850
did the same job as the tube. So what they
did is they realized they needed to match

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:35.110
the tube for price. Now, they assumed--there
was enough of the kind of understanding of

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:40.510
quantum effects and scale effects of semiconductors
to know that the price would come down. But

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:46.539
they had to make a bet. They had to make the
bet that the price would come down by 99 percent.

00:17:46.539 --> 00:17:51.919
So what they did is they priced the 1211 at
$1.05, matching the tube even though it cost

00:17:51.919 --> 00:17:58.580
them $100. The effect was they gained more
than 90 percent of the market overnight. And

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:04.700
two years later, with all that volume, the
price not only had come $1.05 but even lower

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:08.639
to 50 cents and they could make money. Now,
one of the cool things about digital-free

00:18:08.639 --> 00:18:13.460
is that it sort of--it sort of makes a mockery
of all of the lessons that we've been told,

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.090
you know, that "There's no such as a free
lunch," et cetera. But the biggest mockery

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:22.049
is that is that old joke that says that, you
know, "I lose on every product but I'm making

00:18:22.049 --> 00:18:25.861
up--make it up in volume," it turns out to
be exactly the way some semiconductors work.

00:18:25.861 --> 00:18:30.520
You can lose money on each one but you make
it up in volume, which is to say that the--that

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:37.080
scaling of products up reduces its cost, you
know, so fast that you can sell ahead of your

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:41.360
price. You can sell it not at what it cost
today, but what it will cost you tomorrow

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:46.169
because the--because, you know, Say's law,
"Supply creates its own demand," that the

00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:49.690
lower price will create so much more demand
and we'll find so many ways to waste these

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:55.509
transistors that the volume will bring your
manufacturing efficiencies down even faster

00:18:55.509 --> 00:19:04.320
than you had expected. And so, this is what
low price can do. And, as you know, transistor

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.919
is now free, essentially, and we waste them--and
we waste them by using for things that no

00:19:10.919 --> 00:19:15.429
one have ever intended before because they
cost so little that we don't have to--don't

00:19:15.429 --> 00:19:21.590
have to consider its underlying expense. I'm
going to talk about Freemum a bit, but first

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:25.080
I wanted to address one of these things you
hear all the time that "You can't compete

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.289
with free" argument. The music industry has
been saying this a long time, how unfair it

00:19:29.289 --> 00:19:33.769
is that music is free because you can't compete
with that. Well, that's rubbish. You can compete

00:19:33.769 --> 00:19:38.960
with free. And a company you're familiar with
this had perhaps the longest history of this.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:44.769
These are the sort of the five--the four decades
of Microsoft's competing with free. 1970s,

00:19:44.769 --> 00:19:50.929
the computer industry was a hardware business.
It was one dominated by IBM and its microcomputers

00:19:50.929 --> 00:19:55.419
and mainframes, and software was something
you got for free. You got the tapes for free;

00:19:55.419 --> 00:20:02.989
it came along with the hardware. And Microsoft
as a software company, a heretofore unknown

00:20:02.989 --> 00:20:08.009
creature said, "Look, if you want software
companies like us to exist, if you want--if

00:20:08.009 --> 00:20:10.770
you want it to be a commercial business of
creating software, you're going to have to

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:14.480
pay for software." And so, this famous letter,
open letter of the hobbyist, Bill Gates, wrote,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.810
explained the underlying and central structure
and tried to get people to pay for what they

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:23.590
used to get for free. And that worked pretty
well. So, many people did and the notion for

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:27.679
paying for software became accepted. Then
in the 1980s they had to compete with free

00:20:27.679 --> 00:20:34.720
in a different way. Now they're moving to
the desktop and their competitors, WordPerfect

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:39.360
and others, were bundling free applications
software with the computers. Now, again, the

00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.980
marginal cost of production of--you know,
marginal cost of putting a software on our

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:48.460
computer is zero. There are some opportunity
cost, which is perhaps that's the sale not

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.919
made, but the expectation would be that if
you got WordPerfect free in you computer,

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:55.149
you'd use WordPerfect to save your files and
WordPerfect if you'd learn the key commands,

00:20:55.149 --> 00:20:59.230
you've all remembered that, and that when
it came time to upgrade you would pay for

00:20:59.230 --> 00:21:04.619
your next version of WordPerfect. So Microsoft
had to--who was selling Word and Excel had

00:21:04.619 --> 00:21:08.019
to compete with the bumbled-free software.
So what did they do? They created Microsoft

00:21:08.019 --> 00:21:15.090
Works which was a way to match the competitors
on price, it was fee, and lock them into Microsoft

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:20.820
file standards. And they--and WordPerfect
is essentially no more, you know, no longer

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:26.409
a force in the marketplace because Microsoft
used free to compete with free. In 1990s,

00:21:26.409 --> 00:21:32.770
they dealt with piracy in China first. Piracy
is the marketplace imposed when the price

00:21:32.770 --> 00:21:38.779
is zero on you. If you don't do it, you know,
the animal forces of digital economics will.

00:21:38.779 --> 00:21:44.370
The pirates can make the price--can duplicate
the CDs and DVDs for, you know, for no marginal

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:51.240
cost and they--and as a result, although the
pirates sell it a low price, it's cheap in

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:56.739
the marketplace, as far as the manufacturers
are concerned, the revenues are zero. So what

00:21:56.739 --> 00:22:04.119
Microsoft did actually is, not what you may
think, which is, you know, send NATO in. Instead,

00:22:04.119 --> 00:22:10.480
they complained a little bit, but secretly
they weren't that upset in their rare moment

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:18.460
of candor. Like I said, China is a developing
economy. If they're going pirate a software,

00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.840
we'd rather that they pirate our software
because someday they will have developed.

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.369
They will be able to pay for software and
then they'll be hooked on ours. I'm paraphrasing.

00:22:26.369 --> 00:22:31.840
"Hooked" may not have been this word. And
that, in fact, works. China did develop. As

00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:37.149
a matter of fact, China developed faster because
Microsoft did not--was not incredibly, you

00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:43.289
know, brutal in it's crackdowns on piracy
because they--because free stuff lowered the

00:22:43.289 --> 00:22:48.399
cost of entering computing, lowered the cost
of computer, over all, it accelerated China's

00:22:48.399 --> 00:22:52.820
adoption of computers, accelerated China's
development, and essentially ensured that

00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.350
China would be ready to pay for software faster.
So that is--so keep that in mind because we're

00:22:58.350 --> 00:23:02.929
going to come back to it. But at the same
time, it was fighting free on another front,

00:23:02.929 --> 00:23:06.779
which is the browser. And Netscape was giving
away the browser for free and to sell the

00:23:06.779 --> 00:23:12.480
server. Microsoft may have once entertained
ideas of selling browsers, it did have some

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.750
proprietary web technologies at that time,
but they clearly had to match the price. So,

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:21.249
they not only gave away the browser for free
but they bundled it with every computer, something

00:23:21.249 --> 00:23:25.220
that Netscape could not do, and that created
some Antitrust issues, which we would also

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:30.440
come back to. So now we had, you know, this
decade and Microsoft's competing with the

00:23:30.440 --> 00:23:38.669
open source; Linux, Apache, MySQL et cetera.
It turns out that you can compete with open

00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:41.320
source. You know, open source have been going
long enough that we'd now understood pretty

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.979
much how the market plays out. You have two
markets. You have the very price-sensitive

00:23:44.979 --> 00:23:49.810
market, and then you have a risk-sensitive
market. What you--you know, today, Microsoft

00:23:49.810 --> 00:23:55.909
competes very well with open source. Enterprises
tend to buy Microsoft, and big, big companies

00:23:55.909 --> 00:23:59.570
would tend to buy Microsoft products, not
always but some––but many do, banks and

00:23:59.570 --> 00:24:05.860
such, and others would tend to buy--tend to
use open source. What Microsoft turns out

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:11.100
to be selling at this point is not software.
What they're selling is a contract, a service

00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.899
level agreement. What they're selling is a
phone number that you can call when things

00:24:13.899 --> 00:24:19.019
go wrong. So what Microsoft is selling is
piece of mind. They're selling risk reduction.

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:26.850
What they're selling is an insurance that
this would do the job that you required. Now,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:30.919
what's important about that is that if you
are a CIO of a big company, you don't care

00:24:30.919 --> 00:24:35.119
as much about money as you care about not
getting fired, not having the whole system

00:24:35.119 --> 00:24:39.340
fall down, et cetera. So, this service-level
contract is actually quite enticing, and when

00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.590
you look at the companies that monetize the
open source, Red Hats and IBM, et cetera,

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:47.070
once again, they're selling the service; they're
selling the phone number; they're selling

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:52.419
the support they're selling the risk reduction.
So, what Microsoft ended up doing was again

00:24:52.419 --> 00:24:56.720
using the software--it's essentially sort
of saying, "We're not in the software business

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.989
anymore. We're in the risk reduction business,
and whether this is sort of appropriate for

00:25:00.989 --> 00:25:05.149
your needs or just that we have a contract
obligation to serve your needs, that's what

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:12.240
you're paying for." Now, what is interesting
is what they're doing now. Microsoft has just

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:18.929
decided to make their older enterprise software
free to startups. There's something called

00:25:18.929 --> 00:25:22.029
Biz Park (ph). If you're less than three years
old and less than a million dollars of revenues,

00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:26.200
you can get all of Microsoft's enterprise
software for free. And what's interesting

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:33.169
about this is that's exactly the Chinese piracy
model. What they're saying is, "You're young,

00:25:33.169 --> 00:25:36.619
you're developing. If you're going to use
free software, we'd like you to use our free

00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:43.029
software. Someday this low cost of entry will
help you develop faster. Once you've developed

00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:46.220
faster and you're ready to pay for software,
we'd like you to pay for ours." So once you

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:50.649
passed a million dollars or three years, you
have to pay and then a hope would be that

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:55.429
you're hooked on Microsoft's software and
you'll buy theirs. So what's interesting is

00:25:55.429 --> 00:26:00.980
that the Chinese piracy market was foreseen,
you know, widely as its parable thing turned

00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:08.480
out to be the exact right business model for
the emerging web business market where the

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:14.039
pirates are now matched--are now replaced
by startups and entrepreneurs and other young

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:19.120
companies who are largely influencing the
marketplace of tomorrow. So, I wanted to end

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.169
with a couple of tactical things about Freemum
which really the most interesting. I think

00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:29.649
Freemum is the first 21st century business
model. Freemum is free plus premium, and it's

00:26:29.649 --> 00:26:34.299
the inversion of the old free sample. So you
go into a department store, you got sprit

00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:38.309
of perfume and, you know, 1 percent will get
the free perfume and 99 will pay. You know,

00:26:38.309 --> 00:26:41.940
Starbucks has a slice of a muffin, 1 percent
will get a taste of free muffin, everyone

00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:44.982
else will pay. The marginal cost of that is
none, zero, and so you need to--you've got

00:26:44.982 --> 00:26:49.420
to be limited in what you give out. Freemum
is just the opposite. You give away 90 percent,

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:53.650
you give away 95 percent for free, what you
do with that free, free becomes a form of

00:26:53.650 --> 00:27:00.879
marketing. [INDISTINCT] have explained to
me the Google strategy is the max strategy.

00:27:00.879 --> 00:27:07.950
Use free to maximize your reach; maximize
your sampling; maximize the consumer awareness

00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:13.679
of the product. Then the consumers try the
product and self-identify as different consumer

00:27:13.679 --> 00:27:16.960
classes. Now, some of them will say, "Hey,
free is good enough for me." But some of them

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.140
may say, "I want more." And the question is,
"What more do they want?" And those people

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:26.879
who want more become the premium. They're
the flicker pros to the flicker. They are

00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:33.009
the, you know--in the software [INDISTINCT]
they're the ones who say, "I want features,

00:27:33.009 --> 00:27:40.289
or I want more capacity or storage or et cetera."
And what we find, broadly, is that every product

00:27:40.289 --> 00:27:44.639
is different and every market is different,
and trying to find [INDISTINCT] your products

00:27:44.639 --> 00:27:49.940
into the frees and the premiums requires understanding
exactly where are people are willing to pay

00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:54.970
more. Once they use the product and they love
the products, they become pricing sensitive.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:58.409
And what we find is that people who convert...
There's two ways to buy software online. One

00:27:58.409 --> 00:28:02.749
is the source say, "Hey, subscribe, or you
can't use it." What you get there is you get

00:28:02.749 --> 00:28:07.990
obviously 100 percent of the users are paid,
but the trim rates are very high. And a lot

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:13.119
of them feel cheated. They didn't know what
they were getting. In the Freemum model where

00:28:13.119 --> 00:28:18.159
people try it first and then are up sold or
convert to the paid thing only when their

00:28:18.159 --> 00:28:23.060
usage patterns are established. They find
the trim rates are much, much lower and they

00:28:23.060 --> 00:28:27.090
become price-insensitive. They are your best
customers because their making a switch for

00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:31.190
the right reason which is that they've tried
the products, they understand it, they get

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.660
to realize it's valuable to them, and price
becomes less important than the utility of

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:39.770
the product itself. The "Wall Street Journal"
is an interesting example in Freemum. A lot

00:28:39.770 --> 00:28:44.259
of people are portraying the newspaper wars
as being free versus paid. But it's not. It's

00:28:44.259 --> 00:28:49.370
free versus Freemum. And Murdock is very clever
about this. And Alan Murray who runs washintonjounal.com

00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:56.070
gives the five rules of web--of newspaper
content. And the first is that you need both,

00:28:56.070 --> 00:29:02.810
free and paid. So that--OK. Many people don't
understand that it's as propulsive at it is.

00:29:02.810 --> 00:29:08.940
The second is quite counterintuitive. You
would have thought an exclusive is exactly

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.730
what you can charge for, right, its unique
content. You know that--you know, you can

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:17.340
only charge for scarcity and exclusives are,
by definition, scarcity. Why do they give

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:22.460
away their exclusives? Because if they don't,
people will report on their exclusives. You

00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:27.309
know, as "TMZ" exclusively reported yesterday,
Michael Jackson has died. You know, the people

00:29:27.309 --> 00:29:32.159
were exclusively reporting, in a free context,
get all the traffic... I mean, it only takes

00:29:32.159 --> 00:29:37.899
only person buy subscription to tmz.com and
then reports on it elsewhere and... So that's

00:29:37.899 --> 00:29:43.059
their concern. Now, the reason--eventually
what they end up doing is they... And then

00:29:43.059 --> 00:29:46.789
we go to three, "Don't charge the most popular
content on your site." What they're doing

00:29:46.789 --> 00:29:50.809
is they're saying--to refer back to my last
book, "The Long Tail", you've got the head

00:29:50.809 --> 00:29:54.789
of the curve which is the really popular stuff.
That's the high-traffic figures; monetize

00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:59.369
that with advertising. Then you got the tail
of the curve. Its niche is specific. At that

00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:04.179
point, people--the traffic levels are too
low to advertising but the engagement levels

00:30:04.179 --> 00:30:09.659
are much higher. This is metals trading news.
At this point, people know why they're there,

00:30:09.659 --> 00:30:12.739
it's relatively unique because there's less
competition in the marketplace for that kind

00:30:12.739 --> 00:30:18.169
of news, and is often responding to people's
professional interest, which is they are price-insensitive.

00:30:18.169 --> 00:30:22.299
It's so meaningful to them that they'll pay
almost any price. In this gets back to Stewart

00:30:22.299 --> 00:30:26.630
Brand's original comment, you know, that "Information
wants to be free," which is exactly half of

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.840
the statement. The statement was, "Some information
wants to be free because digital economics

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.359
allowed it to be so. And some information
wants to be incredibly expensive because its

00:30:34.359 --> 00:30:39.809
value to you is so great." And so, what we
end up is we get abundant commodity... Generic

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:45.740
information wants to be free where specific
customized relevant information can be very

00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:49.509
expensive. So what you'll see with "The Wall
Street Journal" and others is that the deeper

00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:54.700
you go into the, you know, into the details
of the sections and their subject, the more

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.529
likely they are to charge. When you go into
their archives, the more likely they are to

00:30:58.529 --> 00:31:06.710
charge. The narrow is--the tail is paid and
the head is free. And so, what we find is

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:12.210
we're giving away the head, selling the tail
 ... We are monetizing the head with the media

00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:18.120
model and monetizing the tail with the Freemum
model of direct revenues. Both of the models

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:23.040
are free but you don't use the same on across
the boards. And the analogy here is, I think,

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.559
video games. I would encourage you... As you're
looking at the kind of evolution of Freemum,

00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:33.570
the two markets I would encourage you to look
most closely at are the video game market

00:31:33.570 --> 00:31:38.419
and the iPhone Apps market. Video games are
fascinating. This is the--this is the third

00:31:38.419 --> 00:31:42.639
silver disc business to drop the silver disc.
Obviously, we know what happened with music;

00:31:42.639 --> 00:31:48.349
the silver disc is gone, music became free.
The industry prospered, except for the labels.

00:31:48.349 --> 00:31:53.279
Every other aspect of the industry used free
successfully to create celebrity; create recognitions;

00:31:53.279 --> 00:32:00.409
to create sampling; and then they sold towards
merchandize licensing; Apples or a lot of

00:32:00.409 --> 00:32:04.600
iPods;, all of that was based on free. Only
the labels suffered. Then software did the

00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.489
same thing. Software moved online to software
as a service, and that used the Freemum model.

00:32:08.489 --> 00:32:13.020
And now, the video game industry, starting
first in China and Korea, and now the United

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:16.840
States is moving from a packaged consumer
goods model where you're selling a box for

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.679
$50, the silver disc online, and free to play
becomes the default mode. And what you see

00:32:23.679 --> 00:32:28.889
in these games--and you know them as Club
Penguin, Neopets, Webkinz, Maple Story has

00:32:28.889 --> 00:32:34.179
a picture there, but most of these things
is that--what's fascinating is where do they

00:32:34.179 --> 00:32:41.220
charge? It's free to play, but at what point
do you invoke the price tag? And every game

00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:45.669
is different and they try not to make it punitive.
You try not to create a two-tier society where

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:52.580
paying users have, you know, like superpowers
and [INDISTINCT]. Instead there's two ways

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:57.590
to get power. You can earn this with your
time and labor, or you can buy it. So this

00:32:57.590 --> 00:33:03.259
is the classic time-money calculus. With Maple
story, just to give you an example, when you

00:33:03.259 --> 00:33:08.259
die in the game, as a free user, you respond
in a span point and you trudge back to where

00:33:08.259 --> 00:33:13.159
you were. If, however, you buy a reincarnation
stone, you're reincarnated right where you

00:33:13.159 --> 00:33:19.950
were. If you want to go to another world,
you have to wait for the bus which is actually

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:24.460
just a server, it's a server mirror that at
a certain point they kind of cue up everybody

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.450
who's going to switch from one server to the
other and move them all in their batch. Or

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:34.940
you can buy a teleportation stone, and not
like the reincarnation stone, but the teleportation

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.929
stone which allows you to move--and move from
server to server at will. Now, what's interesting

00:33:38.929 --> 00:33:43.590
is that, the first ones completely arbitrary.
Whether you reincarnate here or there is arbitrary.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.860
The teleportation stone actually has some
computational cost associates and you're doing

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:53.200
an inefficient server. But the point is that
you're saving time. And time-money calculus

00:33:53.200 --> 00:34:00.359
is the one universally. Young people have
more time than money so they'll build their

00:34:00.359 --> 00:34:03.760
virtual equity overtime. They'll go with the
force and kill the squirrels or whatever it

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:09.389
is to--it takes to get your gold. Older people
have more money than time and they'll pay

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:16.630
for convenience and labor-saving. People pay
the lower risks on Second Life which is (our)

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:20.149
quite a game but has similar dynamics. If
you want to put down routes and build a house,

00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:24.409
you have to rent some land. That means that
you've got--you've got persistence; you've

00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:29.659
got continuity; that your laborers will remain.
And so, that's another thing that people will

00:34:29.659 --> 00:34:37.289
pay for. Status is a classic. If any of you
have children who are playing Club Penguin,

00:34:37.289 --> 00:34:40.919
you know, very quickly, down the line they're
going to come to you asking for a credit card.

00:34:40.919 --> 00:34:46.179
Why? They want a pet for their penguin. They
want cooler hair, they want a better shirt,

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:50.220
they want a carpet, you know, for their igloo,
they want to go to a cooler land, et cetera.

00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.460
These are all status things. They want it,
they're engaged, they get the game, they want

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:57.849
more, and they'll pay for that. And as you
realize, you're seeing this across the board.

00:34:57.849 --> 00:35:02.900
You know, Facebook gifts and everywhere that
people will pay for status once they're invested

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:08.340
in the reputation economy of that place. And
then, finally, people will pay if you make

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:12.270
them. I mean, you can have this or, ding,
time's up, you got to pay. Ping, is at the

00:35:12.270 --> 00:35:15.650
end of the level, you know, you have to pay
for the next out. They will do it if you make

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:21.000
them, but that's the worst of the possible
options. Much better to find ways to sort

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.380
of, you know, to make them pay for things
they immediately understand the value of;

00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.330
they don't feel disrupted; they don't feel
like there's a gun to their head; they don't

00:35:29.330 --> 00:35:34.630
feel a nickel and a dime; they completely
get the preposition. The other market place

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:41.400
that I'd pointed to is the iPhone Apps, Android
Apps, et cetera, where the first wave was

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:45.829
you got $9.00 and you got free. And free maybe
had add us but probably didn't. And then as

00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:50.829
we get more clever, we ended--realized that
what you typically have is two products. You

00:35:50.829 --> 00:35:53.730
have the free form and then you have the paid
form. Now, sometimes the free form will try

00:35:53.730 --> 00:35:59.570
to up sell you, you know, take off the abs.
Sometimes the free form will say, you know,

00:35:59.570 --> 00:36:04.980
"There's more features so, there's more levels."
And sometimes as we've introduced inter-app

00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:09.539
payment processes, the form will be free and
you'll just pay for more tracks for Tap Tap

00:36:09.539 --> 00:36:15.460
Revolution, or you'll pay for more content
on the fly, and that's the best ones because

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:19.600
it doesn't break the continuity of the flow.
As you get to the point where you're wanting

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:26.039
more, you're really hungry for it, the price
of this additional track or digital asset

00:36:26.039 --> 00:36:31.289
becomes immaterial compared to the reward
you're getting from the participation in that

00:36:31.289 --> 00:36:38.430
it add up in its market place. So, I wanted
to end on wanting credibly controversial note

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:44.730
which is Antitrust, and Google in particular.
At this point, I'm just repeating something

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:50.830
that Alex is called--said in the speech, and
we can continue this in the conversation offline.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:56.760
But he made an observation which is that,
when big companies, especially dominant companies

00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:03.960
with quasi monopolies, use free. It may not--it
may be policy and competition implications

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.880
that are not there when little companies do.
And he drew the following analogy. Microsoft

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:16.560
is using its monopoly rent from Word and Office
to subsidize its entry into Search. Google,

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.559
it using its--I'm not going to use the words
"monopoly rent" here, but Google is using

00:37:20.559 --> 00:37:26.900
its profits from Search to subsidize it's
entry in to Office. When Microsoft does--uses

00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:32.680
free, whether it's bundling software free
with their operating system or distributing

00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:38.470
its Internet Explorer, that is often considered
anti-competitive. The trade analogy is that,

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:44.990
you know, in 1980's when the Japanese dumped
memory chips in the U.S. market, selling under

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:49.599
cost to gain market share and drive out the
competition, that was considered a trade violation.

00:37:49.599 --> 00:37:53.900
And the question--and Microsoft, although
the context has not been so much free as in

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:59.569
tying in market power and distribution efficiencies,
there is the economic aspect to it which is

00:37:59.569 --> 00:38:04.760
that, when companies that have a dominant
position in one area use free, they're selling

00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:09.230
under cost, right? They're selling under cost
to gain market share. Now, it's perfectly

00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:14.150
okay when 37 signals or some other startup
uses free to gain market share. But what if

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:18.661
a company that has a dominant--that is deemed
as being dominant and having a quasi monopoly

00:38:18.661 --> 00:38:23.690
and one market uses free. Is it okay? Are
there limits to where they can use free? Is

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:29.040
it analogous to the dumping argument of the
1980s, or is it entirely different? And I

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:33.610
think that this gets to questions of what
is the market? What is dominance? You know,

00:38:33.610 --> 00:38:37.680
what is fair, what is predatory, all these
things or questions that will take a decade

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:43.570
to figure out. Christine Varney and FTC is
going to start thinking about it now, maybe

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:47.290
someday these will get to the courts. I expect
that over the next decade, we're going to

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:53.250
have to figure out whether free is an antitrust
issue in this market place and I suspect that

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:57.290
the people in this room will probably part
of that in one way or another. I hope you

00:38:57.290 --> 00:39:05.210
guys--I think free should not be seen as predatory
and unfair, but I would not be surprised if

00:39:05.210 --> 00:39:11.089
others make the claim that it is. So, with
that, I will end my Power Point and we can--we

00:39:11.089 --> 00:39:23.270
best set up and turnover to questions. Thanks
very much. By the way, the obvious first question

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:28.950
is, "Is the book free, and how can the book
be free?" Putting aside, briefly, the hard

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:34.000
covers over there which are for sale, well,
the digital forms of the book are free, all

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.549
of them, including Google books. I wished
we had released yesterday, "Kindle", "iPhone

00:39:39.549 --> 00:39:45.039
Apps", "Scribs", audio books, et cetera are
free. The hard cover is premium. This is a

00:39:45.039 --> 00:39:51.630
classic Freemum model, we believe in the book.
We believe that the digital goods are an excellent

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:56.670
sampler, but we believe the physical book
is superior form for enough people that small

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:02.440
a percentage of a large number will be a good
market. All right now, we will find out this

00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:08.920
week whether that's true or whether free books--free
books satisfy demand or stimulate demand?

00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:14.190
We'll see.
&gt;&gt; Okay so, we have mikes on both sides of

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:18.990
the room. Please raise your hands so we're
able to capture this for YouTube. What's your

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:22.700
first question?
&gt;&gt; So, I wonder how this works out in telecom

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:26.119
where the marginal costs of a cell phone call
is also zero but it doesn't seem to have paid

00:40:26.119 --> 00:40:30.460
out in the same way.
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: So, the question was, in telecom

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:35.930
how does this work out? Well, I mean, actually
telecom uses free all the time, right? SO,

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:40.520
long distance phone calls are free on cell
phones, right? So, they demonetized the long

00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:50.589
distance market to increase usage and adherence
and attachment to that carrier. What digital

00:40:50.589 --> 00:40:55.349
economics allow you to do, whatever the marginal
costs of something to zero, it makes price

00:40:55.349 --> 00:41:00.779
arbitrary. Price becomes, almost entirely
psychological not economic. In the Adams economy,

00:41:00.779 --> 00:41:06.299
prices pretty much are function of costs plus,
right? In a digital economy, price is any

00:41:06.299 --> 00:41:11.790
number you want. And it's not about economics,
it's about what is the consumer going to value,

00:41:11.790 --> 00:41:17.680
what are they going to respond to? If you
can give away night time minutes to sell day

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:23.460
time minutes, if you can give away long distance
to sell monthly subscriptions, again, it's

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:28.350
completely arbitrary. You're simply going
on consumer psychology and that's how telecom

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:35.280
is using it. Skype, of course, decided to
sell nothing, and because they could. And

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.369
so what they're doing is capturing consumer
attention to bring out some way to monetize

00:41:39.369 --> 00:41:44.329
that. Yes, sir?
&gt;&gt; You are saying that the companies could

00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:50.210
charge for premium content. Do you think that
there is another obstacles that charging is

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:56.569
so difficult for the, you know, for the buyer
to pay is that there are no convenient ways

00:41:56.569 --> 00:42:01.500
to pay. People probably would pay for a premium
article but, you know, spending 10 minutes

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.999
filling out the forms is no option.
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Absolutely.

00:42:05.999 --> 00:42:10.460
&gt;&gt; And, in that being, what do you think about
micro payments versus subscription?

00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:15.100
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: I'd actually deal with this quite
a bit in the book, the failure of micro payments

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:20.900
today. There are two barriers, there are two
explanations for the failure of micro payments.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:27.029
The first is the one you just said, which
is that the transaction itself is more troubled

00:42:27.029 --> 00:42:33.140
than the revenue opportunity. The second...
And I think overtime that's going to get easier,

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:37.171
the transaction systems are going to get better.
The second one is psychological. The way to

00:42:37.171 --> 00:42:42.680
think about is this, a price, just think of
any price raises a flag in your head and that

00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:49.570
flag is the sort... Is it worth, that flag?
And you know, that flag is work. We have to

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:52.990
think, "Do I want this? How much do I want
this? What's the right price for it?" You

00:42:52.990 --> 00:42:56.619
know, "How should I pay? Do I have enough
money? I might want something else?" These

00:42:56.619 --> 00:43:02.780
all fall under the phrase of "mental transaction
costs." Just processing that sort of, should

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:08.940
I pay, should I not, is work and we are nothing
if not work avoidance machines. So, what Free

00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:14.010
allows you to do is it allows you to thoughtlessly
consume. You don't have to go to that thought

00:43:14.010 --> 00:43:19.640
process. Now, this is what the venture capitalist
Josh Kopelman calls the Penny gap. The difference

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:26.330
in one penny and zero cents is economically
insignificant but psychologically black and

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:31.619
white, night and day. And the problem with
Micropayments is that they all have the psychological

00:43:31.619 --> 00:43:37.390
downsides of a price without any of the revenue
upsides of a real price. So, what's happened

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:42.410
now? When you hear now—when people talk
about Micropayments and you actually look

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:46.619
at what they're talking about, they're talking
about 99 cents, $1.99. Micropayments used

00:43:46.619 --> 00:43:52.369
to be fractional cents. And now they're a
buck, 2 bucks, 3 bucks those are just transactions.

00:43:52.369 --> 00:43:57.140
And at that point, when the transactions engines
become so efficient, be it, you know, the

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:02.570
iPhone, iTune store or the emerging, you know,
the emerging sort of transaction system within

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:12.080
Facebook, within iPod Apps, iPhone Apps, PayPal,
what you guys are going to do with Android

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.410
as well. That side of the barrier at entry
declines. Is that it's you don't have to pull

00:44:17.410 --> 00:44:20.609
out your credit card, you don't have to type
in your details, it's just a thoughtless click.

00:44:20.609 --> 00:44:27.700
The question is, those psychological cost
remain, how far can the price go? How far

00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:35.020
down can that price go where it can still—-the
revenue upside compensates for the psychology

00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:42.140
downside of a real price? Is it 99 cents,
is it 79 cents, is it 29 cents? You know,

00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:47.760
we don't know. But it's now almost entirely
or will be going forward almost entirely about

00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:54.570
psychology, the consumer psychology of price,
rather than that structural problem of the

00:44:54.570 --> 00:45:02.359
transaction hassles itself. Yes?
&gt;&gt; Yes. I wanted to ask you, what are your

00:45:02.359 --> 00:45:06.960
thoughts on Radiohead's experimental awhile
back "Within Rainbow's" where they asked consumers

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.460
to name their own price, most people ended
up paying nothing for it. Would have they

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:15.500
been better off just saying, "Here's the free
and we'll make our money off concerts and

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:18.240
off premium CDs and everything like that."
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Yes, that's a great question.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:26.240
So, what Radiohead did is a classic product
segmentation strategy. So, in the old days

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.519
of music you pretty much had three prices.
There was the album, the single, and the tour.

00:45:31.519 --> 00:45:38.549
So, it was like, 15 bucks, 5 bucks, and $85,
okay. So, what Radiohead did, is they basically

00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:44.640
introduced not three skews or 15 skews, but
something like 35 skews; different forms of

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:49.160
the album. So, there was--actually those were
just the products. There were the individual

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.020
tracks; they were tracks of different bit
rates; there was the vinyl; there was the

00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:57.569
CD; there was the box set; there was the box;
there was the book; there was the video; there

00:45:57.569 --> 00:46:03.480
was the concert tour; there were the T-shirts.
You know, it went on, I'm sure there were

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:08.400
the action figures—-I didn't see it, I wouldn't
be surprised. So, what they did is rather

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.920
than having three prices they had, you know,
they had at least 30 for the skews then you

00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:18.450
can name your own price. So, they had an infinite
continuum of prices ranging from zero all

00:46:18.450 --> 00:46:24.170
the way to front row seats in Wembley Stadium
that's, you know, at $500. What that allows

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:29.740
you to do is it allows you to maximize the
economic value in the market place. By letting

00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:34.460
people choose their own price, they were able
to, you know, to get the people who-—not

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:38.900
only the people who want to pay less but also
the people who are willing to pay more. By

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:42.821
having this difference--by saying, "Well,
it's not that you get the album, the single

00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:47.770
or the tour but also for our super fans, there's
the $100 box set," they're able to tap that

00:46:47.770 --> 00:46:51.650
side of the market as well. And by using Free,
as one of the options, they're able to, not

00:46:51.650 --> 00:46:56.890
only maximize the reach and let everyone sample
the album, but they also got lot of attention

00:46:56.890 --> 00:46:59.690
for the experiment in the first place. The
result was, they had the most successful tour

00:46:59.690 --> 00:47:04.490
in their history, they had the most box set
sold-don't hold me on this number, I maybe

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:08.940
making it up-I think they sold a hundred thousand
of the box sets at the very high price. It

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:12.910
was one of the, I think, one of the most successful
albums, if not, the most successful album.

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:20.630
It was a total economic win along all lines
and they did it by being clever about offering

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:25.220
lots of premiums to go with there free. They
segmented their products into lots of different

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:32.009
price categories and lots of different audience
categories ranging from not very engage—-I've

00:47:32.009 --> 00:47:35.270
never heard Radiohead just want to sample
one—-all the way to, "Oh my God. I love

00:47:35.270 --> 00:47:40.720
Radiohead. I want everything they do and more."
And that, I think, is what all of us have

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:45.240
to do, I think, we in the media industry,
we need to figure out, we know... I'm a magazine

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:51.640
editor. We have Zero, that's our website,
$5 that's our newsstand price and 80 cents.

00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:59.970
That's $10 a year divided by 12 issues, 80ish.
That's not enough. Where's our 29.95? Where's

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:05.680
our 39.95? Where's our 99.95? Where's our
Radiohead? Where's our pet for our penguin?

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:10.330
You know, how are we going to find ways? We
use Free, we use Free successfully. Now, we

00:48:10.330 --> 00:48:15.309
need to figure out how to use free to charge
more. How to segment our audience into—-not

00:48:15.309 --> 00:48:18.730
just hose who came in at those three prices,
but those who, maybe if we could have packaged

00:48:18.730 --> 00:48:23.190
what we do in different ways including the
physical experience, we could charge a lot

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:27.150
more. If you followed recently the scandal
over the Washington Post charging $25,000

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:35.009
to have lunch--dinner with the editors, that
was their effort to find a pet for your penguin.

00:48:35.009 --> 00:48:41.910
Yes.
&gt;&gt; Do you think that Free has changed the

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:47.119
users' or the consumers' concept of quality?
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Yes, that's a great question.

00:48:47.119 --> 00:48:49.839
It is also addressed somewhat in the book.
But there's—-you know, you get what you

00:48:49.839 --> 00:48:54.700
pay for, right, there's this conception. Interestingly,
there's another author named, Ellen Ruppel

00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:58.279
Shell, who came out with a book at the same
time called "Cheap: The High Price of Discount

00:48:58.279 --> 00:49:04.609
Culture." But there's a general... So, it's
all based on your starting position. I tell

00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:09.190
the story of the "Village Voice" which is
a weekly newspaper in New York that went free

00:49:09.190 --> 00:49:14.119
and everyone said... You know, when they went
free their quality declined. You know, that

00:49:14.119 --> 00:49:19.240
you get what you paid for and that the free
reflected the underlying values. Not actually

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:23.119
true, I would argue, but that's what people
thought. But no one thinks that Google is

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:27.559
a worst search engine because it's free and
that's because our expectation, our correlation

00:49:27.559 --> 00:49:34.440
between price and quality was never set above
zero, and it's all based on that. If a product

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:39.060
starts at zero, you don't use price as a test
of quality. If a product starts at a price

00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.819
and goes to zero, you might think that it
was worth less. Now, there are exemptions

00:49:43.819 --> 00:49:49.549
to the rule, Yahoomail, I told the story of
Yahoomail versus Gmail in the book. Yahoomail

00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:53.119
was 5 megabytes for free and anything more
you have to pay for it—-I think it was 29.95

00:49:53.119 --> 00:49:57.799
a year—-they--with the release of Gmail,
they [INDISTINCT] that business. They basically

00:49:57.799 --> 00:50:04.789
went to infinite storage for free, forever.
Because Gmail had entered the market at, I

00:50:04.789 --> 00:50:10.930
think, a gigabyte for free, people didn't
think that Yahoomail had declined in quality

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.620
as a result. In other words, Gmail reset the
consumer correlation between price and quality.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:19.849
I think in the digital space, in the physical
space, I think we have a very clean connection

00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:24.920
between price and quality. And if it says,
you know, if it says—-if something is free

00:50:24.920 --> 00:50:29.099
and, you know, pair of socks is free, you
probably should expect they're not the best

00:50:29.099 --> 00:50:33.990
socks in the world. In the digital space,
I don't think we make that same correlation

00:50:33.990 --> 00:50:38.059
because we understand that the subsidies can
be so defuse and the underline cost are so

00:50:38.059 --> 00:50:42.109
low that we don't assume that only crap is
free.

00:50:42.109 --> 00:50:47.010
&gt;&gt; Okay, our last question.
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: We have another over here but

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:53.349
if we have...
&gt;&gt; When you were talking about the newspaper

00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:57.009
business, you were saying that, you know,
you can have these articles that were sort

00:50:57.009 --> 00:51:01.299
of the mass articles and you distribute them
for free and then you have the niche articles

00:51:01.299 --> 00:51:06.529
and you charged for them. Does that create
an incentive for writers and for reporters

00:51:06.529 --> 00:51:10.849
and what not to only seek the niche articles,
right, especially if you have search engines

00:51:10.849 --> 00:51:15.231
like Google driving a lot of the traffic?
You know, you don't need the mainstream article

00:51:15.231 --> 00:51:18.130
to drive traffic to your niche article because
you have the search engine.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:21.400
&gt;&gt; Fox: Right.
&gt;&gt; Does that cause, you know, the mainstream

00:51:21.400 --> 00:51:24.230
article to just vanish?
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: No. Maybe I should be little

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:28.810
more precise about that. My point is that,
you monetize the mainstream articles with

00:51:28.810 --> 00:51:33.849
advertising and the niche articles with direct
revenues. So, they're both paid. They just--one

00:51:33.849 --> 00:51:40.329
uses the medium model the other uses the Freemum
model. Now, obviously, you know, the head

00:51:40.329 --> 00:51:44.230
of the curve, the really popular ones, not
only serve the virtue of being able to pay

00:51:44.230 --> 00:51:48.599
for themselves on volume, but they're also
great marketing tool. They create awareness

00:51:48.599 --> 00:51:51.960
and they drive demand down the tail to the
paid ones. So, I would argue that the usual

00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:58.249
incentives of, you know, write about celebrities
will remain, good or bad as that maybe.

00:51:58.249 --> 00:52:01.599
&gt;&gt; I guess you have time, you're up.
&gt;&gt; Is it time, we have one question over here.

00:52:01.599 --> 00:52:05.559
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; I have the same question about the quality

00:52:05.559 --> 00:52:12.480
associated with Free and as a follow up, isn't
there a sort of skepticism that's associated

00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.630
with Free also especially in the digital world?
Say, like, "Oh, what's the catch?" I feel

00:52:17.630 --> 00:52:21.206
like Google 10 years from now is going to
say, "We charge $100,000 a year to use all

00:52:21.206 --> 00:52:27.240
of our products, you know what I mean? So
isn't there a type of skepticism that is also

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:29.071
associated?
&gt;&gt; ANDERSON: Yeah, that's a—-it's great

00:52:29.071 --> 00:52:32.950
question. And what we've learned overtime
as we talk to more and more companies about

00:52:32.950 --> 00:52:38.240
this is that very important that people understand
your business model, up front. Because if

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:42.000
it's like free and there is no apparent business
model, they're rightly suspicious that you

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.089
are going to sell their personal information
or there's going to be some privacy to that

00:52:45.089 --> 00:52:48.870
suddenly once you got hooked, it's going to
be very expensive. If it's obvious of how

00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:54.319
you're making money, it doesn't matter whether
I'm paying as long as I can see that somebody

00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:58.750
is paying then the logic of the whole thing
makes sense and I don't feel that it's a set-up.

00:52:58.750 --> 00:53:04.109
So, the fact that Google is using a third
party to subsidies Search, reassures me that

00:53:04.109 --> 00:53:08.390
you are not going to, you know, someday, you
know, Window's going to pop up and say, "Like

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:13.839
Google? Start paying." Now, you may do that
in the end, but the underlying logic of business

00:53:13.839 --> 00:53:24.940
model is apparent enough. So, that again,
invokes psychology. People use to expect that

00:53:24.940 --> 00:53:32.279
were going to pay sooner or later, and it
was just a question of what's the catch? Now,

00:53:32.279 --> 00:53:35.960
they just want to insure that somebody is
paying. It's probably not them, but as long

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:39.480
as somebody's paying, the whole logic of the
whole thing kicks in and they can address

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:43.811
the product for what it is rather than watching
for the catch. I think it's all we have time

00:53:43.811 --> 00:53:44.579
for, thank you so much.
