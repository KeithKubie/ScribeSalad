&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.070
&gt;&gt; Eli Campbell: I'm am the
Programming Coordinator here

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.750
at Hill Center, and I'm
really pleased to see you all.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.810
Can I ask quickly how many of
you are here for the first time?

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.110
Excellent.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:27.410
Well, welcome.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.250
I love to see new faces,
and I hope you check

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.910
out the programming samplers
that I put on your chairs.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.470
There's lots of great new promo

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.150
about upcoming events
in December.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.800
We have some really cool things
going on here all the time.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.140
So, hopefully, we'll
see your faces again.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.440
Before we get started, I want

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.720
to thank the Capitol Hill
Community Foundation,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.900
without whom we wouldn't be able

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.970
to offer free programming
like this.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.230
They are a rock in
this neighborhood,

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.920
and we are so happy to be
in partnership with them.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.510
Now, I'd like to
introduce Mr. Rob Casper.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.040
[ Applause ]

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.690
&gt;&gt; Rob Casper: And, thanks to
everyone here, Charlotte Harper,

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.710
[inaudible], and everyone
at the Hill Center

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.760
for helping organize this event.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.780
Also, great thanks to
the Washington Post

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
for their ongoing support
and to Ron Charles the head

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.890
of the Washington
Post Book World

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.650
who is our moderator and guide.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.100
I'll say a little
bit more about Ron

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.790
and his extraordinary
work a little bit later.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.690
Also, I just want to say, so you
know, E City Books is outside

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.380
with copies of Ray's
books for sale,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.120
should you [inaudible]
find some books,

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.070
have her sign them, [inaudible].

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.480
And, Christmas is coming up.

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.780
Let me tell you a little bit

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.120
about the poetry
literature center

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.700
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.530
We are home to the Poet
Laureate Consultant in Poetry.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.270
The only federally funded
position for a literary artist

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.100
in this country,
but we do run events

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.040
like this throughout
the year now.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.630
We, at the library and the
Hill Center, but in D.C.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.200
and around the country, too.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.310
If you want to find out
more about our events,

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.990
you can go to our website,
www.loc.gov/poetry.

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.290
And, now, Rae Armantrout
let me introduce her

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.590
to conclude our series
this year.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.400
Armantrout was born in
Vallejo, California in 1947,

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.610
and grew up in San Diego.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.080
She holds degrees
from the University

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.670
of California Berkeley where
she studied with Denise Levertov

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.370
and San Francisco
State University.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.520
Her 12 books of poetry include
"Partly: New and Selected Poems,

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.150
2001-2015", published in
the last year, and "Versed"

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.660
which received the
2010 Pulitzer Prize

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.130
and the 2009 National Book
Critics Circle Award for Poetry.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.820
Ron has all three of those books

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.220
which he will reference
this evening.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.210
In 1998, she also published
a prose memoir, "True",

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.160
and her selected prose
was published in 2007.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.090
Armantrout's other honors
include and award in poetry

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.730
from the Foundation
for Contemporary Arts,

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.840
two grants from the Fund
for Poetry, and fellowships

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.460
from the California Arts
Council, the Rockefeller Center,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.810
and the Guggenheim Foundation.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.200
For almost 20 years, she taught
at the University of California,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.510
San Diego, and now,
Armantrout lives in Everett,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.530
Washington with her
husband Chuck.

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.710
In the four years of presenting
"Life of a Poet", I have gotten

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.660
to watch Ron work his magic

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.040
with over a dozen poets
including many old friends.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.010
However, Rae is the first
poet that I once interviewed

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.170
who I got to see in this year's.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.150
[inaudible] "Life of a Poet"
over dinner last night,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.290
I got to thinking about what
approach Ron would take,

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.100
what topics and poems
he'd delve into,

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.720
how he'd direct the
conversation,

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.090
and even how he might
ask us to take a break.

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.840
And, then, I realized
anew how thankful I am

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.480
for his vision in
this [inaudible].

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.270
I'm also eager to see what
tonight's conversation will

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.340
teach me about Rae's work.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.640
My interview with her nine
years ago began and ended

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.900
with questions about meaning,
from a phone bill to a dream.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.920
And, I bet that by the time
Ron and Rae are finished,

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.710
we may know more about and
be wonderfully mystified

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:25.040
by what our language
does for us.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.510
Please join me in welcoming
Ron Charles [inaudible].

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:35.340
[ Applause ]

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.640
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Ron
and Rae, huh?

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:37.940
I like that.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.240
Thank you all for
coming, very much.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.570
It's great to see you,
and it's been a pleasure

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:41.870
to read your poems.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.170
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Thank you.

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.470
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank
you very much for coming.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.110
I've been wanting to ask you, do
poems just pop into your head?

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.930
You're laughing because
that is the opening

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:52.250
of a satirical poem you
wrote about being interviewed

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.050
by an unprepared journalist.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.110
[ Laughter ]

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.500
Would you start with that poem?

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.800
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Sure.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.400
In fact, what this person
said was actually not,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.260
"Do poems just pop
into your head,"

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.740
but "Do words just
pop into your head."

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.250
And, I kind of assume that
words pop into everyone's head.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.360
How else do we ever
say anything?

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:17.190
So, I decided that what I would
do with this, this was right

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.380
after I won the Pulitzer,
so that meant that I had

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.200
to do a lot of interviews, and
some of them were, you know,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.680
the interviewers were prepared.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.050
And, sometimes, they weren't.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.860
Like, the local paper
in San Diego came out,

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.540
and it's not a terribly
good paper.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.160
I'm sorry I just said that.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.050
Anyway. They hate me anyway.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:40.660
So, I got asked some questions
like this, and I decided the way

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.350
to go with it when
writing a poem was just

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.860
to kind of put on a voice.

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.430
And, the questions are questions
that I was really asked,

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.990
and the answers are
not the answers I gave.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.700
They're kind of an alter ego
answer, a sort of, a kind of,

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:04.040
I imagine myself as
kind of a dark persona

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.360
when I'm answering
the questions.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.800
Okay. "Legacy".

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.560
"Do words just pop
into your head?

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:16.340
Some may go unexploded.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.550
Have you thought much
about your legacy?

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:21.870
I'm a legacy prisoner.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.080
No, I'm not.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.640
What do you call precious?

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.840
The precious doesn't get
around much, so it stays small.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:38.220
Or it orbits the same small
pronoun, a kid on a carousel.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:39.740
'Look at me!'

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:44.150
It fiddles with itself,
but I've got bigger things

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.890
to pick up and put down."

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.490
Thank you very much.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.950
Now, when you win a prize
like that, as you say,

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.610
you do get interviewed a lot.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.660
It's one of the times during
the year when the audience

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.980
for poetry expands very large.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.280
You get interviewed

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.400
on the MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour, for instance.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.240
Right? You get interviewed
in all the newspaper.

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.590
NPR calls you.

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.380
The New York Times wants to
do a profile, and you have

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:13.150
to explain poetry
to a general reader.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.450
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:16.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In a way that
is sudden and maybe difficult.

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.020
You've been associated

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.190
with a group called the
Language Poets since the 1970s.

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.360
That's a particularly
unilluminating label.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.660
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:28.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
Language Poets.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.420
What else would they
be, after all?

00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.720
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Exactly.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.380
I've said that many
times myself.

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:34.680
I think.

00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's not
as bad as New Criticism

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.780
which is a useless label,
but it's pretty bad.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.650
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Modernism post-post-modernism.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah, so
what are the Language Poets?

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.380
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I
can talk about what, you know,

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.860
I mean, one thing I can say
is that we are, or were,

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.060
a group of friends who
developed an aesthetic together

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:53.360
when we were kids.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.870
I mean, just kids, like
Patty Smith, in our 20s.

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.170
That's one thing.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.880
We, of course, needless to say,

00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:03.020
didn't name ourselves
The Language Poets,

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.320
because who would do that?

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.620
It's stupid.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.150
[ Laughter ]

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.180
But, that was something
that was a name

00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.570
that a magazine called
Poetry Flash came up with,

00:08:13.570 --> 00:08:15.330
and it somehow just stuck.

00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.310
And, finally, we just
sort of accepted it.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:22.440
And, part of it came from a
magazine that Bruce Andrews

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.980
and Charles Bernstein edited
that was called Language,

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.920
but it had equal signs
between all the letters

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.220
in the word Language.

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:37.110
And, so that was on, that
was in New York, and so,

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:40.130
the poets who came to be
called The Language Poets were

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:42.290
in either in New York
or in San Francisco.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.730
And, I was in San
Francisco at the time.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.680
And, you know, we were, we
were different, I think,

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:53.740
in our aesthetics, the New York
side and the San Francisco side,

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:56.580
but we were also
different as individuals.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.860
And, the problem with, you
know, group labels is they,

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.580
they're kind of homogenizing.

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:02.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.180
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: But, I
do think that, you know,

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:08.410
I did learn from being involved
in that sort of group formation,

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.020
group activity, group
thinking together, community.

00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.890
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
something about you

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:17.260
that would distinguish you as
a group, what would that be?

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:18.560
How would you distinguish
yourselves

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.860
from the Romantic Poets?

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.160
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.790
We were definitely not romantic.

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:28.560
I think we were coming of
age and forming in the '70s,

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.520
and it was, we were coming

00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:34.340
out of the period
of the Vietnam War.

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.250
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
were protest poets?

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:39.030
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Not directly
exactly, but we were sort

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.350
of dealing with the
fact of what happened

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.800
to language during the
Vietnam War, the spin.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:51.090
You know, the, having to destroy
a village in order to save it.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:53.060
You know, that kind of thing.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You
were [inaudible].

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.660
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: The freedom.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.960
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
distortion of language.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.260
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.560
The Freedom Hamlets,
remember that?

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.860
If you're old enough, you know.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.850
So, I think that those
were early examples

00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:09.680
of what we now call spin, and,
yeah, distortions of language

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.510
that made us both want to
be very attuned to language

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:16.610
and also sort of want
to either unspin it

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:19.430
or spin it in a different way.

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:23.210
So, that's one thing, a kind
of attitude of suspiciousness.

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:24.910
Like, what did I just hear?

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.180
How can I parse that?

00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.620
You know, how can I think
about what it really means

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:33.860
and what the motivation
behind that remark might be?

00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:40.540
So, that's one thing that we had
in common is a kind of desire

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.120
that was both positive and
negative to look at language

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.670
as an object, sort of.

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.760
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: One critic says
that "Language poetry intends

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.330
for the reader to participate

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.890
in creating the meaning
of the poem".

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.190
Which, I'm going
to read that again,

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:56.390
because it doesn't
make any sense.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:59.540
"Language poetry intends for
the reader to participate

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.740
in the creating the
meaning of the poem."

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.170
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Probably
readers always do that.

00:11:04.170 --> 00:11:05.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's
what I would think.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:06.950
Otherwise, you wouldn't
be conscious

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.830
when you're reading the poem.

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:11.820
So, how did that get to be
associated with you all?

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.400
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I
think that one thing that a lot

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.640
of The Language Poets did is,
and this is true of me, too.

00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:21.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.240
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
In my own way,

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.940
which is not the same
as all of their ways.

00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:29.320
But, is that units
within a poem,

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:35.660
whether the unit is a sentence
or a stanza or a section,

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.860
the units tend to be
sort of semi-autonomous.

00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:41.940
They have, they are
something in themselves,

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.800
and then how they
connect with the next unit

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.130
or the next sentence
is sort of oblique.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:53.000
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
And, indirect,

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.840
and I hope that there
is a relation, you know,

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.250
but it's not, there's not a lot

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.360
of walking the reader
through it.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.960
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: You know.

00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Different
readers can come

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.560
up with radically
different reactions.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:06.860
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right.

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:08.160
Exactly.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That would
be equally [inaudible].

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.760
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:13.360
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well,
I don't know what equally,

00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.660
but, I mean, there are.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:15.960
I mean, I think you
could, one could push

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.260
that argument too far.

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.560
I mean, I think there are
wrong ways to read poems,

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.860
but there is probably a little,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.160
definitely more than
one right way.

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.460
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:23.760
All right.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.060
Want you to read a poem.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:26.360
There's number three here.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.050
In, where am I?

00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:34.130
This is a fairly
early poem, I think.

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:35.430
"My Problem".

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:37.730
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:42.880
I guess I won't give
this any kind of preface.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You can.

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.480
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: No.

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:46.780
I'm going to talk
about it afterwards.

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:48.080
"My Problem.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:52.150
It is my responsibility
to squeeze the present

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:56.600
from the past by
demanding particulars.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:13:00.860
When the dog is used to
represent the inner man,

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.000
I need to ask, 'What
kind of dog is it?'

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.110
If a parasitic metaphor
grows all throughout, good!

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.760
Why stop with a barnacle?

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:18.210
A honeysuckle, thrown like an
arm around a chain-link fence,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:23.020
would be far more articulated,
more precisely repetitive,

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:29.500
giving me the feeling that I can
go on like this while the woman

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:32.960
at the next table says,
'You smell pretty,

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.860
and sends her small daughter's
laugh, a spluttery orgasm,

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.560
into my ear, though this may
not have been what you intended.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.130
It may not be a problem

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:48.140
when I notice the way
the person shifts."

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.280
Can I hold, you want it?

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:52.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.880
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:55.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [inaudible]
held a [inaudible] here.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:56.480
Now, "When the dog is used
to represent the inner man,

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.640
I need to ask, 'What kind of
dog is it?'" You're demanding,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:03.190
you're putting some
pressure on the language here

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:05.650
within the poem which is
about language, right?

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:06.950
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah, yeah.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:09.950
Well, actually, you know, I,
for a long time, I taught,

00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:14.930
and some of the material in
the poem comes from things

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.570
that I found myself
saying to students.

00:14:17.570 --> 00:14:19.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You demanded
particulars from them.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:20.710
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.010
Yeah, yeah.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:23.310
Yeah. Because, you know,

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.610
it's better for a
poem to be specific.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.570
Or, I think, actually, at that
time, not that it matters,

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.240
I was teaching a course called
Personal Narrative, because some

00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:31.850
of this was actually prose.

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.410
But, you know, I'm
sort of making fun

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.980
of symbols there, in a way.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.320
"If the dog is used to
represent the inner man."

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.920
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: So,
that's turning your dog

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.220
into a symbol of yourself.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.520
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:46.820
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Which is
the way we arrogant humans are.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:49.450
The dog must be me.

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:53.890
So, then, instead of saying to
the student, "Well, you know,

00:14:53.890 --> 00:14:56.630
isn't that kind of
anthropomorphizing,

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.210
sort of arrogant
and problematic?"

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:01.570
Instead, I would say, "Well,
what kind of dog is it?"

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:04.270
just to, you know, pour them
into technically better writing

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.230
by making them be more specific.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.800
So, I'm sort of making fun
of my own comments in a way.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.850
Not so much making
fun of the students.

00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:12.350
They're young, but, you know.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:15.380
But, when you teach, you say
the same things, kinds of things

00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.010
over and over until
you get tired of.

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:18.310
[ Laughter ]

00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:19.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.630
Yeah. I remember thinking
each fall, "My god,

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.380
these kids haven't
learned anything."

00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.870
They were all new.

00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:26.170
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.470
Right.

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: [inaudible]
I was talking to last year.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.100
Yeah. I love this poem
because it makes me think

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:40.340
about what poetry does in a very
clever, creative, specific way,

00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:43.060
but it isn't just about poetry.

00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.360
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: No.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.830
I suppose not.

00:15:45.830 --> 00:15:47.650
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:48.950
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah, part

00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.770
of it is just me taking
in my environment.

00:15:51.770 --> 00:15:56.130
I was, as a matter of fact, I
was grading papers at a café,

00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.010
at an outdoor café because
I lived in San Diego.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:02.010
And, there was a honeysuckle,

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.210
and there was a woman
with her daughter.

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:06.490
And so, everything
around me is coming.

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:07.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Coming.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:09.090
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Coming into
my consciousness, and therefore,

00:16:09.090 --> 00:16:10.810
sort of invading the poem.

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:12.110
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.410
Very nice.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.690
Here's another one called "Craft
Talk" which is very specifically

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.140
about the craft of poetry.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.440
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right,
and that's going to be

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.760
in my upcoming book, "Wobble".

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:22.440
I'm advertising it.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.880
Which is coming out
next September.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:26.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Congratulations.

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:29.060
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: And,
this is a prose poem.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.440
So, another thing that happens

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.050
to me besides being
interviewed is being asked

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.490
to do craft talks.

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:38.890
Some of you may be familiar
with that, and in a craft talk,

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:43.420
you're sort of asked to say
what you think a good poem is.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:44.720
Or, what poetry should do.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.690
And, I'm not very comfortable

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.980
with prescriptions,
being prescriptive.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:56.050
I mean, I have ideas about what
poetry can do, but my problem is

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:58.850
that I'm ambivalent
about modern ideas.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.680
You know, I'm, as soon as I have
an idea, I go, "Is that true?

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:02.980
Wait a minute.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:04.280
There's probably
ways it's not true."

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.500
So, that's kind of
what this comes out of.

00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.760
"The Craft Talk.

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:12.260
So that the best thing
you could do, it seemed,

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.000
was climb inside the
machine that was language

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.800
and feel what it wanted or was
capable of doing at any point,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.020
steering only occasionally.

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:25.320
The best thing was

00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.880
to let language speak its piece
while standing inside it -

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.140
not like a knight
in armor exactly,

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:37.220
not like a mascot
in a chicken suit.

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:39.740
The best thing was to
create in the reader

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:42.860
or listener an uncertainty as to

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:46.070
where the voice she
heard was coming from so

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.860
as to frighten her a little.

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.660
Why should I want
to frighten her?"

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:53.310
[ Laughter ]

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:54.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Thank you.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:17:59.040
And, your poems do
that repeatedly.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.000
The voice switches on
us in surprising ways.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.300
The tone switches.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:04.600
These are intentional
things you're doing.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.030
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
I hope so, yeah.

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:08.040
[ Laughter ]

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.880
I really, you know, actually,
that's, that is a good question

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.880
because it's intentional,
I suppose,

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.180
but it's also ingrained.

00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.480
It's also just the way I am.

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:19.780
So, maybe it's not intentional.

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.080
[ Laughter ]

00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:22.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You're
doing it to me now.

00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.920
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.160
[ Laughter ]

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And, you make
fun of the idea of the poet

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:34.190
as the authority who's in
total control of the language.

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:38.100
In your version, you sort
of mock that whole idea.

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.400
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.370
Right. I mean, I do,
I do different voices.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:43.670
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:44.970
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: In my poems.

00:18:44.970 --> 00:18:46.700
You know, I suppose,
because it's famous,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.670
but the working title
for "The Wasteland" was

00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:52.310
"He Do the Police in
Different Voices".

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:54.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I
did not know that.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.780
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I love that.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.440
It should have been the title
of "The Wasteland", I think.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.740
But, anyway.

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:00.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No!

00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:02.350
[ Laughter ]

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:03.650
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
But, you know,

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.820
I do the police in
different voices.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:12.620
So, sometimes, I'll just hear
something, overhear something,

00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:15.890
or read something,
and just want to take

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:19.560
that voice wherever it
can go and take it further

00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:23.730
and maybe take it to somewhere
problematic that it seems

00:19:23.730 --> 00:19:26.080
like it has the potential to go.

00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:29.920
So, there are, there
are plenty of voices

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:40.060
in my poems saying things in a
way I don't stand by or mean.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.360
They just, these voices just
sort of run to where they go.

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.040
And then, I take a
look at that, I guess.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.240
Right. You say in one poem
called "Approximate", "Wait,

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:53.150
I haven't found the
right word yet.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:55.150
Poem means homeostasis."

00:19:55.150 --> 00:19:57.280
[ Laughter ]

00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:00.330
A word I, I mean, I had a vague
idea of what that word meant,

00:20:00.330 --> 00:20:02.280
but it's some sort of.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.870
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Poem doesn't
really mean that, of course.

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.790
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
it's ironic.

00:20:06.790 --> 00:20:08.090
It's ironic, isn't it?

00:20:08.090 --> 00:20:11.870
In another poem, you write,
"A word is mostly connotation.

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:14.930
Matter is mostly aura.

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:17.060
Each poem says, 'I'm
desperate'."

00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.740
Each poem.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:20.430
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
[laughter] Everything must go.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.090
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes,
about the sale.

00:20:22.090 --> 00:20:24.200
What do you mean by that?

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.500
"I'm desperate."

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:26.800
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Part of it.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.100
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The
"I'm desperate" part.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:32.660
I like the energy of that, what
it suggests about the poet.

00:20:32.660 --> 00:20:33.960
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Can I?

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.260
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.560
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I think.

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is
from "Make It New", right?

00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:39.890
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:41.190
"Make It New".

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:45.470
So, is that in, what's that in?

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:47.790
I've lost track of my own.

00:20:47.790 --> 00:20:50.230
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There's
a lot of them here.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:52.010
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: So,
is it in "Next Life"?

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:53.480
Okay. Good.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:54.780
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There?

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:56.080
Yeah.

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.380
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: All right.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:58.680
Right. Right.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.980
Right. Right.

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:01.280
Okay.

00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:02.580
So, "Make It New" is the title
of that, and it comes from,

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:03.880
that's one of Ezra
Pound's maxims.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.650
So, it's one of the
maxims of modernism.

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.390
And, you know, when
you're making it new,

00:21:09.390 --> 00:21:11.200
you have to get rid of the old.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.950
So, each poem says,
"I'm desperate.

00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:15.700
Everything must go."

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.160
So, it's kind of like a yard
sale or, you know, a closing,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.940
going out of business sale.

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.510
Past has to go.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:25.600
And, it's sort of,
this poem was sort

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.840
of also constructed
like a road trip.

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.130
"The steady pressure on the
accelerator can be stipulated

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:34.650
in advance as can
the steady bushes,

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.150
blurred in peripheral vision."

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:39.040
So, we know what we're going
to see on this road trip.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.360
It's, we've seen it before.

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.660
We're going to see
the same thing.

00:21:41.660 --> 00:21:44.240
A diner or a gas
station comes up.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.120
Tried evoking it

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.130
"while satirizing the
impulse to do so."

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:52.540
So, in a way, it's a poem about
being jaded until the end.

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.200
"What that name will be is
the one thing we don't know."

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:57.500
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Read
the whole thing.

00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.800
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.670
Okay. "Make It New.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:06.430
Shaking the parts of speech
like fluff in the snow globe --

00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:10.610
the way sleep scrambles
life's detritus.

00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:17.110
Each poem says, 'I'm desperate,'
then, 'Everything must go!"

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:22.880
(To hear something familiar
here leads to careful laughter.)

00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.660
'Go' where?

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:28.490
The steady pressure on the
accelerator can be stipulated

00:22:28.490 --> 00:22:32.670
in advance as can
the steady bushes,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.570
blurred in peripheral vision.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:40.150
And, someone will have set
down a diner or a gas station

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.620
at a desolate crossroads
and tried naming it

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:48.370
to evoke the whole human
situation while satirizing the

00:22:48.370 --> 00:22:50.730
impulse to do so.

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:54.000
What that name will be, is
the one thing we don't know."

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.300
[laughs]

00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:59.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The way you
do something and satirize it

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:02.840
at the same time amazes me
repeatedly in these poems.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.140
You know, [laughs].

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:09.280
Also, I love the opening
of that, shaking the parts

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.850
of speech like a snow
globe is a great metaphor.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:16.130
In a poem called "Meant",
you write, "'Poetry wants

00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:20.600
to make things mean more than
they mean', says someone,

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.940
as if we knew how
much things meant

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.910
or in what unit of measure."

00:23:24.910 --> 00:23:26.210
Want to read that poem?

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.370
That's called, that's
in "Just Saying."

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:31.410
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
It's towards the end.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes, it is.

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.000

When the rat rests, its
brain runs the maze again,

then runs it backwards,
and repeats.

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.870
This is early music.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:56.000
'Poetry wants to make things
mean more than they mean',

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.270
says someone, as if we
knew how much things meant,

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:04.440
and in what unit of measure.

00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:10.810
Some chords (crowds) seem
sad because uncertain?

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:14.590
-- while others appear
quite resolved."

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.620
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "Poetry wants

00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.070
to make things mean
more than they mean."

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.130
Most of us think, "Yes,
that's pretty profound."

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:27.230
And then, she immediately
makes fun of that, huh?

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:30.350
As if we knew how much
things meant or what unit

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:32.230
of measurement we're
talking about.

00:24:32.230 --> 00:24:33.840
Even that opening line,
if you hear it again,

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.140
you'll see how funny it is.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.450
"When the rat rests, its
brain runs the maze again.

00:24:38.450 --> 00:24:40.270
It runs backwards, and repeats.

00:24:40.270 --> 00:24:41.570
This is early music."

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:43.050
[ Laughter ]

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:44.660
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I like, I
like Bach and Vivaldi, but,

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.110
you know, that's
pretty much [inaudible].

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:47.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
that's right.

00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:50.540
That's how it began, yeah.

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.730
In another poem, you write, "The
string of words could be a worm

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:58.240
or a needle passing in
and out through some hole,

00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.150
stitching what to what?"

00:25:00.150 --> 00:25:03.580
It's like you're about to
tell us what poetry does,

00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:05.760
you're about to tell us
how words connect things

00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:09.910
and make meanings, and then
you make fun of that impulse

00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:15.150
to explain or define what poetry
does, even as you are doing it.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.610
You, the way you involve
us in that process.

00:25:17.610 --> 00:25:20.030
You remember a poem called
"Formal Constraints"?

00:25:20.030 --> 00:25:21.330
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh, yeah.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.220
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "Just Saying"

00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.870
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: "Just
Saying" [inaudible].

00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:26.170
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right there.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:30.510
Even your title is
sort of ironical.

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:36.040
[ Pages Turning ]

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:37.340
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: All right.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.640
This one's a little kinky.

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.480
"Formal Constraints.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:46.760
Now the poem is saying what it
is forced to say by its history,

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:52.150
its form thus pleasing the
reader who knows he can trust it

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:57.480
without being obliged to regard
any statements it may make

00:25:57.480 --> 00:26:00.400
as accurate or "true."

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:04.620
The poem is ridding
itself and us of the burden

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:08.280
of abstraction - a
valuable service.

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:13.090
Still a question arises
as to how to dispose

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:18.440
of the poem once this
divestment is complete."

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:25.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Explain
that poem to us, would you?

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.660
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
[laughs] Well,

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:29.020
poems often have formal
constraints of some sort.

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:34.810
So, a poem might be
forced, in certain ways.

00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.110
I don't feel that.

00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:37.410
I think I suppose mine are, too.

00:26:37.410 --> 00:26:39.680
Sure, I mean, I learned
a lot from modernism,

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:42.070
from William Carlos
Williams and such.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:47.100
I mean, poems are, you know,
have short lines and such.

00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.460
So, you know, the, whether
you're writing a sonnet

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:51.760
or you're writing a, you know,

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.960
sort of modernist slash
post-modernist poem,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:59.710
there's going to be
expectations, habits,

00:26:59.710 --> 00:27:03.020
constraints that you're
going to be obeying.

00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.710
But, I sort of took off
from the word constraints

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:08.590
because you hear,
you hear that a lot.

00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:11.150
You hear in the poetry world

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:12.480
because there could
be different kinds

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.550
of formal constraints
besides the traditional,

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:17.160
besides like a sonnet
or something.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.350
You could decide that
you're going to write,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:21.600
like Lyn Hejinian's
book "My Life".

00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:27.690
You're going to write
37 paragraphs,

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:29.900
each of which is
37 sentences long.

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:32.710
That's a self-invented
formal constraint, right?

00:27:32.710 --> 00:27:36.440
So, you hear that praise
constraints, but, you know,

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.650
it sort of made me
think about bondage.

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:41.130
And so, that made me think
about serial killers.

00:27:41.130 --> 00:27:45.430
So, there's a voice going on
behind this poem, you know,

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:47.000
like how do you dispose
of the body.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.300
It's sort of [laughter].

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:53.810
[inaudible] "Still a question
arises as to how to dispose

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:56.470
of the poem once this
divestment," which, of course,

00:27:56.470 --> 00:27:59.780
means taking your clothes
off, "is complete."

00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:04.390
So, I don't know whether
it's playful or not,

00:28:04.390 --> 00:28:09.700
but sometimes I just get a
voice in my head that's sort

00:28:09.700 --> 00:28:12.510
of the devil made me
do it, I guess, but.

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.040
[ Laughter ]

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Want
to talk about words.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:20.370
"What can words say?"

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:22.000
you ask in one poem.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.400
And, later in that same
collection, you say,

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.690
"What can description do?

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:30.480
Tongues tapping the roofs of
our mouth to make meaning."

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.940
And, that is what language
is, ultimately, biologically.

00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.240
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yep.

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.540
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:37.860
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Just tapping our
tongue to the top of our mouth.

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.810
Want you to read a
poem called "Spent".

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.110
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:44.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You can see how
much I like this collection.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.300
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "Spent".

00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:48.320
I want you to listen here
to the way the meanings

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:50.690
of words are being
flipped line by line.

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:56.850
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: This one,
by the way, also sort of came

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:02.260
out of teaching and seeing what
my student, who were young,

00:29:02.260 --> 00:29:05.910
as you point out, no longer
knew about the meaning of words

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:08.970
that I, that they would
know one meaning of a word.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:12.350
In the case of "Spent", it had
to do with, they thought it had

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.110
to do with money,
only with money.

00:29:14.110 --> 00:29:15.410
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:16.720
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Which
it doesn't necessarily.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.200
But anyway.

00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:23.120
"Spent. Suffer as in allow.

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.440
List as in want.

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.960
Listless as in transcending
desire,

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.090
or not rising to greet it.

00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:38.380
To list is to lean,
dangerously, to one side.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:40.600
Have you forgotten?

00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.410
Spent as in exhausted."

00:29:44.410 --> 00:29:48.660
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And
a poem, a poet plays

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:50.040
with all those meanings.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.740
Some meanings are
contradictory or unrelated

00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:55.110
to one another at the same time.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:59.140
And, this poem encapsulates
that in a very subconscious way.

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.170
I remember explaining
to a reporter

00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.470
at the Christian Science Monitor

00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:04.520
that we couldn't say
sucked in the monitor.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.640
He had no idea that that had
any sort of obscene meaning.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.240

become so common to him,

write "Language exists

to pull things close."

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:24.450
In another one, you write,

00:30:24.450 --> 00:30:28.730
"Pattern recognition was our
first response to loneliness."

00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:30.330

poem, you write, "The feeling

Some lines I pulled out here.

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:49.890
This one. In "With",
you say, "I write things

00:30:49.890 --> 00:30:53.200
down to show others
later or to show myself

00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.630
that I am not alone
with my experience."

00:30:56.630 --> 00:31:01.470
One of your poems ends, "So much
happiness is caged in language,

00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:05.470
ready to burst out
anytime and fade."

00:31:05.470 --> 00:31:08.380
It sounds so hopeful, and then.

00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:09.680
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
And, then, yeah.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's quite dark.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.280

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.580
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The nod, yes.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:15.920
[laughs] Let's talk about
metaphors and what those are.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.760
In a poem called
"Versed", you write,

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:20.180
"Metaphor forms a crust beneath

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:24.470
which the crevice
of each experience."

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:26.380
I love that more
than I understand it.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.250
Can you explain it?

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:29.550
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I could try.

00:31:29.550 --> 00:31:35.530
I thought that was a pretty
good explanation of it.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:42.140
[laughs] Yeah, well, I mean,
metaphor forms a crust.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.440
[laughs]

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:48.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Could
you repeat it, please?

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:50.170
[inaudible] move on.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:55.400
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I think that
a metaphor creates its own kind

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.870
of surface, and that
metaphors can be clever.

00:31:57.870 --> 00:32:02.800
Metaphor, metaphors
carry, as we all know,

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.120
something across from one sort
of realm of discourse to another

00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:10.730
and connected to like a bridge.

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.960
Typically, you start to write

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:16.340
because you've had
some experience,

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.480
and the experience may be
just a thought or a feeling.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.780
I don't mean something happened

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:22.570
to you necessarily,
but it may have.

00:32:22.570 --> 00:32:28.380
And, that experience
starts you to want to write,

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.280
and perhaps you come
up with this metaphor.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.370
And, the metaphor is
like a little machine.

00:32:33.370 --> 00:32:36.500
And, it connects these two
things, one to the other.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.400
But, once you've got
this bridge, you know,

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.000
the bridge kind of goes over
the experience, I guess,

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.480
meaning the experience is
still there inside you.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.770
It doesn't stop being
there inside you,

00:32:47.770 --> 00:32:49.980
and you never plumbed it all.

00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:52.300
I mean, have you?

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:53.680
So.

00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:54.980
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's good.

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.280
That's very good.

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:57.580
Thank you very much.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.300
I want you to read a poem
called "Integer" in "Versed".

00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:04.060
This is the book for which you
won the Pulitzer Prize, right?

00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:06.370

second part.

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:10.410
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Just
read the second part?

00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:16.400
Okay. "Metaphor is
ritual sacrifice.

00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.720
It kills the look-alike.

00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:21.370
No, metaphor is homeopathy.

contact inhibition."

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:29.350

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:30.650
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:34.100
"Metaphor is ritual sacrifice.

No, metaphor is homeopathy.

contact inhibition."

00:33:44.290 --> 00:33:49.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You gave us two
definitions of metaphor there.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.040
You give one of them.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.560
You immediately contradict it.

00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.530
Homeopathy is not a word
we use very much anymore.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:59.080
It used to be you would
give someone a poison

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.840
in a very diluted
amount that would induce,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.140
in a healthy person,

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:04.500
the conditions they're
suffering from.

00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:05.800
And that was.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.100
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Or, so they say.

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And,
that was thought

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.700
to cure them in some way.

00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:11.000
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.300
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:13.600
Those two definitions, why those
two definitions of metaphor?

00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:15.950
What do you suggesting?

00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:20.650
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I,
I can explain the first one.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:22.840

explain the you homeopathy.

But, "Metaphor is
ritual sacrifice.

It kills the look-alike."

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:31.890
Well, I think in metaphor,
there's always one term,

00:34:31.890 --> 00:34:34.490
or usually, there's one
term that's privileged

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:38.100
over the other, you know.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:42.260
And, what the thing is like
usually gets developed further

00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:44.430
than the thing, right?

00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:53.050
So, it's like the thing,
the tenor of the metaphor

00:34:53.050 --> 00:34:56.430
which is the sort of
technical, literary term.

00:34:56.430 --> 00:35:00.110
The thing you're really
talking about gets subsumed

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:02.230
by the vehicle of the metaphor

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.940
which is the way
you're describing it.

00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.950
That takes over.

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:10.000

the original.

00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:16.290
a healthy cell exhibits
contact inhibition.

00:35:16.290 --> 00:35:19.750
That has a specific meaning.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:23.390
You know what kind of cells
don't exhibit contact inhibition

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.020
and continue to grow
into other cells?

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:28.310
Cancer cells.

00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:31.550
So, I guess the whole
thing is sort of playing

00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:34.240
around with metaphor as cancer.

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.390
And then, homeopathy's
a kind of medicine,

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:39.030
so that makes a kind
of sense with it.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.330

attitude about religion is

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.860
that on the one hand, at least
the kind of religion that I grew

00:42:45.860 --> 00:42:49.810
up with, I grew up with praying.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:55.890
And so, sometimes, if I really
feel threatened or something,

00:42:55.890 --> 00:43:00.750
I still have a tendency to want
to say a prayer, but then, I,

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.560
I mean, it seems to creepy to be

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:07.570
like asking a personal
favor of a Lord.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.480
I'm sorry if some of you are no
doubt religious, but it's just

00:43:10.480 --> 00:43:13.280
so feudal, like feudalistic,
you know.

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.580
Lord, let me.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:19.310
And, the whole language, the
whole construction of it is

00:43:19.310 --> 00:43:24.210
so hierarchical, right,
and authoritarian.

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.500
And, that put me off.

00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.830
And, maybe it was an
anti-patriarchal feeling

00:43:31.830 --> 00:43:36.610
that had that the whole sort
of feudal court patriarchy

00:43:36.610 --> 00:43:41.090
of religion as I was
introduced to it put me off.

00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:46.480
But, having said that,
there's still, I guess,

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.310
a sense of reaching inside me

00:43:49.310 --> 00:43:51.200
that doesn't know what
it's reaching for.

00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.500
But, it's reaching.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.350
I think there's something,
sort of,

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:57.720
excessive about human
consciousness.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.200
It's more than we need to
survive, you know, this,

00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:03.620
the sense of beauty, right?

00:44:03.620 --> 00:44:10.380
The sense of kind of the
whole self-consciousness thing

00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.840
which is so extreme with humans,

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.410
is more than we need,
really, to survive.

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.470
So, what's that for, you know?

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:18.880
I'm not saying, necessarily

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.300
that because it exists,
God must exist.

00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.300
I'm just saying that
because it exists,

00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:27.500
we reach out to something
that must be beyond us

00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:32.740
or that we wish were beyond us
because we have all of this sort

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:34.470
of extra consciousness
to play with.

00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:38.190
You know, to look at
the universe with.

00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.690
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: The brain
is bigger than the sky.

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.990
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.290
Yeah.

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:43.590
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:44:43.590 --> 00:44:44.890
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: There we go.

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:46.190
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, yeah.

00:44:46.190 --> 00:44:47.490
You write in one
poem, "Like God,

00:44:47.490 --> 00:44:48.790
I will leave an arc
of implication."

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:50.240
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: [laughter]
Oh, that poem is, yeah.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.910
I'm "Mother's Day".

00:44:51.910 --> 00:44:53.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:44:53.210 --> 00:44:55.030
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah, I
sort of play God in that poem.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.040
[ Laughter ]

00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.060
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's such a good
comment on the speaker and God,

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:01.600
"an arc of implication".

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.240
In "Solution", you write,
"You're the thing that waits

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:07.090
to trap each passing thought,

00:45:07.090 --> 00:45:10.140
the anxious blank
that God loves."

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:13.980
And then, a poem
called "Prayer".

00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:15.280
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:18.020
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In a
collection called "Money Shot".

00:45:18.020 --> 00:45:19.320
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right.

00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.620
[laughs]

00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:22.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: A
surprisingly crude reference.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.460
Where? Why can't I find it?

00:45:24.460 --> 00:45:25.760
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, I wrote

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.860
"Money Shot" pretty much
during the financial crisis.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:29.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Okay, so
it does not refer to the?

00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.740
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well,
I was certainly aware

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:38.420
of the porn reference, but you
know, the money thought in porn,

00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.570
as everyone knows, I guess,
is where the man proves

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.320
that he's enjoyed himself.

00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.420
So, it's about, you know, like,
show me the money, I guess,

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:52.080
in the sense, you know, the
moment of truth, so to speak.

00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Prayer.

00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:56.830
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Prayer.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:59.040
Prayers, actually plural.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.230
"We pray and the
resurrection happens.

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:07.980
Here are the young again,
sniping and giggling,

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:11.450
tingly as ringing phones.

00:46:11.450 --> 00:46:16.220
All we ask is that our
thinking sustain momentum,

00:46:16.220 --> 00:46:18.580
identify targets.

00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:25.260
The pressure in my lower back
rising to be recognized as pain.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:29.780
The blue triangles
on the rug repeating.

00:46:29.780 --> 00:46:35.020
Coming up, a discussion
on the uses of torture.

00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:38.750
The fear that all this will end.

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:41.470
The fear that it won't."

00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:53.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I have felt
like that often this year.

00:46:53.720 --> 00:46:59.560
[laughs] Shifting gears, in
a way, are a number of poems

00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.440
that have to do with physics.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.740
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:04.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And,
astrophysics.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:05.340
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right.

00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:06.710
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: In a way that
sometimes becomes anthological

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:08.910
and theological, but
sometimes it's very

00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:10.490
surprisingly technical.

00:47:10.490 --> 00:47:12.410
Where did that come from?

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:13.710
Did you study physics?

00:47:13.710 --> 00:47:15.580
Did you study astrophysics?

00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:16.880
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Not in school.

00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.180
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Astronomy?

00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:19.750
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Well, so, there's a lot

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.050
to be said about that.

00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:25.560
First of all, I think that I got
interested in physics because,

00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:28.560
and cosmology because
it asks some

00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:30.970
of the same questions
that religion asks.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:35.520
You know. How did
the universe begin?

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.230
How will the universe end?

00:47:40.230 --> 00:47:41.980
You know, why is
the universe here,

00:47:41.980 --> 00:47:46.570
although it doesn't really
answer that question, but so,

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:49.570
I think that's where I got
interested in physics is

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:52.390
because it asks those
really big questions.

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:58.700
And, yeah, I started reading
those popular physics books

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:00.410
for lay people.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:02.330
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Like "The
Cosmos" and that sort of thing?

00:48:02.330 --> 00:48:03.630
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.980
I mean, you know, Brian
Greene's "The Elegant Universes"

00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:09.570
and "The Fabric of the Cosmos",
and not just Brian Greene.

00:48:09.570 --> 00:48:16.340
But, you know, Lee Smolin and
Lisa Randall and Carlo Rovelli.

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:18.130
And so, I've read a
lot of those books.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:19.430
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:48:19.430 --> 00:48:22.970
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: And, so, I
picked up some of the lingo,

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.950
and I think I know
something about it,

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:27.300
but I certainly not an expert.

00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.400
I mean, to really know physics,
you have to understand the math

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:31.700
because physics is math.

00:48:31.700 --> 00:48:33.000
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.440
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: So,
basically, when you read one

00:48:34.440 --> 00:48:36.420
of those books, and
you're not doing the math,

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.770
you're reading metaphors.

00:48:37.770 --> 00:48:40.040
I mean, you know,
physicists are trying

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.280
to tell you what they've found
out by various metaphors.

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.580
And, some of them are.

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:46.880
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Actually
[inaudible].

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:48.180
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Some
of them are good, yeah.

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:49.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:50.780
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Exactly.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:52.080
And, some of them are good
at creating metaphors.

00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.380
Some of better than others.

00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:55.570
But, you know, you're
getting a kind

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.580
of a metaphorical top layer
beneath which is really math.

00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:02.930
And, I can't get to the math,
but I'm very interested in it.

00:49:02.930 --> 00:49:07.990
I, but, also, I read it
because it provokes me to write,

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:11.260
and it provokes me to write
because I get to a place

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.710
that I don't understand.

00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:14.560
And, that's, that sense

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.450
of puzzlement is often
what starts a poem

00:49:17.450 --> 00:49:21.870
for me whether the poem's
about physics or theology

00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:24.430
or even popular culture.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.050
Like, why is that popular?

00:49:26.050 --> 00:49:31.110
You know, anything that leaves
me not quite understanding can

00:49:31.110 --> 00:49:32.640
lead into a poem somehow.

00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:35.420
And, since that happens so
often with physics books.

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:36.720
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.870
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: And, once
I found out that I could end

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.790
up writing a poem by reading
a physics book, I went,

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:43.520
"I'll read more physics."

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:44.820
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:46.120
It's very surprising to me.

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:51.600
Do you have a favorite here a
"Scale", "A Human", "Simple"?

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:53.350
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay,
well "Simple" is more

00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:56.570
about biology, really, but yeah.

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:59.850
Well, why don't, could we do
two, or can we just do one?

00:49:59.850 --> 00:50:01.150
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Oh, sure.

00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:02.450
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:06.940
Well, let's do, let's do
"Simple" and maybe "Scale".

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:12.860
Sure. "Simple" is in "Versed".

00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:17.560
Okay. And, this is dedicated

00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.170
to my son Aaron Korkegian
who's a biologist.

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:26.550
So, this is, we were, I guess
we were talking about evolution,

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:29.930
and he thought that I was
anthropomorphizing it.

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.680
And, I didn't mean to, but
that's language for you.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:38.800
You know, when you, it's hard
to talk about processes without,

00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:41.290
dynamic processes
without speaking

00:50:41.290 --> 00:50:43.870
as if there were agents
behind them somehow.

00:50:43.870 --> 00:50:45.170
So, anyway.

00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:46.470
Here's the poem.

00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:47.880
Oh, and also, this is,
well, we haven't talk

00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:52.070
about that, so I won't go into.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:57.930
"Simple. Complex systems
can arise from simple rules.

00:50:57.930 --> 00:51:01.580
It's not that we
want to survive,

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:05.270
it's that we've been
drugged and made to act

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:11.040
as if we do while all
the while the sea breaks

00:51:11.040 --> 00:51:15.140
and rolls, painlessly, under.

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:19.280
If we're not copying
it, we're lonely.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:24.590
Is this the knowledge that
demands to be passed down?

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:29.900
Time is made from swatches
of heaven and hell.

00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:33.470
If we're not killing
it, we're hungry."

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.770
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Nice.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:41.290
Now, that opening line
is, refers to, like,

00:51:41.290 --> 00:51:44.360
how could we have eyeballs or.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:45.660
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Livers or
complicated physical things

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.570
which started from very
simple systems, right?

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:50.870
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:52.480
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's the sort of
biological premise of evolution.

00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:53.780
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Right.

00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:55.080
Right. Right.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:56.380
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Getting at here.

00:51:56.380 --> 00:51:57.680
Right. But, you take this
in a different direction.

00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.270
Talk about the direction
you take that.

00:52:01.830 --> 00:52:03.130
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, okay.

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:06.660
So, this whole book,
not the whole book.

00:52:06.660 --> 00:52:07.960
I'm sorry.

00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:09.260
Like half the book.

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:11.360
Half the book was
written in the wake

00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.920
of my being diagnosed
with cancer.

00:52:13.920 --> 00:52:16.500
And, not just any cancer,
not a common cancer.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.260
No, a cancer no one
had ever heard of.

00:52:18.260 --> 00:52:22.140
I mean, someone had, but
adrenocortical cancer

00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:25.910
which is vanishingly rare
and also super deadly.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.920
And so, like, almost
no one survives.

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.340
So, I did, though.

00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:31.640
But.

00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:33.870
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That's great.

00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:35.640
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: It's
great, but of course,

00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:38.800
I didn't think I was going
to because, you know,

00:52:38.800 --> 00:52:41.370
when I read about
it, was like, um.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:43.670
A 5% maybe survive.

00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:47.140
So, I, you know, basically, I
was getting my affairs in order.

00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.010
Even though they got
the whole tumor out,

00:52:49.010 --> 00:52:51.950
and they didn't see anymore
cancer, but the doctors I talked

00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:56.510
to went, "Well, we see no
evidence of disease now."

00:52:56.510 --> 00:52:59.720
[ Laughter ]

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:01.020
But, you know, I
was just waiting

00:53:01.020 --> 00:53:02.420
for it to come back, right?

00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:07.370
So, I wrote this book, or half
of this book in, you know,

00:53:07.370 --> 00:53:11.470
even for a while after
that, I sort of wrote kind

00:53:11.470 --> 00:53:17.520
of under the idea that
I was going to die.

00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:21.670
So, I was, in a way,
talking about just sort

00:53:21.670 --> 00:53:24.260
of the cruelty of
life, I suppose.

00:53:24.260 --> 00:53:26.510
"It's not that we
want to survive,

00:53:26.510 --> 00:53:30.040
it's that we've been drugged
and made to act as if we do."

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:35.900
Well, I mean, that's a sort of.

00:53:40.310 --> 00:53:41.980
Is that true?

00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.290
Maybe it's true.

00:53:43.290 --> 00:53:47.710
If you think of the sort
of biochemicals in our body

00:53:47.710 --> 00:53:51.900
as drugs, you know, that
we have a reward system.

00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:55.830
And, one of the things we're
rewarded for by our dopamine

00:53:55.830 --> 00:54:00.610
and our serotonin is doing
things that help our survival.

00:54:00.610 --> 00:54:01.910
Right?

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:03.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:54:03.210 --> 00:54:05.700
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Eating, etc.
So, in a way, you could say

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:09.320
that we're drugged and made to
act as if we wanted to survive.

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.830
It's not that we wake up
from childhood and we're two,

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.350
and we go, "You know
what I want?

00:54:14.350 --> 00:54:15.650
I want to survive."

00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:19.630
It's not like we really have a
choice about wanting to survive.

00:54:19.630 --> 00:54:22.250
That was foisted on us.

00:54:22.250 --> 00:54:25.630
So, the poem kind of
goes on from there.

00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:27.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:31.600
Let's read one of the more
physics-oriented poems.

00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.900
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:54:32.900 --> 00:54:34.200
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Would
that be "Scale"?

00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:35.500
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: "Scale".

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:36.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Or "Conclusion"?

00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:38.100
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Let's go, okay,

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.400
is "Conclusion" in "Itself"?

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:40.700
Let's see.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.000
Let me look at it.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.300
Yes! It's kind of, yeah.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I like the way
it becomes very theological

00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:45.900
by the end.

00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:47.200
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Oh, right.

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.500
Right. Right.

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:49.800
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Begins
with physics.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:51.100
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Talk
about both of them.

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:52.400
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Begins with
physics, ends with God.

00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.700
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah, it's
starts with cosmology, I guess,

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:57.310
and the man I'm referring
to is Stephen Hawking here.

00:54:57.310 --> 00:54:58.610
"Conclusion.

00:54:58.610 --> 00:55:02.850
A man is upset for many
years because he's heard

00:55:02.850 --> 00:55:07.520
that information is
destroyed in a black hole.

00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:12.660
Question: what does this
man mean by "information"?

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.500
The example given is
of a cry for help,

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.370
but this is accompanied by
the image of a toy space ship,

00:55:21.370 --> 00:55:27.130
upended, and is thus not
to be taken seriously.

00:55:27.130 --> 00:55:31.590
The man recovers his peace of
mind when he ceases to believe

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:35.810
in passing through, when
he becomes convinced

00:55:35.810 --> 00:55:41.660
that the lost information is
splattered on the event horizon.

00:55:41.660 --> 00:55:45.670
The detective is the new mime.

00:55:45.670 --> 00:55:50.110
She acts out understanding
the way a mime climbs an

00:55:50.110 --> 00:55:52.740
invisible wall.

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:57.710
It's because our senses
are so poor that, on CSI,

00:55:57.710 --> 00:56:01.250
the investigators
stand stock-still,

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:06.470
boulders in a stream, while
a crowd pours around them.

00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:11.540
They pan in slow motion,
reminding us of cameras,

00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:15.040
then focus with inhuman clarity

00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:18.660
on the pattern of
cracks in a wall.

00:56:18.660 --> 00:56:22.850
God's fractal stammer
pleasures us again."

00:56:22.850 --> 00:56:27.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is
a whiplash of a poem.

00:56:27.120 --> 00:56:29.230
[ Laughter ]

00:56:29.230 --> 00:56:32.060
I mean, I does, it goes all,

00:56:32.060 --> 00:56:33.980
it goes all over the
universe, literally.

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:36.100
It's always about
information, though.

00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.400
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.700
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Turning
that turn.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.000
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I
guess you're right.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.300
Yeah.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.600
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: If you
understand, I mean,

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:43.900
and I only have the
most basic understanding

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.200
of what physicists
mean by information.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:47.730
But, then, you're playing with
pop culture in this TV show,

00:56:47.730 --> 00:56:49.030
and their information.

00:56:49.030 --> 00:56:50.330
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.630
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's a very
different kind of information.

00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:52.930
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Yeah, the detectives.

00:56:52.930 --> 00:56:56.210
Right. Detectives on TV, and you
know, I think this was probably.

00:56:56.210 --> 00:56:59.210
I don't really watch CSI,
but I must have seen,

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:01.050
you know, a preview for it.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:05.790
I saw, I'm sure I saw this
image where it must have gone

00:57:05.790 --> 00:57:07.450
into slo-mo, you know.

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:11.690
And, the investigator
was, you know, panning,

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:15.510
reminding us of cameras.

00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:17.830
Then focus with an
inhuman clarity.

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.210
But, this is kind of a
Sherlock Holmes moment, right,

00:57:20.210 --> 00:57:24.330
of being able to
see the pattern.

00:57:24.330 --> 00:57:25.630
And, yeah, right.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:27.770
And, then, you, were you going
to say something about the end?

00:57:27.770 --> 00:57:30.120
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: You say
something about the end.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:33.710
I think it's gorgeous
and baffling.

00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:35.400
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
God's fractal.

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:37.070
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: I mean,
someone's going to use

00:57:37.070 --> 00:57:38.480
that as a title for
a book someday,

00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:39.780
you know, "God's fractal".

00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:42.370
It's just great.

00:57:42.370 --> 00:57:46.370
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah,
well, you know, fractals are,

00:57:46.370 --> 00:57:50.690
some of you may know,
sort of recursive,

00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:52.640
repeating patterns in nature.

00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:53.940
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Every
more complex.

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:55.240
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.270
Right. And, we enjoy them.

00:57:58.270 --> 00:58:02.550
I mean, when you see something
that is a fractal pattern,

00:58:02.550 --> 00:58:06.180
you're going to find it pretty.

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:09.880
You know, I think
that's just human nature.

00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:15.630
So, I guess, it sounds,
in the poem,

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:18.810
like this is a trick God's
playing on us, or worse,

00:58:18.810 --> 00:58:20.540
that God's fumbling at our soul.

00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:21.840
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yes.

00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:23.240
Yeah, well, it sounds
like He's in charge.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:24.540
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Something else.

00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:25.840
You know.

00:58:25.840 --> 00:58:27.140
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah.

00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.440
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: He might
have his hand somewhere else.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:29.740
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Right.

00:58:29.740 --> 00:58:31.040
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
[inaudible] again.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.340
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We're
God's fractals, in a way.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:33.640
The ever, you know, ever
multiplying complexity

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.410
of our own lives and
our own thoughts.

00:58:35.410 --> 00:58:36.710
Right.

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.010
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Thoughts.

00:58:38.010 --> 00:58:39.310
Yeah.

00:58:39.310 --> 00:58:40.610
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: "Arrangements".

00:58:40.610 --> 00:58:41.910
One more poem here.

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:43.210
Nineteen. Is that in that book?

00:58:43.210 --> 00:58:44.510
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: I forgot.

00:58:44.510 --> 00:58:45.810
You know more than
I do about this.

00:58:45.810 --> 00:58:47.130
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Where's 19.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:48.580
It's in "Next Life".

00:58:48.580 --> 00:58:49.880
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:52.850
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: There we go.

00:58:52.850 --> 00:58:54.760
"Arrangements".

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.160
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

00:58:56.160 --> 00:59:00.240
Oh, yeah. This is not one
I think about very often.

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:01.800
"Arrangement.

00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.260
The way the ancient
explosion has arranged itself.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:11.420
At the bus stop: a hunched
woman with sparse auburn hair

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:17.890
above a Peter Pan collar,
a blue jumper, Mary Janes.

00:59:17.890 --> 00:59:21.290
What novelty has
always promised,

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:29.970
claiming to first coalesce,
make cleave unto is almost

00:59:29.970 --> 00:59:34.100
as last scattering surface,

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:38.130
variation in air
pressure, angel voices."

00:59:38.130 --> 00:59:44.310
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: That is a poem
that begins with the Big Bang.

00:59:44.310 --> 00:59:45.610
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

00:59:45.610 --> 00:59:46.910
It does.

00:59:46.910 --> 00:59:48.210
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: And,
immediately moves to a bus stop

00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:50.060
which is a big, big jump.

00:59:50.060 --> 00:59:51.960
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Well, the
way the ancient explosion has

00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:53.510
arranged itself.

00:59:53.510 --> 00:59:54.810
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: We are that.

00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:56.110
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: We're that.

00:59:56.110 --> 00:59:57.410
And so, what are we?

00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:59.390
So, with anything you're seeing
is the way the ancient explosion

00:59:59.390 --> 01:00:00.690
has arranged itself.

01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:03.510
It's this room right
here, or at the time

01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:06.230
that I was writing this, that's
what I looked out and saw.

01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:10.200
I guess I was probably in a
car when I had that impression

01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:13.740
of seeing a woman at a bus stop.

01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.060
And, thinking, "Hmm."

01:00:15.060 --> 01:00:19.010
Well, there's something touching
about her, something poignant

01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:20.310
that made me remember her.

01:00:20.310 --> 01:00:23.630
And, I just thought, "Well,
that's, that's one thing

01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:27.430
that the Big Bang has arranged
is this moment with her in it.

01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:30.900
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: Yeah,
it, it's very,

01:00:30.900 --> 01:00:36.110
it's a very theological moment
to be reminded that everything,

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:40.320
even the most pedestrian
moments are arrangements

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:44.800
of that ancient,
incomprehensible explosion.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:46.640
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: It's
theological if you think

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:51.150
that God ordered up the Big
Bang, but we don't know that.

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:52.450
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: So,
it's cosmological.

01:00:52.450 --> 01:00:53.750
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout:
Or, I don't know that.

01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.050
Maybe you know that.

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:56.350
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: No,
it's cosmological.

01:00:56.350 --> 01:00:57.650
It's anthological or something.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:58.950
Yeah, it makes us, it makes our
ordinary lives seem suddenly

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:00.320
much vaster.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.620
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:02.920
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: To
attach it back to that.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.870
I want to end with a poem
that has nothing to do

01:01:05.870 --> 01:01:09.320
with anything we've
talked about.

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.790
Which made me laugh.

01:01:11.790 --> 01:01:13.810
Called "Traveling
Through the Yard".

01:01:13.810 --> 01:01:15.110
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Okay.

01:01:15.110 --> 01:01:16.500
[ Laughter ]

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:18.080
Yeah. That's a parody.

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.040
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: It's
an early book.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.340
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Yeah.

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:30.840
Okay. Well, this does a
version of a famous poem called

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.690
"Traveling Through the Dark".

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:36.430
That poem, you probably know
it, is by William Stafford.

01:01:36.430 --> 01:01:41.170
So, this is "Traveling Through
the Yard from William Stafford".

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:46.690
"It was lying near my back porch
in the gaudy light of morning -

01:01:46.690 --> 01:01:52.130
a dove corpse, oddly
featherless, alive with flies.

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:55.260
I stopped, dustpan in hand,

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.150
and heard them purr
over their feast.

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.910
To leave that there
would make some stink!

01:02:02.910 --> 01:02:06.910
So, thinking hard for all
of us, I scooped it up,

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:10.040
heaved it across the
marriage counselor's fence."

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:12.060
[ Laughter ]

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.360
&gt;&gt; Ron Charles: All right.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:15.110
[ Laughter ]

01:02:15.110 --> 01:02:16.860
It's been such a pleasure
to talk to you tonight.

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:19.310
Thank you so much.

01:02:19.310 --> 01:02:21.610
[ Applause ]

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:22.960
&gt;&gt; Rae Armantrout: Thank you.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:26.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
