00:00:00.604 --> 00:00:02.343
- [Voiceover] The following
tables lists the values

00:00:02.343 --> 00:00:04.889
of functions f and h,
and of their derivatives,

00:00:04.889 --> 00:00:07.771
f prime and h prime for
x is equal to three.

00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.604
So all this is telling us,

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:09.437
with x is equal to three,

00:00:09.437 --> 00:00:12.362
the value of the function
is six, f of three is six,

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.449
you could view it that way.

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:16.963
h of three is zero, f
prime of three is six,

00:00:16.963 --> 00:00:19.313
and h prime of three is four.

00:00:19.313 --> 00:00:20.818
And now they want us to
evaluate the derivative

00:00:20.818 --> 00:00:25.270
with respect to x of the
product of f of x and h of x

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.165
when x is equal to three.

00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:28.818
One way you could view this is,

00:00:28.818 --> 00:00:31.459
if we viewed some function,

00:00:31.459 --> 00:00:34.308
if we viewed some function g of x.

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:38.439
g of x as being equal
to the product of f of x

00:00:38.439 --> 00:00:39.356
and h of x,

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.945
this expression is the
derivative of g of x.

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.112
So we could write g prime of
x is equal to the derivative

00:00:48.057 --> 00:00:50.060
with respect to x

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.893
of f of x

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.401
times h of x.

00:00:55.487 --> 00:00:56.989
Which is what we see right here,

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.480
and which is what we want to
evaluate at x equals three.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.763
So we essentially want to evaluate

00:01:00.763 --> 00:01:01.596
g prime

00:01:02.761 --> 00:01:04.102
of three.

00:01:04.102 --> 00:01:06.320
This is what they're asking us to do.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.949
Well, to do that, let's go first up here.

00:01:08.949 --> 00:01:09.956
Let's just think about what this is doing.

00:01:09.956 --> 00:01:11.153
They're asking us to take the derivative

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:13.436
with respect to x of the
product of two functions

00:01:13.436 --> 00:01:15.444
that we have some information about.

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:17.320
Well, if we're taking the
derivative of the product

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.691
of two functions, you
could imagine that the

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.376
product rule could prove useful here.

00:01:21.376 --> 00:01:23.243
So I'm just gonna
restate the product rule.

00:01:23.243 --> 00:01:25.032
This is going to be
equal to the derivative

00:01:25.032 --> 00:01:26.562
of the first function,

00:01:26.562 --> 00:01:27.645
f prime of x,

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:32.674
times the second function,
not taking its derivative.

00:01:32.674 --> 00:01:35.535
Plus the first function,
not taking its derivative,

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:38.773
f of x, times the derivative
of the second function,

00:01:38.773 --> 00:01:39.856
h prime of x.

00:01:40.734 --> 00:01:43.022
So if you're trying to
find g prime of three,

00:01:43.022 --> 00:01:44.747
well that's just going to be

00:01:44.747 --> 00:01:47.497
f prime of three times h of three

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:50.564
plus f of three

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:53.952
times h prime of three.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.412
And lucky for us, they give
us what all these things

00:01:57.412 --> 00:01:58.412
evaluate to.

00:01:59.407 --> 00:02:03.008
f prime of three, right
over here, they tell us.

00:02:03.008 --> 00:02:07.091
f prime when x is equal
to three is equal to six.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.414
So this right over here is six.

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.368
h of three, they give us that, too.

00:02:14.368 --> 00:02:17.782
h of three, when x is
three, the value of our

00:02:17.782 --> 00:02:19.997
function is zero.

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:21.903
So this is zero.

00:02:21.903 --> 00:02:24.451
So this first term is you
just get six times zero,

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:26.918
which is gonna be zero,
but we'll get to that.

00:02:26.918 --> 00:02:28.168
Now f of three.

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:30.364
f of three.

00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:34.006
Well, the function when
x is equal to three,

00:02:34.006 --> 00:02:36.256
f of three is equal to six.

00:02:38.044 --> 00:02:39.867
So that is six.

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:41.335
And then finally,

00:02:41.335 --> 00:02:44.052
h prime evaluated at three,

00:02:44.052 --> 00:02:46.690
h prime of x when x is equal to three,

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.562
h prime of x is equal to four.

00:02:48.562 --> 00:02:52.121
Or you could say this is h prime of three.

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:53.454
So this is four.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:56.148
And so there you have it.

00:02:56.148 --> 00:02:58.325
This is going to evaluate
to six times zero,

00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:00.790
which, that's all just gonna be zero,

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.059
plus six times four,

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:05.968
which is going to be equal to 24.

00:03:05.968 --> 00:03:07.218
And we're done.
