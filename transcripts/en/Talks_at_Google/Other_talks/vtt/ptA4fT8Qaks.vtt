RICHARD GINGRAS: Welcome
to Authors at Google.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.600
I'm Richard Gingras,
and today we're

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.404
here with Yukari Itawani Kane.

00:00:12.404 --> 00:00:13.820
YUKARI IWATANI
KANE: Iwatani Kane.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.860
RICHARD GINGRAS: Iwatani Kane.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.605
I read it wrong.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:17.890
I have a typo.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.870
Who's talking to us here today
about her recently published

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.447
book, "Haunted Empire,
Apple after Steve Jobs."

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:28.030
I think probably all
of us would agree

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.510
that probably the most
fascinating question

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.260
in the world of tech
the last couple of years

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.870
is indeed just that,
is how will Apple

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.070
survive the death of
its legendary founder.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:40.534
But I'm sure everyone
in this room,

00:00:40.534 --> 00:00:42.200
after just a couple
of minutes' thought,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.920
can come up with a very
thoughtful and glib answer

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.390
to that question.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.790
But Yukari here actually,
you spent almost two years

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.152
looking at this question, and
I thank you for doing that.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.360
But let me first give you
a little bit of background,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.320
and then we'll get
into the discussion.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.710
Yukari has been writing about
the tech industry for over 15

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:02.580
years.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.470
And as a reporter for the
"Wall Street Journal,"

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.490
she covered Apple
during the last years

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.470
of Steve Jobs' reign.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.850
Kane is best known for
her in depth analysis

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.540
and scoops, among which include
the news about Steve Jobs'

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.900
top secret liver transplant,
the launch of the initial iPad,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.650
the launch of the
iPhone on Verizon.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.620
Her stories have often included
the off beat as well as

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.820
the hilarious-- a fun piece
on a 15-year-old iPhone

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.280
hacker and a story
on iPad couture that

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.150
became the subject of a
fabulous Steven Colbert rant.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.840
You can still find it
on YouTube somewhere.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.040
In 2011, she was named
as the Gerald Loeb Award

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.820
finalist as part of a
WSJ team for a series

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.080
on internet privacy.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.610
Among her peers, she
developed a reputation

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.300
as the recipient of
controlled leaks from Apple--

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.310
and we may talk
about that-- even

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.940
becoming the
subject of a segment

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.960
on NPR's "On the Media."

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.610
According to Yukari, the
truth is considerably less

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.430
interesting.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.320
All of her scoops
and stories came

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.660
from painstaking
reporting and vetting.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.800
So I'd like to actually
start by going back

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.510
to the basics with you
and your career, which

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.386
is, what caused you to become a
journalist in the first place?

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.500
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
It's interesting

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.020
because I grew up in the '80s,
and I'm originally from Japan.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.590
And I moved back and forth
between the US and Japan

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.750
because of my dad's job.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.800
And the '80s was when
there was a lot of tension

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.840
between the two countries,
if you remember,

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.370
with the automobile
industry and et cetera.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.525
And I just saw a lot
of miscommunication

00:02:48.525 --> 00:02:50.710
and misunderstanding going on.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.360
And I thought to
myself, well, I could

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.660
help explain things
to each other.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.879
And that's what peaked my
initial interest in journalism.

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.420
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
given that you've

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.253
been doing this for a
while, and you've just

00:03:08.253 --> 00:03:10.176
completed this book,
I think one thing that

00:03:10.176 --> 00:03:12.050
would be interesting to
explore before we get

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.880
into the actual substance
of it is a bit more

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.710
of behind the scenes
how you do these things.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.990
So if you could kind of
give us just a little bit

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.390
of a window on the
process you went through

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.000
in producing the book.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.040
And I'd even start at the very
beginning, in the sense of,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.610
what was your thesis
going in, and how close

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.576
was the end result
to that thesis?

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:42.450
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Well, my thesis going in

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.590
was completely different.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.170
I covered Apple during
Steve's last three years.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.920
And if you remember,
it also coincided

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.460
with this really strong
period of growth at Apple.

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.980
They were pulling in triple
digit profits and revenue

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:57.680
growth.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.490
And I wanted to tell
the story of how Apple

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.580
went from bankruptcy
to the success

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.660
that it became-- near
bankruptcy to the success,

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.720
focusing not on
Steve, but on the team

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.380
and how it actually
really came together,

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.110
rather than the myth of
Steve having done everything.

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:17.399
And that was the
book that I proposed

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:20.310
and sold and began working on.

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.640
And a year into the
process, I realized

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.424
that history is not as relevant
and interesting anymore,

00:04:30.424 --> 00:04:31.840
and that what
everybody really was

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.730
interested in was what was
going on now without Steve,

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:41.520
and how Apple was going to
deal with this transition.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.450
And that the question
was interesting

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.700
from not just Apple's story,
but from a much broader

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.280
perspective.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.440
Because the story
is actually really

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.950
about what happens to an empire
when it loses its emperor.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:02.740
And it's a story that you
see in governments as well

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.670
as companies and in
different situations.

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:07.330
And this was
happening in business,

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.330
and it was happening
right under my nose.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.520
And I had a chance
to have a front seat

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.950
and be witness to it.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:22.600
And so I did a complete shift
and started from scratch.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.610
Not really from scratch
because by that time,

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.060
I had done a ton of interviews
about how Apple rebuilt itself.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:32.330
And so that ended up
being a really good basis

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.010
to figure out what was changing.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.240
Because of course,
you can't really

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.150
understand what's changing until
you understand how things were.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.040
But one of the first
things I did was I

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.980
booked a three-week
trip to Asia.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.060
Because so much
of Apple's success

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.810
had to do with its operations
and the supply chain in Asia,

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.310
and so much of the
growth that was coming

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.050
was from Asia as well.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.850
And I wanted to
see it for myself.

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.440
And John Ryan, who's sitting
there, was my host in Taiwan

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.030
at the time, where I
spent about 10 days.

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.190
A lot of the suppliers
are headquartered there,

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.160
so the factory
workers are in China,

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.090
but the suppliers and the
management is in Taiwan.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:21.640
And you get a really
great sense of what

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.100
the strategy and the thinking
is and how things have changed.

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:32.600
But I tend to favor
face-to-face meetings

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:35.601
and talking to people who
know pieces of information

00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:36.100
firsthand.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.310
It's how I got my
scoops at the "Journal."

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.440
I think you don't have
to get the guy that

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.680
knows everything
about everything.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.610
You just need to get the
guy who knows a little bit

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.267
about something, but
knows it firsthand.

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:55.100
And then you talk to
enough of those people,

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.110
and you piece it together,
and you get a picture.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.330
And so I talked to
almost 200 people.

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:08.620
I also don't trust
anybody else as much

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:10.370
as I trust myself
and my own judgment.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.870
So wherever I can see things
for myself, I like to go there.

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:21.760
So I went to Europe to talk to
a lot of Jonathan Ive's designer

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:25.280
friends and colleagues
from the past.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.840
I went to China, went
to the factory gates

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.820
at Foxconn at Shenzhen, spent
some time talking to a factory

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:32.455
worker that I still
keep in touch with.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:40.540
I also talked to others through
the Twitter-like messaging

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:41.510
and things like that.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.490
But I like to meet
them whenever I can.

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.280
The other thing that I did was
I went to Robertsdale, Alabama,

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.670
where Tim Cook is from,
to really understand

00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:52.420
his background.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:55.950
Because he is such a private
and mysterious person.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:00.260
And so I wanted to
understand it for myself.

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:03.160
I grew up in the East
Coast, but I was up north.

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:06.490
So part of what I thought
I needed to understand

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.800
was the southern
culture as well.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.550
So that was my reporting.

00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:13.760
RICHARD GINGRAS: So I think
when most of us think of Apple

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.354
and think of Jobs, we think
of the product vision.

00:08:18.354 --> 00:08:20.250
We think it his
intense attention

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:23.549
to detail in building products.

00:08:23.549 --> 00:08:25.090
And one other thing
that surprised me

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.360
when I read the
book, in a good way,

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.240
was how much focus you
put on the supply chain.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.120
And I can understand
its relevance.

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.360
One, we're seeing interesting
political problems and problems

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.680
of labor management and so on
and so forth come out of that.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.410
They're certainly
interesting threads

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:51.210
in terms of Apple's innovation
in material science.

00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:54.720
And of course, it's what
Tim Cook's expertise is.

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:57.295
But what drove you to go there?

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:59.170
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Part of it was certainly

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:05.250
because these factory conditions
were getting so much scrutiny.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.820
This was shortly after the "New
York Times" series went out.

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:12.480
And I've been in
journalism long enough

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.380
to know that how you
characterize things really

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.510
is such a personal thing.

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:22.910
And I'd spent some time in Asia
as a correspondent as well,

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:26.850
and I know how the realities
in certain countries

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:29.410
can be understood
differently in others.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.210
So I wanted to make that
decision for myself.

00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:35.510
But also because so
much of Apple's business

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:37.790
is reliant on the supply chain.

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:42.120
Foxconn and Apple kind
of grew up together,

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.790
and they've gotten big together.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:48.500
And I think the way
their relationship works

00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:54.890
is an incredibly important
part of Apple's success.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:10:00.080
And when that starts
breaking down,

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:02.100
it has profound implications.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:04.640
The other thing is that I
think what gets lost here

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:09.090
is that Foxconn is just as
much of a dynamic company

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.350
as Apple is, arguably.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:14.940
It has a very dynamic
CEO, very ambitious.

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.760
Has also really done the
impossible to get his company

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:22.270
at the scale and size it is.

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:26.470
And it is technically,
because of the relationship,

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.100
it is a supplier to Apple.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.100
But it is in no way
subservient to Apple.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:37.210
And I wanted to
really understand

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:41.060
where they're coming from
and what their interests are.

00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:46.610
Because those motivations,
when they start changing,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.860
that has profound
implications for Apple.

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:52.460
RICHARD GINGRAS: I think that
was certainly interesting

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:57.640
in not only the, I think, the
public perception of Apple

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.290
in terms of how the
products are produced,

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.980
but also one of the
things you surfaced

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.970
was how the suppliers
are in a sense

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:09.050
now learning how to fight
back against Google,

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:13.840
against Apple, which obviously
raises its own set of issues.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:20.120
But let me, if I can, take
us back to Jobs's role.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.640
I worked at Apple
in the '90s, but I

00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:24.580
worked at Apple in
the in-between period

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.360
when Steve wasn't there, when
the product line expanded

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:35.740
from three different Macs to
five different product lines.

00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.500
Every division had
its own product line.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.200
It was rather run amok.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.980
My own sense is that one
of his greatest strengths

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:47.040
was, in a sense, as
an editor of making

00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:50.330
the hard decisions about what
survived and went to market

00:11:50.330 --> 00:11:52.810
and what did not.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.860
And frankly, my
own perception is

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:57.100
that's probably one of
their biggest challenges

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:00.490
going forward, is how do you
decide, with all of these very

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.110
creative people in
their workforce,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:06.050
all competing for attention,
all with great ideas,

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:08.430
winnowing down to the
one, two, or three that

00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:10.210
actually should see the market.

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:12.014
What did you learn about that?

00:12:12.014 --> 00:12:14.180
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I think
that's absolutely true,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.520
and it's the way
people who've worked

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:22.235
for him have characterized
his strengths as well.

00:12:22.235 --> 00:12:23.860
I had a really
interesting conversation

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:28.590
with a former Apple
senior manager.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.020
This was a couple months ago.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.720
And we were talking about
what's changed today.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.610
And one of the things he said
that I thought was interesting

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:40.860
was he said,
everybody's wondering

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.980
who has the vision
at Apple today.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.220
And he said, the
problem isn't vision.

00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:49.290
There's lots of vision at Apple.

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:52.060
The problem is
that there are now

00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:56.440
thousands of different
visions and not just one.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.920
And that's Apple's challenge.

00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:00.260
And that really rang true to me.

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.176
RICHARD GINGRAS: Yeah.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.780
But also, in fairness,
I would actually

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.120
suggest that some of the
challenges they're facing

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.085
are indeed of Job's own making.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.400
One I would point to is
his absolute insistence

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.570
over the years of maintaining
the proprietary unlicensed

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:27.060
nature of the platform, such
that even where they introduced

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.600
the iPhone and quickly
dominated the space.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.720
But obviously, that's
been eaten away.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.620
It's hard to compete with
40 producers of phones

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:41.740
working off of other OSes
versus licensing off of yours.

00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.330
Some would look
at that in a sense

00:13:43.330 --> 00:13:47.460
as a squandered opportunity.

00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:50.020
Do you think there's
likely to be change

00:13:50.020 --> 00:13:51.910
in that regard at
Apple, or are you

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:56.775
hearing the same sort of
adherence to his philosophy?

00:13:56.775 --> 00:13:58.150
YUKARI IWATANI
KANE: People think

00:13:58.150 --> 00:14:00.010
that Apple's
starting to open up.

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:01.910
I think there was an
announcement at WWEC

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:07.340
last week where they
were going to-- the home

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.345
kit was going to work
with third party products.

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:17.950
My feeling is that whatever
they do, if they change,

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:18.900
it won't be enough.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.190
Because it's just so entrenched
in their culture to not

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:26.360
want to be open.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:31.120
The secrecy is part of
it, and their inability

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:35.130
to share even things
that they need to.

00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:40.080
And I think that's something
that's so deep in Apple's DNA

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.380
that I'm not sure--
they may try,

00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:47.290
but I would guess that it's
not going to be enough.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:50.510
Whatever they do, it'll
just come a little bit more

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:54.900
slowly than it should, or it
would be a little bit more

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:56.680
limiting than it should.

00:14:56.680 --> 00:15:03.820
And those are the little
things that ultimately

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:08.790
create a Sony type situation.

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:10.880
RICHARD GINGRAS: I recall--
and again, I was there

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.050
in a very bad period for Apple,
and probably the market share

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.560
was 6%.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.340
But it was such
an insular culture

00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:22.120
that frankly, you could
live inside the Apple world

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.890
and not even think that Windows
existed was how severe they

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:28.380
were inured from
the outside world.

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:32.780
Obviously, that
can be problematic

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:34.660
and has proven to
be problematic.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:41.010
But one thing I learned was
that I had thought with iTunes,

00:15:41.010 --> 00:15:45.400
this was a big opportunity for
them in a sense to break out.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.170
And they made iTunes
available on Windows

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:52.250
to stimulate iPod
sales, I should say.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:57.060
And that was actually something
that Steve was not in favor of

00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:59.380
and had to be basically
forced by his team to do.

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.130
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Yeah, the story I got

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:06.260
was that Steve was
very much against it.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.610
He wanted to keep it just
to the Mac ecosystem.

00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:12.530
And essentially his entire
senior management team

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.710
at that time laid on the tracks
and convinced him otherwise.

00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:19.520
And it was one of
those situations where

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:21.860
he was like, fine, do
you what you want to do.

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.080
But if you screw up,
if it doesn't work out,

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.710
then it's your head.

00:16:26.710 --> 00:16:28.600
But they believed
strongly enough.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.400
And of course, now that it's
successful, as everything else,

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.088
Steve claims credit.

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.770
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Though, in a sense,

00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:41.100
it's hard not to think
that his push back on that

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:42.950
did not have a cultural impact.

00:16:42.950 --> 00:16:46.010
Because I still have a
hard time looking at Apple

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:49.930
as being as dedicated
to cloud development

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:54.180
as many would suggest
the market would demand.

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.750
And I don't know how much of
that is sort of reticence or--

00:16:57.750 --> 00:16:59.250
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
I mean, I think

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:05.020
the cloud-- Apple's culture
just seems to work against,

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:10.540
be so contrary to what great
cloud software demands.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:13.099
And I think it's a weakness.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:15.670
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Yeah.

00:17:15.670 --> 00:17:21.300
So in reading the book
and going back over how

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.359
Apple has been covered
in the last few years,

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:29.480
it's hard not to escape
the fact that the brand has

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.590
been tarnished a bit.

00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:34.370
I mean, the fact that Apple has
twice in that period of time

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:38.240
actually come out with
public apologies about one

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.280
matter or another, which is
something that he certainly

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.880
would not have done.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:46.170
I mean, this is a company that
has managed the press more

00:17:46.170 --> 00:17:49.955
tightly than probably any
other American media company.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:57.810
And there too, I suspect
there's a change in philosophy.

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:00.340
Or is it just the fact
that Tim and others there

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.870
don't have the same ability
to, in a sense, reality

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.210
distort that Steve had?

00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:11.790
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: We've all
known what a great marketer

00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:15.300
Steve is, or was.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.770
I don't think I myself
realized how important

00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:20.560
that was to Apple's success.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.420
Because I do think that Apple's
lost control of its narrative.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.160
And it's because
Steve isn't there.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:33.815
Steve inspired people in a way
that just defied rationality.

00:18:33.815 --> 00:18:38.100
I mean, people were inspired
by whatever Steve said,

00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:39.980
whether it was promises
of things to come

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:45.220
or the fabulousness of something
that Apple has released.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.080
And I was in so many
launch events for something

00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:54.320
where he's announcing
something, and the cheers

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.210
are enormous, the
whistles, everything.

00:18:57.210 --> 00:18:59.202
And you feel like,
oh my god, Apple's

00:18:59.202 --> 00:19:00.410
done this really great thing.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:01.826
And then you go
back to your desk,

00:19:01.826 --> 00:19:03.870
and you're like, oh,
well, wait a second.

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:05.600
Google had this already.

00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.132
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:09.132 --> 00:19:11.090
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: It's
not that interesting.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:12.680
It's a cosmetic fix.

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:18.940
But he got people really worked
up and excited about things.

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:22.520
And Apple really doesn't
have anybody today

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.640
that can inspire that kind
of irrational exuberance

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.980
about the company.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.990
And when you listen to
what they're saying,

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.990
they're actually saying
a lot of the same things

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:32.750
that Steve said.

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:35.110
I mean, they're still
operating by the same playbook.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:37.730
They talk about these
amazing things to come.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.220
And the wording is very
similar to what Steve said.

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:44.150
And so they're trying to do what
he did, but it just falls flat.

00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:49.175
And I think that's just the
difference in who is saying it.

00:19:49.175 --> 00:19:50.550
RICHARD GINGRAS:
It almost speaks

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.830
to the charisma, the
showmanship, as it were.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:20:00.480
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Yeah,
and it's not just the impact

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:03.340
that it has to
consumers, but it's

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:09.100
about his ability to inspire the
employees, his executive team,

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.294
his shareholders, the board.

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:12.710
When you think
about it, Apple-- I

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:16.290
mean, if you are the CEO of a
company of so many constituents

00:20:16.290 --> 00:20:18.241
that you have to respond
to-- the suppliers.

00:20:18.241 --> 00:20:19.990
I mean, the suppliers
are working for you,

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:24.060
but everybody knows that no
matter how much money you pay,

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.170
if their hearts not in it, it's
just not going to be as good.

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:34.140
And so when the message is
a little bit less powerful,

00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:38.470
there are a lot of ramifications
for all those different people.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.060
RICHARD GINGRAS: By the way,
get your questions ready.

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:43.910
I'll be turning to the audience
for questions in a minute.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.040
Would love to hear them.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:53.510
So let's go to your
bottom line quickly.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:56.650
So what is your sense?

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.690
Is Apple going to stay great?

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:02.000
Are we going to see-- are they
going to weather the storm,

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.580
or is this in a sense the
waning of Apple's significance

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:10.205
as a consumer
electronics company?

00:21:10.205 --> 00:21:12.330
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I
mean, it's a tricky question

00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:16.370
because it depends
on how you define it.

00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:18.310
From a revenue and
profit standpoint,

00:21:18.310 --> 00:21:22.700
Apple will be making money for
a really long time to come.

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:26.290
But if you are talking
about Apple's ability

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:32.930
to create the waves and
innovate and come out

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:40.780
with game-changing devices,
I just don't see it.

00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:43.650
I mean, I think Apple
could stay a good company.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:46.750
But the insanely great
company that it's been,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:48.340
I'm just not sure
that's possible.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:55.780
And if you look back
in history, Apple

00:21:55.780 --> 00:21:58.090
is going through a
lot of the same things

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:02.080
that a lot of empires
have gone before them.

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:08.020
And it feels a little bit like--
I call it business physics,

00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:12.746
but there's a force that
as you get more successful,

00:22:12.746 --> 00:22:14.120
wants to bring
you to the center.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:19.000
And that's the challenge
that Apple is facing.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:19.530
We'll see.

00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:23.330
I mean, they've defied
the odds before.

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:25.190
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Yeah, and there's

00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:29.570
an interesting
bridge from there.

00:22:29.570 --> 00:22:34.910
They recently
acquired Beats, which

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:37.460
means that Dr. Dre and
Jimmy Iovine are going

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.530
to be wearing badges and taking
the bus down from San Francisco

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:43.500
to work at Apple every day.

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:48.740
But interestingly, an
ex-Googler, Paul Buccheit,

00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:52.460
upon that announcement suggested
that with the savvy of Beats

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:55.930
that Apple will be able
to design wearables

00:22:55.930 --> 00:22:59.720
for the mass market
that Google could not.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.530
Which frankly, I
kind of chuckled at

00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:04.880
because there's
no question, Beats

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.600
was successful in
getting a lot of people

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.020
to wear soup cans
back around their ears

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.730
with the Beats headphones again.

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:13.470
I'm not sure if
that's the secret

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:14.970
of getting into the mass market.

00:23:14.970 --> 00:23:18.460
But what's your sense of
the Beats acquisition?

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.479
How is that going to work?

00:23:20.479 --> 00:23:22.270
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
It's a great question.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:28.510
I wrote an analysis
about it as well.

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:33.600
And it is a puzzling
acquisition to me.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:38.940
There's the thought that--
$3 billion is a lot of money.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.740
Apple developed the
iPhone, I think,

00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.240
on a couple hundred
million dollars.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:49.530
So what does Beats offer that
they couldn't do themselves?

00:23:49.530 --> 00:23:52.306
From an aesthetic perspective--
I think the financials,

00:23:52.306 --> 00:23:54.430
maybe there's a way that
the financials make sense.

00:23:54.430 --> 00:23:57.996
But from a larger
sense, aesthetically

00:23:57.996 --> 00:23:59.370
the Beats aesthetic
is completely

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:01.050
opposite of Apple's aesthetic.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:07.790
It's a company that has made
money built on marketing,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:10.740
not as much on-- I
don't think they're

00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:13.392
known for the quality
of their headphones.

00:24:13.392 --> 00:24:14.350
RICHARD GINGRAS: Right.

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.516
They're a marketing company.

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:17.996
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
They're a marketing company.

00:24:17.996 --> 00:24:19.370
And I don't know
if this is true.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.453
People have also told me
that their headphones are

00:24:21.453 --> 00:24:24.727
more popular outside of
the US than inside the US.

00:24:24.727 --> 00:24:26.310
And the young people
outside of the US

00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:27.860
buy them because
it's a way for them

00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.810
to connect to the
American culture.

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:34.250
I have no idea how
that adds to Apple.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:42.150
And people have talked about
how Apple is buying Beats cool.

00:24:42.150 --> 00:24:45.174
And if Apple, which
has defined cool--

00:24:45.174 --> 00:24:46.590
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Has defined cool.

00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:48.089
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
For the last 15

00:24:48.089 --> 00:24:50.280
years is buying
Beats for its cool,

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:54.060
then they're really in a lot
more trouble than we think.

00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.720
RICHARD GINGRAS: I think
that is the conclusion.

00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:59.740
I mean, when thinking about
it with regard to Jobs,

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:04.600
the only phrase I could think of
was turning over in his grave.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.622
It seems quite hard
to believe that that

00:25:07.622 --> 00:25:10.080
would have been something he
would have been supportive of.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.246
But let's turn to questions.

00:25:15.504 --> 00:25:19.200
AUDIENCE: Do you think Steve
Jobs had any other choices

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.142
besides Cook in terms of--
I mean, from your book,

00:25:24.142 --> 00:25:25.225
it seemed like they were--

00:25:25.225 --> 00:25:26.683
RICHARD GINGRAS:
I thought you were

00:25:26.683 --> 00:25:28.920
going to say besides dying.

00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:31.350
Reality distortion
field to its ultimate.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.490
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I've
said this a couple of times.

00:25:36.490 --> 00:25:38.310
I actually think the
more interesting one

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:40.760
was Ron Johnson.

00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.390
It was actually a name
that was whispered

00:25:45.390 --> 00:25:46.960
by a couple of my sources.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.320
Nobody's going to say it
on the record or out loud.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.730
But I heard it from a
couple different people

00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:58.040
when the leadership
change was announced

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.140
that it should have been Ron.

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:03.330
But the more I think about
it, the more I agree.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:05.880
Because Ron Johnson was
the head of Apple Retail.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.010
And he was the architect
of the Apple Stores.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:12.000
And Steve was involved in the
Apple Stores in the extent that

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.770
he cared about the look
and feel of the stores,

00:26:14.770 --> 00:26:18.020
but the culture that was built
and the success is really

00:26:18.020 --> 00:26:18.520
Ron's.

00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:23.900
It operated fairly
autonomously within Apple.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:26.950
And he's an incredibly
charismatic guy.

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:29.450
I have a ton of respect for him.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.880
I know he went to JC Penney
and didn't do too well,

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.580
but I think a lot of that
had to do with JC Penney.

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:40.820
In terms of what
he did at Apple,

00:26:40.820 --> 00:26:43.080
he was a very
impressive executive.

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:46.310
And he would have had
the ability to inspire,

00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:50.280
and he would have
certainly had the vision.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.040
The worst thing that people have
said about Ron that I've heard

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.930
is that he enjoys his money.

00:26:54.930 --> 00:26:59.480
But what executive doesn't?

00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:04.310
And I think it goes back
to Steve, his unwillingness

00:27:04.310 --> 00:27:06.820
to share the spotlight.

00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:11.040
And a lot of executives
left, eventually

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:13.860
ended up leaving,
because of that.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:20.120
And it was the
weakness in his genius.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.870
I share a story in my
book about the first time

00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:28.330
he was diagnosed with cancer.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.780
And when he announces
it, the stock rose,

00:27:31.780 --> 00:27:33.244
I think by only 1% or 2%.

00:27:33.244 --> 00:27:35.535
And when he heard about it,
he was really disappointed,

00:27:35.535 --> 00:27:37.370
and he was like, that's it?

00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:42.310
And so he was
definitely a guy who

00:27:42.310 --> 00:27:46.200
may not have wanted his
private life probed, but wanted

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.400
Apple to be about him.

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.350
And I think that's
part of the challenge

00:27:50.350 --> 00:27:51.504
that Apple faces today.

00:27:51.504 --> 00:27:53.920
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well, it had
to be an internal candidate.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.380
There was no way they
were going to bring

00:27:55.380 --> 00:27:56.700
in someone from the outside.

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.660
And so you're really left
with few possibilities.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.210
I mean, there's Eddy Cue.

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:06.650
There's Ives, though
I'm not sure about that.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:08.940
Obviously Scott Forstall
was not going to be a--

00:28:08.940 --> 00:28:10.023
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Yeah.

00:28:10.023 --> 00:28:12.460
I mean, as part of
the book, I talk

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.510
about this-- there's a
Harvard professor called

00:28:15.510 --> 00:28:16.700
Gautam Mukunda.

00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:20.540
And interestingly, Apple brought
him in to Apple University

00:28:20.540 --> 00:28:22.260
to talk about his
leadership theories.

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:29.330
But one of the things,
his ideas about executives

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:36.360
who rise up within the
system and are chosen,

00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.080
and then ones who
just are chosen

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.640
despite all the odds, and it
was just a complete anomaly.

00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.940
And one of the things he says
is that those executives have

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.890
a high failure rate,
but when they succeed,

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.490
it's just tremendous.

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:55.490
And Steve falls into
that because there

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.760
was no way he would have
returned to Apple if it

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.790
wasn't near bankruptcy.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.230
And the other
category, of course,

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:07.180
is the executive that
rises within the company.

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:08.830
And for that executive,
it's very hard

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.500
to think outside the box
because the entire reason

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:15.040
they were chosen is because
they fit so well in the culture,

00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.860
and they were doing so
well in the culture.

00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:20.870
And those executives, there's
not that much difference.

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.120
If you look at the top three
candidates that arise out

00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:26.060
of that, there's not that
much difference between them.

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.010
And the likelihood
that they're going

00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.890
to do something
completely out of the box

00:29:30.890 --> 00:29:33.280
is very rare,
although you can still

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.475
have very good executives.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.400
And so Tim Cook would
be typical of that.

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:47.700
And I think in that sense,
yeah, it's a good question.

00:29:47.700 --> 00:29:50.430
I mean I, think Tim Cook
was the obvious choice,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:53.830
given all of the realities.

00:29:53.830 --> 00:30:00.142
But I'm not sure we can
expect a Steve Jobs.

00:30:00.142 --> 00:30:02.600
RICHARD GINGRAS: What's your
take on Ives, for that matter?

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.160
He's a mysterious character.

00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.930
He only appears in videos
and product introductions.

00:30:08.930 --> 00:30:10.110
What is he hiding?

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.400
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Well, Apple has

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.660
been trying to portray him as
Steve's visionary successor.

00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.010
I think for me, one
of the things that we

00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:24.560
need to be aware of is that
he's an industrial designer.

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.910
And he's probably one of the
greatest industrial designers

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.170
of his generation,
if not the greatest.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.320
But he's an industrial
designer, and so what

00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:39.090
makes him a genius in
that is that he cares

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:43.640
about the appearance, and
he pushes the boundaries

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:47.330
of aesthetics
without consideration

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:50.800
of how things work
or can work inside.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:54.441
And so he is getting more
and more responsibility.

00:30:54.441 --> 00:30:55.940
And what I worry
there is that we're

00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:58.340
going to end up with beautiful
products that work just

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.000
a little bit less well because
he cares more about how things

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.872
look.

00:31:02.872 --> 00:31:05.080
RICHARD GINGRAS: But he's
lost his editor in a sense.

00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.110
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: And
he's lost his editor.

00:31:06.110 --> 00:31:08.240
And anybody who does
creative work knows that,

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:10.746
no matter how
brilliant you are, you

00:31:10.746 --> 00:31:12.620
miss something when you
don't have an editor.

00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:17.270
And so Apple's successes
happened because of the team,

00:31:17.270 --> 00:31:20.220
the partnership between
Steve and Johnny.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:25.370
And one good question is,
who's Johnny's partner now?

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:26.725
And I don't see anybody.

00:31:26.725 --> 00:31:28.100
RICHARD GINGRAS:
And importantly,

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:29.155
who can push back on him?

00:31:29.155 --> 00:31:30.780
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Who can push back.

00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.700
Yeah.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.430
I mean, I just don't
see Tim doing that.

00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:36.090
RICHARD GINGRAS: Right.

00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:39.510
And how about Eddy Cue, because
he's really the only other?

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.750
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I don't
think Eddy has the authority.

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:48.470
He just made senior vice
president a couple years ago.

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:54.380
And his area is iTunes
and deal making,

00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.340
and I don't see him
being super involved

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.580
in product development.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.210
RICHARD GINGRAS: Questions?

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:07.560
AUDIENCE: So if we
look at stock market

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:13.230
as the aggregate view of the
overall society on the prospect

00:32:13.230 --> 00:32:17.440
of a company, or their
sentiment about it,

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.300
over the past
three months alone,

00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:24.460
Apple has added about $120
billion to their market cap.

00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:30.080
That's more than Twitter,
Netflix, Tesla, and Yahoo

00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:32.700
put together, like
their entire worth.

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.480
So where is this
sentiment coming from?

00:32:38.209 --> 00:32:40.000
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Apple's strongest base

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:52.940
has always been the Apple
fans and the support

00:32:52.940 --> 00:32:56.170
of people who love
their products.

00:32:56.170 --> 00:32:59.890
I've been covering business and
financial news for a long time,

00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:09.070
and the way the stock market
moves is psychological as well.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:13.232
And so Apple is helped
by a lot of people

00:33:13.232 --> 00:33:14.940
who want to think
about the best of them.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.520
I mean, the market is
also doing generally well.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:19.610
And from a profit and
revenue standpoint,

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.670
Apple will make money
for a long time to come.

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.710
I mean, their pie is
so big at this point.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:30.980
In some ways, it probably makes
sense to put a bet on Apple

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.920
from that perspective.

00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.120
I mean, the way
I look at it, I'm

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.880
looking at it from
a much higher plane,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:44.960
and just what happens to--
Apple's own definition

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.780
of a vision has been to make
insanely great products that

00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.860
change the world.

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:54.950
And what is happening to
that is more of my interest.

00:33:54.950 --> 00:34:02.250
And regardless of whether
they pull through or not,

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:05.060
there's no question that
this period, this last couple

00:34:05.060 --> 00:34:07.580
of years and maybe a
couple more years to come,

00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:12.270
is a major event in
Apple's corporate history.

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:15.840
And it presents a
lot of challenges.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:19.780
One, because of the
transition, but also because it

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:25.415
grew so fast and has all of a
sudden gone from an underdog

00:34:25.415 --> 00:34:26.940
to a dominant company.

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.880
And in many ways, it still
has that underdog culture.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.620
And so there are
growing pains from that.

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:38.420
And those are the stories that I
was interested in and following

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.344
and thinking about.

00:34:39.344 --> 00:34:41.760
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well, I think
the key point there is that

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.960
obviously, in the fast-changing
world of technology,

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:55.449
is are they going to be the next
great new entries of products

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:56.800
on their part?

00:34:56.800 --> 00:34:58.320
What's the big new
invention that's

00:34:58.320 --> 00:34:59.960
going to carry them
forward, or inventions

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.501
that are going to
carry them forward?

00:35:01.501 --> 00:35:04.350
Wall Street doesn't typically
do a very good job of--

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:08.590
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: And I think
also financially, the cracks

00:35:08.590 --> 00:35:10.720
start appearing
long before you see

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:15.200
any cracks in the financials.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.310
I used to cover Sony
before I covered Apple.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.460
And Sony was doing well
for a really long time

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:23.840
before it started
going off of a cliff.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.710
And when you look back at
where things went wrong,

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:31.280
it started to happen when
things looked really, really

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.756
good for them.

00:35:32.756 --> 00:35:35.130
RICHARD GINGRAS: And also with
the loss of their founder.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:36.588
YUKARI IWATANI
KANE: Yeah, exactly.

00:35:36.588 --> 00:35:37.760
RICHARD GINGRAS: Morita.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:38.260
Questions?

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:38.801
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:38.801 --> 00:35:40.540
As someone on the
communications team,

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:44.150
I actually have a question
about the process a little bit.

00:35:44.150 --> 00:35:47.220
First, did Apple
participate in this book?

00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:51.380
And second, even covering
them for the past three years

00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.880
or however long
you've covered them,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.240
how have you worked with
that culture of secrecy

00:35:57.240 --> 00:36:00.040
and not sort of talking a lot?

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.730
How have you had to change
your reporting style

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:06.410
to get the scoops and figure
out how to work with them?

00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.740
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: It's a
lot of guerrilla reporting.

00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:16.220
In answer to your
first question,

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.450
I did keep Apple in the
loop for a long time.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:21.960
I told them first when I
started working on the book.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.650
I told them when I
sold the book and kept

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:29.500
them updated for about
a year and a half,

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:33.230
until they officially
declined to cooperate.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.270
At which point, I decided
that my obligations were over.

00:36:37.270 --> 00:36:40.130
But it was well
into-- I explained

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.610
when the direction
of the book changed.

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:48.150
I was also sending emails
to Tim Cook regularly.

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:51.297
When I went to China
and I came back,

00:36:51.297 --> 00:36:53.130
I sent him an email
with some of my thoughts

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:56.000
and invited him to
correct me where I'm wrong

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.710
and things like that.

00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:58.600
They didn't respond.

00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.690
RICHARD GINGRAS: Did he engage?

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.273
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
He didn't engage.

00:37:01.273 --> 00:37:02.849
RICHARD GINGRAS:
He didn't engage.

00:37:02.849 --> 00:37:05.390
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Which was
expected because Apple doesn't

00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:09.150
typically cooperate
on these books.

00:37:09.150 --> 00:37:11.170
But it just makes
you work harder.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:15.260
And I don't think--
I actually have

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.970
come to believe
that I was helped

00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:21.000
by their lack of cooperation
because it allowed me to stay

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.860
independent in my thinking,
and it made me work harder.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:28.970
And also because
after Steve died,

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.290
Apple's executives have been
out in the media so much.

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:35.230
And their message is
pretty consistent.

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:38.050
Nobody ever gets anything that
Apple didn't intend to say.

00:37:38.050 --> 00:37:41.275
And so I felt that even if
I had gotten interviews,

00:37:41.275 --> 00:37:43.400
all they would have said
was the same thing they've

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:44.858
said everywhere
else, and I already

00:37:44.858 --> 00:37:46.740
had that because it
was on the record.

00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:49.540
And so I had that,
and then I was

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:52.580
in addition able to get
this 360 degree view.

00:37:52.580 --> 00:37:56.091
I was talking to people who
worked-- with regards to Tim

00:37:56.091 --> 00:37:57.840
Cook, for example, I
was talking to people

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.830
who worked for Tim Cook,
who Tim Cook worked for.

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:04.970
I talked to his school
friends from Robertsdale,

00:38:04.970 --> 00:38:07.990
teachers, professors.

00:38:07.990 --> 00:38:11.807
It just challenges
you to go deep.

00:38:11.807 --> 00:38:14.100
AUDIENCE: How do you convince
them to talk with you?

00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:23.650
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: People
like to tell stories.

00:38:23.650 --> 00:38:26.840
The difference with book writing
and newspaper article writing

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.630
is that when I was
at the "Journal,"

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:30.630
it was much more of a
challenge because I wanted

00:38:30.630 --> 00:38:32.800
to know what the next
product looked like.

00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:35.494
I mean, I was asking people
to share corporate secrets.

00:38:35.494 --> 00:38:37.160
And that's a much
more challenging thing

00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.960
to do than to ask people
to share their memories.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:45.090
And I think people are
usually happy to do that

00:38:45.090 --> 00:38:48.060
as long as you're not
going to dash off and just

00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:48.970
focus on that.

00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.730
And so I convinced
them with the promise

00:38:50.730 --> 00:38:54.020
of telling the whole story.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.630
And then you spend a
lot of time with them.

00:38:57.630 --> 00:39:00.100
I've have three, four
hour conversations,

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:02.150
and I didn't get anything
until the fourth hour.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:06.040
Usually the first-- when
I was interviewing people

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.040
about Tim Cook, for
example, for the first hour,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.020
people are like, well,
Tim's a great boss.

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:11.830
I respect him a lot.

00:39:11.830 --> 00:39:13.660
He's very driven.

00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.720
He has high demands.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:18.370
And then you probe for certain
stories, how he handled things,

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:22.152
and then you get the real story.

00:39:22.152 --> 00:39:24.610
RICHARD GINGRAS: So suffice to
say Katie Cotton didn't send

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.932
you a note of congratulations
when the book came out.

00:39:26.932 --> 00:39:28.098
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: No, no.

00:39:28.098 --> 00:39:29.027
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:29.027 --> 00:39:31.360
RICHARD GINGRAS: Have you had
dealings with Apple since?

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:34.100
Are you off the invite list
for product [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:36.500
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Oh,
I was off the invite list

00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:41.640
from the time that I began
working on this book.

00:39:41.640 --> 00:39:44.595
They did have one, I guess,
momentary lapse in judgment

00:39:44.595 --> 00:39:46.720
when they invited me to
their shareholders meeting.

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:52.050
But otherwise, I was
watching the video

00:39:52.050 --> 00:39:55.000
feeds like everybody else.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.092
RICHARD GINGRAS: So what
are you focusing on next?

00:39:58.092 --> 00:40:00.550
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Right now
I'm still promoting my book.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:06.340
My Japanese launch of
the translated version

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:08.960
will publish in Japan
in a couple weeks.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.580
And they're having
me over there.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:17.370
So I'm preparing for that, and
still very much on this story.

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:20.474
But I am starting to think
about some other books,

00:40:20.474 --> 00:40:22.390
and I'd eventually like
to write another book.

00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:24.050
RICHARD GINGRAS: So the other
interesting thing about Apple,

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.690
of course, is the
fan boy culture.

00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:32.485
Have you suffered at the
hands of the fan boy culture

00:40:32.485 --> 00:40:33.810
since this book came out?

00:40:33.810 --> 00:40:35.580
I mean you--

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.550
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
The short answer is yes.

00:40:37.550 --> 00:40:39.380
RICHARD GINGRAS:
And exactly how?

00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.450
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
Well, the opinions

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.845
have been all over the spectrum.

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.660
Tim Cook-- I don't know
if some of you may know,

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.410
but Tim Cook
commented on my book,

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.035
basically on the afternoon of
the first day that the book--

00:40:58.035 --> 00:40:58.880
AUDIENCE: On Amazon?

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:01.360
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
No, I think he--

00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.780
I had a CNBC interview
that morning,

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:08.570
and he was responding
to a CNBC reporter that

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.180
asked him for a comment.

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.555
But he said my
book was nonsense.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.260
And I went out with
my own statement

00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:21.740
because I was in an interview
with another reporter

00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.340
at the time that the
comment came out,

00:41:23.340 --> 00:41:25.730
which was a strange
sensation as a reporter.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:35.640
But that unleashed all these
Apple fans who are like, yeah,

00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:37.580
that's nonsense.

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.000
My book got
zero-bombed on Amazon.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.420
So if you go to
Amazon, there's a lot

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:46.410
of-- there's one star
ratings and five star ratings

00:41:46.410 --> 00:41:46.910
basically.

00:41:50.169 --> 00:41:51.960
And they were happening
from the first day,

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:56.570
so before anybody really had
a chance to read the book.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:59.370
I mean, it's what makes
covering Apple so interesting.

00:42:02.130 --> 00:42:05.900
It's to be expected, and I think
it's one of Apple's greatest

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:10.190
strengths is that people are so
passionate about the company.

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:15.170
And so you can't
begrudge them that.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.720
But one thing to watch is
to see how that changes,

00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:21.042
or whether that changes
as the years go on.

00:42:21.042 --> 00:42:22.500
RICHARD GINGRAS:
What did you think

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:26.540
of their recent announcements?

00:42:30.806 --> 00:42:34.000
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I
thought a couple of things.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.890
I was shocked at
how much more muted

00:42:37.890 --> 00:42:42.277
it was compared to some of the
WWDCs when Steve was there.

00:42:42.277 --> 00:42:43.110
I was shocked that--

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:45.485
RICHARD GINGRAS: Muted in the
reaction, or muted in the--

00:42:45.485 --> 00:42:48.120
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: In the
reaction and the excitement.

00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:53.350
I was surprised that everything
was a pre-announcement.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:57.040
One of the things that Steve
really felt strongly about

00:42:57.040 --> 00:42:59.640
was that you announce things--
you don't announce things

00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.130
until they're ready.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:04.700
And then you capitalize on the
excitement by offering it up.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.710
And everything was
a pre-announcement.

00:43:07.710 --> 00:43:11.836
There wasn't a single
thing you could access.

00:43:11.836 --> 00:43:13.460
I mean, there was
even one announcement

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:15.334
where they showed
something that wasn't going

00:43:15.334 --> 00:43:20.080
to be available until next year,
which was just insane to me.

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:25.550
But in a different way,
a lot of the things

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:28.820
that Apple's been doing recently
has been really interesting

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:29.320
for me.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:32.500
Because what I see is I
see Apple trying to evolve.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:38.330
They're trying to move away
from what would Steve Jobs do.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:41.450
I think, as I was writing
this book, one of the themes

00:43:41.450 --> 00:43:44.210
that kept coming up and what
was obvious was Apple trying

00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:46.730
to prove that nothing has
changed without Steve.

00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:48.960
I mean, you saw that in
Tim Cook's statements.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:53.530
He would say, we're
just as strong as ever.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:57.730
Innovation continues
to be our North Star.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.180
Nothing has changed.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.800
And that wasn't
convincing to me.

00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:02.900
Because everything has
changed without Steve.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.530
And now I feel like
you're starting

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:10.740
to see Apple understanding that
and trying to move past it.

00:44:10.740 --> 00:44:12.400
They didn't make it
as clear at WWDC,

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:16.770
but they are moving to a
new vision in the connected.

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:22.350
Home They're doing
different things.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:23.342
The Beats acquisition.

00:44:23.342 --> 00:44:24.800
I mean, for better
or for worse, it

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.424
was something probably
that Steve never

00:44:26.424 --> 00:44:27.840
would have considered.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.670
And so the question
to me, and what

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:32.380
will be most interesting
to me going forward,

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.640
is whether Apple's vision,
Apple's new vision,

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.310
and this new Apple, can
convince and inspire.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.210
Because that was what
Apple was fueled on

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:43.440
for the last 15 years.

00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.880
And so they can come up
with this grand vision,

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:49.650
but if people won't
come on board with it,

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.550
then it's not a good sign.

00:44:51.550 --> 00:44:53.091
RICHARD GINGRAS: I
mean, you actually

00:44:53.091 --> 00:44:55.950
seem to suggest that in some
of their recent announcements,

00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:58.520
last six months or so,
that they're actually

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.050
almost explicitly
putting distance

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.780
between themselves and Steve.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.260
A number of the
off-the-cuff references

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:09.730
with the introduction of
the new version of the iOS

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:12.120
of sort of pushing back
on real world metaphors

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:17.840
and so on and so forth, which
he was very much party to.

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:19.040
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Yeah.

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.290
Yeah, with the new iOS, I
thought that was interesting

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:22.830
because it was
almost-- I think it's

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:26.940
one of the steps in
grieving, to lash out

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:30.180
at the person who's
no longer around.

00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:36.740
And the comments that they
were making against the former

00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:39.760
look and feel, where
it was just almost

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.070
overly done and unwarranted
because it was something that

00:45:44.070 --> 00:45:46.040
had worked for them for so long.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.400
So it deserved at least
some modicum of respect.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.850
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
what's your take--

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:55.059
it's been how long
since he died?

00:45:55.059 --> 00:45:57.350
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: It's
been two, almost three years.

00:45:57.350 --> 00:45:58.850
RICHARD GINGRAS:
Almost three years.

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:06.030
And we've heard these--
Tim Cook has almost

00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:08.790
sounded like Al Gore in the
lockbox with his reference

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:13.810
to the North Star on a
very, very repetitive basis.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:16.580
Eddy Cue comes out, who's--
these are good people.

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.340
I don't mean to sound critical.

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:19.400
Eddie Cue's a great guy.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.275
I mean, these are really
solid, solid people.

00:46:21.275 --> 00:46:24.310
He says, I think we've got the
greatest pipeline of products

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:26.050
that we've ever
had in our history.

00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:31.120
But still nothing's
quite coming to the fore.

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:33.890
What's your take of this?

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:35.570
What are you hearing?

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:37.240
Is there something
around the corner,

00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:40.750
or are they just vamping?

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:42.380
YUKARI IWATANI KANE:
I think-- well,

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.090
we know that they're working on
stuff, because we hear trickles

00:46:46.090 --> 00:46:48.170
about it, about the
watch, the television.

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:50.510
I do hear enough
evidence from Asia

00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:55.635
that there are real proposals
and real things going on.

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.130
RICHARD GINGRAS: Are
they being cautious

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:04.980
about-- because with
every new product launch,

00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:06.150
there's some risk.

00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:08.730
You don't know everything.

00:47:08.730 --> 00:47:13.030
And is there some sort of
enhanced concern on their part

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:16.540
about the first new
thing they do post Steve

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:21.940
not being as super successful
as they feel it needs to be?

00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.060
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I
think caution is definitely

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:25.620
weighing in.

00:47:25.620 --> 00:47:28.115
I mean, Tim Cook is much
more of a cautious executive.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.560
I mean, there are no guarantees
with product launches.

00:47:33.560 --> 00:47:40.120
But he wants as much-- he wants
all the I's dotted and the T's

00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.550
crossed, and he wants to
be as sure as possible.

00:47:42.550 --> 00:47:45.550
Because he knows that he's
got to hit a home run.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.200
And I do you think--
I mean, you feel

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.610
the weight of the
pressure just mounting.

00:47:51.610 --> 00:47:55.930
Every time they
miss an opportunity,

00:47:55.930 --> 00:47:59.320
the expectations
grow just as much.

00:48:02.250 --> 00:48:03.750
RICHARD GINGRAS:
And in a sense, you

00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:06.041
could say-- I haven't really
thought about it that way,

00:48:06.041 --> 00:48:09.100
but in a sense, you could
say that the longer more

00:48:09.100 --> 00:48:13.710
time passes, the greater the
expectation that whatever they

00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:15.660
do, as you say, has
to be a home run.

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.030
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: I think
it's almost an impossible

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:20.040
situation for them
because they're such a--

00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:22.670
when you think about it,
they're such a big company.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:26.200
They're making $150 or $160
billion in revenues every year.

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.950
So how many watches
do they have to sell

00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:34.640
to add 5% to their top
line or bottom line?

00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.440
And then remember
that they're used

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:40.780
to profit margins of 30%, 40%.

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.730
And so how do you get
30%, 40%, from watches?

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.020
And then with
televisions, they're

00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.610
used to products that people
will upgrade to every year.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.790
I don't see a future
any world where

00:48:53.790 --> 00:48:56.230
people are going to upgrade
their televisions every two

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:58.270
or three years, much
less every year.

00:48:58.270 --> 00:49:03.780
And so the bar financially
for them to be successful

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.700
is higher as well.

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:09.500
And even though Apple's
going to keep making money

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.470
for a long time
to come, you have

00:49:11.470 --> 00:49:14.850
to ask, how will they
prove their success?

00:49:14.850 --> 00:49:18.190
What do they need to do
for their new product

00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:19.830
to be successful?

00:49:19.830 --> 00:49:27.432
And they will have to show
some sort of financial success.

00:49:27.432 --> 00:49:29.140
And that's really
challenging, especially

00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:32.580
when you consider that
Apple's first iPod wasn't

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:33.360
a blockbuster.

00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:35.330
Apple's first iPhone wasn't.

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:37.280
It's the usually the
second generation

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.750
and later that really takes off.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:44.310
And so the question
is, to me-- so the odds

00:49:44.310 --> 00:49:47.070
are the first product is
going to still have kinks.

00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:48.410
And it'll be interesting.

00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:50.000
Hopefully, it'll be interesting.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.567
But it's not going to
be enormous in terms

00:49:52.567 --> 00:49:53.150
of financials.

00:49:53.150 --> 00:49:56.020
And at that point,
what does Apple do?

00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.300
I mean, Steve was the
guy who'd still push.

00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.490
And he pushed harder.

00:50:00.490 --> 00:50:02.960
But is Tim that guy,
or is he the guy

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.630
who's going to be cautious
and start pulling back,

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:08.760
even before the product has
had a chance to be successful?

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:11.770
And that'll be something that's
really interesting to see.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:13.430
RICHARD GINGRAS: So
it makes me wonder,

00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:17.400
given A, their addiction
to high priced,

00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.730
high margin products,
the fact that they really

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:30.610
haven't won in the cloud, is
it almost too much to ask?

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:33.570
Is it almost interesting to
ask the reverse question?

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:36.240
If Steve were still
alive, would they not

00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:38.100
be still facing
these challenges,

00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:40.777
and would their likelihood of
success necessarily be better?

00:50:40.777 --> 00:50:41.860
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Yeah.

00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:46.100
I think that Apple would have
faced a lot of these challenges

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.780
even if Steve were here.

00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:50.190
He probably would have been
more successful at convincing

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.070
the world that these
challenges weren't

00:50:53.070 --> 00:50:58.140
there for a while longer
than is apparent now.

00:50:58.140 --> 00:51:02.830
And by the way, I think--
and part of Apple's challenge

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:06.340
is the competition around them.

00:51:06.340 --> 00:51:15.280
And from a management
perspective, Steve was Apple,

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.060
and he was able to take risks
and make really bold decisions

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.190
in a way that nobody ever
will be able to again.

00:51:20.190 --> 00:51:23.410
Because the board
worked for Steve.

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:28.860
And now going forward, the CEO
will be working for the board.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.670
But when you look
at the competition,

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:38.850
you have Google, and Larry,
who's got that authority.

00:51:38.850 --> 00:51:41.210
You've got Amazon
and Jeff Bezos.

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.760
You've got Facebook
and Mark Zuckerberg.

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.210
You've got Netflix
over there as well.

00:51:46.210 --> 00:51:48.430
And all of these
companies have the ability

00:51:48.430 --> 00:51:53.120
to make really bold decisions
and take much bigger risks

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.985
than Apple will because they
still have founder CEOs.

00:51:58.985 --> 00:52:01.110
RICHARD GINGRAS: Well, I
thank you very, very much.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:01.260
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Thank you.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.426
RICHARD GINGRAS: This has
been a great conversation,

00:52:03.426 --> 00:52:05.900
and a lot of good
food for thought.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:08.860
Questions that are relevant,
I think, obviously to Google

00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.990
as well, as we all
figure out, how

00:52:11.990 --> 00:52:15.306
do we evolve a big corporation
and continue to be innovative.

00:52:15.306 --> 00:52:16.930
So I thank you very
much for your work,

00:52:16.930 --> 00:52:18.550
and I look forward
to your next efforts.

00:52:18.550 --> 00:52:19.841
YUKARI IWATANI KANE: Thank you.

00:52:19.841 --> 00:52:21.015
Thanks.

00:52:21.015 --> 00:52:27.560
