you know in the process what we learned
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.510
you know in the process what we learned
is that in the ordinary organization

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520
is that in the ordinary organization
 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.060

favorable impressions of them and you
can say that's a human nature but it
