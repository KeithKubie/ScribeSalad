00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:11.030
Although the reviews of this year's Suicide
Squad movie have been mixed at best, there

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.490
were some aspects of the movie that were almost
universally praised.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.810
One of those was Margot Robbie's Harley Quinn.The
Aussie actress excelled in the role of the

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.820
Joker's insane but strangely likeable girlfriend
- and she looked gorgeous in the process.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.269
It's no surprise, therefore, that Warner Brothers
and DC have already made plans for a spin-off

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:29.960
solo movie for the character.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.250
That made us think about what we'd like to
see going on in that movie - and that's what

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.470
this video is all about.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.750
Here are 10 things we need in the Harley Quinn
solo movie.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.500
More About Her Origins
Suicide Squad certainly touched upon Harley

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.800
Quinn's origins - she was working at Arkham
Asylum as the Joker's psychiatrist, fell in

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.180
love with him, and was ultimately driven insane
by him - but they're so interesting that we'd

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.320
really like to see them explored in a deeper
manner in her solo movie.It doesn't need to

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.149
be an origin movie - that would mean setting
it in the past, and we'd really like to see

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:03.870
the DCEU progressing chronologically - but
seeing how Dr. Harleen Quinzel turned into

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.720
Harley Quinn in a little more detail would
undoubtedly be interesting.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.210
Her Classic Costume
In the Suicide Squad movie, Harley Quinn did

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.200
wear a costume reminiscent of the more recent
comic books in which she has appeared, but

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.210
fans of the character would really like to
see her wearing her more iconic and classic

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.390
jester costume on screen.It was briefly shown
in the movie - in the scene when the members

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.340
of the titular team were choosing their accessories
for their mission - but Margot Robbie's character

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.439
didn't wear it.

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.640
However, the fact that it has been shown to
exist in the DCEU means we're really expecting

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.080
her to don it at some point - and her solo
movie is the most obvious platform of opportunity

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.120
to make that happen.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.421
Her Classic Weapon
Like her costume in the movie, Suicide Squad

00:01:42.421 --> 00:01:45.210
didn't depict Harley Quinn with her most iconic
weapon.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.100
She mainly used a baseball bat - something
she has used in the comic books - but we'd

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.340
really like to see her wielding her classic
giant mallet.It was shown on screen - in the

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.180
same scene that her classic jester costume
was shown, when she was choosing her accessories

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.090
for the mission - but she didn't use it at
all.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.200
In her solo movie, it would be great to see
her beating the hell out of her opponents

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.840
with her most recognisable weapon from the
comic books.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.810
An R-Rating
Suicide Squad was rated PG-13 and - in spite

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.200
of the fact that it was nowhere near as bad
as some critics would have you believe - it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.750
definitely suffered from it.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.020
A PG-13 rating is something that the Harley
Quinn solo movie should definitely stay away

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.130
from.It should be rated R, like Deadpool was
- because, if that movie proved anything,

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.769
it's that rated R comic book movies can be
awesome.

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.980
Due to Harley's very nature, her movie would
benefit greatly from it, as it could push

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.389
the boundaries in terms of its violence, its
craziness and its humour - three things that

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:36.200
the character is absolutely all about.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.160
The Joker
Harley Quinn's movie should definitely focus

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.700
mainly on her - and it could be argued that
bringing in other characters with huge personalities

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.250
could be detrimental to its charm - but there's
no way a Harley Quinn movie should ever be

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.900
made without an appearance from The Joker.Not
only is the Clown Prince of Gotham synonymous

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.750
with Harley, but we also didn't see anywhere
near enough of Jared Leto's version of the

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.200
character in Suicide Squad - and any opportunity
to see more of what that version is all about

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.290
would be welcomed by most fans (and by Jared
Leto himself, of course).

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.410
Barbara Gordon
We're yet to see a comic book movie in which

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.690
both the protagonist and antagonist are female
- which is absolutely crazy when you think

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
about it - but the Harley Quinn solo movie
could very easily rectify that by having Barbara

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.650
Gordon going up against the most unpredictable
member of the Suicide Squad.Whether it was

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.380
in her Batgirl guise or her Oracle guise - both
of which would make for very interesting dynamics

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.560
in the movie - it would be awesome and extremely
refreshing for the comic book movie genre

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.640
to see a Quinn versus Gordon face-off in live
action.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.100
Batman
Having just stated that Barbara Gordon should

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.860
be the hero going up against Harley Quinn
in the latter's solo movie, you're probably

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.140
wondering what Batman is doing on this list.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.790
But, come on man, you can't have a Harley
movie without the character who enabled her

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.320
to exist in the first place.Harley was introduced
in Batman: The Animated Series and has lived

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.760
in his world ever since.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.579
Their relationship is an interesting one.

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:58.480
Although they're classically foes, there's
clearly sexual tension between the pair and

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.600
that would be interesting to see explored.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.260
Moreover, getting to see Ben Affleck's Batman
on screen again should be okay in everybody's

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.720
book - he's awesome.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.250
Poison Ivy
As of June 2015, a new lover stepped into

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.220
Harley Quinn's life on the page of DC Comics
- none other than the sexy and sultry Batman

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:18.609
villain known as Poison Ivy.

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.690
And wouldn't that be cool to explore in live
action on the big screen?!After the pair first

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.680
got together, DC's Twitter account officially
announced the relationship by saying that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.270
the pair were "girlfriends without the jealousy
of monogamy".

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.880
And, let's face it, very few people (especially
of the male variety) would complain about

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.470
seeing Margot Robbie getting down with another
beautiful actress.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.730
Some Group Banter
In the Suicide Squad movie, Margot Robbie's

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:45.070
Harley Quinn absolutely thrived when surrounded
by the rest of her titular team - especially

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.480
Will Smith's Deadshot.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.790
With that in mind, it would be cool to see
her - at least briefly - interacting with

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:54.370
a large group of characters in her solo movie.Whether
she pays a visit to her former prison buddies

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.140
and team mates, or whether she ends the movie
as part of another group such as the Birds

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.620
of Prey or Gotham City Sirens, Harley needs
an audience to play up to in order to be at

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:03.620
her best.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.890
Hopefully she'll get that opportunity, in
spite of the inherent nature of a solo movie

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.870
- in fact, DC and Warner Brothers have actually
stated that there will be a large cast of

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.710
supporting characters already, so this is
a distinct possibility.

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.650
Easter Eggs &amp; References Galore
Harley Quinn is such an interesting and wacky

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.620
character with such a rich history - albeit
a brief one in comic book terms - that all

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.590
kinds of awesome Easter eggs and references
could be included in her solo movie.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.750
That's exactly what we want to see happen.For
instance, a reference to Batman: The Animated

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.030
Series - the show in which the character first
appeared - would be very cool to see, as would

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:38.120
links and references to other characters she
has associated with in various ways, like

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.890
Power Girl, Holly Robinson, Nightwing and
the Ventriloquist.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.980
Essentially, Harley's movie could be used
to potentially expand the DCEU in many different

00:05:45.980 --> 00:06:04.140
ways, with some of the quirkiest Easter eggs
in comic book movie history.

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.030
