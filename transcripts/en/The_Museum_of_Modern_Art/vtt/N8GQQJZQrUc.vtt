00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.208
Viscosity is the thickness of any fluid

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:05.974
and in paint, high
viscosity or viscos paint,

00:00:05.974 --> 00:00:07.500
comes straight out of the tube.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.000
In fact, it has the consistency
of toothpaste as you can see.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.791
One way to decrease the viscosity of paint

00:00:14.791 --> 00:00:20.892
is to add linseed oil to it.

00:00:21.016 --> 00:00:23.804
Another way to decrease the
viscosity of oil paint is

00:00:23.804 --> 00:00:31.792
to add solvent and in
this case, turpentine.

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:34.711
And another way to use
low viscosity paint,

00:00:34.711 --> 00:00:36.838
is to simply paint with an enamel paint,

00:00:36.838 --> 00:00:40.829
which in the can is already prepared with

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.959
a very low viscosity.
