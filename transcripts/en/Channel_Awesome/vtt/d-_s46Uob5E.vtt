♫ Channel Awesome theme ♫

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:15.960
♫ Beauty and the Beast-style music ♫

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.560
♫ Tale as old as time ♫

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.720
♫ Stale as it can be ♫

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.680
♫ Recycled and tame ♫

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.000
♫ So much more the same ♫

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.440
♫ Unfortunately ♫

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.120
♫ Maybe just a change ♫

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
♫ Singers that aren't fake ♫

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.700
♫ But the suits are scared ♫

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.840
♫ No one is prepared ♫

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.840
♫ Disney's bland remake ♫

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.320
♫ All of it's the same ♫

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.800
♫ Never a surprise ♫

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.800
♫ But you'll watch it all ♫

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.140
♫ 'Cause Disney's got your balls ♫

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.160
♫ At the critics' side ♫

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.100
♫ Even what is new ♫

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.040
♫ Makes no freakin' sense ♫

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.820
♫ Really goddamn odd ♫

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.920
♫ The film viewers forgot ♫

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.620
♫ What wasn't half as dense ♫

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.320
♫ Certain as the cash ♫

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.720
♫ The studio will rake ♫

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.980
♫ Hear a second time ♫

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.020
♫ Songs played for rewind ♫

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.260
♫ Disney's bland remake ♫

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.460
♫ Who cares if it blows? ♫

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.720
♫ We're rolling in the dough ♫

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.200
♫ Disney's bland remake ♫

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:52.800
Oh, well, that's, uh...

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.260
Oh, wow.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:25.140
♫ Nostalgia Critic theme song ♫

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.320
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.320
I remember it so you don't have to.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.200
And welcome to the final installment of

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.360
Disney Live Action Remake Month.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:42.120
emotionless humming [la... la la la laaaaa  -ugh- la la la la laa]

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.320
For the final one, let's talk about one of Disney's most beloved animated films,

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.240
if not their most beloved animated film, Beauty and the Beast.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.160
With its amazing animation, stunning music, and unforgettable characters,

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.520
it received a standing ovation at the New York Film Festival,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.140
was the first animated movie to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar,

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.620
and is regarded by many to be one of the best animated movies ever, if not the best.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.320
Yeah, remake that shit.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.760
The story of Beauty and the Beast has been told countless times.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.240
They range from quick children's cash-ins to unbelievably adult and mature

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.800
to quick children's cash-ins.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.060
Despite it making a boat-load of cash, audiences seem split on this remake.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.700
Some say it just told the same story minus the fresh take and joy,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.280
others say it's a charming that captures the magic of the original.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:36.460
I say..

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.680
you´re full of shit-knocks.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.960
Is there any wiggle room for those purists that love the original so much?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.440
There's a lot to talk about, so let's get right to it.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.720
This is the live-action remake of Beauty and the Beast.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.020
Oh look, they changed the logo again.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.040
Remember when that used to be clever and unique?

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.320
Even the slight changes to the Disney format are becoming formulaic.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.140
As before, we get a backstory about a selfish prince

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.920
who threw parties for only the most beautiful people in white bed sheets.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.340
Madame de Garderobe: ♫ Oh, how divine ♫

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.020
♫ Glamour, music, and magic combine ♫

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:11.060
NC: Wow. That singing is beautif-

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.040
Don't get used to it.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.000
Ever as before, literally line for line,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.860
an old woman knocks on the door and asks for shelter,

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.820
offering him a single rose as payment.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.040
Enchantress: But she warned him not to be deceived by appearances.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.800
When he dismissed her again, the old-

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.540
NC: But he didn't dismiss her again.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.420
She just started glowing and he backed off.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.960
Literally, a stained glass window is being more consistent than you right now.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.800
As punishment, she transformed him into a hideous beast.

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.760
Like, seriously, the CGI on him was hideous.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.380
Enchantress: The prince and his servants were forgotten by the world,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.260
for the enchantress had erased all memory of them.

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.800
NC: Yes, that's how we handled that plot hole.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.640
But fear not, we will create many more to confuse you.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.280
The title is shown just like in the last film,

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.380
Belle's home is shown just like in the last film,

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.500
and the same song with the same angelic voice is sung,

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.600
just like in the last fi-

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.500
Belle: ♫ Little town ♫

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.560
NC: Uh, ooh, yeah, note three,

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.900
you lost me after note three.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.480
Belle: ♫ Full of little people ♫

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.300
NC: And you're clearly trying not to get me back.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.460
Belle: ♫ The same old bread and rolls to sell ♫

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.740
NC: I've done a whole editorial about Emma Watson's painful auto-tuning and lack of emotion

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.600
But don't worry, the auto-tuning disappears when she talks.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.260
The lack of emotion, on the other hand...

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.360
Belle: I didn't want to come back.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.020
Have you got any new places to go?

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.860
NC: Actually, maybe her whole performance is auto-tuned.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.820
Belle: ♫ There must be more than ♫

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.420
NC: Dah duh duh okay, no more auto-tuning.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.900
Christ, you sound like Stephen Hawking's voice box.

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.340
So Belle is not only a bookworm, but the only bookworm in town...

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.400
Père Robert: If it isn't the only bookworm in town!

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.180
NC: I'm so glad they decided to humanize her with more faults.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.220
But even that's not impressive as there's only twelve books in this library-slash-church...?

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.480
That's like saying you're a movie buff if you've only seen eight films

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.180
and they're all Pure Flix.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.100
Belle: ♫ Ooohhh ♫

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.360
NC: Yah, okay, I'll buy it, just stop singing.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.700
Sound like Tina from Bob's Burgers.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.660
Belle/Tina: ♫ Ooohhh ♫ / Uuuhhhhh

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.660
NC: Of course, we see the handsome Gaston has the hots for Belle,

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.280
having just returned from battle.

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.340
Gaston: Ever since the war, I've felt like I've been missing something.

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:13.560
NC: This creative choice adds a lot to his story and character because...

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.100
I dunno, it's something different.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:18.300
Something you'll notice very quickly

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.440
is while the song numbers clearly have a lot of work put in to them,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.580
they still somehow seem slow and lifeless.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.020
Belle/Townsfolk: ♫ Good day/Mais oui/You call this bacon?/What lovely flowers ♫

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.660
Townsfolk/Gaston: ♫ Some cheese/Ten yards!/One pound/Excuse me/I'll get the knife♫

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:32.460
NC: The original has the advantage of being animated,

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.080
it can exaggerate everything and get the timing perfect,

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:36.980
practically leaping off the screen.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.700
But still, why does it seem like there's so little energy here?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.180
Original Townsmen: ♫ Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar ♫

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.160
Remake Townsmen: ♫ Look there she goes, that girl is so peculiar ♫

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.040
NC: Well, if I can borrow from another terrible cinematic musical...

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.380
As bad as Greatest Showman got, it still was quite a spectacle when it came to the musical numbers.

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.360
This is because not only is the movement keeping the energy up,

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.920
but so are the camera angles, the editing, and what's being focused on.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.920
The majority of beats in every song have something visual keeping you connected to it.

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.340
♫...go?/Where it's covered in all the colored lights ♫

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.240
♫ We light it up, we won't come down ♫

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.340
NC: This is just people walking around,

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.320
and it's shot, edited, and feels like people just walking around.

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.120
Townsfolk: ♫ Look there she goes, that girl is strange but special ♫

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.160
♫ A most peculiar mademoiselle ♫

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.520
NC: Also, Belle is the only one who wore blue in the original, helping her stand out.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.140
Here?

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.400
Who gives a shit, she's from Harry Potter, that's interesting enough.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.680
Wonderful book you have there.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.400
Belle: Have you read it?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.420
Gaston: Uh well, not that one, but you know, books...

00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.460
NC: Much like the script, I didn't read it.

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.040
Look out! The one good scene in the movie!

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.120
Maurice: ♫ How does a moment last forever? ♫

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:53.440
♫ How can a story never die?♫

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.960
NC: I'm serious, this addition, though not sung very well,

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.800
is filled with so much heart and emotion.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.500
In this one scene, through lyrics, paintings, and expressions,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.980
we know who he's singing about and what she meant to our leads

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.140
without specifically addressing her.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.220
Belle: Please, just tell me one more thing about her.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.500
NC: Except when they do.

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.100
Belle: Papa, do you think I'm odd?

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:14.460
Maurice: Odd?

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.540
NC: You were forgettably bland, odd would be a step up.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:22.560
Maurice: Back in Paris, I knew a girl like you who was so... different.

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:23.840
People mocked her.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.000
Belle: Please, just tell me one more thing about her.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.200
Maurice: Your mother was...

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:30.280
NC: Say it, say it...

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.180
Maurice: Fearless.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.440
NC: Odd!

00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.200
It should've been odd!

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.920
He said how much he admires uniqueness

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.880
and how being odd isn't bad.

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.680
My heart was *this* close to melting and what did you go with?

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:44.500
Maurice: Fearless.

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.540
Heart: Oh wow, I'm instantly gonna forget about this scene.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.440
NC: Right?!

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.440
Maurice: So...

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.160
What can I bring you from the market?

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.280
NC: The market? In the original, it was the fair.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.520
She was just at the market!

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.120
Why the hell are you traveling a great distance for what's literally in your front yard?

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.480
Is it Wal-Market? Are the prices so good they're worth traveling for?

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.120
Belle: A rose, like the one in the painting.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.840
Maurice: You ask for that every year.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.940
NC: Okay, bring me a hairy CGI man with a rose, if we wanna hammer this in.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.600
And so, to add even more dimension to humanizing Belle,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.700
she apparently invents the washing machine.

00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.820
Yeah, that's a thing.

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:18.900
Village Lass: What are you doing?

00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:19.560
Belle: Laundry.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.900
NC: Wow, Belle really is Jesus!

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.400
In that Jesus invented the chair,

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.340
clearly established in "The Passion."

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.820
Aren't these two popular enough you don't have to have them invent shit?

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:35.960
Now in the original, Belle is seen as odd because she's a bookworm that keeps to herself.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.500
But seeing how that was the kid's version and this one wants to be more adult,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.080
let's spell it out even more!

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.200
Nasty Headmaster: What on Earth are you doing?

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.780
Teaching another girl to read?

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.540
Isn't one enough?

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:47.940
Clothilde: We have to do something.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.280
NC:  I'm gonna write up a plan to get her back,

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:51.920
that is, if I knew how to read or write.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.200
They do have an evil plan, though -

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.080
they knock over her washing machine!

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:59.480
And it's really not shot like a big deal,

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.080
it's only a few seconds, they don't even focus on her looking angry.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.700
I actually feel more sorry for this guy,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.440
the attention seems to be focused on him.

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:08.380
When will people just let women use washing machines?!

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.720
My God, that sounds sexist, Beauty and the Beast.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.260
Gaston approaches Belle and suggests they become an item,

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.500
but Belle turns down his wedding proposal despite him never giving a wedding proposal.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.940
Gaston: Some of us have changed.

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:21.860
Belle: I'm never going to marry you, Gaston.

00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:22.900
I'm sorry.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.940
NC: Now, of course, in the original we see the beginnings of Gaston's cruel nature

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.060
and Belle's frustration reaching her peak.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:30.400
Here it's...

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.140
just another scene.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.660
Yeah, look at how angry he looks in the original.

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:36.440
He says Belle's going to be his wife,

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:40.980
he marches off super angry after getting this whole big wedding proposal thing put together;

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.120
Here, there's none of that.

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.000
He looks more like,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.340
"I'm in the mood for nachos, mmm maybe pizza, no, nachos!"

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.600
Belle even goes into her big "Madame Gaston" song

00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:50.540
and it doesn't feel warranted.

00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.660
You see, time passed in the original,

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:56.240
so you can feel the emotions rising even when they're not onscreen.

00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.000
It also allowed for a location change

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.780
so you're not getting tired of looking at the same place for too long.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.400
But in this order, not only are we stuck in the village for longer than we need to be,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:08.060
but Belle just comes across as bland whining after bland whining.

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.200
There's no break from it.

00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:14.580
Belle: ♫ I want adventure in the great wide somewhere ♫

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:16.560
NC: Yeah, along with your mother back,

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:17.900
your father talking about her more,

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.780
girls reading,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:20.040
patenting your washing machine,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:20.840
a rose,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.220
Gaston not asking you to marry him even though he didn't ask you to marry him.

00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.520
A word of advice,

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.600
don't smile when you're singing what you're frustrated about.

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:28.980
I'd say that's child actor stuff,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.060
but you were a child actor!

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.320
Belle's father gets lost on his way to presumably the greatest market in the world,

00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:37.020
and stumbles across the Beast's castle.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:39.480
He finds it's filled with all sorts of nightmare utensils,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.420
oh, I mean, charming little friends,

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.660
as he's intimidated by the place and escapes.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.400
Maurice: Wait, wait, wait, roses.

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.420
I nearly forgot.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:47.560
I promised Belle a rose.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.140
NC: I mean, sure this place is haunted and I was fleeing for my life,

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.520
but a rose! When am I gonna come across that?

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:54.580
The Beast captures the father though,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.100
as the horse goes back to Belle and she demands that she's taken to him.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.560
Pleasant weather, then horrendous winter?

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:05.860
I must be in Chicago!

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.220
Such a wide range of expression from Watson, isn't it?

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.140
In the animated one, she holds her father's belonging close to her and looks worried.

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.520
Here, she doesn't even glance at the damn thing,

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.780
it just looks like she's been asked a hard math question.

00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:25.000
"What's the square root of 329? Ohhh..."

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:27.840
It gets even better when she finds her father locked up

00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:28.940
and the Beast confronts her.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.660
The film takes what was an emotional moment of fear and discovery

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.080
and almost fast forwards through it.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.540
Look at the time it takes for every character to come to their decision.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.080
Belle has to think before offering up her life,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.320
Beast has to think before realizing he may have a way out of his damnation.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.740
The reveal of him is slow,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:47.420
letting her reaction sink in to what she's about to do.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.460
But that movie was an hour and a half

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:51.720
and this is but a mere two hours, ten minutes,

00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:53.460
we gotta bullet point this shit!

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:54.740
Quickly offering up her life,

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:55.940
Belle: Punish me, not him!

00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:56.600
*ding* Check.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.660
Quickly revealing the Beast.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:58.420
*ding* Check.

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:00.280
Quickly having Beast realize what this could mean-

00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.600
Oh, we didn't even have time for that.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.900
Okay, whatever, emotions are secondary in a romance.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:08.200
Why else would they show Beast and Belle together as little as possible?

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:09.360
Not even kidding.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.220
Remember when the Beast sees her crying and feels bad

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:15.920
and then decides to give her a nicer room while also being domineering?

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:18.520
How he's trying to be sympathetic, showing some emotion,

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:21.180
but losing it again when he brings up the West Wing,

00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.980
establishing a mysterious connection to it?

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.320
*deep breath*

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:27.860
Going back and forth establishing what a tortured character he is,

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:31.540
trying to be kind but he's too filled up with anger from years of isolation?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.500
*deep breath*

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.760
Making Belle's environment all the more uncertain and frightening?

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.120
Making the danger, fear, and captivity feel all the more real?

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:40.720
All gone!

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:42.560
Yes, really.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.800
Now, it's Cogsworth and Lumière doing all that

00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.240
because they didn't give them much time earlier

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.520
for whatever reason.

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.080
We don't even have a breakdown from Belle

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.860
realizing the sacrifice she made.

00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:55.000
She just walks blandly through the palace

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.560
with no fear, no intimidation, no nothing.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:59.240
Oh, but don't worry though,

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.860
the Beast is even less interesting.

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:04.160
Even taking away how distracting his CGI is,

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.620
even though it *originally* was going to be makeup,

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.520
it's like Superman's CGI upper lip -

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.240
except it's the whole thing!

00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.460
But listen to this line from the original:

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.040
Lumière: Have you thought that perhaps this girl could be the one to break the spell?

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:17.320
Beast: Of course I have!

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.640
I'm not a fool.

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:20.880
Well, guess who god damn is?

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.500
Beast: She's the daughter of a common thief!

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.020
This Beast hates that she's in a nicer room,

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.360
roaming around the castle,

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:31.800
and has to be told that she's the one that could possibly break the spell.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.580
Beast: You're making her dinner?!

00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:34.720
You gave her a bedroom?!

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.580
It's the most ridiculous idea I've ever heard!

00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.080
Charm the prisoner!

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.140
NC: Okay, look, the other Beast is a brute,

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:44.360
but he still has some connection to an emotional, intelligent human being.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.180
That's what Belle has to discover.

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:47.740
This one's just a dumbass.

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:49.680
He's not intriguing, he's not smart,

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:50.720
there's no sympathy,

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.560
so there's no relating to him.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.220
Between both their lack of being invested in anything,

00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:57.520
I think the real couple I want to see get together in this

00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.260
is these two.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:06.080
♫ Nostalgia Critic short outro music ♫

00:15:09.580 --> 00:15:13.840
♫ Nostalgia Critic short intro music ♫

00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:16.380
NC: So a mere forty-three minutes in

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.240
and we're finally introduced to Mrs. Potts,

00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.400
God, I love how this movie is structured,

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:23.500
as we're given, frankly, a confusing connection

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:25.860
between the credenza and the wardrobe.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.920
Lumière: Maestro, your wife is upstairs,

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.480
finding it harder and harder to stay awake.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:33.340
She's counting on you to help us break this curse!

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:36.780
NC: Literally, that one line is the only thing that shows

00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:39.040
those two characters have a relationship.

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.980
Do *you* follow it?

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:43.980
Why is she tired?

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:45.800
What does it mean that she's tired?

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.080
Why is she upstairs?

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.840
Don't they see each other or talk to each other at all?

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:52.940
The place is big enough that they could work out something.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.600
We see her come to the balcony,

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.240
and the stairs seem big enough to support either of them.

00:15:57.240 --> 00:15:59.200
Why don't they see each other at all?

00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.940
You know, I already have one romance with a ton of plot holes I don't care about,

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:03.240
don't try to shoehorn in another.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.260
Belle is shown the dining room

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.400
and we partake, of course, in the big showstopper,

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.420
"Be Our Guest."

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:12.400
Lumière: ♫ As the dining room proudly presents- ♫

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:13.680
NC: Our leftovers.

00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.100
In every meaning of the word.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.400
The music number is honestly okay,

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.960
despite Ewan McGregor as Lumière is something like

00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.920
a drunk Pepé Le Pew -

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.260
Lumière: ♫ Go on, unfold your menu, take a glance and then ♫

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:28.380
♫ You'll be our guest! ♫

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.520
NC: But because there's no real fear or danger built up,

00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.400
this doesn't feel as much as levity as much as obligation.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:39.320
We're not doing this to lift the emotional intensity Belle has gone through,

00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.640
because, you know, that would require an emotion out of Belle,

00:16:42.540 --> 00:16:46.640
they're doing it because it'd be crazy not to do a song this popular.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.960
Plus, more creepy teapot faces.

00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:54.940
Am I gonna drink out of you

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:57.040
or are you gonna drink out of me?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.120
It even ends kind of awkward.

00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.840
Lumière: Pudding?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:01.260
Belle: *nervous laugh*

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:04.460
Belle: I don't understand why you're all being so kind to me.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.520
Surely you're as trapped here as I am.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.760
NC: Why did you need that weird cut?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.260
In the original, she says

00:17:09.260 --> 00:17:11.300
"That was great, why don't we look around the castle?"

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:12.600
It was an easy segue.

00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.220
It would've been easy to have that before she walks

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.920
through the rooms of sculpted tentacle porn to the West Wing.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.400
*gasp* Oh my God, it...

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.220
looks just like the other rooms.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.340
I mean, come on, you remember how destroyed that room looked in the original?

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:30.180
It was kinda like,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:31.620
Whoa, what happened in here?

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.980
But because the rest of the castle already looks like architectural clutter,

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.420
this isn't the least bit jarring.

00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:38.020
I dare even say,

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:40.480
the West Wing looks nicer than the other rooms in the castle.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:41.780
Dibs on the West Wing!

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:42.960
But look out!

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.060
An angry Beast with hastily rushed lines!

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.780
Beast: What are you doing here?!

00:17:47.020 --> 00:17:48.140
What did you do to it?!

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:48.960
Belle: Nothing!

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.540
Beast: Do you realize what you could've done?

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.060
You could've damned us all!

00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:52.960
Get out of here!

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:54.160
NC: Seven seconds.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.080
From him appearing to her leaving,

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:57.300
seven seconds.

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.780
Don't get me wrong, the original wasn't that long either,

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:02.100
but, look, they're absorbing their actions,

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:03.400
taking their time.

00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.720
What they say and do actually has weight to it,

00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:09.280
amounting to at least a bare minimum of thirty seconds.

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.260
That's over double the time of this one!

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.240
You'd think in a longer film, they could've expanded on that,

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.740
but no, they actually make it go quicker!

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:18.980
Freakin' quicker!

00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:23.240
How does this film somehow go faster AND slower at the same time?!

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.500
As you'd guess, Belle is cornered by wolves

00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:26.580
and the Beast saves her.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:28.960
Belle's incredibly emotional animation is now replaced

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.240
by a glance down.

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.640
Oh, be careful, that was a whole facial muscle

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:33.680
you just used there!

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.460
As we cut to, well, something new, at least.

00:18:36.460 --> 00:18:38.500
Gaston trying to help Maurice find Belle.

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:40.100
Gaston: Where is Belle?

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:42.280
Maurice: A beast took her and she -

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.480
Gaston: There are no such things as beasts.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:45.080
NC: I'll just be honest,

00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:47.740
I'm not entirely sure what Gaston's endgame is here.

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.660
He didn't believe Maurice,

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.840
so why did he think he would find Belle?

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.460
Did he even believe she was gone and not at home?

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:55.940
Maybe he's just trying to get friendly with-

00:18:55.940 --> 00:18:57.360
Gaston: I will feed you to the wolves!

00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:58.080
NC: Or maybe not.

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:01.480
Gaston: That's no way to talk to my future father-in-law now, is it?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.020
Maurice: You will never marry my daughter.

00:19:06.280 --> 00:19:07.660
NC: Now kindly help me find her,

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:09.080
you clearly well-balanced human being-

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.100
oh, down I go.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:13.600
So Gaston goes from zero to murder pretty quick,

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:15.460
leaving Maurice to be eaten by the wolves.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:18.300
The town begger finds him later and nurses him back to health.

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.820
I'm not entirely sure where this is all going,

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.580
but I'll wait it out to be disappointed.

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.300
Meanwhile, Belle tends to the Beast's wounds,

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.460
as the servants admit they were cursed too

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.960
because they didn't help when the Beast's mean father

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:31.220
made him so foul.

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:35.040
Mrs. Potts: And his cruel father took that sweet innocent lad

00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.300
and twisted him up to be just like him.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.480
We did nothing.

00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.960
NC: We'll, of course, never see any of that,

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:43.400
apart from this pointless flashback of his mother dying,

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.340
but it's okay, the more we don't show the Beauty and the Beast

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.540
interacting in a movie called Beauty and the Beast,

00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:49.920
the more things will fall into place.

00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.240
Belle: "...with the eyes but with the mind.

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:55.060
Belle/Beast: And therefore is winged Cupid-"

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.160
NC: Oh yeah, now we're ten in,

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.240
I guess we can start having some chemistry now.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.300
The other film would only have twenty minutes left.

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:02.640
Belle: Romeo and Juliet is my favorite play.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.000
Beast: So many better things to read.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:04.600
Belle: Like what?

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.780
Beast: There are a couple things in here you could start with.

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:11.300
NC: Oh, yeah, so the Beast doesn't give Belle the library

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:13.760
to show his thanks and that he understands something she loves,

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.420
he just accidentally shows it off trying to get her mind off romance.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.040
Soo much better!

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.240
Oh, and here's an interesting addition-

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.020
Belle: What happens when the last petal falls?

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:23.700
Lumière: We become-

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:24.480
Mrs. Potts: Antiques.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:25.000
Cogsworth: Rubbish.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.580
NC: Yeah, if the spell is broken, they don't stay that way,

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:31.360
they become actual inanimate objects.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.920
*blows air*

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.880
So...

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.660
I hate to keep saying this, but, um,

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:40.700
in the goddamn original,

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:43.020
when they're doing the song numbers and being friendly,

00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:45.340
there's an underlying fear that they'll stay that way,

00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:47.700
but they at least have been like that for years;

00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:48.840
they can survive.

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.900
Here, they will LITERALLY DIE.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.580
Why the freakin' hell are you singing and dancing?

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:57.660
In fact, isn't Belle kind of selfish knowing this could be their last days

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.780
and she's just bonking up with the Beast?

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.980
Shouldn't everyone be in an awkward position right now?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.520
"Lumière": Belle, what is wrong?

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:08.960
"Belle": I'm sorry, I just can't focus on romance right now

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.700
when this could be your last night alive.

00:21:11.420 --> 00:21:13.580
"Lumière": Oh, but we are happy to serve you.

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:15.680
There is no pressure to fall in love with the Beast.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:16.280
"Belle": What?

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.720
"Lumière": Oh. Nothing! I didn't say anything. Oh God, what have I done?

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.660
"Belle": Huh, falling in love with the Beast will break the curse?

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.660
"Lumière": But you're not supposed to know that or it's less likely to happen!

00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:27.660
"Belle": No, no... no, that's fine.

00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:29.120
I'm glad you told me.

00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:32.400
I'm just gonna go fall in love with him and not think about it at all.

00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:34.720
"Lumière": But the knowledge is just going to get in the way!

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.760
"Belle": No! I'm sure I can make this work.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:37.620
I'll totally, I'll make it work.

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.040
You're right, I can't make this work, it's all I can think about!

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:45.860
"Lumière": Oh God, why did I have to tell you?!

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:47.780
"Belle": I just can't get my mind off of it now!

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:51.000
"Lumière": I don't even know where the soul of a candlestick goes!

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.400
Do I have an afterlife or do I just...

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:54.480
Just...

00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.660
Oh God!

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.960
"Belle": Uh, okay, I'm gonna go invent the toaster or something,

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.260
I'm so sorry I couldn't help.

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:04.820
"Lumière": Where does the soul of a candlestick go?

00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:11.100
Where does the soul of a candlestick go?!

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.480
NC: We do get a legit nice moment with them talking on a bridge

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.060
followed by a weird-as-hell moment

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:19.240
of her getting sucker punched by a snowball.

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:27.600
But we're given yet another odd addition of finding out

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.840
that the Beast has a book that can literally,

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:32.740
and I guess literarily, take him anywhere.

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:34.600
What?

00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:37.080
Beast: A book that truly allows you to escape.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.720
The outside world has no place for a creature like me,

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.720
but it can for you.

00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.460
NC: So when I'm asleep and you want to escape,

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.620
you totally can.

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:49.160
We just made this even more of a Stockholm movie!

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.860
They use it to see where Belle's mother died -

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.160
- always a romantic spot -

00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:55.460
- and they never used it again.

00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.400
*sigh* You know, wasn't that the idea of the mirror?

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.160
The only window to the outside world?

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:03.280
Now that window turned into a goddamn United Air flight!

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.220
True, they don't treat dogs well and that could be an issue,

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:07.640
but I think you can still go places where there's little to no people.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:09.400
Isolation, my ass!

00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.480
I'll gladly get turned into a beast

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.320
if it means I can literally go anywhere in the world!

00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:14.160
But nope!

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:16.460
Let's stay here and awkwardly do our ballroom scene

00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.960
that feels more like two third graders being forced to hold hands.

00:23:19.220 --> 00:23:21.380
Yeah, this scene was pretty romantically laid out in the original, wasn't it?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.440
They make a whole evening out of it,

00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:24.760
they eat at a table,

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:26.440
he learned how to use a spoon,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.980
she gets the idea to go dance,

00:23:27.980 --> 00:23:30.200
but he's nervous because he clearly doesn't know how,

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:32.000
so she teaches him,

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:34.000
and they both become comfortable in each other's arms,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:34.960
it feels real.

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.740
It built up to this lovely moment and it feels genuine.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:39.380
Again,

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:40.640
all skipped!

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:42.440
Just go straight to the ballroom!

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.220
Go down the stairs, turn right,

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.680
that's all people really want to see,

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:48.300
just the image, not anything that led up to it.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.140
How was this even proposed?

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:51.800
If you're not doing anything tonight,

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.420
I was hoping we could just go to the ballroom,

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:55.400
dance for exactly two minutes,

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.880
and stare blankly at each other.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.520
But it'll lead to this shot!

00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:03.040
That means we're in love now.

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:04.960
Great plan, by the way,

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:08.180
to have currently one of the greatest living singers in your movie

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.480
and have Emma Thompson sing your big song.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.060
Mrs. Potts: ♫ As the sun will rise ♫

00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.020
NC:  I'm sure McDonald couldn't top that-

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:21.260
McDonald: ♫ Climb ev'ry mountain ♫

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.220
NC:  God, you're a bad movie!

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:25.580
Belle sees through the mirror, though,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.340
that Gaston is having her father locked up.

00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:29.420
Not to get Belle to marry him,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.480
but just to cover his tracks for trying to kill him.

00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.440
That is so much better-

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:34.060
wait, that's bullshit.

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:34.820
It's bullshit!

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.240
Belle: He's in trouble!

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.280
Beast: Then you must go to him.

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.120
NC: Wow.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.260
Again, barely even thought about it.

00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:44.520
This is actually kind of amazing.

00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.920
Look at the same scene in the good movie -

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:48.440
he was told he was dying,

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:49.960
he looks at the rose,

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.060
thinks for a moment,

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.240
on the verge of tears, he then tells her she can go.

00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.900
He realizes what he's giving up,

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:57.360
but he loves her so much,

00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:58.920
he's willing to make the sacrifice.

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:00.840
This sounds more like an office favor.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.220
Hey, I need a digital copy of this,

00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:04.300
and Frank is the only one with a scanner.

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.200
Beast: Then you must go to him.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.800
NC: Okay, I'll CC you on this.

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.320
Beast: You must go to him.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:09.800
No time to waste.

00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.800
NC: And that's why I'm having you go on horseback

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.840
and not the magic book that can take you anywhere

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:15.920
and bring him right back, easily solving two problems.

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.300
But then we couldn't have the "gimme Oscar" song!

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.740
Beast: ♫ Now I know she'll never leave me ♫

00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:24.720
NC: Kind of ironic,

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.200
seeing as how Disney stole the Oscar from Disney.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.260
The song itself is okay,

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:30.060
despite it not being very well sung,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.480
and I'll even give credit to the "Kill the Beast" song

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.180
after Belle convinces everyone the Beast is real.

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.720
Gaston: ♫ Hear him roar, see him foam ♫

00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.640
♫ But we're not coming home 'til he's dead ♫

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.780
NC: It's well edited, well shot,

00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:42.180
and keeps the energy very high...

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:44.140
for the first half.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.900
Gaston: ♫ Call it war, call it threat ♫

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:47.680
♫ You can bet they all will follow ♫

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.760
NC: Yeah, slow horseback riding!

00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:50.820
I am so amped right now! Mmmm!

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:53.760
The climax is pretty standard with comedic slapstick

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.200
leading up to the showdown

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.160
between the Beast and Gaston.

00:25:56.700 --> 00:25:57.700
Belle, of course, arrives,

00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.640
giving him the courage to fight back.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:01.460
Gaston: Don't let me, Beast.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:06.320
Beast: I am not a beast.

00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.300
NC: Granted, I have no other name in this,

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:09.860
even the woman I love calls me Beast,

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:12.080
but, I just don't like the way you say it.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.540
Gaston gets one last shot before falling to his death,

00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.000
the living objects are turned into inanimate objects,

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.440
and Belle confesses her love in...

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.420
front of the enchantress?

00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:30.640
That's right!

00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:33.660
The beggar woman was the enchantress the whole time!

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.640
And on top of transforming the Beast

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:37.220
and everyone back to normal,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.340
well, mostly normal, this blink is weird,

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.640
What?

00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.300
She also gives the townspeople back their memories.

00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.160
Oh yeah, it looks like some of them

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.100
had friends and family in that castle

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.760
that she kept separated for years and years.

00:26:51.660 --> 00:26:56.220
Mr. Potts: Oh Beatrice! I remember! I do! Oh!

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.600
NC: This is a goddamn messed up lady!

00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:01.800
She's gonna punish the servants with death

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:03.180
if the Beast doesn't fall in love,

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:05.340
she erased all memory of government,

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.200
kept families apart,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.480
pretty much altered this entire world,

00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.680
and for what?

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.600
So they could learn overcoming prejudice

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.980
comes down to beastly violence?

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.960
So she could let another selfish asshole ruin things

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.980
while she watches and does nothing?

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:19.460
That dude served in war too,

00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.940
why wasn't he given the Beast treatment

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.620
rather than just watching him die?

00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.420
Her secretly viewing this doesn't make her an all-knowing angel,

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:27.460
it makes her a freakin' psychopath!

00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:29.420
She's a goddamn psychopath!

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.920
This movie is messed up!

00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:33.000
But,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.620
happily ever after, I guess.

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.760
Tee hee, ha ha, everyone's so happy,

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.880
just forget the mayhem and terror that bestowed us...

00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.900
Christ.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.240
Madame de Garderobe: ♫ Tale as old as time ♫

00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.400
NC: And look, the best singer actually gets

00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.600
the finishing song-

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.960
Hup, not quite.

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.320
Mrs. Potts: ♫ Famine turns to feast ♫

00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.020
♫ Nature points the way ♫

00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:56.160
NC: Shaddup, McDonald, you've got this voice to contend with -

00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:59.760
Emma Thompson: *high-pitched gibberish sounds*

00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:02.180
NC: But she got the last note, bitches!

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.180
And that was...

00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:07.900
really hard to get through.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:12.300
The original is a classic telling of a timeless story.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.040
This is just a remake.

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.020
A remake that doesn't understand

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:17.360
what made the original story so powerful.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.760
While it's shorter and arguably simpler,

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:24.280
every choice plays a part in driving the characters' motivations.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.940
The emotions feel justified and earned.

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.480
This one just changes things that don't need to be changed,

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.560
didn't add enough to make it its own thing,

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.360
and sped up parts that needed to remain slow.

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.900
It's as if the story is still there

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:40.200
but the wrong parts are focused on.,

00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:41.800
leading to something that looks familiar

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:43.140
but feels false.

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:45.320
If you enjoy it, more power to you,

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.280
but I can tell you,

00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:49.920
this is a Beast I don't think I can ever learn to love.

00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.520
Thank you for watching Disney's Live Action Remake Month

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.420
and I gotta tell you, after seeing all these animated classics

00:28:57.420 --> 00:28:59.460
turn into these live action abominations,

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.320
I gotta see some cartoon that's put to live action

00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.420
done right.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:06.060
*Woody Woodpecker call*

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:07.760
That's not it, is it?

00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:35.640
♫ Nostalgia Critic credits music ♫

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:51.360
Belle/Tina: ♫ Ooohhh ♫ / Uuuhhhhh

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.420
Hey, Doug Walker here, doing the Charity Shoutout

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.680
and this week we are doing 2 Seconds or Less.

00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:01.880
2 Seconds or Less is an organization dedicated to

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.060
ending childhood malnutrition with its sustainable

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.240
solutions to hunger.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:08.920
They put nutrition gardens at government schools

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.380
and educate on nutrition and farming

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.120
to empower children to break the cycle of poverty

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:16.520
both at home and around the world.

00:30:16.620 --> 00:30:19.620
Growth in agriculture has at least twice the potential

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:22.800
impact of any other sector for reducing poverty

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.860
around the world.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.420
It has the ability to support livelihood through

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.680
sustainable income generation and

00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.520
holistic healthcare.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.100
Through this program's work, students learn

00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.100
that to grow up and become a farmer is not a

00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.760
desperate end, but a hopeful beginning.

00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.120
If you look at their site and their YouTube page,

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:40.960
you can see all the children being helped

00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.220
and all the people who work day and night

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.560
to make sure they have the strength and energy

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.200
they need for the future.

00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.560

00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:51.540
a small child in a big way.
