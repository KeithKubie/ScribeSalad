00:00:00.036 --> 00:00:03.206
&gt;&gt;Student: Jazmin feels like she's
going to get into a good college and--

00:00:03.916 --> 00:00:06.386
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Because we do
collaborative reading,

00:00:06.386 --> 00:00:08.846
we are helping every
scholar feel successful,

00:00:08.956 --> 00:00:11.826
regardless of the reading level.

00:00:11.826 --> 00:00:13.826
&gt;&gt;So who is it about?
&gt;&gt;Student: Jazmin.

00:00:14.496 --> 00:00:17.776
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Being able to
synthesize the big ideas,

00:00:18.246 --> 00:00:20.786
form opinions, and share those.

00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:25.186
Those are skills that any contributing
citizen of the world would need.

00:00:25.806 --> 00:00:27.476
&gt;&gt;Student: What do you think about that?

00:00:34.476 --> 00:00:36.836
&gt;&gt;Alexa: Our mission is to
create critical thinkers,

00:00:36.996 --> 00:00:40.506
children that are able to communicate
clearly their thoughts, their ideas

00:00:41.076 --> 00:00:43.396
and as a result, are
productive members of society.

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:48.416
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Collaborative reading is a
reading approach where the scholars work

00:00:48.416 --> 00:00:50.106
with one another and share ideas.

00:00:50.706 --> 00:00:55.776
&gt;&gt;Student: Little cat was
walking down the street.

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:58.506
&gt;&gt;Crystal: It's amazing
because the kids are coming

00:00:58.506 --> 00:01:01.036
in at different levels,
different learning styles.

00:01:01.176 --> 00:01:03.876
So whether you're a higher
reader or lower reader,

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:07.096
we're all going to break
it down together.

00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:08.756
&gt;&gt;Student: Why is this important?

00:01:08.896 --> 00:01:12.706
&gt;&gt;Student: Because we want to
better understand the text.

00:01:13.456 --> 00:01:14.446
&gt;&gt;Genesis: What I like most

00:01:14.516 --> 00:01:19.746
about collaborative reading is you
take all your ideas, put them together,

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.006
and make one big thought.
We all understand it.

00:01:23.006 --> 00:01:24.816
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Scholars, we're
ready for collaborative reading.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:28.126
&gt;&gt;The structure of collaborative
reading is broken into five phases.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:32.696
Each day is concentrating
on a specific skill or idea.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:37.136
&gt;&gt;Raquel: Each phase has a
question tailored to that skill

00:01:37.136 --> 00:01:39.096
that we want them to walk away with.

00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:40.596
&gt;&gt;Student: We're going to do phase one.

00:01:40.596 --> 00:01:43.556
We're going to look for the
main idea in chapter eight.

00:01:43.896 --> 00:01:46.266
&gt;&gt;Students: I went directly
to her office

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:53.006
to ask how this obvious
mistake had occurred.

00:01:53.446 --> 00:01:57.276
&gt;&gt;Mia: So the text we've been reading
is a book called Jazmin's Notebook.

00:01:57.276 --> 00:02:02.906
Jazmin wants to be a writer, Ms. Wise,
this counsellor, wants her to stay

00:02:02.906 --> 00:02:06.926
at home, clean, cook, and
to not follow her dreams.

00:02:07.526 --> 00:02:08.416
&gt;&gt;Students: -- that a person

00:02:08.416 --> 00:02:14.176
like yourself would be happier
doing something with your hands.

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:17.666
&gt;&gt;Raquel: After we read it, we go
back to what was the main idea.

00:02:17.876 --> 00:02:19.646
Because if they understand that point,

00:02:19.646 --> 00:02:21.856
then it'll be easier
for them to build on it.

00:02:22.696 --> 00:02:26.276
&gt;&gt;Student: Okay. So it's not
D. So we're stuck with B or C.

00:02:26.376 --> 00:02:29.616
&gt;&gt;Student: C says Jazmin didn't
believe she might get to college, but--

00:02:29.836 --> 00:02:31.596
&gt;&gt;Mia: We'll choose an
answer. We'll discuss it

00:02:31.596 --> 00:02:33.316
with the class to see if we agree.

00:02:33.316 --> 00:02:34.626
&gt;&gt;Student: Why do you guys think it's B?

00:02:35.556 --> 00:02:39.316
&gt;&gt;Student: The courses Ms. Wise
picked for her will be fitting

00:02:39.316 --> 00:02:41.286
for her career as a best-selling author.

00:02:41.896 --> 00:02:45.396
&gt;&gt;Student: Phase two is annotating
the text for better understanding.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:50.786
We do it chunk by chunk, and we annotate
key details that supports the gist.

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:53.586
&gt;&gt;Raquel: This gives students an
opportunity to really dissect.

00:02:53.586 --> 00:02:56.706
Some of the annotation
markings are a star

00:02:56.806 --> 00:02:59.326
if there's a section
that's really vital,

00:02:59.786 --> 00:03:03.906
arched arrows connecting
ideas, question marks.

00:03:03.906 --> 00:03:07.026
By phase three, now we're going to
go back, look at those annotations.

00:03:07.066 --> 00:03:08.606
What inferences can we make here?

00:03:09.296 --> 00:03:12.636
&gt;&gt;We're going to go back to our
text to answer some questions.

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:15.306
&gt;&gt;Student: It could be
A and it could be B.

00:03:15.376 --> 00:03:16.806
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm leaning more towards A.

00:03:16.836 --> 00:03:19.976
&gt;&gt;Does everybody have a answer?
&gt;&gt;Students: Yes.

00:03:20.716 --> 00:03:23.676
&gt;&gt;Student: Why do you guys
think it's A and not B, C, or D?

00:03:24.446 --> 00:03:26.916
&gt;&gt;Student: She thinks Jazmin
is not going to go to college.

00:03:27.076 --> 00:03:30.316
You could infer that she
doesn't believe in her.

00:03:30.716 --> 00:03:33.566
&gt;&gt;Raquel: Phase four, now, we're
looking closely at the author's craft.

00:03:33.806 --> 00:03:37.656
So what was the message that was being
conveyed with certain words or phrases?

00:03:38.056 --> 00:03:41.616
&gt;&gt;Student: Me and her annotated
that her name is very, like,

00:03:41.616 --> 00:03:44.246
ironic because she's not
that wise as her name says

00:03:44.246 --> 00:03:48.346
because Jazmin doesn't want to do
the courses she put her in to do.

00:03:48.586 --> 00:03:51.066
&gt;&gt;Raquel: Phase five is about
bringing it all together.

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:53.746
So they are thinking about a theme

00:03:53.746 --> 00:03:58.396
or drawing conclusions why the
author wrote what he wrote.

00:03:59.046 --> 00:04:05.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Summary of this excerpt would
be Ms. Wise controlling Jazmin's life.

00:04:06.306 --> 00:04:08.046
&gt;&gt;Raquel: So what goes after your claim?

00:04:08.546 --> 00:04:12.156
&gt;&gt;The way that we select texts for
collaborative reading, we look at texts

00:04:12.436 --> 00:04:15.166
that are grade level
and above grade level.

00:04:15.636 --> 00:04:20.066
So this approach is a perfect way
for scholars to feel successful even

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:24.026
if they are below and for us to push
those who are already on grade level.

00:04:24.786 --> 00:04:27.616
&gt;&gt;Mia: My favorite thing about
collaborative reading is that,

00:04:27.826 --> 00:04:31.316
since we all hear other people's
ideas, we have a better understanding.

00:04:31.756 --> 00:04:35.716
And also, we have multiple
days to figure out the meaning.

00:04:35.716 --> 00:04:39.246
&gt;&gt;Crystal: Because we do collaborative
readings, scholars get access

00:04:39.316 --> 00:04:41.936
to literacy in so many different ways.

00:04:42.576 --> 00:04:44.456
It's through their sharing
and their discussion,

00:04:44.676 --> 00:04:46.966
the process of the collaborative
reading.
