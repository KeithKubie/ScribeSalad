00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.179
For the uninitiated, “This ain’t my first
rodeo” is roughly equivalent to telling

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.640
a person that you’re more than prepared
for a given situation or that it offers little

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.660
challenge to you.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.500
It’s more often than not used derisively,
usually in situations where a more experienced

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.580
person is being given unwanted or unwarranted
advice by someone else.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.610
The phrase is similar in inclination to the
British idiom, “I didn’t come down with

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.030
the last shower” (shower in this context
referring to rain), or the expression, “I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.780
wasn’t born yesterday”.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.390
As to the origin of the expression, it would
seem it isn’t nearly as old as you might

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.390
think.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.369
The earliest known documented utterance of
it was in the 1981 film, Mommie Dearest, a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:53.790
film adaptation of a book of the same name
chronicling the life of famed actress and

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.540
dancer Joan Crawford.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.760
The book was a somewhat controversial tell-all
memoir written by Crawford’s deceased fourth

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.530
husband’s daughter, Christina Crawford,
where she portrays Joan Crawford as something

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.990
of an especially wicked step-mother.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.490
A version of the phrase is uttered by the
actress playing Crawford in a particularly

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.680
well acted scene in which she is informed
by the Pepsi board of directors that she is

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.040
going to be forcibly removed from the board.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.570
In response, Crawford verbally threatens everyone
present by stating she will publicly slam

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.870
the company and its product in an attempt
to bring it down if they remove her from the

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.870
board.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.470
When a board member tries to reason with Crawford,
she angrily yells: “Don’t fuck with me

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.470
fellas!

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.130
This ain’t my first time at the rodeo.”

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.040
While it is certainly true that the real-life
Crawford was on the board of directors for

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.690
Pepsi after the untimely death of her husband,
the then president of the company, Alfred

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.860
Steele, and it also true that the board threatened
to remove her, there is little evidence that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.240
Crawford ever uttered the line in real life.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.220
However, it hasn’t stopped the quote from
being attributed to Crawford time and time

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.220
again.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.390
In reality, as far as documented evidence
goes, the quote should either be credited

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.660
to Faye Dunaway, who played Crawford, or one
of the film’s writers, though which of them

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.990
came up with the line and how has seemingly
never been asked directly.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.890
Of course, it’s now 34 years later, so it
would be a wonder if they remembered the details

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.200
accurately, or at all, concerning how that
seemingly insignificant line was thought up

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
or who they borrowed it from, if that’s
the case.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.400
In any event, nine years after the release
of Mommie Dearest, the country singer Vern

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.340
Gosdin released a song simply titled “This
Ain’t My First Rodeo”.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.470
The song was reasonably successful and is
often credited as the source of the expression,

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.550
but in reality simply went a long way towards
popularising it.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.459
According to Vern, he first heard the phrase
after complimenting a couple of carpenters

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.790
working in his home on their work, at which
point one of them dryly responded “this

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.300
ain’t our first rodeo”.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.860
The phrase intrigued Vern so much that he
jotted it down and later turned it into the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.860
song.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.110
Other’s credited with bringing the phrase
to popular attention include NASCAR driver,

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.180
Darrell Waltrip, who is recorded as having
said it in 1983 during a post-race interview,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:03:02.850
and a Southern University coach named Gerald
Kimble who used it in 1989.
