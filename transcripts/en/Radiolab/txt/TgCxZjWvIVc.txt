Speaker 1:          00:00          This is Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. We are in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Coming to you live from the Fitzgerald Theater. Our subject today is the war of the worlds broadcast. Originally on October 30th, 1938

Speaker 2:          00:13          okay, now I'm gonna ask the house for a show of hands. The question for the house is, do you think that somebody else could imagine the broadcast using the exact same script more or less? Also with Martians also invading, also interrupting the musical things. Same deal after all the publicity from the 1938 broadcast. Could you do it twice? Show of hands, please. Oh, some of you don't think so. Look, if we could, if, if there wasn't another one of these, what would we be doing for the next one?

Speaker 1:          00:44          Well, so those of you who've raised your hands, let's say it's about 75% of you, you are correct because it has happened again and I want to tell you a story. It an amazing story, really an underreported story of a war of the worlds reenactment happened in the mountains of Quito, Ecuador, 1949 we were very lucky. We had a reporter, Tony Fields who happened to be traveling there. We asked him to do a couple of interviews for people who heard it or were there and he brought back some tape and played it for me in studio. Alright, so Tony set the scene for me. 1949 Kito. Where's Quito? Quito is the capital of Ecuador. Quito is in the middle of the mountains in the Andes mountains. [inaudible] and small town, big town. Quito. Now is a big city. At the time it was a pretty small city.

Speaker 1:          01:31          It had a quarter of a million people, you know, 300,000 tops. Um, the word that everybody who I spoke to use to describe the way the Kito was in 1949 was trying, Hilo [inaudible] said, I want to see that. And we drank like tranquil. Exactly. It is what it sounds like. Tranquil, calm, chill and radio. Quito was the most popular radio station. Everybody listened to it. So those are your basic ingredients. You've got a small town population, 250,000. You have one major radio station, which also happened to be in the same building as the one major newspaper, El Comercio and the leader of the radio station. The guy who ran it, he a devious fellow by the name of Leonardo pious. One day someone shows up with a script for Orson wells, not HD wills. Orson Welles version of war of the world gives it to Leonardo Paez. He reads, it says, brilliant, we've got to do this here in Quito.

Speaker 1:          02:32          They insert local place names, you know, so instead of the Martians landing in New Jersey, they would land and click the core Yao, which is on the outskirts of Quito. They write in parts for government officials. The minister of the interior, the mayor of Quito is their actors or real government. These would be actors doing impressions and doing impressions. That's right. Not only that, pious got his bosses at the newspaper, El Comercio to agree to run little articles in the newspaper in the two days leading up to the broadcast reporting. That strange objects had been seen in a sky's over Keith though. Wow. So he set out to screw with people basically. I mean, he was planting paranoia. It really seems like he wanted people to believe what they were hearing that night.

Speaker 3:          03:22          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:23          okay, so Saturday, February 12th, 1949 the day of the broadcast, all day long listeners here and announcement.

Speaker 4:          03:32          When does notice and [inaudible] that there's going to be a special performance by duo Benitez balance? Yeah. They need this balance here. [inaudible] at that time, we're one of the most popular musical acts in town in Rodeo. Quito.

Speaker 1:          03:46          Why don't you cue up a track number four? Hmm.

Speaker 5:          03:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          03:53          eight o'clock rolls around Beneatha's Valencia launches into their performance. They play a few songs

Speaker 5:          04:02          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:02          and suddenly there's an interruption.

Speaker 6:          04:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          04:07          some sort of strange kind of interference like sound. Okay.

Speaker 6:          04:12          Hell, what do you mean? Like

Speaker 1:          04:13          static signal, the static, the signals, you know, something's wrong with it. It's not coming in quite right. Wait, what was that? Well, it turns out that Leonardo, the pies in addition to the other tricks they had up his sleeve, he had a sound effects guy in the corner that was creating this sounds like when it garrison Keillor's guys kind of thing.

Speaker 7:          04:33          That's right. Can keep everyone [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          04:42          Eventually the music stops and Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says [inaudible] dear listeners, excuse the technical difficulties. There seems to be some sort of atmospheric conditions interfering with the radio Quito signal. But you are the thing to radio. Keep those brought to you by, you know, such and such. And now back to this balance. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          05:10          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:10          so we hear another couple songs and then there's another interruption up in soon it's laying out the payers again. And this time, this time it's a news flash. What do I do? So now we're on script. That's right. That's right. They send Paez out to report from the scene. We'll go Kojo and pies is doing the play by play. You know, what is this?

Speaker 7:          05:29          Oh my God, the cops in school, you know, from the clinicals.

Speaker 4:          05:37          And here come the heat rate.

Speaker 8:          05:43          Hi, is this fry?

Speaker 1:          05:46          You can wait, wait, wait, wait. Do we have forget reenactments? Do we have a copy of the, the real broadcast from that night? All we have are descriptions. There is no existing recording of what was broadcast that night.

Speaker 4:          05:58          And, and you'll understand why in a second.

Speaker 5:          06:04          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:04          so while I was down there in Quito, I interviewed a bunch of people about what happened that night by all accounts at work.

Speaker 5:          06:11          Oh,

Speaker 4:          06:15          outside, it was sheer Mei. Everything that happened next happened extremely quickly. People poured out into the streets, people were running, but they didn't know where to run. The spaceship supposedly was in the north of the city, but there's black cloud of gas was in the south. And a lot of them, they actually did what any good Catholic would do. They made a beeline for the church

Speaker 5:          06:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          06:41          the church because, because they were, they thought they'd be safe there or perhaps, or perhaps they just wanted to get right with God before the world ended their even reports. And I wasn't able to confirm this, but there were reports of men confessing to adultery right there in front of their wives and priests. Absolving whole crowds at once. Queue up at track track 10

Speaker 1:          07:04          [inaudible] in [inaudible] [inaudible] who is a long time journalist, worked for many years at the newspaper. He was listening with his family. They all believed it. They all ran outside, found a taxi cab to the kids and rest them ran behind the taxi cab. Eh, they were gonna [inaudible] the city [inaudible] and he tells me that he sees going the other way. This convoy military trucks

Speaker 4:          07:34          filled with soldiers. Do we real trucks, real military bans, real military vans of the real soldiers and cops behind them and they're screaming towards the north of the city. Where are they going? They're going to cut the coal yow to fight the Martians. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          07:50          So if you, if you had any doubt at this point that this was a, well maybe it's, maybe it's real, maybe it's not. And once you saw this military events, you were like, oh, bleep, I've got to get the hell out. Right. Wa does. Does everybody in Quito believe like the army? Peep, didn't someone call the general beforehand? Say Tonight we're having a broad day. The mayor or someone who sounded an awful like the mayor was on the radio saying Martians were invading. And so if you're the army guy, you're going to go check it out or you have to protect. But the mayor didn't call the general before a no, no. So then what happens at the end of the show? It assuming it ends the way they always do [inaudible] then what? Well, they a storm, the radio station,

Speaker 4:          08:36          let's go ahead. By the time of broadcast ended and it was announced, but the whole thing was a play. A huge crowds were in the streets and word that it was a hoax spread pretty quickly. All that fear turned pretty quickly to anger by nine 30 there's a few hundred outside the station. At some point this boxer shows up. They're just been a match in the Central Plaza and the boxer shows up and he's driving this truck and the truck is full of rocks. So what rocks is full of rocks? Yeah. And people start hurling the rocks at the station, at the windows and windows or shattering. They managed to break into the, to the ground floor where the printing presses, they're smashing printing presses. At some point some people in the crowd materialize and they have these flaming torches and it just goes up like a matched it. So, so, so where people hurt during this

Speaker 1:          09:29          six people died. Oh really? Yeah, most escaped. There was about 50 people in the building. Most got up to the roof, jump to adjoining buildings, but six people died according to a reporter, Tony, uh, one guy stayed behind. The last guy on the air that night was a man by the name of Luis Beltran. Maria, are you there?

Speaker 9:          09:51          Yes, I'm here.

Speaker 1:          09:53          Okay. This is Maria Beltran Testagrossa, uh, Louis Beltran's daughter and Maria, you are listening to everything that just came before this. Yeah. Tell us the story from Your Dad's perspective. Uh, from here forward. He was on the air. What was he doing?

Speaker 9:          10:10          Uh, well he was, he was on the air. He was the, I guess, hosting the music program and also doing some of the interruption with the, uh, with the bogus, uh,

Speaker 1:          10:19          [inaudible] at the point at which the fire started. What was he saying?

Speaker 9:          10:23          Well, at that point when he realized the magnitude of the situation, he went back on the air and began pleading for help pleading for assistance from the police and the fire department. But uh, as you said before, no help came because the police were going to fight the Martian.

Speaker 1:          10:39          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          10:41          And uh, eventually he was the last one left and uh, and he jumped out the window. I'd get from the either the third or fourth floor onto a, uh, second floor balcony and to break the fall, I guess instinctively you want to break the fall, he grabbed onto the railing of that balcony and he was completely engulfed in flames at that point. And the skin on his hands just remained on the balcony. It was like a barbecue grill. And, uh, from there he jumped to the ground, but before he jumped, he was pleading to the crowd to I guess catch him, but they didn't. He landed on some men, broke legs, arm, ribs, everything. And compounded by the very, very serious burns that he had all over his body.

Speaker 1:          11:31          So he landed at the feet of an angry mob. What a,

Speaker 9:          11:34          an angry mob. And He, uh, he recall that as he's losing consciousness, he just heard somebody say, just let him die in peace. Although some of the articles that I read, they try to throw him back into the building.

Speaker 1:          11:48          Oh, really? If someone,

Speaker 9:          11:50          uh, grabbed him and put him in a jeep to take him to the hospital, just the bystander and you know, he had so many scars here as children, like my brother and I would, would play with his scars. You would trace them with our finger in and ask them what happened. You know, how we got the scars? And he would tell us about the fire that, you know, the building had burned and he would tell us about that.

Speaker 1:          12:12          What would he tell you? The whole story or how much of this did you know?

Speaker 9:          12:16          Dory, he would just give us in just in broad terms, but he had been in a building that caught fire. Uh, he also told us, you know, he had been a radio announcer, but, uh, as children we didn't really ask him. Maybe had we been older and asked them, he would have told us the whole story.

Speaker 1:          12:31          Hmm. And we should say that your dad stayed behind to try and help other people get out of the building. Well, let me ask you a question though. Uh, your dad obviously is a hero, but given the fact that he was one of the voices that created the panic, do you feel some sort of ambivalence about, did he feel some sort of ambivalence about,

Speaker 9:          12:50          I don't know, in retrospect whether he did or not. I'm sure there must've been some ambivalence. But from what I understand, the story was kept, it was very top secret so that even the employees did not know what was going to be broadcast during that music program. Really. I don't know at what point he was informed of the details. So I don't know really how we felt about it. I wish I had had an opportunity to ask him.

Speaker 1:          13:14          Hmm. Well listen, Maria, thank you so much for your time and joining us here and yeah, thanks. Perfect.

Speaker 10:         13:26          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          13:26          I just want to know what happened to the guy who planned the hoax. Uh, well, uh, he uh, he got out through the roof like a lot of others. He hopped to the next building, hid out for a few days, and then fled the country to Venezuelan. Never to return, never to return, never to return. But I should say that among the six people who died that night was his girlfriend and a nephew of his. Okay. So the 1949 Quito broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble. The 1938 New York broadcasts caused a whole lot of trouble. Now everybody here before who raised their hand and thought that this could happen again. You are right again, Lau, Buffalo, 1968

Speaker 11:         14:13          on a weird night, nobody came in. Nobody with Jackson off shore on the radio hunting, going to get it all together between now and about midnight a little bit thereafter, whatever. It's the height of the Vietnam war, Wk BW broadcast. It's a fascinating version of the war of the worlds updated for the time. It sounds kind of like your [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          14:31          basic DJ set until you hear this.

Speaker 11:         14:33          What is your toe down? And you just handed me something here that I'm much supposed to read. Thank you. Thank you Joe. Uh, let's see. The NASA national, the national spatial and there are not exert administration. Those people have alerted all their space watch and uh, facilities to be on the alert for unusual communication difficulties tonight, I suppose before the, a federal referred to the explosions on the planet Mars and study was not known if they would have the same effect on earth communications as similar explosions on the surface of the sun have, I guess you're talking about sun spots and things like that. So, uh, I don't know what it's shadowed. It means that it's going to be hard to hear communications from national. I don't, can you hear me? Daughters' South Carolina. As long as you can hear kv, whatever's you'd make about communication, rock and roll. [inaudible] any objection off? Can you take what your hand Halloween night getting it all together. Where it will you KBW

Speaker 2:          15:19          w KBW broadcast followed the same structure as the original broadcast. We've heard tonight long stretches of music than the news bulletins than the send me realistic field reports. Here's one of them.

Speaker 5:          15:30          What do you got? You got walking injuries or are a real bad,

Speaker 2:          15:33          you got the same vivid descriptions of Martian.

Speaker 5:          15:36          Hi by God we all got it, Don. I got it. They all got it.

Speaker 2:          15:40          And according to the station manager Jeff K, he kept the same outcome. People bought it.

Speaker 11:         15:45          Hello? Hello. Police and telephone company reported to Wk VW that they received more than 4,000 phone calls. The Canadian military authorities dispatched military units to the peace bridge, the Rainbow Bridge and the Queenstown Bridge to repel invaders. The story was carried the next day by 47 newspapers in the country wide. And on the night of the show and during the show, you're not impressed. Bureaus up and down the east coast of America where a besieged by phone calls asking about the Martian invasion in buffalo. Incredible. You're absolutely right. It is incredible.

Speaker 5:          16:21          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          16:21          thanks to the folks at Wk BW buffalo for that. What is this music, by the way? This is the disco version of war of the worlds 1978 there's a discovered, still sells a lot of copies. You'd be surprised. Here's the obvious question to ask.

Speaker 11:         16:44          What does this keep working? Oh, well that's a difficult question. I came across a psychology professor. I'm Richard Gehrig. I am a professor of psychology in the cognitive experimental program at Stony Brook University. He has this notion Richard Gehrig does and it route people are suckers for stories. We just cannot help ourselves. When a story starts, you just kind of go, whoa. Think the norm is to fall into the story and that it's unusual to sort of keep yourself from falling it by. Favorite example is a, there's a scene in gold finger. God.

Speaker 1:          17:16          Yeah, the all time best James Bond movie. I think we're bond is tied down, spread eagle on a piece of metal and there's this laser coming toward him, which really looks like it's gonna cut him into. And even as I'm saying that right now, I'm starting to feel a little bit of anxiety because as a picture you get in my head and picture that laser coming toward him and you know, spoiler alert, he doesn't actually get split into by the laser yet. Sorry, but here's the thing. Go and watch the movie now and see if you can get through that scene without experience. Suspense. And it really seems to say something very powerful and strong about how immerse we can become

Speaker 2:          17:50          in the narrative world.

Speaker 10:         17:58          [inaudible] the thing is,

Speaker 2:          18:04          we do go in, Leo all fall into these stories. He says, it's just the way we are built for hundreds of thousands of years. Our memories, our friendships, our sense of family, our kinship. We build our identities from stories, stories that we tell and stories that we hear.

Speaker 1:          18:24          Well, let's take a break coming up. Terror in the toilets, python in the Potty, and more scary stories on this edition of Radiolab. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich. We will continue in a moment.
