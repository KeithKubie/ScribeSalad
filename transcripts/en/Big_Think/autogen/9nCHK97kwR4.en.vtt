gives scientists a way to go in and edit

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
gives scientists a way to go in and edit
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300
gives scientists a way to go in and edit
the letters of DNA just like we might

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310

even whole paragraphs or chapters we can
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.640
even whole paragraphs or chapters we can
now do that using the CRISPR technology

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650
now do that using the CRISPR technology
 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.760
now do that using the CRISPR technology
in the DNA itself so when we think about

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770
in the DNA itself so when we think about
 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.690
in the DNA itself so when we think about
a technology that allows precise changes

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700
a technology that allows precise changes
 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.929
a technology that allows precise changes

to DNA to be made you know for
 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.590
to DNA to be made you know for
scientists this is sort of a you know a

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600
scientists this is sort of a you know a
 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.620
scientists this is sort of a you know a
really a gift that allows research to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
really a gift that allows research to
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.780
really a gift that allows research to
proceed very quickly in terms of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790
proceed very quickly in terms of
 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.569
proceed very quickly in terms of
understanding the genetics of cells and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
understanding the genetics of cells and
 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.910
understanding the genetics of cells and
organisms but also provides a very

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920
organisms but also provides a very
 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.130
organisms but also provides a very
practical way to solve problems and

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140
practical way to solve problems and
 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.130
practical way to solve problems and
there's a there's a many that we could

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140
there's a there's a many that we could
 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.170
there's a there's a many that we could
discuss but I'll mention a couple that I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180
discuss but I'll mention a couple that I
 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.290
discuss but I'll mention a couple that I
think are particularly exciting so in in

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300
think are particularly exciting so in in
 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.860
think are particularly exciting so in in
clinical medicine the opportunity to may

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
clinical medicine the opportunity to may
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.199
clinical medicine the opportunity to may
changes to blood cells that would cure

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209
changes to blood cells that would cure
 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:18.199
changes to blood cells that would cure
diseases like sickle cell anemia disease

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209
diseases like sickle cell anemia disease
 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.420
diseases like sickle cell anemia disease
where you know we've understood the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
where you know we've understood the
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.089
where you know we've understood the
genetic cause for a long time but until

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099
genetic cause for a long time but until
 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.119
genetic cause for a long time but until
now there hasn't been a way to actually

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129
now there hasn't been a way to actually
 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.100
now there hasn't been a way to actually
think about treating patients and now

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
think about treating patients and now
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.559
think about treating patients and now
with this technology it's possible in

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569
with this technology it's possible in
 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.949
with this technology it's possible in
principle to remove stem cells that give

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959
principle to remove stem cells that give
 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.619
principle to remove stem cells that give
rise to blood cells in a person's body

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629
rise to blood cells in a person's body
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.229
rise to blood cells in a person's body
make edits to those cells that would

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239
make edits to those cells that would
 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.259
make edits to those cells that would
correct the mutation causing sickle cell

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269
correct the mutation causing sickle cell
 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.530
correct the mutation causing sickle cell
disease and then replace those cells to

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
disease and then replace those cells to
 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.960
disease and then replace those cells to
essentially give a patient a new a new

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970
essentially give a patient a new a new
 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.210
essentially give a patient a new a new
set of cells that don't have the defect

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
set of cells that don't have the defect
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.770
set of cells that don't have the defect
so I think that's very exciting and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
so I think that's very exciting and
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.800
so I think that's very exciting and
there are multiple research groups right

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810
there are multiple research groups right
 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.170
there are multiple research groups right
now working on doing just that so I

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180
now working on doing just that so I
 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.720
now working on doing just that so I
think that's a future you know probably

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730
think that's a future you know probably
 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.190
think that's a future you know probably
sometime in the next two to five years

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200
sometime in the next two to five years
 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.430
sometime in the next two to five years
we will see clinical trials in that area

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
we will see clinical trials in that area
 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.699
we will see clinical trials in that area
and we hope real progress towards curing

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709
and we hope real progress towards curing
 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.160
and we hope real progress towards curing
that disease but there's a you know

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170
that disease but there's a you know
 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.869
that disease but there's a you know
another example that I think is also

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879
another example that I think is also
 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:13.789
another example that I think is also
very potentially very impactful

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799
very potentially very impactful
 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.309
very potentially very impactful
clinically but it has a very different

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319
clinically but it has a very different
 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.640
clinically but it has a very different
kind of strategy is the idea of making

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
kind of strategy is the idea of making
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.539
kind of strategy is the idea of making
edits to pigs to create animals that are

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549
edits to pigs to create animals that are
 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.330
edits to pigs to create animals that are
going to be better organ donors for

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
going to be better organ donors for
 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.520
going to be better organ donors for
humans and so pigs are already of

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530
humans and so pigs are already of
 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.680
humans and so pigs are already of
interest for for organ donation but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690
interest for for organ donation but
 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.949
interest for for organ donation but
imagine that we could make edits to the

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959
imagine that we could make edits to the
 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.619
imagine that we could make edits to the
DNA of pigs to make their organs more

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629
DNA of pigs to make their organs more
 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:38.860
DNA of pigs to make their organs more
human-like and also to remove any

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870
human-like and also to remove any
 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.449
human-like and also to remove any
viruses from pig cells that might

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459
viruses from pig cells that might
 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.210
viruses from pig cells that might
otherwise infect a patient and those are

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220
otherwise infect a patient and those are
 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.000
otherwise infect a patient and those are
both things that are actively underway

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010
both things that are actively underway
 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.330
both things that are actively underway
using the CRISPR technology and then a

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340
using the CRISPR technology and then a
 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.189
using the CRISPR technology and then a
third area that I think is interesting

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199
third area that I think is interesting
 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.379
third area that I think is interesting
to think about from the perspective of

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389
to think about from the perspective of
 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.349
to think about from the perspective of
global impact in disease is thinking

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359
global impact in disease is thinking
 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:01.309
global impact in disease is thinking
about using gene editing not to not to

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319
about using gene editing not to not to
 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.619
about using gene editing not to not to
change the DNA and people per se but

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:03.629
change the DNA and people per se but
 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.979
change the DNA and people per se but
actually to affect the kinds of insects

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989
actually to affect the kinds of insects
 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.979
actually to affect the kinds of insects
that transmit disease to people and the

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989
that transmit disease to people and the
 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.349
that transmit disease to people and the
idea here is that one could use a gene

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359
idea here is that one could use a gene
 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.659
idea here is that one could use a gene
editor to create mosquitoes that would

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:14.669
editor to create mosquitoes that would
 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:17.689
editor to create mosquitoes that would
be unable to transmit viruses like

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699
be unable to transmit viruses like
 

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:21.740
be unable to transmit viruses like
dengue virus or Zika virus by using a

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750
dengue virus or Zika virus by using a
 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.350
dengue virus or Zika virus by using a
technique called gene drive that allows

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360
technique called gene drive that allows
 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.070
technique called gene drive that allows
traits to be

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080
traits to be
 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.779
traits to be
read very quickly through a population

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:27.789
read very quickly through a population
 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:30.689
read very quickly through a population
using an efficient way of gene editing

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:30.699
using an efficient way of gene editing
 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.600
using an efficient way of gene editing
such as the the CRISPR tool and I think

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610
such as the the CRISPR tool and I think
 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.670
such as the the CRISPR tool and I think
that's an opportunity that you know

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680
that's an opportunity that you know
 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.149
that's an opportunity that you know
could have very big impact in in terms

00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:39.159
could have very big impact in in terms
 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:41.339
could have very big impact in in terms
of global health but also requires

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349
of global health but also requires
 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.379
of global health but also requires
obviously some you know very thorough

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389
obviously some you know very thorough
 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.589
obviously some you know very thorough
vetting and discussion about potential

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599
vetting and discussion about potential
 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:49.379
vetting and discussion about potential
environmental impact I think one of the

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389
environmental impact I think one of the
 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.929
environmental impact I think one of the
the aspects of this technology that's

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939
the aspects of this technology that's
 

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.600
the aspects of this technology that's
been very interesting to me personally

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610
been very interesting to me personally
 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.179
been very interesting to me personally
is my own kind of personal growth

00:04:57.179 --> 00:04:57.189
is my own kind of personal growth
 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:59.550
is my own kind of personal growth
through the last few years I think that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560
through the last few years I think that
 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.100
through the last few years I think that
you know when I started this research

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110
you know when I started this research
 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.740
you know when I started this research
project which actually began now almost

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750
project which actually began now almost
 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:07.230
project which actually began now almost
10 years ago in the lab we were

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240
10 years ago in the lab we were
 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.020
10 years ago in the lab we were
certainly not thinking about technology

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030
certainly not thinking about technology
 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.350
certainly not thinking about technology
that would allow alteration of human

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360
that would allow alteration of human
 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.360
that would allow alteration of human
evolution or anything of that nature

and over the last few years when as this

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180
and over the last few years when as this

gone from you know thinking about it

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680
gone from you know thinking about it
 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.490
gone from you know thinking about it
initially just with you know sort of

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500
initially just with you know sort of
 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.649
initially just with you know sort of
almost you know wide-eyed excitement

00:05:34.649 --> 00:05:34.659
almost you know wide-eyed excitement
 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:36.390
almost you know wide-eyed excitement
thinking about all the opportunities

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400
thinking about all the opportunities
 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.659
thinking about all the opportunities
that this offers to realizing that you

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669
that this offers to realizing that you
 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.670
that this offers to realizing that you
know there was real risk and that that

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:41.680
know there was real risk and that that
 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.499
know there was real risk and that that
we really needed we meaning the

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509
we really needed we meaning the
 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.269
we really needed we meaning the
scientific community and really frankly

00:05:45.269 --> 00:05:45.279
scientific community and really frankly
 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.219
scientific community and really frankly
the the human community needed to be

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229
the the human community needed to be
 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.829
the the human community needed to be
aware of this and discussing it and one

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839
aware of this and discussing it and one
 

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.110
aware of this and discussing it and one
of the things that that sort of brought

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120
of the things that that sort of brought
 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.899
of the things that that sort of brought
that to the forefront of my mind was a

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:54.909
that to the forefront of my mind was a
 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.829
that to the forefront of my mind was a
dream that I had fairly early on in

00:05:57.829 --> 00:05:57.839
dream that I had fairly early on in
 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.439
dream that I had fairly early on in
which I was you know I walked into a

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449
which I was you know I walked into a
 

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.939
which I was you know I walked into a
room and a colleague of mine said to me

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949
room and a colleague of mine said to me
 

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:08.070
room and a colleague of mine said to me
Jennifer I'd like you to explain the

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080
Jennifer I'd like you to explain the
 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.309
Jennifer I'd like you to explain the
CRISPR technology to a friend and he

00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319
CRISPR technology to a friend and he
 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:14.059
CRISPR technology to a friend and he
brought me into a room and there a

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.069
brought me into a room and there a
 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.219
brought me into a room and there a
person was sitting with their back to me

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:17.229
person was sitting with their back to me
 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:20.189
person was sitting with their back to me
and as they turned around I realized was

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199
and as they turned around I realized was
 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.529
and as they turned around I realized was
sort of a horror horror that it was it

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539
sort of a horror horror that it was it
 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.059
sort of a horror horror that it was it
was Hitler and it was actually Hitler

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:24.069
was Hitler and it was actually Hitler
 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:26.700
was Hitler and it was actually Hitler
with a sort of a pig nose and it almost

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710
with a sort of a pig nose and it almost
 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.610
with a sort of a pig nose and it almost
looked like a chimeric pig human sort of

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620
looked like a chimeric pig human sort of
 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.329
looked like a chimeric pig human sort of
sort of creature and it was it was you

00:06:33.329 --> 00:06:33.339
sort of creature and it was it was you
 

00:06:33.339 --> 00:06:35.820
sort of creature and it was it was you
know it sounds funny and a way to relate

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830
know it sounds funny and a way to relate
 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:37.949
know it sounds funny and a way to relate
that image but in the dream it was a

00:06:37.949 --> 00:06:37.959
that image but in the dream it was a
 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:39.510
that image but in the dream it was a
terrifying thing and I

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:39.520
terrifying thing and I
 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.379
terrifying thing and I
really felt real just you know

00:06:42.379 --> 00:06:42.389
really felt real just you know
 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:45.510
really felt real just you know
stone-cold fear in the dream and sort of

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520
stone-cold fear in the dream and sort of
 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.550
stone-cold fear in the dream and sort of
woke up from that dream with a start and

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560
woke up from that dream with a start and
 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.740
woke up from that dream with a start and
realized you know kind of had this

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750
realized you know kind of had this
 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:51.420
realized you know kind of had this
initial feeling of what what have I done

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430
initial feeling of what what have I done
 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:54.839
initial feeling of what what have I done
you know and and that was really one of

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:54.849
you know and and that was really one of
 

00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:57.990
you know and and that was really one of
the things that that that motivated me

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000
the things that that that motivated me
 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.960
the things that that that motivated me
to you know to get out of the lab and

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970
to you know to get out of the lab and
 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.029
to you know to get out of the lab and
start talking to people more broadly

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:03.039
start talking to people more broadly
 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:05.100
start talking to people more broadly
about the technology about capabilities

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110
about the technology about capabilities
 

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.260
about the technology about capabilities
about the great things about it but also

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270
about the great things about it but also
 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.409
about the great things about it but also
about things that really required really

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419
about things that really required really
 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:13.559
about things that really required really
deep thought and careful consideration

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569
deep thought and careful consideration
 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:16.410
