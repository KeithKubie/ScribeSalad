00:00:00.897 --> 00:00:01.730
- [Steve] You tell them how we met.

00:00:02.563 --> 00:00:03.560
'Cause you're really good at telling them.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:04.490
- [Candace] We met at a singles' group.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.073
We were looking for each other.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:14.222
- The first bunny of the whole collection

00:00:14.222 --> 00:00:16.091
is a Valentine's bunny about this big.

00:00:16.091 --> 00:00:18.992
It's really cute. It says,
"Guess how much I love you?"

00:00:18.992 --> 00:00:21.803
- [Steve] I went to a florist
shop to get her a gift

00:00:21.803 --> 00:00:24.319
and everything was bears,
and bears, and bears,

00:00:24.319 --> 00:00:27.600
and a couple of turtles
and a couple ducks.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.880
I'm a contrarian I like to
do things that are different.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.394
- I was calling him my "honey
bunny," and he liked that.

00:00:32.394 --> 00:00:35.492
- I found a bunny in a giant balloon.

00:00:35.492 --> 00:00:39.203
And then she gave me one,
and so we started ...

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:41.032
- [Candace] On our first Easter.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:41.865
- [Steve] First Easter.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:43.742
- [Candace] Then it became every holiday,

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:44.971
we'd give each other bunny gifts.

00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:46.219
- [Steve] I couldn't
wait, so I would get her

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.790
a bunch of them and she'd
say, "Wait 'til the holiday,"

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.673
and I'd say no.

00:00:50.673 --> 00:00:52.832
- [Candace] "Open, open,
open it, it's so good!"

00:00:52.832 --> 00:00:54.748
And I'm like, no.

00:00:54.748 --> 00:00:57.998
- [Steve] And so we started.
Eventually it became every day.

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.012
- [Candace] All our wedding gifts,

00:01:00.012 --> 00:01:01.950
most of the wedding gifts were bunnies.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.287
By our wedding, people knew
we were collecting bunnies

00:01:05.287 --> 00:01:07.378
and so it became a big thing. I made

00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:09.648
the wedding cake. It was a carrot cake.

00:01:09.648 --> 00:01:11.699
There were stairs going up to the cake.

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:14.058
There was a bride and groom,
and it was a bunny, and ...

00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:15.600
Bunnies were a part of our life

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.568
just from the beginning, and
everyone kinda knew that.

00:01:17.568 --> 00:01:19.899
They'd write cards "to the honey bunnies"

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:21.028
and that kind of stuff.

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:24.195
So we were collecting about four years

00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:26.779
and then we decided to
open up to the public,

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:29.191
because we would joke that
we lived in a bunny museum

00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:30.832
and our family and friends
would joke and say,

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:33.636
"It's too bad other people can't see these

00:01:33.636 --> 00:01:34.919
fantastic things you have."

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:36.546
So we opened up to the public,

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:39.046
and that was 20 years ago.

00:01:59.044 --> 00:02:01.359
- [Candace] We have over a hundred

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.348
categories within the museum.

00:02:03.348 --> 00:02:05.060
And it's interesting, you know the saying,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.319
"Two's company, three's a crowd." For us,

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.939
two's company, three
or more is a category.

00:02:09.939 --> 00:02:11.339
(laughs)

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.873
Some people will hop over
and they'll look at a shelf

00:02:13.873 --> 00:02:15.472
and they'll go, "I don't
get the category here."

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:17.889
I'm like, "There's no category!"

00:02:19.425 --> 00:02:22.315
- [Steve] It's a story of
love between Candace and I

00:02:22.315 --> 00:02:24.585
and what we want to bring forth is

00:02:24.585 --> 00:02:29.131
a way of showing a couple's
love toward each other

00:02:29.131 --> 00:02:34.035
and how it perpetuated the
collection further and further.

00:02:34.035 --> 00:02:36.888
- [Candace] It's no
different than anything

00:02:36.888 --> 00:02:38.735
else when it comes to love.

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.606
The fact is, everyone should
have the same religion,

00:02:41.606 --> 00:02:44.077
and religion means how you live your life.

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:46.426
It does not mean being a certain religion:

00:02:46.426 --> 00:02:49.676
It's what you believe in,
whether you're a vegetarian,

00:02:49.676 --> 00:02:51.648
or whether you're a dog owner

00:02:51.648 --> 00:02:54.731
and you wanna marry another dog owner.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:02:59.272
You have to have
similarities to begin with.

00:02:59.272 --> 00:03:01.550
So you have the basis of similarity

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.413
and then you do something together.

00:03:03.413 --> 00:03:05.312
Some people might like antiquing,

00:03:05.312 --> 00:03:07.470
or traveling, or they play golf,

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.095
so their goal is to go and play

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:12.473
all the golf courses around the world.

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:15.473
It's something that you do together.
