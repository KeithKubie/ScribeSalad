00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.290
So, with the way formulas work, and

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.400
how they can grab fields off related objects.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:05.845
&gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

00:00:05.845 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; Unfortunately, you can't grab the user's email.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:08.830
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.780
&gt;&gt; But, that's only from this pick list. Instead of using

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.320
the, run this rule for criteria met, change that pick list to,

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.620
if the formula evaluates to true. And this'll be another place

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.120
that we can create a formula, in order to add some logic.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.630
&gt;&gt; I've seen this before.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:21.720
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.860
&gt;&gt; Cool. So if the following formula evaluates to true,

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.750
should I go to user?

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.360
&gt;&gt; So we want to still go in maitenence ticket.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:29.730
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.640
&gt;&gt; But we can treverse through that technician field.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.490
&gt;&gt; Oh cool.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.640
&gt;&gt; In order to grab fields off of the technician.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.640
&gt;&gt; Technician, nice. Okay. So this is the

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.700
field that represents the email address of the technician.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.330
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.510
&gt;&gt; And how do I check to see if it exists or not?

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.740
&gt;&gt; So, we can first add an if statement like we had before.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.820
&gt;&gt; So paste that technician email.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.980
&gt;&gt; I'm going to do sum logical test with technician email.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.170
&gt;&gt; This is another one of those. There's a

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.000
fancy little method out there for checking if it's null.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.350
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.070
&gt;&gt; So, you can actually see it right there on the right, is null.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.470
&gt;&gt; Is null.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.620
&gt;&gt; But I want technician email in this place where it says expression.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.890
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.520
&gt;&gt; So I'm going to cut and paste. Value if true, value if false.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.180
&gt;&gt; So, we can just those parameters manually. We can

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.220
put, if the value is true, set it to true,

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.460
if it's false, set it to false. And so, if

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.950
this if statement evaluates to true, then the workflow will run.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.340
&gt;&gt; and then the formula, okay, the formula value is true.
