So authentication helps
us answer the question,

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.810
who the request is coming from.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:09.110
But then we have to check if
the source of the request is

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.110
actually authorized to access
the resource they're asking for.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.490
Well, this is the access control,
or authorization problem.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.670
The focus of this lesson is going
to be on access control and

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.040
how it can be implemented
in a computer system.
