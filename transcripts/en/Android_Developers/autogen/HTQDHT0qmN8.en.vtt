00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060
would actually be flush to the top until
 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.820
would actually be flush to the top until
you pull it down and then it reveals an

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830
you pull it down and then it reveals an
 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.710
you pull it down and then it reveals an
extra options interpreter refraction so

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720
extra options interpreter refraction so
 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.660
extra options interpreter refraction so
in my opinion is this isn't working

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670
in my opinion is this isn't working
 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.600
in my opinion is this isn't working
terribly well because pull-to-refresh I

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610
terribly well because pull-to-refresh I
 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.250
terribly well because pull-to-refresh I
guess has some convenience it's just one

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260
guess has some convenience it's just one
 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.860
guess has some convenience it's just one
gesture whereas this is like a gesture

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870
gesture whereas this is like a gesture
 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.080

than its app so you may as well just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090
than its app so you may as well just

have the refresh button for me I prefer

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040
have the refresh button for me I prefer
 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.160
have the refresh button for me I prefer
like you say Adam the refresh button in

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170
like you say Adam the refresh button in
 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.780
like you say Adam the refresh button in
the action bar which turns into an inter

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790
the action bar which turns into an inter
 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.590

similar progress

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
similar progress
 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.380
similar progress
mostly because in Android and lists

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390
mostly because in Android and lists
 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.870
mostly because in Android and lists
aren't springy like I can see this is a

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880
aren't springy like I can see this is a
 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.170
aren't springy like I can see this is a
pattern from from Tweety on iOS and it

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180
pattern from from Tweety on iOS and it
 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.310
pattern from from Tweety on iOS and it
works pretty well on that platform

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320
works pretty well on that platform
 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.380
works pretty well on that platform
because each list has this kind of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390
because each list has this kind of
 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.250
because each list has this kind of
springy characteristic to it so it you

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260
springy characteristic to it so it you
 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.810
springy characteristic to it so it you
know it works really well to overextend

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820
know it works really well to overextend
 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.490
know it works really well to overextend
it to kind of do something but it's

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500
it to kind of do something but it's
 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.110
it to kind of do something but it's
Android you don't have the expectation

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120
Android you don't have the expectation
 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.520
Android you don't have the expectation
is to have some kind of force field blow

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530
is to have some kind of force field blow
 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.870
is to have some kind of force field blow
or you know it's some kind of indication

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880
or you know it's some kind of indication
 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.000
or you know it's some kind of indication
you've reached the end of the list so

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010
you've reached the end of the list so
 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.590
you've reached the end of the list so
there to prevent reveal an extra option

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600
there to prevent reveal an extra option
 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.570
there to prevent reveal an extra option
doesn't fit with the mental model for me

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580
doesn't fit with the mental model for me
 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.969
doesn't fit with the mental model for me
yeah I definitely agree I think that you

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979
yeah I definitely agree I think that you
 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.980
yeah I definitely agree I think that you
know if you use something like taps or I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990
know if you use something like taps or I
 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.379

guess pull-to-refresh really our

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:37.389
guess pull-to-refresh really our
 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:39.120

recommendation has been if you use it

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130
recommendation has been if you use it
 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.130
recommendation has been if you use it
then you know use it in addition to

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140
then you know use it in addition to
 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.530
then you know use it in addition to
something like a refresh button in the

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:43.540
something like a refresh button in the
 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.930
something like a refresh button in the
action bar or even in the overflow if

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940
action bar or even in the overflow if
 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.420
action bar or even in the overflow if
refresh is automatic or if it's

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430
refresh is automatic or if it's
 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:49.620
refresh is automatic or if it's
something that users aren't really going

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630
something that users aren't really going
 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.020
something that users aren't really going
to use all the time then putting it into

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030
to use all the time then putting it into
 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.270
to use all the time then putting it into
the overflow is totally acceptable and I

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280
the overflow is totally acceptable and I
 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.320
the overflow is totally acceptable and I
think in this case there's plenty of

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330
think in this case there's plenty of
 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.570
think in this case there's plenty of
room to show an actual action item there

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580
room to show an actual action item there
 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.490
room to show an actual action item there
you know sometimes it may not be

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500
you know sometimes it may not be
 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.719
you know sometimes it may not be
possibly have to put in the overflow

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:00.729
possibly have to put in the overflow
 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.570
possibly have to put in the overflow
menu so maybe you know pull-to-refresh

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
menu so maybe you know pull-to-refresh
 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.610
menu so maybe you know pull-to-refresh
might be more obvious to users then I

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620
might be more obvious to users then I
 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.440
might be more obvious to users then I
guess but you know in this case I

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:07.450
guess but you know in this case I
 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.880
guess but you know in this case I
personally would think it'd be a good

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890
personally would think it'd be a good
 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.270
personally would think it'd be a good

and a couple times down on me so I've

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930
and a couple times down on me so I've
 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:06.970
and a couple times down on me so I've
been pretty happy of using the

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980
been pretty happy of using the
 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.490
been pretty happy of using the
application but what I really feel like

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500
application but what I really feel like
 

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.970
application but what I really feel like
it's lacking is some tablet features so

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:12.980
it's lacking is some tablet features so
 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.770
it's lacking is some tablet features so
if we look at what the functionality of

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:14.780
if we look at what the functionality of
 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.270
if we look at what the functionality of
the application offers on the website

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280
the application offers on the website
 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.800
the application offers on the website
there's actually some really really

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810
there's actually some really really
 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.450
there's actually some really really
useful functionality which I feel would

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460
useful functionality which I feel would
 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:22.630
useful functionality which I feel would
be perfect to pull into the the tablet

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:22.640
be perfect to pull into the the tablet
 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.470
be perfect to pull into the the tablet
application so here for example this is

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:26.480
application so here for example this is
 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.060
application so here for example this is
a kind of the base workout screen in

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070
a kind of the base workout screen in

which you can use to track your workouts
 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.170
which you can use to track your workouts
and I find this really motivating

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:32.180
and I find this really motivating
 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:33.730
and I find this really motivating
because you get this like a month view

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740
because you get this like a month view
 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.520
because you get this like a month view
which shows tiny little avatars of the

kind of this is one of the things that
 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:42.070
kind of this is one of the things that
keeps me coming back and keeps me using

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080
keeps me coming back and keeps me using
 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.080
keeps me coming back and keeps me using
the application like if I miss a couple

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090
the application like if I miss a couple
 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:45.550
the application like if I miss a couple
of days and there's no way you can come

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:15.130
use the different different affordance
basically the the overflow affordance to

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:15.140
basically the the overflow affordance to
 

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.930

is very similar to what Google now does
 

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.500
is very similar to what Google now does
so in Google now you have a bunch of

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:41.510
so in Google now you have a bunch of
 

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.400
so in Google now you have a bunch of
cards to look at settings for a card or

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:45.410
cards to look at settings for a card or
 

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:47.500
cards to look at settings for a card or
to take action on cards along with

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:47.510
to take action on cards along with
 

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.880
to take action on cards along with
action buttons at the bottom you can

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:48.890
action buttons at the bottom you can
 

00:12:48.890 --> 00:12:52.090
action buttons at the bottom you can
actually see this overflow next to each

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:52.100
actually see this overflow next to each
 

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:56.140
actually see this overflow next to each
card and then lastly we've we've done

00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:56.150
card and then lastly we've we've done
 

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.020
card and then lastly we've we've done
this kind of unique presentation of

nearby routes so we've looked at you
 

00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:03.430
nearby routes so we've looked at you
know what you know let's say this app

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.440
know what you know let's say this app
 

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.380

00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:58.670
need for pointy lockscreen yeah there's
 

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.940
need for pointy lockscreen yeah there's
actually a combination of condensed here

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:00.950
actually a combination of condensed here
 

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:05.440
actually a combination of condensed here
so there's condensed and light I believe

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.450
so there's condensed and light I believe
 

00:14:05.450 --> 00:14:07.000
so there's condensed and light I believe
there's bold light and condensed

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.010
there's bold light and condensed
 

00:14:07.010 --> 00:14:09.040
there's bold light and condensed

marks so yeah my general feeling is I

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:13.970
marks so yeah my general feeling is I
 

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.490

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:17.420
major sections you've broken up into two
 

00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:20.199
major sections you've broken up into two

tablet with you know space enough to
 

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:23.560
tablet with you know space enough to
display this thing so you kind of get

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.570
display this thing so you kind of get
 

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:25.300
display this thing so you kind of get
this instant view of what's going on you

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:25.310
this instant view of what's going on you
 

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.640
this instant view of what's going on you
get these free major topics that I'm

00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:27.650
get these free major topics that I'm
 

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.640
get these free major topics that I'm
really interested in looking at from

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:30.650
really interested in looking at from
 

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:32.800
really interested in looking at from
from the first thing I mean I'd love to

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:32.810
from the first thing I mean I'd love to
 

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:34.210
from the first thing I mean I'd love to
be able to tap through some of these

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:34.220
be able to tap through some of these
 

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.890
be able to tap through some of these
statistics on the left and I can imagine

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:35.900
statistics on the left and I can imagine
 

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:37.240
statistics on the left and I can imagine
seeing some of those graphs which a

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:37.250
seeing some of those graphs which a
 

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.800
seeing some of those graphs which a
failure on the website being available

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:38.810
failure on the website being available
 

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.210
failure on the website being available
on the device as well that'd be

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:40.220
on the device as well that'd be
 

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:42.250
on the device as well that'd be
wonderful but then yeah I think they've

00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:42.260
wonderful but then yeah I think they've
 

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.870
wonderful but then yeah I think they've
kind of you've done a nice job of like

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:43.880
kind of you've done a nice job of like
 

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.820
kind of you've done a nice job of like
bubbling up the things I really care

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:45.830
bubbling up the things I really care
 

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.350
bubbling up the things I really care
about and it's important to note that

00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360
about and it's important to note that
 

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.300
about and it's important to note that
like these this dashboard is very

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:49.310
like these this dashboard is very
 

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.040
like these this dashboard is very
interactive its content forward and the

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:51.050
interactive its content forward and the
 

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.990
interactive its content forward and the
content is manipulable right so if you

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:53.000
content is manipulable right so if you
 

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.030
content is manipulable right so if you
want to touch into snowboarding to see

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040
want to touch into snowboarding to see
 

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:57.760
want to touch into snowboarding to see
you know all the different stats for

00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:57.770
you know all the different stats for
 

00:14:57.770 --> 00:15:00.370
you know all the different stats for
your snowboarding for this month you can

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:00.380
your snowboarding for this month you can
 

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:01.720
your snowboarding for this month you can
do that you should be able to touch that

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:01.730
do that you should be able to touch that
 

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:03.160
do that you should be able to touch that
i'm the other thing i'll mention is that

00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:03.170
i'm the other thing i'll mention is that
 

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.690
i'm the other thing i'll mention is that
you know this app had more than just

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:04.700
you know this app had more than just
 

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.880
you know this app had more than just
these three sections so what i've done

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:06.890
these three sections so what i've done
 

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:10.600
these three sections so what i've done
here is i've offered a an action bar

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:10.610
here is i've offered a an action bar
 

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.150
here is i've offered a an action bar
spinner to to show you other parts of

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:13.160
spinner to to show you other parts of
 

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.250
spinner to to show you other parts of
the app so if you want to jump into like

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:15.260
the app so if you want to jump into like
 

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.590
the app so if you want to jump into like
other sections for example not

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:17.600
other sections for example not
 

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.730
other sections for example not
necessarily not the settings because

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:18.740
necessarily not the settings because
 

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:19.960
necessarily not the settings because
that should be in the action overflow

00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:19.970
that should be in the action overflow
 

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.920
that should be in the action overflow
but maybe like i don't know if you

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:23.930
but maybe like i don't know if you
 

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:25.720
but maybe like i don't know if you
actually want to start capturing you

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:25.730
actually want to start capturing you
 

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:27.610
actually want to start capturing you
know data on a tablet maybe that's

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:27.620
know data on a tablet maybe that's
 

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:28.540
know data on a tablet maybe that's
that's something that you should be able

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.550
that's something that you should be able
 

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.699
that's something that you should be able
to do from us but yeah i think it's very

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:30.709
to do from us but yeah i think it's very
 

00:15:30.709 --> 00:15:32.620
to do from us but yeah i think it's very
important to stress that then this is

00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:32.630
important to stress that then this is
 

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.630
important to stress that then this is
the same application as we just saw on

00:15:34.630 --> 00:15:34.640
the same application as we just saw on
 

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:35.980
the same application as we just saw on
the phone right i think it's completely

00:15:35.980 --> 00:15:35.990
the phone right i think it's completely
 

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.320
the phone right i think it's completely
okay to have a completely different you

00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:38.330
okay to have a completely different you
 

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:39.640
okay to have a completely different you
know dashboard completely different home

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:39.650
know dashboard completely different home
 

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.350
know dashboard completely different home
screen when you're running an entire

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360
screen when you're running an entire
 

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.820
screen when you're running an entire
different context i mean it's the same

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:42.830
different context i mean it's the same
 

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:44.140
different context i mean it's the same
information that we're going to present

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.150
information that we're going to present
 

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.600
information that we're going to present
through the application it's just a

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:46.610
through the application it's just a
 

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:48.490
through the application it's just a
completely different like visual

00:15:48.490 --> 00:15:48.500
completely different like visual
 

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:50.470
completely different like visual
treatment or priority as it were

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:50.480
treatment or priority as it were
 

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.269
treatment or priority as it were
so let's in the interest of time let's

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:52.279
so let's in the interest of time let's
 

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:54.579
so let's in the interest of time let's
skip through a few of these other

00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:54.589
skip through a few of these other
 

00:15:54.589 --> 00:15:57.009
skip through a few of these other
screens so this is basically the

00:15:57.009 --> 00:15:57.019
screens so this is basically the
 

00:15:57.019 --> 00:15:58.329
screens so this is basically the
portrait version and what we've done is

00:15:58.329 --> 00:15:58.339
portrait version and what we've done is
 

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:00.519
portrait version and what we've done is
we've we've really tried to think what

00:16:00.519 --> 00:16:00.529
we've we've really tried to think what
 

00:16:00.529 --> 00:16:02.739
we've we've really tried to think what
is this screen look like on multiple in

00:16:02.739 --> 00:16:02.749
is this screen look like on multiple in
 

00:16:02.749 --> 00:16:04.749
is this screen look like on multiple in
multiple orientations as well as on

00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759
multiple orientations as well as on
 

00:16:04.759 --> 00:16:06.849
multiple orientations as well as on
multiple sizes I mean it's it's not just

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:06.859
multiple sizes I mean it's it's not just
 

00:16:06.859 --> 00:16:09.189
multiple sizes I mean it's it's not just
a 10-inch landscape tablet world out

00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199
a 10-inch landscape tablet world out
 

00:16:09.199 --> 00:16:11.019
a 10-inch landscape tablet world out
there you know there's portrait devices

00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:11.029
there you know there's portrait devices
 

00:16:11.029 --> 00:16:12.639
there you know there's portrait devices
there are seven inch devices and they're

00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:12.649
there are seven inch devices and they're
 

00:16:12.649 --> 00:16:14.559
there are seven inch devices and they're
probably gonna you know vary in size and

00:16:14.559 --> 00:16:14.569
probably gonna you know vary in size and
 

00:16:14.569 --> 00:16:16.659
probably gonna you know vary in size and
screen resolution so this is just an

00:16:16.659 --> 00:16:16.669
screen resolution so this is just an
 

00:16:16.669 --> 00:16:18.009
screen resolution so this is just an
example of what a 10-inch portrait

00:16:18.009 --> 00:16:18.019
example of what a 10-inch portrait
 

00:16:18.019 --> 00:16:19.539
example of what a 10-inch portrait
mock-up can look like well basically

00:16:19.539 --> 00:16:19.549
mock-up can look like well basically
 

00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:22.299
mock-up can look like well basically
done is we've taken a linear approach to

00:16:22.299 --> 00:16:22.309
done is we've taken a linear approach to
 

00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:23.919
done is we've taken a linear approach to
to laying out this content so the

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:23.929
to laying out this content so the
 

00:16:23.929 --> 00:16:26.439
to laying out this content so the
hierarchy is still maintained the very

00:16:26.439 --> 00:16:26.449
hierarchy is still maintained the very
 

00:16:26.449 --> 00:16:28.359
hierarchy is still maintained the very
top most item is the most important

00:16:28.359 --> 00:16:28.369
top most item is the most important
 

00:16:28.369 --> 00:16:31.689
top most item is the most important
thing your calendar the second item the

00:16:31.689 --> 00:16:31.699
thing your calendar the second item the
 

00:16:31.699 --> 00:16:33.970
thing your calendar the second item the
second row in the screen is this

00:16:33.970 --> 00:16:33.980
second row in the screen is this
 

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:37.569
second row in the screen is this
horizontally palpable social feed and

00:16:37.569 --> 00:16:37.579
horizontally palpable social feed and
 

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:39.909
horizontally palpable social feed and
the presentation here I'll admit that

00:16:39.909 --> 00:16:39.919
the presentation here I'll admit that
 

00:16:39.919 --> 00:16:41.949
the presentation here I'll admit that
it's it's not really refined there's

00:16:41.949 --> 00:16:41.959
it's it's not really refined there's
 

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.769
it's it's not really refined there's
definitely a lot of work to be done here

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:43.779
definitely a lot of work to be done here
 

00:16:43.779 --> 00:16:46.030
definitely a lot of work to be done here
but I mean there's just one way you can

00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:46.040
but I mean there's just one way you can
 

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.829
but I mean there's just one way you can
you can start to think about this and

00:16:47.829 --> 00:16:47.839
you can start to think about this and
 

00:16:47.839 --> 00:16:50.949
you can start to think about this and
then that nearby routes section at the

00:16:50.949 --> 00:16:50.959
then that nearby routes section at the
 

00:16:50.959 --> 00:16:53.319
then that nearby routes section at the
bottom is still there so it's it's kind

00:16:53.319 --> 00:16:53.329
bottom is still there so it's it's kind
 

00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:54.699
bottom is still there so it's it's kind
of taking up the same amount of space as

00:16:54.699 --> 00:16:54.709
of taking up the same amount of space as
 

00:16:54.709 --> 00:16:56.229
of taking up the same amount of space as
it normally would but again these all

00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:56.239
it normally would but again these all
 

00:16:56.239 --> 00:16:59.439
it normally would but again these all
these sections are fairly flexible you

00:16:59.439 --> 00:16:59.449
these sections are fairly flexible you
 

00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:01.509
these sections are fairly flexible you
know you can potentially actually let me

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519
know you can potentially actually let me
 

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:03.629
know you can potentially actually let me
just talk about that in a bit

00:17:03.629 --> 00:17:03.639
just talk about that in a bit
 

00:17:03.639 --> 00:17:06.819
just talk about that in a bit
let's look at the the seven-inch layout

00:17:06.819 --> 00:17:06.829
let's look at the the seven-inch layout
 

00:17:06.829 --> 00:17:08.169
let's look at the the seven-inch layout
and this is where I wanted to mention

00:17:08.169 --> 00:17:08.179
and this is where I wanted to mention
 

00:17:08.179 --> 00:17:09.759
and this is where I wanted to mention
that you know that top section at

00:17:09.759 --> 00:17:09.769
that you know that top section at
 

00:17:09.769 --> 00:17:10.990
that you know that top section at
calendar it's flexible you can

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000
calendar it's flexible you can
 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.199
calendar it's flexible you can
potentially show another row of days at

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:14.209
potentially show another row of days at
 

00:17:14.209 --> 00:17:16.539
potentially show another row of days at
the bottom or the top in this case

00:17:16.539 --> 00:17:16.549
the bottom or the top in this case
 

00:17:16.549 --> 00:17:19.029
the bottom or the top in this case
you're seeing another row from February

00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039
you're seeing another row from February
 

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:20.590
you're seeing another row from February
and then you can you can scroll it you

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:20.600
and then you can you can scroll it you
 

00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.970
and then you can you can scroll it you
should be able to scroll up and down to

00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:21.980
should be able to scroll up and down to
 

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.090
should be able to scroll up and down to
change the the current month and then

00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:25.100
change the the current month and then
 

00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:26.889
change the the current month and then
you can rearrange the content from the

00:17:26.889 --> 00:17:26.899
you can rearrange the content from the
 

00:17:26.899 --> 00:17:28.840
you can rearrange the content from the
left to the bottom this the summary

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:28.850
left to the bottom this the summary
 

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.840
left to the bottom this the summary
section and the most important part of

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:31.850
section and the most important part of
 

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:33.730
section and the most important part of
the screen I guess is that you know on a

00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:33.740
the screen I guess is that you know on a
 

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.009
the screen I guess is that you know on a
7-inch Gy you don't necessarily have all

00:17:36.009 --> 00:17:36.019
7-inch Gy you don't necessarily have all
 

00:17:36.019 --> 00:17:39.310
7-inch Gy you don't necessarily have all
that space as you do on a 10-inch UI so

00:17:39.310 --> 00:17:39.320
that space as you do on a 10-inch UI so
 

00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.840
that space as you do on a 10-inch UI so
one of the things you can do for these

00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:40.850
one of the things you can do for these
 

00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:43.029

dashboard type screens is to switch over
into tabs and they should be

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:44.840
into tabs and they should be
 

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.190
into tabs and they should be
horizontally swipeable so you know since

00:17:48.190 --> 00:17:48.200
horizontally swipeable so you know since
 

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.320
horizontally swipeable so you know since
there's no real horizontal interaction

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:50.330
there's no real horizontal interaction
 

00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:52.389
there's no real horizontal interaction
here it should be fairly straightforward

00:17:52.389 --> 00:17:52.399
here it should be fairly straightforward
 

00:17:52.399 --> 00:17:54.850

it always dims the background so even if
the background was pure white the

00:23:10.030 --> 00:23:13.440
you well so that certain gourmet
community so the the code behind these

00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:13.450
community so the the code behind these
 

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:15.030
community so the the code behind these
I've definitely written up a bunch of

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:15.040
I've definitely written up a bunch of
 

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.860
I've definitely written up a bunch of
the kind of code snippets to show how to

00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:16.870
the kind of code snippets to show how to
 

00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:18.660
the kind of code snippets to show how to
implement this but they're really

00:23:18.660 --> 00:23:18.670
implement this but they're really
 

00:23:18.670 --> 00:23:20.670
implement this but they're really
following some of the design practices

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:20.680
following some of the design practices
 

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.430
following some of the design practices
from from Android apps front from I

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:23.440
from from Android apps front from I
 

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.260
from from Android apps front from I
guess first party apps from system apps

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:25.270
guess first party apps from system apps
 

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:28.110
guess first party apps from system apps
as well as from the community so but yes

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:28.120
as well as from the community so but yes
 

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.670
as well as from the community so but yes
we do have code samples for all these so

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:29.680
we do have code samples for all these so
 

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:30.990
we do have code samples for all these so
if you have questions on how do you

00:23:30.990 --> 00:23:31.000
if you have questions on how do you
 

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.630
if you have questions on how do you
actually get to implement these then let

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:33.640
actually get to implement these then let
 

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.510
actually get to implement these then let
us know after the show so first let's

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:36.520
us know after the show so first let's
 

00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:39.720
us know after the show so first let's
talk about done and discard we featured

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:39.730
talk about done and discard we featured
 

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.660
talk about done and discard we featured
this in the past basically it removes

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:42.670
this in the past basically it removes
 

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.930
this in the past basically it removes
the action bar entirely and replaces it

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:45.940
the action bar entirely and replaces it
 

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.840
the action bar entirely and replaces it
with a very similar looking done and

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:48.850
with a very similar looking done and
 

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:49.680
with a very similar looking done and
discard bar

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:49.690
discard bar
 

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.440
discard bar
so you know in really simple like in

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:52.450
so you know in really simple like in
 

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:53.790
so you know in really simple like in
simple screens where you're just you

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:53.800
simple screens where you're just you
 

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.340
simple screens where you're just you
know editing you know a form like

00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:56.350
know editing you know a form like
 

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.200
know editing you know a form like
filling out some simple information

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.210
filling out some simple information
 

00:23:58.210 --> 00:24:00.630
filling out some simple information
we're making some changes to a contact

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640
we're making some changes to a contact
 

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.990
we're making some changes to a contact
for example you know you could have like

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000
for example you know you could have like
 

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.030
for example you know you could have like
save and cancel and up and back

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:07.040
save and cancel and up and back
 

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.710
save and cancel and up and back
but what you know one of the

00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720
but what you know one of the
 

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.210
but what you know one of the
alternatives is really to just show this

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:10.220
alternatives is really to just show this
 

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.060
alternatives is really to just show this
very simple straightforward done and

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.070
very simple straightforward done and
 

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.250
very simple straightforward done and
discard or done and cancel a bar at the

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:15.260
discard or done and cancel a bar at the
 

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.700
discard or done and cancel a bar at the
top I guess do you guys have any other

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:18.710
top I guess do you guys have any other
 

00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:20.410
top I guess do you guys have any other
comments on this I mean it's we've

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:20.420
comments on this I mean it's we've
 

00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.510
comments on this I mean it's we've
talked about in the past but yeah I like

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:22.520
talked about in the past but yeah I like
 

00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:24.070
talked about in the past but yeah I like
it it looks it's completely unambiguous

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080
it it looks it's completely unambiguous
 

00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.530
it it looks it's completely unambiguous
as to what's gonna happen right yeah you

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:26.540
as to what's gonna happen right yeah you
 

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.230
as to what's gonna happen right yeah you
can I feel it stays true to kind of what

00:24:29.230 --> 00:24:29.240
can I feel it stays true to kind of what
 

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:31.570
can I feel it stays true to kind of what
the action bar offers but this visual

00:24:31.570 --> 00:24:31.580
the action bar offers but this visual
 

00:24:31.580 --> 00:24:33.040
the action bar offers but this visual
treatment just makes it super clear

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:33.050
treatment just makes it super clear
 

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:34.930
treatment just makes it super clear
what's gonna happen yeah there's an

00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:34.940
what's gonna happen yeah there's an
 

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.250
what's gonna happen yeah there's an
alternative where the done button

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:36.260
alternative where the done button
 

00:24:36.260 --> 00:24:39.130
alternative where the done button
appears in the top left and then discard

00:24:39.130 --> 00:24:39.140
appears in the top left and then discard
 

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:41.310
appears in the top left and then discard
is something like in the action overflow

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:41.320
is something like in the action overflow
 

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.650
is something like in the action overflow
and that's more useful if you have other

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:44.660
and that's more useful if you have other
 

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:46.240
and that's more useful if you have other
actions that you want to show besides

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.250
actions that you want to show besides
 

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:49.600
actions that you want to show besides
just done discard them and cancel or if

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:49.610
just done discard them and cancel or if
 

00:24:49.610 --> 00:24:51.850
just done discard them and cancel or if
you really don't expect or don't want

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:51.860
you really don't expect or don't want
 

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.310
you really don't expect or don't want
people to cancel like if it's like if

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:54.320
people to cancel like if it's like if
 

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.990
people to cancel like if it's like if
you're saving a contact chances already

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000
you're saving a contact chances already
 

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.880
you're saving a contact chances already
in it you know make it make the change

00:24:57.880 --> 00:24:57.890
in it you know make it make the change
 

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.190
in it you know make it make the change
yeah I think that means that's a good

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:00.200
yeah I think that means that's a good
 

00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.510
yeah I think that means that's a good
point for example take a look at I think

00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:01.520
point for example take a look at I think
 

00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.490
point for example take a look at I think
in the system and the people out looking

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:03.500
in the system and the people out looking
 

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:05.260
in the system and the people out looking
at something about creating a contact

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:05.270
at something about creating a contact
 

00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:06.790
at something about creating a contact
and I think also the same that I created

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:06.800
and I think also the same that I created
 

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.190
and I think also the same that I created
calendar event right in the examples of

00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:09.200
calendar event right in the examples of
 

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.170
calendar event right in the examples of
this yeah I was just gonna say that that

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:11.180
this yeah I was just gonna say that that
 

00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:12.610
this yeah I was just gonna say that that
other form sort of makes them more

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620
other form sort of makes them more
 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.290
other form sort of makes them more
obvious what say getting the back but I

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:14.300
obvious what say getting the back but I
 

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.180
obvious what say getting the back but I
might do like it would obviously save

00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:16.190
might do like it would obviously save
 

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:20.470
might do like it would obviously save
the content yeah in that case okay so

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480
the content yeah in that case okay so
 

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.960
the content yeah in that case okay so
done in this card that's one we

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:22.970
done in this card that's one we
 

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:25.360
done in this card that's one we
recommend this for kind of again simple

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:25.370
recommend this for kind of again simple
 

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:28.180
recommend this for kind of again simple
editing forms you know the screens that

00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:28.190
editing forms you know the screens that
 

00:25:28.190 --> 00:25:29.260
editing forms you know the screens that
you're really just editing a piece of

00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:29.270
you're really just editing a piece of
 

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:30.670
you're really just editing a piece of
content maybe not something that's

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:30.680
content maybe not something that's
 

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:34.780
content maybe not something that's
terribly complex then pinning progress

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:34.790
terribly complex then pinning progress
 

00:25:34.790 --> 00:25:37.090
terribly complex then pinning progress
and this is something that I'll very

00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:37.100
and this is something that I'll very
 

00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:39.490
and this is something that I'll very
briefly cover because it's it's kind of

00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:39.500
briefly cover because it's it's kind of
 

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.830
briefly cover because it's it's kind of
less often used and ideally you know you

00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840
less often used and ideally you know you
 

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.600
less often used and ideally you know you
save everything to your device you know

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:43.610
save everything to your device you know
 

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:45.280
save everything to your device you know
you cache everything and cache

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:45.290
you cache everything and cache
 

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:47.260
you cache everything and cache
opportunistically but you know in cases

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:47.270
opportunistically but you know in cases
 

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.210
opportunistically but you know in cases
of you know where you have movies or

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:49.220
of you know where you have movies or
 

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.210
of you know where you have movies or
large files where it's clear that the

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:52.220
large files where it's clear that the
 

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.280
large files where it's clear that the
action of caching or saving to your

00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:54.290
action of caching or saving to your
 

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:56.980
action of caching or saving to your
device is pretty heavyweight you may

00:25:56.980 --> 00:25:56.990
device is pretty heavyweight you may
 

00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:58.750
device is pretty heavyweight you may
want to give the user an explicit way to

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760
want to give the user an explicit way to
 

00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:03.010
want to give the user an explicit way to
you know to save or to to pin content

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:03.020
you know to save or to to pin content
 

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.960
you know to save or to to pin content
from the cloud on to your device and so

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:04.970
from the cloud on to your device and so
 

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.120
from the cloud on to your device and so
this is this is basically a little UI

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:07.130
this is this is basically a little UI
 

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.150
this is this is basically a little UI
element this little pin button is kind

00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:10.160
element this little pin button is kind
 

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:12.040
element this little pin button is kind
of like a checkbox where you know if

00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:12.050
of like a checkbox where you know if
 

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.950
of like a checkbox where you know if
it's check then this should be pinned

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960
it's check then this should be pinned
 

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.060
it's check then this should be pinned
and then in the background it shows the

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:15.070
and then in the background it shows the
 

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.399
and then in the background it shows the
progress of the pinning so if it's like

00:26:17.399 --> 00:26:17.409
progress of the pinning so if it's like
 

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.980
progress of the pinning so if it's like
a 300 Meg download and you've you know

00:26:19.980 --> 00:26:19.990
a 300 Meg download and you've you know
 

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:21.510
a 300 Meg download and you've you know
the app is downloaded you know two

00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520
the app is downloaded you know two
 

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.389
the app is downloaded you know two
hundred Meg's then you know this should

00:26:24.389 --> 00:26:24.399
hundred Meg's then you know this should
 

00:26:24.399 --> 00:26:25.710
hundred Meg's then you know this should
this pie chart should be you know

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:25.720
this pie chart should be you know
 

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.299
this pie chart should be you know
somewhere about two-thirds of the way

00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:27.309
somewhere about two-thirds of the way
 

00:26:27.309 --> 00:26:31.440
somewhere about two-thirds of the way
full so very very simple little UI

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:31.450
full so very very simple little UI
 

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:32.669
full so very very simple little UI
widget that you can use throughout your

00:26:32.669 --> 00:26:32.679
widget that you can use throughout your
 

00:26:32.679 --> 00:26:33.930
