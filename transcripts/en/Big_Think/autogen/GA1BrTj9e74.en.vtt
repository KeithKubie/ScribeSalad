think very few of us expected

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410
think very few of us expected
 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.410
think very few of us expected
you know when the concepts of cloud

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420
you know when the concepts of cloud
 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.140
you know when the concepts of cloud
computing first developed we saw miss

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
computing first developed we saw miss
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.580

very different than the traditional data

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590
very different than the traditional data
 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.919

center so it's like Amazon and Google

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
center so it's like Amazon and Google
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.560

and Rackspace you know building these

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570
and Rackspace you know building these
 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.340
and Rackspace you know building these
data centers you know away and you could

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350
data centers you know away and you could
 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.279
data centers you know away and you could
buy Elastic Compute etc etc and then you

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289
buy Elastic Compute etc etc and then you
 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.080
buy Elastic Compute etc etc and then you
had the traditional data center and so

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090
had the traditional data center and so
 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.300
had the traditional data center and so
there's been an ongoing dialogue for the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
there's been an ongoing dialogue for the
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.650
there's been an ongoing dialogue for the
last several years well winner people

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660
last several years well winner people
 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.849

are going to move to the cloud is that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
are going to move to the cloud is that
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.580
are going to move to the cloud is that
going to be the predominant model what I

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590
going to be the predominant model what I
 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.500
going to be the predominant model what I
think we're actually finding now is

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
think we're actually finding now is
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.810
think we're actually finding now is
those models are converging there is

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820
those models are converging there is
 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819
those models are converging there is
going to be no is this a cloud

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829
going to be no is this a cloud
 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.830
going to be no is this a cloud
application is this something that's in

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840
application is this something that's in
 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.869
application is this something that's in
a traditional data center a lot of

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879
a traditional data center a lot of
 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.369
a traditional data center a lot of
exciting things happening about how

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379
exciting things happening about how
 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.900
exciting things happening about how
applications are being built and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
applications are being built and
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.729
applications are being built and
deployed around containers and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739
deployed around containers and
 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799
deployed around containers and
elasticity on-premise when you talk

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809
elasticity on-premise when you talk
 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.209
elasticity on-premise when you talk
about a lot of those things but

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219
about a lot of those things but
 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.490
about a lot of those things but
fundamentally what we're seeing is a

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
fundamentally what we're seeing is a
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.310
fundamentally what we're seeing is a

companies that I talked to so very very

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
companies that I talked to so very very
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.049
companies that I talked to so very very
large companies will typically say I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
large companies will typically say I
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810

like public cloud to do development

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
like public cloud to do development
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.780
like public cloud to do development
tests or applications that I don't know

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
tests or applications that I don't know
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.190
tests or applications that I don't know
what their initial demands going to be

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200
what their initial demands going to be
 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.530
what their initial demands going to be
and let them burst out for a while and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540
and let them burst out for a while and
 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.300
and let them burst out for a while and
they may get small again and I may want

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310
they may get small again and I may want
 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070
they may get small again and I may want
to tear them down and they like public

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080
to tear them down and they like public
 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.890
to tear them down and they like public
cloud for that because it's easy to

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900
cloud for that because it's easy to
 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.649
cloud for that because it's easy to
spool up new compute network storage

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
spool up new compute network storage
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.929
spool up new compute network storage
power it's easy to scale it's easy to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
power it's easy to scale it's easy to
 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.789
power it's easy to scale it's easy to
pull it down but what I also hear from

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799
pull it down but what I also hear from
 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.469
pull it down but what I also hear from
those same large enterprises

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
those same large enterprises
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.060
those same large enterprises
Wow once that applications up and

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
Wow once that applications up and
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.920
Wow once that applications up and
running and I have a sense of you know

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930
running and I have a sense of you know
 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.080
running and I have a sense of you know
how much compute resources is going to

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090
how much compute resources is going to
 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.899
how much compute resources is going to
require and I have a good sense of is

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909
require and I have a good sense of is
 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.700
require and I have a good sense of is
that gonna vary much it's much cheaper

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710
that gonna vary much it's much cheaper
 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.950
that gonna vary much it's much cheaper
to run in my traditional data center so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
to run in my traditional data center so
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.899
to run in my traditional data center so
I think the big problem now that people

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909
I think the big problem now that people
 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.030
I think the big problem now that people
are struggling with with containers and

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040
are struggling with with containers and
 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.950
are struggling with with containers and
other technologies is how do I build an

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
other technologies is how do I build an
 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.780
other technologies is how do I build an
application portfolio that may run in

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790
application portfolio that may run in
 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.460
application portfolio that may run in
the cloud but may also run in a very

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470
the cloud but may also run in a very
 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410
the cloud but may also run in a very
traditional data center and how do you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
traditional data center and how do you
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.149
traditional data center and how do you
build a structure a to build

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159
build a structure a to build
 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.830
build a structure a to build
applications that can run across those

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840
applications that can run across those
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740
applications that can run across those
models and but also to monitor them and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
models and but also to monitor them and
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.310
models and but also to monitor them and
manage them and decide when is this more

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320
manage them and decide when is this more
 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.359
manage them and decide when is this more
appropriate to run a public cloud and

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
appropriate to run a public cloud and
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.969
appropriate to run a public cloud and
when is it more appropriate to run in a

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979
when is it more appropriate to run in a
 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440
when is it more appropriate to run in a
private cloud or in a traditional

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450
private cloud or in a traditional
 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.260
private cloud or in a traditional
infrastructure so I think the whole

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270
infrastructure so I think the whole
 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.850
infrastructure so I think the whole
bifurcation of cloud versus not what

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
bifurcation of cloud versus not what
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.740
bifurcation of cloud versus not what
we're finding is it's all one thing it's

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
we're finding is it's all one thing it's
 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.660
we're finding is it's all one thing it's
a continuum and people are different

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670
a continuum and people are different
 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.880
a continuum and people are different
places on that continuum

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
places on that continuum
 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.700
places on that continuum
even with different implications in the

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710
even with different implications in the
 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.530
even with different implications in the
same portfolio of applications in the

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540
same portfolio of applications in the
 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.950
same portfolio of applications in the
same Enterprise IT shop
