00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.880
Hi, I’m John Green, this is CrashCourse
U.S. history, and today we have finally reached

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.990
the Clinton years.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.380
Bill Clinton and I are really quite similar,
actually.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.620
We were both brought up in the South.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.750
We both come from broken families … well,
no, not actually.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.680
Also, I did not attended any Ivy League University.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.300
Yeah, I’m actually nothing like Bill Clinton.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.670
Well, except for the southern thing, and also
both of us are married to women who are smarter

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:21.670
than we are.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:22.670
Mr. Green, Mr. Green?

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:23.670
But he was president.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.689
Whatever, I’m still young Me From the Past!

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:36.790
Clinton wasn’t even governor of Arkansas
until he was like (looks at computer)....oh,

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.603
crap, he was 32, I’m finished!

00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:42.850
INTRO
So Clinton’s presidency was focused on Domestic

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.690
Policy and a sex scandal – in fact his campaign
war room famously featured a sign that read

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.940
“It’s the Economy, stupid.”

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.110
His domestic legacy is pretty complex, though,
so we’re going to start with his foreign

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.110
policy.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.870
The Clinton years didn’t feature as many
major foreign policy successes as Bush 41,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.460
but Clinton did have his moments.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.220
Like his administration achieved a partial
success with the 1993 Oslo Accords when Israel

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.539
recognized the legitimacy of the Palestinian
Liberation Organisation.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.710
However, that eventually resulted in the PLO
becoming progressively less powerful and as

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.090
you may have noticed, it didn’t ultimately
achieve peace in the Middle East.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.280
Clinton was more successful in Yugoslavia
where he pushed NATO to actually do something

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.499
for once in this case bombing, sending troops,
kinda something.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.909
Now there had been widespread ethnic cleansing
of Bosnian Muslims before the NATO intervention

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.219
but the fighting ended with the Dayton Accords.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.719
And then there’s the Rwandan genocide, which
the Clinton administration did absolutely

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.390
nothing to prevent and where 800,000 people
died in less than a month.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.509
The Rwandan genocide is probably the international
community's greatest failure in the 2nd half

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.350
of the 20th century and while certainly Clinton
was among many people who were complicit to

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.700
that including like, me, yeah… you know...
so far it’s not such a great foreign policy

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:52.700
record.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.259
Terrorism also became a bigger issue during
Clinton’s presidency.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.079
The World Trade Center was bombed for the
1st time, the U.S.S. Cole was attacked.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:02.689
But the most destructive terrorist act during
Clinton’s presidency was of course committed

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.649
by Americans - Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols
who blew up the Murrah Federal building in

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:08.649
Oklahoma City.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.750
Which brings us to an awkward transition from
domestic terrorism to domestic policy.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.190
So Bill Clinton was from Hope Arkansas and
he ran as a centrist democrat who wanted to

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.750
do things differently.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.210
He wasn’t going to be inside the Washington
beltway.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.940
And he wasn’t going to be some old-fashioned
liberal who was all about raising taxes funneling

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.880
billions of dollars to Snuffleupagus.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.700
That centrism made him very electable but
his first few domestic agenda items faltered,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.700
like he tried to end the ban on gay people
entering in the military but opposition led

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.640
him to compromise with the famous Don’t
Ask Don’t Tell policy.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.600
Essentially you were allowed to be homosexual,
if you were in the military, you just weren’t

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.960
allowed to acknowledge it.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.170
And then there was the 1993 Health Care initiative
led by Clinton’s wife, Hillary, which was

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.170
also a failure.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.230
By the 90’s the United States was the last
industrialized nation not to have universal

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.170
health care and while Hillary Clinton’s
plan would have resulted in Americans having

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.800
universal health care it was too complicated
to sell to us.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:07.070
Also, it faced very powerful opposition from
like drug companies, and insurers, and medical

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:08.450
device makers… lots of people.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.330
But at least it had a working website.

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.100
What’s that, Stan?

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.640
There was no web?

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.460
What did they use, like a mobile app or something?

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.460
There was no apps?

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.670
I thought we were in modern history!

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.210
So on the heels of these failed policy initiatives
in 1994 Democrats were swept out of Congress

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.710
and Republicans took control of both the Senate
and the House.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.200
The new speaker of the House, whose real name
was Newt Gingrich, and who would later run

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.930
for president despite being named Newt Gingrich
issued something called the Contract with

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.930
America.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.790
It promised to cut government, cut taxes,
cut regulation, overhaul welfare and end affirmative

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.570
action -- and this led to a Government shutdown
in 1995 over an inability to reach a budget

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.220
agreement between the Congress and the president.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.370
Which in turn made all these new Congressional
Republicans very unpopular with the American

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.160
people as a whole and played into Clinton’s
political strategy of “triangulation.”

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.380
His strategy was to campaign against radical
republicans while co-opting some of their

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380
ideas.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.270
The most obvious example was his declaration
in January 1996 that “The era of big government

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:13.270
is over”.

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:14.720
Spoiler alert: It wasn’t.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.280
There has been no president since WWII who
decreased the size of the government.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.350
And that will change when never because all
of the things that actually cost the government

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.560
a lot of money like Social Security and Medicare
are very popular and both of those programs

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.410
benefit old people who vote disproportionately
because they have nothing to do since Murder

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.530
She Wrote was cancelled.

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:39.200
However, Clinton did actually shrink parts
of the government with policies like the Telecommunications

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.010
Act of 1996, which deregulated broadcasting.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:47.590
But Clinton’s signature economic policy
was Welfare Reform – aka the Personal Responsibility

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.770
and Work Opportunity Act – of 1996.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.280
This law replaced the Aid to Families with
Dependent Children program, which had given

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.170
money directly to poor mothers.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.060
But with Clinton’s welfare reform states
received block grants that came with strings

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.780
attached including work requirements and time
limits for total benefits.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.160
Welfare rolls plummeted and many economists
see this as the rare bipartisan victory in

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.530
the 1990’s but it’s still controversial
and many liberal people felt like Bill Clinton

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.590
had betrayed them.

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.990
But Clinton still remained popular through
much of his presidency largely because it

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.650
really is the economy stupid - and the economy
got better.

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:27.410
In fact by the time Clinton left office unemployment
was below 4% which hadn’t happened since

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:28.410
the 1960s.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.990
That meant there should have been inflation
but somehow there wasn’t, possibly because

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.050
of increased global competition that kept
wages down and also energy prices that were

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.550
remarkably low as worldwide oil production
increased.

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:42.960
Microchips made it possible to develop loads
of new products, like personal computers and

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.139
DVD players, and video games, and cell phones,
and Crash Course.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.060
And computers completely transformed the American
workplace.

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.400
I mean until the 90’s people would go to
work, and they would sit in their offices

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.400
at their desks, and they would…

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.970
I don’t know what did because they didn’t
have computers!

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.550
How did anything get done before computers,
I mean how were books written, how was the

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:06.950
Godfather edited, how was this globe made,
I mean did some individual’s human hand

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.350
sculpt it from clay?

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.400
So no wonder the economy got better we had
stumbled on the biggest innovation since like

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.400
wheels.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.790
And during the Clinton administration we didn’t
just have computers we had computers that

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.400
began to connect to each other.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.680
I’m referring of course to the Internet
which might have remained like a military

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.449
communications network if computer scientists
and entrepreneurs hadn’t worked out how

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:27.480
to use it to sell things.

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.590
This was the beginning of the e-commerce boom,
which would be followed by an e-commerce bust,

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.510
but then another e-commerce boom, which would
eventually give us websites where you can

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:40.980
buy Crash Course DVD’s, like DFTBA.com,
and also lesser known e-commerce sites like

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:41.980
Ebay and Amazon.

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:44.740
Oh, it’s time for the mystery document?

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:47.250
The rules here are simple.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.710
I read the mystery document, I either get
the author correct, or I get shocked.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.840
Okay here we go.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.169
“The information highway will extend the
electronic marketplace and make it the ultimate

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:00.050
go-between, the universal middleman.

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:04.520
Often the only humans involved in a transaction
will be the actual buyer and the seller.

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.960
All the goods for sale in the world will be
available for you to examine, compare, and

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.580
often customize.

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:13.490
When you want to buy something you’ll be
able to tell your computer to find if for

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:18.570
you at the best price offered by any acceptable
source or ask your computer to “haggle”

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.919
with the computers of various sellers.

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:24.389
Information about vendors and their products
and services will be available to any computer

00:07:24.389 --> 00:07:26.110
connected to the highway.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:31.490
Servers distributed worldwide will accept
bids, resolve offers into completed transactions,

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:36.120
control authentication and security, and handle
all other aspects of the marketplace, including

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.650
the transfer of funds.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.490
This will carry us into a new world of low-friction,
low-overhead capitalism, in which market information

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:46.680
will be plentiful and transaction costs low.

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:48.550
It will be a shopper’s heaven.”

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:53.370
Stan, that sounds like something that Amazon
founder Jeff Bezos would say.

00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:54.370
No?

00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.370
Dangit, Bill Gates.

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:59.940
Let me tell you how much I enjoy this, none.

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.650
Oh, the information super highway it made
all of this possible including my shock pen.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:06.650
Ahhh!

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.930
Now one of the lessons of history is that
good news for someone is almost always bad

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:15.139
news for someone else and that was certainly
the case with the longest period of economic

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:17.020
expansion in American history.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.419
Increased use of Information Technology facilitated
the globalization of manufacturing and the

00:08:21.419 --> 00:08:26.790
pressure to manufacture cheaply pushed wages
down and encouraged companies to locate factories

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:30.470
in countries with lower environmental regulations
and also lower wages.

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:34.140
That’s great for companies, it’s good
for prices, arguably good for workers in the

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:38.570
developing world, not so great for the environment
or for American workers.

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:42.550
The deregulation of finance also contributed
to global growth.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.050
Capital could flow more easily anywhere in
the world but this also meant that it could

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:51.360
flow out easily, making financial crises more
likely and more widespread.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.880
The growth of free flowing capital in the
1990’s created a world in which the crash

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.270
of 2008 was more or less inevitable.

00:08:58.270 --> 00:09:00.810
But before that we had the crash of 2000.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.380
As money flowed into the stock market, bubbles
developed.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:06.860
And in some ways this was more problematic
than it used to be because a much greater

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.790
percentage of Americans had become investors
in stocks - an actual majority of them by

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:12.980
the year 2000.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:17.060
And many of these investors were buying into
these hot new dot-com stocks, in fact the

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:21.200
tech-heavy NASDAQ exchange soared in 1998
and 1999.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:25.240
And then it lost 80% of its value in 2000
when the bubble burst.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.190
It turns out that the Pets.com business model
of selling you dog food at a loss is not a

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:31.550
sustainable business model.

00:09:31.550 --> 00:09:35.130
Although to be fair Amazon has been selling
stuff at a loss now for 20 years and they’re

00:09:35.130 --> 00:09:36.130
still at it.

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.180
So… you know… maybe I’m wrong.

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:41.990
So during this period real wages grew but
the gains were very unequal like when you

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:47.510
adjust for inflation, wages of nonsupervisory
workers remained below what they were in the

00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.510
1970s.

00:09:48.510 --> 00:09:50.370
And for the poor it was even worse.

00:09:50.370 --> 00:09:56.360
Our old friend Eric Foner reports that “Average
after-tax income of the poorest 1/5 of Americans

00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.290
fell 12 percent, and that of the middle 1/5
decreased by 3 percent.”[1] Meanwhile, the

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:03.560
income of the top fifth increased 38%.

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:09.020
Now of course this trend towards inequality
and the majority of jobs being created in

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:13.460
low wage, insecure, service industries would
continue into the 21st century.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:16.740
But the economic and political pictures that
we’ve sought to paint only tell half of

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:21.180
the story of the 1990s, because it was also
a decade characterized by what has been called

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.360
the Culture Wars.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:26.810
A big part of this was immigration, which
rose enormously after immigration reform in

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.000
1965.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.510
Between 1965 and 2000 the US saw almost 24
million immigrants arrive, compared with 27

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:37.990
million during the peak immigration period
between 1880 and 1924.

00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:43.430
Fully half of new immigrants came from Latin
America and the Caribbean, 35% came from Asia,

00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:48.290
only 10% came from Europe and most of them
were from the former USSR and the Balkans.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.751
As had always been the case, most immigrants
were attracted by labor opportunities, but

00:10:51.751 --> 00:10:53.920
now more were highly educated.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.460
In fact, 40% had college educations.

00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:58.020
Let’s go to the thoughtbubble.

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.220
Latinos were the largest immigrant group by
far, with Mexicans making up the largest contingent

00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:07.450
and by 2007 Latinos would replace African
Americans as the second largest ethnic group.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:11.560
Latinos suffered disproportionate poverty,
and, despite significant economic gains during

00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:16.160
the 1990s, African Americans still found their
economic opportunities limited.

00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.550
According to Eric Foner, “In 2007, the total
assets of the median white family […] stood

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:21.660
at $87,000.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:27.510
For black families, the figure was $5,400.”[2]
Diversity also increased in other ways like

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:32.640
single parent families became more accepted
which was essential as 50% of marriages ended

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.640
in divorce.

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:38.070
Out-of-wedlock births declined, primarily
because teenagers were practicing safer sex.

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:43.430
And teens and adults were cohabiting before
or instead of marriage.

00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:48.500
Eventually the Mom, Dad, and 2.4 kids standard
American household became only one of a number

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.590
of accepted options for families.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.500
Gay and trans people became increasingly visible
in the national consciousness as a result

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:59.060
of the GLBT rights movement and it becoming
safer for people to come out of the closet.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.661
On the other hand, the AIDS epidemic, which
disproportionately affected the GLBT community

00:12:03.661 --> 00:12:04.899
was disastrous.

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:08.660
By 2000 400,000 Americans had died of AIDS.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.360
Then there’s the depressing rise in imprisonment.

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.340
Politicians competed with each other to see
who could be tougher on crime and as the War

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:19.779
on Drugs continued, many state legislatures
passed “three strikes” laws meaning that

00:12:19.779 --> 00:12:23.089
people who were convicted of three felonies
would go to prison for life.

00:12:23.089 --> 00:12:25.500
The number of Americans in prison skyrocketed.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:33.540
By 2008 it was 2.3 million, ONE QUARTER of
the total number of inmates on planet Earth.

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.540
Thanks, thoughtbubble.

00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:38.310
Although I have to say I thought this was
going to be a happy one, I mean the economy

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:43.390
is growing, things are getting better for
people in the GLBTQ community, and then boom,

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:44.870
boom, boom, it’s all terrible!

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:48.870
I don’t want to underplay the many benefits
of our increased prosperity and diversity

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:53.490
but all of this multiculturalism and change
made for a very tense political atmosphere.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:58.750
To some people it seemed like the open free-wheeling
liberalism of the 60’s had run amuck, and

00:12:58.750 --> 00:13:01.720
those people really started to hate the Clintons.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:07.090
But among Bill Clinton’s many flaws: facelessness,
cigar smoking, his biggest was his inability

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.060
to stop cheating on his wife.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.310
Clinton had dodged accusations of extramarital
skoodilypooping while running for the presidential

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.080
nomination which contributed to his unfortunate
“Slick Willie” moniker.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.740
But while he was president, Clinton’s former
employee Paula Jones sued him for sexual harassment

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:26.620
that had occurred, allegedly occurred, I guess
it probably occurred, allegedly occurred while

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:28.050
he was governor of Arkansas.

00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.740
While gathering evidence for that lawsuit,
investigators discovered that the president

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:36.370
had carried on a sexual relationship with
a young intern named Monica Lewinsky.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:42.140
The President denied having “sexual relations”
with Monica Lewinsky which was a lie unless

00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:47.990
you are President Bill Clinton and have a
very narrow definition of “sexual relations.”

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:51.540
That lie to a justice department official
was the basis for articles of impeachment

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:53.790
for perjury and obstruction of justice.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.240
And so it was that the president of the United
States was impeached for saying that he didn’t

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.310
have sex with a woman that he did have sex
with, unless of course you define sex very

00:14:02.310 --> 00:14:06.670
narrowly, and it all depends on what your
definition of is is, and etc.

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:10.820
In early 1999, Clinton was acquitted of these
charges in a congressional vote that went

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:15.410
right down party lines and he served out the
remainder of his term but he was significantly

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:16.410
weakened.

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:19.060
Also, he served out the remainder of his presidency
sleeping on the couch.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:24.760
So the 90s were a really pivotal decade to
the world we live in right now, a globalized,

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:29.329
multicultural, instagram-filtered world
But as we became more globally connected political

00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:31.480
divisions grew within the United States.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.340
And this became especially problematic because
with the growth of the Internet it was easier

00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:39.660
than ever to only hear voices that you already
know you agree with.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:44.820
To live inside of an echo chamber where your
news doesn’t necessarily resemble your neighbor’s

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:45.820
news.

00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:50.410
In some ways Bill Clinton directed these changes
but in most ways they directed him.

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:53.930
But that’s what I find so fascinating about
history, even the fancy people who get their

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.649
heads on the chalkboard, even they are subject
to historical forces.

00:14:58.649 --> 00:14:59.649
Thanks for watching.

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.240
