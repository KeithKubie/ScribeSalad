00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:43.850
A briefcase full of 
cash is a trope so common that even TV Tropes,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.230
a website dedicated to cataloguing cinematic
cliches, requests that users only mention

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.629
“exceptions, parodies and subversions”.

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.199
While you’d expect something so ridiculous
to be an invention, or at the very least an

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.059
exaggeration, of Hollywood, it appears that
paying for things with a big ol’ stack of

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.989
cash stored conveniently inside of a briefcase
is more common than you’d think.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.939
In fact, during our research we very easily
found many dozens of documented examples of

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.960
exactly this happening, some of the more interesting
of which we’d like to share now.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.310
While you’d expect exchanges involving briefcases
full of cash to be near-exclusively done by

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.399
seedy underworld types, that’s not really
the case.

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:24.399
Before we continue, yes, that was a briefcase
pun.

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.960
For example, in 2013 George Clooney (yes,
that George Clooney) gathered up 14 of his

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.170
closest friends and presented each one of
them with a briefcase containing exactly $1

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.679
million in cash.

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.599
The star explained to his stunned friends
that the money was a gift to thank them for

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.450
their support when he was just a struggling
actor, reportedly stating:

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.849
Listen, I want you guys to know how much you’ve
meant to me, and how much you mean to me in

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:48.849
my life.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.941
I came to L.A., I slept on your couch.

00:01:50.941 --> 00:01:55.039
I’m so fortunate in my life to have all
of you, and I couldn’t be where I am today

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.159
without all of you.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.539
So, it was really important to me that, while
we’re still all here together, that I give

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:01.539
back…

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.979
I know we’ve all been through some hard
times, some of you are still going through

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:05.979
it…

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.399
You don’t have to worry about your kids;
you don’t have to worry about school; you

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.820
don’t have to worry about paying your mortgage.

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.010
According to one of the recipients of the
money, Rande Gerber, Clooney went as far to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.599
pay all of the associated taxes on the gift
so that each man got to keep 100% of the cash

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.070
for themselves.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.810
George Clooney is just that kind of guy apparently.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.180
On the other end of the financial spectrum,
you have Luq Mughal, a student at the University

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:35.459
of Utah who in 2014 paid a $2000 tuition bill
with two thousand one dollar bills stored

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.459
inside of a briefcase.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.719
This act was to protest the soaring cost of
higher education in the United States.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:46.099
Sticking with protesting, there are many examples
of people taking advantage of the U.S. law

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.599
that dictates that any debt (regardless of
size) that the debtor attempts to settle with

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.700
cold hard cash cannot be refused.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.219
The specific law is U.S. Code Title 31 §5103,
which states in part,

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.719
United States coins and currency (including
Federal reserve notes and circulating notes

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:05.120
of Federal reserve banks and national banks)
are legal tender for all debts, public charges,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.670
taxes, and dues…

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.200
Thus, if you have a particularly huge bill
and wish to pay in relatively small denominations

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.069
just to annoy or otherwise waste the time
of a business, a briefcase full of $1 bills,

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.719
or perhaps a barrel full of pennies, is a
great way to go about it.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:25.389
Although, just as effective at annoying people
is that time a man paid a $137 traffic ticket

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:32.239
with individual dollar bills folded into origami
pigs stored inside of donut boxes.

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:39.180
(See: What Started the Cops Eating Donuts
Stereotype?)

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.329
Getting back to briefcases full of money,
in the early 1990s Black Sabbath guitarist

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.389
Tony Iommi was arrested in Sacramento for
non-payment of child support while the band

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:49.389
was on tour.

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.420
After being informed that his bail had been
set at $75,000, the band’s managers sent

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.670
a lawyer with a briefcase containing that
amount of money in cash to the jail in order

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.620
to expedite his release so the night’s show
didn’t have to be canceled.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.920
An individual known for making extensive use
of briefcases full of money is controversial

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.920
boxing promoter Don King.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.599
Specifically, it’s claimed that King would
often use just this tactic to get young boxers

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.249
to take him on as a manager.

00:04:14.249 --> 00:04:18.030
At the sight of such a large amount of cash,
this would invariably make the boxer less

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.950
hesitant to sign a contract with sometimes
wildly unfavourable terms for the young athlete.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.080
On one occasion, King reportedly even managed
to convince the late, great Muhammad Ali to

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.920
drop a court case by having an associate deliver
a briefcase containing $50,000 in cash to

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.920
the boxer.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.530
Despite being owed over $1 million after King
shortchanged him on his winnings in a 1980

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.390
boxing match, Ali agreed to drop a case he
likely would have easily won upon laying eyes

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.390
on the money.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.621
Needless to say, Ali’s lawyers who weren’t
around when said briefcase full of cash deal

00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.950
was presented were none too pleased when they
found out what had happened.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.450
In the world of soccer, this tactic was reportedly
used (unsuccessfully) to convince an, at the

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.410
time, 15 year old John Obi Mikel to sign with
a team he failed to recall during a later

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:02.530
interview with The Sun.

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.680
Mikel claims he was initially tempted to sign
the contract on the spot thanks to the briefcase

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:12.040
full of cash, but wisely changed his mind
and decided to delay to think it over.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.590
Moving on to other forms of entertainment,
briefcases full of cash have commonly featured

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:21.110
as prizes in gameshows and, on one notable
occasion in 2005, a documentary called Reversal

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.110
of Fortune.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.850
In regards to the latter, the subject of the
documentary, a homeless man called Ted Rodrigue,

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:31.560
was gifted $100,000 by producers just to see
what he’d do with the money.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.080
Rather than simply giving the money to Rodrigue,
they instead decided that it’d look better

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.520
for cameras to hide it inside the briefcase
which they arranged for Rodrigue to find while

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.640
dumpster diving.

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.170
Understandably, Rodrigue initially wanted
nothing to do with the money believing it

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.590
was linked to organised crime and had to be
assured by producers that the money was really

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.470
from them and his to keep.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.830
For anyone interested in what happened next,
we’ve covered the documentary in more detail

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.190
in a previous article.

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.050
Moving on to the world of business, in 2013,
to drum up interest in a crowdfunding website

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.220
he’d recently invested in called FundAnything.com,
Donald Trump gave away three briefcases full

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:13.330
of cash to random people from the lobby of
Trump Tower in New York.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:17.860
The publicity stunt, which was widely condemned
as an offensive charade by the media, featured

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.900
Trump handing out both large checks as well
as the aforementioned three briefcases full

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:23.900
of cash.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.460
Certain people were also invited to reach
into an aquarium full of money to grab as

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.480
much as they could hold after sharing sob
stories with the gathered press.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.790
Trump officially cut ties with the site less
than a year later.

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.880
Speaking of people flaunting their wealth,
boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr. has been known

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.000
to travel carrying suitcases and duffel bags
filled with sometimes millions of dollars

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.260
in cash, famously publicly stating, “When
I travel I don’t pack clothes.

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:50.660
I only pack Benjamins”.

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:55.190
Such extravagant displays of wealth are a
trademark of the boxer with Mayweather reportedly

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.900
having a standing arrangement with his bank
to have huge sums of money in cash periodically

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:04.920
delivered to his palatial home with the primary
purpose being to facilitate flaunting his

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.910
fabulous wealth.

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:11.360
Shifting focus slightly to the world of organised
crime and corruption, briefcases full of cash

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.220
are frequently alluded to in both firsthand
accounts from gangsters as well as official

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:17.230
police reports.

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:22.480
For example, a sting operation conducted by
Brazilian authorities in 2017 found that corrupt

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.440
politicians throughout the country were routinely
bribed by criminals with briefcases full of

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.440
money.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.220
Similar accusations have also been leveled
at Russian oligarchs who’ve been accused

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:36.841
of bribing officials with literal briefcases
full of cash in the past.

00:07:36.841 --> 00:07:40.500
Similarly, while scanning through autobiographical
accounts of underworld dealings from criminals,

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.360
we found multiple references to briefcases
full of cash being used to do everything from

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.050
paying off corrupt officials to settling debts
and fostering new criminal alliances.

00:07:51.050 --> 00:07:55.760
As for why the briefcase seems to be the go-to
method of transport for bundles of cash, the

00:07:55.760 --> 00:08:01.440
answer seems to be quite simply that a nondescript
briefcase, holdall or bag is a fairly innocuous

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.290
item that generally doesn’t arouse suspicion
when carried in public.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:10.210
Additionally, in specific regards to briefcases,
unlike backpacks and other kinds of bag, many

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.610
come with combination locks as a standard
feature.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.970
Couple this with the fact they’re lightweight,
solidly built, somewhat (or in some cases

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:19.860
completely) weather proof, and invariably
of a fairly uniform size, and a briefcase

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.150
seems like an obvious choice for moving large
amounts of cash.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:27.480
It’s also worth noting that some briefcases,
like those produced by Hollywood favorite

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:32.680
ZERO Halliburton (appearing in over 200 movies
and TV shows to date as the go-to way to store

00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:37.620
bundles of cash on camera) are specifically
designed to carry valuables and as a result

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.360
posses features like padding and a hardened
exterior, making them even more suited for

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:44.649
the task of carrying bundles of cash.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.620
So to conclude, the idea of people paying
for things with a briefcase full of money

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:53.630
isn’t just an invention of Hollywood and
is something that actually happens with surprising

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.640
regularity in the real world.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.029
Now, if you’ll excuse us we’re going to
go and research if any criminal has ever robbed

00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:20.730
a bank carrying away sacks with large dollar
signs printed on them.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:10:10.629
There 

00:10:10.629 --> 00:10:16.230
is actually at least one confirmed case from
history of a criminal committing a crime while

00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:18.420
holding a sack with a dollar sign on it.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:23.509
According to a police report obtained by The
Smoking Gun in April of 2015, a man called

00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:28.879
David Eli Lingafelter robbed a Subway restaurant
in Washington and upon being apprehended,

00:10:28.879 --> 00:10:33.779
was found to have stored all of his ill-gotten
gains inside of a small white bag he’d hastily

00:10:33.779 --> 00:10:43.899
drawn a dollar sign on the outside of.
