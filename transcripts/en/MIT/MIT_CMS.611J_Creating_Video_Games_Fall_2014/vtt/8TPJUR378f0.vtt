ANDREW GRANT: My
name's Andrew Grant.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.301
I'm the technical
director for the MIT Game

00:00:08.301 --> 00:00:10.310
Lab and sometime lecturer.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.607
I've been playing games
pretty much all my life.

00:00:12.607 --> 00:00:14.690
That's what my family does
when they get together.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.564
And then when computers
started doing it too,

00:00:16.564 --> 00:00:19.100
that's what I do with computers.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.957
I went to the games
industry in 1994

00:00:20.957 --> 00:00:22.540
working for Looking
Glass Technologies

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.190
and then I moved
out to California

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.799
to work for Dreamworks
Interactive.

00:00:25.799 --> 00:00:28.090
And actually, all told, that
didn't last terribly long.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.840
I burned out after
about five or six years

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.164
in the games industry.

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:32.830
And then I went to
be a solo programmer,

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.640
doing random contracts
and work-for-hire,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.380
kind of like a gunslinger
from the Wild West for awhile.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.020
But no matter what I do, I
keep getting dragged back

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.020
into the games industry.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.930
I like making games.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:42.888
It's what I want to do.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.470
Right now I'm playing
a lot of things

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.360
I'm playing a lot of the
cooperative LEGO games

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.270
with my son.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.290
He's four and we're playing
through LEGO Batman,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.940
that sort of thing.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:57.875
And we recently
started LEGO Lord

00:00:57.875 --> 00:01:00.520
of the Rings, which has been
a bit of a challenge for him.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.480
It's a much darker LEGO
game, oddly enough.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.630
And so he'll say things
like is Boromir a bad guy?

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.125
And I'm like, well, that's hard.

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:10.440
Let me explain to
you, you're four.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.520
He's confused.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.390
Is Gollum a bad guy?

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.300
No, he's definitely
a bad guy, yeah.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.861
But why is he going
with the hobbits?

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:18.360
Right, he's kind
of a good guy, too.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.550
I don't know.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.915
Anyway, it's a complicated
story for a four-year old.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:22.790
And it's kind of fun.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.970
I'm working on a number
things right now.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.110
I'm working on a side project
with the astronomy department

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.620
on some software for them.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.670
I'm working on an IOS port
of a game called Yomi.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.700
And I'm also working
on a fractal tangram

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.620
independent game.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.910
And with Rick, also,
at the lab, I'm

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.560
working on a massively
cooperative strategy game.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.230
This semester we're trying
a couple new game engines.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.021
We always try a couple
of new game engines.

00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:56.271
But I always like to let the
students sink their teeth

00:01:56.271 --> 00:01:58.437
into a couple of them and
then come back and tell us

00:01:58.437 --> 00:01:59.370
what they found out.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.420
There's a degree to which
I can do that myself,

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.700
but it really is
more useful, I think,

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.520
to get some people
with fresh eyes

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.970
to come in and try them out.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.400
Usually they come
back and tell us

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.070
the old standbys are the
ones they want to go with.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.020
We usually end up going
with Unity and Flixel

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.360
as our reliable ones.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.020
But this year we're trying out
a new language hacks, which also

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.292
has a Flixel implementation.

00:02:18.292 --> 00:02:19.750
And we're also
trying a game called

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.540
Phaser, which is used
by the Education Arcade.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.950
So we really want to
get our teeth into that

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.110
and see how we like it.

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:29.580
I've always been interested
in artificial intelligence.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.680
When I have a chance to sit
down and play with stuff,

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.596
I want to my computer
figure out how do things

00:02:33.596 --> 00:02:35.327
that it couldn't do before.

00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:36.160
That's a lot of fun.

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:41.380
We are in a really
interesting place,

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.945
I think, in games right now.

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:45.320
It used to be the case that
when I first started playing,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.737
that there would be two or
three interesting games a year.

00:02:47.737 --> 00:02:49.278
And you could play
them, and then you

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:51.590
waited very impatiently for
the next ones to come out.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.514
And now we're in a place
where you cannot play all

00:02:54.514 --> 00:02:55.430
the interesting games.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.080
In fact, I can't even play all
the really interesting games.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.490
There's just too many of them.

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.270
But in spite of that, I
still kind of want more.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.855
One of the neat
things about games

00:03:04.855 --> 00:03:06.680
is that there's a whole bunch
of different games you can make.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.600
I feel like, a lot of times,
we get stuck on a couple types.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.740
We don't necessarily need
another first-person shooter

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:15.497
that's super realistic
modern combat.

00:03:15.497 --> 00:03:16.830
There are some good games there.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.640
Don't get me wrong, but we
don't need five of them a year.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.098
But what I'm really
looking forward

00:03:21.098 --> 00:03:23.970
is seeing all the weird stuff,
the stuff that no one expects.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.699
The new, crazy things, and
the more games get made,

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:27.990
the more crazy stuff gets made.

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.250
And I love that stuff.
