00:00:00.206 --> 00:00:01.733
- [Voiceover] Hey grammarians.

00:00:01.733 --> 00:00:03.804
Some of you may have been raised like me,

00:00:03.804 --> 00:00:05.030
with the superstition

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:08.559
that it wasn't okay to start
a sentence with a conjunction.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.315
Like for, or and, or nor, or but.

00:00:11.315 --> 00:00:13.018
But I'm here to tell you,

00:00:13.018 --> 00:00:15.014
not to bury the lead, totally fine.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:16.629
Like, you may do this.

00:00:16.629 --> 00:00:20.169
There is nothing ungrammatical
about this construction.

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:22.445
Let me show you what I mean

00:00:22.445 --> 00:00:26.253
and what sort of sentences have
historically been regarded,

00:00:26.253 --> 00:00:29.109
by some people, as unacceptable.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.778
So let's start by looking at
this two sentence paragraph.

00:00:32.778 --> 00:00:35.750
"Ginny looked at the
painting suspiciously.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.419
But, as she turned away, she
didn't see it look at her."

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:42.159
Or, just starting something on its own,

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:44.666
without connecting it to, you know,

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.547
you can start a paragraph with it like,

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:50.007
"But the question remains, what is art?"

00:00:50.007 --> 00:00:52.399
There's this, there's this superstition

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.092
that says that you can't begin
sentences with conjunctions,

00:00:55.092 --> 00:00:57.391
that it's ungrammatical or weak writing,

00:00:57.391 --> 00:00:59.272
and I don't think either
of these things are true.

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:01.942
In fact, I think is a conflation,

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:05.727
or a confusion of a couple
separate issues in writing.

00:01:05.727 --> 00:01:08.513
But sometimes you wanna
punctuate a sentence

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:09.999
by beginning with a conjunction.

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:12.902
There's a kind of dramatic
tension you can access

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:14.179
by beginning a sentence like that,

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:16.617
kind of unexpectedly leaping into action.

00:01:16.617 --> 00:01:19.659
What I like about sentence
initial "But" here

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.117
is that it kind of, you
think the sentence is over,

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:24.033
and it is,

00:01:24.033 --> 00:01:26.323
but then this other thing happens,

00:01:26.323 --> 00:01:29.504
and putting it after a piece
of terminal punctuation

00:01:29.504 --> 00:01:32.918
like a period really serves to bring into

00:01:32.918 --> 00:01:36.089
sharp relief whatever it
is you're trying to say

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:37.608
after the "But."

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:40.232
I think this an awfully useful technique,

00:01:40.232 --> 00:01:41.439
and I'm not alone.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.318
Brian Garner, the author
of the usage manual

00:01:44.318 --> 00:01:45.549
that I use most of the time,

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.779
Garner's Modern American Usage,

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:50.402
says that about 9% of sentences

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:52.515
by, what he calls, first-rate writers

00:01:52.515 --> 00:01:55.394
begin with "and," "but"
and "so" or other words

00:01:55.394 --> 00:01:59.644
in the FANBOYS mnenomic,
if you remember FANBOYS.

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.402
And that's "for,"

00:02:01.402 --> 00:02:02.485
"and," "nor,"

00:02:03.358 --> 00:02:04.358
"but," "or,"

00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:06.691
"yet," "so."

00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:10.216
And then those are the
coordinating conjunctions.

00:02:10.216 --> 00:02:11.899
And it's not just Garner,

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:13.779
'cause that's a relatively
recent publication,

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.394
but we're talking about
language authorities

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:18.447
going back to like, Anglo-Saxon times?!

00:02:18.447 --> 00:02:19.422
I've never had a problem

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:22.957
with starting sentences with conjunctions.

00:02:22.957 --> 00:02:26.643
I think where the prohibition
has traditionally come from,

00:02:26.643 --> 00:02:29.685
where this language
superstition comes from,

00:02:29.685 --> 00:02:32.680
is a conflation with another problem.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.004
Let's get to that on the next screen.

00:02:35.004 --> 00:02:37.812
Alright, consider the following utterance.

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:39.391
"Because I said so."

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.691
Is this a sentence?

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:44.383
No, actually this is what's
called a sentence fragment.

00:02:44.383 --> 00:02:47.472
"Because I said so."
is a dependent clause,

00:02:47.472 --> 00:02:49.910
it can't stand on its own in a sentence.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.602
"Because" is what we'd call
a subordinating conjunction.

00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:56.481
So dependent clauses follow
subordinating conjunctions,

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:59.267
which means that they grant context,

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:01.729
but they can't stand on
their own as sentences.

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:04.283
If you remember the
analogy I used previously,

00:03:04.283 --> 00:03:09.066
an independent clause,
you know, is like a tree.

00:03:09.066 --> 00:03:12.572
And, a subordinating conjunction
marking a dependent clause

00:03:12.572 --> 00:03:14.825
is like a ladder leaning
up against that tree.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.706
You can have the tree without the ladder,

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:18.331
but without the tree to lean on,

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.048
the ladder's not gonna stand up.

00:03:21.048 --> 00:03:24.600
Now it's totally fine to begin
a sentence with "because,"

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.223
as long as it's attached
to an independent clause.

00:03:28.223 --> 00:03:29.717
So, you know, you could say,

00:03:29.717 --> 00:03:31.800
"Because I told them to,"

00:03:36.175 --> 00:03:37.526
comma,

00:03:37.526 --> 00:03:40.529
the goblins built me a sandcastle."

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:43.501
Very nice, so the little goblins do that.

00:03:43.501 --> 00:03:46.168
So, I think because of that fear

00:03:47.124 --> 00:03:50.607
of just ending the sentence
as "Because I told them to,"

00:03:50.607 --> 00:03:52.720
of creating the sentence fragment,

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.157
I think it's pretty easy
to simplify all that down

00:03:57.157 --> 00:03:59.523
into just saying, oh,
don't start sentences

00:03:59.523 --> 00:04:02.356
with conjunctions, just generally.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.000
So this is really less about
how you start an utterance,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.765
and more about how you end it.

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:10.111
If you're gonna start a sentence

00:04:10.111 --> 00:04:12.457
with a conjunction of any kind,

00:04:12.457 --> 00:04:13.487
you have to make sure

00:04:13.487 --> 00:04:15.986
that you're actually producing a sentence.

00:04:15.986 --> 00:04:17.379
So think about your follow through,

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.328
is ultimately the take away here.

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:23.045
If you start a sentence
with a conjunction,

00:04:23.045 --> 00:04:25.503
make sure you're building towards

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:28.177
some kind of independent clause.

00:04:28.177 --> 00:04:29.198
Now don't get me wrong,

00:04:29.198 --> 00:04:32.078
sentence fragments
definitely have their place,

00:04:32.078 --> 00:04:34.794
but, not in formal writing.

00:04:34.794 --> 00:04:37.186
You would use this maybe
for rhetorical effect,

00:04:37.186 --> 00:04:41.661
or, to approach a kind
of realism in dialogue,

00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:45.870
but not in essay writing,
not for the newspaper.

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.355
I just wanna repeat,
there's not really a rule

00:04:48.355 --> 00:04:51.884
against beginning sentences
with a conjunction.

00:04:51.884 --> 00:04:54.206
It's a superstition, frankly.

00:04:54.206 --> 00:04:57.155
And in practice, the rule
is generally ignored.

00:04:57.155 --> 00:04:59.872
So I read this paper
from like 1994, or so,

00:04:59.872 --> 00:05:02.249
that analyzed the frequency

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.400
of the word "but" in newspapers,

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.838
and found that 60% of the time

00:05:06.838 --> 00:05:09.601
it was used at the
beginnings of sentences.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:13.223
Which is way more often
than certainly I expected!

00:05:13.223 --> 00:05:14.616
But it makes sense for that medium.

00:05:14.616 --> 00:05:16.846
It's punchy, it's dramatic.

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:19.096
But, it gets a little stale

00:05:20.398 --> 00:05:22.953
if you use it too often, I think.

00:05:22.953 --> 00:05:25.274
But, again, you can absolutely begin

00:05:25.274 --> 00:05:27.039
sentences with conjunctions.

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:29.849
It's just that if you start a
sentence with a conjunction,

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:31.010
you have to follow through,

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.239
and actually make it a sentence.

00:05:33.239 --> 00:05:35.723
If you begin a sentence with
a subordinating conjunction,

00:05:35.723 --> 00:05:37.302
you're writing a dependent clause

00:05:37.302 --> 00:05:38.417
that needs to be followed up

00:05:38.417 --> 00:05:40.321
by an independent clause, right?

00:05:40.321 --> 00:05:42.202
So if you're beginning with
a subordinating clause,

00:05:42.202 --> 00:05:43.711
you're making the ladder

00:05:43.711 --> 00:05:47.104
and you need to follow it
up with a tree to lean on.

00:05:47.104 --> 00:05:49.470
But if you begin a sentence
with a coordinating conjunction,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.933
like one of the FANBOYS conjunctions,

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:52.372
you're in good shape.

00:05:52.372 --> 00:05:54.253
Just try not to overuse it,

00:05:54.253 --> 00:05:56.877
as you'd avoid overusing anything.

00:05:56.877 --> 00:05:58.827
Moderation in all things!

00:05:58.827 --> 00:06:00.081
So, take away?

00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:02.659
Write full sentences,

00:06:02.659 --> 00:06:04.888
and put your best "but" forward.

00:06:04.888 --> 00:06:06.420
You can learn anything.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:07.253
David out.
