First, we check if the clip is already loaded. And if it is, and we call the

00:00:04.043 --> 00:00:09.266
callback function with that clip sound. If it isn't, we create a new clip and

00:00:09.266 --> 00:00:14.604
we fire off an XMLHttpRequest to load that sound clip. Now, the response type

00:00:14.604 --> 00:00:18.498
from this request won't be plain text but it will be an array buffer, and

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:25.205
that's something we need to decode. Using the Decode Audio Data method. We'll

00:00:25.205 --> 00:00:30.006
store dat audio buffer into da clip. And den call our callback function once

00:00:30.006 --> 00:00:35.060
more. Finally, we'll send the request, and return da clip data at the very end.
