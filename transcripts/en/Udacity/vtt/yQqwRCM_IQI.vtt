00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.820
Okay, now we've learned about one gene. OCA2,

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.170
which influences eye color variation. But remember that

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.830
eye color is polygenic. There are other genes

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.110
involved. And it turns out there's another gene that

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.120
has a very interesting history for tying together

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.850
most blue-eyed people in the world. Most blue eyed

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.445
people have a common ancestor for about six

00:00:21.445 --> 00:00:25.270
to 10,000 years ago in the Black Sea region.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.550
It was in this region that a mutation in the middle of a another gene

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.505
HERC2 or H, E, R, C, 2. Arose within an individual and

00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:40.700
began spreading throughout the region. This HERC2 mutation regulated

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.600
OCA2 activity and impaired its ability to make

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.280
brown eyes. Now, the HERC2 and OCA2 genes are

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.664
located right next to each other on chromosome

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:56.830
15. So based on this information, which of the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.250
following could explain how the HERC2 allele modulates

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.610
the activity of OCA2? I want you to check

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.360
all the boxes that you think apply. Remember

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.250
to read each option carefully. If you have trouble

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.760
understanding this you should probably go back and

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.402
review some of the concepts in lessons 3, 4

00:01:15.402 --> 00:01:17.230
and 6 earlier in the course.
