00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
Everyone good morning it's Mark Wiens
with migrationology.com

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:08.460
This is Day Two in Taipei and we are heading to breakfast

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.740
Breakfast is included in our hotel, so we're going for breakfast now,

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.200
and today is going to be a sightseeing day in Taipei.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.720
Breakfast is located at
the other location of this hotel,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.420
which is just a block away and it's a
breakfast buffet and it's actually

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.759
pretty impressive over here I got a
plate of vegetables with some kind of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.780
pickles and then this is a plate there's
a little bit of noodles there and then I

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.340
think that's just stir fried onions in
tofu and then I got a bowl of dumplings

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.719
and vegetables

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.820
hmm Oh

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.859
lots of garlic and sesame oils we are
walking towards the longshan temple

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:01.149
which is one of the oldest and one of
the main landmarks in Taipei that's

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:05.950
where we're headed now okay
there's the sign up there to longshan

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.810
temple 700 meters

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:21.520
I can see the sign in the distance we
are approaching Guangzhou Street so

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.020
we're getting very close to the temple

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:32.680
we made it to longshan temple you can
see in the back of me back there the Sun

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.420
is blazing hot right now from what I
read it was built in 1738

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.570
originally by immigrants from the Fujian
province of China but now it has been

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.130
rebuilt a couple of times because it was
destroyed in various natural disasters

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.810
as well as in World War two but this
remains one of Taipei's most important

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.060
landmarks and buddhist temples

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.930
longshan temple was very amazing to
visit really busy today and full of

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.100
energy and now we're walking across the
street to the MRT station we're at the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.890
MRT station now and gonna look into
buying the EZ card which is a card so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.010
you can so we don't have to keep on
buying single journey tickets but we can

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.910
put money on that card and then be able
to take the metro easily I didn't see

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.750
this at first but it's a vending machine
to buy that easy card tickets is our

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:41.350
pleasure to serve you easy card purchase
ok successful the card cost 100 for

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:51.060
deposit and then we added 100 for ticket
fare this will be much more convenient

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.480
we are at the very front of the train
but it's so clean and so spacious the

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.590
MRT in Taipei is really nice we're
getting off the MRT at Chiang kai-shek's

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.370
nation

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.140
here's the map says for us to take exit
number five and then walk through the

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.850
park to the Memorial Hall

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.200
and one of the things that really
strikes me is just how massive it is so

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.760
in the photos you can't really judge how
big it is but in reality or when you're

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:45.079
here it's huge and there are from what I
read there are 88 steps to the first

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.090
platform of the Memorial Hall and I'm
going to go climb those now and see what

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.819
is up there this whole square is really
nice some really nice buildings and over

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.639
there behind me is the National Theatre

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.239
made it to the top of the staircase and
there is a great view behind me and

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:27.030
coming to the memorial now we just
happened to catch the tail end of that

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.860
ceremony but now we can walk in here and
see the memorial

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.400
the memorial is open from 9 a.m. to 6
p.m. and they have a changing of the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.400
guard ceremony every hour we're back on
the street now but before we left the

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.550
hotel in the morning I looked up a place
to eat Taiwanese

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.199
soup dumplings which is not too far away
so we are walking there now and I hope

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:58.699
we can find this restaurant for lunch

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.880
I think that is the sign I think that's
the restaurant we're gonna eat right

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.290
there with that red sign

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:22.939
downstairs is where they are making all
of the dumplings and doing all the

00:05:22.939 --> 00:05:26.119
cooking and then upstairs they have a
really nice dining room sitting in the

00:05:26.119 --> 00:05:35.199
AC right now feels really good and about
to order some food heated and Suzanne

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.409
thank you

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.090
pork dumplings okay Shalom bow the soup
dumplings have arrived and you got to

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.990
eat these immediately as they are hot
and fresh these are just little beauties

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.380
you can almost feel a little bit of
juice swimming around in these little

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:02.130
pockets of wrappers put it into my bowl
and you have to be careful biting into

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.250
these you do not want a one bite these
because all that soup will come

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.690
squirting out and can really burn your
tongue in your mouth so you want to be

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:12.980
careful be nice

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:17.680
five sizes

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.950
okay they're not that hot probably
because I took so long taking photos of

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:28.650
them but that flavor is wonderful the
rapper is kind of gummy and then the

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:32.640
pork inside is really soft and tender
for my next fight I'm going to reach

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.250
over and grab that chili oh that is a
pretty oily but good-looking chili sauce

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:42.270
put some of that on to there and then
but they put the rest on into the bowl

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.890
for the for the next dumpling

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:49.249
yeah

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.660
along with soup dumplings this
restaurant is also famous for their

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:00.370
fried chicken at least everybody seems
to be ordering it so let me taste this

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:07.919
that is quite quite a deep-fried miss
around the edges of the chicken

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.440
that's crazy crispy on the edges Paul
and then that chicken is not overcooked

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.479
on the inside it's really juicy as well
well that's good and it's not over salty

00:07:22.479 --> 00:07:24.629
either

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:33.110
now for the shrimp dumplings and you can
see they are a little different similar

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.010
shape but at the top they spread it out
instead of closing it and stuck a little

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:42.790
shrimp on the top but before I will dip
it quickly into this chilli sauce

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.990
and we also got a couple plates of
vegetables

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:58.289
oh that's very nice and crisp really
juicy and a little bit a little bit

00:07:58.289 --> 00:08:00.949
salty and sweet

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:07.090
oh because they're very very garlicky
that's good we just finished with lunch

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:11.380
those were some excellent soup dumplings
I wish I would have wouldn't have taken

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.860
so many photos so I would have been able
to eat them when they were hotter and

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.130
fresher because they would have been
even better but still they were really

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.780
good we got to the main street and you
can see just in front of me that is the

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.120
famous Taipei 101 building we're not
going to go there today but maybe

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:32.770
sometime in the next few days for sure
so stay tuned for that it's about 5:30

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:39.300
in the late afternoon we are heading
towards the Shilin night market

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:48.430
we just got off the metro and we're
going to take exit one for shillin night

00:08:48.430 --> 00:08:54.640
market just a quick travel tip I was
waiting until we could find a tourist

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:59.620
information center which is right there
right here at the exit of the Metro but

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:06.280
in Taiwan you can get a student kind of
a youth discount for many of the

00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:10.300
attractions as well as some
transportation all you have to do is to

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:17.230
qualify as B from the age of 15 to 30
and so I barely barely qualify just for

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:20.800
a couple of more months I'm 29 years old
you fill out this really short

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.820
application just your name and your
birthdate basically and then they give

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:30.100
you this little pass and if you are 15
to 30 years old when you come to Taipei

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.030
you can do the same

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:44.710
we got here right at dusk and already
there are lots of people here and we're

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:48.340
walking down one of the lanes they're
just shops mostly closed shops right now

00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:54.010
on both sides of the street and there we
passed a lot of food already and I know

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:57.550
there's going to be more food coming
soon but we're just going to leisurely

00:09:57.550 --> 00:10:00.690
walk around for a while

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:15.029
there are so many people here tonight
and just packed it's single file but I

00:10:15.029 --> 00:10:20.339
think this is a food lane at least it
looks like and so we're going to walk

00:10:20.339 --> 00:10:23.089
down this lane

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:28.300
okay we're going to stop at this stall
first for some fish balls

00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:34.499
we got the dark colored and they said it
is the spicy version

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.860
oh that is very spongy and I can date
some black pepper and a little bit of

00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.370
chilli deep we just came to the end of
the market and we found a shop that is

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:52.689
selling I'm not I'm not sure what
they're called I will find out and write

00:10:52.689 --> 00:10:57.999
it here but they are pieces of dough
which are filled with either meat or

00:10:57.999 --> 00:11:03.069
something sweet and then cooked wrapped
into like a calzone and then just like

00:11:03.069 --> 00:11:08.889
naan they are slapped on the edge of the
oven and cooked and all this is just

00:11:08.889 --> 00:11:14.470
warm and all beautiful and then topped
with just a ton of sesame seeds and I

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:17.579
got that pork version

00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.800
oh that's ridiculously good oh and
here's something funny

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:36.410
when I took a bite one of those sesame
seeds like blew out and flew into my

00:11:36.410 --> 00:11:42.650
nose that bread is really crispy and
then inside the meat is a little bit

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:50.290
sweet and I can taste onions and
I mean wow that's delicious

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:54.910
I'm gonna

00:11:58.579 --> 00:12:02.570
can you order me one young Oh

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:11.210
in demand gun okay I'm going to order
one of these tofu on skewers

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:18.370
all this yes please
thank you

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:27.640
spicy yes please I just ordered what I
think is kind of a tofu hot dog without

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:33.370
the hot dog so it's basically a two
strips of tofu which looked appeared to

00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:38.680
be deep-fried and then I think there is
some cabbage and I'm not sure what else

00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.580
inside of there and then stopped with
cilantro and she topped it with a little

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:47.910
bit of pepper or chili powder oh yeah oh
it's just one giant piece of tofu

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:55.860
wrapped into a u-shape and then drizzled
in dark sauce

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:11.910
oh that's very fluffy tofu and then the
outside has kind of a crunchy skin

00:13:11.910 --> 00:13:18.430
around it I think this might be a
surprise piece of stinky tofu because it

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:21.870
does have a little bit of a but it's not
very strong

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:26.490
I was thinking though I had some stinky
tofu and when I was in mainland China a

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:32.279
couple years ago and it was much like
had a more pronounced flavor and smell

00:13:32.279 --> 00:13:37.320
to it but this is not not very strong
maybe this is a mild stinky tofu but

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:39.920
it's very good

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.450
I'm still not sure if that was stinky
tofu or not but if it was I was totally

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:53.290
surprised I had no idea it was stinky
tofu and it was delicious

00:13:53.290 --> 00:14:00.430
I can taste a little bit of a like kind
of rotting sewage fish taste

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:05.770
but that tastes pretty good and I love
that tofu it was a really good texture

00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:12.370
really like spongy and kind of crumbly
it was a little bit sweet but that kind

00:14:12.370 --> 00:14:16.960
of compromised with it being a little
bit spicy and then that cilantro touch

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.040
on top that was awesome we are still
walking around Sheol in night market

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.010
this market is incredibly huge and there
are so many shops and so many food

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.080
stalls that it's mind-blowing

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.490
even though I've only been in Taipei now
for two days something I've been

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:44.110
noticing a lot on the streets is little
cubes of snake which are grilled and

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:47.320
then blow-torched
finally I could not resist ordering one

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:53.019
and so yeah they're little cubes of
snake he he blowtorch them a couple of

00:14:53.019 --> 00:14:57.910
different times and you could just see
the oils and fat just sizzling there

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:02.260
were a couple different ways you could
order it one which was just salt and one

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:08.500
was pepper but I got something called
singeing cumin which I have no idea how

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:14.350
you pronounce that but it's it's cumin
and I can oh I could just feel that

00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:17.970
juiciness in that skewer

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:27.470
all that is extremely juicy it is it's
not quite buttery so it doesn't fall

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:30.290
apart in your mouth but it has some
texture to it I can't really taste the

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:36.320
cumin on that and then it's perfectly
salted on that note of finishing that

00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:42.170
blowtorch steak we are heading back to
our hotel now it's been another long day

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:46.610
