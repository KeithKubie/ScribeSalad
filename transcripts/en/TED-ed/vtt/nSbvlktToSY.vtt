00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:09.166
You've found the hidden switches,

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:10.772
evaded the secret traps,

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:13.192
and now your expedition finally stands

00:00:13.192 --> 00:00:17.644
at the heart of the ancient temple
inside The Lost City.

00:00:17.644 --> 00:00:20.893
But as you study the inscriptions
in the near total darkness,

00:00:20.893 --> 00:00:23.648
two of the eight graduate students
accompanying you

00:00:23.648 --> 00:00:25.419
bump into the alter.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.055
Suddenly, two whisps of green smoke
burst forth

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:30.700
and the walls begin to shake.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.499
Fleeing for your lives,

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.236
you come to a room you passed before
with five hallways,

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:40.227
including the one to the altar
and the one leading back outside.

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:43.219
The giant sandglass in the center
is now flowing,

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.926
with less than an hour before it empties,

00:00:45.926 --> 00:00:50.436
and the rumbling tells you that you don't 
want to be around when that happens.

00:00:50.436 --> 00:00:52.493
From what you recall of your way here,

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:56.741
it would take about 20 minutes to reach
the exit at a fast pace.

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.382
You know this is the last junction
before the exit,

00:00:59.382 --> 00:01:02.439
but your trail markings have been erased,

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:04.427
and no one remembers the way.

00:01:04.427 --> 00:01:05.863
If nine of you split up,

00:01:05.863 --> 00:01:07.422
there should be just enough time

00:01:07.422 --> 00:01:13.158
for each group to explore one of the four
halls ahead and report back to this room,

00:01:13.158 --> 00:01:16.673
with everyone then making 
a run down the correct path.

00:01:16.673 --> 00:01:18.209
There's just one problem;

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:21.688
the inscriptions told 
of the altar's curse:

00:01:21.688 --> 00:01:25.612
the spirits of the city's King and Queen
possessing intruders

00:01:25.612 --> 00:01:28.481
and leading them to their doom
through deception.

00:01:28.481 --> 00:01:30.186
Remembering the green smoke,

00:01:30.186 --> 00:01:33.893
you realize two of the students
have been cursed.

00:01:33.893 --> 00:01:37.421
At any time, 
one or both of them might lie,

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:40.102
though they also might tell the truth.

00:01:40.102 --> 00:01:42.865
You know for sure that the curse
didn't get you,

00:01:42.865 --> 00:01:45.696
but you don't know which students
can't be trusted,

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:49.500
and because the possessed students
may lie only occasionally,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.350
there is no guaranteed way to test
them to determine which are cursed.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.447
Can you figure out a way to ensure
that you all escape?

00:01:57.447 --> 00:02:00.091
Don't worry about the possessed
students attacking

00:02:00.091 --> 00:02:02.181
or otherwise harming the others.

00:02:02.181 --> 00:02:05.812
This curse only affects
their communication.

00:02:05.812 --> 00:02:09.036
Pause the video now if you
want to figure it out by yourself!

00:02:09.036 --> 00:02:10.259
Answer in: 3

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.509
Answer in: 2

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:12.900
Answer in: 1

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.314
The first thing to realize is that since
you know you aren't possessed,

00:02:16.314 --> 00:02:19.122
you can explore one of the halls alone.

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:22.486
This leaves eight students 
for the remaining three paths.

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:26.217
Sending groups of four down just two
of the paths won't work

00:02:26.217 --> 00:02:29.734
because if one group came back split
two versus two,

00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:31.828
you'd have to guess who to trust.

00:02:31.828 --> 00:02:37.547
But splitting them into one pair
and two trios would work every time,

00:02:37.547 --> 00:02:38.995
and here's why.

00:02:38.995 --> 00:02:42.932
The possessed students might lie,
or they might not,

00:02:42.932 --> 00:02:45.183
but you know there are only two of them,

00:02:45.183 --> 00:02:48.632
while the other six will 
always tell the truth.

00:02:48.632 --> 00:02:50.759
When each group returns to the hall,

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:53.814
all of its members will either give
the same report

00:02:53.814 --> 00:02:56.606
or argue about 
whether they found the exit.

00:02:56.606 --> 00:02:58.995
If a trio returns in total agreement,

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:01.214
then you know none of them are lying.

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.331
With the pair, 
you can't be sure either way,

00:03:04.331 --> 00:03:08.944
but all you need is reliable evidence
about three of the four paths.

00:03:08.944 --> 00:03:12.382
The fourth you can figure out
using the process of elimination.

00:03:12.382 --> 00:03:17.245
Of course, none of this matters if you're
lucky enough to find the exit yourself,

00:03:17.245 --> 00:03:21.715
but otherwise, putting everything together
leaves you with three possibilities.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:24.150
If each group gives a consistent answer,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.028
either everyone is telling the truth,

00:03:26.028 --> 00:03:29.567
or the two possessed students 
are paired together.

00:03:29.567 --> 00:03:31.914
In either case, ignore the duo.

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:36.363
If there's only one group arguing,
both others must be telling the truth,

00:03:36.363 --> 00:03:37.971
and if there are two conflicts,

00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.673
then the possessed students
are in separate groups

00:03:40.673 --> 00:03:44.536
and you can safely trust the majority
in both trios

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.854
since at least two people in each
will be truthful.

00:03:47.854 --> 00:03:49.821
The temple collapses behind you

00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.780
as greenish vapors 
escape from two of the students.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.476
You're all safe and free from the curse.

00:03:55.476 --> 00:03:56.859
After that ordeal,

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.183
you tell your group 
they all deserve a vacation,

00:03:59.183 --> 00:04:02.432
and you just happen to have
another expedition coming up.
