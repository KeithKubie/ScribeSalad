  (beat music)

00:00:07.239 --> 00:00:08.441
  - Chop down.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:09.709
   You chop--

00:00:09.742 --> 00:00:10.810
 - [Woman] There's not
 enough booze for this.

00:00:10.843 --> 00:00:12.045
   - I've been rapping
   since the day I was born.

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.212
- Perk, please.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:14.147
 Perk.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.814
- [Perk] But I started rapping--

00:00:14.847 --> 00:00:16.016
 - Perk, right?

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.284
  - Pretty great, huh?

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:19.285
  I figured we'd just

00:00:19.318 --> 00:00:21.421
  throw a big sale on
  all our Asian stuff

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.722
on December 7th.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.123
 - [Woman] Wow, that's racist.

00:00:24.156 --> 00:00:25.591
  - I would never
  not serve an Asian.

00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.262
   - Please, wrap your
   hands around that corner.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.763
  - What's up?

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:32.432
- Yeah.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:44.477
(electric guitar music)

00:00:48.881 --> 00:00:50.349
- Fuck.

00:00:50.382 --> 00:00:51.384
(burps)

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.721
 ♪ I wanna know what love is ♪

00:00:55.754 --> 00:00:56.856
   (chuckles)

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.224
(loud laughter)

00:00:58.257 --> 00:00:59.392
   - [John] How was the game?

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:00.526
   - Oh, how was it?

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.695
   11 RBIs, 10 strike
   outs, 13 beers.

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:05.531
 That is a Delco Triple Bubble.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:06.732
- Wait a minute,

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:08.101
you know that troops
thing is tonight, right?

00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:08.768
- Yeah, oh yeah.

00:01:08.801 --> 00:01:09.802
  Here you go.

00:01:09.835 --> 00:01:11.337
I already took care of it, pal.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.773
 So, we got nothing left to do.

00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:15.041
 - What's this?

00:01:15.074 --> 00:01:16.375
 Heroes and Hoes Party.

00:01:16.408 --> 00:01:20.246
You've endured D-Day,
now enjoy Double D-Day?

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.814
Tell me this isn't real, right?

00:01:21.847 --> 00:01:23.382
- Oh, it is now.

00:01:23.415 --> 00:01:25.051
   That girl I've been
   seeing from anthropology,

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:26.686
 she's bringing all of her
 Coachella friends to hang out.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.155
 You know, the ones
 that already have HPV,

00:01:29.188 --> 00:01:30.523
  so they're not afraid of it.

00:01:30.556 --> 00:01:31.424
Courage.

00:01:31.457 --> 00:01:32.091
   - Courage?

00:01:32.124 --> 00:01:33.359
 - Triple hard

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:34.293
 - How many girls have
 you given courage to?

00:01:34.326 --> 00:01:36.562
  - Okay, that's fair.

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:37.263
   Well, guess what,

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.631
  when you've been setting up

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:39.565
   your little Chuck
   E. Cheese party,

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:40.566
  I've been making
  sure that this place

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.603
 is gonna be filled to
 the brim with hot ass.

00:01:43.636 --> 00:01:46.139
  The kind of hot ass that
  is gonna get these veterans

00:01:46.172 --> 00:01:47.607
rubbing rifles.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.808
 Not together, but separately.

00:01:48.841 --> 00:01:49.776
 They're gonna be
 rubbing their rifles.

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:50.777
 - They're not gonna
 be rubbing their rif--

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.113
 - I've had my rifle on
 safety for 20 years.

00:01:54.146 --> 00:01:55.314
(snorts)

00:01:55.347 --> 00:01:57.850
   - If you'll excuse me, I'm
   gonna take a power nap.

00:01:57.883 --> 00:01:59.318
   I just dropped an Ativan.

00:01:59.351 --> 00:02:00.686
 And you can wake me up

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.088
   when this place smells
   like gun powder and pussy.

00:02:02.121 --> 00:02:03.156
  - Wait, you took an Ativan?

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:04.390
  So your'e--

00:02:04.423 --> 00:02:06.759
- The thing is, cucumber
and Netflix is $15.45.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.461
   - And we lost him.

00:02:12.097 --> 00:02:16.636
 (party music)

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.041
   - I'm not saying getting
   shot with a paintball gun

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.409
   is the same thing.

00:02:24.643 --> 00:02:26.312
 But it stings.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:27.714
  - Hey, stud.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:31.551
(girls laughing)

00:02:31.584 --> 00:02:32.618
  - Hey buddy.

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.120
- Oh, hey dude.

00:02:34.153 --> 00:02:34.787
   - How's it going?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.354
  - It worked.

00:02:35.387 --> 00:02:36.522
   - Yeah, it worked.

00:02:36.555 --> 00:02:37.390
 Look at this.

00:02:37.423 --> 00:02:37.823
 Look at this.

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:38.791
   This one.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:39.592
   That's Stephanie.

00:02:39.625 --> 00:02:40.693
 - I don't give a shit.

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:41.260
  - She's a hot
  Pearl Harbor nurse.

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:42.361
  - Yeah, really cool.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:42.795
   - And this one, you know,

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:44.197
  is just hot.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.830
   And then--

00:02:44.863 --> 00:02:45.765
  - Hey, hot.

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:46.332
 - This one is like hot Rambo.

00:02:46.365 --> 00:02:47.300
  - Hey, how are you?

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.835
  - I think this one
  forgot to dress up.

00:02:49.868 --> 00:02:51.571
  - What? No.

00:02:51.604 --> 00:02:53.472
  Real nurses can be sexy too.

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.141
  (laughs and mumbles)

00:02:55.174 --> 00:02:56.742
   - We're playing
   salute and shoot.

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:57.810
 - Oh, troops.

00:02:57.843 --> 00:03:01.147
(exciting music)

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:04.750
 - Yes!

00:03:04.783 --> 00:03:07.753
  (slow motion laugh)

00:03:07.786 --> 00:03:08.688
 - Jesus, dude.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:09.622
 - What the fuck are you doing?

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:10.723
- I gotta watch both pant legs.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.058
  - My arm is asleep.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:12.525
   - Here, get it up.

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:13.192
   Get it up.

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:14.760
Come here, boy.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:16.128
  This works.

00:03:16.161 --> 00:03:17.496
- Dude.

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:19.131
It's not working, John.

00:03:19.164 --> 00:03:20.333
   It's not fucking working.

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.301
 - All right, stop it.

00:03:21.334 --> 00:03:22.268
   You're gonna scare
   these girls away

00:03:22.302 --> 00:03:23.469
   and I'm gonna fuck
   you up for that.

00:03:23.503 --> 00:03:26.072
 - The whole point of this
 party is to salute the troops.

00:03:26.105 --> 00:03:27.673
 That's the reason we're here.

00:03:27.706 --> 00:03:28.474
   - All right, all
   right, all right.

00:03:28.507 --> 00:03:29.475
 All right, all right.

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:30.243
   I'll fix it. I'll fix it.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:31.143
Hold on.

00:03:31.176 --> 00:03:31.777
 Are you a real nurse?

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.679
Shut up.

00:03:33.712 --> 00:03:35.448
   - I slept on it...I can't
salute.

00:03:37.816 --> 00:03:41.321
 (smooth guitar music)

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.590
- I got an idea.

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:45.825
 Izzy, are you thinking
 what I'm thinking?

00:03:45.858 --> 00:03:47.159
 - [Race Car Announcer]
 Downhill we go.

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:47.827
 Fastest part of the racetrack.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.794
  - Yeah, definitely.

00:03:48.827 --> 00:03:50.697
  - Oh my god.

00:03:51.597 --> 00:03:54.066
 - What is your email?

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:55.268
 This is gonna work, all right?

00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:56.102
 - Yeah, okay.

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:56.569
  - Trust me.

00:03:56.602 --> 00:03:57.703
 - I trust you.

00:03:57.736 --> 00:03:59.072
  - All right.

00:04:00.372 --> 00:04:01.540
 - How's it look, Izz?

00:04:01.573 --> 00:04:02.375
   - Perfect.

00:04:02.408 --> 00:04:04.010
  - Fuck yeah, Johnny.

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.112
   I knew it.

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:07.680
 - Thanks all, for coming out.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.548
I'm Russ Harvey.

00:04:09.581 --> 00:04:12.251
  You may know me
  from Potter Lumber.

00:04:12.284 --> 00:04:14.387
   A family business.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.122
   - You married in!

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.223
(groans)

00:04:17.256 --> 00:04:20.493
- It's amazing getting to honor

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.461
  these fine veterans.

00:04:22.494 --> 00:04:24.530
   You chopped down the enemy

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:27.300
  allowing us to chop
  down our prices

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:29.468
 on all lighting
 fixtures and windows.

00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:31.104
 Now through Thursday.

00:04:32.137 --> 00:04:33.205
(groans)

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:36.509
   I, along with my employees
   of Potter Lumber,

00:04:36.542 --> 00:04:39.111
would like to thank you veterans

00:04:39.144 --> 00:04:40.647
   for your support.

00:04:41.814 --> 00:04:44.083
 - I just wanna say
 that I do not support

00:04:44.116 --> 00:04:46.719
our imperialist foreign policy.

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.055
   - Here we go. Here we go.

00:04:49.088 --> 00:04:50.089
  Here we go.

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.293
 (trumpet plays "Taps")

00:04:54.326 --> 00:04:55.361
- Your arm is so heavy.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:56.329
 - Keep it up.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.263
 - I can't keep it up.

00:04:57.296 --> 00:04:58.765
I can't.

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.067
   (gasping)

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.001
  - What're you doing?

00:05:02.034 --> 00:05:03.436
- Hey, that guy's not saluting!

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:04.770
(booing)

00:05:04.803 --> 00:05:06.572
  - Salute the troops, sonny.

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:08.207
   - I'm trying to
   salute the troops.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.608
   - [Crowd Member] He's
   jerking off with the flag.

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:11.444
   (yelling)

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:13.045
  - Salute the heroes, Tommy.

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:14.113
- I'm trying to.

00:05:14.146 --> 00:05:15.581
   - Salute the troops, Tom.

00:05:15.614 --> 00:05:17.016
- John!

00:05:17.049 --> 00:05:18.017
 - Shut up, I'm trying
 to fuck that nurse.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.119
(booing)

00:05:20.152 --> 00:05:21.787
   - [Crowd Member]
   Stop jerking off!

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.556
 - I'm not jerking off.

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:25.391
   I'll salute with my left.

00:05:25.424 --> 00:05:28.060
   (gasping)

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:31.230
   - I'd rather you jerk your
   dick with your right hand

00:05:31.263 --> 00:05:33.065
  than salute with your left.

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.767
(booing)

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.502
  - You oughta be
  ashamed of yourself.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:37.370
 - I'm not jerking off.

00:05:37.403 --> 00:05:38.504
  I'm not jerking off.

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:40.039
 - I'm not jerking off!

00:05:40.072 --> 00:05:41.607
 - I'm not jerking off!

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.310
   (gasping)

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:50.583
- I certainly hope not.

00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.087
Sweetheart, why don't you go on?

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.789
- My grandfather is the bravest,

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:59.759
  strongest man I've ever met.

00:06:01.059 --> 00:06:02.995
  - It worked.

00:06:03.028 --> 00:06:04.263
 - What works?

00:06:04.296 --> 00:06:07.166
   (patriotic music)

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.467
Dude, sit down.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.566
(exciting music)
