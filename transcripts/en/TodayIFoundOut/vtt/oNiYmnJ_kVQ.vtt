00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:16.180
Women’s clothes come in a baffling range
of (often inconsistent) sizes which can make

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.400
finding clothes that fit just right an unreasonably
difficult task for many women.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.990
To help combat this, the clothing industry
has a number of tricks up its immaculately

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:32.029
tailored sleeves; in regards to jeans, one
of those tricks is Natasha Wagner’s butt.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.860
Born in 1981, Natasha Wagner took the modelling
world by storm about a decade and a half ago

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.950
when it was found that she had the “perfect
butt”.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.150
Since then, she has set the industry standard
for how women’s jeans should fit, working

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:51.180
with big names like Levis, 7 for All Mankind,
Old Navy, Gap, and Paige Denim, among many,

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.180
many others.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.210
Now the word “perfect”, especially in
regards to a woman’s posterior is an extremely

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.670
subjective thing and different people have
wildly differing ideas of what would make

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.620
someone’s backside “perfect”.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.390
But what does it mean for the fashion industry?

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.890
A perfect derrière is one that is neither
“too big, too small, too perky or too flat”.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.300
In other words, the perfect caboose is one
that is exceptionally average in every single

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.300
way.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:24.780
Natasha Wagner possesses and painstakingly
maintains such a set of average buns.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.760
Standing at 5 feet 8 inches tall, Wagner is
described as having ideally proportioned hip

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.100
to waist measurements, with her 28-inch waist
squarely in the middle of the standard jean

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.200
size range.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.650
Wagner was initially unaware of all this until
a friend’s modelling agency took her measurements

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.990
out of curiosity in 2001 when they noticed
her petite, but curvy frame.

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
The agency then passed the measurements on
to a denim company looking for a model of

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.320
roughly her build.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.049
That company subsequently hired Wagner to
model a pair of their jeans and found that

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.190
they fit her perfectly without any behind
the scenes meddling or camera trickery.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.060
Very quickly, other denim companies began
hiring Wagner to model their jeans and perhaps

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.659
more importantly, simply try them on to see
how they fit.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:16.379
You see, due to her ideal (by fashion industry
standards) measurements, any jeans that fit

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.950
her could be reliably expected to fit reasonably
well a range of other women, since, as mentioned,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.150
Wagner’s 28 inch waist falls right in the
middle of the standard jean-size range which

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.870
goes from 24 to 32 inches.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.980
Elaborating on this, fashion designer Julien
Jarmoune said that Wagner possesses, “The

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.099
perfect marriage of body types…

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.730
Because if you fit with someone who is too
curvy (tiny waist, big butt), or with someone

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:48.220
who has a straight body (no hips), you are
limiting yourself to just a certain body type.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.549
A jean that is fit on a straight body will
never look good on someone who has curves.

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:55.279
That’s why Natasha comes into play perfectly.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.769
She has the best of both worlds where she’s
slim and she still has shape.

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.379
Additionally, she has great legs that are
the perfect length (she fits our standard

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:09.319
30-inch leg inseam flawlessly) so that our
jeans will work for someone who is short or

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.319
tall.”

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.430
So by making a design that fits Wagner perfectly,
then scaling the size of the jeans that fit

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.739
her up or down, jean makers can essentially
make a single design for a pair of pants that

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.260
will be at least in the ballpark of fitting
women of most body types.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:30.379
As a result, since her initial foray into
the world of modelling, Wagner has been used

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:35.519
as a template of sorts for the fashion industry,
often being called in just to put on a new

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.450
pair of jeans to see if they fit.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.609
On top of this, due to her experience in the
industry that has consisted almost exclusively

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.819
of trying on jeans, Wagner is today also called
upon as a jean expert, being consulted by

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.469
various designers and manufacturers alike
to offer advice on improvements that could

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.219
be made to their products.

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:01.529
As Re/Done co-founder Sean Barron said, “She
has a complete understanding of what makes

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:02.790
a jean fit.”

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.559
Wagner herself stated,

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:09.079
Once I had learned the jean terminology, I
began to help designers flesh out details

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:11.370
or catch things that may have been overlooked.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.010
They’re busy, they’re working on the current
season plus a year ahead.

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.470
I’m just focusing on fit and am able to
point out specifics like if the back rise

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.859
is pulling or if there’s bubbling or roping.

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.639
A lot of the time you’ll get what’s called
‘slippage’ on a jean, where the denim

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.030
pulls and you can kind of see the weft in
the garment.

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.349
So I can recommend trying a different type
of construction or a different side seam.

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:37.720
I know how the body should look in the jean,
so I’m able to tell them things like, ‘Kick

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.659
out the back rise,’ or ‘Take a measurement
from the top of the rise and add it to the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:45.669
bottom of the rise to give it a nicer butt
shape and a lift.’

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:50.720
In order to maintain her self-described “median”
figure, Wagner subjects herself to a strict

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.870
diet and training regiment that consists of
squats (a drastically underrated exercise

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.030
for both men and women), running and time
on an elliptical machine.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.990
In regards to Wagner herself, she feels: “Very
flattered that anyone would say that I have

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.060
a perfect butt.”

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.860
Adding that when she was first informed of
her measurements that she felt as though she’d

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.000
“won the lottery” because they were exactly
the measurements the fashion industry was

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.490
looking for in someone to model jeans, allowing
her to enjoy a lucrative, if somewhat unusual

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:35.550
career in one of the most highly competitive
industries on Earth.
