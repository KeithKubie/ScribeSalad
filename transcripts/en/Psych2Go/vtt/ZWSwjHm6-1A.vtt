00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.880
How do you gracefully close an exceptionally bad date:

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.055
So imagine you've just finished this mediocre date

00:00:18.055 --> 00:00:21.775
You two went to dinner and you say 'I appreciate tonight, thank you!'

00:00:21.775 --> 00:00:24.955
Here's a hug, BUT you weren't feeling it.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:28.255
You know you'll probably not gonna go for a second date.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.085
You hug, but you keep your lips far away from each other.

00:00:31.085 --> 00:00:33.940
Clearly you are showing this person you don't want to kiss them,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.460
but, they still look like they are going to ask for one.

00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:40.080
Do you wait until they realize you didn't mention wanting to hang out again?

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.220
Or that you didn't even say when you'll text or call them?

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:45.275
It's actually pretty confusing.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.000
Regardless of if you are the dumpee or the dumper.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Everyone's different. Some people won't hug on the first date.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.680
Or some people's first dates are the whole nine yards.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.480
The current landscape of dating is filled with a bunch of landlines

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.940
and terrors.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.240
With the life at the end of the tunnel being a shiny healthy relationship.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.800
Getting in there is easy if you're with the right person.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.120
But how do you keep yourself from getting  ... through that cave with the wrong person?

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.940
The person who just took you on this bad date

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.820
Well, sometimes people are like puppies: you have to cuddle them.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.960
But still guide them with a firm grasp on the leash.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:19.920
If it's a good puppy that isn't eating your shoes or homework,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.580
give them a lot of prize and affection.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.040
But, if it's a bad puppy who's not listening to your wants and needs,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.720
and making fun of your waiter at the restaurant you two went to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.680
You shouldn't hesitate to tell them:

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.240
NO! NO!

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.960
If you had a bad time, say so.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.340
But don't accuse your date,

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.000
don't fake any interest or insult them or distroy their confidence when you look them down.

00:01:41.005 --> 00:01:43.715
They might be in a happiness balloon and a big cloud of joy.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.080
It needs a gently bring them back down to earth.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.580
Instead of sending emergeless lighting ball to crash them into earth in a big ball of fire.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.440
The great phrase to use is: I didn't feel good about tonight.

00:01:54.485 --> 00:01:57.465
This puts the emphasis on you and how you are feeling.

00:01:57.465 --> 00:02:00.505
Which your date will, hopefully, not take offense at.

00:02:00.505 --> 00:02:03.300
The more you drag someone along, the more pain you're gonna call

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.980
whenever he hits the fan, for both parties involved.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.320
If you don't decide to tell your date that in there,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.880
'hey, I rather not see you again',

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.640
find another way to tell them directly.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.120
Not responding and leaving them hanging in the hope that they might get the message

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.520
is a very bad idea.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.740
Whether you need to text them, call them or send them a Snapchat,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.880
make sure you're telling them: I don't want to keep this up.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:29.520
