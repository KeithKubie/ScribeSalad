00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:02.605
All right, why don't we walk through the solution?

00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:07.190
Here we've created the olympic_medal_counts_df data frame as we

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.420
did in the previous exercise.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.084
Now we're going to define this variable called bronze_at_least_one_gold.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.920
What we're doing here is we're picking out the bronze column of

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.941
the olympics_medal_counts_df data frame.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.170
Then we're picking out only the subset of that column.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.370
With the indices matching the indices where olympic_metal_counts_df's gold

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.830
column is greater than or equal to one.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.600
Then, we're using numpy.mean to take the average of

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.774
those values in assigning them to this variable, avg_bronze_at_least_one_gold.
