00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:05.671
 - Come on Lou.

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:06.806 align:start position:0%
   I just need to take an
   hour off to run an errand.

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.042
   - Nope, I need you
   on the lot today.

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:10.209
Even if it is a red day.

00:00:10.242 --> 00:00:11.210
  - A red day?

00:00:11.243 --> 00:00:12.745
- Yeah you know,
your lady thing.

00:00:12.778 --> 00:00:13.679
  - My period?

00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:15.081
 - Please don't say that word.

00:00:15.114 --> 00:00:16.682
- Why, it's just a word.

00:00:16.715 --> 00:00:17.617
 - It's gross.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:18.551
- What would you rather me day,

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.752
 shedding of my uterine lining?

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:21.187
 - I'd rather you say nothing.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.722 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Maybe, I don't know,
  sell some cars.

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.223
 - That is what we're here for.

00:00:24.256 --> 00:00:25.725
 - Shut up Carl

00:00:25.758 --> 00:00:28.061
 And Lou, come one, my ex is
 going to stop by the lot today

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:29.796
   to pick something up and I
   really rather not be here.

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.364 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Michelle, you
  don't get to choose

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.732
when you come and go from work.

00:00:32.765 --> 00:00:33.733 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Carl, I wish you
would have joined a cult

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:36.169
so you could only bother
people that deserve it.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.737
   - I tried.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.439
 - What have I always told you?

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.674
  - People are sheep when they
  come on the lot fleece them.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.342
- No, well yeah,

00:00:43.375 --> 00:00:45.411 align:start position:0%
 but I always say, "I don't
 care about your personal life"

00:00:45.444 --> 00:00:46.379
 right?

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:47.847
 - Come on, it's court ordered,

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.482
   and my ex knows it's due
   today and that I'm working

00:00:49.515 --> 00:00:51.484 align:start size:88% position:13%
 so he's coming by the
 lot to pick it up.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:53.119
  - What did you say
  about court ordered?

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:54.287 size:88% position:44%
   You get caught stretching

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.621 align:start size:88% position:13%
  in front of that
  middle school again?

00:00:55.654 --> 00:00:56.823
   - It was one time.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:00:57.657
  They thought I was
  a substitute teacher

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.691
trying to lure students.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.026
  - I mean, in their defense,

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.194 align:start size:88% position:13%
you do look like a
young substitute teacher

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.229
   that is just about
   to give up hope.

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:03.796 size:88% position:44%
   - Thanks.

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:04.697
   - You two shut up.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.265
  Dan stop eating on the lot.

00:01:06.298 --> 00:01:08.034 align:start size:88% position:13%
  Michelle, you can't
  go home today,

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
 and sell some fucking
 cars will you.

00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.141
 Jesus Christ!

00:01:16.442 --> 00:01:18.277
   Jack offs!

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.584
 (Carl hissing)

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:29.755
   - [Dan] So why you
   trying to leave?

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:31.457
- My ex-husband has to
come pick something up.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.525
  - You were married?

00:01:32.558 --> 00:01:33.659
- Yeah.

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:34.760
  - You have the emotional
  capability of a steel pipe.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.630 align:start position:0%
  - It was a passionate
  relationship and we eloped.

00:01:37.663 --> 00:01:38.764
  - Where like Vegas?

00:01:38.797 --> 00:01:39.532
 Reno?

00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:40.633 size:88% position:44%
   - No, Gold's Gym.

00:01:40.666 --> 00:01:41.534
 - Huh?

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:42.602
  - Yeah, we were both members

00:01:42.635 --> 00:01:43.536 align:start position:0%
   and one of the zumba
   instructors was ordained.

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:45.371 align:start size:88% position:13%
So one day after a work
out we got married.

00:01:45.404 --> 00:01:47.640
  - Yeah, that's why I
  don't go to the gym.

00:01:47.673 --> 00:01:49.075
 - That's why?

00:01:49.108 --> 00:01:49.809
   - Well one of the reasons.

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:51.577
 I also have wide feet.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.411
- Gross.

00:01:52.444 --> 00:01:53.613
- Like really wide feet.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.715 size:88% position:44%
   By Army standards I'm F4,

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:58.784
  unfit for military service.

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:00.620
 - You tried to join the Army?

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:01.654
  - Oh god no.

00:02:01.687 --> 00:02:03.256
I hate conflict.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.258 align:start position:0%
  I just like finding excuses
  to get out of stuff.

00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:07.026 size:88% position:44%
   - Anyway, we got married.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:08.694
 I quickly realized it
 was a huge mistake.

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:09.795
  I tried to get it annulled.

00:02:09.828 --> 00:02:10.729
  We couldn't.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:11.731
  We got divorced and
  now I'm a divorcee.

00:02:11.764 --> 00:02:13.733
I'm a divorcee.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:14.667
   - So what's he picking up?

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.068
   - Alimony.

00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:17.136
- You get paid alimony.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.404
That's the best.

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.106
 It's like investing in
 your sexual abilities

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.041
  to the point that if
  it doesn't work out

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.142
  you still get paid.

00:02:23.175 --> 00:02:25.044
- You are a human chain wallet.

00:02:25.077 --> 00:02:26.445
 He's not dropping off alimony,

00:02:26.478 --> 00:02:28.114
he's picking up alimony.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.182
 I was the breadwinner.

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:31.184
  I win, I always win.

00:02:31.217 --> 00:02:32.585
  I win bread.

00:02:32.618 --> 00:02:34.787
 - Wait, this guy gets alimony.

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.755
 He's awesome.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:36.756
 - No he's not.

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.557
  - Yes he is.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.291
 - No.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.192
 - Yes.
 - No.

00:02:39.225 --> 00:02:40.393 align:start size:75% position:25%
  - Yeah.
  - He's not.

00:02:40.426 --> 00:02:41.327
 He's terrible.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.128
He's the worse.

00:02:42.161 --> 00:02:43.062
  - No, he's awesome.

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:43.663
 - No.
 - Yes.

00:02:43.696 --> 00:02:45.064
- No, he's not.

00:02:45.097 --> 00:02:46.732 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.
 - No, no, no, no.

00:02:46.765 --> 00:02:47.633
   He's here.

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:48.568 size:88% position:44%
   He's right there.

00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:51.070
 You've got to give it to him.

00:02:51.103 --> 00:02:51.737
- What is this?

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.705
- It's a check.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:54.740
 Give him the check and
 just give it to him.

00:02:54.773 --> 00:02:57.043 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - I don't want to
 meet your ex-husband.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.747
  God damn it, she Batman me.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.482
  - Yo, what's up bro?

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:04.417
 - Hi, I'm Dan.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.318
Can I help you?

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.053 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, is Shelly around?

00:03:07.086 --> 00:03:09.555
   - Oh hi, you must
   be her ex-husband.

00:03:09.588 --> 00:03:10.723 size:88% position:44%
   - Yeah, love of her life.

00:03:10.756 --> 00:03:12.225
  She blew it.

00:03:12.258 --> 00:03:13.593
  - Yeah bro.

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:17.029 align:start position:0%
   She talks about you
   like, dude, all the time.

00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:18.130 size:88% position:44%
   - Really?
   - Yeah.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.298
- You know what though,

00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.233 align:start size:88% position:13%
  she's always worried
  about her career.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:21.801
 Never worried about my dream.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.469 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Oh yeah, what
  was your dream dog?

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:25.304 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - Protein shake
  that's also a vodka.

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:27.206
 Boom.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:28.241
  - But wait.

00:03:28.274 --> 00:03:30.743
It's protein with vodka?

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:33.179
- Yeah, no, it's
a protein shake.

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:34.313
- Yeah.

00:03:34.346 --> 00:03:35.781 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - That can also
  double up as vodka.

00:03:35.814 --> 00:03:37.316 size:88% position:44%
   So you drink your protein
   while you're in the club.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.252
It's vodka with protein.

00:03:39.285 --> 00:03:41.520 size:88% position:44%
   I call it Vodpro.

00:03:41.553 --> 00:03:42.688
- Yeah, that's sick dog.

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:43.723
 - Thanks bro.

00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:44.523
  - Sure dude.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:46.292
- What do you eat bread?

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.493
- Yeah, it's delicious.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.595 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - Dude, I haven't
 had bread since 1986.

00:03:49.628 --> 00:03:52.431 align:start size:88% position:13%
- That was like, wasn't
Reagan in office?

00:03:52.464 --> 00:03:53.332
 - Who?

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:54.500
Reagan?

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.735 size:88% position:44%
   Sounds like a hot
   chick I banged.

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:57.303
- I was talking about a
president that's dead.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:03:58.504
 - Feel my abs.

00:03:58.537 --> 00:03:59.305
  Feel my abs.

00:03:59.338 --> 00:04:00.373
Feel that shit.

00:04:00.406 --> 00:04:01.240 align:start size:75% position:25%
   - Wow.
   - Exactly.

00:04:01.273 --> 00:04:02.041 size:88% position:44%
   - Really?

00:04:02.074 --> 00:04:02.708
   - I have nine abs.

00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:04.110 size:88% position:44%
   - Dude, I get it.

00:04:04.143 --> 00:04:04.710
   - Yeah dude, slow
   down on the bread.

00:04:04.743 --> 00:04:06.012
- Yeah.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:06.746
  - Got to just go wild game.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:07.680 size:88% position:44%
   That's what I do.

00:04:07.713 --> 00:04:09.715
  Elk, bison.

00:04:09.748 --> 00:04:11.250
   - Those are buffalo right?

00:04:11.283 --> 00:04:12.685 align:start size:88% position:13%
  - I'll eat a fucking
  Native American.

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:13.653
  I don't give a shit.

00:04:13.686 --> 00:04:15.087
 - Yeah, well anyways,

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.622
   here's your alimony check.

00:04:16.655 --> 00:04:18.124
 You might want to check that.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:19.792
  Make sure it's all
  there, she's cheap.

00:04:19.825 --> 00:04:21.160
   - Yeah, you're telling me.

00:04:21.193 --> 00:04:22.528
   I was married to
   her for two years.

00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:24.130 align:start position:0%
   She never bought one
   canister of whey protein.

00:04:24.163 --> 00:04:25.531 align:start position:0%
   - Dude, I've been working
   with her for months,

00:04:25.564 --> 00:04:27.366
   she's never bought
   me cup of coffee.

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:30.236 size:88% position:44%
   - Fucking Shelly.

00:04:30.269 --> 00:04:31.604 size:88% position:44%
   - Fucking Shells.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.205 align:start size:75% position:25%
  - The worst.
  - Yeah.

00:04:33.238 --> 00:04:35.808
  Hey Lou, could I
  get a sales packet.

00:04:35.841 --> 00:04:37.343
- Why, who'd you sell a car to?

00:04:37.376 --> 00:04:41.080
- Oh, my new friend, Ty.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:42.682 size:88% position:44%
   - You sold a car
   to my ex-husband?

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:44.350
- Shouldn't have hung me
out to dry on the lot.

00:04:44.383 --> 00:04:45.084
 - How?

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:46.752
  He's broke.

00:04:46.785 --> 00:04:48.721
   You sneaky son of a bitch.

00:04:48.754 --> 00:04:49.822 align:start size:88% position:13%
You're like that trader
that convinced me

00:04:49.855 --> 00:04:51.390
to invest in subprime mortgages.

00:04:51.423 --> 00:04:52.391
   And yeah, I did
   the due diligence.

00:04:52.424 --> 00:04:53.592
  I knew it was risky.

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:54.726
   I knew the numbers
   didn't quite work,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.627 align:start position:0%
  but then I made a huge bonus
  for making a smart play.

00:04:55.661 --> 00:04:57.330
   Naturally I got a
   little bit greedy,

00:04:57.363 --> 00:04:58.431 align:start size:88% position:13%
  and all of a sudden
  I'm responsible

00:04:58.464 --> 00:04:59.398
for the collapse
of a hedge fund.

00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:00.399
   Can't even blame it on me.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:01.567
I was just a 23 year old

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.002 align:start size:88% position:13%
who loved power walking,
yelling at phones.

00:05:03.035 --> 00:05:04.437
   - Shut up.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.205
None of us care.

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:08.441
   And if you keep babbling
   I'm going to lose my sale,

00:05:08.474 --> 00:05:10.676 align:start position:0%
 because Ty's got the
 attention span of a mosquito.

00:05:10.709 --> 00:05:12.712 align:start position:0%
   - Yeah, but you can crack
   eggs on his obliques.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.547
- Both of yous,

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.717 size:88% position:44%
   get the fuck out.

00:05:19.752 --> 00:05:24.657
   (electronic music)

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.425 align:start size:88% position:13%
- So what's up, you
hooking up with Shelly?

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:28.060
  - Oh god no.

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.328
- Okay.

00:05:29.361 --> 00:05:32.361
 - I don't think anyone
 could make me softer.
