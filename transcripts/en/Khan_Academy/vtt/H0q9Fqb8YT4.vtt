00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's do some examples
dividing fractions.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:15.810
Let's say that I have negative
5/6 divided by positive 3/4.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.660
Well, we've already talked about
when you divide by something,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.520
it's the exact same thing as
multiplying by its reciprocal.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.540
So this is going to be the
exact same thing as negative 5/6

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.850
times the reciprocal
of 3/4, which is 4/3.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.850
I'm just swapping the
numerator and the denominator.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.460
So this is going to be 4/3.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.520
And we've already seen lots of
examples multiplying fractions.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.350
This is going to be the
numerators times each other.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.120
So we're going to multiply
negative 5 times 4.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.620
I'll give the
negative sign to the 5

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.730
there, so negative 5 times 4.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.730
Let me do 4 in
that yellow color.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.930
And then the denominator
is 6 times 3.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.460
Now, in the numerator here, you
see we have a negative number.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.670
You might already know
that 5 times 4 is 20,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.336
and you just have to
remember that we're

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:13.610
multiplying a negative
times a positive.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.930
We're essentially going to
have negative 5 four times.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.700
So negative 5 plus negative 5
plus negative 5 plus negative 5

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.500
is negative 20.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.400
So the numerator
here is negative 20.

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.840
And the denominator here is 18.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.450
So we get 20/18, but
we can simplify this.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.400
Both the numerator
and the denominator,

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.970
they're both divisible by 2.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.450
So let's divide them both by 2.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.155
Let me give myself
a little more space.

00:01:37.155 --> 00:01:39.990
So if we divide both the
numerator and the denominator

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.102
by 2, just to
simplify this-- and I

00:01:42.102 --> 00:01:43.560
picked 2 because
that's the largest

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.060
number that goes
into both of these.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.530
It's the greatest common
divisor of 20 and 18.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.120
20 divided by 2 is 10,
and 18 divided by 2 is 9.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.240
So negative 5/6 divided
by 3/4 is-- oh, I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.960
have to be very careful here.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.830
It's negative 10/9, just
how we always learned.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.325
If you have a negative
divided by a positive,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:07.350
if the signs are
different, then you're

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.270
going to get a negative value.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.320
Let's do another example.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.100
Let's say that I have negative
4 divided by negative 1/2.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.295
So using the exact
logic that we just said,

00:02:26.295 --> 00:02:27.920
we say, hey look,
dividing by something

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.040
is equivalent to multiplying
by its reciprocal.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.350
So this is going to be
equal to negative 4.

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.050
And instead of writing
it as negative 4,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.466
let me just write
it as a fraction

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:39.232
so that we are clear
what its numerator is

00:02:39.232 --> 00:02:40.960
and what its denominator is.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.900
So negative 4 is the exact
same thing as negative 4/1.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.130
And we're going to multiply
that times the reciprocal

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.040
of negative 1/2.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.630
The reciprocal of negative
1/2 is negative 2/1.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.420
You could view it
as negative 2/1,

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.740
or you could view it as
positive 2 over negative 1,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.600
or you could view
it as negative 2.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.880
Either way, these are
all the same value.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.990
And now we're ready to multiply.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.200
Notice, all I did here,
I rewrote the negative 4

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.540
just as negative 4/1.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.190
Negative 4 divided
by 1 is negative 4.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.220
And here, for the negative
1/2, since I'm multiplying now,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.150
I'm multiplying
by its reciprocal.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.710
I've swapped the denominator
and the numerator.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:24.440
Or I swapped the denominator
and the numerator.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.630
What was the denominator
is now the numerator.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.117
What was the numerator
is now the denominator.

00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.200
And I'm ready to multiply.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.991
This is going to be equal to--
I gave both the negative signs

00:03:32.991 --> 00:03:34.490
to the numerator
so it's going to be

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:41.130
negative 4 times negative
2 in the numerator.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.542
And then in the denominator,
it's going to be 1 times 1.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:45.500
Let me write that down.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.150
1 times 1.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.180
And so this gives us,
so we have a negative 4

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.300
times a negative 2.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.470
So it's a negative
times a negative,

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.400
so we're going to get
a positive value here.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.800
And 4 times 2 is 8.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.060
So this is a positive 8 over 1.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.274
And 8 divided by 1
is just equal to 8.
