00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:09.570
So the growth of the plant is what gives
rise to the Fibonacci pattern.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.940
So how does that work?

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.619
you think of this is very, very tiny
shoot just come up out of the ground

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.619
this is enormously magnified and it's
growing.

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.300
blobs appear those are called primordia.
Those are what are going to turn into

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.880
all the interesting bits and pieces of
the plant: the petals the seeds

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.100
everything and they pop into existence
one by one.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.250
there were none of them and then you see
one then another one then another one

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:50.340
then another one and they appear near
the middle and they move outwards to get

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.789
this sort of pattern. Looks a bit like a
pizza.

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.760
In fact Leonardo's nickname ought not to
be Fibonacci it ought to be Leonardo of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.210
Pizza.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:17.310
Suppose we slice across this growing
shoot.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.280
pattern the same spiral pattern.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.060
pattern work and there were two French
scientists Auguste and Louis Bravais.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.630
They were crystallographers.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.740
You measure angles and the Bravais brothers
discovered this whole pattern is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.490
governed by one special angle and again
I need a volunteer from the audience.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.909
Okay you want to come help me measure
the angles and see what's going on here.

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.040
Okay, here's your protractor. Got a
protractor to measure and let's just

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
move it around this way.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.409
primordia appear they start in the
middle and they move somewhere and the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.660
first one to appear ends up here. Second
ones over there a long way away.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
Third one's over here.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.030
Now what I want you to do is to measure
the angle between the first one

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.270
in the middle and the second one.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.989
We'll fit that in on the second one and
let's see what angle we get around here

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.150
Okay and what you make that?
- 140 degrees.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.160
Marcus. - Okay Marcus thanks now what about
the angle between number two and three?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.890
Can you just move it around and compare?
Just sort of turn it that way. That's it.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.130
And let's see how the angle between
number two and three compares

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.830
with the angle that we had. Okay we want to go to
the middle here and we want to put it there.

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.069
Oh look what do we notice it fits
again doesn't it so see 140 degrees

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.549
again and what about the angle between
three and four? You want to slide it

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:21.060
around and we'll check that one.

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:27.989
That's 140 degrees as well.

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.820
OK, now, don't go away. I need you for a lot more
yet what we discovered is this special

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.980
angle of about 140 degrees. You want to
hold that for a minute and perhaps come

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.560
around here. That's it.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.660
which two primordia you take, if you
take a primordium and the next one that

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.010
follows it and you look to where they go
and then you measure the angle,

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.260
you always get the same number and the
answer they got was 137.5 degrees

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.960
So your
hundred and forty is extremely close.

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.680
What we've got to do is find out the
significance of that special

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.140
137.5 degree angle.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.820
OK.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.780
What does that angle got to do with -

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.780
Fibonacci numbers and the sunflower
spirals?

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.760
What I've got here is a couple of pies
and look at this one we've cut the

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.000
circle into 8 equal pieces.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.950
Equal slices.
8 that's a Fibonacci number.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.970
And the previous Fibonacci number is 5 so what
I've got to do is take away five of

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.550
those eight. I'll get rid of those. Now,
Marcus, you're the custodian of the angle

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.130
can iu just compare it with that angle
there let's have a look yeah you wanna

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.890
lean over that's super. It's pretty close
and in fact if we use the breve brothers

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:06.940
angle which is about here it's even
closer okay so three eighths of

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.350
Fibonacci fraction of a circle is very
very close to one hundred and thirty

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:15.340
seven and a half degrees in fact that
135 degrees it's only two and a half

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.880
wrong what about this one okay now here
we've got 13 slices that's the next

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:29.620
Fibonacci number and I'm throwing away
eight so five are left 5 8 13 let's

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:37.240
compare that angle that's amazingly
close as well look at that it's almost

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:45.550
exact in fact this is 138 point four
degrees it's almost a degree bigger okay

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.229
so we've got an angle that's slightly
too small an angle that's slightly too

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:57.270
big both related to Fibonacci numbers
and 137 1/2 degree angle in the middle

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:03.880
and if you use bigger and bigger and bit
bigger Fibonacci numbers and form

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.340
fractions from them you get angles which
sandwich in on the angle the Bravo

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.979
brothers measured it's called the golden
angle very special and it's the one

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:22.950
defined by this process with Fibonacci
numbers now we haven't finished yet no

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.530
I'm gonna give you the wrong angle and
they're going to ask you to make us a

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:34.150
sunflower seed head using the wrong
angle and see what we get so you want to

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.740
come around here and
it what I want you to do we're going to

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.860
put in the primordia and to save time
instead of putting me in the middle and

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.210
moving them to the edge we'll just put
them at the edge where they end up and

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:48.510
suppose we used an angle of 135 degrees
to put them in

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.860
what pattern are we going to get okay so
you want to use that to measure and

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:58.590
let's see where the next one goes I
guess okay so over there it's going to

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:04.740
be there is it okay so I'll put that one
there now perhaps you want to pop them

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:11.400
in so the next one will be there great
and then the next one after that it's

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.280
going to be over there and then next one
after that all that century I'll do that

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.310
that's over there and the next one after
that here we go does that go it goes

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:35.580
there and then after that comes one over
there and now one over here okay and

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:44.160
then where would it go after that oh I'm
guessing that's it well it would go sort

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:49.080
of inside it there what you notice is
it's always going to be on one of these

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.900
lines because what are we doing we're
using three slices of the pie to measure

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.780
it so it always just moves round three
yeah and if we kept on doing this it's

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:10.500
gonna move around like this and like
that and like that and like that and I

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:14.460
won't bother putting any more in you're
beginning to see what will happen okay

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.990
Marcus thanks a lot that's great

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:30.470
so what we're getting here is a pattern
of eight spokes would that make a good

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:37.250
sunflower seed head no he wouldn't why
wouldn't it because it's got big gaps in

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:41.530
it it will fall to bits it will break
apart it wouldn't make this nice compact

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:48.950
circular seed head it's got a Fibonacci
number of spokes but their spokes now

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:58.280
the same sort of thing would happen if
we used this one with its 13 radial

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:07.580
lines if I were to use this angle to
make the seed head what I would get will

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:14.870
be 13 straight spokes so what we're
seeing here is there's an angle that's a

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:20.090
bit too small
there's the correct angle the golden

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:30.020
angle and there's an angle that's a
little bit too big neither of those make

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.520
good sunflower heads but they do make
patterns with Fibonacci numbers in them

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:40.760
but instead of spirals they're straight
so now what I'm going to do is show you

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:47.870
what happens if we start with this angle
small one eight spokes and move slowly

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:53.360
change that angle and keep building
different sunflower seed heads pass

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:56.270
through the golden angle in the middle
and see what happens when we get there

00:09:56.270 --> 00:10:05.180
and then move on a little bit to this
angle 5 thirteenth's of a circle where

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:10.690
we will get 13 spokes now to do that
we're going to put that on a computer

00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:15.500
and computers over here and if you just
bear with me for a moment I'll have to

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:23.360
adjust this so that we get just the
right angle for the camera to see it

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.180
that's about it okay
so what we see there is the 8 spokes

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.790
that comes from that slightly smaller
angle 135 degrees I'm going to change

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:39.020
that angle half a degree
time and I want you to watch what

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:45.680
happens so if we go 235 and a half what
we see now is still eight spokes but

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:50.570
they're curving they're starting to look
a bit like those spirals why they

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:56.149
curving because it misses by half a
degree every time and so it bends and if

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:04.160
we go up again another half a degree
they've been more at 136 degrees 136 and

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:12.970
a half it's still not making a good
sunflower head there are gaps in it 137

00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:23.350
still quite big gaps up comes the golden
angle 137 and a half and there we see

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.980
beautiful patterns and they all fit
together it looks exactly like the

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.930
sunflower spirals so that's the angle at
which it all pecks together perfectly

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:37.339
and because these things are very close
to Fibonacci fractions we see all these

00:11:37.339 --> 00:11:40.480
Fibonacci numbers

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:49.130
you
