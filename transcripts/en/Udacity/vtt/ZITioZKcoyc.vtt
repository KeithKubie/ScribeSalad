00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.870
Notice that Clifton didn't answer Katheline's questions directly, but

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.570
instead he asked a question in response. Well, this is

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:09.460
because the designer will not be there to answer

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.820
the questions in real life. The designer is not part

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.120
of the system image. Note also, that he talks

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.850
much less that Katheline. That is the best way for

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:20.842
him to learn something new. Now you try it. It

00:00:20.842 --> 00:00:25.770
could be anyone, your mailman, grandma, neighbor, honest friend anyone.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.488
Talk to a few. Let say three people

00:00:28.488 --> 00:00:31.860
and then revise your design based on the feedback.
