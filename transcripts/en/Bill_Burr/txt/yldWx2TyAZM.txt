Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's bill burn. It's time for the Monday morning podcast for my day. April 22nd, 2019 what's going on? How, ah, yeah, right now you're probably wondering what is with his tone. He sounds happy and I, and you know what you're like, oh, what did the Bruins when yesterday, what happened? I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:00:24       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:00:24       All right. Cause right now I'm watching live, I'm watching the Bruins Toronto with 1445 to go in the second period. Hey, come to pro and straighten up the right style. Sorry. Can't y'all? My daughter's taking a nap.

Speaker 1:          00:00:37       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:00:39       I don't know what happened with this game. It was just like Toronto came out like fucking gang busters and I was like, Whoa, this is finally there year. You know, they just a better God damn team. But you know what? The Bruins came back with a goal by Brad, my Shan. Oh No. Who's got the first one? Tory crew got the first one, then Marshawn got the one right off the face off after Burgee one version where I'm one one yet another face off. So right now it's two to one. Um, obviously the next goal is huge.

Speaker 1:          00:01:11       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:01:14       I feel like whoever scores next is going to win this fucking game. That's what I think. That's my big bold prediction. So I got the game on in the background.

Speaker 1:          00:01:24       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:01:25       This is like a fucking NBA game where it's like, it's a game of runs. Cause like all of a sudden now, now fucking Toronto can get the puck. I'll tell you know, I'll never understand this game of hockey, you know. Um, anyways, I want to thank everybody that came out to the F is for family, a um, panel that we did on a Saturday. Uh, it was really cool, man. I felt like the crowd was really, I had something happen after season three where I think we finally pushed through to not being underground as much, where people are finally actually watching the show. And uh, yeah, it felt really proud. It's sitting up there with Mike Price, Vince Vaughn and Peter Billingsley. Ah, the fucking Mount Rushmore of the show. Not Kidding. It said it takes a, it takes this city. But, uh, we had a bunch of voiceover actors showed up.

Speaker 2:          00:02:16       Uh, Trevor Deval was there, Phil Henry, Debbie dairy. Barry was there. Imagine there was a couple of others that of course I'm going to forget. Um, I think mo Collins was there and maybe Kevin, Michael Richardson. Um, any Ho um, it was a, it was a great time and people set a bunch of Nice things and what I was loving as much as it was saying, oh my God, the third season is your best season. I actually think season four is going to be even better. And I'm thinking sometime around season 11 or 12, I think we might, I think we might get nominated for something. What are you going to do? So anyway, I am sitting here on pins and needles hoping my Boston Bruins are going to push a, a force a game seven. And if they don't, I'm rooting for the leafs and I've come to this new, this new, a place as a sports fan.

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:03:13       Where I just realized all those years I spent hating teams and Hayden, great players and then they go when they retire. And I'm like, wait a minute and I'm going to miss this guy. This guy was great. Um, I know your root against them because they were on the other team. But, uh, I dunno, it feels a lot better if you lose to a team to be, hey, you know what? Good. Good for you. Good luck to Ya. You know, what the Fuck is Boston supposed to win? Everything every year. I mean, how long can this run last?

Speaker 2:          00:03:41       Um, no, I'm just, I'm gonna, I'm gonna go into that mode. This is all me getting read of my ridiculous fucking anger. I'll still have it. I'll still have it for my comedy act. God knows I went up last night and oh Jesus. I went up down the Improv here on Melrose and I went up at the laugh factory down in Long Beach and woo. Oh, stinker roof. The new jokes, just not just not working. I'm kind of coming out with this really fucking stupid one that I just ran by a bunch of jaded guys and they all told me it was funny. And then like, you know, women in like anybody who's like remotely happy as a man, they just all staring at me like, come on bill, don't you think you're a little bit better than that? Um, all right, well, um, you know, you saw that documentary free Solo.

Speaker 2:          00:04:34       That's what this podcast is like right now. Cause I don't have any advertising or any fucking emails because my stupid emails aren't loading. And then I went on the Internet and God bless this guy in a second language he was trying to tell me how to do is I go to guard your part of Jerky, bar their board and I couldn't understand what the fuck he was saying. And then he was on his phone and I slowed it down and in large the thing so I could see what the hell that guy was talking about. And uh, I dunno, every fucking 10, I Google shit every time I Google stuff, like whatever they're saying, it's like, okay, click on the apple, go to system preferences and then click on a fucking, uh, I don't know, software update or whatever they say and their shit. It's just Bam, Bam, Bam.

Speaker 2:          00:05:19       And mine is always like, Bam, Bam, go fuck yourself. It's like, I don't have that. I mean, I don't know what I need. I got to have like automatic updates because I feel like everybody's always like two v two episodes ahead of me. Whatever the hell it is you're supposed to say. Um, so I don't have any fucking emails. I asked Andrew to, to send them via text. He responded with sure. You know? Sure. It's a very funny word. You know, it's one of those words that's like positive and it's also very passive aggressive. Would you mind doing that? Sure. Or sheriff a lot of ways. A lot of ways to read that. Um, lovely knee is in the background. Haven't been on the podcast in a while. I know you're going to come on. Yeah, I want a little bit. Oh yeah. You get over it. You graceless get it out of there.

Speaker 4:          00:06:12       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:14       Yeah. Come the Bruins down the ice. A possible two, one, one and we fuck it up, Scott.

Speaker 4:          00:06:21       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:06:22       How the fuck did he score on that? Sorry. All of a sudden we slow down all my God. Can I just turn on the TV and listen to the fucking silence? What happened? I don't know, but he was anymore. I've got a kid. The whole thing fell apart. He just stopped. I think he just flat out beat him. Did he tip that in?

Speaker 4:          00:06:51       They made,

Speaker 2:          00:06:52       oh my God.

Speaker 2:          00:06:56       Krag softest hands in the NHL over at the brassy. Tip three to one absolute deafening silence up in Toronto. We win this game. It doesn't mean shit because you have to understand is a leaf fan okay? Provided you didn't win today. All right. You know dead. Even if you guys beat us, your team is going to torture you. It's not gonna be easy. It was like the other day when you had his fucking beat and then you let up that late goal. So you still had to be like, fuck, I'm all the Games are running together for me. I don't know. I just know you totally dominated us in our own building and game five. And I was just like, well, maybe this is finally the year. And, uh, the first 10 minutes of this game, I was just like, they just the better team. I feel like we're going six a, you know, five against six out there fucking Bruins. I love this team. I swear to God, I know the Celtics won four games in a row, which is fucking awesome. I got to get on that bandwagon. I just haven't, I just don't have the time. But um, I really, uh, I really am a hockey fan over basketball. Um, I just am Oh, Jesus. And I stick to the fucking taint. That'll be a penalty. Right?

Speaker 2:          00:08:16       It'll be a pet. Oh, Jesus. That's dangerous. Oh yeah. Hate to see that. Good. He got his knees out of the way. Um, anyway, plowing ahead here. Uh, so I'm getting ready to leave to go over to Iceland middle part of this week and uh, Amy, I want to talk to you about my packing. Huh? She's already given me shit.

Speaker 1:          00:13:51       I'm asking you,

Speaker 2:          00:13:54       I love this commercial with this guys in like a racing suit, like a fire retardant suit and he's sitting there going, I love my job. And he's all excited because he's driving a fucking Honda civic. Rarely does that get your fucking balls in an uproar there guys dressed like a race car driver and he's excited to drive a fucking sophomore in college chick car if you've got money. Right. Okay. Then after, after Israel, the next show I have is, uh, the Wilbur Theater in Boston, Massachusetts for the, uh, Travis. Roy Foundation. And then after that I'm doing September 6th, the Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas. And I have to tell you people, uh, over the summer, I will be, uh, putting my act together in local comedy clubs and I'll try to be giving you the heads up as I do that, uh, over the summer here in loss on golf a visa. Um, all right. Hey, let's read, let's read something that I actually just found it an email that I could actually read.

Speaker 1:          00:14:55       Um, oh, that ain't it.

Speaker 2:          00:14:57       That's notes for season five. If we get it, that's how far ahead I am. Notes on season five for F is for family. This guy from Australia sent me an email

Speaker 1:          00:15:09       and, um, let's see what we got here. Oh, and I somehow fucking deleted. So fucking annoying, man. There it is.

Speaker 2:          00:15:22       This fucking guy sent me something. He said, good day, Billy. Red Nuts. Love your podcast mate. Uh, you crack me up. I'm also an older gentleman who has a small child close to your daughter's age, so I love to hear how she's developing as my lad is doing the same things. It's great. I hope this is where you get your emails for the podcast. Any who probably hasn't made news over your way. But here in Australia there's been considerable problems with militant vegans invading private farms. They're really pissing people off. What has happened to the left? Maddie's fit going fucking crazy. I kinda like it,

Speaker 1:          00:16:01       you know? Um, yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:16:05       so they got militant vegans, Jesus Christ. How much is Australia changed? You know, they used to have a crazy guy wrassling alligators down there and now all of a sudden they got people fucking going nuts about kumquats. Um, anyways, it really pissing people off. A friend came to me the other day and said, how do you know if someone's a Vegan? I said, I don't know. He said, don't worry. They'll fucking tell you. Ha it cracked me up. Keep it up, mate. You should head down to Adelaide, South Australia sometime. Get stuffed your mug. The fuck does get stuffed. Me can only imagine that some sort of fucking take a dick in your ass.

Speaker 1:          00:16:49       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:16:51       I've got to tell you right now, I'm watching this fucking game and what the fucking Bruins are doing right now. If these maple leafs of Toronto don't wake up this fucking game, it's, it's over with six minutes left in the second period. I said it before, the next goal is going to win. Although the way hockey is, I'll say the next goal, we go up four to one. I will be feeling good, but if Austin Matthews gets another one, he had caught fucking great is that guy, they already showed them the beginning of the game. They showed them skating slow motion. Like when they had the maple leafs in uh, emblem on the ice and he that, that 34 Jersey is already Iraq. Uh, ironic, iconic. I'm looking at that thing like this guy is, he's going to be a hall of Famer. I mean, that's not too hard to guess. You know, considering we scored four goals in his first fucking game.

Speaker 1:          00:17:43       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:17:45       Bruins. Just down the maple leafs and the entire second period, at least the point that I've been looking at. All right? So militant vegans, Nia, militant vegans are going fucking nuts over there in Australia. I guess they're marching onto farms. Here's the thing about militant vegans. All right? You might think they're assholes, but I gotta be honest with you there, right? The way we treat animals, a, I'm all for killing them and eating them, but this shit, like you ever see what they do to chickens and stuff? They shoot steroids into their fucking chicken breasts and they can't even walk. They're tipping over. They clip off the front of their beaks. The shit that we do to animals, um, is fucking horrible. And I gotta be honest with you, this whole fucking thing is we do it, you know, so human beings don't suffer. Uh, you know, I, I don't know about that.

Speaker 2:          00:18:37       I think at this point they're just doing it for money. I think enough animals have suffered. So I actually agree with these militant vegans as far as like how they, they view what we do to animals, but I stopped short of just marching on to somebody's property and scaring the shit out of families and stuff. I about, um, the problem though is when you do shit like that is everybody just says you're an asshole. But no one was listening to them before. So what are they supposed to do? I'm calling this right now. Militant vegans are going to invade

Speaker 5:          00:19:16       mmm

Speaker 2:          00:19:17       oh farm and their love of animals will make them approach an animal they should not approach. And somebody's gonna get hurt on the beacon side. That's, that's my prediction. Nia. What do you say about that? Yeah, that's it. Can you Cheney just come, I don't have any fucking emails. I don't have any advertising. Can you fucking pick up a microphone and helped me out for a couple of minutes? Jesus quite, you know what's funny about you? The level that you stress when we go to the airport, I'm just packing. I'm getting myself together. Okay. Let's try to be prepared. Okay. Is this going to be the energy? Are you going to come in and have a little fun in the middle of my thing? So I was kind of focused on that, but uh, unpack, I'm bringing a backpack and a in a little carry on. Okay. For this trip and I'm just letting you know, I'm packing one shirt and one pair of pants from my entire tour and then I'll have a, I'll have a fucking, is this guy a bookie track suit and for my flights and then I'll just have some walking around town close and then a bunch of underwear and socks.

Speaker 2:          00:20:25       That's how I'm doing. That's not doing it. Okay for you. Where are your comedy instincts? Just what you're supposed to go against it like you did last night. We were like, we're going to be going out to dinner. I was, I was getting there, but you just jumped in. I had a chance to, I was going to say, okay, well what about, and then I was going to get into it. All right, Andrew, edit all of this out. All right, well, Gee, I don't know. Don't edit this shit. I don't give a fuck what no is, it really isn't really gonna bother you if I went to same shirt every night. Yeah. Like you know, I think we're going to be going out to dinner, this and that. You're not gonna switch it up at all. You know what it is, and yet when you're going country to country, country, which I will be doing after we have a little few days there in Iceland.

Speaker 6:          00:21:15       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:21:16       it's like your stuff just becomes a burden. Yeah, no, I got it. So you just want to like, you know Jim Morrison where the same fucking brown leather pants his entire tour. Look at that guy. Everybody still loves him. He's not dead because of his pants. Are you comparing yourself to Jim Morrison? My traveling? Yes. Jesus. The way I travel. Wow. If it was good enough for Jim Morrison is good enough for me. Right, right. Well, I talked to Steven Adler and I said, dude, you going on a one world tour? What are you doing? He goes, easy. He goes, one pair of pants, two shirts. Yeah, sounds disgusting. Well, you're going to hit somebody who's going to give you a shirt while you're out there if you're a rock star, right? So you're just trusting. So that's what you're going for us. And I'll look if you're a regular guy like me, when you audience list Copenhagen.

Speaker 2:          00:22:04       Oh, this is how, that's what you're waiting for. No, this is how it works is pretty stylish. So maybe they can help you out. I don't know. First of all, any European gives me a shirt is not going to fit because they were like child sizes over there. Yeah. Um, there, there's this slim Whitman over there. Now here's the deal. As far as a rock star, you're going to bang a chicken. Then they're going to give you stuff. That's how it works. When you're a rock star, if you just a regular guy like me, if you bag somebody, you lose a shirt. That's how it worked when I was a single man. Okay. I'm not saying now, I'm not saying I'm going to go this Shlomo arena they and try to, I wish I was going to Tel Aviv. I bet you do. Well, I'm going to go there. I'll get the lay of the land. I'll go to the weep and wall. Was that what they call it? I don't know. The crying, weeping Lawson's right. Is that right?

Speaker 6:          00:22:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:22:53       I dunno. I don't, I don't, I, I'm not into any of that stuff so I'm going to like respectfully stay away from those things. I'm going to go over there and see if they go to Mcdonald's. I'm perfect. Get myself a quarter pounder with cheese. No, I'm actually really looking good forward to it because uh, you know, historically speaking Jewish people as some of the funniest people on the planet. You know, if you go through showbusiness, you remember that Adam Sandler Song there, Huh? Yeah. All three stooges. [inaudible] the Hanukkah Song. I know that song. Yeah. What do, what do you mean? I'm just saying he named all these fuckers funny people. He was naming all these people who are Jewish. Yeah. Yeah. That was fun. I don't know why this is so hard. Nia. What happened to our chemistry and I know.

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       All right. At the height of you loving me, scale of one to 10 was it at, what do you mean? At the height of me? Lemme Yeah. What is that supposed to mean? Why? I know you never got to 10 dip down. Yeah, no. Where are you at currently? Okay. I know you still love me, but as far where's the, like the, the like is what shifts in a marriage. Oh, that's true.

Speaker 2:          00:26:19       The drums are awesome. I don't even know what that's about. Just sounds funny. Oh, well he's not kidding around. Now this is a very, uh, I believe why people would say militant rather than he's a, a African American man expressing his displeasure with white people. We say he's militant, which sounds borderline military, which white people do support unless it's a black only sort of movement as far as I could tell. Minute 22 to go in the second period. And yet you're Boston Bruins are up three games to one. Oh my God. He missed Jesus Christ. Nice thing. Maple leaves. That is the Toronto may police.

I would always bring up the fact that if they lose, I'm going to have to sell my house and go home and tell my children that we're moving away from their friends. All right. Or You fucking assholes could go out here and score some goddamn goals for me. Neo, do you think about militant vegans in Australia? Sounds pretty scary. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:42:09       By the way, congratulations to the second batch of stand up comics that went up on our premium blend style show for comedy central. Uh, my good buddy Josh Adam Meyers closed out the second one and absolutely murdered. Um, so many people had fucking monster is sets during this, uh, during the taping and they made all things comedy look really good and a comedy central was psyched and uh, hopefully we'll get to do it some more. And I loved the whole process, getting to meet all these young comics up and come and getting to know who's the funny people and whatnot. And uh, I dunno. Uh, it was, it was, I think they, we got a home run there. So anyways, let's get to some of the emails here for the week and then we'll watch the Bruins game together. We, although I imagine a bunch of people in Toronto will be fucking turning this off if it stays the same or if they have a miraculous comeback. Here's the deal. Uh, I'm going to do it until fucking the end of regulation. I'm not gonna fucking, I'm not going to keep going and you know, one of these fucking triple overtime games. Um, all right. Okay. Emails, Kate Smith, dear Billy booboo bird, check out this video about the God bless America controversy. Classic case of generations not understanding each other. Love you and love the podcasts. All right, let's check this out. God bless America. Hey, why is it when you know, every time? Um,

Speaker 9:          00:43:46       all right, morning yesterday that the game he's quit claims Ms Rendition of God bless America during the seventh inning stretch after the club was made aware of Smith's potential racism this morning, newspapers in Philadelphia report it fliers or cutting ties with Smith to know when a statue honoring her with a blanket. Smith, a popular singer, the 1940s.

Speaker 2:          00:44:12       Do you know what's hilarious? I got to tie them out. That thing that they covered, the thing that they just covered Kate Smith statue up with made her look like she was the next level. She looks, it looks like she's wearing a Klan Hood, except it's all black like this, you know, the grand wizard clan guys,

Speaker 7:          00:44:32       you know, I think he has a couple extra patches. It's Kinda like this cub scouts except with a lot more hatred. Um,

Speaker 9:          00:44:40       are you kidding me? Ties with Smith to covering a statue. Honoring her with a blanket. What is the evidence opera singer in the 1940s has been dead since 1986 she rose to fame in 1938 when Jewish composer, composer, urban Berlin Railroad, God bless America, specifically for Smith and as a peace time protest of Adolf Hitler because of Smith's rendition. God bless America became this country's second national anthem.

Speaker 7:          00:45:12       Wait a fucking minute. What is this shit? This new evidence. Katie Smith racist evidence. I mean, what did she send a text message? Somebody just bomb. Okay. Wait a second. Wasn't everybody racist back then? Cause even if you are liberal, what you thought was nowhere near where the fuck we are now. This is so dumb. This is really bad, man. You can't fucking go back when somebody's not alive to defend themselves. All right. How come nobody back then said she was racist? Is that because everyone was racist back then? And if they were, wasn't she just evict them of her time with the information that was available?

Speaker 7:          00:46:06       I mean there was time people walked around, they thought slavery you. Yet. It makes sense to me cause that's what people did it. That's you know, there's a lot of shit we're doing right now. Do you think you're going to fucking get to 80 and look back on shit you didn't your 20s, you're like, oh my God, I can't believe we used to do shit or said that are eight data thought this all right. Who says one fan can't make a difference? It was one fan who contacted the Yankees about cage Smith's racist singing background that caused them to remove the God bless America from the seventh inning stretch which cause Stefan Bondy of the New York Daily News to write about it, which also caused the Philadelphia flyers to not only remove her song but cover up the statue outside the extent, uh, expanded he live as well. I spoke with Bondi before his insight edition experience it appearance. He said, I obviously didn't expect the reaction that it got. Well what did you think was gonna Happen? Says Bondi, but I think it's a sign of the times in a good sign that the flyers also reacted the way they did.

Speaker 7:          00:47:13       Meanwhile, the Redskins are still called the Redskins. None of this shit makes sense. So as Katie Smith really a racist or struggling artists trying to get work, nobody knows, and I think that's still part of the investigation. Bondi said, well then what the fuck?

Speaker 7:          00:47:30       How are you going to investigate that after she's dead and everybody else who was part of the class was dead. How are you going to investigate this? You just slandered somebody fucking name. Speaking of slander, there's not been much as to who Kate Smith is as a person. There hasn't been any stories to suggest that she did anything racially insensitive in her private life. But there are these songs. Bonnie said she was born in the south, raised during the time of Jim Crow laws, yet this isn't her fault. It was a racist time. They were. These were different times and some of the things she said would have been racist back then. You still get to pick what, wait a second, and some of the things she said would have been racist back then. You still get to pick some of the songs you sing. This is these fucking people. Who is this Brody person and let me, can we investigate your life through this level? You never said anything. You didn't do anything. You didn't laugh at somebody. Can We destroy your fucking life now, but a fucking sack over your head?

Speaker 7:          00:48:38       What about the fact that these songs were recorded so long ago when the times were so different? Obviously says, I look at it talking to his Bondi person, like this person, some sort of expert. I'm sure it was interpreted differently in 1939 but it's not 1939 yeah, but it was when she did it this shit back then. Dude. That's like when they come up with a new law. You can't prosecute somebody for doing something yesterday that today is now illegal, but it's not 1939 and that song is being played to all sorts of people of race and color and creed at Yankee Stadium in 2019 yet, God bless American at the racist song.

Speaker 7:          00:49:21       I don't get this. I don't get this at all. I don't get, I don't get this. Then they try to get the flyers in trouble. You can also add the flyers to that list is people not playing the song, but one has to wonder what would they have done if it, if it were game seven of the Stanley Cup finals and they played this song before the last three wins. This is all this is. This whole fucking error is just trying to get people in trouble. I think when you do something like that to somebody, they should immediately, they should immediately investigate your life. If you're going to take somebody down, we're not gonna investigate your life to see if we need to take you down too. And you know what? Watch everybody shut the fuck up because we're all guilty of something myself included. Give me a fucking break. We've all done shit. We've all said Shit. We, I mean part of life is growing as a person. I bet if you asked her at the end of her life, what do you think about those songs? I bet she did have a different opinion than when the fuck she sung.

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       It didn't even say how old she was when she sang the song. It's so fucking stupid. I think that's ridiculous. I think it's ridiculous. And it's this fucking thing that white people who live now do, and they try to act like they're trying to be brave and sensitive and what they're really doing is they're using somebody else to fucking show how awesome they are as something it's I big. It's all self serving. I don't know. And I'm also assuming this person's white check probably shouldn't, but I dunno. I just know all of my black friends, when I brought that country, it's about John, John Wayne. They all just laughed. Like, who gives a fuck about a dead white guy? We're dealing with the white people that are still alive. All right. Ukraine president. Uh, dear bill, President Day Oh oh oh to virus point blank. 58 58. So up by two Corollas. Dear Bill, President Date A, theirs is hope for the world. Oh, thank God. Hey guys, how about some more positive shit too? By the way, a company, a comedic personality from the Ukraine, just beat the incumbent in a landslide to become president. What is that a good thing?

Speaker 3:          00:51:43       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       I don't think I want a fucking clown run in my country. Uh, when are you running and what's your slogan going to be? A what will you do about the Middle East? Who will be your vice? All right, I'll answer these questions. Uh, is what I do about the Middle East.

Speaker 2:          00:52:04       Toronto just scored. Oh, and now ladies and gentlemen, we have a fucking game here. Was that Austin Matthews again? He's fucking awesome. Oh my God. They keep getting us with that fucking, let me watch this replay. Oh my God. He came eat. Oh. Tuco went from right to left and then he shot it over his right shoulder like the fucking sniper that he is top shelf. And look at the look on his face. Look at him. Jesus Christ. All right bro. Oh fuck me. Fuck me. I was relaxed and now I am not. Toronto wins the face off in the Bruin zone. All right. Just relax. Don't be a bunch of punk. Jason. Jackasses and just fuck, fuck. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh they got the puck. Oh Jesus. They go day to day.

Speaker 3:          00:53:13       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:53:13       All right. I can't watch this shit. Here you go. Take the fucking body something. Anyways, um,

Speaker 7:          00:53:24       hey man, what the fuck was talking about? Oh, how I would solve the Middle East. All right. First of all, I would convert this country to solar power.

Speaker 2:          00:53:33       I would enact that guy from Tesla's plans for that solar shit on the roads. And then is is, is I would just convert all of this to solar. All right?

Speaker 7:          00:53:46       And uh, I would give, you know, all of the money to the oil companies and just say, listen, you're going to be out of this fucking business and we're going to help you go over to this other business. All right? So you're still getting all the money from the energy you cons. And then what's going to happen is there's going to be no fucking money in the Middle East and then they won't have any money to finance the terrorism. And then we're going to get the fuck out of there and leave them alone.

Speaker 2:          00:54:11       Okay.

Speaker 7:          00:54:12       That's what we're going to do. And then they can fucking live their lives and we're going to live our lives.

Speaker 2:          00:54:17       And then,

Speaker 7:          00:54:20       uh, I dunno if I would have the power to do this, but I would go and I would evict all the Jews out of Israel and all the Palestinians out of Palestine. Fuck. Where would I put them? I gotta Give Him Beach Front property cause it seems to be really important to those people.

Speaker 3:          00:54:35       Cool.

Speaker 7:          00:54:39       I give them all timeshares in Florida, Boca Raton, we get Ahca poco going again,

Speaker 2:          00:54:47       you know?

Speaker 7:          00:54:48       No, there's no, there's no self in the Middle East. But I would get us the fuck out of that Hornets nest is what I would do. And I would leave those people alone because it's their countries and they should be able to figure out what the fuck goes on in their countries. And I'd converted to solar power. That's what I was doing. My vice president would be somebody way smarter than me

Speaker 2:          00:55:06       and I would have them sound out all the big words in my speeches before I went on TV. So you guys all thought I was smart and you kept the faith. All right. Then I would go to blackwater and I would, uh, I would carve out a deal with them, um, where we would take the banking system back. All right. And, uh, we just whack a couple of top bankers. I didn't think we'd have to do that. We would just walk in and take them over. Take over. The banks are too big to fail. Is that what you think daisy? All right. Their friend and they would all go to fucking jail. Okay. And then the next one I would go to, let's just like in a perfect world, like every, like all the politicians who get paid by all these fucking crooked cops would somehow come along with me.

Speaker 2:          00:55:51       Then I would go to the food fucking industry and I would get al of those cons the fuck out of there. I'd find I'd go through their files and find out what's really in our food. And simultaneously you'd go to the pharmaceutical, uh, fucking industry and find out why the fuck what, what they knew about fentanyl and all of this. Because I've had a bunch of people that I know affected by it. I've had friends die, I've had, uh, friends have children die. It's just been fucking awful. That's what I would do. And then, um, I would, uh, and then the last thing I would do was I would try to have some sort of a recycling program that works. And, um, I dunno if that's what the fuck I would do and my vice president, who would it be? Who would it be? Um, oh, I, I get al Franken. I'd have him as a vice president. Goats, all comedians in office.

Speaker 5:          00:56:54       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:56:55       I Dunno. I try to just get people that actually give a shit about people rather than power and money. Like all of these other fucking assholes, like the bushes, the Obama's, the trumps, the Clintons, they just all bad people. Like, I feel like the last human being that was an office was Jimmy Carter

Speaker 5:          00:57:12       and

Speaker 2:          00:57:14       you know, let me look at the guy. What has he done since he's retired other than build 4,000 houses for the fucking homeless, all these other fucking assholes. What do they do? They go in though the, the speech tour and they go out and they give speeches to the biggest fucking anti American goddamn corporate crooks. Don't even get me started on this shit. I want to give me fucking started.

Speaker 10:         00:57:37       Yeah.

Speaker 2:          00:57:38       Where everybody loves fucking Obama in his first two speeches and with two of the biggest fucking predatory banks from fucking 2008. I mean, it's like they don't even try to hide, but he's got a blue tie. So I like them. It's like these fucking morons. It's that can't even admit that Trump is a fucking dope. I get it. You're Republican. I get it. You're conservative. I get it. You want a wall? I get all of that. If that's what the fuck you want. And I respected it. Fucking take it to the point where you can't say that this guy's a bit of a fucking, you know, I understand wind. Uh, I know all about the wind. I mean the fact that you're comfortable with that being your leader. I mean, I don't know what the fucking say to you. Yeah. That is as annoying as people who prop up.

Speaker 10:         00:58:21       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:58:21       You know, the Obama's like, these were these great fucking people rather than they were your typical politicians that had their faces in the fucking pig trough. Just like all of them. Just like all of them.

Speaker 5:          00:58:34       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:58:34       No, he wears a different color tie. He wears the color tie that I like. All right, let's get on. Let's not talk politics here. It just makes me annoyed and then I start acting like I can solve all the problems and that I know things that I really don't. So why don't we avoid that? Although that could be part of the entertainment though, right? Um, all right. What's the next thing here? Jesus Christ. This is a long email. Why the fuck is this here? Wife's a douchebag. Jesus Christ. Noisy sex. Ukraine president. Okay.

Speaker 5:          00:59:10       MMM.

Speaker 2:          00:59:10       Noisy neighbors having sex. Dear Bill, you are one of my favorite car of a thank you. Bye. Problem is I can hear my neighbor's having loud, obnoxious.

Speaker 7:          00:59:23       Well, it's the only way it's obnoxious is if they're doing it to annoy you, they might be lost in the throes of passion. When was the last time we want to fucking face off in this fucking game?

Speaker 1:          00:59:38       MMM.

Speaker 7:          00:59:39       Anyways,

Speaker 1:          00:59:42       uh,

Speaker 7:          00:59:42       loud, obnoxious sex at various times of the day, I left a note to them addressing the problem. They left a condescending response back with their phone number in it. Why on earth would I want to discuss their sex life with them? Oh, I would've called them back in a second. As you can see, I'm in quite the pickle here. That is my next move.

Speaker 1:          01:00:06       Uh,

Speaker 7:          01:00:06       and what should I do? Sinceriously your biggest fan from New Paltz, New York. Oh two this is easy. Go get yourself a sound system.

Speaker 7:          01:00:17       All right? You got to do a little research. Get us, get a sound system point of speakers at the walls of your neighbor's house. All right? And then what should do, I don't know if you can do a Google search. Find the most obnoxious sex sounds from a porno you watch. You ever watch a porno and somebody is like fucking over the top going like, oh wow. Like, you know, and it literally takes you out of it. I would record that on a loop and every time they have sex, you know, I would play that. Or you just make a tape of saying your mom's vagina, your mom's vagina, your mom's vagina is wet right now. Just anything that will make that guy lose his fucking hard on, have fun with it. And then just say that you're listening to a new song by Yoko Ono and the plastic ono band and you know, I think you'll get away with it. You gotta have fun with it, uh, recorded, you know, have somebody animate it and all of that shit with you and your fucking yeah, send us, send us audio of it. We, I have animators. I'll pay for it. We'll fucking, we'll fucking make a little cartoon it and then do that other shit. Just fucking annoying

Speaker 1:          01:01:34       back. Fuck them. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:01:40       and you also have their, uh, oh. And you could like put their phone up now. Don't, don't put their phone number out there that there'll be a mean thing. Uh, that'd be to meet taking it too far. Ah. Alright. Wife's Douchebag boss. Oh God. Your wife has a douchebag boss. So guess what you have to hear about every night at dinner. What's up bill? Billy Ball sniffer. Hoping forwards. Vice. Why is Scott at douchebag? Boss? Just a little background. Oh, this is gonna be one of these. No punctuations no capital letters. No nothing. Just a little background. My wife is 45. I'm 38 wife's Douchebag boss 28 this jackass. Thanks this Jack has thinks it's okay knowing she married.

Speaker 7:          01:02:30       Oh Jesus Christ. Dude. What the f this is even a fucking, this isn't going centers. This jackass thinks it's okay knowing she's married. Juju hit on her on a regular basis. Little more backstory. Last year at our Christmas party, we were all drinking and he decided there was okay to start hitting on her in front of me. She has a great job for a retail company in a, in a, in a mall, make 70 k a year. So I didn't want to screw it up, but beating the ever living crap out of him by, by beating the ever living crap out of him. I decided to let it slide the next day he apologized and let it and I let it go. Figuring he was just drunk, whoever since he likes to throw little comments about how she smells. Nice is dress great. The little prick even likes to walk up behind her and brush up against her act. Well, what the fuck? She can't just go to human resources at this point. You don't even need evidence to get where you got like fucking evidence of this shit. Just do that.

Speaker 7:          01:03:36       He says, cool. I know my wife is not the cheating type or she wouldn't be telling me all this. Yesterday she came home, send me upset and told me while she was in the food court eating lunch, he came up behind her and told her, you think she would be great in bed. So here's my question, before I drag this little shit stain down to the food court and po and pull a good fellows and stick his fucking head in the pizza oven, what should I do? So I don't end up going to jail. This advice would be great. Maybe something from near, it's near with an n, not meal with an m. Um, now you can't do that because then you're going to go to jail and he won't, I don't understand why she doesn't complain to somebody.

Speaker 7:          01:04:19       I mean, at this point, all she would have to do is go on Twitter saying who the fuck he was in his career would be over. I think she can just threaten to do that. But if you fucking say one more goddamn thing to me, sexually or otherwise, I will go online and I will end you fucking career faster than you can say Harvey Weinstein. Alright. Um, I actually think she should just go to human resources. I don't know why she doesn't. Uh, but you should not go and beat the shit out of this guy because you're going to get caught and you're going to go to jail. Um, and then that guy is going to continue PR and then you think he's brushing up against your wife as then. Forget about when. What about when you're locked up? Don't do that. I think you should. You should go to the proper channels here. All right, advice. My wife is disgusted by my, for skin, a brother. 10 minutes to go 10 minutes ago. Please tell me we're not playing. Not to lose. I mean not to uh, yeah, to not lose. However the expression goes.

Speaker 7:          01:05:20       Oh boy. Oh boy. You know they're going to tie it up. You know they're going to tie it up. Jay says Christ, get it out of there.

Speaker 3:          01:05:29       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:05:33       Oh my God. What are we doing? What are we doing? All right. Hey, billing, Billingham, fire crutch. Love the podcast and the advice you give. First off, I'm personally fine with my old twigs and berries and haven't thought before skin going to be an issue. But recently my wife of two years has confessed that it makes her gag. I noticed her reluctance to the one eyed snake from the first time we were together. My first thought was she didn't like them face to face or maybe she was the size was the size of my staff that she didn't like. It's not live very long, but I am girthy and that's fine with me. I like to make the joke. I may not be able to touch the bottom of the tuna can, but I can touch all the sides.

Speaker 1:          01:06:22       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:06:24       Long story short.

Speaker 3:          01:06:26       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:06:26       She's asked slash demanded that I get surgery to remove the excess. I don't know how to take that. Isn't love beyond the physical. Thank you very much built. Um, I'll tell you this right now. There is no fucking way you could ever tell your wife to do something like that. Um,

Speaker 7:          01:06:44       I don't know what to tell you, dude. You need to talk to a professional about this one. I can tell you this. If someone was going to make me remove something from my Dick, uh, they would have to be in writing a guaranteed number of blow jobs per month. Here's the thing, dude, what do you, if you do that and then she still doesn't like your Dick, you know there's been women that married guys and then they get divorced and then all of a sudden they have a girlfriend. You find out they're gay. Anything can fucking happen before you start cutting shit off your Dick. Fuck that. That Shit Dick. I wouldn't do it.

Speaker 1:          01:07:17       I wouldn't do it.

Speaker 7:          01:07:21       I wouldn't do it. And I think it's really fucked up that you know that she married you. If she was looking, if she fucking went on a date with you and the first time you took out your little fucking a stumpy fifth thing there.

Speaker 1:          01:07:36       Aye

Speaker 7:          01:07:38       Is. She should have been honest with the, instead of fucking gross me out and you guys could have left it at that. Now she's two years into this shit. This is, this is all her fault for not fucking communicating to you that she thinks should dick is gross. And I'm to tell you right now, dude, do not fucking do that on any level. Fuck you. This is my Dick. This is the deck I showed up with and this is the deck I'm leaving with.

Speaker 1:          01:08:02       Okay.

Speaker 7:          01:08:05       And if she walks, she fucking walks, dude. Fuck that. I'm telling you right now. Don't do it. I got a bag. I remember platoon. I got a bad feeling about this one, man. I got a bad feeling this could you say to her, you know, uh, you know, you're fucking, I don't view your tits. Gross me out.

Speaker 7:          01:08:27       I Dunno. I Dunno man. I wouldn't do it. Don't fucking do it. That's, that's my advice. Do not do it. Keep your dick all original matching numbers, barn fine. Uh, Bruins. Almost scored in that fucking breakaway. God dammit. Then almost go had a breakaway but did not score. All right. Advice friend is, isn't prison. Hey Billy boullion. I have a huge problem that needs some need. Your advice? A friend of mine whom I've known since the late nineties recently went to prison. He was a great guy, funny guy. And we have the same sense of humor. We've stayed in touch for almost two decades, sharing life's adventures, family stories, joys and sorrows. So it was met with sadness when he emailed me a few months ago to explain that he was experiencing serious legal trouble. They had a potential decade in prison. Well, what did he do? Tax evasion. Embezzlement. He said he wasn't able to explain the details of the case. Uh, touch somebody. I emailed him back a week later to hope things worked out, whatever it was. I said I didn't need to know the details because I believed he was a good character. Eventually his wife responded and said, he's in prison. She offered to put me in contact with them. All right, well then he didn't touch somebody if she's still fucking there. And that's my guess, eight 36 to go.

Speaker 7:          01:09:56       Um, all right, so until, uh, today I kept in contact through the prison email service and he's been friendly and upbeat. I didn't ask about his situation because I thought that whatever he did can't be that bad and he won't want to talk about you is going to jail for 10 years. He did fucking did something. Guys don't talk about emotional stuff. After all, I told him to stay positive and just get through it the best he can. I wanted to show him pictures of my new car, but the prison email can't do attachment, so I asked my partner about posting some photos. She go, this president site, it's a federal prison. She asked me what he's in for. I honestly said, I don't know, and she started snooping.

Speaker 1:          01:10:43       Oh boy.

Speaker 7:          01:10:45       Then we found a new story from town. He pled guilty to having thousands of Kiddie porn pictures. There it is on his computer. It's 100% him, no doubt. Not a case of mistaken identity. I feel so dumb for not googling his name months ago. So bill, my question is what do I do? The easy answer is to ignore him and cut him out of my life. That was my first thought, but I'm also human and he's alone. Sitting in a prison cell, realizing his mistake is possible to someone still be a friend to this guy. Can pedophiles change as far as I've seen? No, not even remotely. Could you somehow change what you're attracted to? You're attracted to what you're attracted to. I don't want to lose my friend because I don't have many, but he did unforgivable things. I feel let down. But he supported me as a friend for 20 years. What do I do? Well, I think you just answered it. You, you're a good friend and he's a good friend. But, uh, you just said what he did was unforgivable. So if it's unforgivable, you can't forgive him.

Speaker 1:          01:11:53       MMM.

Speaker 7:          01:11:54       I Dunno dude. I'm sorry. Go through. It's pretty heavy fucking email. As a father, it's easy to just cut them out of your life too. You're a father, you have kids yet you got to get rid of this guy. You gotta get rid of them anyways. But imagine if you can, if one of your good friends did this, I can't forgive him. But this moral ethical decision is killing me. Thank you very much for your time and go fuck yourself. The last email was long and takes a turn. Wasn't sure if you want to read it or not, but I threw it in there. That's hilarious. He sent that after he's after the email text. Um, yeah. Uh, if you think you owe it to him as a friend to explain why.

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       MMM,

Speaker 7:          01:12:39       I would do that. But yeah, it's, it's a rap and then I would just, if you feel bad about it, I would just talk to my wife about her or if you feel you need to go talk to somebody about it, I would do that. Um, but dude, you got kids. You May, you know those people that are sick, there's something wrong with them when they haven't been able to figure out how to fix them. And you got to protect yourself and your family. So sometimes you know, you got to choose yourself. And I think this is an easy one. You said it yourself. What he did was unforgivable. All right. That is the podcast. All right. You guys have a great couple of days here and I'll check in on you on Thursday. Um, those of you who want to listen to the final five minutes and nine, eight, seven seconds of this fucking game, uh, you can listen to the rest of this fucking podcast.

Speaker 4:          01:13:27       Yeah.

Speaker 7:          01:13:29       All right. Now we're in, now we're in overtime for the podcast. Get fucking so Dadi sleeping. Just screamed and I yelled the f word. Oh, Toronto is on the edge of their fucking seats here. I love going. They keep fucking Shannon Tucows name like Keith that's going to rattle him. He's been playing great. They scored on a deflection. Do you know, can't blame a goalie for a deflection. Um, men, the second one was a nice goal. I could live with both of those, especially if they don't score another one bro and spring in the pocket to the Czar God, down half wall

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       retina by some con from Toronto. Why didn't you fucking Ah, Jesus? Now they've got to clear the zone. Oh my God, it was right there. You know what happens when you miss one of those? The other team fucking scores. Jesus Christ to viruses. Matthews out there too. They're on a different line. Thank Christ. You know at the end of the game, that bolt's going to be out there. The fucking goalie pulled. Why do I do this? Why don't, why? Why do I give a shit? You know? Look at his asshole standing up. Get the fuck out of the way. Oh, look at that sweet rebound. Just sitting there waiting to be picked up. Let me turn this up so you can at least hear it.

Speaker 3:          01:15:10       Okay.

Speaker 2:          01:15:18       Three Oh nine ago, three Oh eight to go. Yeah. You know you want to game seven right? Tell me you want to game seven. That's right. Two one one

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       He just goes, it's wonderful, isn't it? Now if your heart's in a fucking game, it's wonderful.
