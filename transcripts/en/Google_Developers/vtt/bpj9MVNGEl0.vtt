SILVANO LUCIANI:
Hi, everybody.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.340
And welcome back to Google+
Developers Live.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.340
I am Silvano Luciani, and I'm a
developer programs engineer

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.620
for Google+.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.410
JOANNA SMITH: And I'm Joanna
Smith, and I am also a

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.375
developer programs engineer
for Google+.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:23.510
And today, we are here
to talk to you about

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.700
Google+ Platform Insights.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.430
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yes, the goal
is to get you fully set up to

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:31.680
learn as much as you can about
your app from these extra

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.530
analytics for Google+ Sign-In.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.230
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.360
But first, we want to take a
moment to really talk about

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.880
what are Google+ Platform
Insights.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.180
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yes,
good point.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.530
As mentioned, Google+ Platform
Insights are a set of Google

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.300
Analytics that are specific
to Google+ Sign-In

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.770
functionalities, such as
the Google+ Sign-In and

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.440
interactive posts.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.740
JOANNA SMITH: So for the Sign-In
button specifically,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:56.020
we have two different things.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.930
You can compare your total
number of users against the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.640
number of new users for
a given time period.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.459
And then for an interactive
post, you have the ability to

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:07.320
track the viral spread of
a post through multiple

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.500
different metrics.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.730
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yes, we provide
data on the number of

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.300
interactive posts published,
post views, clicks,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.950
clickthrough rate, and on-app
install clicks.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.660
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.300
And then, because it's Google
Analytics, you can look at all

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.860
of this data over a period
of 30 days or over

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.450
a period of 7 days.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.090
And you can also break it down
by platform between web,

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.300
Android, and iOS, which gives
you the full ability to track

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.420
what your users are doing and
where they're doing it.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.090
SILVANO LUCIANI: And to get
access to all of this data,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.520
the first thing that you need to
do is link your + page with

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.410
your project in the Google
API Console.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.640
To do this, we have
instructions at

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.940
developers.googl
e.com/+/features/analytics.

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:52.690
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.950
And these are the instructions
that I'm going to follow and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.970
show you today, so you can
follow along if you're

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:57.810
interested.

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.590
But to get there, let's take a
look at our documentation.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.820
And so if you're exploring the
documentation in general, you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.010
can find these instructions
through the left nav under

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.140
Features, Insights.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.410
But what we have here is we
have a lot of information

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.610
about what Google+ Platform
Insights are.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.440
And you can learn about the
different metrics that are

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.410
available, and also some ideas
of what they might mean for

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.850
you as a developer.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.440
And at the bottom of the page,
we have set up instructions.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.525
And they're very specific.

00:02:21.525 --> 00:02:22.670
They're very clear.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.610
And you shouldn't have
any trouble.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.360
But if you do, be sure
to let us know.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.170
So the first step is just
to get the + page ID.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.690
And you can do that from
the + page dashboard.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.670
So to find this dashboard, you
can actually click on the link

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.960
there, or you can find it from
the left nav within Google+

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.650
and click on Pages.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.950
And you'll see every + page
that you are a manager of.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.850
So this is my test
page for today.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.300
And what I'm going to do is
I'm going to click on

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.280
Connected Services.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.450
And this takes me to a page, and
I can see that the Google

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.230
APIs Console is one of
the options already.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.900
And if I click Start, this
is how I'm going to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.150
find my + page ID.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.930
So you can go ahead and copy
this to your clipboard.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.180
And then if you're interested,
you can click through the rest

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.980
of the wizard to see what the
next steps are going to be.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.690
But I already know the rest of
the steps, and I'm going to

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.490
show you, so let's skip
ahead to that.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.780
So within the Google APIs
Console, which we've taken you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.010
to multiple times, there
are multiple tabs.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.130
But for today, all you need
to worry about is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.160
the Overview tab.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.630
Because all we care about is
this Google+ Page field, where

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.930
you can request a connection.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.550
And all you have to do is
paste in the + page ID.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.870
But we are Google, and we care
about security, so it's not so

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.730
simple as just having an ID.

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.170
You'll see that this
says pending.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:37.260
And what that means is that you
have to go back to your

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.290
dashboard, go ahead
and refresh the

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.540
Connected Services tab.

00:03:43.925 --> 00:03:45.970
Let's find it.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.600
So go back to Connected
Services.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.530
And you'll see that now we
have this API Console.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.610
And it will have the name and
the project number, which

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:56.710
aren't terribly descriptive,
but yours will be much more

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:57.620
indicative.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.030
And it's requesting
an approval.

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.120
And here, I can approve it.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.540
So we have a two-way mutual
approval street to really

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.950
protect your app.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.310
And so what happens now is if we
return to the dashboard one

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.250
more time, we will see that the
Platform Insights button

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.660
has replaced the Connected
Services tab, which has moved

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:13.890
into the More field.

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.550
So it's easy for you to get to
your insights very quickly.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.990
And now we have no data for me
because it's a new page.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.800
But you can break it down by
feature to see what's going on

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.260
between total users
or new users.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.590
Or switch to interactive
posts.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.970
And maybe I only care about
the non-existent web data.

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.420
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.270
So at this point, as you can
see, you can start learning a

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.900
lot about how your
app is behaving.

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.560
Unfortunately, Joanna's demo
page doesn't have any data.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.500
But we are sure that your app
will be far more interesting.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.640
And we are sure that Google+
Insights will be a valuable

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.540
resource for you.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.090
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.840
And so the other thing we wanted
to mention today is

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.340
related to an announcement that
we made this morning.

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.740
And if you're watching this GDL,
you're probably already

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.120
convinced of our many different
value propositions

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.400
for Google+ Sign-In.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.960
But this morning's announcement
just is one more

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.690
reason to really strive for a
deep integration with Google+.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.070
And what we talked about was
we announced our app

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.020
activities integration
with search.

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.810
So you can really start to see
some of the Google+ data that

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.580
you as a developer get to write
surfacing within search.

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.330
And what this means is that
using Google+ Sign-In is more

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.750
than Google+.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.780
It's a gateway to Google.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.560
And when you write data, like
app activities, you are

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.150
writing that data not just to
a user's profile, but to

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.890
Google so that we can surface it
in interesting and creative

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.700
ways across all of
our products.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.540
So this is just the beginning,
and we're really excited to

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.160
see what this will mean for
you as a developer.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:44.600
SILVANO LUCIANI: Yeah.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.640
And to find more about it, go
check the announcement on the

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.820
Google+ Developers Blog
at googleplusplatfo

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.840
rm.blogspot.com.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.090
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.530
SILVANO LUCIANI:
Now, let's see.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.330
No.

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.580
We don't have any questions
for this episode.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.450
So if you want to learn more
about Google+ Platform, you

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:09.670
can find more details in our
documentation site at

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.400
developers.google.com/+.

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.360
And also, remember, if you have
any questions, please

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.940
reach out to us in the
Google+ developer

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:19.570
community on Google+.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.140
JOANNA SMITH: Exactly.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.520
Or you can use the Stack
Overflow tag Google-plus

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.750
because we check that every day,
and we really like to be

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.800
able to answer your questions
and help you.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.660
And then of course, if you just
want to learn about the

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:32.220
product, and maybe get started
with tinkering with it on your

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:35.030
own, you can see all of our
language examples at

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.420
github.com/googleplus.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.420
SILVANO LUCIANI: And last but
not least, if you find a bug

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:44.880
in our APIs, or you have any
suggestion or feature request,

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.910
use our issue tracker.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.480
Please, file requests,
file bugs.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.610
And also, star the bugs in the
feature requests you agree

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.030
with because we use the star
when we triage the bugs and

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:56.370
feature requests every week.

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.710
JOANNA SMITH: So I do.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.980
I triage those every week.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.980
So please star things that
are important to you.

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.630
Because that will let me know
that the developers think that

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.650
issue is important.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.060
So that's everything that
we have for you today.

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.150
We hope that Platform Insights
really help you out.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:08.740
And thanks for joining us.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.990
SILVANO LUCIANI: Bye.
