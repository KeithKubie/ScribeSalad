00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.300
Hi, I’m Emily Graslie and this is Crash
Course Big History, and today we’re talking

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.769
about globalization - a process that goes
back hundreds of years, and deeply impacted

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.629
the collective learning of humanity.

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.070
As we’ve discussed in previous episodes,
collective learning is the process that has

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.380
raised the complexity of human societies for
all 250,000 years of our history.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.940
It’s the accumulation of more innovation
with each generation than is lost by the next.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.060
It allowed us to get better at foraging, spread
out across the world and adapt to the harshest

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.060
of environments.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.199
It gave birth to agriculture, industry, and
every other revolutionary technology.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.550
But collective learning has its vital ingredients
with the number of potential innovators and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.710
the connectivity of information flows between
them.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.700
Globalization, in its broadest possible sense,
brought the previously separate world zones

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.829
of Afro-Eurasia, the Americas, Australasia,
and the Pacific Island Societies together,

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.280
with both positive andv negative impacts.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.449
Today we’ll look at how three things were
shaped in the earliest waves of globalization

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.139
and how they revolutionised our pool of collective
learning, for better or for worse: printing,

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:12.140
potatoes, and plagues.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.350
Previously in Crash Course Big History, we
looked at how humans spread out of Africa

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.290
64,000 years ago.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.710
We expanded across Asia over the next 20,000
years and even accomplished the astounding

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.810
feat of settling Australia.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.740
We entered Europe and Siberia 40,000 to 25,000
years ago, and hunted animals across the Bering

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.110
Strait and down into North and South America.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
These migrations weren’t so rapid in human
terms- they took thousands and thousands of

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.920
years.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.860
Even though humans inhabited almost every
region of the globe, we didn’t maintain

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.340
regular contacts between the major world zones.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.700
The Americas were isolated in many ways, and
for over 10,000 years, they developed and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.950
diversified into lots of different cultures,
eventually giving rise to agrarian states

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:50.950
in Mesoamerica.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.730
Before Columbus, before the Vikings, and,
as some historians assert, before the Chinese

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.460
sailed off the coasts of America, there were
thousands of years where the collective learning

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.030
of the Americas was done entirely by the Americas.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.320
And we see surprisingly similar results in
the rest of the world.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.170
The origin of agriculture, the beginning of
states and empires, and the development of

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.040
monumental architecture including pyramid
building happened independently.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.160
In Australasia and the Pacific, environments
were largely rich enough in resources for

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.740
populations to thrive without agriculture.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.030
For instance, in Australia, humans engaged
in a practice called “fire-stick farming”

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.230
which isn’t the plant and animal domestication
we usually refer to as agriculture.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.810
Instead it was foraging through the use of
setting large forest fires that would clear

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.120
new pathways through the brush, kill and cook
a large amount of game, and take advantage

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.840
of the round of rejuvenation that naturally
follows a forest fire.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.170
Early agriculture usually leads to a decline
in the living standards of the foragers who

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.540
adopt it, in terms of malnutrition, back-breaking
labour, and the resulting diseases and famines.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.000
Humans only give up foraging when they are
trapped by a lack of new ecosystems or by

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.290
population pressure.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.290
Or both.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.020
Australasia only developed agriculture in
Papua New Guinea.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.349
The largest world zone, Afro-Eurasia, had
a lot of advantages from the start in many

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.349
ways.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.850
We group Africa, Europe, and Asia into one
world zone because there was transference

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:12.450
of collective learning - even if it was halting
and rarely traversed long distances.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.599
For instance, the silk roads enabled trade
right from China to the West of Africa and

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.930
to Europe for thousands of years.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.099
Most individual traders didn’t travel the
entire silk road, but piece by piece and trader

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.410
by trader, goods and information would travel
the entire route.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.800
It wasn’t exactly a brimming information
super-highway but it was something!

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.959
In the past 10,000 years, agriculture independently
arose in Afro-Eurasia several times: in the

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.470
Fertile Crescent, in East Asia, and in West
Africa.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.180
Agricultural surplus gave rise to agrarian
states, which then slowly grew in size.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.350
So, now we’ve reached the first wave of
globalization.

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.430
Starting with the sustained colonization of
the Americas over 500 years ago, continuing

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.490
with the colonization of Australasia and the
Pacific 200 to 300 years ago, humanity once

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:58.160
again united into a single global system.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.880
This had a profound effect on the pace of
collective learning.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.550
Unsurprisingly, the modern revolution soon
followed.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.520
Like globalization today, the impacts took
many forms.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.319
Some of them were positive and some of them
catastrophically negative and that brings

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.670
us to those three P’s, printing, potatoes,
and plagues.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.770
Firstly, printing.

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.620
While humanity has had collective learning
for 250,000 years, orally passing along knowledge

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.020
from generation to generation, I think we
can agree it’s a major step forward to write

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.169
something down.

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.540
Sort of like a giant post it note for humanity,
we can capture things in text to remind ourselves

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.560
of something in case we ever forget.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.780
Writing also allowed for the communication
of more complex and sometimes abstract ideas.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.200
Even with writing, the greatest limitation
on collective learning is the circulation

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.530
of written works.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:43.590
Most information was still passed on orally.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.210
Literacy was relatively rare until the modern
era.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.680
The books that were produced had to be copied
out by hand which was a process that took

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.410
a long time and could include numerous mistakes,
and it made books so expensive that they were

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.470
essentially luxury goods.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.650
Printing first emerged in China around 200
BCE.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.800
Blocks of wood were carved with the imprint
the printer wanted to make on the page.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.750
It did mean, however, that each page had to
be skillfully carved, which ate up a lot of

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.380
time when trying to compile a full book.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.400
Every page had a unique woodblock.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.030
Around 1050 CE, the Chinese invented movable
type, where different characters on clay tablets

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.660
could be rearranged to create a new imprint.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.770
But the thousands of unique characters made
the process impractical for most printers.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.710
And until the 20th century, printing in China
was still dominated by the woodblock.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:31.020
In the 1200s, the Koreans developed their
own metal moveable type which was more efficient

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.470
than clay tablets.

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:36.500
There was no printing press of any kind, but
instead the paper was pressed onto the inked

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.220
type with a wooden spatula.

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.590
These methods allowed East Asia to circulate
way more copies of books than ever before,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.000
at a rate that was much more efficient than
manuscripts copied by hand.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.110
In the meantime, paper and printing filtered
down the silk roads into the Arab world and

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.650
by 900 CE, book production had advanced dramatically.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:57.990
The Middle East mostly had hand-written books,
but printing undeniably played a role, copying

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.790
and disseminating knowledge wider and faster,
even in its woodblock form.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.580
The Middle East widely used woodblock techniques
to stamp amulets and playing cards.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.919
This stamping practice eventually reached
Europe via the Crusades.

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.910
In Europe, printing became more rapid thanks
to the combination of stamping an imprint

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.890
on a page via moveable type and a press inspired
by the wine press.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.380
This had a profound impact on collective learning.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.509
When Gutenberg developed the printing press
around 1450, the largest library in Europe

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:26.419
was in the Vatican, and it was around 2000
books.

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.460
A few centuries later in the 1800s a well-to-do
middle class lawyer could easily compile a

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.980
similarly sized collection.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.910
Book printing went into overdrive.

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:40.520
In just the short span of 50 years, between
1450 and 1500, there were more books printed

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.520
in Europe than had been hand-copied in the
past 600 years.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.010
Printing presses grew more and more efficient.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.840
By the 19th century when roller presses got
involved, book production was quick and cheap.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.889
Written knowledge became available to more
people.

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:57.910
This fueled the scientific revolution, allowed
for rapid exchange of extremely complex ideas,

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.050
and greatly enhanced the connectivity of information
between millions and millions of potential

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.050
innovators.

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:04.050
OK, onto the potato.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.050
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:09.550
The potato, humble hero of collective learning,
is a root vegetable first domesticated in

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:12.080
Mesoamerica when farming was first getting
started.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.360
It has many important advantages for agrarian
societies that literally live and die by the

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360
harvest.

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.970
(1) Potatoes can grow in all sorts of climates
and environments.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.039
(2) They enrich the soil rather than completely
draining its nutrients.

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:26.860
They’re a cheap source of energy for humans,
and unlike wheat, don’t take as much work

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:27.860
to prepare.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:32.560
In fact, the potato gained the nickname, “ready-made
bread” for its miraculous properties in

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.540
a world before TV dinners.

00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:39.690
Potatoes fostered and fed the agrarian societies
of Peru and Bolivia for thousands of years.

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:43.900
In these environments it wasn’t possible
to grow that other American crop – maize.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.870
But I’ll stick to one side of the grocery
aisle for now.

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:50.509
The potato was established in Europe in the
1500s, due to Spanish and other European sailors

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:53.550
packing them to eat on their trips back from
the Americas.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:58.259
Its yields played a big role in the agricultural
revolution in the seventeenth and eighteenth

00:07:58.259 --> 00:08:01.560
centuries, which was a vital pre-cursor for
the industrial revolution.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:05.560
What is less well known is how the potato
was also introduced into East Asia in the

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.759
1600s, where it was gradually adopted along
with other American crops like yams and maize,

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:13.710
and helped to raise the carrying capacity
of the growing population.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.600
Some historians assert that the introduction
of the potato helped delay some of the worst

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.449
famines in Asia by a century.

00:08:19.449 --> 00:08:23.500
And the potato raising the carrying capacity
of East Asia brings us back to collective

00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500
learning.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.850
Printing may have enhanced connectivity, but
the potato led to a clear increase in the

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:29.060
number of potential innovators.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.060
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:08:30.060 --> 00:08:34.270
But when talking about the history of potatoes
it’s important to mention the Irish Potato

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:39.050
Famine, where reliance on mostly one vulnerable
kind of potato and government inaction led

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.440
to the starvation or migration of millions
of people.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.990
Or its introduction into Africa where for
generations it was viewed as a symbol of colonial

00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.990
oppression.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.760
These are definitely negative impacts of early
globalization

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.310
And on that cheerful note, let’s go onto
the last of our three P’s, which is definitely

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:56.500
the least fun.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:57.500
Plagues.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:01.190
Afro-Eurasia, with its teeming populations
and domestication of animals again had the

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:02.850
lead - this time, in disease.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:06.470
It’s thought that the plague of Justinian
in the 6th century CE and the Black Death

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.370
in the 14th century CE both arose out of the
agrarian lifestyles of humans.

00:09:11.370 --> 00:09:14.770
And with higher population densities, these
diseases can spread rapidly.

00:09:14.770 --> 00:09:18.740
It didn’t help that Afro-Eurasia was united
by the silk roads which carried the Black

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.550
Death across long distances.

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:24.510
Starting in 14th century East Asia, it killed
an estimated 25 million people.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:28.980
It then may have been spread by Mongol armies
across the super-continent, where most famously

00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:33.850
the Mongols besieging the Crimean city of
Kaffa reportedly flung plague-ridden corpses

00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:35.490
over the city walls.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:39.240
Somehow plague eventually got picked up by
traders from Europe, where it killed one third

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:41.339
to one half of the population.

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:45.020
While Afro-Eurasia’s large populations may
have been great in terms of potential innovators,

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.880
it also produced a greater number of deadly
diseases.

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.440
And when those diseases were introduced to
the Americas, where people had not built up

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:55.279
resistances over previous generations, the
results were horrific.

00:09:55.279 --> 00:09:59.530
Measles, smallpox, and other illnesses struck
the Americas, for which they had no natural

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:00.570
immunity.

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:04.750
And the diseases spread with such lightning
speed that illness sometimes swept through

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:08.020
American populations faster than Europeans
moved inland.

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:09.630
We can’t understate this catastrophe.

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:13.850
While it is difficult to know for sure what
the pre-Columbian population of the Americas

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:19.270
was, the mid-range estimate is that these
diseases killed about 50 million people within

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:20.310
a hundred years.

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.910
This tragedy had a clear impact on collective
learning.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:27.170
The tremendous loss of human life wiped out
a massive number of potential innovators for

00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:28.940
several generations.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.720
The loss of population that came with the
Columbian Exchange devastated the cultures

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.810
of America, and crippled their ability to
contribute to humanity as a whole.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:40.330
As a result, European ideas came to dominate
in the Americas.

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:44.670
This homogenisation of culture is a familiar
aspect of globalization, and it doesn’t

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.170
always benefit the pace of collective learning.

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:52.620
The loss of 50 million people is an overwhelming
tragedy not just for the Americas, but for

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.200
humanity as a whole, and its repercussions
continue to be felt today.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.460
The process of early globalization, uniting
all the world zones, is not just important

00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:05.760
for human history, it’s also a crucial moment
for the unifying theme of 13.8 billion years

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:06.760
of change.

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:10.920
The acceleration of collective learning by
linking together the globe into a vibrant

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.740
and rapidly expanding pool of knowledge was
vital to the continued transformation of complexity

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:16.740
in our Universe.

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.580
And globalization is a process that has not
stopped.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.820
It’s intensifying, with all the positive
and negative impacts involved.

00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:27.280
But with luck, and a lot of wisdom, hopefully
the continued story of globalization will

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:32.050
avoid the horrific human costs of the past
and continue to weave us together in a world

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:35.650
of 7 billion, increasingly well-informed and
interconnected innovators.

00:11:35.650 --> 00:11:40.100
It is, after all, what will determine our
future, and the outcome of the cosmic tale

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:41.680
in our little corner of the Universe.

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.280
Thanks for watching.
