00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I'm now going to quiz you on Bayes Rule.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Say you own a house, and you know that the house might catch fire in your absence,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
but the probability of it catching fire--"f" over here--is small.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
It's a 10th of a percent--0.001.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's say every afternoon you talk to your neighbor, and every afternoon

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
you ask your neighbor, "Does my house burn?"

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Of course,you a little bit paranoid if you do this, but for the sake of the argument,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
let's just assume you do this every afternoon.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This afternoon he comes back and says, "Yes, it burns," so B.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You happen to know that the neighbor is not very truthful.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In fact, every time you ask him a question,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
you know there is a 0.1 chance--a 10% chance--the neighbor will just produce a lie

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and a 0.9 chance the neighbor actually speaks the truth.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So you ask him exactly one question--"Does my house burn?"

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
He says, "Yes, it burns," but you know that the probability of this being a lie is 0.1.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So in applying Bayes Rule I like to first compute the non-normalized posterior--p bar--

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
bar now stands for non-normalized--of fire given the neighbor just called.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The same for the opposite event of no fire given the neighbor just said, yes, it burns.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
After you've done this, I'd like you to compute the normalized values

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
that have to add up to 1.

00:01:23.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Please enter all 4 values for this homework assignment.
