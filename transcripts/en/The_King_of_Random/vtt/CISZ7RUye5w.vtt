00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.220
For this project I’m going to show you how
to turn a dollar-store tablecloth into a super

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.870
simple parachute, that’s easy to make and
impressively effective. So whether you’re

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.219
launching rockets or throwing Sky Balls in
the park, you’ll be able to make an endless

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.899
supply of canopies for all your arial activities.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.040
Let’s start this project with some plastic
table covers. These rectangular ones are from

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.480
the dollar-store and there are loads of different
colors you could choose from, and as you might

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.189
have guessed, I’m going with yellow.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:30.980
If you look closely at the ends, you should
see that the material is smooth and folded

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.610
over on one side, while the other side has
all the straight cuts. And it’s important to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.870
remember which is which.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.960
Now this needs to be trimmed down just a little,
so measure 13” from the smooth end of the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.580
bundle, and double-check that the side you’re
about to cut, is the one with all the loose ends.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.540
I’m using an X-ACTO knife and a straight
edge to try and get a clean cut, but you could

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.850
use a pair of scissors just as well.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.280
Now that it’s trimmed, go ahead and unfold
the tablecloth lengthwise, then cut a piece

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.630
exactly 26” from one of the ends. You should
end up with a rectangle that’s 13” x 26”,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.079
and you’ll find that a quick and easy way
to mass produce these into parachute canopies,

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.260
is with a little origami.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.610
Start by folding the rectangle in half to
form a square and make sure the bottom right

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.900
corner has the 4 loose ends. If it does, then
put your pointer finger on the corner to hold

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.400
it in place, and fold it point to point, forming
an isosceles right triangle.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.250
Now measure up 5 inches from the bottom, double
checking that the loose ends are on the right

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.909
side, then go ahead and cut the bottom piece
off. And you could use these scraps for making

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.020
micro parachutes if you wanted to.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.920
At this point, unfold your triangle and you’ll
see a little square chunk missing from the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.229
bottom right corner. If you unfold it again
two more times, you should end up with a giant

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.810
yellow cross. That’s awesome, but check
this out. There’s actually another layer

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.530
underneath, which means you just made two
of them without even realizing it.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.530
I cut up the rest of the tablecloth which
you can see made 8 separate canopies in about

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.640
3 minutes. So now that we’ve got all our
patterns cut, the next step is to assemble them.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.110
Grab a piece of tape about 2 inches long,
and press just the upper left section of it,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.250
to one of the corners, like this.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.369
Now pull the other corner over and line up
the two sides so you can tape them together,

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.990
and you should see the edges match perfectly
at the bottom.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.820
Alright, let’s flip the canopy over and
fold the other half of the tape around, so

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.060
we can stick it flat to the inside of the
parachute as well.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.580
If you do the same thing with all 4 corners,
you should see the canopy starting to take shape.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.719
Ok we’re ready to rig the parachute cording,
and for that I’m using this #3 crochet thread

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:22.679
I got from a local super center, but any other
kind of string will probably work just as well.

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.249
I also picked up some 1/4” braided elastic
cording, and a pack of #7 barrel swivels from

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:30.419
the fishing isle. You’ll see what those
are for in just a minute.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:34.889
Now our parachutes only need 2 strings, about
33” long, but in a effort to mass produce

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.209
them for 8 parachutes at once, I strung out
16 lines in a zig-zag pattern, then collected

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.480
them all together into one long bundle so
they could be cut at the same time.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.439
It’s a good idea to mark both ends of the
strings an inch and a half from the bottoms,

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.199
because these markings will make it a lot
easier when it’s time attach them to the canopy.

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.279
Cut the strings so they’re exactly 33 inches
long, and if you did it right that should

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:56.340
leave 1-1/2” on either end of the markings.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.449
Now to attach the lines to the parachute we’ll
need to cut a small piece of tape, and press

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:03.549
it onto the string so the bottom of the tape
lines up with the mark.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.079
Then attach the string to the inside of the
parachute, by pressing it flat to the plastic

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.340
cloth, making sure the mark lines up at the
very bottom.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.900
The bit of string at the top needs to be folded
over and secured into place as well, so use

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.129
a second piece of tape around 2” long, and
flatten the string down overtop.

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.469
Of course the other end of the string gets
attached the exact same way to the corner

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:24.779
right beside it, and after you attach the
second string to the other side, there’s

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.599
only one thing left to do.

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.730
Bring two of the attachment points together
so the marks on either end of the string match

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.329
up perfectly, then pull the parachute strings
completely straight.

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.900
Now without letting go of the strings, carefully
tie a knot near the end.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.120
After you’ve tied the other string the same
way, line the two loops beside each other

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.930
and thread them with some of the elastic cording.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.779
I’ve found that tying a couple square knots
and pulling them really really tight, will

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:48.349
make sure this connection never comes undone.

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.540
Now simply trim the excess with a pair of
scissors, and tie one of the swivel hooks

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.879
to the other end the same way. If you want,
you can even attach barrel swivels to both

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.739
ends of of the elastic cording, and make them
any length you need.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.790
This way, if your lines get tangled to the
point of frustration, they’ll be easy to

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.189
unclip and fix within seconds.

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.449
Now just for fun, I went ahead and made 8
different parachutes with various colored

00:04:07.449 --> 00:04:11.419
tablecloths, and used them to make a colorful
set of Sky Balls. If you launch one high into

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.779
the air, you’ll see a little parachute opens
up, which adds another dimension to the fun

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:18.820
you can have outdoors. They’re super fun,
and hardly take any time to make, so look

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.549
for how to build these in another project
video.

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.250
Of course my favorite way to use these simple
cutes, is with the homemade Randomizer Rocket

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.970
we made in another video, and it only takes
a couple of simple modifications to work with these rockets.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.850
First, make sure your elastic cording is tied
securely to your parachute, then cut it off

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.570
around 13 inches long. And secondly, instead
of 1 swivel clip, I recommend using 2, to

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.780
be extra sure your rockets come back safely.
These simple chutes are lightweight, low cost,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.500
and look impressively professional, considering
what they’re made from.

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.280
Now packing your chute is as simple as holding
it at the center, then squeezing it all together

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.420
and rolling it up. You might want to fold
the material in half, and give it another

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.920
squeeze to get rid of any air, but essentially,
all you need to do is roll it up and wrap

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.450
the strings around the outside, which will
help hold the bundle together until it deploys.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.080
Well now you know how to convert the humble
plastic tablecloth, into a boat load of parachute

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.710
recovery systems. So weather you plan on making
Sky Balls, or launching rockets, you’ll

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.180
have a much better chance recovering them,
undamaged.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.430
By the way, if you don’t feel like building
a rocket or crafting a set of Sky Balls, these

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:19.280
parachutes can easily be modified to fit your
favorite toys, or action figures as well.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.130
Well that’s it for now. If you like this
project perhaps you’ll like some of my others.
