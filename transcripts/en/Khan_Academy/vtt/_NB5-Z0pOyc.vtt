00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:04.006
Male 1: In the last few videos
we looked at the final version,

00:00:04.006 --> 00:00:07.744
the Declaration of Independence
as it was approved of.

00:00:07.744 --> 00:00:10.738
Here it seems like we
have a very not final

00:00:10.738 --> 00:00:12.245
version of the Declaration.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:14.303
Male 2: What's really
amazing is they go through

00:00:14.303 --> 00:00:16.556
five drafts at least of the Declaration.

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:19.408
It's wonderful to watch
how each of the drafts

00:00:19.408 --> 00:00:23.200
changes. You have this
committee of real people.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.944
Jefferson and Adams and Franklin are all

00:00:25.944 --> 00:00:28.930
part of that committee. Jefferson is using

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.998
a lap desk, one of those
little things he invented,

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:33.533
so he could stand up or sit down

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:36.245
and write this in a little
room on Market Street.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.608
Then he shows it to Adams
and he shows it to Franklin,

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:41.082
very deferential, he
said, "With your broadened

00:00:41.082 --> 00:00:42.823
view of the world, Dr. Franklin, perhaps

00:00:42.823 --> 00:00:44.404
you can make some suggestions."

00:00:44.404 --> 00:00:46.413
Male 1: Franklin and
Adams could be his father.

00:00:46.413 --> 00:00:48.778
Male 2: Right, right. Jefferson's only 33.

00:00:48.778 --> 00:00:52.411
Really, really young.
You have Franklin and

00:00:52.411 --> 00:00:56.247
Adams, Franklin's hitting
70s then, and very

00:00:56.247 --> 00:00:59.246
much of a father figure. But you see real

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:02.412
people working together in these rooms on

00:01:02.412 --> 00:01:03.939
Market Street in Philadelphia,

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:06.003
trying to craft this document.

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:07.231
Male 1: Yeah, yeah, and you see it here.

00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.271
This looks like someone editing a paper.

00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:11.740
Male 2: Which shows you how
important it is to edit,

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.552
in a way. Those of us who
are writers and editors,

00:01:15.552 --> 00:01:19.880
we like the fact that
you should really quibble

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.003
over each word. These
are words that matter.

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:26.200
For example, you can
see they put in a little

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.336
phrase right here, "separate
and equal station."

00:01:29.336 --> 00:01:31.413
In other words, America's
going to become a

00:01:31.413 --> 00:01:33.742
separate nation and an equal nation.

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:36.417
That word "separate and
equal" actually goes

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:38.606
down in American history
with some resonance

00:01:38.606 --> 00:01:41.411
because it's used for a
while to defend segregation.

00:01:41.411 --> 00:01:46.802
Even when they get the
words almost perfect,

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:49.581
they have a resonance that
they have to be careful about.

00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:51.873
Male 1: Do you think they realized when

00:01:51.873 --> 00:01:53.535
they were writing it how important this

00:01:53.535 --> 00:01:54.606
document was going to be?

00:01:54.606 --> 00:01:56.945
Male 2: One of the
amusing things is this was

00:01:56.945 --> 00:01:58.746
not considered the most
important committee

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:02.913
to be on in June and July of 1776.

00:02:02.913 --> 00:02:04.996
In fact, John Adams thinks
he's already written

00:02:04.996 --> 00:02:07.747
the great document of American Revolution,

00:02:07.747 --> 00:02:10.499
which is a document
written in May asking the

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.336
various colonies to get rid of their Royal

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:16.473
governors because we
were going to break away.

00:02:16.473 --> 00:02:18.876
So Adams is quite willing
to let Jefferson write

00:02:18.876 --> 00:02:22.336
this draft because he
thinks that this is not

00:02:22.336 --> 00:02:24.236
the most important of all the documents.

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:27.824
Male 1: And on some level,
to defend Adams a little bit,

00:02:27.824 --> 00:02:29.493
that does seem like a
big deal. This was in

00:02:29.493 --> 00:02:32.411
May of 1776 he writes once
you're getting rid of your

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:34.335
Royal governors you really
are separating yourself.

00:02:34.335 --> 00:02:39.211
Male 2: And they've already
had a vote to be independent.

00:02:39.211 --> 00:02:41.339
So this is just a document,

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.875
"let Facts be submitted
to a candid world,"

00:02:43.875 --> 00:02:47.827
"the opinions of mankind ...
they should declare the causes."

00:02:47.827 --> 00:02:50.871
This is really just their
public relations document.

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:54.806
But, the reason it turns
out to be so important

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:57.828
is it's so beautifully written, it becomes

00:02:57.828 --> 00:03:01.247
the American creed. When
they get together in

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:04.536
these rooms and edit
it, suddenly they say,

00:03:04.536 --> 00:03:08.075
"All men are created equal."
This becomes not just

00:03:08.075 --> 00:03:11.466
a propaganda document,
but a mission statement

00:03:11.466 --> 00:03:12.751
for who we are as a people.

00:03:12.751 --> 00:03:16.543
Male 1: And to some degree
the power of poetry.

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:18.336
They could have said
these exact same things

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:20.206
in very terse and ...

00:03:20.206 --> 00:03:22.003
Male 2: This is why it
was so good Jefferson

00:03:22.003 --> 00:03:24.938
wrote it because Franklin
is a very good writer,

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:27.500
but he's a very simple, plain writer.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.944
He writes Poor Richard's Almanac,

00:03:28.944 --> 00:03:30.663
"A penny saved is a penny earned."

00:03:30.663 --> 00:03:33.412
He's one of the first
Americans not to write

00:03:33.412 --> 00:03:36.493
in a very flowery way. John Adams' letters

00:03:36.493 --> 00:03:38.948
are very beautiful, but
they're kind of pompous

00:03:38.948 --> 00:03:41.050
and orotund and self important.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.936
You have a beautiful poet in Jefferson,

00:03:44.936 --> 00:03:47.997
but as we're looking at
this document on the screen,

00:03:47.997 --> 00:03:51.196
even he benefits from some good edits.

00:03:51.196 --> 00:03:52.748
Male 1: This is literally Jefferson's

00:03:52.748 --> 00:03:54.074
handwriting we see here.

00:03:54.074 --> 00:03:55.746
Male 2: This is Jefferson's
handwriting on the

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.603
first draft. It's in
the Library of Congress

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.133
if you want to go see
it. The final document

00:04:00.133 --> 00:04:03.161
is in the National Archives,
about eight blocks away.

00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:05.666
It's really wonderful
to look at all of these

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.269
documents, especially,
I mean what do you see

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.881
here where they edit the
great second paragraph?

00:04:11.881 --> 00:04:15.542
Male 1: "We hold these
truths to be self evident."

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.936
You mentioned earlier that before it was

00:04:17.936 --> 00:04:19.210
written, what, "sacred and ...

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:22.830
Male 2: Undeniable. Yeah.
They're using the word

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.604
"sacred" for the truths
when Jefferson writes the

00:04:26.604 --> 00:04:31.007
first draft. To me, if you
look at the backslashes,

00:04:31.007 --> 00:04:33.919
the dark backslashes there, those are

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.416
Benjamin Franklin's
backslashes I'm pretty sure

00:04:37.416 --> 00:04:39.738
because he used a
printer's pen and he was a

00:04:39.738 --> 00:04:43.750
publisher, so he used that
sort of backslashes to

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.676
cross things out. He writes
the words "self evident."

00:04:47.676 --> 00:04:50.338
One of the things is we
historians never fully

00:04:50.338 --> 00:04:53.143
know. Carl Becker, who
was a great historian

00:04:53.143 --> 00:04:55.339
of the Declaration, he's
the one who said that

00:04:55.339 --> 00:04:58.537
that was probably Franklin's
edit. For me, I've spent

00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:01.417
a lot of time in Ben
Franklin's papers, which

00:05:01.417 --> 00:05:04.342
were at Yale University
Library. To me, it really

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:07.833
feels like his handwriting.
So we assume that it's

00:05:07.833 --> 00:05:10.874
Ben Franklin who takes
out "sacred" because he

00:05:10.874 --> 00:05:15.190
doesn't want "these truths"
to be based on religion.

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.333
He wants "these truths" to be based on

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:19.951
rationality and reason.

00:05:19.951 --> 00:05:22.006
Male 1: So once again
it's not only the style

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:24.419
of the crossing out, this is in line with

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.082
Franklin's personality and beliefs.

00:05:26.082 --> 00:05:28.827
Male 2: Franklin was somebody who had read

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:31.888
the great thinkers of
the British and Scottish

00:05:31.888 --> 00:05:35.826
Enlightenment. That means
John Locke, David Hume.

00:05:35.826 --> 00:05:38.069
David Hume was a person
who came up with the

00:05:38.069 --> 00:05:40.688
concept of "self evident
truths." A self evident

00:05:40.688 --> 00:05:44.251
truth would be that all
bachelors aren't married,

00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:49.332
as opposed to a more contingent truth like

00:05:49.332 --> 00:05:51.320
Philadelphia is smaller than London.

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:52.947
Male 1: Kind of in math an axiom.

00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:55.323
Male 2: An axiom,
exactly. The fact that two

00:05:55.323 --> 00:06:00.249
plus three is five,
that's not something that

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.869
has to be further proved.
These are somewhat

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:06.080
"self evident." That's what Hume does and

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.339
Franklin loves that. Franklin
loves Isaac Newton, too,

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:13.939
because Franklin is a
scientist. He believes that

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:16.865
there are laws of nature, of nature's God,

00:06:16.865 --> 00:06:19.687
and that there are certain
self evident truths,

00:06:19.687 --> 00:06:21.940
so he doesn't want the
word "sacred" in there

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.199
because that kind of
seems like divine right

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:26.466
of kings. God's the one
who made these truths.

00:06:26.466 --> 00:06:30.011
He's saying, "no." As
we've discussed that whole

00:06:30.011 --> 00:06:33.269
paragraph, it's about
rationality and reason

00:06:33.269 --> 00:06:35.160
getting us to those truths.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.836
Male 1: Right, but they
also do talk about,

00:06:36.836 --> 00:06:38.412
as we talked about previously,

00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:39.605
there's a balance here because

00:06:39.605 --> 00:06:40.866
they do talk about "created equal."

00:06:40.866 --> 00:06:42.829
Male 2: Well, let's look.
Tell us, what do you

00:06:42.829 --> 00:06:47.937
see there? This edit,
it says that they were

00:06:47.937 --> 00:06:52.484
had certain inherent and
inalienable rights. You see

00:06:52.484 --> 00:06:54.974
John Adams, and we're pretty sure that's

00:06:54.974 --> 00:06:57.080
John Adams' writing,
not just because of his

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.394
writing, but because of the concept.

00:06:59.394 --> 00:07:00.938
He was a little bit
more religious than the

00:07:00.938 --> 00:07:03.840
others on the committee. He says,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.481
"They're endowed by their
Creator." He puts in that phrase

00:07:07.481 --> 00:07:12.021
"by their Creator" with
certain inalienable rights.

00:07:12.021 --> 00:07:14.525
It's a balance. It's a balance between

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:17.527
rationality and reason,
which is self evident,

00:07:17.527 --> 00:07:22.454
and divine providence,
this notion that we're all

00:07:22.454 --> 00:07:25.998
children of the same Creator
and therefore we're all

00:07:25.998 --> 00:07:29.261
endowed with certain inalienable rights.

00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:32.012
Male 1: Yeah, this is
really amazing. Just to

00:07:32.012 --> 00:07:33.258
realize that they were human beings

00:07:33.258 --> 00:07:34.930
kind of forging through this.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.152
Male 2: Yeah, they're real
human beings who were probably

00:07:36.152 --> 00:07:39.203
arguing just like you.
Jefferson gets really upset

00:07:39.203 --> 00:07:41.534
at someone; not at Franklin
and Adams, but other

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:43.691
people start editing
it. Franklin tells them

00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:45.777
this wonderful story
about when he was a young

00:07:45.777 --> 00:07:47.934
tradesman in Philadelphia
and somebody had a sign

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.223
about selling hats and
everybody tried to edit

00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:52.561
the sign for them. Franklin
said, "That's why I've

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:56.176
never been on a committee
that's going to have

00:07:56.176 --> 00:07:59.203
a lot of people editing what I write."

00:07:59.203 --> 00:08:02.543
But, those of us who are
editors, we kind of think

00:08:02.543 --> 00:08:04.539
those edits actually improve the document.

00:08:04.539 --> 00:08:05.607
Male 1: Yeah, it seemed like it turned out

00:08:05.607 --> 00:08:06.236
a pretty good result.

00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:07.739
Male 2: You know, you
don't get much better than

00:08:07.739 --> 00:08:10.000
"We hold these truths to be self evident."
