Now, classical conditioning explains a lot of our behaviors. But only our

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.536
reflexive behaviors. Things such as salivation, and our startle response. So

00:00:09.536 --> 00:00:13.274
how do get the more complicated behaviors that we engage in? Well, we do so

00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:17.062
through what's called operant conditioning. Now, B.F Skinner started the field

00:00:17.062 --> 00:00:21.120
of operant conditioning. And he had the idea that we operate on our

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.935
environment. And our behavior is selected from the environment, meaning, if we

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.352
engaged in the behavior and something positive happens from that, we're likely

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:34.637
to do it again in the future. However, if we engage in a behavior and something

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:39.316
bad happens, we're less likely to do that again in the future. So with operant

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:42.696
conditioning, we have our large muscles in being involved instead of our just

00:00:42.696 --> 00:00:46.930
reflexive behaviors. Let's go into this in a little more detail.
