00:00:01.076 --> 00:00:03.112
In the last video we
explored when you pay a

00:00:03.112 --> 00:00:06.276
certain amount of money
on a per gallon basis

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:08.802
at the pump, how does that
break down who get what?

00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:11.530
How much of that goes to the gas station,

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.736
verses the transportation
network, verses the

00:00:13.736 --> 00:00:16.947
refineries, verses the
actual oil producers?

00:00:16.947 --> 00:00:19.139
The one thing I do want
to emphasis is I just

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:21.136
use that as kind of indicative numbers.

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:23.363
They can change widely
based on what's going

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:26.530
on in the market, and
where we are in the world.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.063
They are fairly
indicative. The other thing

00:00:28.063 --> 00:00:30.140
I want you to realize is that they aren't

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.609
always proportional.
It's not like that if oil

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.944
prices were to double
that this 15 cents that

00:00:34.944 --> 00:00:37.135
the retailer got would turn into 30 cents.

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:38.805
In general, regardless
of the price of oil,

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.808
at least in the United
States, the retailer

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.667
tends to get between
5 cents per gallon and

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.667
20 cents per gallon. It's normally in that

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.536
10 to 15 cent range.
Some of that has to be

00:00:48.536 --> 00:00:50.543
netted against the 5 cents or so that goes

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:53.443
for credit card processing. Taxes can be

00:00:53.443 --> 00:00:56.109
relatively fixed. It's
often on a per gallon basis.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.874
The spread that the refineries gets, it's

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:01.806
also not necessary
proportional to the price

00:01:01.806 --> 00:01:04.206
of oil. There are times
where the oil prices very

00:01:04.206 --> 00:01:06.202
high because their
might be a lot of excess

00:01:06.202 --> 00:01:07.948
capacities at the refineries.

00:01:07.948 --> 00:01:09.951
Their not able to charge a huge premium,

00:01:09.951 --> 00:01:11.809
or maybe their not able
to get a lot of the

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.618
other stuff. The refineries
might not be able

00:01:13.618 --> 00:01:17.286
to make much if anything
on each barrel of oil

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:19.207
that they actual refine. Sometimes it goes

00:01:19.207 --> 00:01:20.869
the other way around. A low price of oil,

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.140
if the refining capacity is really tight,

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.951
the refineries can raise the
price of the actual refined

00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.537
oil products. They can
raise more and more money.

00:01:31.537 --> 00:01:34.205
The players in this whole
supply chain that do,

00:01:34.205 --> 00:01:37.289
whose profits are a
function of the price of

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.837
oil are the oil producers.
Just to be clear,

00:01:39.837 --> 00:01:42.407
sometimes all of these
are owned by the same

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:44.038
company. That's what they
call these kind of vertically

00:01:44.038 --> 00:01:47.813
integrated oil producers.
Sometimes they are

00:01:47.813 --> 00:01:49.804
different players, and
when they are different

00:01:49.804 --> 00:01:51.870
players, the ones that
makes the most when oil

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.705
prices are high are the producers.

00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:57.135
These producers, they
invest huge amounts of

00:01:57.135 --> 00:02:00.621
money in exploration and then in drilling.

00:02:00.621 --> 00:02:02.618
They make some assumptions.
They say, "Hey, this

00:02:02.618 --> 00:02:04.802
oil rig that I'm going
to spend a hundred or

00:02:04.802 --> 00:02:06.470
two hundred million
dollars on, this is going

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.752
to be break even if oil
prices are say $30 a barrel."

00:02:10.752 --> 00:02:13.351
Obviously, if oil prices
end up being at $100 a

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:14.848
barrel, they're going to make a killing.

00:02:14.848 --> 00:02:17.256
They're going to make
$70 per barrel of profit.

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:18.529
This thing is going to
produce millions and

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:20.878
millions of barrels. On
the other hand, if oil

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:23.400
prices go down to $15
per barrel, they're going

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.516
to be killed. They're
going to take a huge loss

00:02:25.516 --> 00:02:27.732
on this huge investment they made.

00:02:27.732 --> 00:02:30.192
The one question I want
to at least attempt to

00:02:30.192 --> 00:02:31.726
address, and it's not a simple question.

00:02:31.726 --> 00:02:33.794
Many people devote their careers to this.

00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:38.692
What is actually dictating
the price of oil?

00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.998
We see it can't be just
the traditional supply

00:02:40.998 --> 00:02:43.990
and demand, or at least in
the short term it can't.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:47.528
If we look here at 2008.
In mid 2008 oil prices

00:02:47.528 --> 00:02:50.855
were pushing $150, and
then only a few months

00:02:50.855 --> 00:02:53.728
later they had collapsed to $32 a barrel.

00:02:53.728 --> 00:02:57.403
They had gone down by a factor of 5.

00:02:57.403 --> 00:02:59.060
There is something that happened here.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.463
The financial crisis
hit, obviously, peoples

00:03:01.463 --> 00:03:04.594
expectations of global
growth would have been

00:03:04.594 --> 00:03:07.126
gone down. The economy wouldn't grow.

00:03:07.126 --> 00:03:09.195
People might use a little
less energy, a little

00:03:09.195 --> 00:03:11.791
less fossil fuels, whatever. That wouldn't

00:03:11.791 --> 00:03:15.029
be enough to justify a
5 fold decrease in the

00:03:15.029 --> 00:03:17.410
price of oil. Something else is at play.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.662
As you can imagine, a lot
of it is just going to be

00:03:19.662 --> 00:03:22.084
the psychology of the crowd
right over here or the

00:03:22.084 --> 00:03:23.410
psychology of market.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.327
People were driving up the price of oil,

00:03:25.327 --> 00:03:27.590
and over here people freaked up, and they

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.860
started driving down the price of oil.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.080
To think about that in a
little bit more concrete terms.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.331
I mean think about the
price, or I'm going to

00:03:36.331 --> 00:03:38.752
think about the oil markets
in particular in the long term

00:03:38.752 --> 00:03:41.748
and short term, or the
long run and the short run.

00:03:41.748 --> 00:03:45.670
In the long run, let me draw the long run

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.338
right over here. In the
long run we can think of

00:03:48.338 --> 00:03:50.258
the oil markets like
you would think of any

00:03:50.258 --> 00:03:52.503
traditional microeconomic market.

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.413
Oil is entrusting because
it's a microeconomic.

00:03:55.413 --> 00:03:57.833
It's one good or service that has huge

00:03:57.833 --> 00:03:59.732
implementations on the macroeconomy on the

00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:03.133
growth of nations, how they
act, and whatever else.

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.063
We can think of it in kind of classical

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:08.338
microeconomic terms.
That's the price of oil.

00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:11.483
That's the quantity of
oil. You can imagine

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:14.405
that those first few
millions of barrels are

00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:16.740
fairly cheap to produce, and then every

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.270
incremental millions of barrels.

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:21.469
If you think about this,
this is the quantity

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:22.660
the millions of barrels per day.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.270
They have to go explore finding it harder

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.603
and harder places, using more and more

00:04:25.603 --> 00:04:27.531
technology to find it,
so the marginal cost

00:04:27.531 --> 00:04:30.076
of producing incremental barrels goes up.

00:04:30.076 --> 00:04:31.873
Another way of thinking
about this, at a low

00:04:31.873 --> 00:04:33.870
price, oil producers
say, "Hey, I'm going to

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.728
leave that oil in the
ground. Why should I pump

00:04:35.728 --> 00:04:38.406
it out and produce it
now? So there won't be a

00:04:38.406 --> 00:04:39.491
lot of quantity produce."

00:04:39.491 --> 00:04:40.903
At a higher price they're
like hey, we're going

00:04:40.903 --> 00:04:42.196
to pump as much as we
can. We're going to find

00:04:42.196 --> 00:04:44.579
that oil wherever it
is. We are going to pump

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:46.667
it and get it to the market.

00:04:46.667 --> 00:04:49.796
Two ways to interpret the
long run supply curve.

00:04:49.796 --> 00:04:51.799
Long run supply.

00:04:51.799 --> 00:04:53.578
The demand, also, we
can kind of view it in

00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:55.875
kind of a classical way.
Those first few millions

00:04:55.875 --> 00:04:58.998
of gallons, a huge
benefit to the consumers.

00:04:58.998 --> 00:05:01.665
There are some people
that maybe oil is the only

00:05:01.665 --> 00:05:03.602
thing they can use. They
can't go to any source

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:05.491
of energy. They get
huge benefits, but then

00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:07.415
the marginal benefit goes down for every

00:05:07.415 --> 00:05:11.001
incremental barrel of oil.

00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:14.412
Another way of thinking
about it, at high prices

00:05:14.412 --> 00:05:16.916
there aren't a lot of
people who are interested

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.539
in doing it. They
say,"Thank you. I'll just

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:20.334
go use something else.
I'll use solar power,

00:05:20.334 --> 00:05:21.866
I'll walk to work, or whatever else."

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:24.244
Then at low prices they
say, "Hey. I'm going

00:05:24.244 --> 00:05:27.075
to use all the oil I can
use. I'm going to drive

00:05:27.075 --> 00:05:30.327
my gas guzzler 100 miles to work. I'm just

00:05:30.327 --> 00:05:32.077
going to drive it around
the block for fun.

00:05:32.077 --> 00:05:33.906
I'm going to leave it
running, because I don't

00:05:33.906 --> 00:05:35.794
like to start my engine,
and all the rest."

00:05:35.794 --> 00:05:38.087
This kind of gives you a classical model

00:05:38.087 --> 00:05:41.199
downwards-sloping demand curve, and an

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:43.490
upward-sloping supply
curve. Then you would end up

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.930
with some equilibrium
price in the long run, and

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.908
some equilibrium quantity.

00:05:47.908 --> 00:05:52.572
This right over here
does not describe this

00:05:52.572 --> 00:05:55.660
all too well. Between
here and here you did

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.775
not have dramatic changes in
how people ... the amount of

00:05:59.775 --> 00:06:01.532
oil that supplied into the market.

00:06:01.532 --> 00:06:04.738
You did not have dramatic
changes in peoples

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:06.806
behavior in terms of how they consumed,

00:06:06.806 --> 00:06:09.015
or where they consumed
a lot or a little of it.

00:06:09.015 --> 00:06:12.681
One way to think about it
is this is the long run.

00:06:12.681 --> 00:06:15.199
Think about dynamics in
the long run, if there

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.769
is new technology to
find new oil to supply

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:20.531
curve could shift to the right like this.

00:06:20.531 --> 00:06:23.905
If for whatever reason
people start driving

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:26.015
electric cars, then the
demand curve could shift

00:06:26.015 --> 00:06:29.256
to the left like that.
If for whatever reason

00:06:29.256 --> 00:06:31.231
it became fashionable again for people to

00:06:31.231 --> 00:06:33.656
drive SUVs, the demand curve
could shift to the right.

00:06:33.656 --> 00:06:36.391
If countries economic
growth accelerates, if

00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:39.591
people in India and China
end up becoming wealthier

00:06:39.591 --> 00:06:42.395
and want to buy more
combustion automobiles,

00:06:42.395 --> 00:06:43.786
it could shift to the right.

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.808
In the long term you can
think about it in that way.

00:06:45.808 --> 00:06:48.319
If there's more drilling, if there's eases

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:50.515
regulation on drilling,
you could shift the supply

00:06:50.515 --> 00:06:52.457
curve to the right. If
you increase environmental

00:06:52.457 --> 00:06:54.597
regulations, supply curve
could shift to the left.

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:56.351
You could figure out the implications.

00:06:56.351 --> 00:07:00.054
That's not what's really
at play in the short run.

00:07:00.054 --> 00:07:01.938
When I think about the
short run, I'm not thinking

00:07:01.938 --> 00:07:03.929
about on a second-by-second
basis, the short

00:07:03.929 --> 00:07:05.766
run is really we're
thinking on over a period

00:07:05.766 --> 00:07:08.679
of months or even a small number of years.

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:11.926
That's because people aren't
changing their behavior

00:07:11.926 --> 00:07:14.463
dramatically on a month-to-month basis.

00:07:14.463 --> 00:07:15.763
They already bought their cars.

00:07:15.763 --> 00:07:17.460
They already bought
their gas-guzzling SUVs.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.993
Also, it not easy for
suppliers to turn capacity

00:07:19.993 --> 00:07:22.352
on or off in the very short run.

00:07:22.352 --> 00:07:25.124
In the short run our
model might look something

00:07:25.124 --> 00:07:26.861
like this. Obviously, these are gross over

00:07:26.861 --> 00:07:29.462
simplifications, but
they help us think about

00:07:29.462 --> 00:07:31.523
it a little bit. This is the quantity.

00:07:31.523 --> 00:07:34.395
This is price, so in the
short run, the quantity

00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:36.989
supplied is really not
going to be too sensitive

00:07:36.989 --> 00:07:40.023
to price. It might look
something like this.

00:07:40.023 --> 00:07:43.272
I'll just do it as a vertical
line just to really state

00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:44.994
how in the short offering,
over a of months,

00:07:44.994 --> 00:07:47.201
people are just going to pump
out the oil that they were

00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.535
planning on pumping on. Their
not going to shut wells.

00:07:48.535 --> 00:07:53.929
Their not going not use
their tankers or whatever

00:07:53.929 --> 00:07:55.206
else to transport their oil.

00:07:55.206 --> 00:07:57.001
Their going to produce,
and it's going to be

00:07:57.001 --> 00:07:58.669
transported to the market.

00:07:58.669 --> 00:08:01.506
This is the short run
supply curve, regardless

00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:04.400
of the price. In the long
run, if the prices go

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.535
down they might decided to
turn off capacity. If prices go

00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:10.753
up they might do more
expiration, open up more wells,

00:08:10.753 --> 00:08:13.322
but that takes time.
Often years to do that,

00:08:13.322 --> 00:08:15.393
especially if you start
from the expiration phase.

00:08:15.393 --> 00:08:17.869
This is supply not too sensitive to price.

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:20.124
Demand might look something like this.

00:08:20.124 --> 00:08:22.189
Once again this is one
way of thinking about it.

00:08:22.189 --> 00:08:25.258
A very simple model. Demand
might look something ...

00:08:25.258 --> 00:08:27.389
I'll do it in orange. Might look something

00:08:27.389 --> 00:08:33.120
like this. Where is
goes ... looks something

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.290
like that. The reason I
drew demand that like,

00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:37.921
is it kind of fits at
least people short term

00:08:37.921 --> 00:08:43.655
behavior. If our price
right now is right over

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:47.053
here, if it were to
pop-up right over there,

00:08:47.053 --> 00:08:48.994
in the short run, people
don't change their

00:08:48.994 --> 00:08:50.386
behavior that dramatically.
Their house and

00:08:50.386 --> 00:08:52.397
their work is the same distance.

00:08:52.397 --> 00:08:54.255
It's takes them a while
to start thinking about

00:08:54.255 --> 00:08:56.140
moving a little bit closer, changing jobs,

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.724
maybe getting a pass for
public transportation,

00:08:58.724 --> 00:09:01.371
or trading in their
gas-guzzling car for another

00:09:01.371 --> 00:09:03.522
car, or car pooling, or whatever else.

00:09:03.522 --> 00:09:05.209
If prices go down, the other way around.

00:09:05.209 --> 00:09:07.701
They might still have their Prius.

00:09:07.701 --> 00:09:10.722
They won't trade it in
for a more gas-guzzling

00:09:10.722 --> 00:09:14.053
car, et cetera, et cetera.
What this describes

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:18.059
is in the short run
the prices aren't being

00:09:18.059 --> 00:09:23.327
dictated by these classical
mircoeconomic inputs

00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:26.131
or factors in terms of supply and demand.

00:09:26.131 --> 00:09:28.522
What's really effecting
them in the short term

00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:32.389
is market psychology,
and this is why I put a

00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:36.221
little picture of Chicago Board of Trade.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.263
Which is where they
trade futures contracts.

00:09:38.263 --> 00:09:40.723
Futures contracts and
I've done video where I

00:09:40.723 --> 00:09:42.454
go into detail on what
futures contracts are.

00:09:42.454 --> 00:09:44.054
They are a way of trading commodities.

00:09:44.054 --> 00:09:46.324
Instead of people
walking around with vials

00:09:46.324 --> 00:09:48.323
or barrels of oil and
exchanging them, they say,

00:09:48.323 --> 00:09:51.388
"Here's a contract to
purchase oil from me in

00:09:51.388 --> 00:09:53.380
a month, or at a specific
date, or two months

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.653
at a specific date." People trade those.

00:09:55.653 --> 00:09:58.668
In the near term, what's
really driving the price

00:09:58.668 --> 00:10:01.796
of oil? What's really
causing these fluctuations

00:10:01.796 --> 00:10:03.927
right over here? That
can't really be described

00:10:03.927 --> 00:10:06.921
by all of these things,
is peoples psychology, and

00:10:06.921 --> 00:10:08.989
peoples information.
They look at things like

00:10:08.989 --> 00:10:12.185
the Middle East. They say, "Will Israel,

00:10:12.185 --> 00:10:14.186
Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israels Prime Minister,

00:10:14.186 --> 00:10:17.325
decide to preemptively
bomb Iran in an attempt

00:10:17.325 --> 00:10:20.057
to get rid of their
nuclear program. Will Iran

00:10:20.057 --> 00:10:22.467
do something crazy? How
would they retaliate?

00:10:22.467 --> 00:10:24.722
Would they try to close off
the straight of our moves?"

00:10:24.722 --> 00:10:27.218
Even if no one really
believes that is happening,

00:10:27.218 --> 00:10:28.596
some of them might say, Well someone else

00:10:28.596 --> 00:10:30.721
might believe it." They might
buy the futures contracts

00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.928
and then try to trade
it up, and other people,

00:10:32.928 --> 00:10:34.991
eventually, that oil has to be delivered,

00:10:34.991 --> 00:10:36.852
they might take deliver
of that oil but not

00:10:36.852 --> 00:10:38.590
bring it to market. They
might hoard it in some

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.986
way, because they believe
that somethings going to

00:10:40.986 --> 00:10:43.251
happen and oil is going
to be scarce at some

00:10:43.251 --> 00:10:44.889
point in the future.

00:10:44.889 --> 00:10:46.987
The big take away is
all of these things, the

00:10:46.987 --> 00:10:50.808
production of oil,
other sources of energy,

00:10:50.808 --> 00:10:52.920
peoples behavior, they
do matter in the long

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.168
run on the price of oil. In the short run,

00:10:55.168 --> 00:10:56.926
we're talking about the
order of 6 months to

00:10:56.926 --> 00:10:59.657
over a year. It really
is market psychology.

00:10:59.657 --> 00:11:02.641
Some of these geopolitical
events that might

00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:06.470
effect market psychology
that's causing these

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.367
wild swings in the price of oil.
