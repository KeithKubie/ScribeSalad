00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.070
Good evening, everybody.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.960
I'm Homi Bhaba, director of
the Mahindra Humanities Center,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.510
and I'm absolutely
delighted to welcome you

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:20.480
to the launch of the second
year of our environment forum.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.220
Last year's wide array
of events, including

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.860
visits by Terry Tempest
Williams, Jedediah Purdy, Roy

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.000
Scranton, Timothy LeCain,
Tiya Miles, and it's

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.970
an honor for us to have
our colleague Naomi

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.330
Oreskes to lead off this fall.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.410
Before Robin Kelsey
introduces Professor Oreskes,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.040
I wanted to share a few
thoughts on the series

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.510
and its importance for us
at the Mahindra Center.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.000
The forum is our attempt to
establish platforms that deal

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.940
with areas of study and public
interests that do not fall

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.410
within the remit of
any one discipline,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.520
and that we cannot simply in a
facile way designate as being

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.720
interdisciplinary.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.350
The fine granularity
of these problems

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.750
often emerges in the spaces
in between established bodies

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.440
of knowledge.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.250
And this is something that
we're very keen on fostering

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.900
and exploring at the
Humanities Center,

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.710
these forms of
interstitial knowledge

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.730
that question the boundaries
of several disciplinary

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.620
configurations.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.540
And out of them
emerge challenges

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.930
where we've got to find a
kind of montage of methods

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.310
in order to gain some
purchase or perspective.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.990
And the environment forum
really helps us to do this.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.970
You have people who write in
the first person about processes

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.050
that are so much larger than any
first person narrative can ever

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.370
contain.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.060
So there's this
remarkable energy

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.030
between specifying something
that has not been named

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.420
and putting around it several
dynamics of knowledge,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.990
subjectification, questions
of value, and so on.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.900
So it's this kind
of interstitial area

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.090
for which we really
thank our conveners

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.850
of the environmental forum.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:41.600
And I say this because it's been
my growing sense of what we do

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.320
here at the environment forum.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.420
Working with these
interstitial spaces

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:55.040
redefines the relationship
between pedagogical interest

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.300
and political action.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.170
So it's not simply
that we're dealing

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.630
with a certain way in which
new knowledge is formed,

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.970
but it restructures the
articulation of education

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.720
and practice and the form
of political calculation

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.160
and judgment.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.230
The study of the
environment presents us

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.110
with the challenge
of having to secure

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.600
a language of description that
finds its network, its voice,

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.480
in a continually circulating
network of dialogues.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.580
The dominant motif
of these events

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.810
has been the profound issue
of the care of the planet,

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.460
[INAUDIBLE],, a form of care
that Heidegger, amongst others,

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.710
has elaborated in being in time.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.980
Care as a form of ethical
attention and vigilant

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.570
interpretation is at the
very core of the project

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:57.490
of the humanities.

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:00.550
And to the extent to
which an ethic of care

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.560
is fundamental to the
survival of planetary life,

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.860
the environment
forum is at the core

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.060
of the work of the
Mahindra Center.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.040
I don't think that
there has ever

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:22.730
been a time which has made
this whole question of care

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:29.270
as an ethical, but also as
a careful textual project

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.850
more urgent or apparent.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.820
There is such a
widespread carelessness

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.700
of the lives of the
people, a carelessness

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.820
towards the planet, a
carelessness towards truth,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.960
a carelessness
towards interpretation

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:53.870
coupled in the last months
with remarkable ecological and

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.300
environmental crises.

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.040
It's almost as if nature
is standing up and saying,

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.900
we cannot have this any longer.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.550
And in these crises,
what becomes visible

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.170
are the great deficits
of planetary care,

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:24.790
but also the great deficits
of citizenly carefulness.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.190
And it is in that
spirit that I'm

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.230
very happy to welcome
you to the launch

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.620
event of the second year
of the environment forum,

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.430
and I want to thank my dear
friends and colleagues Robin

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.450
Kelsey and Ian
Miller for helping

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.364
us to build this argument.

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:44.846
Thank you.

00:05:44.846 --> 00:05:47.810
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.140
I'm Robin Kelsey, dean
of Arts and Humanities,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.070
And with Ian Miller a
co-convener of the environment

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.430
forum, the mission
of which has just

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.000
been articulated with
unprecedented eloquence

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.570
by Homi Bhaba.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.790
And I want to thank Homi for
embracing the environment

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.180
forum, for coming
to these events,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.590
for thinking hard
about this project,

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:28.350
and for on this occasion
such a brilliant articulation

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.260
of what we are about.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:36.540
I also want to thank Steve
Biel and Sarah Razor, who have

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.101
done so much to bring this on.

00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:39.600
Yes.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:48.260
[APPLAUSE] I am convinced there
is more than one Sarah Razor,

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.010
but she always
looks much the same.

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:58.830
So this university, 391
years old and counting,

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:04.960
has a motto that consists
of a single word, veritas.

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.610
Harvard presumably
pursues many values,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:14.230
but the isolation in our
motto of this one value,

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.730
truth, implicitly
acknowledges how easy

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:23.080
it would be to muddy
our own waters,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.400
to lose our sense of
direction and purpose,

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.810
to drift down some easier path.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:37.890
The Harvard motto I think
rightly understood tacitly

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:40.380
recognizes that the
pursuit of truth

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.240
requires grit and courage
as well as curiosity.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.570
And no one at Harvard
exemplifies this combination

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:52.680
of qualities better
than Naomi Oreskes.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.960
Professor of the history
of science at Harvard

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.090
as well as an
affiliate of the earth

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:59.730
and planetary sciences,
Professor Oreskes

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:05.040
has, by virtue of her gritty
and courageous pursuit of truth,

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.290
become a crucial agent of
our collective conscience.

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:13.630
Along with her frequent
co-author Eric Conway,

00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:19.230
a historian at the Jet
Propulsion Lab at Caltech,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:23.040
Professor Oreskes has clarified
the state of our knowledge

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.280
about human-induced
climate change,

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.250
exposed the hidden
apparatus that

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:33.570
obfuscates and misrepresents
that knowledge,

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:36.870
and has offered a
bleak but all too sober

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.700
assessment of where our
carelessness, to use

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:47.460
Homi's term, may lead
our planet and ourselves.

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.840
With respect to climate
change, in other words,

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.230
if we have any grasp
of where things stand

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.620
and the challenges
we face, we owe it

00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:00.940
in no small part to
Professor Oreskes.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.360
A holder of a BS degree from
the Royal School of Mines--

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.510
I did not know this
actually before I started

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.810
preparing this introduction.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.900
I found that an absolutely
delightful piece

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:11.770
of information.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:15.340
A holder of a BS degree from the
Royal School of Mines Imperial

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.850
College of London, and a
PhD from Stanford, Professor

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.950
Oreskes is the author or
co-author of several books,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.410
and a common thread
running through them

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:29.170
is an insistence
on understanding

00:09:29.170 --> 00:09:32.880
how the production of
knowledge and the contestation

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:36.700
that that production
entails actually happens.

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.300
Along with other leading
historians of science,

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:45.230
she has countered a
longstanding tendency

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:50.480
to confuse the justification
for scientific theories

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:54.380
with the histories by which
those theories have obtained

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.020
their scientific standing.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.380
In her first book, The Rejection
of Continental Drift, Theory

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:04.020
and Method in American
Earth Science,

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:07.550
She argues convincingly
that a significant portion

00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:11.660
of this confusion stems from
an excessively monolithic

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.870
understanding of the
scientific method.

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:19.040
Indeed, she demonstrates
that American geoscientists

00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:23.210
were so resistant to the
theory of continental drift

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:26.750
precisely because it
challenged the way that they

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:28.700
went about their work.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.370
It's a wonderful
piece of scholarship

00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:33.290
in the history of science.

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.770
Working with Conway,
Professor Oreskes

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:41.720
produced the 2010 book
Merchants of Doubt,

00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:46.220
a phrase that has entered
the lexicon of many of us.

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:49.280
A book that demonstrated that
a small number of scientists

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.090
with strong ties to industry
and to industry-friendly parts

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:59.870
of our political establishment
have over decades served

00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:04.220
to obscure scientific
consensus and sew

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.620
doubts in the populace
at large about

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:09.950
robust scientific inferences.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.910
The coterie of experts,
scientists of high standing

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.750
who have, however, no
particular expertise

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:21.560
in the matter in question,
has time and again slowed

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:25.760
political recognition of a
range of dangerous practices

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.040
from cigarette smoking
to fossil fuel burning.

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.010
And as we experience the
onset of post-truth politics,

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.840
Merchants of Doubt is
more important than ever.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.270
And I'm very much
looking forward

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:44.300
to seeing how this segue
is made this evening.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:47.120
More recently,
Oreskes and Conway

00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.550
wrote The Collapse of
Western Civilization, a View

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:52.550
From the Future, a work
of speculative fiction

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:56.360
that makes vivid the possible
costs of our ongoing failure

00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:59.750
to address our climate problem.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.760
And I know Ian uses
this in his teaching

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.230
and has wonderful
stories to tell

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.890
about how generative it is.

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:09.170
In addition to her
books, Professor Oreskes

00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:12.140
has produced numerous articles
both in scholarly journals

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.540
and the popular press.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:19.190
She is a public intellectual
of the most necessary kind,

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:23.690
and she is here this evening to
talk to us about giant power.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:25.790
A giant power herself,
please join me

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:27.588
in welcoming Naomi Oreskes.

00:12:27.588 --> 00:12:30.576
[APPLAUSE]

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:43.130
Thank you very much for
that incredibly generous

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.090
introduction.

00:12:44.090 --> 00:12:46.473
But as you can see,
I'm not giant at all.

00:12:46.473 --> 00:12:48.320
[LAUGHTER] But on
the other hand, I did

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.440
pick up some grit at the
Royal School of Mines.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:56.630
So it's really a pleasure to be
here and see so many new faces.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:58.640
And also it's great
to be introduced

00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:03.050
as a poster child
for interstitiality

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:05.687
because earlier in my career I
was just considered a problem.

00:13:05.687 --> 00:13:07.520
You know, deans didn't
know where to put me.

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.520
One dean once told me I
had the strangest resume

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:10.790
he'd ever seen.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.410
So it's actually
incredibly gratifying

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:17.360
to feel that the world has kind
of come around to my vision.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.930
So thank you very much.

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.640
I'm feeling very
satisfied tonight.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.890
Of course, that's a bad thing.

00:13:21.890 --> 00:13:23.431
You should never
feel self-satisfied.

00:13:23.431 --> 00:13:25.350
So with that, we get to work.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.010
So many of you are familiar
with the comedian John Oliver.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:29.970
And some of you may
have seen the routine

00:13:29.970 --> 00:13:32.750
he did a few months back
where he got really vexed

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.600
about the fact that many
Americans don't accept

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.400
the reality of climate change.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.560
And he noted that
one in four Americans

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.920
are skeptical-- or is
skeptical-- about climate

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.420
change.

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:44.720
And he said, "who gives a shit?

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.930
That doesn't matter.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.420
You don't need people's
opinion on a fact.

00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.530
You might as well have a poll
asking which number is bigger,

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.780
5 or 15?

00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.790
Do owls exist?

00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:59.030
Or are there hats?"

00:13:59.030 --> 00:14:02.630
Now although I love John Oliver,
unfortunately as a historian

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.480
I have to acknowledge that there
is, in fact, a long history

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.020
of arguing about whether
there are hats, so to speak,

00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.320
and of trying to persuade
the American people that five

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.650
actually might be a
bigger number than 15.

00:14:15.650 --> 00:14:17.660
So just to give you one
example out of my work

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.290
on the history of
climate change,

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:21.960
Oliver was of course
referring to climate change,

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:24.980
and in particular he has
gone on several rants

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.840
about the recent
claim that many of us

00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:30.410
heard repeatedly during the
last election, the claim

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.100
that global warming
had stopped in 1998.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:36.670
Now, these are the actual
historic temperature records

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:38.500
going back to 1880.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.410
But one thing we know
is that you can actually

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:44.440
get people to think about
numbers in very different ways

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.810
simply by the way
you present them.

00:14:46.810 --> 00:14:49.120
So for example, my
colleague Steve Lewandowski

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.997
did an extremely interesting
experiment a few years ago.

00:14:51.997 --> 00:14:53.580
These are the global
temperature data,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.880
again, going back to 1880,
plotted in this graph showing

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:00.870
a five year running mean.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:04.450
But he labeled it world
agricultural output.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:09.910
And he asked people this,
what is the trend since 1998?

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.770
And they all answered that
output continued to rise,

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:14.670
which is the correct answer.

00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:16.500
But if you show
them this graph, you

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:18.160
get a very different answer.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:20.100
This is what we call
the skeptic's graph

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.460
of global warming.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:25.320
If you show them this, people
will tell you they don't know

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.240
or the temperatures didn't rise.

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:30.180
So this presentation is used
by many climate change skeptics

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:32.160
and deniers to confuse
people about what's

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:37.800
actually happening with the
numbers, 5 and 15, or 1 and 2.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.990
Put more generally,
we have ample evidence

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:43.050
that it's actually pretty easy
to get people arguing about

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:44.980
whether or not there are hats.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.130
Now, how do you
get people to argue

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:49.260
about the existence
of hats is largely

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.540
a social scientific question.

00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:54.420
But why people have
done so and for what

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:57.480
purposes I want to argue
is primarily a question

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:59.280
of history and culture.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:03.090
And so today I want to
talk about the new work

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:06.477
I'm doing on the history of
disinformation long duree.

00:16:06.477 --> 00:16:09.060
And I was hoping David Armitage
was here so that I could boast

00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.830
about doing long duree history.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.080
But in any event--

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:16.267
and to talk about it
specifically in the relation

00:16:16.267 --> 00:16:18.600
to the question of the defense
of free market capitalism

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.622
in the United States.

00:16:19.622 --> 00:16:22.080
Because it turns out that these
two things are very closely

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.865
related.

00:16:22.865 --> 00:16:24.240
So I'm going to
talk to you today

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.090
about a new project
that I call Inventing

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.160
the Magic of the Marketplace.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:32.910
We could also call it the long
history of post-facticity.

00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:35.220
I'm particularly interested
in post-facticity

00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:36.882
in the private sector.

00:16:36.882 --> 00:16:39.090
That is to say I'm not that
interested in the history

00:16:39.090 --> 00:16:43.050
of politicians lying, I
think that's pretty familiar.

00:16:43.050 --> 00:16:45.900
But there's a different history
that I think is extremely

00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:49.050
important of actors in the
private sector-- businessmen,

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.416
PR, advertising
companies, think tanks--

00:16:52.416 --> 00:16:53.790
who have been
involved in this it

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:56.680
turns out for a very long time.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:58.920
So some initial observations.

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.260
This pattern of private
sector disinformation

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.430
is repeatedly linked to two
key and interrelated aims.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.160
One is to stop or
limit regulation

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:12.030
of particular industries such
as electricity or tobacco,

00:17:12.030 --> 00:17:14.790
and the other is to
protect the private sector

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:18.450
from responsibility for
external costs of their products

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:22.500
like air pollution, water
pollution, climate change.

00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.390
But the defense of
the private sector

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:26.220
through propaganda
and disinformation

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:29.100
has repeatedly involved
tropes of freedom

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:32.220
and the American way of life,
and has been repeatedly linked

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:34.710
to the defense of
laissez faire capitalism

00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:36.240
in the early 20th century--

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.850
or what we tend to call
neoliberalism later--

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.960
and the repeated argument
that the American way of life

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.140
is inextricably bound to
enterprise capitalism.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.060
So this is a cultural
question, and so that's

00:17:48.060 --> 00:17:50.670
one reason why I was keen to
give this talk here tonight

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.800
at the Humanities Center.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.500
Now, Robin already referred
to my work with Erik Conway.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:59.760
In Merchants of Doubt, we showed
how this argument about freedom

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.950
and the American way of
life was developed and honed

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:05.340
by the tobacco industry, and
then how a group of actors

00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.190
applied these arguments
to a set of issues

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:11.340
in the late 20th century,
including acid rain, the ozone

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:16.830
hole, the regulation of DDT,
and of course, climate change.

00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:19.350
We identified a specific
strategy which we saw

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.530
used repeatedly, to
cast doubt on facts

00:18:22.530 --> 00:18:25.170
that show the harms
of your product,

00:18:25.170 --> 00:18:27.960
insist that the
science is unsettled,

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:30.660
to recruit experts to give
your otherwise obviously

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.570
self-interested
position credibility,

00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:35.880
to impugn the motives
of your opponents,

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.360
and to assert that their actions
threaten American freedom,

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.640
hence the use of the
term watermelons,

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:46.750
that they're green on the
outside but red on the inside.

00:18:46.750 --> 00:18:49.020
So in our research, we
traced these arguments

00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:51.510
from current and recent
debates about climate change

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:53.454
back to the tobacco industry.

00:18:53.454 --> 00:18:54.870
And we showed
through our research

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.240
how the same think
tanks, the same PR

00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.170
firms, the same advertising
agencies, and sometimes

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:03.540
even the same
people were involved

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:06.360
in attacking the science
showing the harms of tobacco

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:08.580
and the science showing
the harms of fossil fuel

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.170
combustion.

00:19:10.170 --> 00:19:12.990
And we showed how they linked
the defense of harmful products

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.870
to the defense of free market
capitalism, and from there

00:19:15.870 --> 00:19:18.440
to the defense of
freedom generally.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:21.090
So just to give one example,
this is one of my favorite ones

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:24.180
from a report defending
the tobacco industry

00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:27.900
and attacking the science
related to secondhand smoke.

00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.260
The scientists who
wrote this piece, one

00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:34.290
of our merchants of doubt,
actually laid it on the line

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:36.570
and he wrote, quote,
"if we do not carefully

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.750
delineate the government's
role in regulating dangers,

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:41.430
there's essentially
no limit to how much

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.197
government can ultimately
control our lives."

00:19:44.197 --> 00:19:45.780
So there's the
argument in a nutshell,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.390
and people often ask me,
well, are these people

00:19:48.390 --> 00:19:49.546
just shills for industry?

00:19:49.546 --> 00:19:50.670
How do they sleep at night?

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:52.730
How do they understand
what they're doing?

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:53.990
It's a complicated story.

00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:55.870
The answer is not the
same for everyone.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:58.350
But I think this
argument helps to explain

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:00.060
how people can take
these positions

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:01.500
and view them as principled.

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.910
But although it may be
principled for an individual,

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:10.890
it gets used in an
extremely unprincipled way.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:13.610
So I thought I would just show
you a small clip from our film,

00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:15.500
from the film version
of Merchants of Doubt,

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.110
because I'm an extremely
lucky academic.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.340
If you don't read my book,
I can show you the movie.

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.720
So I'm going to just show
you a clip that really shows

00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:27.440
how this argument about freedom
was exploited by the tobacco

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.630
industry, and then
we'll move on to looking

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:32.304
at this longer older history.

00:20:32.304 --> 00:20:35.286
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.000
- The tobacco
companies knew you have

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.520
to appeal to
something more basic

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.350
than this intellectual
pursuit of science.

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.270
And how do you do it?

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:56.500
You do it with freedom.

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.012
- That's the way freedom dies.

00:20:58.012 --> 00:21:01.600
Today it's smoking, but what
will they try to regulate next?

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:03.250
- What will they try
to regulate next?

00:21:03.250 --> 00:21:05.592
What we can say,
what we can read?

00:21:05.592 --> 00:21:07.300
- I don't want Big
Brother breathing down

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.080
my neck telling me what to do.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.400
- Not just for the smokers, but
for non-smokers and all others

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.490
in this country who want to live
their lives making their own

00:21:15.490 --> 00:21:18.910
decisions not having them made
for them by the benevolent

00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:21.880
bureaucracy of Washington
wisdom or these other folks--

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:25.090
- By turning it into an
abstract issue of freedom

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:26.860
and moving it away
from protecting

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.330
their corporate interests,
they can get people behind it.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:32.530
I mean, who's could
possibly be against freedom?

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.170
And then what happened
was these other companies

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:36.910
in other industries
realized, like,

00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.160
hey, that's a pretty good idea.

00:21:45.110 --> 00:21:46.570
- Everywhere you
turn, somebody's

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:48.930
telling us what we can't eat.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:50.560
Do you ever feel
like you're always

00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.835
being told what not to do?

00:21:52.835 --> 00:21:54.460
- These are people
that want to tell us

00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:57.010
where to work, how many
children we can have,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.590
how much energy we can use,
how much water we can have--

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:01.390
- Looking at the
global warming issue,

00:22:01.390 --> 00:22:03.820
you're seeing the
same thing happening.

00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.670
- For literally
decades, David Koch

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.950
has been just a
tireless defender

00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:11.314
of our economic and
individual freedoms.

00:22:11.314 --> 00:22:12.730
I'd like to introduce
to you David

00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.975
Koch, our chairman at the
Americans for Prosperity.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.330
- Koch industries
is heavily invested

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:26.860
in coal, oil, tar sands.

00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:30.200
They are some of the biggest
polluters in the country,

00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.210
have received some
of the largest fines.

00:22:34.210 --> 00:22:38.380
- They needed an army of people
to fight against regulation

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.900
in the name of freedom.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:44.330
- Good afternoon,
fellow freedom fighters!

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.320
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.854
OK, so you get the picture.

00:22:46.854 --> 00:22:49.020
So this is Americans for
Prosperity, otherwise known

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.160
as the Tea Party.

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:52.570
And the motif, the
repeated motif is,

00:22:52.570 --> 00:22:54.420
this is about freedom.

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:56.850
So today what I
want to talk about

00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.600
is my new work that begins
to extend this analysis.

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:03.360
And I want to say,
Erik Conway and I

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.220
were pretty excited
when we realized

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.370
that we could trace
climate change now back

00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:08.370
to the tobacco industry.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:11.130
We thought that was,
like, pretty amazing.

00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:13.222
And I should have
realized as a historian

00:23:13.222 --> 00:23:15.180
that if you look deeper,
though, you can always

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:17.190
find the earlier antecedents.

00:23:17.190 --> 00:23:19.550
So that's really what
this work is today,

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.080
to look at some even
earlier antecedents.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.870
So I want to begin by talking
about an advertising campaign

00:23:24.870 --> 00:23:28.800
from the 1960s that warned
of a grave impending threat

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.760
to American freedom.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.200
So one advertisement shown
here asked the question,

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.510
how is freedom lost?

00:23:36.510 --> 00:23:39.120
Another answered the
question, freedom

00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:41.610
is not lost by guns alone.

00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:45.450
And you can see this is the
Berlin Wall here being shown.

00:23:45.450 --> 00:23:48.990
Another ad asked, will
you leave these freedoms

00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:50.160
to your children?

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.580
And it identified four key
freedoms symbolized here

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:56.940
by a Bible, a key, a
pencil, and the ballot.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:00.000
The Bible representing, of
course, freedom of religion,

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.940
the key representing
the right to privacy,

00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.000
the pencil representing
the right to free speech

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.300
and free expression, and the
ballot representing the right

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:11.860
to democratic governance.

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:14.980
And this advertisement
told us that half the world

00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.350
is trying to destroy
these four symbols

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.750
and what they stand for.

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:22.297
So what were these
advertisements for?

00:24:22.297 --> 00:24:24.130
Well if you hadn't seen
the title of my talk

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:25.780
you might think--

00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:28.990
or maybe even still think
a political party, maybe

00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:32.440
Barry Goldwater; an
anti-communist group, maybe

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.080
the John Birch Society;
maybe a campaign

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.150
against the campaign
for nuclear disarmament;

00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:39.040
maybe an American church.

00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:42.980
But the answer is electricity.

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.840
This was an advertising campaign
defending electricity generated

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.780
in the private sector
against electricity generated

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:55.730
in municipally owned utilities
or federal power generation

00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:56.790
schemes.

00:24:56.790 --> 00:24:59.520
And the argument had
two major components.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.240
The first was ostensibly
a factual claim.

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:04.370
It was the claim that
government run electricity

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.550
was more expensive than
private sector electricity.

00:25:07.550 --> 00:25:09.710
And therefore, it was not
in the public interest

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:13.370
to have publicly-funded or
publicly-managed electricity

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:15.060
products.

00:25:15.060 --> 00:25:17.600
So for example
this ad asked, how

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.300
can we save taxpayers
half a billion dollars?

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.110
The answer, don't build
federal hydropower projects.

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:26.570
This ad informed us that
American families paid over

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:30.050
$5 trillion a year to
support public power.

00:25:30.050 --> 00:25:31.920
And at the bottom, it
may be cut off there,

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.360
but it said in capital letters,
when public power wins,

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.890
you lose.

00:25:37.890 --> 00:25:40.530
But the advertisement
was also ideological.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.610
It wasn't just about the cost
of federal hydroelectric dams

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:45.970
or other things like that.

00:25:45.970 --> 00:25:48.540
It was also the argument that
government-run electricity

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:51.330
was a threat to American
freedom and democracy.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:53.430
So again, if we go
back to this ad,

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:56.400
we already talked about the
idea of these key freedoms.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.430
And some ads join these
two themes together.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:01.502
So this is my favorite one.

00:26:01.502 --> 00:26:03.210
This one tells us that
there are actually

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:04.906
two kinds of electricity.

00:26:04.906 --> 00:26:06.780
You might not know that
from your light bulb,

00:26:06.780 --> 00:26:08.929
because you wouldn't be
able to see the difference.

00:26:08.929 --> 00:26:10.470
But actually there's
a big difference

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.930
between electricity
from an electric company

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.720
versus the electricity
from the government.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.870
Company electricity is better
than government electricity

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:23.010
because it's cheaper, because it
pays taxes rather than imposing

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:25.110
them, because it's
available to everyone

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:28.530
without discrimination, and
most importantly because it

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:31.770
plays a key role in America's
free enterprise system.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:34.110
And I love this advertisement
because the pretty woman

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:37.500
represents the private sector
and this dumbfounded man

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:41.480
represents the government.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.640
One interesting thing
about these advertisements

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:45.530
is that they inverted
conventional notions

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:49.730
of public and private, referring
to privately held shareholder

00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:53.510
owned companies as public, but
putting public in scare quotes

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.780
and claiming that public power
wasn't actually public at all,

00:26:56.780 --> 00:26:58.740
it was government power.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:01.040
So there's a kind of
jujitsu move here.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.290
The private sector is
equated with the public,

00:27:03.290 --> 00:27:06.980
as in British public
schools, but public powers

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:09.980
asserted not actually to be in
the hands of the public at all,

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:14.520
but an interfering, incompetent,
and wasteful government.

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.060
The key argument is that by
interfering in the marketplace,

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.430
the government is threatening
our private property

00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.970
and personal freedom, as
well as wasting our money.

00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.070
Now, these ads
were from the 1960s

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:29.240
but the same argument had
made before in the 1920s

00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:32.150
by an organization known as
NELA, the National Electric

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:34.940
Light Association.

00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.300
By the 1960s, many Americans
had forgotten about this earlier

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.600
campaign, but it essentially
took the same form.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:44.480
Public power's more
expensive, public power's

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:46.790
a threat to freedom, it's
unsound, socialistic,

00:27:46.790 --> 00:27:50.600
and fundamentally un-American,
and anyone who advocates it

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.360
must be a socialist or worse.

00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:55.250
So who were NELA?

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:59.120
NELA was a trade organization
first established in the 1880s

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.220
but expanded and strengthened
under the influence

00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:03.395
of the Chicago
industrialist Thomas Insull,

00:28:03.395 --> 00:28:05.270
who was one of the
leaders in the development

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:08.380
of electrification of
the city of Chicago.

00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.420
NELA represented the
holding companies

00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.650
that in the late 19th
and early 20th century

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:16.310
owned most local private
electricity utilities.

00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.980
In the 1930s they were
investigated by the Federal

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:21.920
Trade Commission in a series
of investigations that led

00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.310
to about 30 volumes of reports.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:29.150
The FTC found that NELA had
organized a massive propaganda

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.150
campaign designed to discredit
municipal electricity

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:35.550
and impugn the motives of
those who supported it.

00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.950
They concluded that holding
companies had, in fact, been

00:28:37.950 --> 00:28:40.920
engaged in many speculative
financial activities

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.960
and were a major source
of political corruption.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.960
Now in hindsight, many
of these activities

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.720
are actually very similar to
the things for which the tobacco

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.630
industry was prosecuted
under the Rico statutes,

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.570
but Rico had not yet
been passed as a law.

00:28:54.570 --> 00:28:57.330
So they couldn't be prosecuted
for most of these activities.

00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:00.180
There was no law that
made these things illegal,

00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:03.409
but they were greatly
constrained after 1935

00:29:03.409 --> 00:29:04.950
by the passage of
the Holding Company

00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:10.450
Act, which interestingly
enough was repealed in 2005.

00:29:10.450 --> 00:29:13.000
Now in hindsight, historians
who have studied this episode

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.580
have concluded that the central
claims that NELA put forward

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:17.710
were factually untrue.

00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:21.800
That, in fact, private power
was generally more costly

00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:24.460
and that this was known
and documented at the time,

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:27.400
and that public power, when it
was implemented under the New

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:30.790
Deal in rural electrification in
the Tennessee Valley Authority,

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.890
well, the federal
government did grow,

00:29:32.890 --> 00:29:35.380
but the United States did
not become communistic.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:37.730
Although some people
might argue that point.

00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.280
So here's an
interesting question.

00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.200
Why did the electricity
industry think

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.060
they needed this
propaganda campaign?

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:45.700
Well, there were
three main issues

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.540
that were motivating them.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:50.740
One was the problem of
rural electrification,

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:52.240
the second was the
problem of what

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.540
constituted a reasonable
rate for electricity,

00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:57.040
and the third were
these allegations

00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.760
of questionable practices.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.305
So as many of you probably
know, power generation

00:30:02.305 --> 00:30:05.140
in the United States was mainly
developed as a private sector

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.530
activity which contrasted
to other countries

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.750
like Germany, France,
Japan, and New

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.580
Zealand, where the government
was much more involved.

00:30:13.580 --> 00:30:17.360
It was a huge success in urban
areas like New York, Chicago,

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:18.400
and St. Louis.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.620
The private sector was
very effective in bringing

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:24.700
electricity to citizens
in major urban areas.

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.740
But rural areas of
America remained

00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:30.181
largely underserved, or in some
cases, completely unserved.

00:30:30.181 --> 00:30:31.930
And where they were
served they were often

00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.660
too expensive for rural
citizens, particularly farmers,

00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.087
to afford.

00:30:36.087 --> 00:30:38.170
And the fact that it was
too expensive for farmers

00:30:38.170 --> 00:30:41.230
became a topic of conversation
because many people

00:30:41.230 --> 00:30:43.990
argued that while it was all
very well and good to light up

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:47.830
the Empire State Building
or have lighting displays

00:30:47.830 --> 00:30:49.330
at the St. Louis
World's Fair, it

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:53.710
was farmers who really needed
electricity for the hard work

00:30:53.710 --> 00:30:57.350
that they did on their farms.

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.560
So in response to this lack
of electricity in rural areas,

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:02.456
some farmers developed
cooperatives,

00:31:02.456 --> 00:31:03.830
and there was
increasing pressure

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:06.800
for the federal government to
become involved in electricity.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.930
And indeed, there were a
couple of major projects

00:31:08.930 --> 00:31:11.930
such as the Muscle Shoals
project, which historians have

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:14.720
written a lot about, the
Hoover Dam, and ultimately

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.870
the Tennessee Valley Authority
and rural electrification,

00:31:17.870 --> 00:31:20.210
although that came later.

00:31:20.210 --> 00:31:22.640
The second was the issue
of reasonable rates.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.470
Electricity was
widely recognized

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:27.557
as being what was known at that
time as a natural monopoly.

00:31:27.557 --> 00:31:30.140
That is to say, an industry in
which competition didn't really

00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.080
make sense because it would
be wasteful and impractical

00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.420
to have multiple
electricity lines running

00:31:35.420 --> 00:31:37.550
through a city or a rural area.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:39.380
So companies were
given franchises

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:42.560
that were regulated by state
commissions on the same model

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.300
as the railroads,
which were also

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:46.610
viewed as natural monopolies.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.860
The commissions would
set what were known to be

00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:51.290
or thought to be
reasonable and fair rates,

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:54.810
and that was based on the idea
of a reasonable rate of return,

00:31:54.810 --> 00:31:58.370
which was generally
thought to be 5% to 6%.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:31:59.960
But there was
considerable evidence

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:03.290
that companies were overcharging
and actually garnering

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:06.020
returns of 7%,
8%, or 9%, in part

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:08.330
by exaggerating
their operating costs

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:11.950
and using this to
justify higher rates.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:15.510
In fact, there was evidence that
public electricity was cheaper,

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:18.300
and the prime case was
Ontario Hydro Power.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.780
In Canada, Ontario had
developed a system of hydropower

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.270
that was publicly owned
and it had broad power

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.480
to most residents of
Ontario at much lower cost

00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.810
than across the border in New
York City or Pennsylvania.

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:34.470
So very similar
cultural situation.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:36.840
Electricity was much more
widely available in Ontario

00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:39.210
and cheaper than it
was in upstate New York

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.650
or Pennsylvania.

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.630
And this was used
as evidence that, A,

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:45.000
the industry was
charging too much, and B,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.080
that public generation might
be more cost effective.

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.260
The third was this issue
of questionable financial

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:52.520
practices.

00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.770
The holding companies
were accused of stock

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.750
watering-- issuing stock
in excess of company value

00:32:57.750 --> 00:33:00.800
and using this to justify
higher rates; of exaggerating

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:04.310
their operating costs; of
bribing local officials;

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:07.490
and creating various unstable
financial instruments which

00:33:07.490 --> 00:33:12.860
in 1929 were argued to have
contributed to the crash.

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.720
So what was the
solution to these three

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.460
interrelated problems?

00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:19.160
Well, a number of people began
to argue that the solution was

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.930
for the government to
become more involved

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:22.490
in electricity markets.

00:33:22.490 --> 00:33:23.990
One I've already
mentioned, the idea

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:26.150
of federal electricity
generation projects

00:33:26.150 --> 00:33:29.030
like Muscle Shoals
and the Hoover Dam.

00:33:29.030 --> 00:33:31.040
And often these were
proposed in conjunction

00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:33.240
with flood control
and irrigation,

00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:37.140
which were broadly viewed as
legitimate federal functions.

00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:40.530
There were also proposals for
a federal regulatory system

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:42.660
on the grounds that a
federal system would not

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:46.560
be as easily corrupted and
influenced as a local one.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.919
Another argument, however,
was a state-based response.

00:33:49.919 --> 00:33:51.960
And one of the most
interesting ones at this time

00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:54.390
was something
called giant power.

00:33:54.390 --> 00:33:56.190
This was a proposal
to create a system

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:58.620
of integrated statewide
electrical power

00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.930
in Pennsylvania.

00:34:00.930 --> 00:34:04.170
Giant Power was not proposed by
a group of radical communists

00:34:04.170 --> 00:34:05.970
or the International
Workers of the World,

00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:10.030
but rather by Gifford Pinchot,
the governor of Pennsylvania,

00:34:10.030 --> 00:34:12.540
who as many of you know was
the first head of the US Forest

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:16.080
Service and a great advocate
of rational management

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.150
of natural resources.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:20.770
He worked in conjunction with
Morris Llewellyn Cooke, who

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:23.940
was a mechanical engineer in the
tailorist tradition-- so again,

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:29.580
rational analysis of industry
and manufacturing-- and Cooke

00:34:29.580 --> 00:34:33.239
later became the head of rural
electrification in the New Deal

00:34:33.239 --> 00:34:35.310
under President Roosevelt.

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.440
Both of these men were
progressive Republicans,

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.510
although Cooke did
later become a Democrat

00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:41.610
under Roosevelt.
Both were advocates

00:34:41.610 --> 00:34:44.580
of progressive-era scientific
management of industry

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:45.639
and national resources.

00:34:45.639 --> 00:34:49.230
So they were progressives,
but they were not radicals.

00:34:49.230 --> 00:34:51.030
So what was the idea?

00:34:51.030 --> 00:34:53.280
Giant Power was
proposed in 1923,

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.250
and the idea was that you
would build power plants right

00:34:56.250 --> 00:34:57.660
at coal mines--

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.294
at the coal mouth, as it was--

00:34:59.294 --> 00:35:00.960
and then you would
feed that electricity

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.940
into a statewide grid
that would offer power

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.580
to all residents of the
state of Pennsylvania

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.040
at fair and equitable rates.

00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:10.320
Private companies
could still operate,

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.140
but they would be forced
into the state-wide pool.

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:16.740
And all citizens would be
served power at the same rates.

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:20.460
And the state would create a
strong regulatory commission

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.660
to oversee the project.

00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:23.710
Now, why was this needed?

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:26.720
Well, I've already said fair
pricing was one major issue.

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:28.990
But the bigger issue
really was access.

00:35:28.990 --> 00:35:30.850
So I've already
talked about this.

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.370
Gifford Pinchot was particularly
interested in the problem

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:36.250
of getting
electricity to farmers

00:35:36.250 --> 00:35:38.980
who he felt really needed it.

00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.260
Indeed, at this point
already electricity

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:45.880
was coming to be seen not as
a luxury, but as a necessity.

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:48.040
Not as a privilege, but a right.

00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.840
And increasingly
it was also seen

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:54.130
in a kind of technophilic
utopian vision

00:35:54.130 --> 00:35:55.930
as the foundation
for improvement

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:59.540
in the quality of the lives
of the American people.

00:35:59.540 --> 00:36:03.430
So in 1925, for example,
Pinchot wrote, "Giant Power

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:06.370
is a plan to bring cheaper and
better electric service to all

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.260
those who have it
now, and to bring

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.180
good and cheap electric
service to those

00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.800
who are still without it.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.560
It is a plan by which most
of the drudgery of human life

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.680
can be taken from the shoulders
of men and women who toil

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:22.210
and replaced by the
power of electricity."

00:36:22.210 --> 00:36:25.450
The industry considered
this to be a huge threat.

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:27.550
The electricity industry
was growing rapidly,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:30.250
and was highly profitable,
and as I've already mentioned,

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:31.810
was developed in
the United States

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.880
as a private sector activity.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.220
But there were competing
models from other places,

00:36:36.220 --> 00:36:39.070
and the industry worried
that the United States might

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:41.290
actually squeeze out
the private generator

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:46.090
and replace it with a federally
or state controlled system.

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:48.880
Giant Power was drawing
on these other models,

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:50.980
and it did seek
deliberately to, quote,

00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:53.320
"change the direction
of the utility industry"

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.210
as the historian of
technology Tom Hughes

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.250
wrote many years ago.

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:00.330
Industry opponents viewed
it as an unfair taking,

00:37:00.330 --> 00:37:03.700
as socialistic, and a threat
to freedom, as well as a threat

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.270
to their profits.

00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:07.885
So the Pennsylvania Electric
Association wrote, quote--

00:37:11.450 --> 00:37:12.380
that's a typo, sorry--

00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:14.420
"The clear purpose
of this plan is

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.580
to take from any
electric service system

00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:18.470
the benefits it has
thus far accrued

00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:22.400
by reason of able management,
successful financing,

00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.740
painstaking research
work, and courage

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.780
in the replacement of apparatus.

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.640
Private initiative
is to be supplanted

00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:31.537
by a political plan based
on a socialistic theory

00:37:31.537 --> 00:37:33.620
and offering the possibilities
of the construction

00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:38.246
of a statewide all-powerful
political machine."

00:37:38.246 --> 00:37:40.620
Now, the proponents here were
invoking what the historian

00:37:40.620 --> 00:37:43.710
David Noble has called
technological Darwinism,

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:46.530
the argument that because
the electricity had developed

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.980
in a certain way to date that
this was necessarily the best

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:53.250
way, and it was the result
of the hard work and fitness

00:37:53.250 --> 00:37:57.450
of the able managers and smart
financers, smart investors

00:37:57.450 --> 00:37:59.660
who had done this.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:02.120
We could argue about whether
or not those claims were true,

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.880
but whether or not they
were, one could certainly

00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:07.730
imagine a rational argument
about the pros and cons

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:10.850
of private and
public sector systems

00:38:10.850 --> 00:38:13.940
and a rational discussion
of how to get electricity

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.970
to rural customers who were
not well-served by the existing

00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:18.320
system.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.510
But that's not what happened.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:23.300
Instead, NELA launched a
massive propaganda campaign

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:27.230
to discredit Giant Power, to
discredit Gifford Pinchot,

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:29.270
and to discredit
any form of publicly

00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.980
generated or distributed
electrical power,

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.800
whether on the municipal,
state, or federal level.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.290
So what did they do?

00:38:36.290 --> 00:38:38.630
Well, according to the
Federal Trade Commission,

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:41.720
everything but sky writing.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:44.870
They targeted newspapers
and other print media,

00:38:44.870 --> 00:38:47.810
supplying press releases,
articles, editorials,

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:50.096
many of which were written
by third party allies--

00:38:50.096 --> 00:38:51.470
that is to say,
people who didn't

00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:53.930
appear to have a link to
the electricity industry,

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.940
but in fact were being paid.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.060
They attempted to influence
radio, film, and theater.

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:01.520
They launched attack on
politicians like Pinchot who

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:04.220
supported Giant Power or
other public projects,

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.740
so similar to what we've seen
the Americans for Prosperity

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.150
do today.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.160
But really interestingly,
particularly

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:13.460
for us with our
motto of veritas,

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:17.660
their largest focus was actually
us, the educational system,

00:39:17.660 --> 00:39:20.580
high school and
higher education.

00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.680
And in particular they
focused on textbooks.

00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:27.220
NELA undertook a survey of
all the existing high school

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.800
and college texts that
were being used in civics

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.930
and economics classrooms.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.720
And then they began to
pressure publishers, colleges,

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.750
and universities, and school
districts, and libraries

00:39:37.750 --> 00:39:41.340
to drop text that they
considered objectionable.

00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.920
So what made a
textbook objectional?

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.830
Well NELA claimed that the
texts were not objective

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:48.840
or that they were socialistic.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.670
But if we look at the
documentary evidence,

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:52.290
we begin to see
that actually they

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:54.150
objected to almost
anything the cast

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:57.060
industry in an unflattering
light or anything that

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.460
suggested that there could
be a place for publicly

00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:01.925
generated electricity.

00:40:01.925 --> 00:40:03.300
I think I'm going
to kind of skip

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.450
through some of the details
about some of the things

00:40:06.450 --> 00:40:10.410
that they objected to, but
here's a list of terms,

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:12.990
so specific terms that
NELA found objectionable

00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.280
in textbooks.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.790
Over-capitalization,
stock watering,

00:40:17.790 --> 00:40:20.250
abuses in rate
making, weaknesses

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:24.420
in regulatory practices,
reasonable rates, fair return,

00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:26.730
or even the term public utility.

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:28.594
So anything that
suggested that there

00:40:28.594 --> 00:40:30.510
might be a problem, that
the industry was less

00:40:30.510 --> 00:40:33.630
than completely honest, or
less than completely fair,

00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:36.840
or that even there was a
concept of a fair return, all

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.200
of these terms were
considered objectionable.

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.820
So what did they do?

00:40:41.820 --> 00:40:44.340
They began to target the
authors of these textbooks

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:48.640
and offered them money to write
new editions of the books.

00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:51.431
And if they agreed to do it,
which many did because, sure,

00:40:51.431 --> 00:40:53.180
who wouldn't want to
update their textbook

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.510
and be paid for it, right?

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:56.550
Then after they had
agreed, then they

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.210
sent them a list of suggestions
for suggested changes.

00:41:00.210 --> 00:41:02.640
If the authors said no,
they weren't interested,

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.240
then they hired other authors
to write alternative textbooks.

00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.370
And the consistent pattern
and theme in these books

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:11.762
was to promote the ideology
of free market capitalism.

00:41:11.762 --> 00:41:13.470
And then once the
textbooks were written,

00:41:13.470 --> 00:41:15.510
they sent free copies
to schools, colleges,

00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:18.660
libraries across the country,
and began to pressure schools

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.080
to adopt them, arguing that the
existing textbooks were biased,

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.910
and anti-American,
and socialistic,

00:41:23.910 --> 00:41:28.130
but the new textbook was
fairer and more objective.

00:41:28.130 --> 00:41:31.130
They also funded academic
studies in universities

00:41:31.130 --> 00:41:34.820
to prove that public power was
more expensive than private.

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:36.260
And once these
studies were done,

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.490
then they heavily promoted
them to the press,

00:41:38.490 --> 00:41:41.570
through press releases,
bulletins, and funded lecture

00:41:41.570 --> 00:41:42.500
tours.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.612
So someone would agree
to write a report that

00:41:44.612 --> 00:41:46.070
was favorable to
the industry, then

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.840
they would pay for
them to go on a lecture

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:50.310
tour around the country.

00:41:50.310 --> 00:41:52.710
And they worked to
develop curricula

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:55.140
at colleges and
universities in America.

00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.819
And I am actually-- in
some written materials,

00:41:57.819 --> 00:42:00.360
I actually have a list of the
universities that are involved,

00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.520
and it's really scary,
and it includes Harvard.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.140
So they developed
specific courses--

00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:10.080
in some cases, whole curricula--
in economics and business

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.250
administration.

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:12.750
And the purpose,
in their own words,

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:15.690
was, quote, "to ensure straight
economic thinking," by which

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.150
they meant capitalistic
free-market laissez faire

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:20.446
principles, and to
ensure the possession

00:42:20.446 --> 00:42:22.320
by young people and
their teachers of, quote,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.420
"correct information."

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.600
And they even gave funding
to establish departments

00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:30.614
in schools, one of which was
the Harvard School of Business.

00:42:30.614 --> 00:42:32.280
So I can't wait to
get into the archives

00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.900
to look at these materials.

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.810
So what would constitute
success in their view?

00:42:37.810 --> 00:42:41.430
Quote, "When judges, lawmakers,
members of the public utility

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:43.980
commissions, prosecuting
attorneys, and engineers--

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:46.320
in short, all public officials--

00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:49.080
will be so trained
as automatically

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.690
to oppose genuine
regulation, public ownership,

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:55.560
honest valuations,
equitable rates, et cetera."

00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:57.930
When I read that paragraph,
I couldn't help but think

00:42:57.930 --> 00:43:01.530
of this document from 1998
when the American Petroleum

00:43:01.530 --> 00:43:03.420
Institute issued a
document that said,

00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.080
victory will be achieved
when average citizens quote,

00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:10.440
"Understand--" slash
recognize-- "uncertainties

00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.990
in climate science,
recognition of uncertainties

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.330
becomes part of the
conventional wisdom,

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.920
the media understands
uncertainties

00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:17.860
in climate science.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:21.000
And if we go down to the bottom,
those promoting the Kyoto

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:24.300
Treaty on the basis
of extant science

00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:28.210
appear to be out of
touch with reality."

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:30.660
Now in all these
activities, they often

00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:33.900
work through, as I've already
mentioned, third party allies--

00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:35.400
other groups or
other individuals

00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.292
to try to hide or minimize
the NELA connection.

00:43:38.292 --> 00:43:39.750
And particularly
this was true when

00:43:39.750 --> 00:43:41.520
they funded academic studies.

00:43:41.520 --> 00:43:43.050
They would try to
hide the funding.

00:43:43.050 --> 00:43:45.360
So a report would come
out, but it would nowhere

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:48.720
disclose that the report had
been wholly funded by NELA.

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.540
And this was obviously to make
the studies appear independent,

00:43:51.540 --> 00:43:54.090
and therefore
objective and credible.

00:43:54.090 --> 00:43:57.960
The FTC concluded not just that
this was a propaganda campaign,

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.300
but that it was the largest
peacetime propaganda

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:02.620
campaign in US history.

00:44:02.620 --> 00:44:05.900
And academics had played
a key role, especially

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.620
academic administrators, many
of whom had welcomed NELA help,

00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.140
enthusiastically accepting
NELA funds to develop

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:13.320
courses and departments.

00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:16.550
So Robin Kelsey,
I'm looking at you.

00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:19.856
But you know, I think we've
all seen this happen, right?

00:44:19.856 --> 00:44:21.230
And as I've already
said, experts

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:25.850
who are used then to lend
credibility to these reports.

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.866
So I think it's pretty obvious--

00:44:27.866 --> 00:44:29.240
I don't think I
have to belabor--

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:31.040
that there are an awful
lot of similarities

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:32.630
to recent developments.

00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:34.430
In recent years we've
seen how creationists

00:44:34.430 --> 00:44:36.170
have written
textbooks of their own

00:44:36.170 --> 00:44:39.260
and put pressure on school
districts and publishers

00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.080
to adopt these textbooks,
or to use textbooks

00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.050
that they consider
unobjectionable textbooks that

00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:48.920
raise the uncertainties
in evolutionary biology.

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:51.260
We've shown and we know how
the tobacco industry funded

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:53.870
so-called expert studies to
prove that tobacco was not

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:57.527
harmful, and to create
competing facts and narratives.

00:44:57.527 --> 00:44:59.360
And of course, in the
area of climate change

00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.160
denial, the repeated accusation
that climate scientists

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.180
are socialists.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.520
Or my favorite one
is when I was accused

00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:11.130
by Professor-- professor,
ha ha, wishful thinking.

00:45:11.130 --> 00:45:12.950
I was accused by
Senator James Inhofe

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.260
of being part of the
liberal conspiracy

00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:18.400
to bring down global
capitalism, to which I respond,

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.920
liberals should be so organized.

00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.130
The NELA's strategy is
really the Merchants

00:45:26.130 --> 00:45:27.450
of Doubt strategy.

00:45:27.450 --> 00:45:29.450
It didn't begin with
the tobacco industry.

00:45:29.450 --> 00:45:31.290
It's actually much older.

00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.920
Cast doubt upon adverse facts
about your product or industry,

00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:36.720
impugn the motives and
credibility of those

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:38.670
who are making
factually based claims,

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:41.060
accuse them of being
socialists and communists,

00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.810
and insist that it's
the government that's

00:45:42.810 --> 00:45:45.750
threatening your freedom, and
that the private sector is

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:49.320
actually what's preserving,
protecting, and defending it.

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:51.750
And recruit third
party allies, or even

00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:54.760
create entire front
organizations.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.690
So if we go skip again
back to the present,

00:45:57.690 --> 00:46:00.600
one of the front organizations
that Erik Conway and I studied

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:04.530
was a group called TASSC, The
Advancement of Sound Science

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.040
Coalition.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.430
This is a group that promoted
the idea that policy should

00:46:08.430 --> 00:46:10.506
be based on sound science.

00:46:10.506 --> 00:46:11.880
And who could
argue against that?

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.190
Who wouldn't agree that
public policy should

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:16.050
be based on sound science?

00:46:16.050 --> 00:46:19.090
Except the problem is
that TASSC actually

00:46:19.090 --> 00:46:21.870
was a wholly created
organization,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:25.200
a front organization for the
Philip Morris tobacco company.

00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:27.867
They hired a PR firm,
APCO Associates ,

00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:30.450
and there's a really interesting
materials about this in which

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:33.360
they actually talk about
why they need to hire APCO,

00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.300
because their previous PR
agency, Burson-Marsteller,

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:39.240
was now viewed as too obviously
associated with the tobacco

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:40.890
giant.

00:46:40.890 --> 00:46:43.020
This was launched
in November 1993

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.540
with press releases and calls to
journalists around the country.

00:46:46.540 --> 00:46:48.970
John Boltz, a manager of media
affairs at Philip Morris,

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:52.110
supplied APCO with a list
of sympathetic journalists.

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:54.390
But APCO, not Boltz,
would place the calls,

00:46:54.390 --> 00:46:58.080
quote, "to remove any
possible link to PM," i.e.

00:46:58.080 --> 00:46:59.550
Philip Morris.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:02.400
Among TASSC's activity was
they created a sound science

00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.810
in journalism award.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:06.630
And the first award was granted
to New York Times reporter Gina

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:09.330
Kolata who they said,
quote, "had responsibly

00:47:09.330 --> 00:47:12.360
detailed how science has
been distorted or manipulated

00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.630
to fuel litigation on
silicone breast implants."

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:17.430
What they didn't
tell you was that one

00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:18.930
of the principal
funders of TASSC

00:47:18.930 --> 00:47:23.820
was Dow Corning, the
maker of breast implants.

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.670
So let me step back
now from this history

00:47:26.670 --> 00:47:28.650
and talk a little bit,
then, about the larger

00:47:28.650 --> 00:47:31.470
problem of post-truth America.

00:47:31.470 --> 00:47:34.710
I think it's obvious from
what I've shown you today,

00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:37.500
and I think most
historians would say this,

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:41.190
that post-truth
isn't post at all.

00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:43.710
The term post-truth may
be new, but the practices

00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:45.840
associated with it are not.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:48.390
What we see here is actually
a century-old pattern

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:50.760
of disinformation
aimed at promoting

00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:53.610
the interests of private
capital by confusing people

00:47:53.610 --> 00:47:55.920
about facts regarding
their products

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:58.230
and by demonizing
the alternatives,

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.870
in part by asserting that
those alternatives threaten

00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:03.210
American freedom.

00:48:03.210 --> 00:48:05.900
So what is the relationship
to us, to the humanities

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.670
and the Humanities Center?

00:48:07.670 --> 00:48:10.190
Well, I'm an unusual academic.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:11.480
I'm not competitive.

00:48:11.480 --> 00:48:13.820
I don't like having
something all to myself.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.960
I like company.

00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.160
I like friends.

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.330
I'm sociable.

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:20.030
I would like you all to get
involved in this project.

00:48:20.030 --> 00:48:22.760
Because I think there are
some giant questions here

00:48:22.760 --> 00:48:24.920
that we have not
engaged with in the way

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:28.370
that we could and should
in really profitable ways.

00:48:28.370 --> 00:48:30.320
So this is a complicated story.

00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.290
I've only just shown you a few
little tidbits, a few details.

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:34.790
Hopefully a couple
of years from now

00:48:34.790 --> 00:48:37.340
I can tell you a much
richer and fuller story.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.050
But this is, even
with these tidbits,

00:48:39.050 --> 00:48:41.090
we see that this is
a very complex story

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:45.680
at the nexus of science,
technology, politics, economy,

00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:49.400
money, and power, in both senses
of the word-- electrical power

00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:52.400
and political power, which
have been closely linked

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.010
this country for 100 years.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:57.410
But humanities scholars I
think have been a bit slow

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:59.940
to study this and
similar issues.

00:48:59.940 --> 00:49:03.290
There's very little humanities
literature on tobacco,

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:07.380
and only recently has there
been much on climate change.

00:49:07.380 --> 00:49:09.880
The most famous
intervention in my field,

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:13.350
which is STS, history of
science, on creationism,

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:15.690
is the sociologist Steve Fuller.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:17.230
So I guess he's a sociologist.

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.450
So maybe he doesn't count.

00:49:18.450 --> 00:49:24.000
But in STS, Steve Fuller,
who defends creationists.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.020
NELA was the subject of a major
set of federal investigations

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:28.890
in the 1930s.

00:49:28.890 --> 00:49:30.750
30 volumes of materials.

00:49:30.750 --> 00:49:33.570
And yet there is no recent
secondary literature on it

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.010
at all.

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.930
I first discovered
this by rereading

00:49:36.930 --> 00:49:40.800
Tom Hughes's book, Networks
of Power, published in 1983,

00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.750
and David Nye's book,
Electrifying America,

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:44.250
published in 1990.

00:49:44.250 --> 00:49:46.240
In Hughes' book,
it's a footnote.

00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.180
In Nye there's a
paragraph, a few sentences.

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:53.970
But this is a story
about power and values.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.250
It's not just about electricity.

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.530
Many environmental
issues are fundamentally

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:00.427
issues of power and values.

00:50:00.427 --> 00:50:02.010
So you might think
the humanists would

00:50:02.010 --> 00:50:04.710
be at the forefront of the
analysis of these issues.

00:50:04.710 --> 00:50:07.570
As Homi said at the
start of this evening,

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:09.720
these are issues about
care, about. what

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:12.840
we care about and what
we should be caring for,

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:15.239
and what we're not caring for.

00:50:15.239 --> 00:50:17.280
But by and large we haven't
been at the forefront

00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:18.840
of these issues.

00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.810
So why have humanities
scholars paid relatively little

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:24.330
attention to these
juicy, and interesting,

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:26.350
and important topics?

00:50:26.350 --> 00:50:28.320
So I want to just throw
out a few ideas, mainly

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:30.360
just to provoke conversation.

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.070
Because I think there
is a conversation

00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.870
that we need to have about this.

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:36.840
And I say this in part based
on my experience teaching

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.550
and the way my students
react to these questions.

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:44.180
And so I call this the shadows
of symmetry and postmodernism.

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:47.210
When I first started talking
about the findings that became

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:49.580
the book Merchants of Doubt--
this is now going back 10

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:50.420
years--

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:52.670
I found that my historical
colleagues were actually

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.950
very interested,
because historians

00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:56.940
are interested in
power, and politics.

00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:00.110
And so it wasn't a hard sell to
get my colleagues, for example,

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:02.300
in US history to be interested.

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.910
But my colleagues in
science studies and STS

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:07.100
were extremely uncomfortable.

00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.410
And some said out
loud that they thought

00:51:09.410 --> 00:51:12.130
I was violating the
symmetry principle.

00:51:12.130 --> 00:51:14.440
Now, does everybody
here know what that is?

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.230
No, OK.

00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:18.950
So in science studies, one of
the most influential figures

00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:22.880
in our field is David Bloor,
who early on back in the 1970s

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.460
promoted what he called the
strong program in sociology

00:51:25.460 --> 00:51:26.390
of science.

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.530
And he argued that good
sociology of science, good STS,

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:34.550
had to be symmetrical, by which
he meant that we should treat

00:51:34.550 --> 00:51:37.550
the causes of true
and false beliefs,

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.850
we should look for the
same kinds of causes

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.050
in explaining both
true and false beliefs.

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:44.930
So we should be examining both
empirical and social causes,

00:51:44.930 --> 00:51:49.910
but we should not presuppose
that a true belief is caused

00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:51.829
by empirical evidence
but a false belief

00:51:51.829 --> 00:51:53.870
is caused by social
interests, that we should not

00:51:53.870 --> 00:51:55.400
make that presupposition.

00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.610
I'll say more about
that in a minute.

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.180
But it wasn't just colleagues,
it was students, too.

00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:05.280
Even today students
who come into history

00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:06.940
of science out of
STS backgrounds

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:10.140
sometimes explicitly
say that they, quote,

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:14.040
"think were not allowed" to say
that the electricity industry

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:16.350
claims were false,
that we're not allowed

00:52:16.350 --> 00:52:19.380
to use the word false or
true, and that we're not

00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:22.320
allowed to say that
public power in fact costs

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.450
less than private electricity.

00:52:24.450 --> 00:52:26.790
And the phrase, not
allowed, is a phrase

00:52:26.790 --> 00:52:29.220
I have heard in my classroom
more than once, which

00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.710
I have to say I find
extremely disturbing to think

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:34.110
that in a great
university we're not

00:52:34.110 --> 00:52:37.189
allowed to say certain
things, whatever they are.

00:52:37.189 --> 00:52:38.730
But especially when
we're not allowed

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:41.640
to use the word true,
or false, or fact.

00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:44.820
So recently my student, Eric
Baker, who's here tonight--

00:52:44.820 --> 00:52:46.740
stand up and be counted, Eric--

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:49.260
and I wrote an
article, and I call

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.630
it Truth Without Scare Quotes.

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:53.130
The argument here
is that the idea

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:55.020
that our disciplinary
commitments do not

00:52:55.020 --> 00:52:57.240
permit us to say that
one side of a debate

00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.820
has facts or even the
weight of evidence as

00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:02.340
judged by scientific
experts on its side,

00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:05.250
or to suggest that a settled
scientific consensus might

00:53:05.250 --> 00:53:08.280
bear some kind of meaningful
relationship to truth.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.930
More broadly, we can
characterize this

00:53:09.930 --> 00:53:13.470
as a sort of reticence even
to invoke cognitive categories

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:16.380
or to discuss truth without
putting the word in scare

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.130
quotes.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:18.504
And my students
who are here will

00:53:18.504 --> 00:53:19.860
know what I'm talking about.

00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:22.193
Now, I want to make a really
important point here and be

00:53:22.193 --> 00:53:25.200
clear about what I'm saying.

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.360
This is not an argument
against symmetry

00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:29.460
as a methodological
starting point.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.310
My own work is deeply
influenced by David Bloor.

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:34.930
I think his argument in
science and social imagery,

00:53:34.930 --> 00:53:37.170
which was first
published in 1979,

00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.720
was an incredibly
important intervention.

00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.340
But he was arguing
that we should

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:45.060
consider both epistemic and
social factors in our analyses

00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:49.470
and not prejudge which was more
pertinent in any given case.

00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:50.970
And so I already explained this.

00:53:50.970 --> 00:53:52.230
And I agree.

00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:54.720
I think that was a very
important intervention

00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.810
and rightly influential.

00:53:57.810 --> 00:54:00.520
But I think that a good deal
of science studies literature,

00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.460
including some
canonical work, there's

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.760
been a conflation of symmetry
as a methodological starting

00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:06.330
point--

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:09.510
that is to say, what is your
initial assumption approaching

00:54:09.510 --> 00:54:10.380
a problem--

00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.182
versus an empirical endpoint.

00:54:12.182 --> 00:54:14.640
That is to say, it's one thing
to say we shouldn't prejudge

00:54:14.640 --> 00:54:16.590
the case, but it's
another thing to say

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.620
that after doing five
years of archival research

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:21.510
you couldn't come
to the conclusion

00:54:21.510 --> 00:54:23.970
that the empirical evidence
was largely on one side

00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:25.740
and not on the other.

00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.630
Yet I think that
actually many of us

00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:29.970
have felt that we can't do that.

00:54:29.970 --> 00:54:32.580
I would like to argue that
empirical and social causes do

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:33.780
play a role in all belief.

00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.280
I think Bloor and
other colleagues

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.690
are correct about that.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:40.440
But I also want to say that
it's an empirical question

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:43.860
as to how much of a role
they play in any given case.

00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:47.370
And that is, historians, or
sociologists, or philosophers,

00:54:47.370 --> 00:54:51.240
or literary theorists, we
could look at that question

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.580
and we might learn something
important if we did.

00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.390
No, I think if we put it this
way it's actually obvious.

00:54:57.390 --> 00:54:58.920
But I think the
shadow of symmetry

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:02.580
has made many STS scholars
have trouble, A, identifying

00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:05.760
empirical causes,
and B, as taking them

00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.680
as ever being determinative.

00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:09.810
And that leads many to
assume that scientists'

00:55:09.810 --> 00:55:12.690
claims about empirical
drivers and their beliefs

00:55:12.690 --> 00:55:16.170
have to be viewed skeptically
not just as a starting point,

00:55:16.170 --> 00:55:18.620
but at all times
in investigations.

00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.370
And if you think I'm
creating a straw man,

00:55:20.370 --> 00:55:22.910
and I'm very sensitive because
I hate it when academics create

00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:24.285
straw mans, I'm
going to give you

00:55:24.285 --> 00:55:26.190
an example to prove
that this is really

00:55:26.190 --> 00:55:28.030
happening even as we speak.

00:55:28.030 --> 00:55:30.840
So just this year some
colleagues in science studies

00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:34.230
criticized consensus
studies, including my own,

00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:37.770
as taking the side of
scientists or assuming the truth

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.270
value of their
claims, and therefore

00:55:39.270 --> 00:55:43.060
as being illegitimate
intellectually.

00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.790
So I want to argue that
these attitudes contribute

00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:49.750
to what Stephen Colbert
famously called truthiness

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:53.500
in a good deal of
literature about science.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.770
And that, of course, leads
to postmodernism in general.

00:55:56.770 --> 00:56:00.010
So without getting into a big
debate about postmodernism

00:56:00.010 --> 00:56:02.260
and how much it has or
has not influenced larger

00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:04.480
cultural and political
trends, I think

00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:06.820
it is fair to say, or
at least to suggest,

00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:09.250
or at least to
raises a question,

00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:12.430
that by de-stabilising
notions of truth and facts,

00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:15.280
postmodernism has made
it more difficult for us

00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:18.760
to talk about what is wrong with
things like the NELA propaganda

00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.110
campaign.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:22.420
And I want to argue that
that's problematic both

00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:25.180
empirically and morally.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.030
Empirically because a
fetishistic attachment

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:32.140
to symmetry and certain
postmodern ideals can lead us--

00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:35.140
not necessarily, but I
think it often does--

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.240
into an ahistorical
false equivalence,

00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:41.470
and morally because it
becomes very difficult, if not

00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:45.250
impossible, to make a credible
case for why an industry should

00:56:45.250 --> 00:56:48.730
be held accountable for
damage caused by its products.

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:51.160
And I may be wrong
about this, and if I am,

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:55.990
and if you think there's a way
to solve this using symmetry

00:56:55.990 --> 00:56:57.650
or post-modernism,
then let's have

00:56:57.650 --> 00:57:00.400
that conversation because I
think that would be great.

00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.530
So I just want to
end with one example

00:57:02.530 --> 00:57:06.650
that I think is
important and compelling.

00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:09.560
And that's the
question of lead paint.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.060
I think it's fair
to say that we all

00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:14.180
know that lead paint interferes
with children's brain

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:15.770
development.

00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:19.340
But if we ask the question,
how do we know this?

00:57:19.340 --> 00:57:21.470
The answer has to
be that we know it

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:23.660
through the work of our
scientific and public health

00:57:23.660 --> 00:57:24.680
colleagues.

00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.900
Through the consensus
of experts--

00:57:26.900 --> 00:57:28.610
our colleagues in
the medical school,

00:57:28.610 --> 00:57:30.560
our colleagues in the
school of public health,

00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.450
and scientists, and
medicine doctors,

00:57:32.450 --> 00:57:35.004
and public health
officials in hospitals,

00:57:35.004 --> 00:57:36.920
and medical schools, and
public health schools

00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:40.400
all across this country who have
weighed the available evidence

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:44.000
and concluded that it
demonstrates that when

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.760
infants and young children
are exposed to lead it

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.620
affects their brain development.

00:57:49.620 --> 00:57:53.160
But if we can't invoke hybrid
social cognitive categories

00:57:53.160 --> 00:57:56.580
such as consensus, much
less empirical categories

00:57:56.580 --> 00:57:59.670
such as evidence, then we're
hamstrung in any effort

00:57:59.670 --> 00:58:03.600
to explain why we are warranted
in saying that lead paint leads

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.800
to brain damage in children.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:08.550
Now of course, there
are many other issues

00:58:08.550 --> 00:58:11.255
that are raised by the things
I've talked about tonight,

00:58:11.255 --> 00:58:13.740
and I've written a talk that
I hope is sort of deliberately

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.930
provocative and there
are many other things we

00:58:15.930 --> 00:58:17.140
could talk about.

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:19.320
And one of the things
I haven't talked about

00:58:19.320 --> 00:58:22.770
is the problem that we don't
want to be accused of bias.

00:58:22.770 --> 00:58:25.050
And of course, as academics
that's a real problem.

00:58:25.050 --> 00:58:28.380
We want to, as much
as possible, being way

00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:31.020
different points of view,
and not, as Bloor said,

00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.660
presuppose that we know that
the answer to a question

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:35.200
is one thing or another.

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:39.030
But I will leave you with
one final thought, something

00:58:39.030 --> 00:58:42.480
that the great Ashley
Montague said a long time ago,

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.910
reality has a
well-known liberal bias.

00:58:44.910 --> 00:58:46.538
Thank you very much.

00:58:46.538 --> 00:58:49.532
[APPLAUSE]

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:01.508
Sure.

00:59:01.508 --> 00:59:02.506
Yeah, great.

00:59:09.492 --> 00:59:12.786
Does Homi get the prerogative
of the first question?

00:59:12.786 --> 00:59:16.610
Yes, he does, as
a matter of fact.

00:59:16.610 --> 00:59:20.134
So I'm actually just sitting
up here to keep you company.

00:59:20.134 --> 00:59:21.050
Oh that's nice of you.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:22.520
In this crowd I
can't imagine there

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:27.170
aren't plenty of questions to
get the conversation started.

00:59:27.170 --> 00:59:28.910
Well, I just want
to say thank you.

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:33.110
I thought that was
incredibly interesting,

00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:35.150
and also a cautionary tale.

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:37.520
At this moment when
we're searching

00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:40.490
for a new president for
this great university,

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:44.180
one of the issues that
arise in many conversations

00:59:44.180 --> 00:59:46.610
is what is the relationship
between the university

00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:48.140
and industry?

00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.230
Which is a boundary that's being
redrawn at many institutions

00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:55.670
and in different ways
within our own institution.

00:59:55.670 --> 01:00:00.650
And so you've provided us
with quite a sobering story

01:00:00.650 --> 01:00:02.280
about that relationship.

01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:04.760
So I thought that
was very timely,

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.570
and I thank you for that.

01:00:06.570 --> 01:00:14.120
I was also reminded of a passage
that occurs early on your book

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:17.750
on continental
drift, where you talk

01:00:17.750 --> 01:00:24.350
about the tendency of historians
to regard truth as contingent

01:00:24.350 --> 01:00:26.390
through a very
pithy paragraph, I

01:00:26.390 --> 01:00:28.730
wish I could remember
the exact wording.

01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:30.770
And then the tendency
of scientists

01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:33.530
to want to arrive
at truth, which

01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:38.400
is not linked to time and
space in that localized way.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.240
And you ask whether or not
it's possible to resolve this,

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.770
and in some sense you're still
at this very difficult question

01:00:45.770 --> 01:00:50.090
about how we reconcile
that understanding.

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:50.660
Yeah.

01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:51.410
Well, that's true.

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:53.960
I mean, I think part of the
key to an academic career

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:56.540
is to dig your teeth
into juicy questions

01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.670
that you can live
with for a long time.

01:00:58.670 --> 01:01:02.450
Questions that will justify,
in a sense, a long marriage.

01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:06.050
So yeah, I think that I have
come back to that question

01:01:06.050 --> 01:01:07.550
repeatedly in different ways.

01:01:07.550 --> 01:01:09.830
And that feels like a
really satisfying thing

01:01:09.830 --> 01:01:12.870
to be able to do.

01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:14.030
No, I agree with you.

01:01:14.030 --> 01:01:15.590
The great questions
are not questions

01:01:15.590 --> 01:01:18.690
we then answer and move
on to other things.

01:01:18.690 --> 01:01:19.940
And that's why I don't--

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.981
--push us us through
an entire life.

01:01:21.981 --> 01:01:23.480
And that's why I've
never understood

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:27.230
scientists or academics who are
territorial about their work.

01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:29.100
I mean, if the
question is big enough,

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:33.071
then there's room for
a lot of people, right?

01:01:33.071 --> 01:01:34.280
Homi, do you have a question?

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:45.350
So Naomi, I was absolutely
both terrified and entertained.

01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:50.570
[LAUGHTER] Really
you hit a lot of--

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.790
you ticked off a lot of a very
good, very important boxes.

01:01:54.790 --> 01:01:58.250
And this talk was
particularly sobering

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:03.500
on a day on which I read this
morning, I think in The Wall

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:12.070
Street Journal while I was on
a plane, that 46% of voters

01:02:12.070 --> 01:02:18.420
believe that Trump is being
represented by the media

01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:22.980
as peddling fake news,
when in fact the fakery

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:24.900
is on the part of the media.

01:02:24.900 --> 01:02:26.040
46%.

01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:27.580
Now you know, polls change.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:33.780
And then 31% thought
that Trump and a lot

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.380
of his anti-regulation
team, et cetera,

01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:41.370
were in fact that the truth
was not on their side,

01:02:41.370 --> 01:02:43.830
that they were
manipulating facts, 31.

01:02:43.830 --> 01:02:47.080
And the rest were undecided.

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.650
And that's a very
sobering thought.

01:02:49.650 --> 01:02:52.650
And we can come back to that
any way in which you like.

01:02:52.650 --> 01:02:58.480
But what your talk
made me think about

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:08.350
was this kind of repetitive
cycle of the manipulation

01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:15.010
of news, values, the
manipulation of it

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:17.260
by special interests,
particularly

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.550
those of free market capital
in the name of freedom

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:24.900
and the individual.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:27.930
And at each time
when this happens,

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:31.860
there is a mass of evidence
that this is happening.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:34.870
People know it,
just as we do today.

01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:39.450
We know it, and yet 46% think
that Trump is telling the truth

01:03:39.450 --> 01:03:41.850
and is being misrepresented
by the media.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:48.250
So the issue here really
is one of ideology

01:03:48.250 --> 01:03:51.520
as much as it is of
science, as you said.

01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:56.680
But what is it about
the resistance,

01:03:56.680 --> 01:04:02.260
about this repetitive resistance
of the ideology of freedom

01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:06.070
which allows people
to fantasize--

01:04:06.070 --> 01:04:08.490
and I'm being very biased here--

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:13.430
to fantasize that their
freedoms are being taken away,

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.980
their individual privacy is
being threatened, and so on.

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.570
Now I just want to
say, I don't believe--

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.740
I mean, people have described
me as a postmodernist

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:26.630
ever since I was
more or less born.

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:28.430
You were born postmodern.

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:30.090
But I am not.

01:04:30.090 --> 01:04:33.160
And to condemn
myself even further,

01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:34.570
I would say if
there is anything,

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:37.600
I've been a post-structuralist,
not a postmodernist.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.180
And there is a big
difference between the two.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.600
But if there is one thing that
a lot of the jejune claims

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:47.230
of postmodernism gets right,
if there's one thing--

01:04:47.230 --> 01:04:50.920
and I very much oppose-- there's
a postmodernism of everything.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.410
There's a postmodernism
of shoe production,

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:57.000
postmodernism of
movies, or architecture.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.830
But if there's one
thing it suggests

01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:07.490
is that iterative processes
which are non-teleological

01:05:07.490 --> 01:05:14.150
can raise questions
about truth or reality

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:16.140
in a contextual framework.

01:05:16.140 --> 01:05:19.430
So iteration is not
about the notion

01:05:19.430 --> 01:05:22.430
of a kind of evolutionary
or continuous system

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:25.610
leading to a certain
teleological notion

01:05:25.610 --> 01:05:27.626
of freedom or whatever.

01:05:27.626 --> 01:05:29.000
And so in that
case, I would have

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.300
thought that you
could have harnessed

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:37.610
certain ideas of
temporality and technology,

01:05:37.610 --> 01:05:42.260
and temporality and
truth, against those

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:48.590
who run the wagons straight
in a kind of teleological line

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:51.050
towards the notion of freedom.

01:05:51.050 --> 01:05:55.250
So I thought certain
concepts of postmodernism

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:59.780
could be valuable
to your inquiry

01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:02.570
and disrupt this
notion of truth,

01:06:02.570 --> 01:06:06.290
and linearity, and teleology
in which a lot of these claims

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.190
are made.

01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:11.430
But my real question
is, why can't we--

01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:13.970
my question's what
I said earlier.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:17.880
Why are we, when we have
all the evidence, why

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:24.630
do people still want to hold on
to their ideological beliefs,

01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:27.180
even when they're
self-destructive?

01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:31.800
And your talk has shown that
this is a cyclical process.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:34.620
It's not an evolutionary
or teleological.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.310
And today we see this
more than ever before.

01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.380
Yeah, I agree.

01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:44.070
That's a really
important question.

01:06:44.070 --> 01:06:49.290
And I think in a way that's
what I like from this talk,

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:50.844
I'd like to have
that conversation,

01:06:50.844 --> 01:06:52.510
because I don't know
the answer to that.

01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:54.380
And I wouldn't even
begin to think I could

01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:55.550
start to answer it tonight.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:58.008
But I think those are the kinds
of questions that we really

01:06:58.008 --> 01:06:59.330
need to be talking about.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:02.400
And those questions
don't get asked

01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.290
most of the time
about climate change.

01:07:05.290 --> 01:07:07.760
I've gone to hundreds of
conferences about climate

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:11.300
change in the last decade,
and that question never

01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:14.210
gets asked, the question
of why Americans

01:07:14.210 --> 01:07:17.420
can be persuaded that
regulating carbon dioxide

01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:18.710
threatens their freedom.

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:21.650
Or like we say in the
film, how Americans

01:07:21.650 --> 01:07:23.870
could be enrolled as allies--

01:07:23.870 --> 01:07:25.460
so here I'll use
the tour, right?

01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:27.680
I mean, Americans were
enrolled as allies

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.960
in the defense of the
interests of the tobacco

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:33.740
industry against their own
interests in public health

01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.750
because they were
persuaded by the argument

01:07:35.750 --> 01:07:37.770
that their freedom
was somehow at stake.

01:07:37.770 --> 01:07:40.149
So it proves that it's an
extremely powerful argument.

01:07:40.149 --> 01:07:41.690
And so we have to
take that on board,

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:44.890
and we have to realize that
if that's what's going on--

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:47.480
and in some ways it's too
bad more of our scientific

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.190
colleagues here, but this is
part of what I've been trying

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:50.750
to say to the
scientific community--

01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:54.260
if that's what's going on, then
no amount of charts and graphs

01:07:54.260 --> 01:07:59.150
about death, tobacco-related
mortality and morbidity--

01:07:59.150 --> 01:08:01.970
will solve this problem.

01:08:01.970 --> 01:08:05.120
Because if I think my freedom
is being threatened by tobacco

01:08:05.120 --> 01:08:08.150
regulation, I'm not
going to be influenced

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:11.120
by an argument about tobacco
morbidity and mortality.

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.980
And it's the same
with climate change.

01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:15.770
If I think that
the Democrats want

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:18.319
to tell me where I can
live, and where I can work,

01:08:18.319 --> 01:08:20.351
and what car I
can drive, I'm not

01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:22.100
going to be influenced
by an argument that

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:25.939
says, oh, but look at
the sea level rise,

01:08:25.939 --> 01:08:27.649
you know, this sea
level has risen

01:08:27.649 --> 01:08:31.880
another inch since this decade,
or this rate of sea level rise

01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:34.609
has doubled, or look at
the exponential growth

01:08:34.609 --> 01:08:36.800
in the rate of sea level
rise in North Carolina.

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.466
No, that's going to
be irrelevant to me.

01:08:38.466 --> 01:08:40.979
Because I believe that my
freedom is being threatened.

01:08:40.979 --> 01:08:43.670
And so that's part of the point
of this argument is to say--

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:47.359
it's a category error to
think that this problem can

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:49.220
be addressed with
more scientific data

01:08:49.220 --> 01:08:51.979
if what's fundamentally
at stake it's

01:08:51.979 --> 01:08:54.470
people's ideological
commitments and their beliefs

01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:57.370
about the character
of American culture.

01:08:57.370 --> 01:09:00.770
And it's linked also to not
just the idea of freedom

01:09:00.770 --> 01:09:02.870
in an abstract way,
but to a belief

01:09:02.870 --> 01:09:06.620
that what makes America great,
what makes life in America

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.162
great, is that we're
a free country,

01:09:08.162 --> 01:09:10.370
and that we have a level of
freedom that is unmatched

01:09:10.370 --> 01:09:11.490
anywhere in the world.

01:09:11.490 --> 01:09:14.630
Whether or not that claim is
true is not the relevant point.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:18.439
The claim is that that claim
is persuasive for many people.

01:09:18.439 --> 01:09:22.670
So I think this is an
incredibly helpful way

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:27.580
to reframe what's going
on around climate change.

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:30.350
It leads me, anyway,
to think that this

01:09:30.350 --> 01:09:34.779
is a view into, in some
sense, the unconscious of them

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:39.590
problem, the sort of social
unconscious of the problem.

01:09:39.590 --> 01:09:42.080
But it does make me wonder
whether the iterations are

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.000
exactly the same.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.359
Whether what's underlying
the resistance to climate

01:09:47.359 --> 01:09:49.520
change really can--

01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.640
we can hang that on the
same ideology of freedom.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.420
And this is really an
open question about

01:09:56.420 --> 01:10:00.290
whether or not that's true, but
it's a very intriguing idea.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:02.720
And I think the
other question that's

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:07.760
related that arises for me is
the age old question of why

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:10.160
Americans are so
suspicious of government

01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:13.910
control over their lives
and not corporate control

01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:17.030
over their lives,
especially now.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:18.170
I mean, really?

01:10:18.170 --> 01:10:20.940
Like, it's the government
that's controlling your life?

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:24.470
It's not Facebook,
it's not-- you know.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:25.680
And that may change.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:26.930
I mean, we live in an
interesting moment,

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:28.400
because people are
starting to talk

01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:31.880
about the ways in which
Facebook or Google have access

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:33.920
to all this information,
and your privacy

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.517
is probably more threatened
by them than the government

01:10:36.517 --> 01:10:38.600
because they are probably
more efficient to gather

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:39.600
information.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:43.410
But just about the
returning of certain themes.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:47.630
I mean, I always say, history
is neither a line nor a cycle,

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:49.460
it's a spiral.

01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:51.744
So we spiral back around
to certain themes,

01:10:51.744 --> 01:10:53.660
but of course, they're
never exactly the same.

01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:56.210
The arguments about
freedom in 2017

01:10:56.210 --> 01:10:58.430
are not going to be exactly
the same as the arguments

01:10:58.430 --> 01:11:01.040
about freedom in
1937, but there are

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:03.350
going to be certain family
resemblances, right?

01:11:03.350 --> 01:11:07.340
And we do see certain words and
certain motifs being recycled.

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:09.320
And the fact that they
are recycled and seem

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.230
to be recycled with
effect is telling us

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:15.140
something about certain
kinds of persistent patterns

01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:16.445
in American culture.

01:11:16.445 --> 01:11:19.370
May I just throw one thing
in here please, just one

01:11:19.370 --> 01:11:20.330
quick thing?

01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:22.700
We've been talking
about freedom.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.290
But I think the issue is
not freedom in general.

01:11:25.290 --> 01:11:27.290
I think there's a specific
thing that's come out

01:11:27.290 --> 01:11:30.020
which is the freedom of choice.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:31.520
And I think that's
a different thing

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.050
from just thinking
about freedom,

01:11:33.050 --> 01:11:37.250
because it's so much linked
to the market ideologies.

01:11:37.250 --> 01:11:39.740
So I think the specific
form of freedom

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:42.070
that people always
feel threatened about

01:11:42.070 --> 01:11:43.850
is freedom of choice.

01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:48.290
Not freedom of movement,
or freedom of speech,

01:11:48.290 --> 01:11:52.640
but my choice is being
somehow determined.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:54.060
Other questions?

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:54.560
Yeah?

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:03.330
Thank you, Jed
Schwarzman, Somerville.

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:05.730
Thank you for that
reference to David Bloor,

01:12:05.730 --> 01:12:09.200
I never heard of him, and
I'm supposedly in sociology.

01:12:09.200 --> 01:12:16.940
[LAUGHTER] Presuming that the
Wall Street Journal report

01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.390
about 46% favoring
Trump is correct,

01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:23.960
which I think it's
probably a fair assumption.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:33.490
But the essence of a news
report is much more difficult

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:37.540
than the rejection of the
completeness of a news report.

01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:41.320
So that if you deconstruct
Trump's it's fake news

01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:50.500
to it's not an adequate report,
that in fact is much easier

01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:57.160
to accept, and in fact, is truer
than a claim that a report from

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.200
a news report--
any news report--

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:03.910
is a complete and adequate
depiction of what happened.

01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:06.320
I'm just trying to explain--

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:12.310
not defend Trump, but to explain
why it's actually slightly--

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:19.410
I mean, if you change it from
fake news to it's not adequate,

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.820
then it makes more sense that
people actually believe him

01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.430
because there's a
skepticism about reality

01:13:24.430 --> 01:13:26.030
in the country as a whole.

01:13:26.030 --> 01:13:28.780
And that that's the
essence of my comment.

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.590
Thanks very much.

01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:32.590
Questions?

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:44.020
I read On Liberty by
Jon Stewart last week,

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:46.420
and I was going over my notes.

01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:51.010
And in the last section he
has one little paragraph where

01:13:51.010 --> 01:13:53.804
he talks about the
main laws, which were--

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:54.845
I'm sorry, the what laws?

01:13:54.845 --> 01:13:55.490
The main laws.

01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:56.800
The main laws.

01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:03.190
Which evidently were about
regulations to selling liquor.

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:05.770
And the preface to
his little paragraph

01:14:05.770 --> 01:14:09.350
is, the person who
is selling a product

01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:15.320
has a vested interest in your
buying that product, maybe

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:18.410
against their own interests
that want to sell more of that.

01:14:18.410 --> 01:14:20.310
And I thought that was
really interesting.

01:14:20.310 --> 01:14:23.330
He doesn't elaborate on that,
but that was interesting.

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:27.270
Let me give you some references.

01:14:27.270 --> 01:14:31.830
George Seldes and in
fact, from the 1930s

01:14:31.830 --> 01:14:35.910
on talking, about
cigarette smoking.

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:37.140
Really interesting.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:41.130
I think this stuff also goes
back into the 1850s and John

01:14:41.130 --> 01:14:48.260
Stuart Mill talking maybe
possibly about morphine

01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:50.390
and opium.

01:14:50.390 --> 01:14:52.460
Talking about liquor.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.410
Lead, Thomas Midgley, Jr.

01:14:54.410 --> 01:14:57.140
Could we get a question?

01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.090
I just want to give
you these references.

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:02.810
Thomas Midgely, Jr. and
the lead in gasoline,

01:15:02.810 --> 01:15:05.120
testifying before
Congress while he's

01:15:05.120 --> 01:15:07.500
suffering from lead poisoning,
saying there's no problem.

01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:15.040
What is interesting to me is for
over a decade I've been saying,

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:16.460
solar is civil defense.

01:15:16.460 --> 01:15:20.272
It doesn't matter what you
believe about climate change.

01:15:20.272 --> 01:15:22.480
We know that there's going
to be a weather emergency,

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:25.880
and therefore we should
have a light, you know,

01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.700
a phone or radio.

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:31.240
You can do that with a
couple of inches of PV panel

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:33.380
and you're set.

01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:35.990
So if you talk
about that, you're

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:39.000
moving towards a transition.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:43.590
But I say this to Michael Mann
last year, climate scientist,

01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:49.200
and I say, this gets us
out of the right fighting,

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.027
the argument.

01:15:51.027 --> 01:15:52.110
What do you think of that?

01:15:52.110 --> 01:15:55.490
And he says, no.

01:15:55.490 --> 01:16:00.290
They have to believe
the science, right?

01:16:00.290 --> 01:16:03.790
So what is it about us
that we would rather

01:16:03.790 --> 01:16:09.430
fight about truth and falsity
rather than do something

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:15.570
that we all know is a
legitimate precaution, whatever

01:16:15.570 --> 01:16:18.730
we believe about climate?

01:16:18.730 --> 01:16:20.150
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:22.900
I can't speak for
Mike Mann, but I

01:16:22.900 --> 01:16:25.751
will say the following about
our scientific colleagues.

01:16:25.751 --> 01:16:27.250
And I think I can
say this because I

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:31.210
used to be one of them, or
sort of still am in some ways.

01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.710
When you're raised
as a scientist,

01:16:32.710 --> 01:16:36.220
you're raised to believe
that knowledge is power.

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:38.080
Goes back to bacon.

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:43.480
And that idea is so
deeply ingrained that

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:47.830
to accept that it might not
be, to accept that you might do

01:16:47.830 --> 01:16:52.250
the greatest, best, most
elegant, most powerful

01:16:52.250 --> 01:16:55.250
scientific analysis in the
world and people would just

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:59.090
say to you, [SCOFFS]
I don't believe it,

01:16:59.090 --> 01:17:00.770
the cognitive dissonance
created by that

01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:02.960
is so profound
that I don't think

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:04.967
most scientists can bear it.

01:17:04.967 --> 01:17:06.800
Because if you really
come to grips with it,

01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:09.380
your whole world
potentially collapses.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.620
Because then why are
you working so hard?

01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:14.930
And it's hard being a scientist.

01:17:14.930 --> 01:17:17.540
I mean, those of us in the
humanities and social sciences,

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:20.190
we can moan and groan about
how we don't get paid as much,

01:17:20.190 --> 01:17:21.440
or we don't get loved as much.

01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.150
But the reality is our
scientific colleagues

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:24.830
work unbelievably
hard and spend a lot

01:17:24.830 --> 01:17:27.320
of time hustling for money.

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:31.220
Why are you doing all that if
you don't believe in your heart

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:34.520
that the knowledge
that you produce

01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:39.210
will be used by people in
meaningful and effective ways?

01:17:39.210 --> 01:17:43.550
And when you see the evidence
of the way in which that doesn't

01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:46.630
happen, I think if you
come to grips with it,

01:17:46.630 --> 01:17:49.470
it's kind of crushing, actually.

01:17:49.470 --> 01:17:52.410
So I think many scientists
don't come to grips with it.

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.940
And even people I
know well, people

01:17:53.940 --> 01:17:57.750
I consider friends, people
who I consider sophisticated,

01:17:57.750 --> 01:18:00.690
will still say things to me at
the end of the day like, well,

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:04.590
but I still believe you know
at the end of the day society

01:18:04.590 --> 01:18:09.690
will have to act on this,
people will have to accept this.

01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:13.290
And you know, I want
that to be true.

01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:15.090
But as an historian,
I don't believe it is.

01:18:15.090 --> 01:18:17.980
As an historian, I think, you
know, this could go either way.

01:18:17.980 --> 01:18:23.670
It could be that people accept
it and we convert our energy

01:18:23.670 --> 01:18:25.716
system, and it could
be we don't, and we

01:18:25.716 --> 01:18:27.840
have the collapse of Western
civilization scenario.

01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:29.670
And that's partly why
I wrote that book.

01:18:29.670 --> 01:18:31.545
Because I wanted people
to see what it looked

01:18:31.545 --> 01:18:33.720
like if you took
seriously the possibility

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.570
that we completely failed
to act on what we know.

01:18:36.570 --> 01:18:38.310
And so that's the
motif of the book.

01:18:38.310 --> 01:18:41.190
The historian of the future
who is asking the question, how

01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:44.770
is it possible they did
so much and did so little?

01:18:47.710 --> 01:18:49.130
Other questions?

01:18:49.130 --> 01:18:49.745
Yeah?

01:18:49.745 --> 01:18:51.870
This gal over here's been
waiting for a while, too,

01:18:51.870 --> 01:18:55.036
so you might next time call her.

01:18:55.036 --> 01:18:56.450
Yeah, go ahead.

01:18:56.450 --> 01:18:58.640
Hi, we've spoken a
lot about the role

01:18:58.640 --> 01:19:04.760
of the scientist in the process
of media production of what

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.660
is truth.

01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:07.370
Could you speak a
little bit about how

01:19:07.370 --> 01:19:10.250
you might have encountered
the artist, so to speak

01:19:10.250 --> 01:19:12.280
in your historical research?

01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:15.050
And in addition to
that, what role you

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:20.360
think art might play in
navigating post-truth politics?

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:21.980
Well I want to start
by saying I think

01:19:21.980 --> 01:19:23.146
art has a huge role to play.

01:19:23.146 --> 01:19:25.280
It's one of the few areas
I'm optimistic about.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.410
And I know I saw Carson
Kreitzer was here earlier,

01:19:27.410 --> 01:19:28.493
and looks like she's left.

01:19:28.493 --> 01:19:31.730
But she's writing a play right
now about climate change,

01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:34.370
and she did a reading
with actors yesterday

01:19:34.370 --> 01:19:37.010
that I went to, and it was
so exciting and thrilling.

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:40.400
So I hope that if her
play gets produced at ART,

01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.705
you all go and see it.

01:19:41.705 --> 01:19:43.370
I think it's
incredibly important,

01:19:43.370 --> 01:19:46.760
because I think it's
one of the places where

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.850
we are able to actually
think through questions

01:19:49.850 --> 01:19:54.560
in ways that can get
us out of the boxes

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:56.720
that we walked in with.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.750
And good art, when
it's effective,

01:19:59.750 --> 01:20:02.720
reaches people in part
because it frames a question

01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:05.540
in a different way than we
thought about it before.

01:20:05.540 --> 01:20:07.535
Or it suggests
different possibilities.

01:20:07.535 --> 01:20:10.160
And one of the things that's so
difficult about climate change,

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:11.534
I mean, lots of
people these days

01:20:11.534 --> 01:20:13.140
have been quoting
Frederick Jamison.

01:20:13.140 --> 01:20:14.930
We can imagine the
end of the world

01:20:14.930 --> 01:20:17.660
more easily than we can
imagine the end of capitalism.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:20.330
And the crazy thing about it
is that I think he's right.

01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:21.650
I mean, he's right.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:22.550
And it's true of me.

01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:26.630
When I was writing The Collapse
of Western Civilization,

01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:29.030
it was actually quite
easy to sort of imagine

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:32.210
how this whole thing just
goes to hell in a handbasket.

01:20:32.210 --> 01:20:34.679
But then when you start
to think about how

01:20:34.679 --> 01:20:37.220
we could do something different,
which is what I'm working on

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:40.190
now with my post-doc Geoffrey
Supran who was here earlier,

01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:41.600
oh, it's so much harder.

01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:43.100
I mean, so much harder.

01:20:43.100 --> 01:20:46.100
And I don't know why
that is, but it is.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.516
But then if you think about
art and creative work,

01:20:48.516 --> 01:20:49.890
I mean, what is
it that art does?

01:20:49.890 --> 01:20:51.950
Well, one of the
things it does is

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.340
to help us imagine things that
we didn't previously imagine.

01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:57.080
So I think it's
hugely important.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:59.840
And so if you're an
artist, or if you're

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:04.114
thinking about being an
artist, or if you know artists,

01:21:04.114 --> 01:21:06.030
that's where I'm pinning
some of my hopes now.

01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:09.140
That might be a lot of
pressure, because I really

01:21:09.140 --> 01:21:10.419
don't think the solution--

01:21:10.419 --> 01:21:11.710
well, I don't want to say this.

01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.293
I think there's a
lot of possible ways

01:21:13.293 --> 01:21:15.200
in which things
can also go well,

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.690
and I don't give up hope
that there could be--

01:21:17.690 --> 01:21:20.540
I mean, I am very
optimistic about batteries.

01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:22.762
Like, I'm not saying that
technological solutions

01:21:22.762 --> 01:21:23.970
won't play an important role.

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:25.190
I think they will.

01:21:25.190 --> 01:21:27.860
But I don't think that
more scientific information

01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:31.794
is going to be determinative
at this point in history.

01:21:31.794 --> 01:21:34.129
Yeah?

01:21:34.129 --> 01:21:39.830
[INAUDIBLE] so I'm
that kind of artist.

01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:45.920
I was intrigued by your
phrase, social subconscious.

01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.230
Because all during
the conversation

01:21:48.230 --> 01:21:50.780
about why Americans
are doing this,

01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:53.150
you haven't talked about
the rest of the world

01:21:53.150 --> 01:21:55.220
where it's much
less of a problem

01:21:55.220 --> 01:21:57.660
to be obsessed with
personal freedom.

01:21:57.660 --> 01:22:00.110
So this is a kind of psychosis.

01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:03.380
And I'm wondering if of
all the other scientists

01:22:03.380 --> 01:22:05.570
you want to bring
into this discussion,

01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:07.910
where are the psychiatrists?

01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:10.370
Our culture needs to
be psychoanalyzed.

01:22:10.370 --> 01:22:13.590
[LAUGHTER] Have you
thought about that?

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:14.360
Yeah, absolutely.

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.630
So two things.

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.630
So first of all, part of
the way I got involved

01:22:17.630 --> 01:22:21.450
in this whole thing in the first
place was about 10 years ago,

01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:24.080
I was doing a project with a
group of colleagues in England.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.496
It was an international
group that

01:22:25.496 --> 01:22:27.230
was based at London
School of Economics,

01:22:27.230 --> 01:22:30.050
and I was flying to
London pretty regularly

01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:31.810
going like two or
three times a year.

01:22:31.810 --> 01:22:33.560
And you'd get off the
airplane at Heathrow

01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.150
and there were these
big giant signs

01:22:35.150 --> 01:22:37.670
that said BP, Beyond Petroleum.

01:22:37.670 --> 01:22:40.490
And it was like going
to a parallel universe.

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.680
It was like literally
living in a different world.

01:22:42.680 --> 01:22:45.050
And my friends in
Europe would say to me,

01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:46.790
what is wrong with America?

01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:48.660
Like, what the heck
is going on there?

01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.780
And so part of this
project became a project

01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:54.380
to try to understand why the
United States was viewing

01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:56.960
this question in
such a different way

01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.000
than really any other
country in the world.

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.450
There's no other country, and
Australia had some problems.

01:23:02.450 --> 01:23:04.902
Canada was a bit bad under
the Harper government.

01:23:04.902 --> 01:23:06.860
But really there isn't
any country in the world

01:23:06.860 --> 01:23:08.990
where people reject
the evidence of climate

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:12.620
change the way we do here
in the United States.

01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:15.350
So that was part of the problem,
was to try to understand this.

01:23:15.350 --> 01:23:17.420
And again, that's what
brings me back to the idea

01:23:17.420 --> 01:23:19.420
that this is essentially
a humanistic and social

01:23:19.420 --> 01:23:20.810
scientific question.

01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:24.170
This is a question why Americans
reject climate science, right?

01:23:24.170 --> 01:23:27.327
And that's not a question that
climate scientists can answer.

01:23:27.327 --> 01:23:29.660
That's a question that social
scientists, and humanists,

01:23:29.660 --> 01:23:32.990
and artists might
be able to answer.

01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:34.940
And maybe psychiatrists, right?

01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:37.250
So in terms of
psychiatry, I'm not one,

01:23:37.250 --> 01:23:38.987
but some of my best friends are.

01:23:38.987 --> 01:23:40.820
Robert Jay Lifton has
a new book that's just

01:23:40.820 --> 01:23:42.290
come out on exactly this issue.

01:23:42.290 --> 01:23:44.450
So if you haven't read
it, it's a must read.

01:23:44.450 --> 01:23:45.170
He's coming to--

01:23:45.170 --> 01:23:47.270
Good, oh good, I'm
glad to hear that.

01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:50.270
Excellent I think his
work is really important.

01:23:52.937 --> 01:23:54.270
And there have been others, too.

01:23:54.270 --> 01:23:56.000
I mean, there's a
group of psychiatrists

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.820
who have been having
this discussion now

01:23:57.820 --> 01:23:59.420
about Donald Trump,
most in relation

01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:00.860
to the nuclear weapons.

01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:03.485
[INAUDIBLE],, our colleague, had
a letter in the New York Times

01:24:03.485 --> 01:24:05.381
the other day, but I
know that he's also

01:24:05.381 --> 01:24:06.630
thinking about climate change.

01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:09.255
So I think there are people, but
you know, it's a tricky thing.

01:24:09.255 --> 01:24:15.020
Because psychiatrists
don't want to psychoanalyze

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:18.297
individual people, but
then group psychology,

01:24:18.297 --> 01:24:19.380
well, that's a real thing.

01:24:19.380 --> 01:24:22.100
So I do think there are
things to be done there.

01:24:22.100 --> 01:24:24.974
It's not my field, but I
do think it's important.

01:24:24.974 --> 01:24:26.390
The other thing I
was going to say

01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:29.309
is Amitav Ghosh's recent
book, A Great Derangement--

01:24:29.309 --> 01:24:31.850
I mean, I love that book, and
I think it's such a great title

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:32.970
because he's right.

01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:35.390
There's a way in which
this is deranged.

01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:39.350
We're destroying our homes,
we're burning down our houses.

01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:43.670
And if you went home tonight
and set your house on fire

01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:45.500
you would be considered crazy.

01:24:45.500 --> 01:24:47.060
And you will probably be--

01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:49.400
your family or friends, if
you had family or friends,

01:24:49.400 --> 01:24:51.322
would try to get you
psychiatric help.

01:24:51.322 --> 01:24:53.030
And if you didn't have
family and friends

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.890
you might be arrested
as an arsonist.

01:24:54.890 --> 01:24:59.160
But you would be considered
a mentally unstable person.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:01.460
So we're burning down our house.

01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:04.310
And yet somehow
that's normal, right?

01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:06.860
So I think that thinking of
it as a kind of derangement

01:25:06.860 --> 01:25:10.040
is actually a very
powerful way of getting

01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:11.810
at some of these
questions about why we're

01:25:11.810 --> 01:25:13.370
doing the things
we're doing, and why

01:25:13.370 --> 01:25:16.014
we seem to be locked
into certain patterns--

01:25:16.014 --> 01:25:17.930
certain patterns of
behavior, certain patterns

01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:24.588
of economic activity, and we
can't imagine an alternative.

01:25:24.588 --> 01:25:25.088
Yeah?

01:25:29.830 --> 01:25:32.680
So I have two questions.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:35.110
Do we need to
enlighten the masses,

01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:38.680
or do we need to properly
propagandize the masses?

01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.260
Good question.

01:25:41.260 --> 01:25:42.910
Well, that's a
really good question.

01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:43.510
And I guess--

01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:47.310
And is there a difference?

01:25:47.310 --> 01:25:48.870
And is there a difference?

01:25:48.870 --> 01:25:52.590
I guess I'd like to argue for
something like true propaganda.

01:25:52.590 --> 01:25:55.410
I mean, obviously part
of the reason this works

01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:58.580
is because NELA told
the story about a threat

01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:00.390
to things that people valued.

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:03.240
That slide that I showed
more than once deliberately

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.700
of the cute little
boy looks a little bit

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.450
like JFK Jr. with these things.

01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:11.260
The message is, these are things
you care about, your children,

01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.020
your freedom, your
freedom of religion.

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:14.580
And these things are threatened.

01:26:14.580 --> 01:26:15.399
And that's a story.

01:26:15.399 --> 01:26:17.190
It's a narrative, and
it was a powerful one

01:26:17.190 --> 01:26:20.370
that we think we have
evidence was influential,

01:26:20.370 --> 01:26:22.507
at least to some degree.

01:26:22.507 --> 01:26:24.840
And there's been a lot of
talk about this in the climate

01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:25.839
change community, right?

01:26:25.839 --> 01:26:28.212
The climate scientists
don't have a narrative.

01:26:28.212 --> 01:26:29.670
They have facts,
they have figures,

01:26:29.670 --> 01:26:32.400
but they don't have a story
about why this matters.

01:26:32.400 --> 01:26:36.300
So to the extent that one can
tell a true story about why

01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.420
this matters, why things you
care about are threatened,

01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:41.370
because that's the truth, right?

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:43.950
I mean, the NELA story
about the threats to freedom

01:26:43.950 --> 01:26:45.481
could be flipped on its head.

01:26:45.481 --> 01:26:47.230
There's a story about
things we care about

01:26:47.230 --> 01:26:49.770
and things we love that are
threatened by climate change.

01:26:49.770 --> 01:26:52.730
But climate scientists never
talk about love, right?

01:26:55.497 --> 01:26:57.330
The day I knew I was
going to be a historian

01:26:57.330 --> 01:26:59.580
was the day that I
said in a seminar,

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.040
why don't we ever
talk about love?

01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.081
And it was like, you could
have heard a pin drop.

01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.146
But I mean, I became a
geologist because I loved rocks.

01:27:08.146 --> 01:27:10.020
That's the honest to
God truth of the matter.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.640
And I love being
outdoors, and I love

01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:14.550
that sense of being connected
to the natural world,

01:27:14.550 --> 01:27:17.640
and that sense of feeling that
I actually understood something

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.610
really deep and
profound that I could

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:23.220
feel the sense of emotional
connection to geological time.

01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:25.710
Those were all very
emotional things for me.

01:27:25.710 --> 01:27:27.480
But scientists never
talk about that,

01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:29.760
because that's considered
at odds with models

01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:32.397
of scientific rationality.

01:27:32.397 --> 01:27:34.230
But that stands in the
way of communication.

01:27:34.230 --> 01:27:36.188
Because if you talk to
anyone in communication,

01:27:36.188 --> 01:27:38.250
anyone in marketing,
anyone in advertisement,

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.380
anyone in Hollywood,
they will all tell you,

01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:41.940
communication isn't
about the facts,

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:43.200
it's about [THUMP] right?

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:45.610
It's about getting people
here, or here, right?

01:27:45.610 --> 01:27:47.366
It's about what you
feel in the gut.

01:27:47.366 --> 01:27:48.990
And if you see a
movie that's powerful,

01:27:48.990 --> 01:27:51.060
it's because it moves
you emotionally,

01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:53.610
not because somebody made
a good argument, right?

01:27:53.610 --> 01:27:55.300
So I think that's
part of the challenge.

01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.700
So I guess my
answer to you is, I

01:27:56.700 --> 01:27:58.074
think we do need
to tell stories,

01:27:58.074 --> 01:27:59.460
but I don't think
we have to lie.

01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:04.310
I don't think we have to
make up BS because the facts,

01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:05.697
the truth are bad enough, right?

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:07.280
Because I get asked
that question too.

01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:09.374
Like, should scientists
be more alarmist?

01:28:09.374 --> 01:28:10.790
We don't need to
be more alarmist.

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:12.470
The truth is alarming enough.

01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:14.180
So just stick with
the truth, but tell it

01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:17.180
in a way that is compelling and
that connects it to the things

01:28:17.180 --> 01:28:19.602
that people care about.

01:28:19.602 --> 01:28:22.072
Yeah?

01:28:22.072 --> 01:28:24.330
Just like a couple
of more questions.

01:28:24.330 --> 01:28:27.159
So two other kind of prominent
instances of science denial

01:28:27.159 --> 01:28:29.200
that I can really think
of off the top of my head

01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:32.230
are maybe vaccines and
GMOs, which maybe you

01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:34.210
have arguments or
freedom but from a kind

01:28:34.210 --> 01:28:35.602
of against corporate interests.

01:28:35.602 --> 01:28:37.060
So I was wondering
if you've looked

01:28:37.060 --> 01:28:42.400
into the history of those and
how those kind of instances

01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:45.820
come about and are different
from the climate problem,

01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.330
or similar.

01:28:47.330 --> 01:28:49.540
Yeah, I haven't done that
much research on them

01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.210
but I've certainly read
the work of my colleagues

01:28:51.210 --> 01:28:51.770
have written them.

01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.561
So first of all I want
to say on GMOs, GMOs

01:28:53.561 --> 01:28:55.420
are not a case of
science denial.

01:28:55.420 --> 01:28:57.550
That's what Monsanto
wants you to think.

01:28:57.550 --> 01:28:59.920
But the reality
is that GMOs raise

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.840
a lot of complicated issues.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:04.660
One issue is whether or
not they're safe to eat.

01:29:04.660 --> 01:29:06.166
And that is a
scientific question.

01:29:06.166 --> 01:29:08.290
And we do have a fair amount
of scientific evidence

01:29:08.290 --> 01:29:11.140
that suggests that probably
for most people in most cases

01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:13.450
they're probably safe
to eat, although I

01:29:13.450 --> 01:29:16.300
think one could still raise
some questions about that.

01:29:16.300 --> 01:29:19.090
And I don't think we
have really good data

01:29:19.090 --> 01:29:22.380
to identify some people for
whom they might not be safe.

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:24.112
But overall the
scientific evidence

01:29:24.112 --> 01:29:26.570
does say that they're probably
safe for most people to eat.

01:29:26.570 --> 01:29:30.400
So if you were to say
GMOs are not safe to eat,

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:32.175
that would be science denial.

01:29:32.175 --> 01:29:33.550
But there are a
lot of people who

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:35.800
are opposed to GMOs for all
kinds of reasons that have

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:37.270
nothing to do with food safety.

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:40.390
And the GMO industry
Monsanto have

01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:42.940
been trying to collapse
this all down to food safety

01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:45.400
in order to claim that it's
a case of science denial

01:29:45.400 --> 01:29:48.470
and discredit other
kinds of issues that

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:49.910
are being raised about GMO.

01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:52.850
So my favorite example is, if
you read the Papel Encyclical

01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:56.660
on Climate Change, Pope Francis
is against genetically modified

01:29:56.660 --> 01:29:57.280
crops.

01:29:57.280 --> 01:29:58.917
Has nothing to do
with food safety.

01:29:58.917 --> 01:30:00.500
Has nothing to do
with science at all.

01:30:00.500 --> 01:30:01.970
It's not a scientific question.

01:30:01.970 --> 01:30:03.650
It's a theological argument.

01:30:03.650 --> 01:30:06.102
You might agree with it,
you might disagree with it.

01:30:06.102 --> 01:30:08.060
You might like it, you
might think it's stupid,

01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.860
but it's not science denial.

01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:12.600
So I think that's really
important to be clear about.

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:18.330
Vaccine rejection is science
denial in my opinion.

01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:20.849
The best book on that is our
colleague Seth Mnookin at MIT,

01:30:20.849 --> 01:30:22.640
who wrote this book,
The Panic Virus, which

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:27.140
is a really great sensitive
investigation of the families

01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:29.960
of people whose
children have autism

01:30:29.960 --> 01:30:31.700
and who believe that
their autism was

01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:33.787
caused by vaccinations.

01:30:33.787 --> 01:30:35.120
So really, really worth reading.

01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:37.370
It's kind of a
model of how you can

01:30:37.370 --> 01:30:42.110
be sensitive to the concerns
and experiences of people

01:30:42.110 --> 01:30:47.120
without necessarily going native
and accepting their accounts

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:48.330
of what's happened to them.

01:30:48.330 --> 01:30:49.695
So I highly recommend that book.

01:30:49.695 --> 01:30:51.320
But here's the really
interesting thing

01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.600
about vaccine rejection--

01:30:53.600 --> 01:30:58.770
I think rejection is probably
a better word than denial.

01:30:58.770 --> 01:31:01.920
Even though vaccine rejection is
a real phenomenon United States

01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:04.410
and it's having public
health consequences,

01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:06.450
it's still actually pretty mild.

01:31:06.450 --> 01:31:08.310
It's pretty moderate,
there's only about 5%

01:31:08.310 --> 01:31:11.400
of Americans that don't get
their children vaccinated.

01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.220
Now from a public
health perspective,

01:31:13.220 --> 01:31:15.060
that's problematic.

01:31:15.060 --> 01:31:18.180
Because once you get down to
about 90% vaccination rates,

01:31:18.180 --> 01:31:20.920
you begin to lose herd immunity
and people are at risk.

01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:23.880
So 5% to 10% of
vaccine rejection

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:25.980
is a serious public
health issue,

01:31:25.980 --> 01:31:28.800
but it still means that
90% to 95% of Americans

01:31:28.800 --> 01:31:30.340
are getting their vaccinations.

01:31:30.340 --> 01:31:33.570
So that's wildly different
than climate change where

01:31:33.570 --> 01:31:36.270
something like maybe
40% or 50% of us

01:31:36.270 --> 01:31:38.130
are rejecting the
scientific findings,

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:42.150
or creationism where depending
on how you ask the question,

01:31:42.150 --> 01:31:46.680
anywhere from 50%
to 95% of Americans

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:50.160
have views that are at odds with
what evolutionary biologists

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:51.580
think is correct.

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:54.870
So it's a really, really
different kind of case.

01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:57.790
And now add one
more piece to it.

01:31:57.790 --> 01:32:00.030
So in the case of
vaccinations, you

01:32:00.030 --> 01:32:05.340
have the industry is aligned
with science and public health.

01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:07.380
But imagine if that
weren't the case.

01:32:07.380 --> 01:32:10.020
Imagine if industry were
on the side of saying

01:32:10.020 --> 01:32:12.560
that vaccines cause autism.

01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.780
In my opinion, then
we wouldn't just

01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:17.210
have 5% of Americans
rejecting it.

01:32:17.210 --> 01:32:20.270
Then in my opinion we
would have a public health

01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:22.942
crisis of colossal proportions.

01:32:22.942 --> 01:32:24.650
So part of the lesson
of this whole story

01:32:24.650 --> 01:32:26.612
is you have to look at
the alignments, right?

01:32:26.612 --> 01:32:29.070
You have to look at what are
the political alignments, what

01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:32.030
are the economic alignments,
where is power lining up?

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:34.950
The fossil fuel industry
is incredibly powerful.

01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:37.140
And that's one of the
reasons-- not the only reason,

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:40.130
but it's one of the reasons
why doubt and disinformation

01:32:40.130 --> 01:32:41.690
about climate change persists.

01:32:41.690 --> 01:32:44.810
Because you have very,
very powerful corporations

01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:48.050
spending lots and lots of money
to keep those arguments alive.

01:32:48.050 --> 01:32:49.880
Now, creationism
is a bit different.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:53.890
There isn't a kind of
creationist industry.

01:32:53.890 --> 01:32:57.540
But there are some
powerful-- yeah, exactly.

01:32:57.540 --> 01:33:00.389
There isn't a kind of
private sector of creationism

01:33:00.389 --> 01:33:02.430
in quite the same way that
we have private sector

01:33:02.430 --> 01:33:03.480
fossil fuel.

01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.640
But there is a kind of
industry, there's certainly

01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.200
a big social movement.

01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.780
So there it's a kind of
difference of alignments,

01:33:09.780 --> 01:33:12.870
they're more social
alignments, I would say,

01:33:12.870 --> 01:33:14.820
[INAUDIBLE] is
nodding, so OK, good.

01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.855
But the point is, though,
that's if you really

01:33:16.855 --> 01:33:18.480
want to understand
any of these issues,

01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:19.590
they're not all the same.

01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:22.150
They're not all just, oh,
people reject science.

01:33:22.150 --> 01:33:25.330
There are more complicated
dynamics going on.

01:33:25.330 --> 01:33:28.920
And so I think it's
not necessarily

01:33:28.920 --> 01:33:30.422
helpful to lump
them all together.

01:33:30.422 --> 01:33:32.130
I'll just give one
other example of this.

01:33:32.130 --> 01:33:34.357
I did give a talk
recently where I

01:33:34.357 --> 01:33:36.690
talked a little bit about
GMOs, and I used this example.

01:33:36.690 --> 01:33:39.270
National Geographic magazine
about a couple of years

01:33:39.270 --> 01:33:41.250
ago how to cover
story, some of you

01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:44.220
may have seen, which they
called the war on science.

01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:46.380
I'm not personally fond
of warfare metaphors,

01:33:46.380 --> 01:33:48.270
so I didn't really love
that to begin with.

01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:50.130
But then they had
a list of claims,

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:53.250
and the claims were,
climate change is not real,

01:33:53.250 --> 01:33:56.970
evolution didn't happen,
vaccines cause autism,

01:33:56.970 --> 01:33:58.780
GMOs are evil.

01:33:58.780 --> 01:33:59.880
And I'm like, what?

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.580
This is like Big Bird
singing, which of these things

01:34:02.580 --> 01:34:04.170
doesn't belong?

01:34:04.170 --> 01:34:07.380
I mean, GMOs are evil
is a moral claim.

01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.150
Might be true, might be false.

01:34:09.150 --> 01:34:12.930
But it's not a scientific
question, right?

01:34:12.930 --> 01:34:16.300
But yet it's being conflated by
National Geographic magazine,

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:19.970
who you would have thought
would know better, right?

01:34:19.970 --> 01:34:21.090
Good question.

01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:22.216
Yeah?

01:34:22.216 --> 01:34:23.420
Ian.

01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:25.245
Thank you, Naomi.

01:34:25.245 --> 01:34:28.300
The talk was convincing,
eloquent, exciting,

01:34:28.300 --> 01:34:31.310
and a lot of fun.

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:34.143
I never thought about
hats in that way before.

01:34:34.143 --> 01:34:34.642
[LAUGHTER]

01:34:34.642 --> 01:34:35.570
There you go.

01:34:35.570 --> 01:34:39.110
So I'm convinced that the
kind of eloquent statements

01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:41.630
about the role of capitalism
and enterprise capitalism

01:34:41.630 --> 01:34:44.090
in particular, I find
that very convincing,

01:34:44.090 --> 01:34:48.890
and the invocation of the Papal
Encyclical points me to one way

01:34:48.890 --> 01:34:52.100
to explore the historical
particularity of this--

01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:54.020
and this isn't my
question, so it's

01:34:54.020 --> 01:34:56.120
a prompt to further thought.

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:59.150
And that is, if both
of these examples

01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:00.860
are inherent to a
capitalist moment

01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:04.370
and a particular expression of
an American capitalism, then

01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:06.950
what happens if we push
earlier when we get in debates

01:35:06.950 --> 01:35:10.160
over heterodoxy and orthodoxy?

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.170
In the papacy,
for example, do we

01:35:12.170 --> 01:35:14.390
see similar techniques
being put to work,

01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:17.810
or is there something
inherent to this moment

01:35:17.810 --> 01:35:19.430
and this culture?

01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:21.300
And how has that come
up in your thinking?

01:35:21.300 --> 01:35:23.960
And if it hasn't,
then perhaps this

01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:27.380
is something we could think with
our colleagues in the Divinity

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:29.730
School about as we move ahead.

01:35:29.730 --> 01:35:31.940
My question, though, has
to do less with capitalism,

01:35:31.940 --> 01:35:34.040
more with energy.

01:35:34.040 --> 01:35:37.280
So Lenin famously
said, communism

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.000
equals Soviet power
plus electricity.

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.757
The apotheosis of his project.

01:35:44.757 --> 01:35:46.340
And so that led me
to think, OK, we've

01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:49.190
got to think differently
about capitalism here,

01:35:49.190 --> 01:35:51.990
or what's going on with
the electrical stuff.

01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:54.500
And that's my question,
and it's quite open.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:56.780
I'm interested in
hearing you think

01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:01.730
out loud about what's particular
about the electricity here?

01:36:01.730 --> 01:36:04.520
Or if that's too narrow,
then it strikes me

01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:06.440
that two of our
four main examples

01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.020
are energy questions,
fossil fuels and climate

01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:13.580
change, electricity and doubt,
and the freedom of the market

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:16.820
and so why fully 50%
of these examples

01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:21.390
and are coming out of a
key sector of the economy.

01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:23.600
And that's what I'd be
interested in hearing about.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:26.210
What about the energy,
what about electricity?

01:36:26.210 --> 01:36:27.790
Yeah.

01:36:27.790 --> 01:36:30.070
It's a great question, and
I don't know the answer.

01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.487
And like I said,
this is early stages.

01:36:32.487 --> 01:36:34.570
So this is really great
to have this feedback it's

01:36:34.570 --> 01:36:36.081
something I've
thought about, but I

01:36:36.081 --> 01:36:37.330
don't know what the answer is.

01:36:37.330 --> 01:36:39.430
But what is it about
electricity, right?

01:36:39.430 --> 01:36:43.701
Because there's a whole set of
ideologies around electricity,

01:36:43.701 --> 01:36:44.200
right?

01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:46.210
And that quotation
is such a great one.

01:36:46.210 --> 01:36:50.500
This idea that electricity
is so uniquely powerful

01:36:50.500 --> 01:36:54.430
that if you can harness it,
you can do all kinds of things.

01:36:54.430 --> 01:36:57.700
You can make the
communist utopia,

01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.290
but you could also make the
rural American utopia, as well,

01:37:00.290 --> 01:37:00.790
right?

01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:01.915
I mean, isn't that amazing?

01:37:01.915 --> 01:37:06.340
Both Gifford Pinchot and Lenin
think that their problems can

01:37:06.340 --> 01:37:08.560
be solved through electricity.

01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:10.780
So in class today, my
technology seminar,

01:37:10.780 --> 01:37:13.000
we had a whole
discussion today about

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:14.560
technological determinism.

01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:17.240
And this gets to this really
tricky question in history,

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:17.830
right?

01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:21.560
So as historians we
don't like determinism.

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.280
We think everything in life
is complicated, which it is.

01:37:25.280 --> 01:37:29.300
But yet there is something
about certain technologies

01:37:29.300 --> 01:37:34.920
that seemingly make people
think that there's something

01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:38.310
inherently or innately
powerful about them.

01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:41.190
And I think you see
this today in a lot

01:37:41.190 --> 01:37:43.380
of the discussion
around computers and AI

01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:44.600
as well, right?

01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:48.120
But but you see this in
electricity so powerfully,

01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.700
and even the word power, right?

01:37:49.700 --> 01:37:53.340
The way the word power means
both the fuel, the electricity,

01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.040
the fossil fuel, the coal,
but also the political power.

01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:59.130
And is it a coincidence that
we use the same word for both?

01:37:59.130 --> 01:38:03.710
You know, that would be worth
doing some investigation.

01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:06.200
When did the word power
come to mean what we got out

01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:09.960
of burning fossil fuels?

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:12.340
And when--

01:38:12.340 --> 01:38:12.840
1970s.

01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.680
No, it's way before the 1970s.

01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:17.670
I would say it might be the
1870s, or might be the 1770s,

01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:18.390
I don't know.

01:38:18.390 --> 01:38:20.723
But I mean, this would be a
useful thing to think about.

01:38:20.723 --> 01:38:24.210
But electrical power,
energy, thermodynamic power

01:38:24.210 --> 01:38:26.610
is very closely
linked with concepts

01:38:26.610 --> 01:38:29.381
of cultural and
political power as well.

01:38:29.381 --> 01:38:31.630
And you see this in the
Industrial Revolution as well.

01:38:31.630 --> 01:38:33.570
And this is where I'm getting,
like, way outside my field,

01:38:33.570 --> 01:38:34.200
right?

01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:37.980
But when people are talking
about the power of coal,

01:38:37.980 --> 01:38:39.780
when people are talking
about railroads,

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:41.760
when people are talking
about electrification,

01:38:41.760 --> 01:38:44.160
these motifs come back about
how these things are going

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:47.100
to be transformative, right?

01:38:47.100 --> 01:38:49.240
And even the word transformer.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.960
So the analogies, the language--

01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:54.159
so I think I need to do
a lot more work on that.

01:38:54.159 --> 01:38:56.450
And I hope we can think
through this together because I

01:38:56.450 --> 01:38:57.780
think it's really important.

01:38:57.780 --> 01:38:59.310
And maybe if we
could crack that,

01:38:59.310 --> 01:39:01.500
we could also crack
some of these questions

01:39:01.500 --> 01:39:05.562
about why people view technology
as being so determinative.

01:39:05.562 --> 01:39:07.490
And one would want
to think about

01:39:07.490 --> 01:39:12.470
whether energy is really
the key point of kinship

01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:15.100
in those examples,
or whether it's

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:18.710
the interdependence and
the networking that's

01:39:18.710 --> 01:39:20.672
involved in both examples.

01:39:20.672 --> 01:39:22.130
Because if there's
one thing that's

01:39:22.130 --> 01:39:26.720
challenging to American
ideology around capitalism,

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:30.800
it's that your choice
affects other peoples

01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:38.060
in ways that should then
rebound to have effects

01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:41.840
on your capacity to
choose, whether it's

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.790
burning fossil fuels, or
whether it's an electrical grid.

01:39:45.790 --> 01:39:48.440
Right, well that's like
the famous Isaiah Berlin

01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.020
line about freedom for
wolves is death to sheep.

01:39:52.020 --> 01:39:54.860
And I used that line once when
I was talking at the Yellowstone

01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:59.590
coalition, and I thought,
oh, bad metaphor here, right?

01:39:59.590 --> 01:40:01.704
But I think that's true.

01:40:01.704 --> 01:40:03.620
But I also think there's
just this other thing

01:40:03.620 --> 01:40:07.344
about the notion of
the natural monopoly,

01:40:07.344 --> 01:40:09.260
like, that's a really
interesting phrase, too.

01:40:09.260 --> 01:40:10.676
Read Monopolies
are supposed to be

01:40:10.676 --> 01:40:13.940
bad in enterprise capitalism.

01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:15.860
But yet we have these
things like electricity,

01:40:15.860 --> 01:40:18.110
and railroads, and
telephone, and telegraph

01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:21.590
that don't seem to work well
in a free enterprise system.

01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:22.340
So what do you do?

01:40:22.340 --> 01:40:24.650
You say they are
natural monopolies.

01:40:24.650 --> 01:40:26.060
So somehow you
separate them out.

01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:27.860
It's natural for that
to be a monopoly,

01:40:27.860 --> 01:40:29.967
so therefore you allow
it to be a monopoly,

01:40:29.967 --> 01:40:32.300
but then you immediately have
the problem of regulation.

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.091
Because once you allow
it to be a monopoly,

01:40:34.091 --> 01:40:35.480
then it has to be regulated.

01:40:35.480 --> 01:40:36.980
But people don't
like regulation,

01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:40.010
so then you get the corruption
of regulatory agencies,

01:40:40.010 --> 01:40:43.690
and on it goes.

01:40:43.690 --> 01:40:47.046
We'll take one last question.

01:40:47.046 --> 01:40:48.212
Thanks for your talk, Naomi.

01:40:48.212 --> 01:40:51.620
I'll offer really quick
and preliminary suggestion

01:40:51.620 --> 01:40:53.565
as to the origins of
the power question.

01:40:53.565 --> 01:40:54.890
Oh good, yes, excellent.

01:40:54.890 --> 01:40:56.480
Basically horsepower.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.540
Once we start using it
as a unit to measure

01:40:59.540 --> 01:41:03.530
the capacity of our steam
machines and the like.

01:41:03.530 --> 01:41:07.370
But my question goes to sort
of the origins of this project,

01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:08.690
and what you presented earlier.

01:41:08.690 --> 01:41:13.370
You said that you were
really interested in how

01:41:13.370 --> 01:41:16.340
did these people, this cast
of characters in Merchants

01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.200
of Doubt, for instance,
sleep at night,

01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:21.290
and try to humanize
them in a way.

01:41:21.290 --> 01:41:24.860
And it seems as if your
presentation of NELA here,

01:41:24.860 --> 01:41:27.560
it's almost like
COBRA in GI Joe.

01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:30.230
It's just so nefarious.

01:41:30.230 --> 01:41:33.990
And I'm wondering whether,
as you've done your research,

01:41:33.990 --> 01:41:34.490
and--

01:41:34.490 --> 01:41:36.830
I mean, I know you're at
the early stages of this--

01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:40.820
how your understanding of
this new cast of characters

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.700
may be different from the
one that you had presented

01:41:43.700 --> 01:41:45.980
in your earlier work.

01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:49.010
And maybe it's a way
of then getting to--

01:41:49.010 --> 01:41:53.811
I mean, with the ones in in
Giant Power here, I mean,

01:41:53.811 --> 01:41:56.060
do these people really believe
in this kind of freedom

01:41:56.060 --> 01:41:56.910
that they sell?

01:41:56.910 --> 01:42:00.950
And for Merchants of Doubt,
whether those proselytizers

01:42:00.950 --> 01:42:06.510
of freedom, who actually--

01:42:06.510 --> 01:42:09.094
and I know it's difficult to get
to the question of intention,

01:42:09.094 --> 01:42:10.593
but to the extent
that you have been

01:42:10.593 --> 01:42:11.940
able to see in your sources?

01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:13.190
Yeah, that's a great question.

01:42:13.190 --> 01:42:14.534
I think it's too soon to tell.

01:42:14.534 --> 01:42:17.200
I don't have the source material
yet to start getting into that.

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.385
I think when I get into some
of the archives, particularly

01:42:19.385 --> 01:42:21.343
the universities that
worked with these people,

01:42:21.343 --> 01:42:23.810
we may be able to see
a little bit better

01:42:23.810 --> 01:42:27.200
what some of the justifications,
understandings are

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:31.340
and begin to complexify
the story a little bit

01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:33.470
and make them not
so black and white.

01:42:33.470 --> 01:42:37.465
Right now I don't have the
material to do that yet.

01:42:37.465 --> 01:42:38.840
But I think the
other thing also,

01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:41.780
if I think about how I
think about it so far--

01:42:41.780 --> 01:42:44.270
and this, as I said,
is early days--

01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:47.750
but I do see NELA as being
more like the tobacco industry

01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:50.372
than like Bill Nuremberg
and Fred Singer, I mean,

01:42:50.372 --> 01:42:52.580
one of the things that's
interesting about this story

01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:55.280
is, so the entry into the
Merchants of Doubt story

01:42:55.280 --> 01:42:59.652
was a group of men,
people-- four individuals,

01:42:59.652 --> 01:43:00.985
three of whom I knew personally.

01:43:00.985 --> 01:43:02.690
So that's the other thing.

01:43:02.690 --> 01:43:06.120
It's like a kind of
very weird backstory

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.700
to this whole thing about that
I actually knew these people.

01:43:09.700 --> 01:43:12.720
And when I started realizing
what they were up to I thought,

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:14.157
what in the heck are they doing?

01:43:14.157 --> 01:43:15.990
And then there was this
sort of weird almost

01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:18.031
like destiny feeling, even
though I didn't really

01:43:18.031 --> 01:43:21.030
believe in destiny.

01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:22.590
I had come across this story.

01:43:22.590 --> 01:43:25.200
I had met Erik and he had
this whole parallel story

01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:27.597
about the ozone hole.

01:43:27.597 --> 01:43:29.430
And then we looked at
who these people were,

01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:30.750
and he sent me these
documents that he

01:43:30.750 --> 01:43:32.340
had found in the
archives at Scripps,

01:43:32.340 --> 01:43:33.885
which is where I was working.

01:43:33.885 --> 01:43:35.260
And these were
all people I knew.

01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:38.820
And right at the
beginning, when I was--

01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.137
Erik sent me a pile of
materials that he had pulled out

01:43:41.137 --> 01:43:43.470
of the archive that he hadn't
really done anything with.

01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:45.120
And in fact, it's kind
of an ironic story.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:47.578
He was writing a book on the
history of atmospheric science

01:43:47.578 --> 01:43:48.510
at NASA.

01:43:48.510 --> 01:43:51.840
And so he was writing about
the science, not about

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.160
the politics.

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.920
And so he had come across this
whole story about these attacks

01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:59.040
on the scientists who had
worked on the ozone science.

01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:00.900
And he had set it
aside because it

01:44:00.900 --> 01:44:04.890
was this sort of political story
that wasn't part of his science

01:44:04.890 --> 01:44:05.512
story.

01:44:05.512 --> 01:44:07.220
And so when I met him
we started talking,

01:44:07.220 --> 01:44:09.803
said, oh, yeah, I have all this
stuff about how Sherry Rowland

01:44:09.803 --> 01:44:12.450
was attacked by these guys.

01:44:12.450 --> 01:44:13.327
I'll send it to you.

01:44:13.327 --> 01:44:15.660
And so he sends me this stuff,
and I open this envelope,

01:44:15.660 --> 01:44:20.160
and I open the folder, and
the first page is a letter

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.292
on Dartmouth letterhead.

01:44:22.292 --> 01:44:23.750
Now, my first job
was at Dartmouth.

01:44:23.750 --> 01:44:25.791
And if you've ever seen
the Dartmouth letterhead,

01:44:25.791 --> 01:44:26.940
you never forget it.

01:44:26.940 --> 01:44:30.870
Because it's a picture of
Native Americans walking out

01:44:30.870 --> 01:44:33.270
of the woods and
being enlightened

01:44:33.270 --> 01:44:36.540
by the rays of knowledge
that are descending down

01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:39.150
from the heavens
on these savages.

01:44:39.150 --> 01:44:42.020
It's very distinctive.

01:44:42.020 --> 01:44:43.620
And I saw this, I
thought, Dartmouth.

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:45.542
I thought, who at
Dartmouth is doing this?

01:44:45.542 --> 01:44:47.500
And then I look at the
letter who's signing it,

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:50.580
it's Bob Jastrow, and he was
my colleague in my first job

01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:52.870
at the earth science
department at Dartmouth.

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:54.540
So it was kind of
personal for me.

01:44:54.540 --> 01:44:57.000
And the weird thing about
Jastrow-- two weird things.

01:44:57.000 --> 01:45:00.810
So Jastrow was sort of persona
non grata in my department

01:45:00.810 --> 01:45:04.891
at the time because
he was a creationist.

01:45:04.891 --> 01:45:07.140
But he was an old earth
creationist, not a young earth

01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:08.340
creationist.

01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:09.930
But it was a little
bit of an anomaly.

01:45:09.930 --> 01:45:11.554
So this is an earth
science department,

01:45:11.554 --> 01:45:14.750
and we've got this guy in our
midst who's a creationist.

01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:17.960
And he was a very
opinionated person.

01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.690
Not the best colleague
in the world.

01:45:20.690 --> 01:45:24.650
But I thought it was super
interesting-- and remember,

01:45:24.650 --> 01:45:27.285
I'm coming as this sort
of hybrid geologist

01:45:27.285 --> 01:45:28.160
historian of science.

01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.404
So I arrive, and I'm so
young, and I'm so naive.

01:45:30.404 --> 01:45:31.820
And I think it's
super interesting

01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.070
that we have this creationist in
our midst, so I befriended him.

01:45:34.070 --> 01:45:36.200
And I started talking
to him and asking him

01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.220
questions about his beliefs.

01:45:38.220 --> 01:45:40.610
And he starts telling
me what he believes,

01:45:40.610 --> 01:45:43.670
and it's like straight out of
William Paley and 19th century

01:45:43.670 --> 01:45:45.380
natural theology.

01:45:45.380 --> 01:45:48.560
And I think to myself,
this is fantastic.

01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:51.210
This guy is a living fossil!

01:45:51.210 --> 01:45:53.599
[LAUGHTER] So I
spent a lot of time

01:45:53.599 --> 01:45:54.890
talking to him about his views.

01:45:54.890 --> 01:45:57.080
So I knew him kind of
well, and then he retired.

01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.060
He retired a year after
I got there so we only

01:45:59.060 --> 01:46:00.910
overlapped for a year.

01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:03.890
And I knew that he had very
conservative political views.

01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:06.950
He was sort of associate
with Dartmouth Review.

01:46:06.950 --> 01:46:10.490
But I didn't really know
very much about that.

01:46:10.490 --> 01:46:14.800
So now it's 15 years later, and
I said, this is Bob Jastrow.

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:17.060
So he's not just
a living fossil,

01:46:17.060 --> 01:46:19.520
he's also involved in these
weird attacks on science.

01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:21.950
And so one thing kind
of led to another.

01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:25.670
And so those men were always
real people from me right from

01:46:25.670 --> 01:46:28.940
the get-go, so that
in a way helped--

01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:33.120
not to tell the story as a kind
of black hat, white hat story.

01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.030
But as we dug in
the archives, and we

01:46:35.030 --> 01:46:37.585
began to study their connections
with the tobacco industry,

01:46:37.585 --> 01:46:39.710
and then connected to the
literature on the history

01:46:39.710 --> 01:46:41.959
of tobacco like what Allen
Branch, and Robert Proctor,

01:46:41.959 --> 01:46:44.900
and others have done, then
you read these things,

01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.991
you read these tobacco
industry executives--

01:46:46.991 --> 01:46:49.490
if I had had more time I was
going to throw in the clip that

01:46:49.490 --> 01:46:51.980
shows the guys testifying
in Congress saying,

01:46:51.980 --> 01:46:54.560
nicotine is not addictive,
nicotine is not addictive.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:57.600
But then you think, OK, how
do these guys sleep at night,

01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:58.100
right?

01:46:58.100 --> 01:46:59.891
Because they know
they're selling a product

01:46:59.891 --> 01:47:01.640
that is deadly and addictive.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.330
And they testify under oath
that it's not addictive.

01:47:06.330 --> 01:47:08.877
So I mean, these guys
are criminals, right?

01:47:08.877 --> 01:47:10.710
And there are criminals
in the world, right?

01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:12.390
Just like there
are conspiracies.

01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:15.690
So then the historical task
gets to be, how can you

01:47:15.690 --> 01:47:19.650
tell a story about people who
might actually be criminals,

01:47:19.650 --> 01:47:24.714
or who might do criminal things
but still maintain a kind of--

01:47:24.714 --> 01:47:26.130
I don't know,
historical nuance, I

01:47:26.130 --> 01:47:27.921
guess would be the
right way of putting it?

01:47:27.921 --> 01:47:30.810
And in the tobacco story, one
of things that makes that easier

01:47:30.810 --> 01:47:32.280
to do is the fact
that these guys

01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:35.070
were, in fact, prosecuted by
the US Department of Justice.

01:47:35.070 --> 01:47:36.660
So they are criminals,
and I can say

01:47:36.660 --> 01:47:39.240
that they're criminals
as a matter of fact,

01:47:39.240 --> 01:47:41.430
as opposed to as a
matter of moral judgment.

01:47:41.430 --> 01:47:43.105
So part of the challenge
of NELA is then

01:47:43.105 --> 01:47:44.790
going to have to be
go back and that's

01:47:44.790 --> 01:47:46.712
why I made the point
about what they did

01:47:46.712 --> 01:47:48.420
wasn't criminal at
the time because there

01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:49.900
were no laws against it.

01:47:49.900 --> 01:47:53.550
But in 1935 a law
was passed that did

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:56.680
make those kinds of
activities criminal.

01:47:56.680 --> 01:47:58.480
So the mention of
William Paley made

01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:00.190
me look at my watch,
which I notice

01:48:00.190 --> 01:48:03.682
is a highly designed mechanism.

01:48:03.682 --> 01:48:07.180
But thank you so much.

01:48:07.180 --> 01:48:09.020
I know you taught
just before this,

01:48:09.020 --> 01:48:12.040
so we're so grateful for you
coming and doing this, Naomi.

01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:13.300
It's a fabulous talk.

01:48:13.300 --> 01:48:14.020
Thanks so much.

01:48:14.020 --> 01:48:15.870
Thank you.
