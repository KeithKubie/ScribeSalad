00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440
Well, we are going to talk about internet censorship.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.240
So the main components of a communication are usually

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.880
Who is talking to whom,  and what are they talking about?

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.520
So usually the who portion is called the user,

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.500
The Whom portion is called the publisher,

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.320
Which provides some information to the user.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.920
and, the what part,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920
Is the information Itself.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.640
So... internet censorship,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.260
Comprises of...

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.940
A range of steps that the censor might take

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.260
to either stop the publication of information, on the publisher's side.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.880
Or discourage the access to that information or the link that connects the user to the publisher.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.880
Or directly coerce users to not access that information.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.440
But the key point is to stop the information from being disseminated.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.220
I'll give you a very simple example of how censorship takes place,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.880
Which would kind of gives us also an Idea

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.220
Of what are the different mechanisms available.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.280
If youtube.com has been blocked,

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.140
and I am a user

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:15.080
Usually the set of steps that would take place is that I would type "youtube.com" into my browser,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.400
Then behind the scenes my browser would generate a query to a DNS server.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.600
okay it was "youtube.com" but now it's "abc.com"

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.580
so it will generate a DNS Query to the local DNS Server asking

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.780
"what is the IP address to which I should map abc.com?"

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.420
now, either the DNS server would already know the IP address corresponding to abc.com

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.360
Or it would ask other DNS servers, recursively, on the internet,

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.900
and somehow find the IP address corresponding to abc.com

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.040
Once it has that IP address it will return that IP Address

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.140
to the user

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.440
Then the user's browser will use that IP adress

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.820
to connect to abc.com

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.200
which is at 1.2.3.4

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.980
and send an HTTP Get Request

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.240
for some index page.

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.380
and if it all works well,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.640
then abc.com will respond with the corresponding webpage

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.260
now as you can see this involves interaction between different entities.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.600
What a censor can do,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.020
is that it can block the user's connection at this point

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.820
so when the user asks for the IP adress corresponding to abc.com

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:28.440
the censor controlled DNS server could either say that this domain does not exist.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.880
or it can say that oh,

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.640
the IP address corresponding to this domain name is 4.4.4.4

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.580
which is something which is under the control of the censor

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.500
this is called DNS Redirection or DNS Sinkholing

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.280
then, at the IP layer,

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.080
Say, if it doesn't block the connection at this layer,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:48.420
then in the next step

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.980
what a censor can potentially do is that it can block,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.860
user's attempt to connect to 1.2.3.4

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.500
which is called IP Blocking

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.900
and then there's this concept of application layer blocking

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.160
which dosen't involve the domain name, or the IP 
Address

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.580
but rather a sophisticated censor might be able to look at the content,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.420
that is traveling over this channel between the user, and abc.com

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.280
and if it finds some offensive keywords

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:19.560
which are indicative that this connection is

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.800
carrying some information which should be censored

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.400
then based on that keyword

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.500
it will send TCP.. it can potentially send TCP

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.700
reset packets to both sides

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.940
or do something else to just,

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.480
drop packets to just disrupt the communication

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.280
[offscreen] Break the Connection, OKay

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.300
do people get into trouble when they try in to get in these sites? What's it?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.640
is that something that can be traced, when if...

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:44.520
yes

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.100
yeah. So...

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.140
when we talk about the human element of censorship resistance

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.440
this involves publishers of information and also the users of information

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:56.700
and...

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.800
that basically goes into  the area of privacy.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:01.600
and anonymity

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.500
so basically anonymity ensures

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.520
that the users of a censorship resistance system

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.860
may not be traceable.

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:10.240
and...

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.420
what you just mentioned is called coercion of users or coercion of publishers

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.980
and ideally one of the goals of a comprehensive censorship resistance systems

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.340
is to afford that kind of privacy to users

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.980
but usually they don't do that and that's usually something

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.720
that users have to take care of themselves by

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.260
by combining their use of censorship resistance systems with anonymity services like TOR

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.660
[Off screen] I know that a long time ago people would block out things

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.720
in newspapers or blockout things in images and that would be a form of censorship.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.800
So how does it work then when people are censoring in these levels we've just talked about

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:53.800
and yet there's censorship resistance software out there, what's going on, what will be the next "thing"?

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.780
I think it's like an arms race, right? because the technology

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:02.340
that is used to disseminate and retrieve information is constantly evolving

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.420
so now we have social media websites like Twitter,

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.080
Facebook, which have loads and loads of users generated content

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.100
so on the one end it's very difficult for a censor

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.660
to retain that control of information

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.820
because now there is this whole bulk of information

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.440
to go through

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.480
and then also because this content is hosted by sites like

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.900
Google or Twitter

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.000
so they can't just block the IP address of  Twitter

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
and block the IP address of Google

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.200
because that would incur alot of collateral damage

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.580
the false positives that we previously talked about.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:42.040
but when the censor ups their game

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.840
then the censorship resistance systems also take the next step up

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.820
so there's basically a cat and mouse game which is in play here.
