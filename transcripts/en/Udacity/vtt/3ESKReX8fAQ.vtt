00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here's a quick exercise.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Why don't we just define two functions--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
path_states, which takes a path and returns a list of the states,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and path_actions, which takes a path and returns a list of the actions.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
The path is interleaved--it contains both--and we want to pull just the states or just the actions.
