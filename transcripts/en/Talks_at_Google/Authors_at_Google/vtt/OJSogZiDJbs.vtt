JOE: Tonight's speaker
is Nataly Kelly.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:05.760
You may have heard of Nataly.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.720
She is Chief Research Officer
at Common Sense Advisory.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.230
She's been in the Language
Services industry since 1996.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.660
She's fluent in Spanish and
English, and has also studied

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.730
French, Italian, German,
Arabic and Japanese.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.020
She's a former Fulbright
scholar in Spanish

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.200
sociolinguistics, and has
studied in Ecuador, Ireland,

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.750
and the United States.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.440
She is author of "Telephone
Interpreting," the first book

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.380
ever written on the topic, and
"Found in Translation: How

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.390
Language Shapes Our Lives and
Transforms the World." So

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.840
again, if you could hold your
questions till the end, we'll

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.050
have Nataly up here to speak.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.300
[APPLAUSE].

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.080
NATALY KELLY: My Twitter
handle is @NatalyKelly,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.850
N-A-T-A-L-Y-K-E-L-L-Y. And the
handle for the book is

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:03.100
@xl8book, X-L, number 8,
B-O-O-K. [LAUGHS].

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.650
So thank you very much, Joe,
for inviting me here.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.010
And thanks to Ann from Google,
and all of you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.970
for coming out today.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.070
I'm going to talk about
something that I normally

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.360
don't get to talk about--

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.540
normally, I'm talking
about Common

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.000
Sense Advisory research.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.730
And today, I'm actually going to
talk about a book that I've

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:23.600
written with Jost Zetzsche,
who is my co-author.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.000
And the book is called "Found
in Translation." And the

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.720
subtitle is, "How Language
Shapes Our Lives and

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.410
Transforms the World."

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.830
And it's not just a subtitle.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.280
This really means something.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.620
And I'm going to explain why
we chose that subtitle

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.490
throughout my talk.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.780
So, a lot of people, when they
think of translation, think

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250
about academic exercises,
and think about literary

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.330
translation.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.320
And if they think about
interpreting at all, they tend

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.900
to think about conference
interpreting.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.820
Now, how many of you
speak another

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.410
language other than English?

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.790
Almost everybody.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:57.890
Wonderful.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.550
Can I get you to shout out
on the count of three the

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:01.910
languages that you speak?

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:02.270
Ready?

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.553
One, two, three.

00:02:04.553 --> 00:02:06.918
[INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:02:06.918 --> 00:02:07.870
NATALY KELLY: Ooh!

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:10.539
And I heard somebody who's
still counting off the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.070
languages back there.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.050
[LAUGHS].

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.630
Excellent.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.030
So we have a pretty multilingual
group here today.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.220
And how many of you have
done translation work?

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.380
Please raise your hands.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.750
And how many of you have done
paid translation work?

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.960
Professional translation work.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.360
How many of you are full-time
professional translators?

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.260
And how many of you work in
translation, localization,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.530
internationalization today?

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.450
OK.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.980
Great.

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.260
So, many of you are familiar
with some of the concepts that

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.410
I'm gonna be talking about
today, and some of the stories

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.290
that I'll be sharing.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.290
But I'm pretty sure there will
be other stories that you

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.230
haven't heard yet that
come from the book.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.410
And hopefully, it will open up
your mind to how big this

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.490
field is, and how incredible
the field of

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.710
translation really is.

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.120
So, the first point that I
really want to make is that

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.330
translation shapes our lives.

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.575
That's from the subtitle
of the book.

00:03:01.575 --> 00:03:04.250
And I don't just mean the people
who work in this field.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.900
I mean everybody's life.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.020
Translation affects every single
person in the world.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.440
That's my premise.

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.500
So, I'm going to give you some
stories that come from the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.500
book that show exactly how
translation shapes our lives.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.430
So, the first story is
about this word.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.352
"Intoxicado." Now, how many
of you speak Spanish?

00:03:26.352 --> 00:03:27.940
A good number of people
speak Spanish.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.420
Excellent.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.470
So I'm sure all of you know
how to translate this term

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.510
perfectly, right?

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:33.010
[LAUGHS]

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.900
It's a tricky one.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.550
So, those of you who speak
Spanish, don't give me the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.786
answer, please.

00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:39.410
[LAUGHS]

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.460
Those of you who don't speak
Spanish, looking at that word,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.940
you probably think that it
means intoxicated, right?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.690
So there was a bilingual
nurse in a Florida

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.040
Hospital in the year 1980.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.120
And this bilingual nurse heard
the patient came in and his

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.400
family said he was intoxicado.

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.960
So, how did he render that
word into English?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.886
He said, he's intoxicated.

00:04:05.886 --> 00:04:08.410
There's just one problem.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.690
It doesn't mean intoxicated.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.740
This is a pretty difficult word
to translate on its own.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.130
I can give you some examples,
and you can help me figure out

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.190
the meaning.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.440
So "intoxicacion por plomo"
means lead poisoning.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.350
"Intoxicacion por alimentos,"
food poisoning.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:29.590
"Intoxicacion solar,"
sun poisoning.

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.230
So how do you translate the
word "intoxicado"--

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.786
he's intoxicado?

00:04:33.786 --> 00:04:35.274
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:35.274 --> 00:04:35.770
NATALY KELLY: Yeah.

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.700
But do we say in English that
somebody's poisoned?

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.600
We really don't say
that, do we?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.320
We say they have food
poisoning, or

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.930
they have sun poisoning.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.930
So it just goes to show how
difficult it is to translate a

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.850
single word like that.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.370
Now in this case, what happened
was that he was given

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.010
the wrong course of treatment
because of this mistranslated

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.425
word, and a healthy young
man became quadriplegic.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.180
Shortly after, a lawsuit
followed, and a $71 million

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.680
settlement was the result of
this mistranslation as well.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:17.220
So this is often known as
the $71 million word.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.900
Right.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.020
So there are consequences to
mistranslating a single term.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.980
Consequences that are important
in terms of the

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.950
human value, as well as the
economic and financial

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.960
repercussions.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.810
Let me give you another
example that also

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.660
comes from the book.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.830
So, this is an example of
something that happened in

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.150
Haiti, January 12, 2010.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.510
We remember what
happened then.

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:46.170
This was when the earthquake
took out most of the

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:48.270
communications.

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.930
Now, we have a special
guest with us today.

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.660
Rob, would you mind
standing up?

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:59.580
So, Rob is a researcher, and
developed a very impressive

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.720
system that was able to use the
only form of communication

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.860
that was available when
all other forms of

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.560
communication went down.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.070
These were text messages
or SMS messages.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.390
So the system that
Rob created--

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.590
and his work as a researcher
at Stanford--

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.840
was called Mission 4636.

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:24.670
And this system allowed him
to gather more than 1,000

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.380
volunteers in 49 countries.

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.840
And because of this system, in
the first six weeks after the

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:30.430
earthquake--

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.080
or after the program
was launched--

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.840
there were more than 40,000
messages that were translated

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.790
in 10 minutes or less,
all via text message.

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:41.650
Now, you might think, well,
why would these

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.870
text messages matter?

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:46.730
The rescuers who were rescuing
people on the ground spoke

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:47.470
different languages.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.760
Many of them were coming through
international aid and

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.290
relief organizations.

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.540
So in order for them to reach
people-- in order for them to

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.450
find out what was wrong, give
them lifesaving treatment,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.960
help them find shelter, help
them find safety--

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.740
those translations
really mattered.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:02.870
They saved human lives.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.310
They saved hundreds of lives.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.240
So the work that Rob did, and
the work that all those

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.400
volunteer translators did,
had a tremendous

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.710
impact on human life.

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:16.330
But if you're not convinced yet
that translation shapes

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:19.180
your life, I'll give you
another example.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.850
Because, so far, I've shown you
how translation affects

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:23.220
other people's lives.

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.290
So you might be asking, well,
how does it affect me?

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.030
Tell me about me.

00:07:26.030 --> 00:07:28.410
I care about me.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.090
So here's an example for you.

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:32.250
The Global Public Health
Intelligence Network, also

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:35.300
known as GPHIN, is mining--

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.200
constantly--

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:39.670
global news reports, and using
automatic translation

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.030
technology to translate
articles

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.460
from English and into--

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.220
into and out of English and
eight other languages.

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.150
So this is machine translation,
automatic

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:50.030
translation.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:53.840
Now, what you might not know
about this system is that

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.850
Swine Flu and SARS--

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.030
the first cases--

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:00.560
were detected by this
particular system.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.660
What it's doing is scanning
for important

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.210
key words, for symptoms.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.560
For things like fever.

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.740
For things like sneezing.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.270
For some of these symptoms that
are the first indicators

00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:12.140
of a public health outbreak.

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.950
So the system issued alerts in
those cases, and the response

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.910
and containment efforts
followed.

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:21.820
So this goes you to show that
translation is behind the

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.630
scenes, keeping us safe,
preventing public health

00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.880
outbreaks from spreading.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.350
How else does translation
shape our lives?

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.620
If you're not convinced yet,
I'll give you another

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:35.159
compelling example.

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.360
On September 10, 2001--

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.539
the day before the
9/11 attacks--

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:43.559
there were some warnings
that were caught.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.710
Warnings that were
issued about what

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:46.810
was about to happen.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.530
So the words "tomorrow is zero
hour" and the words "the match

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:53.970
is about to begin"
were intercepted.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.810
These were recorded and
intercepted from al-Qaeda

00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.872
operatives by US intelligence
agencies.

00:09:00.872 --> 00:09:04.610
Now, there was just
one problem.

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:07.730
These messages were
not in English.

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.230
They were in Arabic.

00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.516
So when do you think they
were translated?

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:19.486
September 12, 2001.

00:09:19.486 --> 00:09:23.150
And it's not to say that if
these had been translated on

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.580
the day that they were
intercepted, that the 9/11

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.340
attacks would have necessarily
been prevented.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:30.150
Obviously, a lot has to happen
for something to be considered

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.540
a credible threat, and
a lot of wheels have

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:34.670
to be put in motion.

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:37.330
But it does go to show the
importance of not only

00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.560
translation, but translation
that happens quickly.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.680
Translation that can happen
efficiently, systematically.

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:47.030
So this comes from official
US Government documents.

00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:49.270
Anyone can look up
this information.

00:09:49.270 --> 00:09:52.440
And it's a well-known fact that
the US Government has had

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.470
a backlog-- tremendous backlog--
of translation that

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:57.470
hasn't been carried out.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.660
And this is a constant
struggle that the US

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:00.940
Government officials
are still facing.

00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.990
So, what happens when
countries go to war?

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.690
How does translation
play a role then?

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.230
Well, translators and
interpreters are constantly

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:16.810
being used when countries come
into conflict with each other.

00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:21.540
This is a picture of a man who
everybody needs to know.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.220
Everybody watching needs to
know and remember the

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:24.910
name of this man.

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:27.480
He is one of the true heroes
of the interpreting

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.660
profession.

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:31.450
His name is Peter Less.

00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:34.630
Now, Peter Less was an
interpreter at the Nuremberg

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:39.620
Trials, where the Nazi war
criminals were tried.

00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:44.430
Peter had the difficult task
of rendering testimony, and

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.340
rendering the words
of some of the

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.430
masterminds of the Holocaust.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.720
This was even more difficult, in
his case, because he was a

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.160
Holocaust survivor himself.

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.910
In fact, his entire family--

00:10:56.910 --> 00:10:59.370
his parents, his siblings,
his grandmother--

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:02.100
were killed in Auschwitz.

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.240
So he had to be the voice
of the people who were

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.560
responsible for these
atrocities.

00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.970
Can you imagine how difficult
that must have been?

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:15.860
But yet, he was able to stand
to that task and to carry it

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.490
out heroically.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:21.410
So he is a name who I hope we
will always think of when we

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:25.320
think of why translation
matters in the world.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:28.240
And again, you may say, this
doesn't affect me.

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.250
This is all about
other people.

00:11:30.250 --> 00:11:32.690
But when we think about access
to justice, and we think about

00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:37.580
carrying out the proceedings
in the legal system,

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.490
translation truly does
affect all of us.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:44.810
If any of us is a victim of a
crime, and the only witness

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:47.650
speaks a language other than
English, do we want to deny

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:50.130
them an interpreter?

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:51.160
Absolutely not.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:55.480
Even the most pro-English-only
person would want that person

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.170
to be able to state
what happened

00:11:57.170 --> 00:11:59.090
if they were a victim.

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:01.000
So I think it highlights
the importance of

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.860
translation in our world.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:04.700
But I'm not done.

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.520
I'll give you another example.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.610
This is another woman who I
would love you to know.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:14.900
Her name is Mara Clara Sharupi
Jua, and she is from the Shuar

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:19.350
indigenous group in the
Ecuadorian Amazon.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.290
And she is a poet.

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.750
And she's here in this picture
reading some of her poems.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.650
And she writes poems in
Shuar and in Spanish.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:31.500
And I'm very privileged to be
her translator, to translate

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.330
her poetry into English.

00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:37.320
Now, you may think, why should
I care, Nataly, about a

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:41.060
translator of a language that
is in the Ecuadorian Amazon?

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.790
How does this affect me?

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.410
Well, it does affect you.

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.460
Because one in every four
ingredients in pharmaceutical

00:12:49.460 --> 00:12:54.100
products come from the
Amazon rainforest.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:58.190
And only between 10 and 20% of
the plants in the Amazon

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:01.090
rainforest have been
categorized.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:06.310
So, many of the secrets of
healing and powers of curing

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:10.300
diseases are locked up in
languages like the one that

00:13:10.300 --> 00:13:11.970
she speaks.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:15.140
So, if there is a cure for
AIDS, for cancer, for

00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:18.220
diabetes, for a lot of
the ails of society--

00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.380
ailments--

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.140
chances are they're there
in the Amazon.

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:25.220
And they're locked up in
languages that translation has

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:26.470
the power to unlock.

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.470
So hopefully I've convinced
you now that translation

00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:33.320
affects your lives.

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:35.720
Now I'd like to try to convince
you that translation

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.440
can be found pretty
much everywhere.

00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:42.150
And this is where things
start to get exciting.

00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:44.730
So, right now, there is actually
a conference going on

00:13:44.730 --> 00:13:48.020
in San Diego at the American
Translators Association.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.820
And the American Translators
Association has

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:51.230
about 11,000 members.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:53.640
There are about 2,000
people there.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.310
And I just was looking on their
conference website at

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:59.480
some of the sessions that
are happening right now.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:03.460
So we have sessions going on
right now that deal with

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:06.870
German accounting standards,
patent abstract translation in

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:10.790
French, interpreting proverbs
and idioms in Korean.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.900
Criminal Terminology
in Brazil.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.930
Slang and Taboo for
the Courts.

00:14:14.930 --> 00:14:17.150
Translating and Interpreting
War Crimes Trials for

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.010
Bosnian/Serbian/Croatian.

00:14:20.010 --> 00:14:23.820
Translating Sexist and
Gender-Neutral Language.

00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.510
Things like understanding the
clinical trials that you're

00:14:26.510 --> 00:14:28.270
translating and the
science behind it.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.130
Subtitling Motion Pictures.

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:34.010
Translating for Design and
Construction in Israel.

00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:37.440
Advancing Productivity Using
Voice Recognition.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.550
And one of my personal
favorites, Building Your Own

00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:43.950
Statistical Machine Translation
Systems.

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.770
Very interesting that there is
a session that is to teach

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:51.260
translators how to build
their own systems.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:53.580
So you can see that translation
is in all kinds of

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.650
different places.

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:57.820
And in the book, we talk about
translation of Harlequin

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:58.830
romance novels--

00:14:58.830 --> 00:15:00.770
something light-hearted--

00:15:00.770 --> 00:15:04.710
but translation also of holy
books and sacred texts, which

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:05.890
isn't so light-hearted.

00:15:05.890 --> 00:15:08.510
A much more serious topic.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:11.560
Translators and interpreters
are used in outer space by

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.710
astronauts to communicate with
engineers on the ground who

00:15:14.710 --> 00:15:17.360
speak other languages.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:17.970
And--

00:15:17.970 --> 00:15:20.840
on another lighthearted note--
if you go to the opera, you

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:23.755
might be handled a libretto that
has been translated so

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:26.490
that you can understand
what it says.

00:15:26.490 --> 00:15:29.560
Translators are out there
helping come up with exact

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:31.950
wording for peace treaties,
so that both sides

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:33.770
will agree to them.

00:15:33.770 --> 00:15:37.770
And they're also translating
video games.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:40.820
And translators are also
enabling us to use social

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:44.720
media platforms, which can be
used for fun, and also for

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.270
more serious things.

00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:49.150
Like revolutions, enabling
people to connect, enabling

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:53.330
people to communicate
and organize.

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:56.310
So, my next important point that
we make throughout the

00:15:56.310 --> 00:16:01.690
book is that translation
isn't easy.

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:04.650
Everybody here who has done that
can probably attest to

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.850
the fact that that's true.

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:11.520
So, a lot of people who are
working in this field have

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:12.230
this question.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:15.243
Well, if I'm bilingual, can
I become a translator?

00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:16.170
[LAUGHS]

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.650
We've all been asked
that, right?

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.790
But the best way to answer that
question, I think, is

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.570
that not everybody who knows
how to write can be a

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:25.360
professional writer.

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:27.400
Just because you cook dinner
every night doesn't make you a

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.930
professional chef.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:30.240
Just because you drive
a car doesn't

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.680
make you Mario Andretti.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.760
The same thing is true
for translators.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.970
Just because you know two
languages does not make you a

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:39.670
professional translator.

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:42.010
And the proof that we also
have to offer people that

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:46.480
translation isn't so easy
is that when people take

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.500
professional translation exams,
the passing rates are

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:52.110
usually very low--

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.700
around 20% for most exams for
translators and interpreters.

00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:59.000
So of 8 out of 10 bilingual
individuals who are failing

00:16:59.000 --> 00:16:59.470
these tests.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.590
That goes to show that it takes
more than just fluency

00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:03.960
in two languages to
be a translator.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.700
The reason for that is
because, of course,

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.550
words can be tricky.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.640
They can be misunderstood.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.660
They can be misconstrued.

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:12.050
They can be taken
out of context.

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:15.050
And that's just in
one language.

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:16.790
All we have to do is just
think of the classic

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:19.380
"telephone" game, where one
person whispers to the next,

00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:20.349
to the next, to the next.

00:17:20.349 --> 00:17:21.920
And by the end of it, we get a

00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.130
completely transformed message.

00:17:24.130 --> 00:17:25.380
And that's just in
one language.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:31.190
Language also never
stops evolving.

00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:34.800
It is completely unique
to each person.

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:37.550
My husband sent out an email
blast to a bunch of people to

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:39.130
let them know about the book.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.360
And he wrote, apologies
for the spousal spam.

00:17:43.910 --> 00:17:45.520
And I thought, oh, a new term.

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.000
OK, where did he get this?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.970
So I asked him, where
did you hear that?

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:51.690
And he said, oh, I
just made it up.

00:17:51.690 --> 00:17:54.240
That's just one example
of human creativity.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.820
We come up with new terms
all the time.

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:58.400
We coin new terms
all the time.

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.670
And that's why humans are so
necessary for translation.

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:04.920
But when we think about
spoken language,

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.880
it's much more complex.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.280
Obviously we have things like
tone of voice to worry about.

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.340
We have accent and
pronunciation.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.750
We even have things like
volume levels.

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:16.450
And, of course, translation of
spoken language interpretation

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:18.590
is affected by other things that
aren't necessarily within

00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:19.790
our control.

00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:21.620
So we have the equipment
that we're using.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:24.540
We have less predictable things
like background noise,

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:25.830
interference.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.710
Even if someone has a sore
throat, that can affect our

00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:29.700
ability to comprehend them.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.940
So there's all these other
variables that can interfere

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:35.300
with an interpreter's ability
to render information

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.000
accurately.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.540
So when we start to talk about
more than one language--

00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:42.430
we say in the book that
languages are like different

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:43.810
instruments.

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:44.790
They have different scales.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.440
They have different sounds.

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.340
Sometimes they don't even
have the same notes.

00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:52.590
You can't physically play the
same note in the same range or

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:54.535
the same octave on
one instrument

00:18:54.535 --> 00:18:56.580
as you can on another.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.310
So we actually wrote in the book
that poetry translation

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:02.426
is like playing a piano
sonata on a trombone.

00:19:02.426 --> 00:19:04.460
And I really think that's true,
because I'm currently

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:06.770
trying to translate some poetry
that was originally

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:07.640
written in Shuar.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.380
And to get that to come
into English is a

00:19:10.380 --> 00:19:13.150
pretty mighty challenge.

00:19:13.150 --> 00:19:16.490
I would also say it's not just
poetry translation that

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:18.480
presents this problem.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.740
How many of you saw in the
recent debates the Romney

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:24.430
quote that's been everywhere--
binders full of women.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:25.930
[LAUGHTER].

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:26.230
NATALY KELLY: OK.

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.767
How do you translate that?

00:19:27.767 --> 00:19:29.020
[LAUGHS]

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.410
It's not so easy to translate.

00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:32.750
So I wonder how this was
translated in the news for

00:19:32.750 --> 00:19:34.330
international media.

00:19:34.330 --> 00:19:36.600
But to make it even more
complicated, after this all

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.060
came out, I saw an
image that was

00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:41.000
shared, and it had Beyonce.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.300
And it said, if you like it,
then you better put three

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.540
rings on it.

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:48.380
And it was referring to
a three-ring binder.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.420
And I thought, this is a
translator's nightmare.

00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.450
Because not only do you have
to know something about

00:19:53.450 --> 00:19:56.140
Beyonce, you have to know
something about current events

00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.720
in American politics.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.430
You have to know about gender
relations and these things

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:03.500
that are happening in the news
with regard to women and

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.640
women's rights.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.450
And you have to know that, in
the United States, people use

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:10.440
three-ring binders, which aren't
necessarily used in

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.030
every country.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:13.030
Other countries have two-ring
binders, or four-ring binders,

00:20:13.030 --> 00:20:14.450
or six-ring binders.

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.910
So it's very complicated to try
to migrate that concept

00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:22.540
and that humor, especially
into another language.

00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:24.160
Terminology knowledge is
another reason that

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.210
translation is difficult.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.030
The average person uses about
4,000 to 5,000 words in

00:20:30.030 --> 00:20:33.820
English on a regular basis.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:35.400
People who are educated--

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:37.420
who've received a basic
education--

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.380
between 8,000 and
10,000 words.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.400
The professions that use the
widest vocabularies use more

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.815
than double that amount
of words.

00:20:45.815 --> 00:20:50.300
So how many words you think
translators have to know?

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:53.560
Well, many of them are crossing
many disciplines, and

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.320
many are going into more than
one language, so they are

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.520
obviously have to know this kind
of vocabulary in at least

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:00.770
two languages.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.070
So to give you another example
of why translation is so

00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:09.080
difficult, I thought I
would show you this.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.970
So, numbers don't need
translation, right?

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:12.420
You can just transfer
them across

00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:14.690
languages with no problem.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.044
Right?

00:21:16.044 --> 00:21:16.968
[LAUGHS]

00:21:16.968 --> 00:21:19.870
Does anyone know what these
numbers have in common, aside

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:22.360
from the fact that they're
on signs, these images?

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.970
How about if I show you this?

00:21:30.578 --> 00:21:34.710
Does anyone want to volunteer to
take Flight 666 and sit in

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:37.840
seat number 13?

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:40.580
These are bad luck numbers
in this culture, right?

00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:42.560
But they might not be bad luck
numbers in every culture.

00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:47.140
And all the numbers up here are
bad luck in some culture.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.060
So you can't just transfer
these numbers when you're

00:21:50.060 --> 00:21:53.100
translating a marketing
campaign, an advertising

00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.350
campaign, or maybe even
a flight number.

00:21:57.350 --> 00:22:00.110
To give you another example of
how difficult translation can

00:22:00.110 --> 00:22:03.030
be, I thought I would tell you
this little story about

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:05.010
President Carter.

00:22:05.010 --> 00:22:07.390
So President Carter, when
he was in office, became

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:08.990
accustomed to working
with interpreters.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:13.300
And after he left office, he
went to Japan, and he was

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:15.400
giving a talk at a school.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.410
And since he had worked with
interpreters many times

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.660
throughout his career, he
thought, OK, I'm gonna use a

00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.400
joke, but I know it's really
hard to interpret jokes.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.830
So I'm gonna make it short.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:27.020
I'm gonna keep it as a pretty
easy, short joke.

00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:32.820
So he told this joke, and the
audience erupted in laughter

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:34.740
after the interpreter rendered
it into Japanese.

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:36.363
They just died laughing.

00:22:36.363 --> 00:22:37.330
And he thought, wow.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:38.350
This is the best response.

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.400
I've ever had to a joke.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.920
I wonder what the interpreter's
secret is?

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.120
So he went up to the interpreter
and asked-- and at

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.590
first she didn't want to say.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.470
But then, he asked again, and
the interpreter said, "Mr.

00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:54.250
President, I told the audience,
President Carter

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:55.490
told a funny story.

00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.700
Everyone must laugh."

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:57.950
[LAUGHTER].

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.360
Made the interpreter's
life easier.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.810
It isn't easy to translate
humor, even if you're a

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.910
professional interpreter.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:16.620
So you can see how hard
translation and

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:19.130
interpreting can be.

00:23:19.130 --> 00:23:22.900
Now I'd like to talk a little
bit about the future.

00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.640
I believe that translation
is going to lead

00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.550
us into a new era.

00:23:28.550 --> 00:23:30.340
What do I mean by that?

00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:34.210
So I started to look in history
for other professions

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:37.000
that have made a dramatic
impact on the world.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.620
And one of the professions
that came up

00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:41.010
was this guy here.

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:42.850
Blacksmiths.

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:47.380
So, in a certain time period,
blacksmiths were seen kind of

00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:48.410
like magicians.

00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:49.540
They could do magical things.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.280
They could transform metal--

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:54.230
a hard surface-- and soften
it, and make it look

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:57.110
beautiful, and do really
important things with it.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.190
In fact, many people in villages
would come to them,

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:01.050
and they were doing all
kinds of things.

00:24:01.050 --> 00:24:04.075
Not only creating every
single nail--

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.710
I mean, it's hard to imagine
we couldn't just go

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:06.670
buy a box of nails.

00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:08.320
Each one had to be
hand crafted.

00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.780
But they were doing things
like dental work, and

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.030
veterinary work, and all
kinds of things.

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:15.000
Even warming the bread
and baking the

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.010
bread for the villages.

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.030
Because they were some of the
few people who knew how to

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:20.680
keep fires going.

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.540
So, blacksmiths played a
very important role.

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:25.440
And they're-- much like
translators, their work

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.330
touched all different
aspects of society.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.900
They were actually the lynchpin
of progress for the

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.770
Industrial Revolution.

00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:38.640
As needs became more complex,
so did the skills that were

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.970
needed by blacksmiths.

00:24:40.970 --> 00:24:44.170
And they were actually involved
in helping build the

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.970
machines that would eventually
replace their role.

00:24:48.970 --> 00:24:51.710
And they gave rise to a new way
of life, a new economy, a

00:24:51.710 --> 00:24:52.290
new society.

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.750
A whole new way of life.

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.360
And that role actually evolved
into many other professions

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.020
that did not exist previously
in history.

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.910
So, things like welders,
machinists, pipefitters.

00:25:03.910 --> 00:25:06.570
And there were also a lot of
blacksmiths that went on to

00:25:06.570 --> 00:25:08.800
invent great things using
their skills and their

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:12.830
knowledge, like Studebaker,
John Deere, Henry Ford.

00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:14.080
These were all blacksmiths.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:18.890
So even after their role was
transformed, they continued to

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.710
make major contributions.

00:25:22.710 --> 00:25:23.580
So, I want to talk--

00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:25.920
I'm gonna come back to the
idea of blacksmiths and

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:28.710
translators and what they
have in common.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:31.270
But the question that you're
probably asking is-- because

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:33.130
blacksmiths kind
of faded away--

00:25:33.130 --> 00:25:36.520
does that mean translators are
also going to fade away?

00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.670
Well, here's where I think
there's a difference between

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:43.130
what blacksmiths did and what
translators are doing.

00:25:43.130 --> 00:25:44.560
So the big question is--
that everybody

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:45.910
asks me all the time--

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:47.753
is will human translators
be replaced?

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:53.220
I think when you compare them
to blacksmiths, you can ask

00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:56.120
people to use identical nails,
you can standardize things

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:58.220
like railroad ties.

00:25:58.220 --> 00:26:00.820
But can you ask people to
use identical words?

00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:03.020
Can you ask everybody to
speak the same way?

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.660
Can you ask people to mass
produce content?

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:08.190
Can it be like a factory
assembly line?

00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:11.570
How much content can
be mass produced?

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.820
And how much has to
be customized?

00:26:14.820 --> 00:26:18.560
So, let's take a look at what
some of the data says.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.630
So, some of the stats I'm gonna
show you here come from

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.740
Common Sense Advisory.

00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:25.200
So, the market today
is worth more than

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.500
$33 billion US dollars--

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.950
the market for language services
and technology.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.220
That's as of 2012.

00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:36.560
And the market is growing
at a rate of 12.17%.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.050
Now, the market has continued
to grow steadily throughout

00:26:40.050 --> 00:26:41.530
the recession.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.220
Unlike many industries, this
market has continued to grow.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:46.580
Now, the growth did slow down
a bit during the global

00:26:46.580 --> 00:26:47.660
economic downturn.

00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:51.160
But it continued to grow, and
historically has always grown

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:54.810
yearly in double-digit
growth rates.

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:58.260
There are more than 26,000
translation agencies or

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.270
companies offering translation
services throughout the world.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:04.400
And our estimates tend to be
pretty conservative compared

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.250
to some of the other government
estimates

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:08.800
that are out there.

00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.170
So, North America is not the
only important area of the

00:27:13.170 --> 00:27:14.590
world when it comes
to translation.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:16.160
In fact, it's not even
the biggest.

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.200
Europe is quite a bit larger,
and North America makes up

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.560
less than a third.

00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.420
But translation is a global
industry, as you can see here.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:26.450
And the dynamics and the
distribution of how this

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.900
market is changing are different
every single year

00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:30.510
that we look at it.

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:31.720
Asia is rising.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.140
We're seeing North America
play less of a

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:34.630
role than in the past.

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.120
So, these things are changing
year by year.

00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.780
But this market is made up of
many, many services, not just

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:43.350
translation.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:45.170
Obviously, software
localization--

00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.000
which a lot of you are
interested in--

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.880
on-site interpreting, website
globalization, multimedia

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:50.570
localization--

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.110
all of these are encompassed
within this broader market.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.310
But translation is by far the
biggest service, because it's

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:00.060
used by pretty much every type
of organization that

00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.760
you can think of.

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.110
Demand for translation
is growing.

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:09.360
We did a study of Fortune 500
companies, and the vast

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.090
majority told us that their
translation volumes have

00:28:12.090 --> 00:28:13.420
increased, and that
they expect them

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:14.800
to continue to increase.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.600
Their content volumes
were increasing at

00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.110
an even faster pace.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.990
So the potential demand for
translation is enormous.

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:26.240
Some studies show that there are
2.5 quintillion bytes of

00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:27.370
data-- of information--

00:28:27.370 --> 00:28:30.490
coming into existence
every single day.

00:28:30.490 --> 00:28:34.820
Translation providers are
converting a tiny, tiny

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:35.520
fraction of that--

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.850
0.00000067%.

00:28:39.850 --> 00:28:42.640
That's how much they are
converting every day.

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:45.770
So, if even just a tiny fraction
of that information

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:49.840
is useful for translation
purposes, that signifies

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:53.280
enormous potential
for translation.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.460
What a lot of people don't
realize, when they talk about

00:28:55.460 --> 00:28:59.430
machine translation replacing
humans, is that human

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:01.870
translators already use
translation software and

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:03.090
translation technology.

00:29:03.090 --> 00:29:06.760
And the idea of leveraging
past content is already

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.770
widespread.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:10.270
This is something that has
exists for decades.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:13.910
So the average translation
agency translates about 43,000

00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:14.990
words per day.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.290
And freelancers have an average
of a little less than

00:29:17.290 --> 00:29:19.360
2,700 words per day.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.710
We asked freelancers and
translation agencies, how many

00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:25.760
words are brand new words
translated for the first time

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.650
without using any translation
memory software?

00:29:29.650 --> 00:29:32.620
The rate for both was
almost identical.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.000
It's about 60%, which means
that 40% of what they're

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.140
translating is using translation
memory--

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.770
is relying on past translation
work that's already been done

00:29:42.770 --> 00:29:44.340
in the past.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.410
So when we talk about
technology replacing

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.320
translation, think about
these figures.

00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:53.250
Technology already is helping
replace about 40% of the human

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.080
translation work that used
to be done in the past.

00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.560
It's just being done by a
slightly different technology

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.920
than automatic translation.

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:07.350
So, is technology going to
replace human translators?

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.210
This is a question we get
asked all the time.

00:30:09.210 --> 00:30:11.820
And I always ask, has accounting
software made

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:14.320
accountants obsolete?

00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.830
Has medical diagnostic software

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:17.980
made doctors obsolete?

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.660
Has legal software made
lawyers obsolete?

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:23.220
So, why do we think that
translation software would

00:30:23.220 --> 00:30:24.380
make translators obsolete?

00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.970
Especially when we've been
using translation

00:30:25.970 --> 00:30:28.370
software for decades.

00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:32.170
That's a question that I think
all of us should ask.

00:30:32.170 --> 00:30:36.330
These fields are constantly
evolving, and so is the field

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:37.130
of translation.

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:39.580
And as I mentioned, those 26,000
companies, they're not

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:41.050
just made up of translators.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:42.780
They're made up of salespeople,
they're made up

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.860
of marketing directors, they're
made up of software

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:47.340
engineers, they're made up of
all kinds of people-- human

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:48.800
resources staff.

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.630
Many, many people are employed
in this industry.

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.140
It's not just translators that
would have to be replaced.

00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:02.760
Language is categorized as the
epitome of human intelligence.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:05.980
So, how many of you are familiar
with the Turing test?

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:07.420
Many of you.

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:12.190
So the Turing test looks at the
machine's ability to use

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:13.840
language as a human would.

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.820
And this is considered to be the
ultimate test of whether

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:19.290
machines can have human
intelligence.

00:31:19.290 --> 00:31:21.850
So, the questions that we can
ask ourselves when it comes

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:25.450
to, can a machine replace
a human translator?

00:31:25.450 --> 00:31:29.020
Can a machine use language
like a human can?

00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.520
Can a machine debate politics?

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:34.290
Can a machine write poetry?

00:31:34.290 --> 00:31:36.960
Can a machine flirt
with someone?

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.290
Can a machine tell jokes?

00:31:40.290 --> 00:31:42.550
In just one language,
can a machine do

00:31:42.550 --> 00:31:44.510
any of those things?

00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:46.820
Maybe we can get to a point
where a machine can do some of

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:49.560
those things in one language,
but we're not just dealing

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.520
with one language.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.900
We're dealing with thousands
of languages.

00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.910
So the answer that we need to
remember, when we're asked

00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:02.860
this question of can machines
replace humans in translation,

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.430
is that we still have
a long way to go.

00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:06.670
A really long way.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.860
Google Translate is available
today in 65

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.080
languages plus English.

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:14.240
But there are between 6,000
and 7,000 languages in the

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:16.340
world today.

00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.490
And there's just one big problem
when it comes to

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.040
thinking about extending Google
Translate into all of

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.290
those languages.

00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.870
Only 2,261 have writing
systems.

00:32:28.870 --> 00:32:32.990
The rest of them are
spoken or signed.

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:35.000
There are hundreds of
sign languages.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.960
There are 18 in Latin
America alone.

00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.350
So written translation
is really not enough.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.510
It's hardly sufficient.

00:32:43.510 --> 00:32:46.070
The majority of the languages
are spoken or signed.

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:51.810
So, even if we could address
all of those issues, and we

00:32:51.810 --> 00:32:55.260
can imagine that we can do
automatic translation for

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.610
spoken, and written, and signed
language-- and all of

00:32:58.610 --> 00:33:00.070
those languages--

00:33:00.070 --> 00:33:01.880
there's one more problem.

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.950
We would have to hit a big Pause
button on human language

00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:06.680
development.

00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.700
We would say, freeze,
everybody!

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:09.890
No more jokes.

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.330
No more plays on words.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:12.840
No more new invented terms.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.400
Everybody has to stop.

00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.530
And we are going to mine all
text ever produced in every

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:19.260
single language.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:22.080
And we are going to analyze
all language variations

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.880
currently spoken by every
human being on Earth.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.650
And then we're going to
translate it into and out of

00:33:27.650 --> 00:33:33.220
6,000 to 7,000 languages that
exist throughout the world.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.490
As soon as we hit that Play
button again, the need for

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:37.740
human translators returns.

00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.710
So, this is an image of a
blacksmith that I took just a

00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:48.960
couple of years ago, in a very
small town in rural Illinois,

00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.460
near where I grew up--

00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:55.690
in New Salem, which is a
Lincoln Heritage site.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:58.770
And this is a working
blacksmith.

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.900
I was surprised to learn that
there are still about 11,000

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.600
working blacksmiths in the
United States today, similar

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:08.090
to the number of professional
translators that are members

00:34:08.090 --> 00:34:11.320
of the American Translators
Association.

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:14.830
Now, not all of them are
full-time blacksmiths that are

00:34:14.830 --> 00:34:15.880
paid to do that work.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.900
And a lot of what they're doing
is custom work, custom

00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:20.440
forging for--

00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:24.060
making little brackets to hang
curtains and doorknobs and

00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.310
things like that.

00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:28.639
A lot of that work is very
artisanal, very specialized,

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:29.929
very customized.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.489
But some of them
do still exist.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.219
As I mentioned, many of
the blacksmiths--

00:34:35.219 --> 00:34:37.100
this field evolved, the
profession evolved, just like

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.179
the profession of translation
is evolving.

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:42.389
But some still do this work the
very same way that it was

00:34:42.389 --> 00:34:45.120
done many, many years ago.

00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:47.889
So, do translators really have
anything in common with

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:49.219
blacksmiths?

00:34:49.219 --> 00:34:51.580
Well, translators don't
work in total

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.230
isolation, like I mentioned.

00:34:53.230 --> 00:34:56.409
They're not separate from
all of these other jobs.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:00.190
They are part of an ecosystem,
part of a community.

00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:04.190
And it's unlikely that we will
ever be able to mass produce

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:07.290
content the way that you can
mass produce a box of nails in

00:35:07.290 --> 00:35:08.360
a standard way.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:11.930
And as I mentioned, 40% of
current translation work

00:35:11.930 --> 00:35:14.020
leverages past work already.

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:17.160
So, if we are in a process of
replacing human translators--

00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:20.100
we're already in the midst
of that process--

00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.590
60% of the work that translators
are doing today

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:26.330
still entails custom forging,
if we want to use the

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.190
blacksmith metaphor.

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:32.220
So, this profession is already
in the midst of evolving.

00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:35.160
So, are translators the
new blacksmiths?

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.850
Well, I believe that much like
blacksmiths pushed us into the

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:41.450
industrial age, into the
Industrial Revolution,

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:45.840
translation is pushing us past
the information age and we are

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:47.690
moving now into the information

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:50.290
transformation age.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:53.950
Whatever shape the next
revolution we have takes--

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.440
a lot of people have referred
to this as the Information

00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.290
Revolution--

00:35:58.290 --> 00:35:59.910
translation has to
play a part.

00:35:59.910 --> 00:36:03.480
We can't talk about access to
information unless we talk

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.030
about translation, unless
we talk about

00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:08.270
the language component.

00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:11.140
So translation will be critical
in helping us achieve

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:12.800
a better quality of life.

00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.580
Now, we did a study recently
at Common Sense Advisory on

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:17.600
the need for translation
in Africa.

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.740
And this was a study that was
commissioned by Translators

00:36:19.740 --> 00:36:21.460
Without Borders.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:26.230
And we were surprised to see
that so many respondents told

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:30.170
us that translation would effect
virtually every aspect

00:36:30.170 --> 00:36:31.030
of their life.

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:36.460
Political inclusion, health
information, information about

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:38.600
how to prevent conflict.

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.750
People even said that they
thought it would reduce-- more

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:42.480
access to translated information
would reduce

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.280
violent conflict.

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:47.610
They also said that it would
prevent the loss of life, of

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:48.640
loved ones.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:51.130
Just having information
to basic--

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:53.730
access to basic information
about how to prevent certain

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:56.700
health concerns and health
conditions would have had a

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.430
tremendous impact.

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:00.710
So when we think about the
Industrial Revolution, how it

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:03.680
led us to a new quality of life,
I truly believe that

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:06.300
translation, for many people who
don't have much access to

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:09.410
information, especially in their
native languages, can

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.700
definitely impact their lives.

00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:15.040
We have data that
shows us this.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.210
I don't think that content
is king anymore.

00:37:19.210 --> 00:37:22.240
I believe that the ability
to transform content, to

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:25.550
intelligently use that
information, to customize it,

00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:30.290
is truly the new king
or maybe queen.

00:37:30.290 --> 00:37:35.560
Speaking of kings, I was
looking for stories and

00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:37.970
information about blacksmiths,
and I came across this story

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:39.400
about King Arthur.

00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.400
So, King Arthur summoned all the
artisans and asked them to

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.080
explain why their work was
important to building Camelot.

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.280
He asked them to justify
their position.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.120
So he brought in the tailor, he
brought in the carpenter,

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.490
he brought in the
stonemason, the

00:37:52.490 --> 00:37:54.220
goldsmith, and other artisans.

00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:56.930
And each of them made a very
strong case to him for why

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.200
their work was important.

00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:02.280
And he asked them where
they got their tools.

00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:07.000
And each one of them said,
the blacksmith.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.950
So Arthur asked the
blacksmith, and

00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:12.736
who makes your tools?

00:38:12.736 --> 00:38:17.300
And the blacksmith said, Sire,
I make my own tools.

00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.430
That is my craft.

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:23.370
Now, remember that American
Translators Association

00:38:23.370 --> 00:38:26.170
session that I pointed out,
where translators are being

00:38:26.170 --> 00:38:28.320
taught to create their own
statistical machine

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.480
translation engines?

00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.560
Talk about making
your own tools

00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:35.810
Is that our craft?

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.360
Is that the craft of translators
for the future?

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:42.046
"And the kindly King moved the
humble blacksmith to the head

00:38:42.046 --> 00:38:45.830
of his table, as he had made
all the tools for all the

00:38:45.830 --> 00:38:50.410
trades." I truly believe that
translators are in the process

00:38:50.410 --> 00:38:53.200
of making their own information
tools, whether

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:55.490
that is contributing to their
own translation memory

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.510
databases, or simply producing
translations that are being

00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.790
mined by statistical machine
translation engines.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.200
And these are tools that can
truly open up a door to human

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:09.050
rights and to a civilization
that we can't

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:10.140
even describe today.

00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:12.990
We haven't even imagined what
it will be like for so many

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.610
people who don't have access
to information, and can't

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:18.560
understand what it's like to
benefit from that information

00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:20.110
in a language that they
can truly understand.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.850
So, I've told you about the
book and the fact that I

00:39:25.850 --> 00:39:29.150
believe that translation not
only shapes our lives and

00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:32.580
transforms the world, but I also
believe that translation

00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.540
truly defines our future.

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:39.960
I think when we talk about
access to information, we

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:42.090
really have to think about
access to information as a

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.160
human right.

00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:47.630
And until we can unlock that
information for those 6,000 to

00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:52.660
7,000 languages, we truly are
not providing equal access to

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:54.860
everybody who needs it.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.320
So that's why I believe
translation matters, and

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.340
that's why I believe it will
have an important effect on

00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.170
the way we live our lives.

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:04.800
Not only today, but
in the future.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.495
So, with that, I will be happy
to take your questions

00:40:08.495 --> 00:40:09.745
[APPLAUSE].

00:40:16.130 --> 00:40:19.920
MALE SPEAKER: So, I think I want
to put together a couple

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.770
thoughts, because you covered
a lot of ground.

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:26.000
But the 6,000 to 7,000
languages--

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.340
I think that includes
a fair number of

00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:30.780
dead and archaic languages?

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:31.050
NATALY KELLY: No.

00:40:31.050 --> 00:40:33.170
Those are all languages that are
spoken, but many of them

00:40:33.170 --> 00:40:34.320
are endangered.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:34.700
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:35.950
NATALY KELLY: Mm-hmm.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:40.660
MALE SPEAKER: Also, the
statistics that are based on

00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:44.910
the volume of translation, a lot
of that is driven by the

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.140
amount of content that's being
translated, not necessarily

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:49.870
the demands.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:53.480
Because I think most of us in
this room know that we have a

00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:57.360
number of companies that like
to just translate whatever

00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:00.060
there have gotten, don't always
pay attention to the

00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:03.820
quality of their content,
and so forth.

00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.320
I see pressure in
many countries--

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.680
China, India--

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:10.400
as a part of solving--

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.880
and also in Africa--

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:16.730
solving their literacy issues
and their communication issues

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:18.570
by moving towards--

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:22.540
well, first, education, but then
also standardization and

00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:26.630
centralization of their
population's ability to speak

00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:27.820
fewer languages.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:29.880
Moving in that direction.

00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:33.700
So, between that and the number
of languages that are

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:38.810
dying every year, it would seem
that there's also a trend

00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:44.370
that is somehow ignored in
your discussion of having

00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.490
actually fewer working
languages in

00:41:47.490 --> 00:41:49.480
the world over time.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.710
Not that translation
would go away.

00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:55.120
But you can't just use the
numbers that are based on

00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:57.990
content and costs--

00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:59.180
cost demand.

00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:01.840
So I wonder if you'd address
some of those points.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:03.290
NATALY KELLY: Sure.

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:07.060
So, this is a common question
that we're asked a lot.

00:42:07.060 --> 00:42:09.480
Are global languages
taking over and

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:11.420
making some of those--

00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:15.530
language number 2,497
and so on--

00:42:15.530 --> 00:42:16.580
less important?

00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:19.470
Because more people can
use an interlanguage--

00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.970
one of these large
global languages.

00:42:21.970 --> 00:42:26.020
What is happening is that a
lot of communities now can

00:42:26.020 --> 00:42:29.100
communicate much more easily
than they could in the past.

00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:33.540
So, yes, there is a push for
literacy, even in languages

00:42:33.540 --> 00:42:35.400
that don't have a
writing system.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:40.330
And there's this-- in my view--
archaic desire to force

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.850
literacy upon people,
when in some cases

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:45.710
that's not that necessary.

00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:48.180
If they can communicate with
video-based, audio-based

00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.990
information, why do they
need to be forced to

00:42:50.990 --> 00:42:52.500
have a writing system?

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:57.050
Maybe it's better to use audio
and video information, where a

00:42:57.050 --> 00:43:01.270
lot more nuance and a lot more
information-- it's much richer

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.660
information to begin with.

00:43:02.660 --> 00:43:04.940
So maybe they can
skip that step.

00:43:04.940 --> 00:43:08.500
It used to be that writing was
very important, because that

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:12.030
was a fast way to disseminate
lots of information.

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:15.090
But now we can do the same thing
much more efficiently,

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:18.010
in a lot of ways, with
video information.

00:43:18.010 --> 00:43:20.480
So one thing that we do at
Common Sense Advisory is look

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:23.250
at the stats of languages on
the web, and which ones are

00:43:23.250 --> 00:43:24.540
becoming more important.

00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:27.190
Every year we do a large-scale
study on this.

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:29.100
And one thing that we're
noticing is that these less

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.450
common languages are becoming
more and more

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:32.280
important each year.

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.920
And we have that long tail of
languages effect that I'm sure

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:36.740
many of you are familiar with.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:40.240
So, yes, there are efforts in
many countries to standardize.

00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:45.010
And there are efforts to kind
of go toward one language,

00:43:45.010 --> 00:43:47.920
gravitate toward a language of
power, a language that is

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:52.080
traditionally the language of
people in society that are

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.510
usually the ones who
hold the resources.

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:57.300
But there are also a lot of
efforts to preserve native

00:43:57.300 --> 00:44:00.470
languages, and to allow people
to use the language that's

00:44:00.470 --> 00:44:02.260
most familiar to them.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:04.350
So, I don't think that that
trend is going to go away.

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:06.370
I think it's only going
to increase.

00:44:06.370 --> 00:44:08.030
Because all of the companies--

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:10.660
I know many of you work for
large global companies--

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:13.680
and who are you competing with
when you're going into some of

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:14.300
those markets?

00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:16.360
You're competing with
local competitors,

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:17.460
for the most part.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:21.030
And a lot of them are founded
by people who speak some of

00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:22.170
those minority languages.

00:44:22.170 --> 00:44:25.480
And many of them will have
bilingual websites, and

00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.530
websites in some of
those languages.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:29.740
So, every country is slightly
different, of course, with

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.100
regard to their language policy,
and with regard to

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.950
their preferences, and with
regard to who's in power at

00:44:33.950 --> 00:44:35.000
the moment.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.340
But I see a lot of small
languages fighting.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.650
And I see a lot of them
creating content.

00:44:41.650 --> 00:44:44.580
And really, if they have the
operating systems to be able

00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:47.170
to create content, that is what
is opening the door for

00:44:47.170 --> 00:44:50.810
them to be able to do that, at
least in a digital fashion.

00:44:50.810 --> 00:44:53.130
So I'm not sure I answered your
question exactly, but

00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.655
it's a complicated one.

00:44:54.655 --> 00:44:57.030
[LAUGHS]

00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:58.250
You have a follow up?

00:44:58.250 --> 00:44:59.380
MALE SPEAKER: Nataly, oh--

00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:00.510
I just lost the mic.

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:01.840
NATALY KELLY: Oh, OK.

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:02.475
[LAUGHS].

00:45:02.475 --> 00:45:03.785
MALE SPEAKER: Nataly, thank
you for that presentation.

00:45:03.785 --> 00:45:04.110
NATALY KELLY: Thanks, Dex.

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:06.070
MALE SPEAKER: It was very
thoughtful and actually

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.740
elegant, in my opinion.

00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:09.100
So thank you.

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:13.420
My question is about the term
"translator." When you talk

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.480
about translator, can you give
us some thoughts on community?

00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:19.030
Is it an individual person?

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.410
Is it a community?

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:24.200
And what do these generative
creative types--

00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.240
what's the profile?

00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.930
NATALY KELLY: Mm-hmm.

00:45:26.930 --> 00:45:28.970
Well, this is a complicated
question.

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:32.090
I just wrote an article on this
exact topic, about how

00:45:32.090 --> 00:45:36.250
translators are defining
themselves, and the reality

00:45:36.250 --> 00:45:39.290
is, even the lay public will
call an interpreter a

00:45:39.290 --> 00:45:40.430
translator.

00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:43.640
And even someone who works in
transcreation is usually

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.520
referred to as a translator,
even if what they're doing

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:47.800
really isn't translation.

00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.330
So, the word translation--

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.190
I've used this term in this
presentation, because I have

00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:56.290
been using the overarching term
related to transferring

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.280
information from one language
into another.

00:45:58.280 --> 00:46:00.220
And that's the basic definition
that you'll find in

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:02.170
most dictionaries.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:04.250
What we're finding is-- in some
of the studies that we're

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:05.880
doing at Common Sense
Advisory--

00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:09.260
is that this word, and what
it means, is changing

00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:10.510
drastically.

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:12.980
So we just a recent
study on pricing.

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:15.490
And the big finding was that
the price of translation--

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.890
average price of translation
has dropped.

00:46:17.890 --> 00:46:19.460
Nobody likes to hear that.

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:20.890
Don't shoot the messenger.

00:46:20.890 --> 00:46:22.770
Well, maybe some people do like
it, if you're buying a

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.250
translation.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:25.690
But nobody on the supply side
likes to hear that.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.830
But what we found is that the
reason for that is that this

00:46:29.830 --> 00:46:31.810
field is becoming
more diverse.

00:46:31.810 --> 00:46:32.530
So now--

00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:35.200
it used to be many years ago,
if you bought translation by

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.380
the word, you would get
translation, editing and

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:38.620
proofing including
in the price per

00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:40.690
word, included in that.

00:46:40.690 --> 00:46:43.400
Now if you buy translation,
you're only getting

00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.530
translation from a lot of
vendors, and you're separately

00:46:46.530 --> 00:46:48.360
paying for editing, and you're
separately paying for

00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.740
proofing, and you're separately
paying for

00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:51.370
translation memory management.

00:46:51.370 --> 00:46:54.000
And you're separately paying for
hosting your translation

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.550
memory files in perpetuity.

00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.190
You're separately paying for
terminology management.

00:46:59.190 --> 00:47:01.590
You're separately paying
for project management.

00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:03.990
Many of these things are
being broken up now.

00:47:03.990 --> 00:47:07.060
So the field is getting more
diverse in many senses.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:10.630
And buyers are starting to
pay separately for that.

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.290
So it's not necessarily
that the price

00:47:12.290 --> 00:47:14.380
is dropping on average.

00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:17.420
It's that many more things
are being built in--

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.490
were-- used to be built into
that price per word that

00:47:19.490 --> 00:47:22.480
aren't any more.

00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:26.310
So there's a lot that goes into
that word translation.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:27.640
And we're tracking that.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:30.210
And we actually are doing a
study on production models, to

00:47:30.210 --> 00:47:33.430
see how different language
service providers are managing

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.080
that process.

00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:35.650
And now, we're starting
to see more

00:47:35.650 --> 00:47:37.830
collaborative forms emerge.

00:47:37.830 --> 00:47:40.630
I talked to a language service
provider the other day, and

00:47:40.630 --> 00:47:43.250
they told me that they don't
have a TEP process-- a

00:47:43.250 --> 00:47:45.070
Translate, Edit,
Proof process.

00:47:45.070 --> 00:47:46.480
What they're doing
is they have two

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.260
translators who work together.

00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.060
Neither--

00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:50.150
there's no hierarchy.

00:47:50.150 --> 00:47:52.940
They're a pair, kind of like
pair programming, and they are

00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:54.520
pair translating.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:56.250
They are truly pair translating,
and working as a

00:47:56.250 --> 00:47:58.110
team, and translating
together.

00:47:58.110 --> 00:48:00.400
And so they both have to be
comfortable with the output.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.380
They both have to be comfortable
with the quality.

00:48:02.380 --> 00:48:05.490
But it saves them the quality
assurance steps, because

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:07.200
they're doing it from the start
and they're doing it

00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.330
together, and they're allowing
collaboration.

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:11.430
And all of you are probably
familiar with crowdsource

00:48:11.430 --> 00:48:12.860
translation, community
translation.

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:14.510
We've written a ton
about that.

00:48:14.510 --> 00:48:17.230
That's another form that's less
common, but is still a

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:20.225
form that is changing the
way we view translation.

00:48:24.198 --> 00:48:25.570
Yes.

00:48:25.570 --> 00:48:26.410
MIKE: My--

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:27.340
sorry.

00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:28.020
My name's Mike.

00:48:28.020 --> 00:48:30.610
Thank you for your time, and
it was a very interesting

00:48:30.610 --> 00:48:32.070
presentation.

00:48:32.070 --> 00:48:33.185
I just have a quick question.

00:48:33.185 --> 00:48:35.440
It's pretty basic, actually.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:38.140
Does highly technical language,
such as legalese or

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.780
medical jargon, change
as quickly

00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:42.320
as colloquial language?

00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:46.500
And if so, in your research,
have you found it easier--

00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:50.240
or even possible-- to
standardize that content?

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:54.130
As opposed to humor and other
things like intoxicado as you

00:48:54.130 --> 00:48:57.010
mentioned early on in
your presentation.

00:48:57.010 --> 00:48:59.640
NATALY KELLY: That type of
terminology tends to evolve

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.790
even more quickly.

00:49:00.790 --> 00:49:01.970
It depends on the field.

00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:05.150
But I recently was at a
conference for the World Bank,

00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:08.270
and I was mentioning that the
standard rate of productivity

00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:09.900
for translators for decades--

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:12.315
since I entered the profession
at least-- was always 2,500

00:49:12.315 --> 00:49:13.820
words per day.

00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.940
And the translators from the
World Bank told me, well, our

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.920
guideline is about 2,000 words
per day, because we have to

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:24.990
translate all kinds of new
financial terminology that's

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:30.000
being invented on the fly, and
new program names, new offices

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.300
that are being created in
different countries, and

00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:33.260
things like that.

00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:35.810
So, it really depends
on the field.

00:49:35.810 --> 00:49:38.670
But that kind of terminology
does really represent a

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.840
challenge for translators,
because many times they are

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:44.120
inventing the terms and
in another language.

00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.460
So it takes a lot of research.

00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.240
It takes how can I come up with
the perfect word for this

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:51.490
that's going to be used from
now on by this official

00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:53.550
government body like
the World Bank?

00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.320
So, that kind of terminology--

00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:56.976
and in some fields--
and it depends on

00:49:56.976 --> 00:49:58.120
the language as well.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:00.810
Because some languages have
pretty strict rules about new

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:02.490
terminology entering
the language, at

00:50:02.490 --> 00:50:04.010
least in written form.

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:06.510
And they tend to be a little
bit less responsive to what

00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:08.460
people are actually using on the
ground, if they have all

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.880
those kinds of bodies dictating
what people

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.460
can and can't say.

00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:15.450
So you can kind of tell what
side I'm on when it comes to

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:16.650
those kinds of organizations.

00:50:16.650 --> 00:50:19.000
But it depends on
many factors.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.350
But the short answer is that the
specialized groups tend to

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:26.230
evolve their specialized
areas more quickly.

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:30.030
MALE SPEAKER: In the course of
looking at scenarios for

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.670
companies that have several
target languages--

00:50:32.670 --> 00:50:32.870
NATALY KELLY: Mm-hmm.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.500
MALE SPEAKER: Did you look
into any interest in

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:40.180
simplified or pivot English
as a intermediate step?

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.770
And can you comment on that?

00:50:41.770 --> 00:50:43.340
NATALY KELLY: Yeah.

00:50:43.340 --> 00:50:46.320
Well, we haven't looked
specifically at pivot English

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.860
or simplified English.

00:50:47.860 --> 00:50:50.330
But we have looked at English
as a pivot language.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:52.470
So for those of you who are not
familiar, what's happening

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:54.810
is, because the volume of
translation has been

00:50:54.810 --> 00:50:57.410
increasing for a lot of
languages and the translation

00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:59.450
profession has not evolved
that quickly in some

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:00.200
countries--

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:01.270
China is one example.

00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:03.640
India is another.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:06.550
What's happening is a lot of
companies have to translate

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:09.260
into English first and
then into Chinese.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.600
So there aren't enough
translators between, say,

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.880
Italian and Chinese.

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.480
So they're going Italian into
English, English into Chinese.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.670
And this is happening for
other languages as well.

00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:21.660
So yes, we have looked
at that.

00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:24.940
And it's problematic
for many reasons.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.120
One, the cost of doing that
is twice as expensive.

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:32.060
And second, the quality degrades
when you have to

00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:34.400
translate a translation.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:35.820
So that is a concern.

00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:37.220
We've written quite
a bit about that.

00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:39.080
And it is a problem.

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.510
But what we've written about
is that the fields--

00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:42.190
the professions--

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:43.870
are not maturing fast enough.

00:51:43.870 --> 00:51:45.150
They're not keeping up.

00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:46.880
And it's a difficult problem.

00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.940
Because, in markets like
China, when I talk to

00:51:48.940 --> 00:51:51.870
companies in China, they tell
me, well, if I find someone

00:51:51.870 --> 00:51:54.140
who has good enough English to
be a translator, or good

00:51:54.140 --> 00:51:56.860
enough German or French, they
go and specialize in

00:51:56.860 --> 00:52:00.330
international business, where
they can make more money.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:04.580
And some translation agencies in
China actually told me that

00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:07.210
they can't keep translators long
enough, because some of

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:09.080
them will work for a few months,
they make enough money

00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:11.580
that they go on vacation for a
couple months, and then they

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:12.130
never come back.

00:52:12.130 --> 00:52:14.870
And then they go work for
a different agency.

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:17.840
And others are saying that they
can't find enough talent

00:52:17.840 --> 00:52:20.490
that's willing to work for the
wages that they can offer,

00:52:20.490 --> 00:52:24.490
because their standards are
higher, and their customers

00:52:24.490 --> 00:52:25.850
expect better quality.

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:27.600
So, it is a real challenge.

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.890
We're seeing that for
many different

00:52:28.890 --> 00:52:31.370
languages around the world.

00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.780
FEMALE SPEAKER: Hey.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:33.070
NATALY KELLY: Hey.

00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:35.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you share
with us the most interesting

00:52:35.270 --> 00:52:37.700
or surprising reaction you've
had to your book?

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.532
NATALY KELLY: [LAUGHS]

00:52:40.532 --> 00:52:43.570
You know, that's a
good question.

00:52:43.570 --> 00:52:47.830
I think the most surprising
reaction I've had--

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:49.270
well, there's a few things
that-- there are a few that

00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:51.880
come to mind.

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.240
I think the most interesting
thing was speaking at the

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.960
Jimmy Carter Library.

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.340
And a lot of people came to that
who had no background in

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:00.280
translation whatsoever.

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:02.590
In fact, it's kind of a treat
for me to speak to people who

00:53:02.590 --> 00:53:04.600
actually deal with translation,
understand a lot

00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.810
about translation.

00:53:05.810 --> 00:53:10.050
In that group-- in most of the
public talks and signings that

00:53:10.050 --> 00:53:11.110
I've been doing--

00:53:11.110 --> 00:53:13.400
a lot of people are coming just
from the general public.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.950
People in the bookstore
who just wander over.

00:53:15.950 --> 00:53:18.970
And I think that's
really exciting.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.090
It has been surprising for me
how many people are interested

00:53:21.090 --> 00:53:21.770
in the topic.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.060
And one person actually told me
that they found a copy of

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:28.680
my book in a Barnes and Noble
in Louisville, Kentucky

00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:31.290
[LAUGHS], and that really
made me happy.

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.520
Because I think the message that
we need to get out is to

00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.850
all the people who don't work
in languages, and all the

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.770
people who are mono-lingual and
don't know a thing about

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.230
all other languages.

00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:43.730
If they can start to take an
interest and start to see that

00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:46.150
translation affects their lives,
I think there'll be a

00:53:46.150 --> 00:53:48.660
lot more support for
the industry.

00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:52.380
And in writing this book, our
big goal was to really make it

00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:54.810
like Freakonomics
for translation.

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:57.430
You know, take a topic that
people think is dry and boring

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:58.790
and not really--

00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.760
doesn't really affect me, and
to make it fun and exciting,

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:05.430
and make it seem real, and make
it seem like it affects

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:06.650
their lives, because it does.

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:07.490
[LAUGHS].

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:10.400
So, I don't have any
real shockers.

00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:16.010
But that's pretty much my
impressions so far.

00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:17.700
Thank you.

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:19.040
MALE SPEAKER: That reminds me.

00:54:19.040 --> 00:54:22.020
It's not a surprise, but I
noticed one of your most

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.420
recent Tweets that you got
a thank-you letter from

00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:28.270
President Carter and Rosalynn
for your nice memories of them

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.920
in the book.

00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:30.757
NATALY KELLY: Yes.

00:54:30.757 --> 00:54:31.890
MALE SPEAKER: That was--

00:54:31.890 --> 00:54:33.350
NATALY KELLY: That was-- well,
I guess that was a shock.

00:54:33.350 --> 00:54:33.890
Yes.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:35.320
That was my big shock.

00:54:35.320 --> 00:54:37.060
I'm still a little shaking
when I think about that.

00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:38.920
I didn't expect to receive
a letter from

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:40.900
President Carter himself.

00:54:40.900 --> 00:54:43.540
I did a whole talk at the
Library about what he had done

00:54:43.540 --> 00:54:46.750
throughout his administration,
his short time before he was

00:54:46.750 --> 00:54:49.560
involuntarily retired,
as he puts it.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:53.190
And he actually did a lot for
language access, and did a lot

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:57.520
for the deaf community in the
United States, and a lot for

00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.480
court interpreting, and
lots of different

00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.146
areas of language access.

00:55:02.146 --> 00:55:02.840
So--

00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.670
MALE SPEAKER: A nice man.

00:55:03.670 --> 00:55:04.660
His mom was nice, too.

00:55:04.660 --> 00:55:05.670
Ms. Lillian.

00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:06.580
NATALY KELLY: Aww.

00:55:06.580 --> 00:55:08.260
[LAUGHS].

00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.850
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, thank
you for the talk.

00:55:10.850 --> 00:55:12.540
You already addressed
this somewhat,

00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:15.580
but I have a question.

00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:17.630
Do you know Duolingo?

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:22.660
Duolingo is a new technology.

00:55:22.660 --> 00:55:25.690
It's very, very innovative.

00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:30.000
It combines language learning
and crowdsourced translation.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.820
Do you think these kind of new
technologies can change how

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:37.520
translation is done?

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:41.830
NATALY KELLY: Well, I have not
talked with the developers of

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:42.930
Duolingo personally.

00:55:42.930 --> 00:55:45.520
But I have been watching what
they're doing, and all of us

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:48.380
on the research team at Common
Sense Advisor are constantly

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.690
taking briefings from technology
vendors, and

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:54.120
tracking what's going on with
products like Duolingo.

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.590
And I think it's interesting.

00:55:55.590 --> 00:55:56.140
You know?

00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:58.730
I think it's interesting
what they're doing.

00:55:58.730 --> 00:56:01.330
And a lot of companies are
doing very interesting

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:02.390
things right now.

00:56:02.390 --> 00:56:05.140
What I think is even more
interesting than what they're

00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:08.290
doing with their technology is
the fact that they're getting

00:56:08.290 --> 00:56:11.770
funding for some of
these things.

00:56:11.770 --> 00:56:15.070
So, we're starting to see a lot
of high-tech startups that

00:56:15.070 --> 00:56:18.880
are attracting interest from
investors and venture capital.

00:56:18.880 --> 00:56:22.970
And I think that is very
interesting, because I haven't

00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:25.570
really seen the business case
being proved for a lot of

00:56:25.570 --> 00:56:26.760
these things yet.

00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:29.690
But what I'm interested in is
the fact that this is raising

00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:30.920
awareness in society at large.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:35.140
So, Ashton Kutcher is a backer
of Duolingo, and Tim Ferris.

00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:38.450
And we wrote a post recently
on our blog about all the

00:56:38.450 --> 00:56:41.430
celebrities that are backing
translation technologies.

00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:45.000
You know, Gene Simmons from Kiss
is a backer of Ortsbo.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:48.900
And many people don't realize
that Bono has interest in a

00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:51.290
company called SDI Media--

00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:54.140
which some of you might be
familiar with, if you work in

00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:55.880
film and gaming.

00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:57.840
And they do a lot of the
multilingual subtitling of

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:58.330
voiceovers.

00:56:58.330 --> 00:57:01.780
So this kind of interest from
high-profile names and venture

00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:04.100
capital, and actually seeing
some real money come into the

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:07.170
industry is, I think,
of great interest.

00:57:07.170 --> 00:57:09.590
And I'll be very interested
to see if those investors

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:14.470
actually make a profit and
to see what happens.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:15.700
This particular model--

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:18.690
a hybrid of language learning
and translation--

00:57:18.690 --> 00:57:19.680
is interesting.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.390
I have been monitoring what's
happening, and we'll see.

00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:27.410
I try to be open-minded when it
comes to any new innovation

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:30.820
like this, because we are
independent and we kind of

00:57:30.820 --> 00:57:33.210
have to stand back and see
what's happening from a

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:34.860
broader market perspective.

00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:37.380
So we can't be tied to
any old-fashioned

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.250
ways of doing things.

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:40.420
We're always looking at, OK,
what are the newest trends?

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:43.160
And how is this going to
shake up the industry?

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.220
So, we'll see what happens
with Duolingo.

00:57:45.220 --> 00:57:46.620
There's certainly a lot
of buzz about it.

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.356
They're doing a good
job with marketing.

00:57:48.356 --> 00:57:48.832
Yeah.

00:57:48.832 --> 00:57:50.260
[LAUGHS]

00:57:50.260 --> 00:57:51.510
Mm-hmm?

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:57.200
MALE SPEAKER: Your discussion
about the Beyonce picture

00:57:57.200 --> 00:58:00.150
illustrated very interestingly
the amount of context required

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:01.330
to understand something.

00:58:01.330 --> 00:58:03.790
Do you have any analogous
examples from your Shuar

00:58:03.790 --> 00:58:08.170
poetry translation as to what
kind of contextual differences

00:58:08.170 --> 00:58:10.012
would need to be explained?

00:58:10.012 --> 00:58:10.370
NATALY KELLY: Oh.

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:11.380
Too many to list.

00:58:11.380 --> 00:58:13.970
I mean, her culture is so
different from the one that I

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:14.900
grew up in.

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:18.670
And there's a single word in
her language that actually

00:58:18.670 --> 00:58:22.300
means "the song that is emitted
through the fragrance

00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.680
of a plant." "The song that is
emitted through the fragrance

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:28.360
of a plant." And I have to think
about it every time I

00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.030
say it, because it still
confuses me.

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:33.590
So that's in one of her poems.

00:58:33.590 --> 00:58:36.030
And I had to figure out how on
Earth to render that into

00:58:36.030 --> 00:58:38.750
English without destroying the
lyrical quality of the poem.

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:39.630
[LAUGHS]

00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.270
So I went with--

00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:43.490
I went around with "sacred song"
and all these different

00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:45.730
things, and it just
doesn't convey it.

00:58:45.730 --> 00:58:48.300
So we ended up putting an
asterisk and an explanation at

00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:48.790
the bottom.

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:49.280
[LAUGHS]

00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:51.090
Because it's the only
way to give the full

00:58:51.090 --> 00:58:52.530
context to the reader.

00:58:52.530 --> 00:58:54.640
But yeah, there are
many like that.

00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:56.900
But we don't even have to go
to a language like Shuar to

00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.560
come up with examples
like that.

00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.700
There are tons of examples
like this in all kinds of

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.690
languages, even languages
like Spanish.

00:59:06.690 --> 00:59:07.680
There are words--

00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:09.890
and we have a whole example
in the book of words

00:59:09.890 --> 00:59:11.930
for brown in Spanish.

00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:15.110
And it depends on if you're
describing a bear, or an

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:17.270
animal, or eyes, or hair.

00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:20.570
What word do you
use for brown?

00:59:20.570 --> 00:59:22.930
And people have asked me, does
that mean that people who

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:24.960
speak Spanish see shades
of brown that other

00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.462
people don't see?

00:59:26.462 --> 00:59:27.640
Maybe that's one
of the weirdest

00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:28.710
questions that I got, Mary.

00:59:28.710 --> 00:59:29.940
[LAUGHS]

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:34.870
But it is fascinating to think
about all of these different

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:37.830
concepts that we have that are--
even in languages that

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:40.740
are not linguistically that
distant from each other.

00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:46.600
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you very
much for the talk.

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:47.660
I had one question.

00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:51.315
When you were explaining how
much power the translators

00:59:51.315 --> 00:59:55.320
have, especially for translators
at the UN, or who

00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.370
translate for political
issues--

00:59:58.370 --> 01:00:03.850
I was wondering if there were
any ways for citizens to find

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.860
out afterwards if the
translators had

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:10.320
any doubt, or any--

01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.280
were wondering.

01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.390
Like, here, I wasn't
really sure.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:17.463
And this could lead
to potential--

01:00:17.463 --> 01:00:18.430
yeah, yeah.

01:00:18.430 --> 01:00:21.440
So I was wondering, were the
tools available for that?

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.440
NATALY KELLY: Oh, yeah.

01:00:22.440 --> 01:00:23.840
Well, it's very hard.

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.080
There are tons of examples that
we mention in the book.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:28.970
I'll give you one famous one.

01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:33.680
The words "we will bury you"
that were spoken by Nikita

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:36.920
Khrushchev were seen
as a threat.

01:00:36.920 --> 01:00:40.750
And people thought that he
literally meant we want to

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:43.830
kill you, we want to bury you
with a nuclear attack.

01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:46.960
And the phrase that he was
using actually was a more

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.810
common phrase at that time in
Russian that meant something

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:52.270
like, we will be here even
when you are gone.

01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:54.950
We will outlast you.

01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.680
And people have asked me, well,
are you sure that's

01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:58.610
really what that meant?

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:01.670
And I have given examples of
things we say in English, like

01:01:01.670 --> 01:01:03.510
"he came in dead last."

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.450
Or, "oh, you're killing
me," when

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:06.880
someone's making you laugh.

01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.020
If you think about how we
translate those things, they

01:01:11.020 --> 01:01:13.720
could have a similar impact if
they were mistranslated.

01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.700
As for how to go back and find
out if that's exactly what

01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.770
someone said, it's a
really hard thing.

01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:20.470
Because you've probably
seen in the media,

01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:21.480
even in recent times.

01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:25.710
When a mistranslation is out
there, that's the story.

01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:29.500
What that person said, that is
pretty much the story that is

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:30.330
in the news.

01:01:30.330 --> 01:01:33.650
And it's very hard, even when
they issue a correction, to go

01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:35.000
back and change it.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.010
And once it's reached the
public, it's really too late

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.210
to go out--

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:41.110
the public isn't going to be
interested in a story about a

01:01:41.110 --> 01:01:42.910
mistranslation.

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:44.050
So, it's--

01:01:44.050 --> 01:01:47.730
unfortunately, a lot of what
we hear in the news is

01:01:47.730 --> 01:01:50.210
affected by the translator's
skills and by the

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.680
interpreter's skills.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:54.250
So, we have a lot of examples
of that in the book.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:57.550
And I was asked the other day,
well, do you have any examples

01:01:57.550 --> 01:02:00.060
of people who mistranslated
those things on purpose?

01:02:00.060 --> 01:02:01.610
[LAUGHS]

01:02:01.610 --> 01:02:02.660
And I'm not--

01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:04.120
I'm not able to go
and interview

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.200
the exact, you know--

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.615
maybe that's another book.

01:02:06.615 --> 01:02:07.080
[LAUGHS]

01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:12.600
But certainly we have plenty
of examples of that.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.100
And I don't think that
most of those have

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:14.910
been done on purpose.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:17.710
I think the job of the
interpreter is just so

01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:21.610
difficult that a lot of times,
interpreters make mistakes.

01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:25.460
And so that's often the result
when we see some of those

01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:27.262
things in the news.

01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:27.760
Yeah.

01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:28.260
TALIA: Hi, Nataly.

01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.740
Thank you very much, and
welcome to the Bay, and

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.240
congratulations on
the publication.

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.430
Can you talk a little bit
about the process of

01:02:36.430 --> 01:02:41.760
collecting the stories and the
decision-making of what to

01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.080
include and what not?

01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.650
And also, whether this book
is going to be translated?

01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:47.550
[LAUGHTER].

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.700
NATALY KELLY: [LAUGHS]

01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.290
Leave it to Talia to
come up with two

01:02:51.290 --> 01:02:53.440
really great questions.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:57.210
So, as for how we chose the
stories to include in the

01:02:57.210 --> 01:03:01.700
book, it was very important that
we picked stories that

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.080
would reflect a range
of human emotions.

01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.650
So we were careful to make sure
that we didn't have too

01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:10.140
many tear-jerkers, and too many
funny mistranslations.

01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:12.880
We wanted to hit every emotion
that we could.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.090
We also wanted to hit every part
of life that we could.

01:03:16.090 --> 01:03:20.380
So we had stories about
translation of sacred texts

01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:22.920
and religion, because we wanted
people to see how

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.500
translation affects their
spiritual life.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:28.940
But we also have stories about
translation in mundane topics.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:34.060
And things like MAC Cosmetics,
and Harlequin romance novels,

01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.330
and Hallmark Cards, and Nescafe,
and all of these

01:03:38.330 --> 01:03:39.960
kinds of things, you
know, products that

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:41.280
people use every day.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:45.820
So we really did try to pick a
range of topics that would hit

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.860
many different areas of life.

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.870
And we also looked at the common
things that people like

01:03:50.870 --> 01:03:52.900
to read about, even
in the newspaper.

01:03:52.900 --> 01:03:57.590
The sports section, the food
section, the politics section.

01:03:57.590 --> 01:03:59.520
Current events.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.810
Lifestyle, arts, entertainment,

01:04:01.810 --> 01:04:02.610
those kinds of things.

01:04:02.610 --> 01:04:05.920
So, we tried to hit on basically
every aspect of

01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:07.450
life-- as many as we could.

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:10.240
And I wanted to include a
section on science, but that

01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:12.693
didn't seem that interesting
to the average reader.

01:04:12.693 --> 01:04:13.500
[LAUGHS]

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:16.720
But we tried to include as many
as we possibly could.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.580
As for whether or not the book
will be translated--

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:22.230
I've had lots of volunteers,
because I have lots of friends

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.120
who are translators.

01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:26.970
This is really a question of the
publisher, and publishing

01:04:26.970 --> 01:04:28.500
rights, and how that
all works.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:31.670
So, basically, if a publisher
in another country wants to

01:04:31.670 --> 01:04:33.700
publish the book in another
language, they have to buy the

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:37.080
foreign rights from Penguin
USA, which is the original

01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.350
publisher, and then they can
commission a translation in

01:04:41.350 --> 01:04:43.150
that language for
that country.

01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:45.790
So I actually don't have
much control over that.

01:04:45.790 --> 01:04:48.320
But what I do know is, the more
popular it is in the home

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:50.230
market where it's launched,
usually, the more interest

01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:52.950
there is in doing translated
versions in other countries.

01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:55.180
So my hope is that
that will happen.

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:57.920
But I also think it's going to
be a hard book to translate,

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.601
because there's a lot
of humor in it.

01:04:59.601 --> 01:05:01.485
[LAUGHS]

01:05:01.485 --> 01:05:01.960
Yeah.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.290
Thank you.

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:04.560
Yes.

01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:04.830
DAGMAR DOLATSCHKO: Yeah.

01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:07.280
Dagmar Dolatschko with Peritus
Language Services.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:09.210
Thank you for this
beautiful book.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:09.810
This is great.

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:13.450
We need to get the word out
more about our profession.

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:15.730
But I have a question
which maybe you can

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:17.410
answer because of your--

01:05:17.410 --> 01:05:20.580
all your insights with Common
Sense Advisory.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:24.770
With this increasing amount of
volume, we're just buried--

01:05:24.770 --> 01:05:25.170
[LAUGHS]

01:05:25.170 --> 01:05:26.440
to use your word--

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.920
in content.

01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.090
And the ever-increasing
price pressure.

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:34.140
Where do you see quality
going in translation?

01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.750
And that people still
understand, like in any other

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:39.670
profession, they will get
what they pay for?

01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:40.470
NATALY KELLY: Yes.

01:05:40.470 --> 01:05:46.690
Well, we did a study in 2008
on quality, and how buyers

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:47.850
define quality.

01:05:47.850 --> 01:05:49.510
And one of the very interesting
things that we

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:52.550
found was that quality was
defined slightly differently,

01:05:52.550 --> 01:05:54.760
depending on who was buying.

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.660
And so buyers in the retail
sector, for example, told us,

01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:01.170
it doesn't matter to us if the
product name is spelled wrong,

01:06:01.170 --> 01:06:03.750
or even if the description
has a typo.

01:06:03.750 --> 01:06:07.440
But if the numbers are wrong,
we have a major problem.

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:09.540
Because if we've advertised that
that product is on sale

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:13.910
for $199.99, and they get a
decimal point wrong, or they

01:06:13.910 --> 01:06:17.200
get a number wrong, we are
out millions of dollars.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.320
So for them, the way
they define quality

01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:22.780
was accuracy of numbers.

01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:24.890
So that was in the
retail sector.

01:06:24.890 --> 01:06:29.200
In sectors like life sciences,
of course, every single thing

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.680
has to be perfect.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:33.220
There has to be no room for
mistranslations, because human

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:35.390
lives are on the line.

01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:38.640
And in the automotive sector,
it depends on the type of

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:39.540
content, of course.

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:42.750
But for some things, like
user-generated content, of

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:45.580
course, and certain help
content, it was viewed as

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:49.140
acceptable to use machine
translation, and to have some

01:06:49.140 --> 01:06:51.770
disclaimer that this is not
perfect translation.

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:55.220
And that if you need a perfect
translation, contact us.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.770
And if they'd get a certain
number of inquiries, they

01:06:56.770 --> 01:06:59.630
would start to pay for
professional translation of

01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.760
that with a human involved.

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.330
But the notion of quality--

01:07:04.330 --> 01:07:07.060
because a lot of times vendors
of translation services will

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:10.540
talk about quality as if it's
just this one big thing that

01:07:10.540 --> 01:07:11.330
can be defined.

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:14.280
And our research shows that it's
much more nuanced than

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:18.050
that, and that there are certain
purposes for which

01:07:18.050 --> 01:07:19.820
different levels of quality
are acceptable.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:22.640
And we've actually gone to the
trouble of defining different

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.780
levels of quality for different
content types in

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:26.390
some of our research.

01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:29.280
So, the answer is, quality
depends on

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.780
who's doing the buying.

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:32.480
DAGMAR DOLATSCHKO: Thank you.

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.350
NATALY KELLY: Mm-hmm.

01:07:34.350 --> 01:07:36.440
MALE SPEAKER: I'm interested to
follow up on what you said

01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:40.140
about not everybody should be a
translator even if he or she

01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.650
speaks multiple languages.

01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:44.340
So, who should be
a translator?

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:47.930
And what characteristics does
that person need to make that

01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:48.540
successful?

01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:50.436
NATALY KELLY: Mm-hmm.

01:07:50.436 --> 01:07:53.385
Well, the reasons that
translators--

01:07:53.385 --> 01:07:55.770
or would-be professional
translators and interpreters--

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:59.350
fail exams are different
depending on if we're talking

01:07:59.350 --> 01:08:00.570
about translation
or interpreting.

01:08:00.570 --> 01:08:02.360
But from an interpreting
perspective--

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:03.310
because that's--

01:08:03.310 --> 01:08:06.170
I have actually graded exams
for interpreting.

01:08:06.170 --> 01:08:09.440
I can say that the reason that
they typically fail is because

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.510
they haven't worked enough
on interpreting skills.

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:14.050
So, memory length.

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:17.580
Being able to remember the
information and transfer the

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:20.770
information without losing
information.

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:21.870
Or transforming it.

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:24.350
Because that's another thing
that sometimes interpreters

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.540
will accidentally just change
the meaning or forget

01:08:27.540 --> 01:08:29.540
something, or they mishear
something.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:30.760
They don't comprehend
properly.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.790
And so they say something
different than what was

01:08:32.790 --> 01:08:33.770
actually said.

01:08:33.770 --> 01:08:35.680
So, that's the reason
that people fail a

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:36.500
lot of those exams.

01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:39.729
A lot of it is lack of
preparation, lack of training,

01:08:39.729 --> 01:08:42.310
and lack of practice,
lack of skills.

01:08:42.310 --> 01:08:46.810
Not everybody has the skills and
has the ability to retain

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.100
large segments of information
and transfer them.

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:52.250
And some people simply lack
the language proficiency.

01:08:52.250 --> 01:08:57.189
Because you might be fluent
in two languages, but that

01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:59.180
doesn't mean that you can
be, for example, a court

01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:00.319
interpreter.

01:09:00.319 --> 01:09:03.020
If I ask you to say
"arraignment" in another

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.120
language-- even if you speak
that language, you can talk to

01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:06.390
your friends and family--

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:08.580
you might not know how
to say arraignment

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.100
in that other language.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.410
So, part of it is lack of
terminology knowledge, and

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:15.990
specialist terminology
in particular.

01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:17.689
So, that's the reason
that a lot of

01:09:17.689 --> 01:09:19.580
interpreters fail exams.

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.720
In the case of translation,
it's quite similar.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:24.819
Sometimes it's making mistakes
with transferring meaning,

01:09:24.819 --> 01:09:26.710
sometimes it's not knowing how
to use the appropriate

01:09:26.710 --> 01:09:29.590
resources to research
terminology, and not knowing

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:33.050
how to apply tools, or use
tools in the case of some

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:36.399
exams, depending on who's
doing me the testing.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:39.140
So there are a lot of reasons
why translators and

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.100
interpreters will fail.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:42.420
But I would say the biggest
reason is because they

01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.410
overestimate their level of
ability to manipulate the

01:09:46.410 --> 01:09:50.090
language and to really go deep
in terms of terminology and in

01:09:50.090 --> 01:09:53.180
terms of understanding in
a specialized area.

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:55.040
