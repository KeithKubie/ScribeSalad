00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.140
Like many inventions, versions of an airplane
“black box” were independently invented

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.560
by several people, in this case beginning
around the 1930s and 1940s. As for the version

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:30.289
that began being installed on commercial aircraft,
it was invented in response to a tragic loss

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:35.120
of life. A De Havilland Comet 1, the world’s
first commercial jet-powered airplane, disintegrated

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:42.059
over India in early 1953. Of the 43 passengers
and crew members, none survived. Australian

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.620
chemist Dr. David Warren joined an expert
panel looking into the cause of that crash

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.859
and two other crashes involving the Comet
1. Australia had a vested interest in the

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.719
success of the Comet because of its possible
use by Australian airlines for a route between

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.180
Australia and the United Kingdom.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.129
While Dr. Warren was an expert in fuel research,
the plane crashes resonated with him for another

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.450
reason; his father died in 1934 when the plane
he was on crashed into the ocean off Australia’s

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.409
southern coast; investigators never discovered
the cause of that crash. Warren’s part in

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.479
the investigation of the Comet accident led
him to believe that a simple voice recorder

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.440
located on the plane during the crash would
have saved the investigators time and energy

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.420
trying to determine what went wrong. “If
a businessman had been using one of these

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.690
in the plane… and we could find it in the
wreckage and we played it back, we’d say,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.740
‘We know what caused this.’”

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.970
Warren drew on his background in electronics,
experience he gained from building “crystal

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.450
sets” or unpowered radio receivers in school,
and he created a prototype of the ARL Flight

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.840
Memory Unit. This device recorded both conversations
in the cockpit and a small number of instrument

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.310
readings for up to four hours of the flight.
Once the four hour recording time had been

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.420
reached, the recording device recycled and
recorded over the oldest information. While

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.860
the ARL Flight Memory Unit prototype, named
in part for the Aeronautical Research Laboratories

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.640
where Warren worked, showed success during
flights conducted by the Australian Department

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.259
of Civil Aviation, the Australian government
and military failed to show further interest

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.259
in the device.

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:16.310
In 1958, a British official visiting Australia
learned of Warren’s Flight Memory Unit and

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.379
invited him to England to continue work on
the device with scientists and manufacturers.

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.300
It soon went into production in England and
in the United States before being installed

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.280
in aircraft around the world. In an ironic
twist, Australia became the first country

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.340
to require all turbine-powered airplanes weighing
over 12,500 pounds to have these devices onboard.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.930
So how did the ARL Flight Memory Unit become
known as a black box? That’s a bit of a

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.030
mystery, especially considering that within
the industry it is almost never called this

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.090
and the devices themselves are a color called
international orange which allows them to

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.950
be more easily found at the site of a plane
crash. That said, the first known instance

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.370
of these devices being called a “black box”
was very early on at an Aeronautical Research

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.511
Council meeting in August of 1958. The man
who called it that was one E. Newton. Why

00:03:05.511 --> 00:03:06.980
he did so isn’t known.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.150
As such, there are a number of theories about
how the term “black box” came about. One

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.490
theory states that the name came from the
fact that the boxes were often blackened and

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.790
charred from fires occurring after the crash.
Given the first known instance of someone

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.290
calling it this was about the time Warren
was invited to England to further his work

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.820
on the devices (before they were widely installed
on planes, other than for testing purposes),

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.830
this seems unlikely. Another, much more plausible,
theory is that it’s a holdover from WWII

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.210
where the Royal Air Force used to refer to
various experimental devices put on planes,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.220
such as the Oboe targeting system, as a “black-box.”
Another very plausible explanation is that

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.630
it is originally from the engineering practice
of calling a system that takes input, does

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.980
something to it, then gives some output, without
specifically referencing the internal workings

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.520
of the device- how it actually accomplishes
the thing it’s meant to do- a “black box.”

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.400
Either way, the nickname was (and still is)
particularly popular with members of the media,

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.370
while aviation experts almost always refer
to them as flight data recorders.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.849
As for modern black boxes, they have undergone
a number of improvements over the years, though

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.540
the basic thing they do is the same as the
original. Specifically, they consist of two

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.940
separate devices: the Cockpit Voice Recorder
(CVR) and the Flight Data Recorder (FDR).

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.550
The CVR records all of the noise inside the
cockpit. That includes the conversation between

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.400
the crew members, radio transmissions, any
alarms, the sounds of the controls being used,

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.129
and even noise from the engine and air moving
around the plane. Today, CVRs record a total

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:39.930
of two hours of audio before the newest audio
recording overwrites the oldest part of the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:40.930
recording.

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.279
The FDR records a variety of flight data,
though the exact requirements depend on things

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.771
like the age and size of the plane and what
sort of equipment is on board. However, all

00:04:48.771 --> 00:04:54.409
black boxes are required to record, at a minimum,
the pressure altitude, indicated airspeed,

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.159
magnetic heading, normal acceleration, and
microphone keying. The final item, microphone

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.430
keying, lets investigators match the data
with the CVR recording. While the FDR records

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.389
on the same endless-loop principle as the
CVR, it records a total of 25-hours before

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.550
overwriting the oldest information.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.969
Black boxes need to survive the impact of
the crash along with any fire that might occur

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.639
afterwards if they are to be of any use to
investigators. While they occasionally change

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.810
in response to crashes, recorder crash-worthiness
standards typically require boxes be able

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:31.020
to survive such circumstances as a 1,100°
Celsius fire for an hour, 33 km/s² of acceleration

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:36.330
for 6.5 milliseconds (about what would be
produced in a crash at 310 mph), and being

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.129
immersed in saltwater at specific depths,
among other such specifications. The placement

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:44.599
of the black box in the tail of the plane
also raises the likelihood of survival as

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:49.159
the tail section doesn’t usually bear the
brunt of the crash impact. Additionally, a

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:53.490
locator beacon is included which can also
help investigators find the black box if the

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.170
aircraft crashes in the water as it emits
a “pinger” signal for at least thirty

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:58.199
days (and it will soon likely be raised to
a ninety day requirement).

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.162
Thanks to the Malaysian Airline Flight 370
crash, a marked upgrade in how flight data

00:06:02.162 --> 00:06:03.162
recorders work has also been proposed, utilizing
more modern technology since the last major

00:06:03.162 --> 00:06:06.659
overhaul of the “black box.” The most
significant change, and perhaps the most helpful,

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:11.800
suggested is to decentralize the box. Instead
of just having an on-board recording, add

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.879
in a system for broadcasting in real time
the data it’s storing to some central database

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:21.139
on the ground. This way, even if the on board
recorder can’t be located (such as when

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.659
the plane itself can’t be found), the ground
crew still has the data they need to analyze

00:06:25.659 --> 00:08:16.249
what caused the crash, and with last broadcast
coordinates, even more accurately

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:38.870
where 
to

00:08:38.870 --> 00:09:33.420
start looking for

00:09:33.420 --> 00:10:25.690
the plane and potential survivors.
