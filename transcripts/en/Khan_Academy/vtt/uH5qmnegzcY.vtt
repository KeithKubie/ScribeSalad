00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.940
I just realized that when I just
did problem number 14, I

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.220
got a weird answer because,
once again, I

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.130
cannot add and multiply.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.250
But just redoing it just so
you get the right answer.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.300
Number 14.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.440
Oh, they give you a,
3a, dot, dot, dot.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.500
And they say that each term is
3 times the previous term.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.690
So the next term is going
to be 9a and so forth.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.710
They say the sum of the first
five terms is 605.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.670
And so what is a?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.460
Well, what are the
first five terms?

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.490
It's a, 3a, 9a, 27a-- I'm just
multiplying by 3 every time.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.880
81a.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.040
And this is always the part
that I will mess up.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.270
This is 1a.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.870
So 1 plus 3 is 4.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.570
4 plus 9 is 13.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:59.550
13 plus 7 is 20, plus 1 is 21.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.349
And then 4 plus 8, 121a is equal
to-- and they say, it

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:05.910
equals 605.

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.190
The sum of the first
five terms, 605.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:16.370
a is equal to 605/121,
and that is 5.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:20.360
Much easier when you
can add properly.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.150
That's all I had for this video
because I just had to

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.700
correct my mistake.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.020
See you in the next problem.
