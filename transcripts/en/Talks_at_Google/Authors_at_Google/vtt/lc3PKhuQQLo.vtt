00:00:08.522 --> 00:00:10.230
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
to Talks at Google.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.150
Today we have a very special
guest, Salman Rushdie.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.570
It's been over 25 years since
the publishing of "The Satanic

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.830
Verses" that made
him a household name,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.850
but before that he was
already a fellow in the Royal

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.510
Society of Literature.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.530
And in 2007, he was knighted
by Queen Elizabeth II.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.730
Not to mention that in 2001 he
stole the spotlight in the film

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.220
"Bridget Jones's Diary."

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.480
In his novel "Luka
and the Fire of Life,"

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.415
there's a telling bit
of dialogue that states,

00:00:42.415 --> 00:00:46.330
"You of all boys should know
that man is the storytelling

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.880
animal, and that stories
are his identity,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.000
his meaning, his lifeblood.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.400
Do rats tell tales?

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.330
Do porpoises have
narrative purposes?

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.042
Do elephants elephantisize?

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:05.600
You know as well as I
do that they do not.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.640
Man alone burns with books."

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.140
With 12 novels and
many works to his name,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.990
he's lived a life fully
realizing these words.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.610
He truly knows what
it means to have

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.590
his stories he his identity,
his meaning, and his life blood.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:23.630
In his new novel, "Two
Years, Eight Months,

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.620
and Twenty-Eight
Nights," Salman goes

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.920
beyond the traditional
1,001 Nights

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.330
with a magical story
spanning the centuries,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.605
and brings a mythical struggle
to America's doorstop.

00:01:33.605 --> 00:01:36.350
It is my pleasure today to
introduce Salman Rushdie.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:40.318
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.430
SALMAN RUSHDIE: So we
were just talking before,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.870
and I was asked if it was
true that in my earlier days

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.770
I made my money writing
advertising copy.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.770
And I did.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.820
And actually, one of
the strangest things

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.789
about the final
season of "Mad Men"

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.130
is that it basically
caught up with the time

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.090
when I was working
in advertising.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.100
So it was horribly familiar.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.160
I mean, I remember "I'd like
to teach the world to sing,"

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.624
and it suddenly
made me think, oh,

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:25.290
that's why they work
in McCann Erickson,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.600
because that's where
the Coke ad was made.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.020
And I have to say that
it wasn't quite as

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.420
alcoholic as this television
series, but pretty close.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.470
And it wasn't completely as
sexist as the television world,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.540
but also pretty close.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.190
I remember I worked at Ogilvy
[INAUDIBLE] for a long time,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.274
on and off freelance.

00:02:52.274 --> 00:02:55.500
And when you work at
Ogilvy's on the first day

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.890
there-- this was
a long time ago--

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.960
you were given a
copy of the book

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.245
by David Ogilvy about
his advertising.

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:04.600
It's called something like
Confessions of an Advertising

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.950
Writer.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.890
And just to give you
a flavor of the time,

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.410
the first sentence
of the book says,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.930
"The consumer is not a moron.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.060
She is your wife."

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.870
That was very much the-- I think
you recognize that attitude

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.290
from the television series.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.540
Anyway, I escaped that.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.260
In fact, when "Midnight's
Children" came out in 1981

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.520
and started doing pretty well,
I thought, finally, I can leave.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.980
And so I went to the creative
director of the agency

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.960
and I said, I wrote this
book and it's doing fine.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.499
I always wanted to
be a writer, so I

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.540
think I'm going to try
and be a full-time writer.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.420
And so I quit.

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.810
And he said, oh
you want a raise.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.110
And I said, no, really.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.187
This isn't a negotiation.

00:03:56.187 --> 00:03:57.770
This is what I've
always wanted to do,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.030
and now I'm going
to go and do it.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.240
And he said, oh, you
want a big raise.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.690
And I tried to say to him
that no, look, I'm supposed

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.220
to give you 30 days notice.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.230
So this is 30 days
notice, and 31 days

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.829
from now I'm not going to
be coming in the office.

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.955
And he said, I don't think we
could give you as much as that.

00:04:19.955 --> 00:04:24.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.210
But then, to be fair to him,
when the book actually did

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.284
do very well-- it won the
Booker Prize and so on-- we

00:04:32.284 --> 00:04:34.075
used to have these
things called telegrams.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.220
The first telegram I got was
from my very relieved bank

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.910
manager.

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.380
The second telegram was from
him, the creative director.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.012
And it said very sweetly,
one of us made it.

00:04:48.012 --> 00:04:50.220
Because of course, everybody
who works in advertising

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.550
has a TV sitcom in the
bottom drawer or a novel

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.850
or a play or a movie
script or something.

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.265
So yeah, that was my
escape from advertising.

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:02.210
But what it did teach
me-- and I think

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:08.420
it's a lesson I've kept
paying attention to-- it

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.390
taught me two things.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.440
One is it taught me to
do the work like a job,

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.840
not to think about inspiration
but just sit down every morning

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.360
and do my day's work and in a
way not give myself permission

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.920
not to do it.

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.580
Because when you're
working to deadlines--

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.040
I guess journalists
learn the same thing--

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.276
you can't afford to
have creative tantrums.

00:05:32.276 --> 00:05:34.150
You've just got to get
the work done on time,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.570
and it's got to be good.

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.720
So that was a good
lesson to learn,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.475
that lesson of professionalism.

00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:43.350
And the other thing,
which is a strange thing

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.183
to say for somebody
who's written very, very

00:05:45.183 --> 00:05:47.320
long books sometimes--
this book is,

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.950
I'm happy to say, not that long;
finally in my old age learning

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:55.112
to be brief.

00:05:55.112 --> 00:05:57.070
I have written some long
books, but advertising

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.530
does teach you in fact
not to waste words,

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.250
because you don't have
any words to waste.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.110
And I've always again
taken that lesson

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:09.550
into the writing of novels,
because even if you write

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:11.110
a long novel, I've
always thought,

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.440
it has to feel like it
needed to be that long

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.580
and could have been much
longer if you hadn't really

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.400
been as concise as you could.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.700
The worst thing of all is to
read a long novel that feels

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.890
like it's going on forever.

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:29.070
Then it's kind of
close to unbearable.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.470
There's too many
of those around.

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:32.900
Anyway, so I think
I did actually

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:39.970
get quite a lot of useful
information from that time.

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:42.990
And I guess the other
thing you think about a lot

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:45.700
and that I've thought about
more and more as I've gone

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:52.170
on is exactly how readers read.

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:56.110
It's very easy as a
creative artist to think,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.830
well, I'm just doing my
thing, and I'll do it exactly

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:01.420
as I want and then
it's up to the readers

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.630
to find their way to it.

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.010
I think I've probably been
guilty of that as well,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.690
but I've just become
very interested

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:15.860
in exactly how readers go
about the business of reading,

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:19.320
and what attracts them
and what repels them

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.990
and how you hold attention
and how you lose it.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:27.040
And one of the things
that really helped me--

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.030
I grew up in India, and one
of the things about India

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.090
is there still is a
very rich oral tradition

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:36.560
of storytelling in
some parts of India,

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.980
particularly in south India.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.580
There are oral storytellers
who still command

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.397
very large audiences,
like maybe 10 times

00:07:43.397 --> 00:07:44.480
the size of this audience.

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.880
And they're immensely popular.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.000
They're so popular some
of them that they actually

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.010
are recruited by politicians
during election campaigns

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:56.830
and things like that,
and they can actually

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.800
swing percentages of the vote.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.960
But the interesting thing
about the oral story in India

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.250
is that characteristically,
it's not told as a linear story.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:10.320
It doesn't go
beginning, middle, end.

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:15.570
The famous advice given to
the White Rabbit by the King

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.770
of Hearts in the trial scene
in "Alice in Wonderland,"

00:08:18.770 --> 00:08:21.680
when the White Rabbit is having
trouble getting evidence,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.415
the King says, start
at the beginning,

00:08:23.415 --> 00:08:27.040
go on until you reach
the end, and then stop.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.540
And there's a
conventional wisdom

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:31.670
that that's how
you tell stories.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:35.799
But the oral story,
very remarkably,

00:08:35.799 --> 00:08:37.169
doesn't do that at all.

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:39.640
When one of these
storytellers stands up,

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.450
he will usually start
with an anecdote drawn out

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:48.550
of mythology, out of the rich
Indian mythological tradition.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.040
And he'll tell that
for a bit, and then he

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.430
will connect that to
perhaps some political event

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.220
of the time and try and show you
the connections between that,

00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:00.790
and then he'll connect that
to some possible anecdote

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.880
of his own life, and then
he'll sing a little song,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.710
and then he'll have
some other digressions.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:10.630
And there's like four
or five narrative lines

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.950
that he's juggling
at any given moment.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:18.610
And what is interesting
is that instead

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.219
of that being confusing
to the audience,

00:09:22.219 --> 00:09:23.260
it's actually delightful.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:27.130
The audience enjoys
the skill with which

00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.584
the story lines are interwoven.

00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:33.000
And just when you think it
can't get any more complicated,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.230
he'll throw another
ball in the air

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:40.440
and juggle these narrative
balls, if you like.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.380
And I thought, this
is the exact opposite

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:45.480
of what you're taught
about how to write a story.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.670
And yet, here is this
very, very ancient form,

00:09:48.670 --> 00:09:51.670
the oral narrative, and
the oral storyteller

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.990
knows exactly when he loses
the attention of his reader,

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:58.370
of his audience, because
they get up and walk away.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.880
Or if you're really
unlucky, they

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.940
start throwing things at you.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:03.640
But anyway, it
becomes very clear

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.670
when they're not with you.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.270
And so everything
about oral narration

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.780
is designed to hold the
audience's attention.

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.820
That's its sole purpose.

00:10:13.820 --> 00:10:16.860
And interestingly
then, this playfulness,

00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:20.740
this multiple
narration, turns out

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.480
to be a better way of
holding people's attention

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.650
than the conventional
beginning, middle, end way.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:30.670
And so I thought, that's
really interesting,

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.750
and what could I do with that?

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.460
One of the things this
book has is really

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.780
quite a lot of
narrative lines that

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:41.750
weave in and out of each
other, and I sometimes

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:44.200
think of it and others
of my books as being,

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.490
in a way, written down versions
of that oral storytelling

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:50.560
tradition, or at least that
they've learned a great deal

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.670
from that tradition.

00:10:55.410 --> 00:10:58.800
The other thing to say
about growing up in India

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:07.470
is that you're very lucky to
grow up in a world of story.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.750
The incredible narrative
traditions of India

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.170
are a great gift to all
of us who grew there.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.960
First of all, of course,
there are the great epics,

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:19.380
like the Ramayana
and the Mahabharata.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:23.070
But there are also
all these traditions

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:25.910
of what collectively
have gotten known

00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:30.800
as wonder tales, of which
The Arabian Nights, the 1,001

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.680
Nights, is the most famous.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.960
But there are many others.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.710
In India there's a
wonderful collection

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:38.190
of animal fables,
the Panchatantra.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.320
And what is great and
very contemporary about

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.920
those is that unlike
European fables,

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.440
unlike the kind of
Aesop's fable tradition,

00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.960
they're not moralistic.

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.400
Aesop's fables always end
up with a neat little moral,

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.700
like don't be greedy,
or be kind to people.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:58.080
But the Panchatantra fables
aren't like that at all.

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:00.900
In fact, they're very
often deeply cynical,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.044
and the bad guys often win.

00:12:04.044 --> 00:12:05.585
And that makes them
feel very modern.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:13.680
Then there are various
compendiums of wonder tales.

00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.160
And even the Arabian
Nights so-called,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.560
many of those stories
actually originated in India.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:22.759
The journey of that book
is very interesting.

00:12:22.759 --> 00:12:24.300
Almost certainly,
most of the stories

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:25.930
started out as Indian folktales.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.410
And then at a certain point
they were written down

00:12:29.410 --> 00:12:32.120
in Persian, in Farsi
originally, because that was

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.190
the court language at the time.

00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.530
And they moved west into
the Persian-speaking,

00:12:38.530 --> 00:12:40.930
Farsi-speaking world.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:44.400
That was a book which was
called Hazar Afsanah, which

00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:46.866
means 1,000 stories.

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.490
And that book has
been completely lost.

00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:50.740
There's not a single
copy of it survives.

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:54.410
And the only reason we
know of its existence

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:57.920
is because it's referred
to in other people's books.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.830
But we know of it
that in that book

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:05.270
already, the famous story of
Scheherazade, telling stories

00:13:05.270 --> 00:13:08.130
to save her life
is already present.

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:11.880
And at the certain point it
goes from Farsi into Arabic

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:18.690
and becomes Alf Layla Wa-Layla,
the 1,000 nights and one night.

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.210
And on each of these
steps of the journey,

00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:23.850
certain stories fall
out and other stories

00:13:23.850 --> 00:13:29.180
are added so that there isn't
really a definitive text.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.210
The text changes
as the book moves.

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:37.480
And after the
Arabic version moved

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.855
around the
Arabic-speaking world,

00:13:38.855 --> 00:13:41.490
it eventually found
its way into Europe,

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.290
initially into French, where
it was translated into French

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:50.450
by a man called Antoine Galland,
who again dropped a few stories

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.620
and added a few stories.

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:54.310
And interestingly, some
of the stories he added

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:56.120
are the ones that
you all know about.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.360
That's when Aladin enters
the Arabian Nights,

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:02.270
and that's when Ali-Baba
enters the Arabian Nights.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:06.300
So oddly, these are actually
not Eastern stories at all.

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:08.214
They're kind of French.

00:14:08.214 --> 00:14:11.080
Do you think of Aladin
as a French person?

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.470
And then eventually from
French they made their way

00:14:17.470 --> 00:14:19.040
into English and so on.

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.230
It's a very interesting
journey about how stories

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:25.240
move across the world and
inspire people in one culture

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:29.040
after another-- and
survive, in this case,

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.380
probably these stories,
the earliest of them,

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.170
are probably 2,000 years old.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:39.630
And yet, here we are still
reading them and having

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:43.180
movies made out of them.

00:14:43.180 --> 00:14:44.700
I actually did meet
one real genie.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:49.069
I did meet Robin Williams,
and that was extraordinary

00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:50.610
because he never
stopped [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.390
He was always on.

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:57.040
And it was kind of extraordinary
to just sit there and listen

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.255
to this soliloquy.

00:15:01.497 --> 00:15:03.080
I'll share with you
a story he told me

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.090
about playing the
genie in the movie.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.620
It was originally supposed
to be quite a small part,

00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.660
and so he was hired
essentially as a day player

00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:15.090
to come in to do a day's
recording, and went and did it,

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.522
the bit that was written.

00:15:16.522 --> 00:15:18.230
And then he said to
them, I think there's

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:20.460
a bit more in this character.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:21.630
Can I just have a go?

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.780
Can I just try a few things out?

00:15:23.780 --> 00:15:26.280
And they said all right, and
so he was there for a few hours

00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.000
and he just went.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.802
And the improvisations
were so brilliant

00:15:29.802 --> 00:15:32.010
that they actually had to
reanimate the film in order

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:34.102
to make the character
much bigger.

00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:36.060
And he said, then they
got a little bit guilty,

00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:37.360
because they hadn't
really paid me

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:39.443
very much money, because
initially it was supposed

00:15:39.443 --> 00:15:40.759
to be quite a small role.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.800
He says, they got guilty.

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:43.758
So he took me into his
dining room and he said,

00:15:43.758 --> 00:15:45.022
so they gave me this.

00:15:45.022 --> 00:15:46.480
And he pointed over
the mantlepiece

00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:48.780
and there was really quite
a large, rather beautiful

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.610
late-period Picasso.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:53.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:59.570
So that's what he
got for being blue.

00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:08.195
Anyway, so this book has genies
in it attacking Manhattan.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.550
And the last thing I
want to say before I just

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.140
read you a little bit of
it-- and then we can talk--

00:16:17.140 --> 00:16:20.930
is that it comes out of not
just an Eastern tradition

00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:25.470
of magic stories, but also a
Western tradition for which I

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:28.380
suppose the generic
term is surrealism.

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.930
And I think I've been
very affected as an artist

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:36.620
not just by the
literature of surrealism,

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:39.520
but actually by the visual
arts of surrealism--

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.600
by the paintings
of Rene Magritte,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.550
by the films of Luis
Bunuel and Salvador Dali.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:53.680
And I think their influence is
here somewhere in this book.

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.270
And also, what then
developed out of surrealism,

00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:00.440
which was what was called
the theatre of the absurd,

00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:05.430
playwrights like Eugene
Ionesco and Samuel Beckett.

00:17:05.430 --> 00:17:08.190
So I think that
tradition, which to me

00:17:08.190 --> 00:17:11.329
is the kind of Western
counterpart of the Eastern

00:17:11.329 --> 00:17:14.960
wonder tale-- those two
things are the things that

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.910
came together in
a way to give me

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:19.579
the way that I've
characteristically

00:17:19.579 --> 00:17:21.380
approached writing.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:23.400
And one of the things
that really struck me

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:26.780
about surrealism is that
one of the key ideas

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:33.660
of the surrealists was the idea
that when we look at the world,

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:38.760
we look at it through eyes
that are dulled by habituation,

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.260
because we're used to things.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:44.240
We look at things
through habituated eyes.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.430
And they argued that that
formed a kind of, if you like,

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:52.270
coating over our vision, which
made us neglect to notice

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.810
that the world is marvelous.

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:56.980
And so the idea
of surrealism was

00:17:56.980 --> 00:17:58.780
the idea of making
it strange, the idea

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:01.830
of scratching away
that patina that

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.010
dulls our vision so
that we can again

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.150
perceive the world as wonderful.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:12.130
I think that's as good a reason
for doing this kind of thing

00:18:12.130 --> 00:18:15.090
as any.

00:18:15.090 --> 00:18:21.170
So in this book, the jinn
is the collective term.

00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:23.170
The singular is
jinnia, which is where

00:18:23.170 --> 00:18:26.000
the word "genie" comes from.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.540
There's good ones and bad ones.

00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:31.290
Actually, one of the good
ones is a jinnia princess

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:33.060
who falls in love
with a human being.

00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.150
And there was this awful
moment halfway through the book

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:39.344
where I thought that I might be
rewriting "I Dream of Jeannie."

00:18:39.344 --> 00:18:41.991
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.340
And it there was just a moment
where you stop and think,

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:46.440
really?

00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.290
Have I just done
that by mistake?

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.290
I think you'll see
if you read the book

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:58.520
that the people involved,
both supernatural and human,

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:02.720
are really extremely unlike
the characters in the sitcom.

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:03.839
There's no harem pants.

00:19:03.839 --> 00:19:04.880
There's no nose-wiggling.

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.980
But there is, at the
center of the book, a love

00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:14.460
affair between a fairy
princess and a human beings,

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:17.450
so make of that what you will.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:19.690
But I wanted to read you
a bit about the bad ones.

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:23.640
What happens in the novel is
that four very powerful what

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.340
are called dark jinn
manage to reenter

00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.070
our world after a
long absence, and they

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:35.280
acquire world domination
plans, which fortunately

00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.810
they're not that good at.

00:19:37.810 --> 00:19:41.100
The jinn suffer from all kinds
of problems, such as laziness

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.040
and a kind of ADD.

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.144
They can't keep their mind
on anything for very long.

00:19:47.144 --> 00:19:48.810
But I thought I'd
just read you, there's

00:19:48.810 --> 00:19:51.820
a bit-- just since the
classic thing about the genies

00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:54.870
is that you get
them out of bottles,

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:58.080
there actually is one
moment in this novel where

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:03.110
the most powerful of the jinn
who is a gigantic figure called

00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:08.250
[INAUDIBLE] the Great,
is rescued by one

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.930
of the other
characters who recurs

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:15.330
in the book, this conservative
Islamic philosopher called

00:20:15.330 --> 00:20:22.640
[INAUDIBLE], who is anxious to
impose a very doctrinaire-- I

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.550
guess what we might now
call fundamentalist,

00:20:24.550 --> 00:20:25.990
although this is
slightly earlier

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:29.770
that-- vision of the world.

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:37.160
And the jinn and the
philosopher sort of join forces.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:40.490
His adversary is a much
more liberal philosopher

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:41.980
known in the West
as [INAUDIBLE],

00:20:41.980 --> 00:20:44.780
but whose Arab name is Ibn
Rushd, which is actually

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.350
obviously cognates
with my surname.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:50.110
And that was interesting also.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:56.650
But I thought I'd just read
you the bit about the bad guy,

00:20:56.650 --> 00:20:58.470
the sort of villain
of the novel.

00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:04.455
"The grand [INAUDIBLE],
Zumurrud Shah,

00:21:04.455 --> 00:21:07.480
on whose head was
a golden crown,

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.820
taken from the head of a prince
he had accidentally or not so

00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:13.775
accidentally decapitated
once upon a time,

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:16.480
had, at a certain
point in history,

00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.620
become the philosopher
Ghazali's personal jinnia,

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:24.430
a terrifying entity whose name
was too terrifying to utter.

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:27.680
Ghazali was not however
the jinnia's master.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.830
The words "master" and
"servant" are inappropriate when

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:33.430
applied to the relationship
between human beings

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.380
and the jinn, for any service a
jinnia may perform for a human

00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.890
being is a boon rather than
evidence of enslavement,

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:44.680
an act of generosity, or in
the case of a jinnia liberated

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:47.960
from some sort of trap--
a lamp for example--

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:50.110
a gesture of gratitude.

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.860
The story goes that
Ghazali had in fact

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.680
freed Zumurrud
Shah from just such

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.770
a trap, a blue bottle in which
a forgotten sorcerer had trapped

00:21:58.770 --> 00:21:59.960
him.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:02.660
Long, long ago, wandering in
the streets of his native city

00:22:02.660 --> 00:22:06.140
of [INAUDIBLE], Ghazali had
spotted the opaque bottle

00:22:06.140 --> 00:22:09.650
lying abandoned in the heaps
of trash, which unfortunately

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.400
disfigured that old town
of [INAUDIBLE] minarets

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:15.240
and enigmatic walls,
and had intuited

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.510
at once, as philosophers
with the proper training

00:22:18.510 --> 00:22:22.990
are able to intuit, the presence
of a captive spirit therein.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:24.930
He scooped up the
bottle casually,

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:28.430
but with the guilty expression
of a novice burglar,

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.250
and pressing his lips
against the royal blue glass,

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:34.870
whispered a little too loudly
the occult incantation that

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.620
is the required opening for all
dialogues with captured jinn.

00:22:39.620 --> 00:22:43.890
'Jinnia great and jinnia grand,
now I hold you in my hand.

00:22:43.890 --> 00:22:49.020
Tell me e'er I set you free
what reward you'll offer me."

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.570
A miniaturized genie
speaking through glass

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.750
sounds like a talking
mouse in a cartoon.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.480
Many human beings
have been deceived

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:00.140
by this feeble squeaktiy
squeak into swallowing

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.670
the poisoned pill the captive
jinnia will invariably

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:03.750
offer them.

00:23:03.750 --> 00:23:06.930
Ghazali however was
made of sterner stuff.

00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:10.690
This was the jinnia's
reply, 'Never bargain.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:12.410
Let me go.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.060
Weak men bargain.

00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:18.370
Strong men know, those who
freely set me ever more will

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.090
blessed be.'

00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:21.900
But Ghazali knew
the proper retort

00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.220
to this childish deception.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.530
Well, I know your tribe and kin.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.850
Make your promise
while you're in.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:32.480
Without a sacred vow to
keep, only fool lets jinnia

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:36.130
leap.' Zumurrud Shah, knowing
that he had little choice,

00:23:36.130 --> 00:23:40.870
offered the usual
three wishes formula.

00:23:40.870 --> 00:23:44.050
Ghazali replied, sealing
the contract, accepting

00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:47.255
in words that deviated
somewhat from the usual ones,

00:23:47.255 --> 00:23:52.880
'Anytime, 'neath any moon,
I may ask you for a boon.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.560
Any time these one, two, three,
swiftly will fulfill it be.'

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.350
Released, expanding at
once to his full immensity,

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.290
the jinnia was struck by two
things that marked out Ghazali

00:24:05.290 --> 00:24:07.690
as a most unusual mortal.

00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:10.790
Firstly, he did not quail.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.160
Quailing was not
only de rigueur,

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.780
it was also in most cases
the instinctive reaction

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.620
to the sight of Zumurrud
the Great in his dark glory.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.430
However, this mortal,
the grand [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:26.040
noted with some
perplexity, quaileth not.

00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:27.220
That was firstly.

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.940
And secondly, he didn't ask
for something right away.

00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.800
That was unprecedented.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.900
Infinite wealth, a
bigger sexual organ,

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.410
unlimited power--
these wishes were

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.370
at the top of any jinnia's
list of the top demands

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:45.100
of the human male.

00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.780
The human male wishing mind
was surprisingly unimaginative.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.600
But no wish?

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:55.330
The deferral all three wishes?

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:57.260
That was almost indecent.

00:24:57.260 --> 00:25:00.840
'You ask for nothing?'
Zumurrud Shah roared.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.790
'Nothing is a thing I cannot
give.' Ghazali inclined his

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:07.650
philosopher's head and put
a hand around his chin.

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:11.860
'I see that you give to
nothing the quality of a thing.

00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:13.610
Nothing is the thing
that cannot be given,

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.190
precisely because
it is not a thing.

00:25:16.190 --> 00:25:18.620
Yet in your view,
it's not-thingness

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:21.070
is itself a form of thingness.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:22.560
This perhaps we may discuss.'

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.025
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:30.950
Understand, jinnia, that I am
a man of few personal needs.

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.810
I need neither infinite wealth
nor a bigger sexual organ

00:25:33.810 --> 00:25:35.740
nor unlimited power.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:40.640
However, the time may come when
I ask for some larger service.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.470
I'll let you know.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:43.470
In the meantime, be off.

00:25:43.470 --> 00:25:45.480
You're free to go.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.230
'When will this time come?'
Zumurrud Shah demanded.

00:25:48.230 --> 00:25:50.316
I'm going to be busy, you know.

00:25:50.316 --> 00:25:52.950
After being stuck in that bottle
for so long there are many

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:57.470
things to be done.'
'The time will come when

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:01.560
it's time,' Ghazali said
infuriatingly and turned away

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:02.640
to his book.

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:05.790
'I spit upon all philosophers,'
Zumurrud Shah told him,

00:26:05.790 --> 00:26:09.650
'also artists and the rest
of humanity as well.' And he

00:26:09.650 --> 00:26:14.210
whirled himself into a
funnel of rage and was gone.

00:26:14.210 --> 00:26:17.610
And then, time passed.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:19.190
Years passed.

00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:20.970
Decades passed.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.010
And Ghazali was dead, and
with him died the contract,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:27.180
or so the jinnia believed.

00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.970
And the slits between the
world silted up and closed,

00:26:30.970 --> 00:26:34.950
and Zummurd, which is
fairyland, forgot for a time

00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:38.100
all about the world of
men, all about the man

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:40.430
who refused to make a wish.

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:44.380
And centuries passed, and
a new millennium began,

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:47.760
and the seals which separated
the worlds began to break.

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:50.000
And then boom, here he
was again in the world

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.490
of these feeble beings,
and suddenly there

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:55.950
was a voice in his head
commanding his presence,

00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.670
the voice of a dead
man, the voice of dust,

00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:03.030
of less than dust, the voice
of the void in the grave where

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:05.290
the dust of the
dead man had been,

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:09.060
a void that was somehow
animated, somehow

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:11.300
possessed of the
sensibility of the dead man,

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.110
a void that was ordering
him to present itself to be

00:27:14.110 --> 00:27:16.890
told its first great wish.

00:27:16.890 --> 00:27:21.344
And he, having no option,
being bound by the contract,

00:27:21.344 --> 00:27:24.010
even though he intended to argue
that the contract did not apply

00:27:24.010 --> 00:27:28.410
posthumously, he remembered
Ghazali's unusual language--

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:32.370
'anytime, 'neath any moon,
any time these one, two,

00:27:32.370 --> 00:27:36.080
three.' And he knew that as he
had forgotten to insert a death

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:40.400
clause, a detail he should
make it a point to remember

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.850
if at any point in the future
he needed to grant the three

00:27:42.850 --> 00:27:46.530
wishes contract again, the
obligation still lay upon him

00:27:46.530 --> 00:27:51.010
like a shroud, and he had to
do whatever the void desired.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.150
He remembered and
summoned up in a rush all

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.700
his unassuaged rage,
the wrath of a grand

00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.190
[INAUDIBLE] who had spent half
an eternity bottled up in blue

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.200
and conceived the
desire to be avenged

00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.530
against the entire species
from which his captor came.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:09.900
He would rid himself of this
puny obligation to a dead man,

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.930
and then it would be
time for vengeance.

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:16.170
This he swore."

00:28:16.170 --> 00:28:20.820
I'll just finish that
story by leaving out a bit.

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:23.570
This is just how much he
hates the human beings.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.880
"He was the enemy of the human
race because of his contempt

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.470
for human character.

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:30.870
It was as if he took the
complexity of human beings

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.940
as a personal
affront, the maddening

00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:36.160
inconsistency of human beings,
their contradictions, which

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.750
they made no attempt to
wipe out or reconcile,

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.030
their mixture of idealism
and greed, grandeur

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.010
and pettiness, truths and lies.

00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:46.140
They were not to be
taken seriously anymore

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:49.090
than a cockroach deserve
serious consideration.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.160
At best there were toys, and
he was as close as any of them

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:55.470
would ever get to a wanton god,
and he would, if he so chose,

00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:57.870
kill them for their sport.

00:28:57.870 --> 00:29:01.020
In other words, even if the
philosopher Ghazali had not

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:02.980
unleashed him upon the
unsuspecting world,

00:29:02.980 --> 00:29:05.180
he would have unleashed
himself upon it.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.050
His inclination
was in accordance

00:29:07.050 --> 00:29:09.540
with his instructions,
that the instructions

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:12.750
from the dead
philosopher were clear.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:16.435
'Instill fear,'
Ghazali told him.

00:29:16.435 --> 00:29:20.700
'Only fear will move
sinful man towards God.

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.810
Fear is a part of
God in the sense

00:29:22.810 --> 00:29:26.590
that it is that feeble creature
man's appropriate response

00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.120
to the infinite power
and punitive nature

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.610
of the almighty.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.270
One may say that fear
is the echo of God,

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:35.910
and wherever that echo is
heard men fall to their knees

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:37.880
and cry mercy.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.330
In some parts of the earth
God is already feared.

00:29:41.330 --> 00:29:43.500
Don't bother about
those regions.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.980
Go where man's pride
is swollen, where man

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.040
believes himself to be godlike.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.630
Lay waste his arsenals
and flesh pots,

00:29:51.630 --> 00:29:54.740
his temples of technology,
knowledge, and wealth.

00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:57.610
Go also to those
sentimental locations where

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.590
it is said that God is love.

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:01.800
Go and show them the truth.'

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:04.780
'I don't have to agree with you
about God,' replied Zumurrud

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:07.780
Shah 'about his nature
or even his existence.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.850
That is not and never
will be my business.

00:30:09.850 --> 00:30:12.170
In fairyland we do
not speak of religion,

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:14.700
and our daily life there
is utterly alien to life

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.920
on Earth, and if I may
say so, far superior.

00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.330
I can tell that even in death
you are a censorious prude,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.230
so I will not go into details,
although they are juicy.

00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:27.980
At any rate,
philosophy is a subject

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:30.590
of no interest except
to bores, and theology

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:34.000
is philosophy's
more tedious cousin.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.910
I'll leave such
soporific matters

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.690
to you in your dusty
grave, but as to your wish,

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:40.810
I not only accept
it as my command,

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.380
it will be my
pleasure to comply.

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:47.860
With the proviso that as you
are in fact asking for a series

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:51.980
of acts, this will redeem the
entirety of my three wishes

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:52.920
pledge.'

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.047
'Agreed,' the void that
was Ghazali replied.

00:30:56.047 --> 00:30:57.630
If the dead could
giggle with delight,

00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.990
then the dead philosopher
would have chortled with glee.

00:31:00.990 --> 00:31:03.920
The jinn perceived this. 'Why
so mirthful?' he inquired.

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.490
'Unleashing chaos upon
the unsuspecting world

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:07.570
is not a joke.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:12.720
Or is it?' Ghazali was thinking
of his old rival Ibn Rushd.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.390
'My adversary in thought,'
he told Zumurrud Shah,

00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:18.440
'was a poor fool who was
convinced that with the passage

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:22.350
of time human beings would turn
from faith to reason in spite

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:25.250
of all the inadequacies
of the rational mind.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.610
I obviously am of a
different opinion.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.460
I have triumphed
over him many times,

00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.755
yet the argument continues.

00:31:30.755 --> 00:31:33.310
And it is a fine
thing in a battle

00:31:33.310 --> 00:31:36.485
of wits to be in possession
of a secret weapon, an ace

00:31:36.485 --> 00:31:38.450
in the hole to
play, a trump card

00:31:38.450 --> 00:31:40.830
to use at an opportune time.

00:31:40.830 --> 00:31:44.550
In this particular case, mighty
Zumurrud, you are that trump.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:46.580
I relish the fool's
evident discomfiture

00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:49.610
at his further
inevitable defeat.

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:52.640
Philosophers are
children,' the jinnia said.

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.680
'And I've never liked
children myself.'"

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.772
I'll stop there.

00:31:56.772 --> 00:32:00.575
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:07.540
Yeah, a very odd book.

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.300
After that it gets really odd.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:11.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:12.950
So let me just stop there.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:17.026
If you want to talk about--
or we'll just sit here.

00:32:17.026 --> 00:32:18.334
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:23.385 --> 00:32:24.760
All right, we will
just sit here.

00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:25.830
All right, somebody.

00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.200
Yeah, good.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.310
AUDIENCE: In the book,
Geronimo goes back to India

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.880
and laments about the
differences between Bombay

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.380
and Mumbai.

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.240
I was wondering if you
travel to India much now

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.250
and if you could talk
about the differences

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:41.740
now between now and your time.

00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.750
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well yes, I
do go back fairly regular.

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:47.800
As you perhaps know,
there's this kind

00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.840
of joke in India about all of
us who are NRIs, Non-resident

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.926
Indians, that come the winter we
all like homing pigeons return.

00:32:56.926 --> 00:32:58.300
They say, oh, here
you are again.

00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:01.220
Must be that season of the year.

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:01.910
So yes, I do.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:04.990
And I think Bombay
has-- which I still

00:33:04.990 --> 00:33:08.105
persist in calling Bombay in
the way that people in Saigon

00:33:08.105 --> 00:33:14.570
don't call it Ho Chi Minh
City-- it has changed.

00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:19.820
Of course, first of all
it's grown enormously.

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.220
Secondly, of course,
places do change anyway

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:25.830
over a space or period of time.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.840
But I think one of
the ways in which it's

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:31.420
changed that is
saddening is that it

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.870
used to be a city that
prided itself on not having

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:37.130
communal disputes.

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:42.160
The Hindu-Muslim trouble between
people of different traditions

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.470
kind of didn't happen there.

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:47.370
Even at the time of the
independence of India

00:33:47.370 --> 00:33:49.270
and Pakistan and
the partition, when

00:33:49.270 --> 00:33:51.090
there were these
great massacres,

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.000
and in Bombay essentially
nothing happened.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.550
And people lived perfectly
well alongside each other.

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:01.570
And that was true all the time
that I was growing up there.

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.670
It really went on
until about the end

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.980
of the '80s it was like
that, and then gradually

00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:12.270
what happened was the rise
of a Hindu nationalism

00:34:12.270 --> 00:34:16.130
that was more progressive
than anything in the past.

00:34:16.130 --> 00:34:19.000
And the quality of the
city began to change,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.283
and the proof of
that was in 1993

00:34:22.283 --> 00:34:24.449
when there were these series
of terrorist explosions

00:34:24.449 --> 00:34:27.570
across the city.

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:31.090
That was, if you
like, a moment of loss

00:34:31.090 --> 00:34:33.110
of innocence after that.

00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:36.719
And ever since
then, the city has

00:34:36.719 --> 00:34:41.210
been the victim of communal
discord, like anywhere else.

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:43.420
The kind of
exceptionalism of the city

00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:46.710
no longer exists,
and that's a shame.

00:34:50.171 --> 00:34:51.129
It's still my hometown.

00:34:51.129 --> 00:34:52.590
I'm still very fond of it.

00:34:52.590 --> 00:34:57.321
It's just a messier,
slightly nastier place now.

00:34:57.321 --> 00:35:01.490
But everywhere is,
so it's not alone.

00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:02.020
Anyone else?

00:35:08.031 --> 00:35:09.530
AUDIENCE: Let me
preface my question

00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:12.930
by saying that I'm
sorry to say I have not

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.600
read your books in the past.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.310
I'm hoping to remedy that some.

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.260
SALMAN RUSHDIE: OK, good.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.850
If you get infected,
it's a long infection.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:24.750
There's a lot of books to read.

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.000
AUDIENCE: I'll start here
and see where that takes me.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.208
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Go backwards.

00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:29.350
AUDIENCE: Indeed.

00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:32.190
I was intrigued by
your comment that you

00:35:32.190 --> 00:35:34.684
introduced your own
name, in a fashion,

00:35:34.684 --> 00:35:35.850
as a character in this book.

00:35:35.850 --> 00:35:38.000
And I wondered
whether in this book

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.150
or in some of your
previous books

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:42.340
you have likewise
introduced alter egos

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.946
for real personages
in your life.

00:35:44.946 --> 00:35:45.820
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:47.850
Well, first of
all, the reason is

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:53.420
my father, who was in part a
scholar of Arabic and Farsi,

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.770
was very interested in the
philosophy of Ibn Rushd, who

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:01.600
in his time in the 12th century
was a very progressive voice.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.720
He was an Aristotelian
philosopher,

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.970
one of the great
commentators on Aristotle

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.550
whose work enormously influenced
afterwards Western philosophers

00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:14.350
like Thomas Aquinas and so on.

00:36:14.350 --> 00:36:16.900
But he was in his time a
very progressive voice.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:25.100
He argued for the primacy of
reason and logic and science

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:27.840
against blind faith,
and he came up

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:32.890
against the kind of blind
faith advocates of his time.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.230
There actually was a moment in
which he was exiled in disgrace

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:38.636
and his books got burned, so
I felt I had that in common

00:36:38.636 --> 00:36:39.760
with him too, I discovered.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:47.460
Anyway, for obvious reasons I
found him an attractive person.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.860
Not just because
of the main thing,

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:52.060
because my father basically
changed our family

00:36:52.060 --> 00:36:56.806
name to Rushdie because of
his admiration for Ibn Rushd.

00:36:56.806 --> 00:36:58.430
And so that was
obviously a first point

00:36:58.430 --> 00:37:01.160
of entry into finding
out about him.

00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.022
But then I just became
interested in him as him.

00:37:05.022 --> 00:37:07.480
And because at the
center of the book

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:11.510
there's this ongoing
argument between the rational

00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:19.400
and the irrational, between
the world of tolerance

00:37:19.400 --> 00:37:23.270
and the world of intolerance,
between faith and unfaith,

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.700
that all those
oppositions-- which

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.890
may have taken a particular
form right now, if you like,

00:37:30.890 --> 00:37:33.800
in the news, but it's
an ancient opposition.

00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.060
And I wanted to articulate
that in some way,

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:40.320
and he became a very
useful character

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.590
through which to
approach that subject.

00:37:43.590 --> 00:37:47.460
I mean, again, I
did obviously do

00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.720
the reading about the
historical character,

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:53.220
so I do know about him insofar
as we know, whatever we know

00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.570
about him which is
not his life, as is

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:59.280
characteristic of something
that's almost 900 years ago,

00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:01.329
there are gaps in the record.

00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:03.370
But the things that are
known about his life I do

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:05.210
know, and so this
character in the book

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:11.030
is not incompatible with
what is known about his life.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:14.150
But of course, I suspect
he didn't have a love

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:17.270
affair with a fairy princess.

00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:19.710
That may be my invention.

00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:21.210
I'll leave it to you to decide.

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:31.770
My training was as a historian,
so I've always, if you liked,

00:38:31.770 --> 00:38:38.000
had two processes in my thought.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.020
One is a historicist
process, because one

00:38:41.020 --> 00:38:42.949
of the great
questions of history

00:38:42.949 --> 00:38:45.240
is also one of the great
questions of literature, which

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:48.350
is what is the relationship
between the individual

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:51.440
and the world.

00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:53.510
Are we simply the
victims of history,

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:57.790
or do we have the kind of agency
that allows us to make history?

00:38:57.790 --> 00:39:01.520
That question of the
individual's relationship

00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:07.049
to society in general and to
the great events of his time--

00:39:07.049 --> 00:39:08.590
that's something
which as a historian

00:39:08.590 --> 00:39:11.930
you'll always be
asked to consider.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:15.220
And history, as it developed
in the 20th century,

00:39:15.220 --> 00:39:17.550
moved away from a kind
of kings and battles

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:24.000
idea of history to
something more social, what

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.290
was originally called the
Marxist interpretation

00:39:26.290 --> 00:39:28.400
of history, which basically
said that in order

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.720
to understand history you
must look at the people.

00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.440
You must look at how
ordinary life was lived

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:36.970
and what moved the masses
of people and so on.

00:39:36.970 --> 00:39:40.210
And from that arises
the political sphere

00:39:40.210 --> 00:39:42.120
of kings and battles.

00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.300
Anyway, I've always
been interested in that.

00:39:44.300 --> 00:39:47.870
And of course, literature asks
these questions all the time,

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.170
about how does the
individual human being sit

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:53.620
in the context of his time.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:57.580
So for me, I've often
looked for stories

00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:01.360
in which individual human beings
are at a kind of crossroads

00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:02.770
with great events.

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.270
And I try and look at
what they do to the events

00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:09.680
and what the events do to them.

00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.640
So that's one
project in my mind,

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.180
which is if you
like, naturalistic,

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.820
historically based.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.020
And the other project is
this kind of fairytale thing.

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:23.190
And it seems to me that the
two are both very good ways

00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:27.120
of approaching the truth about
human nature and who we are

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:28.710
and what we do to each other.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:31.730
And quite often in my books
I've tried to put them both in.

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:35.030
What happens when you take
both those kinds of discourse

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:37.690
and allow them to
collide with each other?

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:41.010
What sparks does that throw off?

00:40:41.010 --> 00:40:45.160
So yeah, I think in quite a
lot of my books-- not all,

00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.810
but in a lot of
them-- there have

00:40:46.810 --> 00:40:49.920
been one or two historical
figures here and there.

00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:52.550
Not usually in leading roles.

00:40:52.550 --> 00:40:56.330
I haven't written the classic
historical novel the way

00:40:56.330 --> 00:41:01.490
that Gore Vidal wrote
about Lincoln or Burr.

00:41:01.490 --> 00:41:04.750
And Lincoln, actually.

00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:08.280
But history is always
there, very frequently there

00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:09.196
in [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:15.975
AUDIENCE: So I've been
trying to figure out

00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:17.600
how to articulate
the question, but you

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:21.380
had the misfortune of becoming
a historical figure when

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.910
the fatwa against you, and
the victim of fundamentalism

00:41:24.910 --> 00:41:26.580
in a serious way.

00:41:26.580 --> 00:41:28.390
My understanding is
that fundamentalism

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:33.620
is a modern historical event.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:35.637
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well,
in this form it is, yes.

00:41:35.637 --> 00:41:37.970
AUDIENCE: So what I thought
would be interesting to hear

00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:42.460
from you is what do you see
as the history, development,

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:46.909
of this sort of fundamentalism,
and what do we do to--

00:41:46.909 --> 00:41:47.950
SALMAN RUSHDIE: About it?

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:49.390
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:52.542
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, I'm happy
that you asked me to solve

00:41:52.542 --> 00:41:53.750
the most intractable problem.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.698
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.860
Because as it happens, of
course, I have all the answers.

00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:04.430
If only people would ask me, it
would all be fixed very fast.

00:42:07.750 --> 00:42:09.250
Well, first of all
there always has

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:13.360
been-- this argument between
Ghazali and Ibn Rushd

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:16.444
is a very important one.

00:42:16.444 --> 00:42:18.610
Just to be clear, they
didn't live in the same place

00:42:18.610 --> 00:42:19.420
or the same time.

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:22.690
Ghazali lived hundreds of miles
away in a different country,

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.730
and probably almost
a century earlier.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:27.940
But Ghazali wrote
a very famous book

00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.670
called "The Incoherence
of the Philosophers,"

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:33.950
in which he attacked
the philosophy which

00:42:33.950 --> 00:42:37.570
was of the forebears of
Ibn Rushd, philosophers

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:42.140
like Avicenna in the West,
Ibn Sina and [INAUDIBLE] one

00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:47.020
or two others who were
also people who advocated

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:49.750
the use of reason and logic
and science as opposed

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:53.760
to simply bowing down
before the almighty.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:58.620
And Ibn Rushd wrote a
response to that, a book

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.805
with the wonderful title
of "The Incoherence

00:43:00.805 --> 00:43:05.310
of the Incoherence,"
in which he argued

00:43:05.310 --> 00:43:09.200
on behalf of reason
and science and logic

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:10.510
and against blind faith.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:14.580
But that argument, to an extent,
has always been there in Islam.

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:18.540
And as we now see,
the literalists

00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:23.290
seem to have essentially
won that argument.

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.020
But in its modern
form, I don't know.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:31.426
It's certainly not more
than half a century old.

00:43:31.426 --> 00:43:35.670
A certain amount of it
has to do with the rise

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:40.750
from Saudi Arabia
of the Wahhabi cult,

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:43.620
now sometimes also
called Salafist,

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:50.030
which the royal family, the
Sauds, were followers of.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:52.820
And almost nobody
else was until they

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.210
launched this enormous
campaign to propagate

00:43:55.210 --> 00:43:59.200
Wahhabi Islam across the world
by using the gigantic oil

00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:02.972
money to set up schools
and to send preachers

00:44:02.972 --> 00:44:03.680
around the world.

00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:08.420
And so now, Wahhabi Islam has
taken root all over the place

00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:10.940
and is the source of
a lot of the trouble,

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:13.616
because that's a very
fanatical brand of Islam.

00:44:13.616 --> 00:44:14.990
And it's one of
the reasons why I

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.930
keep trying to persuade
people that the Saudis are not

00:44:17.930 --> 00:44:18.430
our friends.

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:26.360
There are also different
reasons in different places

00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:31.200
for the rise of extremism.

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:36.720
In Afghanistan, you can
say that the Taliban are

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.600
kind of a reaction
to and borne out

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:43.680
of the struggle against
the Russian invasion,

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.750
the so-called Mujahideen who
fought against the Russians,

00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:52.320
morphed into the Taliban after
the Russians were expelled.

00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:56.830
In places like Algeria,
what you had was initially

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.050
a very popular and
completely secular

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:00.880
Marxist party of the
revolution, which

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:04.020
had expelled the colonial
power and then take over,

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.790
and then over the
years became fat,

00:45:06.790 --> 00:45:09.820
became complacent
and rich and corrupt.

00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:14.020
And people swung away from
that towards the religious

00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:15.970
extremists as a reaction.

00:45:15.970 --> 00:45:18.790
So it's not the same
thing everywhere.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:22.760
It's a phenomenon that's
developed a lot of momentum

00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.490
but actually arose from
local roots and local places.

00:45:27.490 --> 00:45:31.000
As to the cure, I
really think I'll have

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.200
to admit to not having one.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:38.430
But one of the things I
think that we can notice

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:43.450
is that in those countries
in which fanatical extremist

00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:47.290
Islam has gained the
most power, those

00:45:47.290 --> 00:45:50.860
are also the countries in
which it's most disliked.

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.450
The people of Afghanistan
were not fans of the Taliban.

00:45:55.450 --> 00:45:58.360
The people of Iran, to
a very large extent,

00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:01.870
feel oppressed by the rule
of the ayatollahs, and so on.

00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:06.390
In Algeria, the radical Islamic
groups, the FIS and GIA,

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:11.970
took power but were very rapidly
disliked and fell from power.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:16.720
So maybe if you take
a long historical view

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:18.460
that this is a thing
that is burning

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.870
through the Muslim
world-- I mean,

00:46:21.870 --> 00:46:24.700
ISIS is something else again,
because that's something

00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.380
that hasn't happened before.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:28.490
There's never been an army

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:29.520
Before.

00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:31.910
And this army,
which is recruiting

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.620
from all over the
world and which

00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:39.071
seems to have a lot of funds at
its disposal, partly from-- we

00:46:39.071 --> 00:46:41.320
don't know which governments
are giving money to ISIS,

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.660
but you could have a pretty good
bet in the direction of Saudi

00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:48.170
Arabia and Yemen and Qatar.

00:46:51.970 --> 00:46:53.960
But they also have
seized oil wells,

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.300
and they're selling oil on
the black market and so on.

00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.892
So they're suddenly
very well-funded,

00:46:58.892 --> 00:47:01.100
and they're getting recruits
from all over the world.

00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:04.524
That's a new phenomenon, which
is in a way harder to defeat.

00:47:04.524 --> 00:47:05.940
The other thing,
I think you could

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.130
argue that the other
thing would burn itself,

00:47:09.130 --> 00:47:14.500
because people would
rapidly become disenchanted.

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:18.220
But what's happened in Iraq
is you have a failed state.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:24.970
And in that lawless
place, this new entity

00:47:24.970 --> 00:47:29.150
can present itself as
the law, by brute force

00:47:29.150 --> 00:47:31.010
can present itself as the law.

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:35.850
And that's going to be
very difficult to defeat,

00:47:35.850 --> 00:47:39.770
and I sort of doubt that it
can be defeated by air strikes

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.380
alone.

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:44.611
So yeah, I'll stop
there, which is not

00:47:44.611 --> 00:47:45.860
the place you want me to stop.

00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:48.340
But I don't have the cure.

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:51.884
So that's what I
can say right now.

00:47:51.884 --> 00:47:54.050
AUDIENCE: To shift from
solving the world's problems

00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:58.480
to your writing, you play
with all sorts of ideas.

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.120
You mentioned that you were
worried that you were slipping

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.770
into "I Dream of Jeannie."

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:03.110
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Slipping into what?

00:48:03.110 --> 00:48:03.690
Sorry?

00:48:03.690 --> 00:48:05.720
AUDIENCE: Into "I
Dream of Jeannie."

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.750
Why shouldn't an astronaut
fall into the middle

00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:10.550
of your narrative?

00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:13.730
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, there
ain't no astronauts in here.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:18.600
Larry Hagman is not present, and
there's no harem pants either.

00:48:21.330 --> 00:48:23.540
At the point in which I
realized that there was

00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:26.450
this echo I decided
to make it conscious,

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:27.850
and so there
actually is a moment

00:48:27.850 --> 00:48:30.990
in the book where you'll see
a conscious direct reference

00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:32.890
to that particular thing.

00:48:32.890 --> 00:48:34.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:36.530
I'll leave it to
you to discover it.

00:48:36.530 --> 00:48:39.070
I thought, if you
realize you're doing it

00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:43.540
you may as well let
people know that you know,

00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:47.450
rather than have somebody tell
you as if you didn't know.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.910
I'm very interested
in popular culture.

00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:53.940
I always have been.

00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.830
And I kind of don't make
a distinction really

00:48:56.830 --> 00:48:59.140
between high and low
culture, because I

00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:01.880
think the thing about
being a novelist

00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:03.900
is you have to be very
interested in life

00:49:03.900 --> 00:49:05.340
as it's actually lived.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.990
You have to know what's
really in people's heads.

00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:10.250
What are people
really thinking about,

00:49:10.250 --> 00:49:12.250
and how are they
talking, and so on.

00:49:12.250 --> 00:49:15.650
So you need to know what is
the rubbish in people's heads.

00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:17.900
Otherwise you can't
make them talk properly.

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.350
This is something I take
from writers like Dickens.

00:49:25.350 --> 00:49:27.950
If you think about
Dickens, his novels

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:30.320
go into every part of society.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.320
They go into the slums
and the criminal areas

00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:39.350
and the debtor's prisons, but
they also go into high society

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:40.630
and so on.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:44.820
And he himself, I think,
set out to know-- London

00:49:44.820 --> 00:49:48.430
in particular, but not
only London-- as profoundly

00:49:48.430 --> 00:49:50.560
as he could, to get
into as many rooms

00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:52.530
and into as many
interesting places

00:49:52.530 --> 00:49:56.690
as he could so that afterwards
he had that at his disposal

00:49:56.690 --> 00:49:57.340
to write about.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:59.920
But I think that's exactly
what a writer should do.

00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:02.090
You should try and
learn the world.

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:05.450
Learn what people's
lives are like in places

00:50:05.450 --> 00:50:07.420
which are completely
not like the place where

00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:09.060
you spend your time.

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:11.369
And learn what they think about.

00:50:11.369 --> 00:50:12.160
What do they watch?

00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:14.860
What do they talk about?

00:50:14.860 --> 00:50:17.120
What is the slang of
different generations?

00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:18.120
All of that stuff.

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.680
I think to be a novelist you
have to engage with that.

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.900
So you'll find all
kinds of references

00:50:25.900 --> 00:50:28.350
to popular culture scattered
through this book, as well

00:50:28.350 --> 00:50:30.510
as the egghead stuff.

00:50:30.510 --> 00:50:33.450
But I think that's fine.

00:50:33.450 --> 00:50:39.550
Once upon a time writers
could expect from readers

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:44.970
that readers would have quite a
wide knowledge of, for example,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:50.932
Greek and Roman mythology,
that you could refer to,

00:50:50.932 --> 00:50:56.020
I don't know, the shirt
of Nessus and your readers

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:57.650
would know what you
were talking about,

00:50:57.650 --> 00:51:01.450
that you were talking about
this poisoned shirt that

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:06.830
was given to Hercules
by the widow of somebody

00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:08.800
that he killed, and when
he puts on the shirt,

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:12.170
the shirt begins to
attack him and eat him.

00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:15.860
And you could assume
that your readers

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:18.640
would have a general knowledge
of that kind of mythology.

00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.150
Now they don't, right?

00:51:21.150 --> 00:51:23.920
But there is a
popular mythology,

00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:27.800
which is based on things
like music and television

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.670
and people whose
names begin with K.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:34.500
And you may as well
be aware of that

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:36.810
too, because it becomes a
way of making references

00:51:36.810 --> 00:51:38.380
that people will grasp.

00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.170
So yeah, "I Dream
of Jeannie" as well.

00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:43.920
AUDIENCE: So back to
the world's problems,

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.285
but I won't ask
you to solve them.

00:51:46.285 --> 00:51:47.910
Something I noticed
recently, I started

00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:51.820
reading little bits of more
like ancient literature,

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.790
like Marcus Aurelius
or Epictetus,

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:56.540
like stoic philosophers.

00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.640
I was really struck by
a lot of this really

00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:02.285
applies-- it's about the mind
versus one's circumstances

00:52:02.285 --> 00:52:03.160
and things like that.

00:52:03.160 --> 00:52:07.770
And it seems like a lot of
these issues still apply today.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:09.610
And even just reading
about Roman history,

00:52:09.610 --> 00:52:11.135
it's a lot the same issues.

00:52:11.135 --> 00:52:12.700
We live in much
better circumstances,

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:14.283
I think, than during
the Roman Empire.

00:52:14.283 --> 00:52:15.980
Life is a lot easier,
at least here,

00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.625
than a lot of
places in the world.

00:52:17.625 --> 00:52:20.630
So it seems like the trends are
generally good over centuries

00:52:20.630 --> 00:52:24.110
or millennia, but also in some
ways the stakes are higher,

00:52:24.110 --> 00:52:25.750
the risks are
higher, technology's

00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:28.490
a huge catalyst for
destructive capabilities

00:52:28.490 --> 00:52:32.200
as well as kind of hopefulness
for mankind-- nuclear weapons

00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:34.070
obviously a devastating form.

00:52:34.070 --> 00:52:37.570
So with my very kind
of some simplistic view

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:40.040
of these things,
on one hand things

00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.560
seem to be trending well
for mankind as a whole,

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:45.640
but also there's
some greater risks

00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:47.220
which do seem
unique to our times

00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:50.390
and potentially like the
genie's out of the bottle.

00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:53.690
It's like these things
can't go back in.

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:55.190
How do you think
about these things?

00:52:55.190 --> 00:53:00.220
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Well, I agree
with most of what you said.

00:53:00.220 --> 00:53:02.990
I mean, clearly,
there's a way of writing

00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:07.840
about the modern world which
would be very dystopic.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:10.380
You could argue that the
world is in bad shape,

00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:14.570
and it's going to get worse
and probably will end badly.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:19.100
And it would have been easy
to write this book like that.

00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:21.310
But for that reason, I
didn't want to do it.

00:53:21.310 --> 00:53:23.300
Because again, one of
the things that you

00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:27.550
do learn which is very useful to
know from the study of history

00:53:27.550 --> 00:53:30.320
is that history is
not set on timelines.

00:53:30.320 --> 00:53:32.100
It is not inevitable.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:33.790
It's not determinist.

00:53:33.790 --> 00:53:37.580
It very often-- almost
always, frankly-- does not

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:39.800
go in the direction you
think it's going to go.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.050
There are strange
left turns and night

00:53:42.050 --> 00:53:44.960
moves and unexpected
developments,

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.080
for better or worse.

00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:47.370
It can be either way.

00:53:50.070 --> 00:53:52.920
So it's a very good idea not
to see the future as inevitable

00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:57.390
or set, because it isn't.

00:53:57.390 --> 00:54:03.430
Put it like this-- if in January
of 1989 I had told you guys

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:06.460
that the Soviet Union would
not exist by Christmas,

00:54:06.460 --> 00:54:09.830
you would probably have thought
I was crazy, because it seemed

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.470
crazy to say such a thing.

00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:13.690
And yet, within a very
few months-- actually,

00:54:13.690 --> 00:54:16.937
within a very few weeks--
it just blew away.

00:54:16.937 --> 00:54:18.520
I mean, the fact
that there's somebody

00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:22.950
trying to put it back
together now is another story.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:24.935
But that's what I'm
saying, that there

00:54:24.935 --> 00:54:29.500
can be gigantic changes in
world conditions at very, very

00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.220
high speed.

00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:33.370
Especially, I feel, that we
live in a very accelerated time,

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.140
in which the rate of
change is probably greater

00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:39.456
than it's ever been
in human history.

00:54:39.456 --> 00:54:43.680
I was just thinking
that within my memory,

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:49.470
the gesture for a telephone
has changed three times.

00:54:49.470 --> 00:54:51.160
When you used to
say "call me," you

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.850
would make a dialing gesture.

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:56.200
Then when phones
became a bit modern,

00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:58.820
you would make a
pushing buttons gesture.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.310
And now you do that.

00:55:00.310 --> 00:55:03.710
So just if you look at
something like the telephone,

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:06.150
the rate of transformation
has been great.

00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:10.350
There's also-- you
remember fax machines?

00:55:10.350 --> 00:55:13.130
I remember when fax machines
arrived and somebody

00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:15.100
said to me, you should
have a fax machine.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.475
I thought, why
should I have one?

00:55:16.475 --> 00:55:19.910
Because nobody else I know has
one, so there's nobody to fax.

00:55:19.910 --> 00:55:21.570
And then suddenly
everybody had one,

00:55:21.570 --> 00:55:23.920
and now once again
nobody has one.

00:55:23.920 --> 00:55:29.540
So when you live in a world
that's changing like that,

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:32.190
it can go anywhere.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.780
And I don't think anybody
can foretell how it will go.

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:39.500
So I wanted to
suggest in the book--

00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.260
I'm not going to tell you
what happens at the end,

00:55:42.260 --> 00:55:44.480
but it ends in a
future which may

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:47.180
be at the moment we don't
have any right to believe

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:49.780
might happen.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:51.220
That doesn't it won't.

00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:52.650
I just wanted to
invent something

00:55:52.650 --> 00:55:56.480
else other than the
inevitable, because

00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:59.910
in my vieww-- futurology
has become a big thing now.

00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:01.730
People try to
predict directions,

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:04.930
and my view is futurology
is the science of being

00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:08.130
wrong about the future.

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:12.650
Think about the film
"2001 A Space Odyssey."

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:14.930
Look at how people
dress in that film.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:18.520
They all wear kind of
Pierre Cardin jumpsuits,

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.890
and that's not what's happening.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:28.350
No matter how brilliantly
you foresee the future--

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:30.810
I mean, all science fiction
that talks about the future

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:33.420
is really talking
about the present.

00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.940
"1984" was really
talking about 1948,

00:56:36.940 --> 00:56:38.710
and the only reason
he called it "1984"

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:40.645
was because it's the
last two digits reversed.

00:56:43.340 --> 00:56:47.760
So literature of the
future uses the future

00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:53.230
as a way to make an allegory or
a myth about the present day.

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:57.510
And so it's better to say, OK,
we don't know what's coming.

00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:59.680
But let's not assume the worst.

00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:01.120
Let's not assume
the best, either.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:02.630
I mean, let's not be stupid.

00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:05.690
But the worst is not inevitable.

00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:09.600
And I just wanted to have
that thought in the book.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.150
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:11.740
I first of all
wanted to say thank

00:57:11.740 --> 00:57:12.970
you so much for being here.

00:57:12.970 --> 00:57:14.150
It's been an honor
hearing you speak.

00:57:14.150 --> 00:57:15.858
I've been a fan of
yours for a long time.

00:57:15.858 --> 00:57:18.550
Actually, I first picked up
"Haroun and the Sea of Stories"

00:57:18.550 --> 00:57:22.150
when I was about 11,
and my mind was opened.

00:57:22.150 --> 00:57:23.230
I loved it so much.

00:57:23.230 --> 00:57:25.740
I thought, hey, let's see what
else this author has written.

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.198
Picked up "The Satanic Verses"
and had a slightly different

00:57:28.198 --> 00:57:30.511
experience at age 12.

00:57:30.511 --> 00:57:33.250
SALMAN RUSHDIE: Yeah,
that may not be the age.

00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:35.580
AUDIENCE: No, it might not
have been quite aimed at me.

00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:37.302
But actually, that's
part of my question,

00:57:37.302 --> 00:57:38.760
is you do have a
few books that are

00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.455
aimed towards younger readers.

00:57:40.455 --> 00:57:43.040
And I'm wondering what sort
of considerations do you have

00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.554
when writing a book for
children than for adults?

00:57:46.554 --> 00:57:47.970
SALMAN RUSHDIE:
Well, first of all

00:57:47.970 --> 00:57:49.355
they're not for little children.

00:57:49.355 --> 00:57:50.830
They're kind of
young adult books.

00:57:50.830 --> 00:57:53.100
They're aimed at sort of 11, 12.

00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.010
These days, of course,
kids grow up younger.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:58:01.960
So 11, 12-year-olds
now are kind of 18.

00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:05.900
And basically two of them
were written one each

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.660
for my two sons.

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.280
But I think kids now-- I
mean, children's literature

00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:16.060
takes on very rough themes.

00:58:16.060 --> 00:58:18.460
There's a lot of young
adult books which

00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:25.180
deal with violence and child
abuse and drugs and et cetera,

00:58:25.180 --> 00:58:28.820
and kids seem to be able
to do to deal with that.

00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:33.410
So I think kids are much more
able to deal with stuff than we

00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:35.570
think sometimes.

00:58:35.570 --> 00:58:37.570
These books are not like that.

00:58:37.570 --> 00:58:39.820
They're more-- in
a way, this book

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:42.280
is like "Haroun" for grownups.

00:58:42.280 --> 00:58:44.020
It's in the same
neck of the woods.

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:51.030
The great writer EB White, who
wrote "Charlotte's Web" and so

00:58:51.030 --> 00:58:55.290
on, famously said you don't
write down to children,

00:58:55.290 --> 00:58:57.060
you write up.

00:58:57.060 --> 00:59:01.050
And it's true that children
are very, very tough readers.

00:59:01.050 --> 00:59:04.670
If they don't like a book,
they do not finish the book.

00:59:04.670 --> 00:59:11.240
Sometimes they think put
it down quite roughly.

00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:13.665
There's a great line of
Dorothy Parker's when

00:59:13.665 --> 00:59:16.040
she didn't like a book, and
she said this book should not

00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:17.850
be put down, it should
be thrown across the room

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:18.558
with great force.

00:59:18.558 --> 00:59:20.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:23.970
And children will do that.

00:59:23.970 --> 00:59:27.355
Children will write to you
and tell you what they like,

00:59:27.355 --> 00:59:31.464
but they will also write and
tell you what they don't like.

00:59:31.464 --> 00:59:33.380
One of the great pleasures
of writing "Haroun"

00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:36.970
was that I would get
these bundles of letters

00:59:36.970 --> 00:59:40.110
where an entire classroom
somewhere had read the book,

00:59:40.110 --> 00:59:42.550
and they would send me
drawings of the characters

00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:47.780
and tips for sequels, and which
characters they liked best

00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:49.620
and which ones they
didn't, and so on.

00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.610
And it was wonderful
reader response.

00:59:55.310 --> 00:59:58.160
I think the only
question that is

00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.960
different from
writing for adults

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.050
is there are issues of a
category, where sometimes

01:00:05.050 --> 01:00:08.600
you'll use a simple word instead
of a more complicated word.

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.310
But on the other hand, kids
like complicated words.

01:00:11.310 --> 01:00:15.900
They like to sort of walk around
saying four-syllable words,

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:18.280
because it makes them feel good.

01:00:18.280 --> 01:00:23.840
And sometimes I would
cut a sentence in half

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:26.220
and have two short sentences
rather than one long one.

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:31.820
But really, just writing
really in the end.

01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:35.880
It didn't require that
much of a change of gear.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:42.030
Because the form of the fable,
which I guess what "Haroun" is,

01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:45.150
is notable because the
fable classically uses

01:00:45.150 --> 01:00:49.410
very simple language to say
things which are not simple.

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:53.360
That's what makes it
a beautiful vehicle.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.630
So again, if you're
writing in that vein,

01:00:57.630 --> 01:01:00.020
the point is to write
a simple story that

01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.947
ends up not being simple.

01:01:01.947 --> 01:01:04.530
So in that sense you don't have
to worry too much about issues

01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:07.620
of language or form, because
the form itself dictates

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.300
that kind of simplicity.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.800
So yeah, it was fun to do.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.340
I've done two.

01:01:13.340 --> 01:01:16.350
If I had a third
child, I'd do three.

01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:18.380
But I might have to find
somebody else's child

01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:19.630
to do one for.

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:22.490
I'm a great believer
in the Rule of Three,

01:01:22.490 --> 01:01:24.770
and I've only done two.

01:01:24.770 --> 01:01:26.970
And one of the things,
because I never

01:01:26.970 --> 01:01:31.540
had a daughter both of
those are books about boys.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.420
And I'd quite like to do one
in which the main character was

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:35.890
female rather than male.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:39.600
So maybe that'll show
up at some point.

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.170
OK, I think we have to stop.

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:42.230
Thank you very much.

01:01:42.230 --> 01:01:46.180
