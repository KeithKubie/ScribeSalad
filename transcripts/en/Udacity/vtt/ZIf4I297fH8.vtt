00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:03.330
So, the characteristic of ensemble learning is first this, that

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.820
you take a bunch of simple rules, all of which kind

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.400
of make sense and you can see as sort of helping.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.470
But on their own, individually, do not give you a good

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:14.830
answer. And then you magically combine them in some way to

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.620
create a more complex rule, that in fact, works really well.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.450
And ensemble learning algorithms have a sort of basic form to

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.100
them, that can be described in just one or two lines.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.520
So let me do that and then we can start wondering a little bit

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.370
how we're going to make that real. So here's the basic form of an ensemble

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:32.689
learning algorithm. Basically you learn over a

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.690
subset of the data, and that generates

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.400
some kind of a rule. And then you learn over another subset of the data

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.500
and that generates a different rule. And then you learn over another subset of

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.190
the data and that generates yet a third rule, and yet a fourth rule, and

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.760
yet a fifth rule, and so on and so forth. And then eventually you

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.490
take all of those rules and you combine them into one of these complex rules.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.920
So, we might imagine in the email case that I might

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.310
look at a small subset of email that I know is already

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.000
spam and discover that the word manly shows up in all of

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.660
them and therefore pick that up as a rule. That's going to be

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.790
good at that subset of mail, but not necessarily be good

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.350
at the other subset of mail. And do the same thing and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.500
discover that a lot of the spam mails are in fact short

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.970
or a lot of them are just images or just urls and

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.530
so on and so forth. And that's how I

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.550
learn these rules by looking at different subsets. Which

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.630
is why you end up with rules that are very good at a small set of the data, but

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.710
aren't necessarily good at a large set of the

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.410
data. And then after you've collected these rules, you combine

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.320
them in some way, and there you go. And

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.080
that's really the beginning and the end of ensemble learning.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.740
&gt;&gt; So wait. So, when you say manly was in a lot of the positive

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.370
examples. Do you mean like it distinguishes the

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.040
positive and the negative example? So it should

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740
also not be in the negative examples.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.840
&gt;&gt; That's right. That's exactly right. So think of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.360
this as any other classification learning problem that you

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.660
would have where you're trying to come up with

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.869
some way to distinguish between the positives and the negatives.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.890
&gt;&gt; And, and now why does it, why are we are looking at subsets of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.710
the data? I don't understand why we can't just look at all, the whole data.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.060
&gt;&gt; Well, if we look at all of the data,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.940
then it's going to be hard to come up with these, these

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.270
simple rules. That's the basic answer. Actually, ask me that

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.260
question a little bit later, when we talk about overfitting,

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:08.530
and I think I'll have a good answer for you. Okay,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.979
so here we go Michael. This is Ensemble Learning. You learn

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.440
over a subset of the data over and over again picking

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.280
up new rules and then you combine them and you're done.
