00:00:00.418 --> 00:00:03.298
- [Voiceover] Let's say that
we have a function, f of x,

00:00:03.298 --> 00:00:07.465
and it is equal to negative
four times the cube root

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:11.808
times the cube root of x.

00:00:11.808 --> 00:00:14.141
And what we want to do
is we want to evaluate

00:00:14.141 --> 00:00:17.544
the derivative of our function
when x is equal to eight.

00:00:17.544 --> 00:00:19.755
So see if you can figure this out.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:22.181
All right, now this might
look foreign to you.

00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:23.552
You might say, well, I've
never taken a derivative

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:25.738
of a cube root before, but as we'll see,

00:00:25.738 --> 00:00:28.650
we can actually just
apply the power rule here.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.715
Because this function can be rewritten as,

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:35.538
so f of x can be rewritten
as negative four.

00:00:35.538 --> 00:00:37.453
The cube root of x is the same thing as

00:00:37.453 --> 00:00:39.933
x to the one-third power.

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.404
And now it might be a little bit clearer

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:43.095
that we can apply the power rule.

00:00:43.095 --> 00:00:45.592
We could take this one-third, multiply it

00:00:45.592 --> 00:00:48.158
by this co-efficient, negative four.

00:00:48.158 --> 00:00:51.846
So we have negative four times one-third,

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:55.263
and you have times x to the one-third.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:00.201
We just decrement that exponent to,

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:01.664
that's a different shade of blue,

00:01:01.664 --> 00:01:04.414
to the one-third minus one power.

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:08.470
This is the derivative.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.470
So f prime of x is equal to that,

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.950
and so now we just have to simplify.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.533
This is equal negative
four-thirds times x.

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:21.909
One-third minus one is
negative two-thirds power.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.860
And so if we want to
evaluate f prime of eight,

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:29.536
f prime of eight is equal
to negative four-thirds

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:33.286
times eight to the
negative two-thirds power.

00:01:35.856 --> 00:01:39.180
Well that's the same thing
as negative four-thirds

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
times eight, eight to the one-third,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.232
and then raise that to negative two power.

00:01:48.232 --> 00:01:49.715
I'm just using exponent properties here.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:51.598
If this looks completely
unfamiliar how I got

00:01:51.598 --> 00:01:52.753
from that to that, I encourage you

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:55.427
to review exponent
properties on Khan Academy.

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:58.747
Well eight to the
one-third, that is just two.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:02.881
So this is just two, and then
two to the negative two power.

00:02:02.881 --> 00:02:04.700
Remember, let me just
take some steps here.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.919
It's a good review.

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:09.742
This is equal to negative four-thirds

00:02:09.742 --> 00:02:13.445
times two to the negative
two is the same thing

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.695
as one over two to the two.

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:18.763
These two things are equivalent.

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:20.422
That and that.

00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:22.269
One over two to the two is the same thing

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.658
as two to the negative two.

00:02:23.658 --> 00:02:26.186
So this is one over four,

00:02:26.186 --> 00:02:28.915
and so this is going to simplify to

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.517
negative one over three.

00:02:31.517 --> 00:02:34.517
Is equal to negative one over three,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.403
and we are done.
