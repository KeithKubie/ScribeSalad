00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:11.150
[Music]

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.770 position:97%
Article I of the U.S. Constitution grants all legislative powers

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.780 position:97%
to a bicameral Congress: a House of Representatives and a Senate

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.860 position:80%
that are the result of a "Great Compromise" seeking

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.390 position:69%
to balance the effects of popular majorities

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.970
with the interests of the states.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.420 position:92%
Our system currently provides for a two-year term of office

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.940 position:91%
for House members from the 435 population-based districts.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.350 position:86%
In the Senate, voters of each state elect two Senators,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.940 position:95%
who serve 6-year terms that overlap (such that only one-third

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.300 position:98%
of the chamber is up for election in any given election cycle).

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.810 position:63%
The two chambers are fundamentally equal

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.150 position:64%
in their legislative roles and functions.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.980 position:77%
Only the House can originate revenue legislation,

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.570 position:83%
and only the Senate confirms presidential nominations

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.000 position:63%
and approves treaties, but the enactment

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.300 position:98%
of law always requires both chambers to separately agree to the same bill

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.880 position:86%
in the same form before presenting it to the President.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.410 position:83%
Because each chamber has the constitutional authority

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.730
to make its own rules, the House

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.050 position:78%
and Senate have developed some very different ways

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.470 position:81%
of processing legislation, perhaps partially flowing

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.120 position:59%
from their constitutional differences.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.310 position:97%
In general, House rules and practices allow a numerical majority

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.940 position:66%
to process legislation relatively quickly.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.720 position:97%
Senate rules and procedures, on the other hand, favor deliberation

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.100 position:97%
over quick action, as they provide significant procedural leverage

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.170
to individual Senators.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.050 position:89%
Congressional action is typically planned and coordinated

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.920 position:98%
by party leaders in each chamber, who have been chosen by members

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.310 position:98%
of their own caucus or conference - that is, the group of members

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.320 position:67%
in a chamber who share a party affiliation.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.410 position:89%
Majority party leaders in the House have important powers

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.300 position:97%
and prerogatives to effectively set the policy agenda and decide

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.560 position:77%
which proposals will receive floor consideration.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420 position:98%
In the Senate, the leader of the majority party is generally expected

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.410 position:81%
to propose items for consideration, but formal tools

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.420 position:86%
that allow a numerical majority to take action are few.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.540 position:92%
Instead, majority party leadership typically must negotiate

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.150 position:81%
with minority party leaders (and often all Senators)

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.390 position:67%
to effectively conduct Senate floor action.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.100 position:84%
In both chambers, much of the policy expertise resides

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.940 position:97%
in the standing committees - panels of members from both parties

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.990 position:66%
that typically take the lead in developing

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.590
and assessing legislation.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.100 position:88%
Members typically serve on a small number of committees,

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.480
often for many years, allowing them

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680 position:86%
to become highly knowledgeable in certain policy areas.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.160 position:95%
All committees are chaired by a member of the majority party,

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.970 position:98%
though chairs often work closely with the committee's ranking member,

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.810 position:97%
the most senior member of the minority party on the committee.

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.340 position:75%
In almost all cases, the ratio of majority party

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.620
to minority party members

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.460 position:91%
on a committee roughly reflects the overall partisan ratio

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.680
in the congressional chamber.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.380 position:97%
Committee members and staff focus much of their time on drafting

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.350 position:94%
and considering legislative proposals, but committees engage

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.700
in other activities, as well.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.220 position:97%
Once law is enacted, Congress has the prerogative and responsibility

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.150 position:72%
to provide oversight of policy implementation,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.460 position:75%
and its committees take the lead in this effort.

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.730 position:97%
Both chambers provide their committees with significant powers

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.560 position:94%
and latitude for oversight and investigations into questions

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.010
of public policy and its effects.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.010 position:97%
While the engine of legislative ideas and action is Congress itself,

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.860 position:97%
the President has influence in the legislative process, as well.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:11.290 position:97%
The President recommends an annual budget for federal agencies

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.670
and often suggests legislation.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.250
Perhaps more significantly,

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.020 position:81%
the power to veto legislation can affect the content

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:22.110
of bills passed by Congress.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.270 position:98%
Since it is quite unusual for law to be enacted over a presidential veto,

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.390 position:94%
Congress typically must accommodate the president's position

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.880
on proposed policies.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.830 position:95%
The process by which a bill becomes law is rarely predictable

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.150 position:70%
and can vary significantly from bill to bill.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.720 position:98%
In fact, for many bills, the process will not follow the sequence

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.860 position:89%
of congressional stages that are often understood to make

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.450
up the legislative process.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.510 position:56%
The presentations on specific topics

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:58.040 position:98%
that follow present a more detailed look at each of the common stages

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.000 position:97%
through which a bill may move, but keep in mind that complications

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.080
and variations abound in practice.
