this is a long time ago I've seen a lot
of changes here and as Carnegie Mellon

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.260
of changes here and as Carnegie Mellon
 

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.810
of changes here and as Carnegie Mellon
and Pittsburgh have changed and I've

00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:23.820
and Pittsburgh have changed and I've
 

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:25.700
and Pittsburgh have changed and I've
been just wondrously witnessing that

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:25.710
been just wondrously witnessing that
 

00:20:25.710 --> 00:20:28.640
been just wondrously witnessing that
there is one thing that is very special

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:28.650
there is one thing that is very special
 

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.960
there is one thing that is very special
which is the Carnegie Mellon and

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:29.970
which is the Carnegie Mellon and
 

00:20:29.970 --> 00:20:33.680
which is the Carnegie Mellon and
Pittsburgh are the only places for the

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:33.690
Pittsburgh are the only places for the
 

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.360
Pittsburgh are the only places for the
kind of work that I wish to do there is

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:35.370
kind of work that I wish to do there is
 

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:37.310
kind of work that I wish to do there is
nowhere else that this work could happen

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:37.320
nowhere else that this work could happen
 

00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:38.960
nowhere else that this work could happen
and I want to just give you a few

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:38.970
and I want to just give you a few
 

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:40.460
and I want to just give you a few
minutes on explaining why that is by

00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:40.470
minutes on explaining why that is by
 

00:20:40.470 --> 00:20:41.480
minutes on explaining why that is by
talking about some of the stakeholders

00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:41.490
talking about some of the stakeholders
 

00:20:41.490 --> 00:20:43.640
talking about some of the stakeholders
and I really mean it this is not

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:43.650
and I really mean it this is not
 

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:45.800
and I really mean it this is not
pandering to CMU at Pittsburgh this is

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:45.810
pandering to CMU at Pittsburgh this is
 

00:20:45.810 --> 00:20:48.380
pandering to CMU at Pittsburgh this is
what makes this place uh truly unique

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:48.390
what makes this place uh truly unique
 

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:52.100
what makes this place uh truly unique

those classes the students at Carnegie
 

00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:07.130
those classes the students at Carnegie
Mellon have blown me away because they

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140
Mellon have blown me away because they
 

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.870
Mellon have blown me away because they
are not students that sit in the classes
