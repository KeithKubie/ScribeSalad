00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:02.710
What I have depicted
right over here

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:05.810
is a fairly typical
Sn2 reaction.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:07.640
We see this hydroxide.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.730
It substitutes this bromine.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.190
It becomes a hydroxyl group.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.570
The bromine takes-- so it gives
this pair to form this bond.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.660
Then this bond in both of those
electrons go to the bromine,

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.660
and now that becomes
the bromide anion.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.220
So we've seen this
multiple times.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.280
But what I want to really
study in this video,

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:32.680
is what happens to the
handedness of these molecules

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.700
or to the molecule
right over here,

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.430
I guess you could
say to the substrate,

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.580
although obviously, one group
gets substituted with another.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.820
So let's name this
thing right over here.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.980
So if we start counting at
this carbon-- 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.600
Four-carbon backbone,
it is all single bonds.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.485
This is a butane.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.750
And then it has a bromine
at the number 2 carbon.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.618
So this is 2-bromobutane.

00:01:02.618 --> 00:01:04.159
So let me write
this-- 2-bromobutane.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.230
And then after this
reaction, it becomes--

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.180
so once again, we still
have four carbons,

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.940
but now, instead
of a bromyl group,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.530
we have a hydroxyl group,
which makes this an alcohol.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.330
So instead of just
calling it butane,

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.630
we would now call
it butanol because

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.420
of this hydroxyl
group right over here.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.260
Butanol right here,
and the hydroxyl group

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.080
is attached to the 1, 2.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.259
So this is 1, 2 carbon,
So this is 2-butanol.

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.800
But what I really
want to think about

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.930
is the chirality,
or the handedness.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.620
And we see here, this
carbon, in both cases,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.190
it is a chiral carbon.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.210
The four things
that it is bonded to

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.570
are all different-- a bromine,
a CH3, a hydrogen, and then

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.280
you could kind of view
this as a ethyl group.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.630
It's bonded to two
carbons right over here.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:02.960
So these are all different.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.501
So we can think
about its handedness.

00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:07.340
Same here, bonded to
four different things.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.570
So whenever you're
thinking about chirality,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.390
the convention is take
the thing that it's

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.490
bonded to that has the
lowest atomic number

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.940
and put that in the back.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.450
Well, hydrogen has the
lowest atomic number

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.037
out of all of these four things.

00:02:20.037 --> 00:02:22.120
So you could imagine that
being put into the back.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.828
And in fact, it's
already drawn that way.

00:02:23.828 --> 00:02:26.650
So it's kind of going
into the screen.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.310
So we'll focus on these
three things right out here.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.040
And the convention is,
start with the thing that

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.211
has the highest atomic number.

00:02:35.211 --> 00:02:37.210
And the thing that has
the highest atomic number

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.570
is the bromine out
of the four things

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.930
that this chiral
carbon is bonded to,

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.760
and then go in the
order-- and then

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.839
rotate in the order of where the
next highest atomic number is.

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.380
Well, you say, well, you have
a carbon there, a carbon there.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.080
They have the same
atomic number.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.960
But then you go to what it's
bonded to for the tie breaker.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.570
And this is bonded
to three hydrogens.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.100
This is bonded to two hydrogens
and then another carbon.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.300
So this extra carbon breaks
that atomic number tiebreaker

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.910
so we go in this direction.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.090
We go in this direction
right over here.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.590
And the way I think about it
is what's happening at the top.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.240
Well, we're moving to the right.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.570
We are moving in the
clockwise directions.

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.192
So we would call this
R-- R-2-bromobutane.

00:03:20.192 --> 00:03:22.650
And we have other videos, where
we go into much more detail

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.310
about naming chiral molecules.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.560
But I like to think about
what's happening at the top.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.340
R, my little mnemonic in
my head is R for right.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.970
R-2-bromobutane is
right over here.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.010
Now let's think about
what's going on over here.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.200
Once again, put the
hydrogen in the back.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.820
It has the lowest atomic number.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.630
And so we'll focus on the
carbons and the oxygen.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.180
Out of carbons
and oxygen, oxygen

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.140
has the highest atomic number.

00:03:50.826 --> 00:03:53.200
And then we'll move in the
direction of the next highest.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.360
Well, once again, the
CH2CH3, the C's have

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.420
the same atomic number,
but then the tiebreaker

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.080
is when you think about
what it's bonded to.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.455
This is bonded to
another carbon,

00:04:01.455 --> 00:04:03.070
while this is all hydrogens.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.714
So we move in this direction,
or counterclockwise direction.

00:04:09.714 --> 00:04:11.130
In our chirality
naming convention

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.070
is we would say
S, S for sinister.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.820
S-2-butanol.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.750
Now, the whole reason why I
went through this exercise

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.170
is to show you that it is
Sn2 reaction, the handedness,

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.730
the chirality has
changed for the molecule.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.930
You can imagine that
this-- if you imagine

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.540
that over here
this 2-bromobutane,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.881
if this was an umbrella,
where the bromine is kind

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.380
of the handle and this is kind
of an upward-turned umbrella,

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.140
all of a sudden the
nucleophile comes in,

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.200
the leaving group pops off,
and then the umbrella pops off

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.940
or the umbrella goes
in the other direction.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.350
It has kind of changed.

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.220
Because the nucleophile's
coming from the left side,

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.100
the leaving group is
leaving from the right,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.647
it has changed its handedness.

00:04:58.647 --> 00:05:00.230
And the reason why
this is interesting

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.180
is, well, OK, it's
an SN2 reaction.

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.100
This now changed.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.922
I went from R to S.
In an Sn1 reaction,

00:05:06.922 --> 00:05:08.630
as we'll see, because
in an Sn1, reaction

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.540
the nucleophile
leaves on its own,

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.110
And then the nucleo-- sorry,
the leaving group leaves

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.375
on its own, and then the
nucleophile comes in,

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:17.740
and it could come
in from any side.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.080
So with an Sn1
reaction, you get a mix.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.560
You might switch
handedness or you might not

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.330
switch handedness.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.150
So the whole point
of this video is

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.524
to get you a little bit more--
thinking a little bit more

00:05:26.524 --> 00:05:28.500
about this about the
stereochemistry chemistry

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:32.078
and the handedness
of Sn2 reactions.
