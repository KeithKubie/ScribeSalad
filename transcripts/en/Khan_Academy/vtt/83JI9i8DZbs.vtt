00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.369
- [Narrator] In the
last video we discussed

00:00:02.369 --> 00:00:05.864
how the Portuguese began to really expand

00:00:05.864 --> 00:00:08.494
their exploration around Africa

00:00:08.494 --> 00:00:10.891
with the invention of the caravel,

00:00:10.891 --> 00:00:14.388
a fast new ship that
could sail into the wind,

00:00:14.388 --> 00:00:18.428
and how Spain, newly united
with Ferdinand and Isabella,

00:00:18.428 --> 00:00:23.369
completed its campaign to
expel Muslims from Spain,

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.247
the Reconquista, in 1492
and began to look outward

00:00:28.247 --> 00:00:31.527
for an opportunity to
compete with Portugal.

00:00:31.527 --> 00:00:34.265
And it was into that
moment that they received

00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:36.828
an interesting proposal
from this man here,

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.299
Christopher Columbus.

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:40.028
So who was Christopher Columbus?

00:00:40.028 --> 00:00:41.910
Well, he was a navigator.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410
He was born around 1451 we think in Genoa,

00:00:47.145 --> 00:00:49.378
which is today in Italy.

00:00:49.378 --> 00:00:52.878
And he had sailed quite a bit in his life.

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:57.218
He was also a voracious
reader thanks to the invention

00:00:57.218 --> 00:01:00.087
of the printing press back in 1450.

00:01:00.087 --> 00:01:02.329
And one book that he
read with great interest

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.263
was the account of Marco Polo
and his travels in China.

00:01:07.263 --> 00:01:10.851
And Columbus dreamt of getting to China

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:14.518
and there accessing
riches, silk and spices,

00:01:16.516 --> 00:01:20.112
and maybe even converting
people living in Asia

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:23.529
to Christianity, and teaming up with them

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:31.551
in a new crusade to expel
Muslims from the Middle East.

00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:33.835
Now there are two common
myths about Columbus

00:01:33.835 --> 00:01:35.328
that I'd like to dispel.

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:39.253
One of these is that Columbus
was the first European

00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:41.336
to discover the Americas.

00:01:44.514 --> 00:01:47.431
In fact we know that around 1000 CE

00:01:51.407 --> 00:01:55.157
the vikings of Norway
had colonized Greenland

00:01:56.773 --> 00:02:00.523
and had explored around
what is today Canada.

00:02:01.875 --> 00:02:06.340
So you might be asking,
"Okay, well if the vikings

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.450
"discovered America, why
aren't we talking about

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.468
"the vikings in this video?"

00:02:11.468 --> 00:02:14.402
And the short answer is
the viking settlement

00:02:14.402 --> 00:02:17.453
in the Americas did not last very long,

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:19.345
less than a generation.

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:23.921
And it also didn't really get
well known outside of Norway,

00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:28.362
so it didn't have the worldwide
impact on colonization

00:02:28.362 --> 00:02:31.664
that Columbus's voyage would have.

00:02:31.664 --> 00:02:34.548
The other myth about
Columbus is that he was

00:02:34.548 --> 00:02:38.941
the lone visionary who knew
that the world was round.

00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:42.946
Everybody else thought
that the world was flat

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:45.493
and Columbus proved them wrong.

00:02:45.493 --> 00:02:49.421
In fact most learned people
had known that the world

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:52.656
was round since the time
of the ancient Greeks.

00:02:52.656 --> 00:02:55.678
What they thought instead
was that the world was simply

00:02:55.678 --> 00:02:56.888
too big.

00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:01.080
They estimated that it
was about 25,000 miles

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.111
in circumference, which is
pretty close to the truth,

00:03:05.111 --> 00:03:09.470
and that even if you could
sail out here into the ocean,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.143
you would run out of
supplies and die long before

00:03:13.143 --> 00:03:16.251
you ever hit land 'cause they had no idea

00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:18.439
that the Americas were over here.

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.315
Columbus however had done
some different calculations

00:03:21.315 --> 00:03:23.437
and he thought that the
circumference of the world

00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.270
was only about 16 to 18,000 miles.

00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:34.441
So that the coast of Japan
was about 3,000 miles

00:03:36.508 --> 00:03:38.777
to the west of Europe.

00:03:38.777 --> 00:03:41.821
Now he was wrong, but he
got very lucky because

00:03:41.821 --> 00:03:45.526
about 3,000 miles to the west of Europe

00:03:45.526 --> 00:03:48.221
he encountered landfall.

00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:51.284
He just didn't know that what
he found there wasn't China.

00:03:51.284 --> 00:03:54.088
So Columbus has this dream
and he kind of shops it around

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:57.191
the courts of Europe
looking for royal patronage.

00:03:57.191 --> 00:04:01.146
And first he tries the
Portuguese because they are

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:03.576
the reigning leaders of navigation.

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:06.995
And they turn him down
saying his idea is too risky.

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:09.940
He also tries France and
England with similar results.

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.298
Finally he tries Spain.

00:04:12.298 --> 00:04:15.673
And Ferdinand and Isabella
agree that they will stake him.

00:04:15.673 --> 00:04:19.590
They give him three ships
and a crew of 87 men.

00:04:20.783 --> 00:04:23.700
And in August of 1492 he takes off,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.217
makes a brief stop in the Canary Islands,

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.373
and then turns west into open waters.

00:04:33.373 --> 00:04:37.046
And in October of 1492 he made landfall,

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:38.455
and this is what he found.

00:04:38.455 --> 00:04:42.211
So he landed on the small island
that he named San Salvador

00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:44.711
which is today in the Bahamas.

00:04:46.394 --> 00:04:50.359
And then he continued to
explore around the coast of Cuba

00:04:50.359 --> 00:04:52.009
that he called Juana.

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:56.224
And then he ended up in the
island that he called Hispianola

00:04:56.224 --> 00:04:59.057
which is today the island of Haiti

00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:02.201
and the Dominican Republic.

00:05:03.472 --> 00:05:06.778
And we'll talk more about
who he met in the new world

00:05:06.778 --> 00:05:07.869
in the next video.
