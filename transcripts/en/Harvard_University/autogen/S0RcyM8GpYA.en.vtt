be about that the experience of not
 

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.610
be about that the experience of not
knowing of moving inside the poem to

00:25:16.610 --> 00:25:16.620
knowing of moving inside the poem to
 

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:19.400
knowing of moving inside the poem to
find out what it will be of letting the

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:19.410
find out what it will be of letting the
 

00:25:19.410 --> 00:25:22.970
find out what it will be of letting the
book be formed by the unknowing creation

00:25:22.970 --> 00:25:22.980
