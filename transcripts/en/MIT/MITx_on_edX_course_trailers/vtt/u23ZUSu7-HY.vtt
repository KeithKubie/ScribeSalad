00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.142
-You see what low grades you made
on your weekly mathematics test.

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:05.350
More than half of you failed.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.090

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:14.100
SANJOY MAHAJAN: Does math seem dry,
abstract, or remote from the world?

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.060
A hoops to jump through in school, a
subject only a mother or a computer

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.100
could love?

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.110
It's not.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.410
Doing math is like street fighting.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.240
Solving problems is a duel with nature.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.000
In a street fight, nobody cares
whether your form is exact.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.330
What matters is that you connect.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:34.735
Because then you really get it.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:43.080

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.700
I'm Sanjoy Mahajan.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.640
I'm associate professor of
applied science and engineering

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.810
at Olin College and visiting
associate professor at MIT.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.630
I learned proper mathematics at
Oxford and improper mathematics

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.775
at Cal Tech as a physics PhD student.

00:00:59.775 --> 00:01:03.822
And now I promise to share
with you the best of both.

00:01:03.822 --> 00:01:06.500
I'll teach you how to shoot
first and ask questions later.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.650

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.070
This philosophy is a theme of
6.SFMx, Street Fighting Math.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.710
In this course, my
co-instructor Ike Chuang and I

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.300
will show you the ways and
the courage to guess answers

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.940
without a proof or an exact calculation.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.960
You will learn to make seemingly
magical mental calculations,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.460
to debunk a common
economics misconception,

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.010
to solve differential equations
without using calculus,

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.766
and to estimate the fuel consumption of
airplanes by dropping coffee filters.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.730
Together we'll develop
six reasoning tools

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.300
to span mathematics and its
application to the world.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.880
Whether you're a student, a
practicing scientists or engineer,

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.715
or are simply curious, welcome.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.050
You'll learn a new way to
attack quantitative problems

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:10.199
and find that, like a party, math
done right is messy, funny, and fun.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.310
Take this course and
you'll be dangerous.
