BORIS MASIS: Hi.

00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.870
I'm outside a cafe
at the Google office

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.410
in Mountain View, California.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.350
And we're about to see
how guerrilla usability

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.320
testing with as
few as five users

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.390
can help you find up to
85% of the core usability

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.631
problems in your app.

00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.880
Come on, let's go take a look.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.814
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.780
Thank you for stopping by.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.090
I'm working with a client
on a mobile application.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.070
And in a minute, I'll
show you the application

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.980
and I'll ask you some
questions about it.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.274
It'll take about 10 minutes.

00:00:39.274 --> 00:00:40.690
As you go through
the application,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.620
I want you to think
aloud to voice

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.452
whatever you're thinking or
feeling as you look through it.

00:00:45.452 --> 00:00:46.160
Please be honest.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.070
This is a test of the
application not of you.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.240
Time out!

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.114
Guerrilla usability
testing is a lot of fun

00:00:53.114 --> 00:00:54.780
and it's one of the
most effective tools

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.740
you have to improve the quality
of your app or a website.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.160
In fact, it doesn't matter
if it's an app, a website,

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.830
a remote control, or a door.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.490
Usability simply
means that people

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:05.790
can use the thing for
its intended purpose.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.520
And here's one
fun and simple way

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.620
to conduct guerrilla
usability testing.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.510
Go to a fairly popular cafe.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.420
Ask people to test
your app for 10 minutes

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.630
and then give them a
small treat as a thanks.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.430
It's a great way
to spend an hour.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.550
OK, time in.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.270
The great news is that you
only need to talk to five users

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.790
to find 85% of the core
usability problems.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.450
The most important
usability problems

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.627
are easy to spot for people
who are new to your application

00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:33.960
and difficult for you to spot
because you no longer have

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.046
fresh eyes.

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:36.670
You're too close to
the product to know

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.550
how real people perceive
it for the first time.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.410
Jakob Nielsen is a
usability testing pioneer

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.480
who led extensive research to
arrive at the magic five users

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.426
number.

00:01:46.426 --> 00:01:47.800
It turns out that
you learn a lot

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.740
from the first person
you talk to you,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.120
a little less from the
next, and so forth.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.240
After the fifth user,
you're wasting your time

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.040
by observing the same findings
repeatedly but not learning

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.530
much new.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.070
You can use our
ready-made template

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.630
to customize your survey and
print out a sign for the cafe.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.590
Next, decide who will go.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.480
One or two people is
the perfect number.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.354
You don't want to have
more than three people

00:02:09.354 --> 00:02:11.625
because it may make your
tester feel uncomfortable.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.000
Everyone involved
in your product

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.280
should go at some point.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.740
This includes your designer,
developer, product manager,

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.262
executive, customer
service people, et cetera.

00:02:19.262 --> 00:02:20.720
You'll want to
choose a nice reward

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.390
to give your testers like
a gift card to the cafe

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.790
or buy them a drink or desert.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.130
People who are alone
are easy to ask.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.010
And remember, after five
people, you're done.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.070
The think aloud method
is critical for getting

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.640
inside the user's head.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.215
It means asking the user to
speak out loud everything they

00:02:37.215 --> 00:02:38.200
are thinking.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.740
For example, they should
be saying things like hmm,

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.000
this looks like a news app.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.570
I wonder how I can get it
to show me the sports news.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.100
Maybe if I tap
here, that's where

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.410
I think it might let
me select the category.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.500
Oh that loaded pretty
slowly, et cetera.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.940
Be sure to take good
notes of what people say.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.050
Some clear patterns will emerge
from the feedback you get.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.414
Back home, you can fix
these usability problems.

00:02:59.414 --> 00:03:01.330
And what's critical is
that you then come back

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.210
to the cafe to validate
that users no longer face

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.471
these issues.

00:03:05.471 --> 00:03:06.970
All right, well, I
think we're done.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.540
So now that we're finished, do
you have any questions for me?

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.410
MALE SPEAKER: No, I
thought it was interesting.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.750
I hope the feedback is helpful.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.570
BORIS MASIS: Thank you so much.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.070
And now it's your turn.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.700
You now have a new
tool in your belt

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.682
to make your app
even more awesome.

00:03:19.682 --> 00:03:21.390
Go on and try this
out in the real world.

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.970
You can customize our
template and questionnaire

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.120
to suit your app.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.960
I'm Boris Masis with the Google
Developer Relations team.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.827
Thanks for watching.
