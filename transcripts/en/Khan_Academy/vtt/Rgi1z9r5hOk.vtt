00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.030
- [Instructor] We are told
Ismael made a scaled copy

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.920
of the following quadrilateral.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.920
He used a scale factor
less than one, all right.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.160
And then they say what could be the length

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.880
of the side that corresponds to AD?

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.290
So AD is right over here.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.240
AD has length 16 units in
our original quadrilateral.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.700
What could be the length of the side

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.270
that corresponds with
AD on the scaled copy

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.090
of the quadrilateral?

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.000
So it's a scale factor less than one.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.870
So we're gonna get something
that is less than 16

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.090
for that side.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.180
And the rest of it will all
be scaled by the same factor.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
So the resulting quadrilateral
might look something,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.220
might look something like this.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.450
This is just my hand-drawn version.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.900
So the key realization is

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.290
is if our scale factor is less than one,

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.100
this thing right over here is going to be

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.000
less than 16 units.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.310
So let's look at the choices.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.343
And it says choose three answers.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.500
So pause the video.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.900
Which of these would match

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.370
if we're scaling by a
factor of less than one?

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.420
Well, we just have to see which of these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.000
are less than 16 units.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.620
This is less than 16.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.070
This is less than 16.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.330
This is less than 16.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.040
And those are the only
three that are less than 16.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.580
32 units, this would be
a scale factor of two.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.940
64 units, this would be
a scale factor of four,

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.603
clearly a scale factor
that is not less than one.
