hello and welcome to the third lesson in
 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.299
hello and welcome to the third lesson in
native language storica linguistics and

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309
native language storica linguistics and
 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.790
native language storica linguistics and
language change this time around using

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800
language change this time around using
 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.319
language change this time around using
the concepts that you learned in the

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:20.329
the concepts that you learned in the
 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.019
the concepts that you learned in the
last lesson namely cognates which are

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029
last lesson namely cognates which are
 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.409
last lesson namely cognates which are
inherited words borrowings and chants I

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419
inherited words borrowings and chants I
 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.389
inherited words borrowings and chants I
want you to take a look for a minute at

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:28.399
want you to take a look for a minute at
 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.609
want you to take a look for a minute at
some basic core words from four

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619
some basic core words from four
 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.720
some basic core words from four
languages these languages are Italian

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730
languages these languages are Italian
 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.840
languages these languages are Italian
galician-portuguese and Maori these

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850
galician-portuguese and Maori these
 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.850
galician-portuguese and Maori these
words are actually fairly representative

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:39.860
words are actually fairly representative
 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.740
words are actually fairly representative
of the relationships between these

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750
of the relationships between these
 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.290
of the relationships between these
languages take a moment to consider

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300
languages take a moment to consider
 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.870
languages take a moment to consider
which languages share a common ancestry

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:46.880
which languages share a common ancestry
 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.660
which languages share a common ancestry
and how closely these languages must be

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670
and how closely these languages must be
 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:01:07.830
and how closely these languages must be
related

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840
 
 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.929
 
we have good grounds for considering

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939
we have good grounds for considering
 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:11.760
we have good grounds for considering
that Portuguese and Galician are very

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770
that Portuguese and Galician are very
 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.270
that Portuguese and Galician are very
closely related we also have grounds for

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
closely related we also have grounds for
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.160
closely related we also have grounds for
saying that Italian Portuguese and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170
saying that Italian Portuguese and
 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.100
saying that Italian Portuguese and
Galician are less closely related but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110
Galician are less closely related but
 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.830
Galician are less closely related but
they're all related to each other as

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
they're all related to each other as
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.300
they're all related to each other as
long as we group Galician and Portuguese

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310
long as we group Galician and Portuguese
 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.130
long as we group Galician and Portuguese
more closely together in this

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140
more closely together in this
 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.109
more closely together in this
relationship we can say that Italian

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119
relationship we can say that Italian
 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.850
relationship we can say that Italian
Galician and Portuguese are all related

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860
Galician and Portuguese are all related
 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.520
Galician and Portuguese are all related
to each other Maori on the other hand

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530
to each other Maori on the other hand
 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.069
to each other Maori on the other hand
doesn't seem to be related at all so at

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079
doesn't seem to be related at all so at
 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:36.749
doesn't seem to be related at all so at
this point we'll set it to the side and

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759
this point we'll set it to the side and
 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.419
this point we'll set it to the side and
say that it's an unrelated language that

00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:39.429
say that it's an unrelated language that
 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:41.340
say that it's an unrelated language that
is it may rebe related to other

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350
is it may rebe related to other
 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.529
is it may rebe related to other
languages but it is not related to

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:43.539
languages but it is not related to
 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.410
languages but it is not related to
Italian Galician and Portuguese at least

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420
Italian Galician and Portuguese at least
 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210
Italian Galician and Portuguese at least
as far as we can tell from this set of

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220
as far as we can tell from this set of
 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.570
as far as we can tell from this set of
words but that's not enough at this

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580
words but that's not enough at this
 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.880
words but that's not enough at this
point we just have a flat understanding

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890
point we just have a flat understanding
 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.370
point we just have a flat understanding
of the relationships we should extend

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380
of the relationships we should extend
 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.770
of the relationships we should extend
this back the same way we do with family

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780
this back the same way we do with family
 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.830
this back the same way we do with family
tree now what we'll do is we'll group

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840
tree now what we'll do is we'll group
 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.320
tree now what we'll do is we'll group
Galician and Portuguese together in one

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330
Galician and Portuguese together in one
 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.929
Galician and Portuguese together in one
branch of the tree and then an Italian

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939
branch of the tree and then an Italian
 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.440
branch of the tree and then an Italian
in a separate branch of the tree so now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450
in a separate branch of the tree so now
 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.449
in a separate branch of the tree so now
we've extended this relationship back

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459
we've extended this relationship back
 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.120
we've extended this relationship back
over time the branches that extend

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130
over time the branches that extend
 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.910
over time the branches that extend
upwards on this diagram show you that in

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920
upwards on this diagram show you that in
 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.490
upwards on this diagram show you that in
the past these languages were actually

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
the past these languages were actually
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.370
the past these languages were actually
more closely related to each other in

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380
more closely related to each other in
 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.559
more closely related to each other in
other words they diverged from common

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:25.569
other words they diverged from common
 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.770
other words they diverged from common
ancestors in the case of Galician and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780
ancestors in the case of Galician and
 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.140
ancestors in the case of Galician and
Portuguese they actually diverged from a

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150
Portuguese they actually diverged from a
 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.229
Portuguese they actually diverged from a
nearer common ancestor right you see

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239
nearer common ancestor right you see
 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.780
nearer common ancestor right you see
that note this note here is the common

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
that note this note here is the common
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.199
that note this note here is the common
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese
 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.090
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese
now this note here is also related to

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100
now this note here is also related to
 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.330
now this note here is also related to
Italian there's an even further note

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340
Italian there's an even further note
 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.090
Italian there's an even further note
meaning further back in time that is the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100
meaning further back in time that is the
 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.550
meaning further back in time that is the
common ancestor of Italian Galician and

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560
common ancestor of Italian Galician and
 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.430
common ancestor of Italian Galician and
Portuguese now we have two question

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440
Portuguese now we have two question
 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.770
Portuguese now we have two question
marks here what do these question marks

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780
marks here what do these question marks
 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.500
marks here what do these question marks
mean they're just nodes on our diagram

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510
mean they're just nodes on our diagram
 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330
mean they're just nodes on our diagram
but they represent more than that

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340
but they represent more than that
 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.360
but they represent more than that
there's actually some language spoken in

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370
there's actually some language spoken in
 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.370
there's actually some language spoken in
the past that must be the common

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380
the past that must be the common
 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.309
the past that must be the common
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese
 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.449
ancestor of both Galician and Portuguese
otherwise they wouldn't be around they

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459
otherwise they wouldn't be around they
 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.599
otherwise they wouldn't be around they
wouldn't share these common cognates so

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609
wouldn't share these common cognates so
 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.520
wouldn't share these common cognates so
these common cognates derived from words

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530
these common cognates derived from words
 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.920
these common cognates derived from words
in a single language this single

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930
in a single language this single
 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.619
in a single language this single
ancestor language now there's an even

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:19.629
ancestor language now there's an even
 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:21.309
ancestor language now there's an even
more remote common ends

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319
more remote common ends
 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:23.500
more remote common ends
sir from galician-portuguese in Italian

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510
sir from galician-portuguese in Italian
 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.759
sir from galician-portuguese in Italian
and that's a form of vulgar latin in at

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769
and that's a form of vulgar latin in at
 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.429
and that's a form of vulgar latin in at
least some small way these two languages

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:30.439
least some small way these two languages
 

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:33.280
least some small way these two languages
galician-portuguese and vulgar latin are

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290
galician-portuguese and vulgar latin are
 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.459
galician-portuguese and vulgar latin are
attested that means we have documents we

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:36.469
attested that means we have documents we
 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:38.890
attested that means we have documents we
can look back at we can look today at

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900
can look back at we can look today at
 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.990
can look back at we can look today at
documents that were written in those

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000
documents that were written in those
 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.229
documents that were written in those
languages we have some attestation of

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239
languages we have some attestation of
 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.360
languages we have some attestation of
their existence we know what they look

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370
their existence we know what they look
 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.670
their existence we know what they look
like we can see their vocabulary items

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680
like we can see their vocabulary items
 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.739
like we can see their vocabulary items
in written words and based on other

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:50.749
in written words and based on other
 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.229
in written words and based on other
evidence we actually have some knowledge

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239
evidence we actually have some knowledge
 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.050
evidence we actually have some knowledge
of how those words were pronounced these

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060
of how those words were pronounced these
 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.750
of how those words were pronounced these
were real languages that are documented

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760
were real languages that are documented
 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.059
were real languages that are documented
what happens when we don't have that

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069
what happens when we don't have that
 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:03.789
what happens when we don't have that
kind of attestation we'll have to get a

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799
kind of attestation we'll have to get a
 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:05.709
kind of attestation we'll have to get a
little bit more innovative we'll have to

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:05.719
little bit more innovative we'll have to
 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.740
little bit more innovative we'll have to
use something known as reconstruction to

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750
use something known as reconstruction to
 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.899
use something known as reconstruction to
posit a hypothetical ancestor language

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:10.909
posit a hypothetical ancestor language
 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:13.089
posit a hypothetical ancestor language
that's the parent of the modern

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099
that's the parent of the modern
 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.449
that's the parent of the modern
languages in our next lesson we'll look

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:16.459
languages in our next lesson we'll look
 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:18.819
languages in our next lesson we'll look
at how exactly we do that and we'll go

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829
at how exactly we do that and we'll go
 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.310
at how exactly we do that and we'll go
about doing two basic reconstructions to
