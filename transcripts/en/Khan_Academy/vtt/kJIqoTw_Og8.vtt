00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:04.010
Charles and Tammy live the
same distance from work,

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:07.860
and they started walking
to work at the same time.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.510
They both walked
at constant speeds,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.340
though not necessarily
at the same speed.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.190
Charles' distance from work is
shown in the following table.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:22.750
So at 50 seconds, he's
830 meters from work.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.590
Then another 50 seconds
goes by, and now he's

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.110
760 meters from work.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:28.880
Another 50 seconds
goes by, and he's

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.460
690 meters from work,
which makes sense.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.190
He's getting closer and closer
to work as seconds pass by.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.080
He's walking to work.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.910
Which of these sentences
could possibly be true?

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.790
Select all that apply.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.790
So what are these
sentences talking about?

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.831
So it looks like they're
all talking about Tammy.

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:46.370
Tammy started 830
meters from work

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.800
and walked towards work
at 2 meters per second.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.590
She started 900 meters from
work and walked towards work

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.579
at 7/5 meters per second.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.120
So all of these seem
to be statements

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.580
about where did Tammy start
and how quickly did she

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.700
walk to work?

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.180
So let's think about which of
these could possibly be true.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.290
Well, the one thing
that we know is

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.300
that they live the same
distance from work.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.010
So the distance
that Charles started

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.010
walking from work, that's
the same distance that Tammy

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.440
started walking from work.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.780
So let's figure out
what that distance is.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.250
So we see that every
50 seconds, so if we

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.810
go from 50 to 100 seconds, so
if we add 50 seconds, or 50

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.030
seconds go by, it
looks like Charles

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.230
traveled another-- let's see.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:38.130
To go from 830 to 760,
his distance from work

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.985
decreased by 70 meters.

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:45.610
And let's see if that
keeps holding up.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.920
It should because they're
moving at constant speeds.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.230
Another 50 seconds goes by,
and his distance from work

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.150
decreases by another 70 meters.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.640
So what would have happened
50 seconds in the past?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.660
So what would
happen at 0 seconds?

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.130
So 50 seconds before
he's at 830 meters,

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.550
he would have been 70
meters further from work.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.410
So he would have been
900 meters from work,

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.050
and we see that it's consistent.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.560
When 50 seconds pass by,
when we go from 0 seconds

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.230
to 50 seconds, he goes from 900
meters away to 70 meters away.

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.030
So once again, his distance
from work decreases by 70.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.850
Then another 50 seconds goes
by, it decreases by 70 again.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.870
Another 50 seconds, it
decreases by 70 again.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.920
So at time 0, Charles was
900 meters away from work.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.080
Now, we know that Tammy and
Charles live the same distance

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.720
away from work.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.490
So Tammy would have also started
900 meters away from work.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.930
Now, they tell us that
they don't necessarily

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.060
walk at the same speed.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.240
So we don't know what
Tammy's speed is.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.730
This hasn't in any way
constrained Tammy's speed.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.510
So we know that she
started 900 meters away.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.130
So we know that this
can't be the case.

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.340
That says 830.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.840
We know that this
can't be the case.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.006
We know that this can't be
the case because they all

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.900
talk about starting at a
distance other than 900 meters.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.400
And over here,
both of these, they

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.510
say she started at
900 meters from work

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.060
and walked towards work
at 7/5 meters per second.

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.310
Well, that's possible.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.890
It's not necessarily true.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.120
They just haven't given us
information on her speed.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.500
But given the
information so far,

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.880
this is definitely
a possibility.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.360
Likewise, Tammy
started 900 meters

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.850
from work-- we
know that is true--

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.000
and walked towards work
at 5/7 meters per second.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.070
Well, once again,
that's a possibility.

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.120
That hasn't been ruled
out by the information

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.160
right over here.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:45.197
So these two are
both possibly true.
