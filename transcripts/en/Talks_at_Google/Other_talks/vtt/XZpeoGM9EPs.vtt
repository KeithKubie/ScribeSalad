00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.830
&gt;&gt;Male Presenter: We're delighted to have
Dr. David Agus joining us today.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.230
He's a professor of medicine and engineering
at USC, and heads up the Westside Cancer Center

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.960
and the Center for Applied Molecular Medicine
there at USC.

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
He clearly excels in business as much as he
does in academics.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.590
He's the cofounder of two personalized medicine
companies.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.160
One is Navigenics and the other is Applied
Proteomics.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.390
His recently published book, The End of Illness,
calls for a shift in the fundamental ways

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.161
in which we think about the actions of health
and illness, including a view of the body

00:00:37.161 --> 00:00:42.230
as a complex system rather than a series of
simple causal chains.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.159
He balances this philosophical approach with
a very practical one, laying out recommended

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:52.390
annual health checkpoints, lab results that
you should have done regularly, and why you

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.820
should not sit down all day at your job.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.829
His book is really, for me, was all about
prevention and how to keep yourself healthy,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.080
which is an area that both Google and Googlers
need to own as we grow older.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:15.460
If all of that somehow left you in doubt about
his brilliance, Dr. Agus also has achieved

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.119
a degree of celebrity stardom.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:22.930
He was on the Daily Show a few weeks ago with
Jon Stewart.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.909
I guess what we're really all wondering is
what Jon Stewart says to his guests as he

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.149
leans over the desk as the camera pans out.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:34.430
With that, I welcome Dr. David Agus.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.430
[applause]

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030
&gt;&gt;David Agus: Thank you.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.000
It's funny, Jon Stewart-- Before the show,
I went up to him and I said, "I'm scared to

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
death.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I'm a cancer doc.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.799
I do all this media, but being live with a
comic scares me a little."

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.030
And he said, "Listen, I'll give you a hint.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.460
Most people at the end of the show stand up
and leave, but there's 30 seconds when the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.750
credits roll.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.110
You lean forward and talk to me.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.539
People will think we're friends, and it will
work."

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.210
[laughter] Then I lean forward at the end
and he goes, "The deal was for me to have

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.929
told you this, is now you have to be my doctor."

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.490
[laughter]
It's a pleasure to be here.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.630
Thank you.

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.170
The End of Illness is a declaratory, aggressive
title.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.830
I submitted it to the publisher about 8, 9
months ago.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.910
It was called, at the time, What Is Health?,
as an homage to SchrÃ¶dinger's What Is Life?

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:20.910
book from the 1940s.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.260
I had a call from the publisher saying, "Agus,
Steve Jobs just called and changed the title

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.260
of your book."

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.710
I'm like, "He did?"

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.560
And they're like, "He changed it to The End
of Illness."

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.269
I called Steve, and I said, "Steve, I love
the title, but why didn't you tell me or discuss

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.269
it with me?"

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.670
He goes, "Agus, it's not your job.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.670
It's theirs."

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.790
I was like, "Okay."

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.550
I thought about it, and it is obviously and
aggressive title.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.150
But it's something I believe in.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.220
I truly believe we can delay illness to the
ninth or tenth decade.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.549
If you look in the United States, 1956 was
the last year you can die of old age on a

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:53.970
death certificate.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.400
Since then, we've had to have a cause, whether
it be diabetes or lung cancer or prostate

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400
cancer.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400
You name it, there had to be a cause.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.860
But I want to go back to the era of dying
of old age.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.470
The paradox is in that if we delay illness
to the ninth or tenth decade, healthcare costs

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.319
will come down dramatically.

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:19.239
If you get ill in your 80s and 90s or 100s,
actually, you don't go to an intensive care

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:20.239
unit.

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:21.239
You don't go on a ventilator.

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.269
We treat you with dignity instead of trying
to prolong things.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.720
Remember, over 60% of healthcare costs in
the United States right now are the last two

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.280
years of life.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.240
We spend almost nothing from age 15 to age
55.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.900
Obviously, part of the premise that I want
to push to you is we've got to shift that

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.700
because we have to prevent illness.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.890
We are the number 1 spender in the world on
healthcare, and we're ranked 32nd.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.610
Washington has ex bandwidth for health, and
most of it, if not all of it, is spent on

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.650
healthcare finance.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:53.140
None of it's spent on health.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.849
What I'm going to present you today is a new
way of looking at health and really focusing

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:00.159
on what I think we need to do as changes.

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.969
The book came out 3, 4 weeks ago.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:07.730
What's amazing is I've already had about 6,
now, video conferences with member of the

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:08.730
Chinese government.

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.560
They're going to enact parts of the book as
law this summer.

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.490
Whereas the US government, it will take a
decade of debate before they even bring it

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.209
up to talk about it publicly.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.660
The first question when I talk about this
book is everyone says, "You're a cancer doctor.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.830
Why do you have the right to publish this
book and talk about it?"

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:30.889
To me, it comes from the old adage that in
order to understand peace, you have to go

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:32.320
to war.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.860
Fighting cancer for the last 25 years has
brought, in my mind, a whole new way of approaching

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.860
health.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.760
The team that I work with are two other individuals
who bring very unique ways of looking at health.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.419
I've got Murray Gell-Mann.

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.680
Murray is probably the greatest living physicist.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.030
Discovered the quark, string theory.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.620
He won the Nobel Prize in 1969.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.820
Now, he's working on modeling health with
our team.

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.040
And a guy named Danny Hillis, who built the
first supercomputer and discovered RAID storage

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:04.590
in the old days, and is again one of the great
engineers who is now working on modeling health

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.590
now.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.810
What you'll see is the result of us thinking
about health or approaching it as a biologist,

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.389
a physicist, and an engineer.

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.610
I'll show you a new model, looking at health
as a complex emergent system as disease in

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.470
the body, how one can apply it, so it will
be prescriptive, and then how technology is

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.860
going to be, in my mind, what allows us and
brings us the hope to actually bring us change.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.949
The first question is: what is health?

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:29.949
Is it your cholesterol?

00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.949
Is it your weight?

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:31.949
Is it how you feel?

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:32.949
Is it how you sleep?

00:05:32.949 --> 00:05:33.949
Is it how you look?

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.440
How do you define health?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.699
Any engineer will tell you it's impossible
to optimize a system unless you develop parameters

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.270
on which to optimize.

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:42.270
So what is it?

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.509
Is it how long you live?

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.289
Is it what you look like?

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:48.009
On what parameter are we going to optimize
health?

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:49.870
We don't have a blood test for health.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.420
If I asked you today, "Are you healthy?",
how do you respond?

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.729
That's one of the fundamental problems is
I don't know how to define health when I look

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.270
at it.

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.550
We can talk about all the corporate wellness
programs in the world, but corporate wellness

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.199
programs will optimize on lowering health
insurance costs.

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.490
Corporate illness programs are about delaying
illness till retirement.

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:15.479
But I want to figure out a way to optimize
health.

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.139
We'll talk about ways I think we could start
to do that, going forward.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.479
Mark Twain, in his imminent wisdom, said,
"The only way to keep your health is to eat

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:26.610
what you don't want, drink what you don't
like, and do what you'd rather not."

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.819
[laughter] When I asked Steve, "Why didn't
you like the title What Is Health?"

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:35.240
He said, "If you put the word health in the
title, people think of chewing cardboard."

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.400
That's part of the problem, is that health
is something that we know we're not going

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.639
to like if you say what you have to do.

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:46.600
Things that are unhealthy are more appealing.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.490
What I'll try to show you today is that that's
not really the case.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.370
By definition, things in health don't have
to be unappealing.

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:57.169
Again, we go to what is that metric for health.

00:06:57.169 --> 00:07:01.470
Well, in the United States, we spent over
a billion dollars last year in people over

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.129
the age of 50 getting growth hormone.

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:04.129
Why?

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.199
If I give you growth hormone at age 50, 60,
or 70, you're going to look better in a couple

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:09.199
of months.

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.289
You're going to be all buff.

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.150
Your friends are going to come and be all,
"Hey, what happened to you?

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:13.150
Did you get a haircut?

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.150
You look great."

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:15.310
You're going to feel better.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:19.360
You're going to live, on average, 12 or 13
years less.

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.360
But you're going to look better.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.200
And yet, our country, we do this all the time.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:27.479
People go in, especially in my city, Los Angeles,
and they get shots of growth hormone to look

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:28.479
better.

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:32.730
They take, whether it be steroids, they get
Botox, they get all kinds of things to look

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:33.730
better.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:37.169
But again, I want people to think about tomorrow
as well as today.

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:41.450
There's an amazing group of people in Ecuador
that was identified in a paper in Science

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.259
this last year, where they actually looked.

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.440
They have a mutation of the growth hormone
receptor.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:51.330
These people don't get cancer and don't get
diabetes at all in their populations.

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:57.659
They have other problems, but what we also
know is that species that grow larger or members

00:07:57.659 --> 00:08:00.550
of a species that grow larger have more health
problems.

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:04.300
And yet, we as a society push to making people
larger.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:05.890
One of the chapters of the book is about football
players.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:11.409
Football players are, in general, very large,
have a lot of inflammation, as we'll talk

00:08:11.409 --> 00:08:12.409
about.

00:08:12.409 --> 00:08:15.160
CNN did a story on this for the Super Bowl.

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.240
I can't tell you how many hate emails I got,
and letters.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.139
"You're taking away American culture."

00:08:20.139 --> 00:08:21.360
"You're screwing us."

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.210
I'm not against football, but I'm against
the concept of inflammation.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.880
I'm against the concept of the bigger, the
better, as we'll talk about.

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.860
We need to start to identify what are the
metrics each of us individually are going

00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:35.840
to look at, because obviously, we want to
live until our 90s.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.130
The key is avoid disease.

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.710
I look at 2 to 3 people a week, and I say,
"I've got no more drugs to treat your cancer.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:41.710
I've run out.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:43.500
And unfortunately, the cancer's going to win."

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:45.320
I don't want to do that anymore.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.940
The way to stop that is to avoid disease.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.790
Most diseases can be delayed or avoided.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:56.420
I don't know if you guys saw the paper last
week, but now we'll make Alzheimer's a disease

00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:59.130
of the past over the next 5 to 7 years.

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:03.350
It's astonishing, but Alzheimer's will go
away.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:08.210
If you look at it, a month ago, 15% of us
in the room will be affected by Alzheimer's.

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:10.090
As of the data last week, it's staggering.

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:11.260
There are two big advances.

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.751
The first is they took a couple of cells that
made this abnormal protein called tau, which

00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:18.760
is what messes up the brain in Alzheimer's.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.700
They put them in the brain of a mouse.

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.190
Then they sacrificed the mouse a couple weeks
later.

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.010
And what do you know: those tangles are all
over the brain.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:30.350
So Alzheimer's isn't a disease of the brain,
it's a disease of a couple cells that then

00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:33.020
spreads its proteins throughout the brain.

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.360
If you block that, you no longer will have
Alzheimer's.

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:39.560
We have a mouse model now that's accurate.

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.591
We can develop it.

00:09:40.591 --> 00:09:43.660
Instead of testing in humans-- The problems
in testing in patients is you've got to do

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.660
it for ten years.

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:49.190
You're not going to know until-- ahh!-- ten
years later whether it worked or not.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.410
So now we've got a model.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:55.090
And then, get a load of this, they took a
drug for lymphoma that had been FDA approved

00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:58.260
already, it's on the market, and they gave
it to these mice.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.010
Well, if a mouse-- You drop a napkin in a
cage, they chew it up and make a little nest.

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.410
It's called nesting.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:09.040
You give a mouse Alzheimer's, they just sit
in a corner and act like this and do nothing.

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:13.000
You give them this drug for lymphoma with
the Alzheimer's, two days later, they're making

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.470
a nest again.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:18.640
You look in the brain of the animal, 60% of
these tangles are gone.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.970
Again, this is a drug that's already FDA approved
and on the market.

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.740
So we're going to have a marked impact on
Alzheimer's and every disease we'll talk about

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:27.740
today.

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.750
The key is delaying them or preventing them
so you, I, our loved ones, can benefit from

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:35.760
those advances.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:40.200
And again, we talked about that it's actually
going to lower costs if we do this right.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.320
In the 1930s, J.B.S.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:45.960
Haldane, who was the great thinker of the
time, said this amazing quote, because it

00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.080
really is true today.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.080
He was right.

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.890
He predicted it 90 years ago.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:54.860
He said, "Bacteria and this germ theory is
going to screw up everything because we're

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:56.740
going to forget about the system.â

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:01.450
We're going to treat other diseases like cancer,
heart disease, and Alzheimer's like infectious

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.440
disease, and we're going to be wrong.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.620
He was right.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:08.690
Remember, infectious disease, you make the
diagnosis, you know the treatment.

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:09.710
It's easy.

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:12.770
That bacteria, that antibiotic, they work.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:16.610
It doesn't care if you're short, round, tall,
fat, green, yellow, blue.

00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:20.400
It will work because bacteria come from without.

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.450
The problem is, human disease comes from within.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:27.500
Human disease, you make a diagnosis, most
of the time you don't know the treatment because

00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:32.420
it's the interaction of that disease in your
body that's unique in each of us.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.230
Very different from infectious disease.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:39.050
Yet, over the last 90 years, we've been treating
almost all disease like infectious disease.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:41.140
You have X, let me give you Y.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:45.020
Most of the time, unfortunately, that doesn't
work.

00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:49.701
This is one of the sad figures that's in the
book that I get a lot of comments about, which

00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:55.160
is heart disease, stroke, down dramatically
in death rate over the last 50 years.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.060
Cancer, not really a change.

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.620
Well, what caused this major decline?

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:00.980
Two things.

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.270
Smoking: we're smoking less.

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:09.390
And then statins: statins are class of drug
that were developed to lower LDL, the bad

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:12.040
cholesterol, and then they were given to patients.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.210
They had a dramatic effect on heart disease
and stroke.

00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:18.680
Turns out that their mechanism, how they work,
was different than lowering cholesterol, as

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:19.680
I will talk about.

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.760
It's because they're one of the great anti-inflammatory
drugs we have.

00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.760
The root of diseases like heart disease and
cancer inflammation.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.500
In fact, statins will reduce the incidence
of cancer beautifully if one takes them for

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.890
several years.

00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:40.110
So, dramatic effect here, yet influenza, right:
we can give vaccines, we have antibiotics,

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.110
fantastic.

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.690
Cancer, not really a big impact.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:47.290
So cancer, we've treated a reductionist way.

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:51.020
The amazing thing about cancer that people
don't get is-- Again, I was one of the heads

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:54.190
of the Cancer Genome Project, so I'm as guilty
as anybody else.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:57.940
But if you look at breast cancer under a microscope,
a pathologist will look and say, "Hey, it's

00:12:57.940 --> 00:12:58.940
breast cancer."

00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:00.430
They don't care what the genetics are.

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:02.290
The body doesn't care what the genetics are.

00:13:02.290 --> 00:13:04.270
Breast cancer looks like breast cancer.

00:13:04.270 --> 00:13:07.060
Colon cancer looks like colon cancer.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.450
Evolution is selecting out for phenotype,
what it looks like, not the underlying genetics.

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:15.810
There are 150 ways to get to be breast cancer,
yet they all look alike.

00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.000
Yet our treatments, we keep trying to hit
those molecular abnormalities.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.050
We forget the other part.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:25.990
A clinical trial was done about 10 years ago
that people thought was crazy, that now is

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:29.670
the standard of care in the treatment of a
disease, breast cancer.

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:32.130
What we did was it took women after optimal
treatment.

00:13:32.130 --> 00:13:37.770
Half got placebo, and half got a drug that
builds bone, a drug for osteoporosis.

00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.990
Recurrence was reduced by 40% Why?

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:43.790
Breast cancer metastasizes to bone.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.240
If you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:50.190
We just made the body inhospitable to breast
cancer.

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:53.450
And what do you know, it didn't come back
in those women.

00:13:53.450 --> 00:13:56.650
A powerful statement, a powerful way to treat
disease.

00:13:56.650 --> 00:14:01.860
Because to me, diseases like cancer, Alzheimer's,
heart disease, they are verbs, not nouns.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.070
You're cancering.

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.260
You're heart diseasing.

00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:09.420
I want to change you from that disease state
to a health state.

00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:16.940
It's a different way of approaching disease
if you think about it.

00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.270
The way I look at it is at a complex emergent
system, where you've got inputs.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:21.450
Your input is your DNA.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.190
Your input's what you eat.

00:14:23.190 --> 00:14:24.190
It's your environment.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.290
It's your work environment.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.540
It's your friends.

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:27.700
Those are all your inputs.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.160
Your output is how you feel.

00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:34.140
That middle state function has been historically
hidden.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:35.910
We haven't been able to look at it.

00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:39.500
Historically, we give change in input and
we see how it affects the output, with all

00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500
those inputs.

00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:41.860
But we've never been able to look in the middle.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:46.940
Well, on the cover of the book, let me just
borrow this for one sec, we can all of a sudden

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:48.810
see the state function.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:50.620
This is a picture of the human proteome.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:55.480
It's a drop of blood going through a supercomputer,
I mean a superconducting magnet, where we

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:59.760
get a 50 to 60 gigabyte image of all the proteins
in the blood.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.840
That's that state function.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.810
For the first time, we can see.

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.470
We'll talk about that a little more in a minute.

00:15:05.470 --> 00:15:09.690
But all of a sudden, you've got various state
functions that are equivalent classes of history.

00:15:09.690 --> 00:15:12.570
They are patients with heart disease, patients
with cancer.

00:15:12.570 --> 00:15:13.920
We can start to modulate them.

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.490
For the first time now with technology, we
can actually see them.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:24.420
Well, the bad news is it is almost impossible
to understand complex emergent systems.

00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:28.330
The good news is, you can control the systems
you can't understand.

00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:32.760
If I asked my 11 year old boy, "How do you
stop a train?", he just says, "You pull the

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:33.760
brake."

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.520
He doesn't first say, "What's the weight of
the train?

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.520
What's the track made of?

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:37.520
What's the temperature?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.680
What's the air speed?"

00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:39.680
He just says, "Listen.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.770
I've got to figure out a way to control it."

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.560
My field has spent the last 50 years trying
to understand diseases like cancer rather

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.690
than just working on ways to optimize and
control them.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:53.730
The average cancer on diagnosis has how many
mutations?

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.750
130.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:58.870
If I can pick one that I could target with
a drug, do you really think it's going to

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.570
make a major difference?

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:04.400
Remember, my field, cancer, we try to shrink
the disease by 50%.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.990
That's called a win, and that's what we get
FDA approval on.

00:16:06.990 --> 00:16:12.190
Well, 50% isn't even an order of magnitude
when you're talking hundreds of billions of

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.190
cells.

00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:15.910
There's something missing here in what we're
doing.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:18.880
There's something missing in how we're approaching
these.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.840
1997, I was a trainee at Sloan-Kettering.

00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.730
A kid, 25 year old kid, had germ cell tumor
of the brain, the lung, and the liver.

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:28.320
He went to the best hospitals in the country.

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:30.740
They told him, "Listen, chemotherapy is just
going to make you sick.

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.390
Why don't you go home to Texas and spend your
last couple months with your family?"

00:16:34.390 --> 00:16:37.140
Instead, this kid went to Indianapolis.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:41.441
He went there because some goofball doc, and
I say the word goofball affectionately, he

00:16:41.441 --> 00:16:45.410
took two platinum electrodes and put it in
a gel and said, "Do cancerous cells like electricity

00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:46.410
or not?"

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.450
Well, it turns out, they didn't really care
about the electricity.

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.780
But some of the platinum in those rods killed
some of the cells.

00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:55.020
So they gave it-- This is the same thing in
my wedding band.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.490
They give it intravenously to this kid in
Indianapolis.

00:16:57.490 --> 00:17:02.570
A year and a half later, he won his first
of 7 Tours de France.

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:06.720
Why did platinum cure Lance Armstrong?

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.860
I have no freaking idea.

00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:11.550
Yet you can find 50 explanations in the scientific
literature.

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:14.540
"Well, it affects the DNA adducts and here
and here."

00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:17.620
Again, we don't really know how these drugs
work.

00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:22.230
Most chemotherapy, I'll challenge you, I don't
think chemotherapy has any data that it actually

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:23.720
touches the cancer cell.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.360
It works, believe me, but it probably changes
your system so the cancer doesn't want to

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:29.890
grow anymore.

00:17:29.890 --> 00:17:34.000
We don't have data that it actually targets
and hits the dividing cancer cells.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.750
Cancer cells are very similar to normal cells.

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:42.100
So again, when you think of this complex emergent
system, we have to look at different ways

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:46.910
of measuring the system, looking at perturbations,
when we look at disease.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:51.380
Remember, I'm the same field that put out
ads like this.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:55.580
I'm the same field that put out ads like this.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.310
And this.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:58.580
And this.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.330
You can't forget the dentists.

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:08.410
I'm the same field, that 25, 30 years ago
said, "Take margarine, not butter."

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:13.050
We killed millions of people by telling them
to do that.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:18.070
Over and over again, we make these declaratory
statements without any real data.

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.510
We make these observational findings.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:26.470
There's an association of X with Y, and therefore,
we should avoid X.

00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:28.490
One of the things I'll talk to you about in
a minute is vitamins.

00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:32.930
Again, which gets people really upset, because
many people-- Vitamins have been a crutch

00:18:32.930 --> 00:18:35.100
which they're leaning on for the last several
decades.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.150
And I'm taking away that crutch.

00:18:37.150 --> 00:18:38.580
They get really upset.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:42.660
I spoke at the Commonwealth Club last night,
and I had protestors.

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:44.570
I've never had a protestor before.

00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:48.900
It's true, I'm different than most people
in that the protestors were 85 years old.

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.320
It's a very different kind of protestor who
protests with what I have to say.

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:56.980
But you'll look at things like vitamin D,
as we'll talk about.

00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:02.740
Right now, if you're over the age of 50, 60%
of people are taking vitamin D supplementation.

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:07.300
The government in Canada had to outlaw vitamin
D testing because it was 11% of their healthcare

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.890
budget two years ago.

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.670
Why are people testing for vitamin D?

00:19:11.670 --> 00:19:13.230
Because there are associations.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:16.950
People with lower vitamin D have a slightly
higher cancer rate and a slightly heart disease

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:17.950
rate.

00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:21.280
Also, if you smoke, you have lower vitamin
D. If you're obese, you have lower vitamin

00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:24.760
D. Nobody's saying if you give vitamin D,
you're going to stop smoking, but there's

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.470
that association, too.

00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:30.230
We'll talk about some of the data, because
it really has been leading us astray in many

00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:31.900
of the things we do.

00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.400
One of the great examples is exercise.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.660
Our exercise notion in our country is: you
do an hour of exercise at the gym or the DVD

00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:45.060
you put in your machine and watch and do some
yoga for an hour, and then you sit at your

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:46.340
desk the rest of the day.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:50.770
Well, if you start to look at the data, real
studies, and we'll talk about some of them,

00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:52.350
as old as 60 years old.

00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:55.670
The data shows that an hour of exercise a
day is awesome.

00:19:55.670 --> 00:19:59.490
You sit the rest of the day, you negate it
all, and it causes harm.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:03.870
In fact, that harm, if one does a quantitation
on incidence of heart disease, it's worse

00:20:03.870 --> 00:20:06.970
than smoking, if you look at it.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.100
So they key is moving.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.390
The original study done is the coolest study.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.260
It was published in 1953 in the British medical
journal Lancet.

00:20:15.260 --> 00:20:16.260
Nobody paid attention to it.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:19.760
It wasn't referenced for literally 40 or 50
years.

00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.250
They did something with privacy rules, now
nobody can do.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:27.650
This guy, Jeremiah Morris, went and looked
at the 26,000 workers in the British Transit

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:28.650
Authority.

00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:29.730
He just looked at all their data.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.730
He didn't care who they were.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:32.230
He just looked at their data.

00:20:32.230 --> 00:20:35.160
What he said is that there were two classes
of employees.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.500
There were the bus drivers that sat 90% of
the day and drove the buses.

00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.740
Then there were the ticket takers that walked
around and took the tickets on those double

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:42.740
decker buses.

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:47.770
Well, the heart disease deaths were 60% less
in the ticket takers compared to the bus drivers

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:51.900
even though they weighed the same, they ate
the same, they lived in the same neighborhoods.

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:53.390
They had everything the same.

00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:56.700
The difference was one group sat and one group
walked.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.360
Powerful argument.

00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.150
He went further in that paper.

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:02.610
This is one of the coolest graphs in science.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.160
It looks at death rate as associated with
profession.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.850
What it showed is the worst professions were
hairdressers who stood in one place, or the

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.300
typists who sat in one place.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:16.400
The best professions, believe it or not, were
the coal miners and the gardeners, because

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.350
they moved and they walked.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:25.020
Today, Nike is launching a product that's
called Fuel, which is a band which you wear.

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.890
It looks at how much you move during the day.

00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.570
It communicates via Bluetooth.

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:32.710
It creates these communities, because unfortunately
or fortunately, depending how you look at

00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:35.670
it, we all need competition to do the right
thing.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:41.470
It's going to create competition among friends,
among corporations, employees, to start to

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:44.460
move more during the day and quantitate it.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:46.790
Moving equates to better health.

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.850
I wore one of those accelerometers and I realized
I was sitting most of the day.

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.990
I got one of those phones that made me look
like an air traffic controller.

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:57.280
Now, when I'm in my office, I'm walking, talking
on the phone.

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.450
I've reduced by half the amount of time I
sit.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:03.180
Someone comes to meet you during the day,
say, "Let's go for a walk."

00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.530
That's a sign of respect, rather than just
sitting in a conference room and talking.

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:15.990
I know what a difference in corporate culture,
but over time, will make an enormous difference

00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:17.180
on health.

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:20.900
Obviously, I talk a lot on negative stuff,
and what we're doing wrong.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.260
But obviously, we're doing things right.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.860
If you look in the United States between 1900
and 2008, there's a dramatic increase in how

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.210
long we live.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:34.720
True, much of that increase comes from reducing
infant mortality, because these data can be

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.200
somewhat misleading.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:42.640
If infants live past the age of 5, the chances
are they're going to live till they're 60.

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:44.950
That obviously skews the results to the right.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:48.850
Especially worldwide, now, we're starting
to eliminate much of infant mortality.

00:22:48.850 --> 00:22:51.190
But at the same time, we are living longer.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:53.610
So we are doing some things right.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:59.560
The problem, the fundamental problem, is that
evolution selects out for who has good kids.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:02.210
It doesn't select out for who lives until
their 90s.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:03.700
We forget that sometimes.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:08.480
In order to go to your 90s, you've got to
optimize a little, and tweak, because evolution

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.830
didn't take care of us.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:14.960
There are things that can help you during
childbearing years that may hurt you later

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.960
on.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.500
For example, if you skip your flu shot this
year, which I'm sure none of you did.

00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.880
If you skip your flu shot, and you got the
flu, you will all survive.

00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:24.890
I guarantee you.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:29.480
You'd have five, six, seven days of feeling
poor, etcetera, and then you'd go back to

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.370
work and you'd be fine.

00:23:31.370 --> 00:23:36.330
A decade from now, your risk of heart disease
and cancer are 10 and 12% elevated, because

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:41.690
those five to seven days of marked inflammation
will have its manifestation a decade from

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.690
now.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:47.110
Our culture is all about what will affect
us today, not tomorrow.

00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:50.160
We have to think more long term, as I'll show
you.

00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:53.280
US mortality, and this is--.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:57.780
Unfortunately the data is several years lagging,
always.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.920
If you look at it, a quarter of deaths are
heart disease.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:07.350
Men higher than women, so 40% of us will die
of heart disease, about 20% of them women,

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.010
will die of heart disease.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.750
Cancer, stroke, infections.

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:16.320
Most of these things are delayable or preventable
by current technologies.

00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.170
Yet most of the things we'll talk about we
ain't really doing.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:20.809
I'm not sure why.

00:24:20.809 --> 00:24:22.640
One of the technologies in full disclosure.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:27.200
I'm a cofounder of Navigenics, one of the
DNA companies out there.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.780
You guys are an investor.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:31.440
Google was an original investor in Navigenics.

00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.650
I did it because the government had been spending
close to a billion dollars a year looking

00:24:36.650 --> 00:24:39.230
at gene associations with disease.

00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:42.580
And yet, nobody was using the data or benefiting
from it.

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:49.730
So 1974, Monsanto's annual report, they set
150 million dollars to sequence one gene.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.650
Two weeks ago on Nightline, Bill Weir, the
Nightline anchor, came to my office.

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:54.220
This was live on Nightline.

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:56.550
We sequenced his genes.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:59.559
We showed he was higher risk of heart disease.

00:24:59.559 --> 00:25:01.720
Based on that, we did a heart scan, live on
TV.

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.200
He's a 42 year old, fit guy.

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.890
Kids under the age of six.

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:08.020
Traveling all over the world.

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:13.531
He's now in-- Just did a report yesterday
on the Foxconn workers for Apple and all the

00:25:13.531 --> 00:25:14.531
issues.

00:25:14.531 --> 00:25:15.531
He's traveling all over.

00:25:15.531 --> 00:25:19.900
We showed, live on TV, that in his heart artery,
the big artery, the LED going to his heart,

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:20.990
there's a big lesion there.

00:25:20.990 --> 00:25:26.020
He would have had a heart attack in the next
one, two, or five years, but we identified

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.580
this live on TV using the preventive strategies.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.170
It saved his life.

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:34.830
The next day, the American Heart Association,
in their beautiful wisdom, says, "Agus screwed

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:35.950
up.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.380
He wasn't eligible for screening."

00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:40.559
I'm like, "Are you guys serious?

00:25:40.559 --> 00:25:44.320
Either your criteria are wrong, because he
was positive.

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.070
Something is missing in this picture here."

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:47.990
So then they said, "Well, you're right.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:50.090
Maybe the criteria can be changed a little.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:52.880
But technology's bad, and screening, and there
are problems with that."

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.810
I got, "Then you guys should be saying, 'Why
aren't we putting more research in technology

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:58.540
to do better screening?'

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:03.200
Just blanket saying, 'He shouldn't have been
screened because too many people will be screened',

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:05.390
that's the wrong thing.

00:26:05.390 --> 00:26:08.220
So it really scares me in that regard.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.980
Many of you have already done this, but this
is me.

00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.500
These are my DNA results.

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.990
Did it overnight tell me exactly what was
going on.

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:17.990
No.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.010
But it was somewhat of a religious moment
for me, because all of a sudden, I looked

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.980
and I knew more about me.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:27.020
I realized I have a 42% chance of having a
heart attack.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.010
I had a normal cholesterol.

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:31.470
Based on that, I went on a statin.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:32.740
We'll talk about that data in a minute.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:33.740
I'm on an aspirin.

00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.560
I'm lean body mass.

00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:36.560
I exercise.

00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:37.560
I actually changed behaviors.

00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.560
I eat better.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.380
When I saw myself on a piece of paper.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.410
We always view ourselves different than we
really are.

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:47.330
It changed me.

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:50.090
But it's not only your genes.

00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.530
This is a chart where the black is the genes,
the white is environment.

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:57.511
Almost every disease, there's an environmental
part that we can control, and there's a genetic

00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:00.250
part that we can blame our parents for.

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:04.400
Although we like to blame our parents for
everything, none of these diseases are deterministic.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.780
They don't just happen.

00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.280
We can prevent them.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:14.020
Whether it be by behavior, changing environment,
or actually drugs, all of them can help.

00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:19.040
When we talk about drugs, and we'll talk more
about statins, but I get vilified saying I'm

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.930
a shill for the pharmaceutical company.

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.200
"Agus is out there pushing drugs.

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.110
He works for them.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.780
He doesn't want to push the natural things
because then he'll be out of business in treating

00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780
disease."

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.730
The drugs I push-- You know how much a statin
costs?

00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:38.190
Without health insurance, you can go to Wal-Mart
and get a 90 day supply for $9.

00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:39.350
These are generics.

00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:40.610
These are available.

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:46.370
These will radically change healthcare when
we start to look at the data.

00:27:46.370 --> 00:27:48.270
Aspirin.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:53.520
An aspirin a day, $3 a year to take baby aspirin,
81 mg a year.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:58.170
If you start to look at the data, after five
years of aspirin, death due to GI cancer down

00:27:58.170 --> 00:28:00.490
54%.

00:28:00.490 --> 00:28:04.970
One case of colon cancer to a company like
Google costs $247,000.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:12.390
Again, if you can reduce that by half by saying,
"Take an aspirin", I don't get why people

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.450
aren't doing it more.

00:28:14.450 --> 00:28:15.670
After 20 years, death.

00:28:15.670 --> 00:28:17.690
Death is a bad side effect.

00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:19.850
Death due to prostate cancer down 10%.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:21.870
Lung cancer, 30%.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:25.610
Colo-rectal cancer, 40, esophageal cancer,
60%.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:28.390
You start to look at this data.

00:28:28.390 --> 00:28:31.930
You start to say-- Listen, I'm not saying
anybody should take a pill.

00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:35.820
But I'm saying that conversation with a physician
needs to happen.

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.290
You need to say, because there are reasons
why you shouldn't be on it.

00:28:39.290 --> 00:28:43.420
But you need to have to conversation and say,
"Listen, I understand there's data.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:44.420
This may benefit me.

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:45.860
What are the downsides?

00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:50.980
Talk about me as an individual, given my family
history, given my genetics, given my risk

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:52.059
factors.

00:28:52.059 --> 00:28:54.840
I want to know why I'm not on something like
this."

00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:00.360
If you're a company and you say to your employees,
"Listen, you can do whatever you want.

00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.850
But if you have that discussion with your
doctor, I'm going to give you a discount on

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:06.340
your health insurance, because it's going
to benefit us."

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:12.470
Michael Dell was a hero to me in that he said,
"Listen, I have 105,000 employees at Dell.

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.000
They're welcome to smoke.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.450
But if they smoke, they're going to have a
different health insurance cost than the non-smokers.

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:23.570
Because why should smokers be subsidized by
the non-smokers?"

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:25.800
That data are profound.

00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.920
We need to push and change.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.270
Obviously, it's aggressive.

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:30.520
People would get upset.

00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:34.660
But we're the number one spender in healthcare
in the world, and our results are dismal.

00:29:34.660 --> 00:29:38.380
16 1/2% of GDP and growing every year.

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:44.350
Unless we start to enact things and change
and prevent, it ain't going to get smaller.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:46.220
You start to look at drugs like statins.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:50.580
Again, these are prescription drugs now, although
about 6 months ago, they were filed to go

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.580
over-the-counter.

00:29:51.580 --> 00:29:52.580
They're generic.

00:29:52.580 --> 00:30:00.200
Again, they are inexpensive, costing about
$36 for an entire year of treatment.

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.020
You start to look at the data.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:05.230
The Jupiter study, which was really a pivotal
study because it took people who had normal

00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.230
cholesterol.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.850
A normal cholesterol.

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.309
Not a high cholesterol, a normal cholesterol.

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:12.180
They put them on a pill a day.

00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:16.770
What it did was it delayed heart attack and
stroke by over a decade.

00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:20.750
Many cancers reduced their incidence by double
digit percentages.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:24.270
Yes, a percent of people or less will have
some side effects.

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.270
It's 100% reversible.

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:26.809
If you have it, you stop.

00:30:26.809 --> 00:30:32.350
But again, if we can have this dramatic effect
on disease, why aren't we using it more?

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:34.060
The cost is so low.

00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:37.070
Again, I'm not getting why we're not doing
it.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:40.440
And yet, we do the other side, which is we
take pills.

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:44.250
Ends up costing more than these pills I just
talked about.

00:30:44.250 --> 00:30:47.400
39,000 women tracked over 19 years.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:52.270
You can criticize all the study all you want,
but they looked at women who took vitamins.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:57.910
Vitamin B6, folic acid, and copper, and iron
versus women who didn't.

00:30:57.910 --> 00:31:00.630
Actually, the women who took the vitamins
were healthier baseline.

00:31:00.630 --> 00:31:01.970
They were skinnier.

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:04.390
They had less diabetes.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.030
They looked at them and said, "What's the
difference in the outcome?

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.290
Well, a 15% higher death rate in the women
who took the supplements."

00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:16.110
15% higher death rate in the women who took
the supplements.

00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:19.160
I look at that and I say, "Whew.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:22.740
By the year 2004, 65% of women in this country
were taking supplements."

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.910
I said, "There's got to be some data behind
it, or why would all these women be doing

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:27.910
it?

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:33.340
Why would it be a multi, multibillion dollar
industry if there weren't some benefit there

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:34.340
to it?"

00:31:34.340 --> 00:31:36.710
Then I look on the internet, and this is just
in the last couple months.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:40.800
These are all the headlines about vitamin
D. According to this, it can cure every disease

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.320
known to mankind.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.080
I mean, that's great.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.850
Then I look and said, "There's got to be data
here.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.420
There's got to be data why this happens."

00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:54.870
In the United States, now, over 75% of us
are quote low in vitamin D. There's data that

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:59.080
there's an epidemic of low vitamin D over
the last decade.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.230
As we spend more time indoors, wear sunscreen,
vitamin D levels are coming down.

00:32:03.230 --> 00:32:06.179
Yet, hip fracture rates are also down over
that same period.

00:32:06.179 --> 00:32:10.630
So it starts to make you wonder why is that
really the case?

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:11.630
What is normal?

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.160
Who defines what a normal value is?

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.450
When I was born, I didn't come with an ingredient
manual that says, "Your normal value of vitamin

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.490
D should be X."

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:22.559
Because remember, vitamin D is a network,
not an individual node.

00:32:22.559 --> 00:32:27.170
There's vitamin D, there's the receptor, and
then there are six signaling molecules.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.100
All we're measuring is one part of a network.

00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:34.070
So if you've low vitamin D, it probably means
you've got a high binding receptor.

00:32:34.070 --> 00:32:35.929
Or you've got an elevated number of receptors.

00:32:35.929 --> 00:32:39.820
Or one of the signaling molecules is a little
bit higher than somebody else.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:43.490
Yet, we look at this and we all start saying,
"Hey, we're low in vitamin D.

00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:45.200
We've got to correct that."

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:49.470
But part of it comes from the notion that
if you go to your doctor and he or she draws

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:52.830
arbitrary lab values, because unfortunately
most of them are somewhat arbitrary, and they

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.030
say, "Come back in a year", you say, "Listen.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.030
I shouldn't have gone.

00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:58.010
There was no value from going to my doctor.

00:32:58.010 --> 00:32:59.090
That wellness visit.

00:32:59.090 --> 00:33:00.090
He didn't tell me to do anything.

00:33:00.090 --> 00:33:01.510
Or she didn't say anything different."

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:03.060
They say, "Vitamin D's low.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:05.490
Take vitamin D." You perceive value.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.660
That physician perceives they gave you value.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.230
That perception is key.

00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:14.950
About 2 and 1/2 years ago, the World Health
Organization came out with a blanket statement

00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:17.450
saying, "Cell phones may cause brain cancer."

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:20.630
There was a panic around the world.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:24.330
If you start to look at what is the root data
they went on, what they did was they looked

00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.590
at 26,000 people with brain cancers.

00:33:26.590 --> 00:33:32.420
They asked the brain cancer patient and the
spouse, "How much did you use the cell phone?"

00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.210
When they answered, it was almost 2 and 1/2
times more in the brain cancer patient than

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:37.210
the spouse.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.470
So spouses are a good control.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.410
Pretty similar genetics, same environment,
eat the same, live the same.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:44.170
And 2 and 1/2 [inaudible] more cell phone
usage.

00:33:44.170 --> 00:33:46.410
Well, clearly, there may be an association.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.120
A clever group went and said, "Let's audit
the cell phone records, because we can do

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:51.120
that."

00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.430
They went back and they were exactly the same,
because human perception is we blame something.

00:33:56.430 --> 00:33:59.320
"I have brain cancer, I must have done something
wrong.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.640
Well, the cell phone, that's why.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.940
I talk on the cell phone."

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.600
So they perceive they did it differently.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.349
You went to breast cancer patients, 2000 breast
cancer patients, and you say, "What was your

00:34:08.349 --> 00:34:10.889
diet before and after you were diagnosed with
breast cancer?"

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.440
Uniformly, the women said, "My diet was horrible.

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.440
I have breast cancer.

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:15.440
I saw the light.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:16.440
Now I'm healthy."

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:20.340
When they went back and audited what they
ate, it was exactly the same.

00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.090
So again, human nature is we've got to blame
something.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:25.770
There's something-- When something bad happens,
something's wrong.

00:34:25.770 --> 00:34:30.260
"Something happens to my child, it must be
that vaccine they got, because there's got

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.780
to be a reason for it."

00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:34.730
Or "If I have this problem, it's got to be
because of something I did or something in

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:36.179
the environment", etcetera.

00:34:36.179 --> 00:34:37.619
We all want to blame something.

00:34:37.619 --> 00:34:41.840
But let's go back and look at the data of
vitamin D. They took women 70 years and older,

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.660
over 2000 of them, and they gave them a very
high dose of vitamin D. That raised their

00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:49.470
serum vitamin D level for a year.

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.730
26% higher fracture rate.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.090
Not lower.

00:34:53.090 --> 00:34:55.380
Higher fracture rate.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:01.930
So all of a sudden, women are taking vitamin
D to increase their bone density and prevent

00:35:01.930 --> 00:35:02.930
fractures.

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:07.750
And yet, this is a very well respected journal
with a couple thousand patients.

00:35:07.750 --> 00:35:09.950
So an increase in bone fracture rate.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:10.950
Hmm.

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:12.640
Remember, the body's homeostatic.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.250
You take a bolus of something, you down-regulate
receptors and you screw up the signaling.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:19.350
What's the only reason we tan?

00:35:19.350 --> 00:35:21.850
To block vitamin D absorption.

00:35:21.850 --> 00:35:27.109
Right there, evolution has a very difficult
way, it requires a lot of energy, that we've

00:35:27.109 --> 00:35:32.080
evolved so we don't have too much vitamin
D. Yet we take these big boluses of pills

00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080
all the time.

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.690
Then, well, "maybe the dose was too high."

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:44.480
So they did a study in women where they took
women-- oh!-- who, in the nurses' health studies.

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.080
Again, over 20,000 women were looked at.

00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:50.510
They gave them vitamin D and calcium.

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.220
The regular vitamin D and calcium that most
people take.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:55.710
The Os-Cal D or whatever brand it is.

00:35:55.710 --> 00:36:00.170
In that study, there was no effect on bone
fracture by taking calcium and vitamin D.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:04.251
There were side effects that caused kidney
stones, it affected gastric upset, all of

00:36:04.251 --> 00:36:05.430
those things.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:06.930
Yet no benefit.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:12.580
Most women, most women over the age of 60,
take calcium and vitamin D.

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:15.490
The first question to ask your doctor if they
say, "You should be on calcium and vitamin

00:36:15.490 --> 00:36:16.990
D" is "Why?"

00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:20.460
Osteoporosis, we know, is a genetic disorder.

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:23.560
Taking calcium and vitamin D doesn't make
it better.

00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:24.670
Yet we do it.

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:27.830
Again, something a little screwy there, in
my mind.

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:28.830
And then this study.

00:36:28.830 --> 00:36:34.200
This was a $240 million study, almost a quarter
billion dollars stamped by the US government.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.200
Vitamin E.

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.210
We know vitamin E's a great antioxidant.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.440
Everybody's taking it to prevent prostate
cancer.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:42.010
Let's see how much it prevents prostate cancer.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:43.770
So they gave men 400 units.

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.210
This is the same amount in a multivitamin.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:47.210
They gave them that.

00:36:47.210 --> 00:36:48.670
After three years, they halted the study.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:50.530
A quarter billion dollar study.

00:36:50.530 --> 00:36:51.530
Why?

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:55.230
Because there was a 17% higher incidence of
prostate cancer in the men who took vitamin

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:59.580
E. That lasted for three, four years after
stopping the vitamin.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:04.000
A 17% increase in the most common non skin
cancer in men.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.869
First of all, the impact on the individual
is staggering.

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:11.570
The impact on society, on companies, on our
health insurance, is staggering because we're

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:13.050
taking this.

00:37:13.050 --> 00:37:15.970
Again, what am I missing here?

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:23.130
We're talking a $20 to 30 billion impact on
healthcare by this excess in men diagnosed

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.720
with prostate cancer.

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720
Then you look.

00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.150
The government said, "Listen.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:28.910
Maybe there are some studies that we're missing
here."

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:35.000
So they looked at 63 studies with more than
500 people in a randomized fashion with multivitamins

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.740
and heart disease and cancer.

00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:38.420
None of them showed a benefit.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.530
Zero showed a benefit.

00:37:40.530 --> 00:37:43.170
I've just showed you a number of studies with
clear negatives.

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:46.640
And yet, none has yet shown a benefit.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:51.460
In 2004, they looked and they said, "People
who smoked, or former smokers, we've got to

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.460
give them high dose antioxidants to prevent
lung cancer, because they're dying like in

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:57.730
droves of lung cancer."

00:37:57.730 --> 00:38:02.359
28% higher lung cancer when they took these
supplements.

00:38:02.359 --> 00:38:06.380
17% higher death rate when they took these
supplements.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:10.870
Again, pills, I'm not sure they actually have
benefits.

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.390
Clearly, they're causing harm.

00:38:13.390 --> 00:38:17.700
The other side of the equation is looking
at how technology's going to fit in.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.630
Because clearly, there probably are some people
that benefit from taking pills.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:24.240
If you're pregnant, you need to take prenatal
vitamins.

00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:28.170
There's certain eye conditions were vitamins
have been shown to help.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:29.760
Maybe some people with their diet need it.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.109
But we need technology to start to say who
needs what, because blanket statements like

00:38:34.109 --> 00:38:37.640
I'm making probably aren't the best thing
going forward.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:42.940
In 1976, if you thought you were pregnant,
or your spouse thought she was pregnant, you

00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:46.300
took a tube of blood, you went to a hospital
because it couldn't be done anywhere but a

00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:47.300
hospital.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.420
Every hospital in the country had a rabbit
floor.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.680
We took that blood, and we injected it into
a poor rabbit.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.870
Five days later, we sacrificed the rabbit
and we looked at the rabbits ovaries.

00:38:56.870 --> 00:38:59.910
If they were enlarged, you were pregnant.

00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:02.580
That was the state of the art in 1976.

00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:06.500
Well, 1977, the first proteomic test was approved
by the FDA.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:11.360
It was a $10 urine-based test for pregnancy.

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.370
Rabbits over the world rejoiced.

00:39:13.370 --> 00:39:16.730
[laughter] All of a sudden, we had a binary
outcome.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:18.270
Yes/no whether you're pregnant or not.

00:39:18.270 --> 00:39:23.671
It radically changed reproductive health,
women's health, child mortality because we

00:39:23.671 --> 00:39:26.470
can actually give prenatal vitamins, we can
take care of women because we knew they were

00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:28.000
pregnant.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.410
Changed everything.

00:39:29.410 --> 00:39:31.840
We need more technologies like this.

00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:36.359
We now have the capacity with newer technology,
to actually bring them in.

00:39:36.359 --> 00:39:37.359
This is the proteomics.

00:39:37.359 --> 00:39:38.359
This is the cover on the book.

00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:42.820
This is that 20,000 foot view of the state
of the system, where, instead of--.

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.869
In our country, we do a colonoscopy at age
50, because that's where the risk rewards

00:39:46.869 --> 00:39:49.240
come together, and that's what's cost effective.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:50.240
I love that word.

00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.520
It's cost effective to do.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:55.590
Well, what do you say to the 4000 people in
the United States last year who died of colon

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.320
cancer under the age of 40?

00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.040
"You weren't cost effective?"

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.610
What do you say to the fact that only 17%
of people who should have colonoscopies do,

00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:06.980
at age 50?

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:10.300
What if we had a blood test to say who had
a colonic polyp?

00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:11.980
First of all, we would do it in the right
people.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.440
We'd have almost 100% compliance.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:15.810
And the other is, we have a quality metric.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:18.100
Did that doc get the polyp our or not?

00:40:18.100 --> 00:40:20.430
Because right now, there is no quality metric.

00:40:20.430 --> 00:40:23.650
That's what technology can do, is start to
personalize things.

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.060
We're not far away from that.

00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.530
There's a newer technology coming out that's
pretty wild.

00:40:28.530 --> 00:40:34.320
Turns out, you and I have 10 fold more bacteria
in us than we do cells in our body.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:38.220
If someone is in China, you look at the incidence
of prostate cancer and breast cancer, it's

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.030
1/10 what ours is.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:43.190
After they move to the United States, after
a decade, it starts to approach ours.

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:45.340
"Well, then it's the Burger King and the McDonald's."

00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:47.470
Turns out, that's not the case.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.500
It's the bacteria in the water.

00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:51.110
It's our microbiome.

00:40:51.110 --> 00:40:52.710
They get populated with our bacteria.

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:55.540
Well, those bacteria, they control how you
metabolize your food.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:56.970
They control your hormone levels.

00:40:56.970 --> 00:41:01.280
For the first time ever this year, we've learned
to quantitate them and actually look at what

00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:03.430
type are populating what individual.

00:41:03.430 --> 00:41:07.040
I guarantee you, over the next several years,
we're going to start to modulate them to reduce

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.470
risk for disease, which will be powerful.

00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:12.410
I'm a believer in prevention.

00:41:12.410 --> 00:41:13.540
I look at the data.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:16.780
There are little things one can do that can
radically affect health.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:22.230
In the Framingham heart study, one of the
most protective effects wasn't what you ate,

00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:23.680
it wasn't your weight.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.109
It was actually owning a dog.

00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:27.109
We look at the data.

00:41:27.109 --> 00:41:28.109
"A dog?

00:41:28.109 --> 00:41:29.109
Well, it relaxes you."

00:41:29.109 --> 00:41:30.170
Well, it's not that it relaxes you.

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:31.890
It puts you on a regular schedule.

00:41:31.890 --> 00:41:37.070
If you start to look at the data on regularity,
it is profound for health.

00:41:37.070 --> 00:41:41.450
If you have your lunch today at noon, and
then tomorrow at 2:00, for two hours, stress

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:42.869
hormones go up.

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:45.310
When stress hormones go up, the body goes
in a protective mode.

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:46.310
It says, "Hey, listen.

00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:47.310
There might be a lion coming.

00:41:47.310 --> 00:41:48.820
I've got to really save energy.

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.109
I've got to shut down."

00:41:50.109 --> 00:41:53.790
So you get about a 25-30% decrease in cognition.

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:57.410
You get about a 36% decrease in exercise performance.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:42:02.140
You actually gain weight because you lower
metabolism dramatically to try to save energy.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:07.570
So if you eat on a regular schedule, sleep
on a regular schedule, dramatic effect on

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:08.570
health.

00:42:08.570 --> 00:42:12.720
It's the person who randomly goes by places
like this and grabs and apple that hurt themselves.

00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:17.050
If you have an apple every day at 3:00, greatest
thing in the world.

00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:20.109
Regularity is key.

00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:22.550
Almost as important as what you eat.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:27.800
Very powerful, costs nothing, and can have
a dramatic effect on health.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.310
So I'm happy to stop here, answer questions.

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:33.490
I know we've went through a lot and went all
over the place.

00:42:33.490 --> 00:42:35.040
But all the data is in the book.

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.849
We're proud of it.

00:42:36.849 --> 00:42:37.849
It's aggressive.

00:42:37.849 --> 00:42:40.060
I'd love to get comments back from you.

00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.060
Email me.

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.099
Tell me what you think.

00:42:43.099 --> 00:42:45.250
But again, questions, we're happy to talk.

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.140
I appreciate it.

00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.140
[applause]

00:42:48.140 --> 00:42:49.140
&gt;&gt;Agus: Yes.

00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:53.420
&gt;&gt;male #1: : Thanks for coming to talk.

00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:55.300
&gt;&gt;Agus: Thank you.

00:42:55.300 --> 00:43:01.760
&gt;&gt;male #1: I guess I'm curious about what
you would say about the way people interact

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.450
with their doctors.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:08.630
At the start of your talk, you mentioned that
in China, they're going to implement some

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:10.700
of the stuff as law.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.690
In the United States, it's going to be much
more decentralized and debated.

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:20.510
I can go to a doctor who graduated medical
school 20 years ago or 40 years ago or 5 years

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:23.060
ago, and they're probably have very different
reactions.

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:29.011
But you advised us to not even take an aspirin
a day without going to that.

00:43:29.011 --> 00:43:31.099
&gt;&gt;Agus: I want that discussion to happen,
you're right.

00:43:31.099 --> 00:43:32.370
One of the things we put early in the book.

00:43:32.370 --> 00:43:33.370
You can download it.

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:35.940
It's a four page questionnaire I want you
to fill out before you go to your doctor.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:39.540
There's this old adage, and obviously you
here know well which is "Enough data, error

00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:40.540
goes away."

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:42.640
When you go to your doctor, they check your
blood pressure at 1:00.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:44.380
Well, who ever checks it in the morning when
you get up?

00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:45.380
At night when you go to bed?

00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:47.420
When you're pissed off after a phone call?

00:43:47.420 --> 00:43:49.020
I want a lot of data.

00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:50.500
I want you to look at your own metrics.

00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:51.960
You go on with all your data.

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.390
But if your doctor's not going to listen,
go to a different doctor.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:43:57.330
It's a free market system.

00:43:57.330 --> 00:44:00.180
The only way we're going to change it is from
the ground up.

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:03.750
I wrote this book so each of us can be in
charge and go in with that data.

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:05.470
Go in and say, "Listen.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:06.570
The studies show this.

00:44:06.570 --> 00:44:08.390
I fit that study.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:11.200
What do you think?" and start to have a real
discussion.

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:14.420
You can go in with everything written down
in this questionnaire before you go in, so

00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:18.090
that five minutes, if you're lucky, ten minutes
with your doctor, you can actually use it

00:44:18.090 --> 00:44:19.250
correctly.

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:20.250
But you're right.

00:44:20.250 --> 00:44:21.290
We have to change the doctors.

00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:24.340
We are incentivized, and I'm as guilty as
anybody else, for treatment.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:26.590
We're not incentivized for prevention.

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.240
We need to change that in our country.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:30.930
The average time on a health plan is 4 1/2
years.

00:44:30.930 --> 00:44:33.170
Your health plan doesn't care about preventing
your heart disease.

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:36.609
It's not going to happen for 10 years, and
you'll be on somebody else's plan.

00:44:36.609 --> 00:44:39.930
We have to change that way of thinking, and
we're going to do it from the ground up.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:42.150
&gt;&gt;male #1: Thank you.

00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:46.510
&gt;&gt;male #2: [clears throat] One of the [clears
throat] fascinating and compelling points

00:44:46.510 --> 00:44:51.560
I think you made was that we should look at
the proteome and look for ways to modify your

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:54.030
biochemistry to conform to that template.

00:44:54.030 --> 00:44:55.030
&gt;&gt;Agus: Yes.

00:44:55.030 --> 00:44:57.000
&gt;&gt;male #2: I assume that's a good starting
point.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.480
But do think that there's going to be a need
to look at it as a dynamic system where the

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:07.820
template will adapt over age or time or environmental
conditions?

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:10.060
How do we figure out the right template for
a person?

00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:11.640
&gt;&gt;Agus: With enough data.

00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:13.260
The thing is, I'd love there--.

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:16.080
One day, when you go to your doctor, he pricks
your finger.

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.790
It goes into some technology that profiles
it.

00:45:18.790 --> 00:45:21.700
You're populating the data set as well as
getting something back from it.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:26.210
Just akin to my search on Google is better
today than it was yesterday, I want medicine

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:27.630
to improve on a daily basis.

00:45:27.630 --> 00:45:28.630
And we're not.

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:29.630
We don't have common data elements.

00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:30.630
It's shocking.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:33.120
You call it a broken leg, I call it a fractured
leg.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:36.660
Nobody's standardized data elements and nomenclature
in my field yet.

00:45:36.660 --> 00:45:39.840
It is absolutely from the 1920s.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:40.840
We need to change that.

00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.360
The technology is here.

00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.410
We've got to use it right.

00:45:43.410 --> 00:45:46.350
Building the standards to allow it to actually
grow.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:47.350
Yeah.

00:45:47.350 --> 00:45:52.280
&gt;&gt;male #3: I recently saw a documentary about
Stanislaw Burzynski.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.150
It seemed like a really interesting documentary.

00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:59.070
I looked online to get more information, and
it seemed like the government and the entire

00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:01.740
medical community thought this guy was a quack.

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.200
&gt;&gt;Agus: So you really think there's a conspiracy?

00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.000
This is a guy in Texas who now has moved to
Mexico who has a drug that he developed called

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.130
antineoplaston.

00:46:09.130 --> 00:46:13.220
He charges cash, $60,000, to give it to you.

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:16.650
He argues, there's a conspiracy-- What he
does is he went to all the cancer meetings,

00:46:16.650 --> 00:46:17.650
stands up in the audience.

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:20.660
He goes to some random meetings and he stands
up and starts talking about it.

00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:23.310
Everyone's like, "Sit down, be quietâ, because
it's interrupting whoever's talking about

00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:24.310
something else.

00:46:24.310 --> 00:46:25.360
He films it and shows these videos.

00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.720
"The community is against me."

00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:29.849
They're against him because he's interrupting
somebody else speaking.

00:46:29.849 --> 00:46:34.240
There have been four randomized studies done
with this, causing increased death, shorter

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.420
life span, than not.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:38.650
He's out there saying, "There's a conspiracy.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.830
The government and doctors want to hide it
because we're going to take away their business

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:43.330
if I cure all disease."

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:45.670
&gt;&gt;male #3: : I feel like--

00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:47.210
&gt;&gt;Agus: What am I missing here?

00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:50.349
&gt;&gt;male #3: : --he doesn't seem trustworthy,
which is why I didn't totally--

00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:52.369
&gt;&gt;Agus: : There were four randomized trials.

00:46:52.369 --> 00:46:53.599
It didn't work.

00:46:53.599 --> 00:46:54.599
Made people live shorter.

00:46:54.599 --> 00:46:58.780
&gt;&gt;male #3: I was just more curious about--
I'm more interested in experimentation because

00:46:58.780 --> 00:47:01.080
bodies are different.

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.410
What might work for you might not work for
me and vice versa.

00:47:03.410 --> 00:47:10.030
I'm wondering if you feel like there's something
within the system that just doesn't allow

00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:12.380
as much experimentation as there could be.

00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:15.250
&gt;&gt;Agus: That's a great point.

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.060
By definition, with advanced cancer, you want
to be on a clinical trial because standard

00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.099
therapy doesn't work.

00:47:20.099 --> 00:47:22.710
You want to experiment and do new things.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.810
We are very much risk averse in our world.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:27.760
The capital markets have been closed to biotechnology
for the last 15 years.

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.891
There are very few of any biotech companies.

00:47:29.891 --> 00:47:32.190
Pharmaceutical companies are bonds.

00:47:32.190 --> 00:47:33.640
They want to return 5% a year.

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:35.760
They're not taking risk and doing their clinical
trials.

00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.589
One of the arguments in the book is I think
we have enough drugs out there.

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:41.109
We've just got to learn how to use them, and
we're not.

00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:42.109
So I agree with you.

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.520
We need to take more experiments.

00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.369
Cancer patients especially are willing to
take any risk in the world because they've

00:47:46.369 --> 00:47:47.760
got no choice.

00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:52.210
And yet, most of the time we don't do that.

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.710
It's public that I was one of Steve Jobs'
doctors.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.390
He puts in his book how we sequenced his genome.

00:47:57.390 --> 00:47:58.390
We didn't sequenced his genome.

00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:59.839
We sequenced a couple of genes.

00:47:59.839 --> 00:48:02.770
We looked at it, and everything we did was
part of clinical trials.

00:48:02.770 --> 00:48:04.690
He went on drugs, and so did everybody else
there.

00:48:04.690 --> 00:48:06.500
I'm a believer in trials.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.250
I'm a believer in doing randomized clinical
trials, or clinical trials that are single

00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:12.730
armed to see if these drugs work.

00:48:12.730 --> 00:48:14.280
And many of them do.

00:48:14.280 --> 00:48:16.670
I chair one of the brain cancer foundations.

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:20.210
About seven or eight years ago, I got a call
from a doctor in Galveston, Texas, who said,

00:48:20.210 --> 00:48:24.119
"I give this drug called Avastin, a Genentech
drug, to a patient with glioblastoma, and

00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:25.119
it worked."

00:48:25.119 --> 00:48:26.119
I go, "There's no way.

00:48:26.119 --> 00:48:27.630
It's too big to even get across the blood-brain
barrier."

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:29.700
This story's in the book.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:30.770
She said, "Well, here are the scans.

00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:31.780
They look real."

00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:33.410
So we did a trial on people who failed chemo.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.400
They have weeks to live.

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.500
And at six months, nobody progressed.

00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:42.000
This drug that didn't even cross the blood-brain
barrier worked because it bound a protein

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.240
and lowered the pressure of the cancer.

00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:46.460
When you lower the pressure, the cancer stops
growing.

00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.349
A year later, it's FDA approved and standard
treatment for brain cancer.

00:48:50.349 --> 00:48:53.510
So we need to keep our eyes open and learn
from every experience.

00:48:53.510 --> 00:48:55.850
Be they with somebody who's a little questionable
or not.

00:48:55.850 --> 00:49:01.050
But right now, all we do is we have to report
the negatives to the FDA, the side effects

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:02.050
to the FDA.

00:49:02.050 --> 00:49:04.560
I have a good response, a cure, I never have
to report it.

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:05.760
Nobody knows about it.

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.760
It's hidden.

00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:08.119
We need to change that.

00:49:08.119 --> 00:49:09.450
We need to get data out there.

00:49:09.450 --> 00:49:14.560
We need to talk about our experiences and
learn from them, because we're not now.

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.560
Yeah.

00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:20.339
&gt;&gt;male #4: I really like a lot of the examples
you're giving about the different kinds--

00:49:20.339 --> 00:49:26.619
sorry-- kinds of inflammation that can occur
from sitting or obviously, not eating at the

00:49:26.619 --> 00:49:27.619
same time every day.

00:49:27.619 --> 00:49:30.940
What I'm really curious about: is there some
kind of centralized source where you know

00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.840
the risk factors of various types of inflammation?

00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:35.890
Because I think this is missing out there.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.670
&gt;&gt;Agus: You're 100% right.

00:49:37.670 --> 00:49:42.280
We have a poor man's metric now, which is
called high sensitivity c-reactive protein.

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.540
But we need to get better metrics for measuring
different kinds of inflammation, optimizing

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.720
whether it be the shoes you wear.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:50.130
Your feet hurt at the end of the day, that's
inflammation.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:51.130
I want to optimize.

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:54.430
I want to have a marker to say there's less
inflammation or more.

00:49:54.430 --> 00:49:57.369
This is where we need to put the research
focus, where technology needs to go.

00:49:57.369 --> 00:49:58.390
And it's not right now.

00:49:58.390 --> 00:49:59.450
But you're right.

00:49:59.450 --> 00:50:03.420
&gt;&gt;male #4: For example, relative to other
factors, not eating at the same time every

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.430
day--.

00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:07.690
It's great that it yields an insight.

00:50:07.690 --> 00:50:10.940
I guess there's other types of inflammation
that we're unaware of, but that inflammation

00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:12.500
in particular, how does that--

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.700
&gt;&gt;Agus: That's not inflammation as much as
stress hormones.

00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.780
Eating at the same time.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:19.860
But yeah, we can't quantitate that for an
individual.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.370
We can only quantitate that for the collective
group.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:25.330
What you're getting at is that we want to
start to do it for your individual, and say,

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:27.740
"For you, it's better to do X, Y, or Z."

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:31.030
That's what I hope technology will be able
to yield.

00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:34.270
Right now, the only mature technology we have
is genetics.

00:50:34.270 --> 00:50:35.270
The others are immature.

00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:38.880
But genetics, I mean, it's akin to standing
outside two Chinese restaurants and looking

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:39.880
at the ingredient list.

00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.880
They're exactly the same.

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.599
You taste the food, one could be awesome,
one could be horrible.

00:50:44.599 --> 00:50:46.339
Genetics is your ingredient list.

00:50:46.339 --> 00:50:50.599
What's going on in that moment in time, that's--
There may be the metabolomics or the microbiomics

00:50:50.599 --> 00:50:55.160
or the proteomics.

00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:56.840
That's the next generation.

00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:03.370
&gt;&gt;male #5: You mentioned about not taking
the flu shot.

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:04.619
That actually surprised me.

00:51:04.619 --> 00:51:10.670
What you're saying is, if you get flu, that
has negative consequences later, 10 years

00:51:10.670 --> 00:51:11.910
down the road.

00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:14.430
Which is opposed to what you hear.

00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:16.230
"You're not getting sick enough."

00:51:16.230 --> 00:51:20.310
Generally, we basically have very good, compared
to you live in other countries where you get

00:51:20.310 --> 00:51:21.390
sick more often.

00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:25.980
Generally, your body has more immune built
up.

00:51:25.980 --> 00:51:31.410
Essentially, it doesn't have auto-- you have
less autoimmune diseases because your body's

00:51:31.410 --> 00:51:33.440
not fighting any diseases.

00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.740
&gt;&gt;Agus: I guess I'm missing the point.

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.220
&gt;&gt;male #6: [inaudible] You're better off having
been exposed to--

00:51:39.220 --> 00:51:41.030
&gt;&gt;Agus: Well, you are being exposed.

00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:42.720
A vaccines exposes you, but it's less inflammation.

00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.940
&gt;&gt;male #5: But the inflammation part, does
it-- Essentially, you're saying it lasts longer.

00:51:46.940 --> 00:51:49.520
Can you elaborate more on if you became sick
now.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:51.320
What are the downsides to that?

00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.390
&gt;&gt;Agus: I think of it very simply.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:57.060
If I give you a vaccine, you're going to make
a-- your arm hurts.

00:51:57.060 --> 00:51:58.839
You're making an inflammatory response.

00:51:58.839 --> 00:52:02.330
You're making antibodies against whatever
pathogen is in there.

00:52:02.330 --> 00:52:06.870
Again, if you're lucky and it was that flu
strain, you're not going to get sick that

00:52:06.870 --> 00:52:07.870
year.

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:10.770
If it's a different flu strain, your flu is
going to be less because you have cross-reactive

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:11.790
antibodies.

00:52:11.790 --> 00:52:14.849
But you get the flu, it's a staggering inflammatory
storm.

00:52:14.849 --> 00:52:15.849
You feel it.

00:52:15.849 --> 00:52:17.330
You can barely move for days.

00:52:17.330 --> 00:52:21.310
That inflammatory storm, your body shuts down
things like DNA repair and others to shunt

00:52:21.310 --> 00:52:23.930
its energy to fight off that viral infection.

00:52:23.930 --> 00:52:26.040
And bad things can happen down the road.

00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:27.040
Yes.

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.780
I think it's a good thing to be exposed to--.

00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:34.460
As a child we're exposed to multiple different
pathogens.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.060
We develop new responses over time.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.480
But vaccines are good.

00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:43.600
Vaccines expose you to these in an environment
where you don't get as much of this profound

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600
inflammation.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:49.980
&gt;&gt;male #5: But isn't it like, you'll need
a vaccine at the age when you are basically

00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.980
fit?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:52.130
Not such a good thing.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.550
I can understand why very early, you are--

00:52:54.550 --> 00:52:55.550
&gt;&gt;Agus: No.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.950
Again, the immune response, the small immune
response you make to a vaccine compared to

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:03.760
seven days of having an influenza, it's a
dramatic effect.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.770
At least, the data show that.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:09.180
&gt;&gt;male #5: You mentioned the rabbit study.

00:53:09.180 --> 00:53:12.290
Didn't the rabbit die when you actually inject
with human blood?

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:13.290
&gt;&gt;Agus: : No.

00:53:13.290 --> 00:53:14.290
It was plasma.

00:53:14.290 --> 00:53:15.290
It wasn't blood cells.

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:16.320
Just the plasma.

00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:17.660
Yes.

00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:21.610
The rabbit died when you cut off his [laughter]
or her head.

00:53:21.610 --> 00:53:22.610
Yes.

00:53:22.610 --> 00:53:25.490
&gt;&gt;male #7: I saw you on the Daily Show, so
my question might be in the book.

00:53:25.490 --> 00:53:30.589
But a lot of your presentation was very much
a blanket against vitamins.

00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:33.089
Vitamins or external supplements, in that
nature.

00:53:33.089 --> 00:53:37.680
In any age group or areas, do you have exceptions
for that, or is that your general philosophy?

00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680
&gt;&gt;Agus: Sure.

00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.880
I mean, pregnant women I think should be on
vitamins.

00:53:39.880 --> 00:53:41.940
We know that it helps for prenatal health.

00:53:41.940 --> 00:53:44.270
Again, I'm not blanket against vitamins.

00:53:44.270 --> 00:53:45.330
It's more as an example.

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:47.270
I want you to question everything you put
in your body.

00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:49.190
Say, "Why am I doing this?

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:50.980
Is there data that I should be taking this
pill?"

00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.760
I pray that one vitamin works.

00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:54.099
I'm not against them.

00:53:54.099 --> 00:53:55.710
I just pray they work.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.190
Everybody in the world juices now.

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:01.630
Once you put a vegetable or fruit into a blender,
it's all degraded.

00:54:01.630 --> 00:54:03.359
Within hundredths of a millisecond.

00:54:03.359 --> 00:54:06.070
James Lind, captain of the British Royal Navy,
amazing guy.

00:54:06.070 --> 00:54:09.710
He won the Battle of Trafalgar, he beat the
French, because he had limes on his ship.

00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:12.380
His troops didn't get scurvy, and the French
did.

00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:15.630
Like any good entrepreneur, at the end, he
said, "I happened to sell the extra limes."

00:54:15.630 --> 00:54:16.990
He sold the lime juice.

00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.990
It didn't work.

00:54:17.990 --> 00:54:18.990
Didn't cure scurvy.

00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.990
Why?

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:21.400
As soon as you squeeze that lime, everything's
degraded.

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.490
I just want you to ask the question.

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:25.490
Everything you do.

00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:27.000
"Why am I doing it for me?"

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.680
&gt;&gt;male #7: You talked very positively about
statins.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.349
Is that at a certain age group, or--

00:54:31.349 --> 00:54:37.930
&gt;&gt;Agus: If you look at the data, people with
average risk factors, they start around 40

00:54:37.930 --> 00:54:39.270
showing a benefit.

00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:42.610
People with high risk factors, if they start
at 20, there's more of a benefit.

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.070
It really depends on-- If everyone in your
family had heart attacks in their 40s, you

00:54:46.070 --> 00:54:47.470
want to start earlier.

00:54:47.470 --> 00:54:50.510
If you've got no history of heart disease
or cancer in your family, maybe you don't

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:52.050
want to do it at all.

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.589
So I really want that discussion to happen
with your doctor, based on you.

00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:59.880
But I think the discussions should happen
now, for all of us, in our 20s or 30s or 40s.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:00.880
Keep having it.

00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:00.881
[applause]
