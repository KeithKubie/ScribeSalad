00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.880
 Your eyes help you see the world. 

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.480
 But you can not see this point. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.480
 Really. 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.060
 If you close your left eye 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.740
 and look at this cross here with your right eye 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.220
 and slowly zoom in or out of your screen 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.020
 the point will disappear. 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.140
 This will find the exact location of your blind spot. 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:17.600
 The cells in the back of your eye 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.560
 turn the light into signals that 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 are sent to your brain. 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.980
 But they are missing here because 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.300
 here are the nerves and the blood vessels 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:25.480
 related to the eye 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.320
 And that's why you can not see everything in this area 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.780
 still known as a blind spot. 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.140
 If we add a line through the images and try again 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.340
 you will notice that your brain complements the information 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.360
 and makes you think the line is going on 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.360
 instead of thinking that there is a gap in what you see. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 You can also not see these 12 points at the same time for the same reason. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.380
 Try it; you will probably only see one part 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.600
 of them at the same time. 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.800
 The point your eye looks at is focused 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.380
 but your peripheral vision is not so good, so your brain 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.660
 often makes guesses about what's there. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.080
 And because there is a repeating gray line combination 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.740
 your brain thinks the rest of the image is the same 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.560
 and skips the black points until you look exactly at them. 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.880
 These rectangles do not blink at the same time right? 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.540
 What now? 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.920
 They are flashing at the same time 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.140
 but in fact it is not. 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.360
 And if we move the other figures to them 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.300
 just a few pixels, you'll see 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.420
 that they do not move again. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.200
 The environment has a direct impact on how you see it 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.040
 and judge things, even if the result is not accurate. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.020
 Do not you agree? 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.320
 Look at these blinking squares. 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.760
 What you may have missed is that 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.140
 the middle square does not blink at all 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.840
 And if we remove the outer square we will see that in fact 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.060
 is a single color. 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.520
 Now try to read the sentence in the square. (Can you read this?) 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.740
 Did you see the additional word? 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.980
 Your brain does not always notice mistakes like these 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.780
 because it does not affect the understanding of the sentence 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.560
 and your brain prefers to take a quick move rather than being completely accurate. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.880
 Try to look at the point in the middle. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000
 When the picture does not move, the colors change rapidly, 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.200
 but if it starts spinning 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.640
 Changing colors either disappears or slows down. 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.140
 Our eyes and brain have evolved to see 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.860
 but our vision still makes assumptions based on what we have learned, remembered or what we expect. 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.760
 And all these illusions / tricks take advantage of this. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.920
 In fact, it's an advantage to understand information quickly 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.000
 so instead of taking every detail into account in order to be 100% accurate 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.660
 which would overload the brain, he makes assumptions. 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.500
 Quick judgment allows us to 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.140
 we have quick reflexes and take faster, more conscious and unconscious decisions. 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.540
 an integral part of human nature. 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.580
 Like this halo, if you look at the center of the point long enough 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.080
 the brain will make her disappear 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.980
 He suggests that the information does not change and is not important 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.800
 as a result, you can not see it. 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.780
 Do you like luring your brain with illusions? 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.820
 We've made a playlist with our favorite illusions 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.520
 you can watch them by tapping the screen.
