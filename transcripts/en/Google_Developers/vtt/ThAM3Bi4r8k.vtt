CHRIS BROADFOOT: Hi everyone.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.950
My name's Chris Broadfoot.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.000
Welcome to another Google
Maps Developer Relations

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.320
Screencast. Today I'll be
showing you how to easily

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.140
create an interactive
store locator using

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.230
the Google Maps API.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.790
You might have already read this
great article on the maps

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.600
API developer documentation, but
the piece that's missing

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.760
is a really great
user interface.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.200
Introducing the Open Source
Store Locator Library

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.940
for the Maps API.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.905
This Utility Library makes it
simple for developers such as

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:34.530
yourselves to build a great
store locator application.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.060
You get many things for free,
including a list of nearby

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.950
stores, an info window that
shows details about the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.820
selected store, HTML5
GeoLocation, which will

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.560
determine a good initial
viewport for the user, along

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.220
with Street View, autocomplete
search like on

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.950
maps.google.com, and
importantly, driving

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.530
directions.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.000
It's also very extensible.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.210
You can customize your markers,
info windows, map

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.940
style, and anything else
you can think of.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.560
One important note, the
library's very flexible about

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.470
where the store data
comes from.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.050
The examples I'm going to show
you today have data coming

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.710
from a CSV file, but there's
an example in the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.770
documentation that shows
stores that come from a

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.820
database hosted on Google
App Engine.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.550
I'm going to begin by showing
you the example that's powered

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.132
by a CSV file.

00:01:22.132 --> 00:01:25.590
The location data has been
obtained through data.gov.au,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.590
and it's a list of all the
Medicare offices in Australia.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.810
The first thing you'll notice
is on the left, a list of

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.530
stores ordered by the distance
from the center of the map.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.960
I might want to change the
center to be where I currently

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.560
am so I see the store
closest to me.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.890
So I'm actually at the Google
Sydney office, so I'm going to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.170
go ahead and select that.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.745
You'll see that the
map updates to

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:46.810
show my current location.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.920
And I see a list of the stores
that are closest to the Google

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.320
Sydney office.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.780
Now, I don't really want to
venture into the city, so I'm

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.450
going to see the next closest
store that's not Sydney.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.200
But I live close to Lockhart, so
maybe I'll choose that one.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.160
I can go and hit Street
View to get an idea of

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.980
where the store is.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.686
That looks fine, I can get
plenty of parking there.

00:02:10.686 --> 00:02:13.270
I'm going to go ahead and zoom
in so I can get more of an

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.170
idea of where it is.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.545
And then maybe get some
driving directions.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.600
You'll see that the map handily
uses my current

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.480
location as the beginning
point, the Google Sydney

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.440
office, for the directions.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.250
And I get the regular directions
panel that you

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.680
might be familiar with from
using the Google Maps API.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.670
Let's look at one
final example.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.200
This one shows how you can
simply customize the map to

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.960
your liking.

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.490
Here we've customized the icons,
so we've branded the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.380
map using the Medicare logo.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.380
And you can see as we click
we've customized the info

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.950
window using a library
called InfoBubble.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.440
This is really great
to be able to brand

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.840
the map to your liking.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.660
Of course, you can style the
panel using CSS, and the map

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.730
using the Styled Maps API.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.920
So, you'd like one of these
store locators?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.800
Download the library from the
website, use several examples

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.190
and demos including the two that
I showed you today, and

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.360
refer to the detailed
documentation.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.840
All you have to do is
click here to start.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.090
Thanks for listening.
