00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.167
- [Woman] I'd like to have your response

00:00:02.167 --> 00:00:05.613
on what seems to be

00:00:05.613 --> 00:00:09.700
a changing in our history

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.331
with so many statues

00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:15.270
being removed and taken out of view

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:18.200
and it's like we want to disassociate

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.880
ourself with all of this history.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.777
And yet, that's part of our history

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:24.410
whether we like it or not

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.691
that's been there

00:00:25.691 --> 00:00:27.878
and I would like to have your

00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:29.588
thoughts on it.

00:00:29.588 --> 00:00:30.912
- I mean obviously,

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:33.828
that is a very controversial topic today.

00:00:33.828 --> 00:00:35.900
My view about it

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.753
is that it seems

00:00:38.753 --> 00:00:41.183
entirely justifiable

00:00:41.183 --> 00:00:43.880
to me that statues

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.321
which quite obviously

00:00:46.321 --> 00:00:49.657
would give offense to particular

00:00:49.657 --> 00:00:53.759
communities should not
stand without context.

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.589
So what I mean by that

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.389
is that statues for example,

00:00:59.389 --> 00:01:01.421
of the kind in the South

00:01:01.421 --> 00:01:02.798
that we've been talking about

00:01:02.798 --> 00:01:04.769
I understand why some of these statues

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.040
would be removed.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.146
But I wouldn't wish to see them destroyed.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:10.887
I would wish to see them put

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:13.259
into some kind of environment

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:14.843
that provides context

00:01:14.843 --> 00:01:17.355
that recognizes that they are part

00:01:17.355 --> 00:01:19.291
of the history of the United States.

00:01:19.291 --> 00:01:22.632
Because the controversy

00:01:22.632 --> 00:01:25.848
is not something that is just from today

00:01:25.848 --> 00:01:28.216
these are things

00:01:28.216 --> 00:01:30.578
which have been controversial

00:01:30.578 --> 00:01:32.852
and are born out of controversy

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:34.404
throughout the entire history

00:01:34.404 --> 00:01:36.285
of the United States very often.

00:01:36.285 --> 00:01:38.946
So, in some ways, maybe my response

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:42.628
is precisely that of a historian

00:01:42.628 --> 00:01:45.395
that we don't want to wipe these things

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:46.520
from the record

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:47.993
but we need to understand

00:01:47.993 --> 00:01:50.449
them in the context of history

00:01:50.449 --> 00:01:52.048
to contextualize them.

00:01:52.048 --> 00:01:53.950
Because I think ultimately

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.776
by contextualizing them

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:58.746
we understand them and then we are able,

00:01:58.746 --> 00:02:01.947
as a society, we are able to move forward.
