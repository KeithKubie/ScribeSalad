of the National Book Festival.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.370
First a word of thanks to the
Co-Chairman of the festival,

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:15.950

We'll have some time after this
presentation for questions.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:28.990

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.170
I'm happy to introduce you today
young adult fiction author,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.590
David Levithan.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.300
David has been a pioneer
in expanding the role

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.160
of gay characters
in teen literature.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.850
His first novel, <i>Boy Meets Boy</i>
, started as a story he wrote

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.270
for friends for Valentine's Day.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.420
His other acclaimed
fiction includes <i>Every Day,</i>

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.710
<i>Another Day, </i>and
<i>Two Boys Kissing.</i>

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.480
His best-selling
collaborations include <i>Nick</i>

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.920
<i>and Norah's Infinite Playlist</i>
written with Rachel Cohn,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.880
and <i>Will Grayson, Will Grayson</i>
written with John Green.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.670
His latest novel is <i>Sam</i>

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.730
<i>and Ilsa's Last Hurrah </i>also
written with Rachel Cohn.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.280
In 2016, David was
named the recipient

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.260
of the Margaret A. Edward's
Award for his contribution

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.330
to young adult literature.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.200
His forthcoming book for
young adults is <i>Someday.</i>

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.770
When not writing during
spare hours on weekends,

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.370
Levithan is Editorial
Director at Scholastic

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.940
and the founding editor of The
Push and Print which is devoted

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.370
to finding new voices and new
authors in teen literature.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.170
And here he is.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.230
[ Applause ]

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.530
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
Hello, everybody.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.830
All right.

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.130
So, first things first.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.700
So, I apologize if you've
never seen me speak before,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.400
this is Ninja.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.880
He always takes a
picture with the audience.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.180
It's good.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.480
My family is sitting
in the front

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.780
so they'll get to
be in the picture.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.080
All right.

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.380
Don't try to upstage Ninja.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.680
That always goes badly.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.980
All right.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.670
And we'll do this, okay.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.070
Now the business is
done, we can begin.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.700
So, thank you for
coming out here

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.360
to hear me talk for
a little bit.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.930
I like the Q &amp; A part
better than just me talking,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.030
so I'll try to get through
this part fairly quickly

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.980
and hopefully you guys will be
thinking of lots of Qs for me

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.990
to A, or else it will be
horribly awkward for us all.

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:45.200
I'm going to talk very
briefly about collaboration.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.420
Of the many things I do as
a writer and as an editor,

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.930
collaboration is really one

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.760
of the things I love
to do the most.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.800
And the two new books that
I have are collaborations

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.930
in very different ways.

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.860
Man, I was so excited
that I wasn't up there,

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.020
and now there's just
me gesturing behind me.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:11.740
So my most recent book
that is actually out

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.790
and in stores is <i>Sam
and Ilsa's Last Hurrah.</i>

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.600
It is a book -- the fifth book
that I wrote with Rachel Cohn.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.020
And just very briefly,
how Rachel

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.040
and I do it is we come
up with a premise.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.200
So for this one it was
toxic dinner party.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.490
The idea was it's twins, Sam
and Ilsa, brother and sister,

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.670
they are about to
graduate from high school

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.520
and they are having
their last dinner party

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.210
and they're each allowed
to invite three people,

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.890
but the other one is not
allowed to know who is coming.

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:42.630
So, you can imagine this set

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.930
up is exactly how it
was writing the book.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.700
That Rachel had her character

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.010
and she was inviting her three
characters that I didn't know

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.950
about and I had my character
and I was inviting three people

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.490
that Rachel didn't know about.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.760
We never plot out our
books ahead of time.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.430
We live them alongside
the characters.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.450
Whatever happens just happens

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.140
and we pass chapters
back and forth.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.810
So, for this one I would write a
Sam chapter, email it to Rachel.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:13.440
She'd write an Ilsa
chapter, email it back to me.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.880
We never talk about it.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.660
We never can sort of
say, why did you do that?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.960
Let's change it.

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.530
We just run with whatever
the other person does.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.210
We are such good friends
and have collaborated,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.740
again for five books now, that
we know each other's tricks

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.820
and so now we're trying to
do tricks on top of tricks.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.700
So -- so I just wanted to
give you an illustration

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.000
of how this works.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.550
So, the first passage, I'm
sure much to Rachel's chagrin,

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.010
I'm going to read
is from her chapter.

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:44.620
So this is her first chapter

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.090
and this is her introducing
the people who are going

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.490
to be attending as
Ilsa's guests.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.730
One of them it's this.

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.290
Frederick Polanski, aka
Freddy, the wildcard.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.900
He's an exchange student from
Poland living with a family

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.460
on the upper eastside.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.620
I met him when I was with my
best friend watching hot guys

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.640
play basketball in Central Park.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.810
Tall, blonde, muscled, deep
blue eyes, uncomplicated.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.000
I'm pretty sure Freckle
-- Franky's --

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.520
sorry, Freddy's the guy
I've been looking for,

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.430
the one who will break
my brother's heart.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.730
All right.

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:22.990
Challenge laid down.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.910
So I'm giving -- I'm given
this character and then I have

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.010
to then introduce
this character.

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.850
So, think about the
paragraph that Rachel --

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.330
that's all we know about Freddy.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.010
So, what are the obvious
ways to go with that?

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.930
Where would you run with that?

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.620
Now, you will get the answer
to where I ran with this.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:46.410
So this is two chapters later,
or three chapters later.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:47.710
The doorbell rings.

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.960
I figure it's going to be Jason,
but when I open the door --

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.290
there's no light up
here for me to read by.

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:56.590
It's really amusing.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.930
I find someone who is
not even remotely Jason.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.640
On the hotness scale, Jason
may have been a firecracker,

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.900
but this guy is the sun.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.970
He is wearing clothes, but
my body reacts like he isn't.

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:15.840
My gaze rises from his strong
shoulders to focus on his face.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.140
Hello, I say.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:21.050
And it sounds like hell
because the O comes out too low.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.350
So I did it wrong.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:23.760
It's Hell-oh.

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.710
I see he has one of our
invitations in his hand.

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.730
This has to be one
of Ilsa's guests.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.720
Then his other hand
gets my attention

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.370
because it has a sock on it.

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.710
A white tube sock with
green button eyes,

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.280
and a red marker mouth.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.400
And brown yarn hair.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.780
I hope we're in the right
place, the sock says.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:56.510
It has a disturbingly
attractive voice,

00:06:56.510 --> 00:07:01.730
English as a second language
with sexy-beast being the first.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.680
Excuse me?

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.020
I say. Because nine out of 10
times when you're confronted

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.570
with a sock puppet that is
the only valid response.

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:16.140
This is Ilsa's party, isn't
it, the sock continues.

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:21.810
I look up at the godlike guy
and his lips aren't moving.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.300
It is Ilsa's party, I say.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.060
I am not talking to the hand.

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:29.920
I am talking to the hot
guy who is looking at me

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.350
like his hand isn't
talking to me.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:34.820
I'm her brother, Sam.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:37.750
Nice to meet you, the sock says.

00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:44.440
It holds out its hand which
is his pinky under a sock.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:48.260
I look at the guy as if to
say, you can't be serious.

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.760
And he looks back at me as if
to say, this is my life choice

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:55.090
and you must respect it.

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:58.320
I shake the sock's hand-pinky.

00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.750
I'm Caspian, it says.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.050
This is Frederick.

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:04.350
He met Ilsa when he
was playing basketball.

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:06.490
I'm not allowed to
accompany him on the court

00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:08.460
so I missed the chance
to meet her.

00:08:08.460 --> 00:08:11.170
But I'm very happy
to meet you now.

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.550
Come in, I say.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:19.510
Please. Collaboration,
isn't it great?

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:25.040
[ Applause ]

00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.680
So that is how we work.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.490
If she sends me a hot
guy, I add a sock puppet.

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:32.790
And vice-versa.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.300
And really, the joy of
writing with somebody else is

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.730
that you are living the
story alongside them

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:39.250
and you don't know
where it's going to go.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:42.730
And you're kind of,
in a way, as oblivious

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.020
as your characters are.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.610
As with <i>Nick and Norah's
Infinite Playlist </i>,

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.040
our first book together, and
all the ones that have come

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.880
after it is about the adventure
of meeting people and sort

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:53.180
of trying to navigate life

00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.400
through the people
you connect with.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:58.330
So, the other book, and this
is the first time I'm talking

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:02.890
about it with it coming out in a
month and a day, is <i>Someday </i>,

00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:06.230
which is the third book in sort
of the sequence that started

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.570
with my book <i>Every Day</i>
which was turned into a movie

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:10.420
that was released this spring.

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:13.690
So, I wrote <i>Every Day </i>.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.480
It is, if you're not familiar
with it, shame on you.

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.770
No, if you are not familiar with
it, it's about somebody named A

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.920
who changes bodies every
day and lives every day.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:26.760
And lives like this
-- has been like this

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.750
since birth, and
lives like this.

00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:30.450
Not really connecting to anybody

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:36.460
until in their 16th year they
meet somebody named Rhiannon

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:37.760
and fall in love.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:39.060
And not just fall in love,

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.660
but connect with somebody
for the first time.

00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.130
And so, the book <i>Every
Day </i>is about identity.

00:09:44.130 --> 00:09:45.440
It's about who would you be

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:48.020
if you weren't defined
by your body?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.740
If you weren't seen and
defined by gender, by race,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.170
by parentage, by
any outward feature.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:57.430
If you were just yourself.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.730
Whatever that is.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:02.970
Often we find there's a
disconnect to who we feel we are

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:05.530
and what our body looks
like, and especially

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:08.570
to how it is interpreted by
other people looking at us.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:11.260
And so I wanted to talk about
that and write about somebody

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:16.560
who was purely a self and
how they navigate life.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.040
I was that -- I did not think
I would write necessarily more,

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:24.700
but in writing that story I was
curious about Rhiannon's point

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.560
of view and my book, <i>Another
Day </i>, is from her point of view

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.020
with the same circumstances.

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.620
And that book is about love.

00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:35.650
And it is about if you say,
oh, I love the you inside,

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:38.660
it doesn't matter
what you look like.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.090
Is that true?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:41.680
And we say, Love conquers all,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.260
but society does give us certain
pressures and can love conquer

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:48.010
that and how do you
navigate that?

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:49.600
So that's what <i>Another
Day </i>is about.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.590
So this book, <i>Some Day, </i>this
is the Australian edition,

00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:54.540
but it's the same cover, so
at least it gives you a sense

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.650
of what it will look like when
it comes out on October 2nd,

00:10:57.650 --> 00:11:00.800
is the culmination
of all these strands.

00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.570
In <i>Every Day, </i>it is not
giving away too much to say

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.530
that we meet somebody who in
<i>Every Day </i>is in the body

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.290
of a reverend named
Reverend Poole.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:12.730
But it is somebody, who
like A, can change bodies.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.000
Not necessarily every day, but
just jumps from body to body.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.690
And what this third
book is about is

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.070
about choices and moral choices.

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:23.150
And the fact that
we can get away

00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.550
with something doesn't mean
we should necessarily do it.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:31.220
So, if A is very, what I would
call moral in that when A is

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:34.140
in a body, A does not
want to steer it astray.

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:35.880
Does not want to
take advantage of it.

00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.500
Does not want to do anything.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:43.040
The character, who we will call
X, inside Reverend Poole's body

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.030
in the first book and
in many different bodies

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:47.310
in this new book,
is the opposite.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.220
It's like hey, nobody
can catch me.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.520
I can get away with anything.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.510
I can manipulate
whatever I want.

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:56.880
I can choose who to be
and I want to be powerful

00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.480
and I want to be privileged.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.220
And that creates some
conflict to say the least.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:06.570
It is about these two
world views colliding

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:08.510
and trying to navigate that.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:13.850
It is told from at least -- I'll
say at least four perspectives.

00:12:13.850 --> 00:12:17.090
Part of the hopefully
interesting part

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.190
of the book is you never
quite know who is going

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.240
to be narrating the
next chapter.

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:24.680
But it really is told from
Rhiannon's point of view,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.460
Nathan who is in the first
book and in the second book, A,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:31.970
and then this character, X. so
just to dip into a little bit

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.470
of evil, I will read a
little bit from X's portion

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:40.310
and then a little
bit from A's portion.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.360
So, this is X. To
stay in a body,

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.270
you must take that body over.

00:12:47.270 --> 00:12:51.640
To take a body over, you
must kill the person inside.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.800
It is not an easy thing to
do to assert your own self

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.720
over the will that
exists in the body.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.360
To smother it until
it is no longer there.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.910
But it can be done.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:07.480
Not a person you'd
want inside your body.

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:10.960
Meanwhile, A -- it's hard
to talk about this book

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:14.920
without giving the ending
of the other book away,

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.090
but A is a little bit
lost and is thinking

00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:21.620
that A can be separate
again, but is not and says,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.720
Life is harder when you
have someone to miss.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.470
I wake up in a suburb of Denver
and feel like I am living

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.790
in a suburb of my own life.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:32.420
The alarm goes off
and I want to sleep,

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:35.720
but I have a responsibility,
an obligation.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.100
So I get out of bed.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:39.190
I figure out I'm in
the body and the life

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:40.810
of a girl named Danielle.

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:42.220
I get dressed.

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:46.230
I try to avoid imagining what
Rhiannon is doing two hours

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:47.530
time difference.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.330
Two hours and a world away.

00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:53.320
As you can imagine, if this
book is to have a plot,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.590
A does not stay far
away for very long.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.610
And so, I did say this
is a collaboration

00:13:58.610 --> 00:14:00.090
and it was interesting
because there --

00:14:00.090 --> 00:14:04.620
there have been eight years
since I wrote the first book.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:06.370
And there was a movie
that came out.

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:07.960
And it was really
interesting to see

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:11.890
that this book is very much
a response to many things.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:15.410
I'm collaborating with myself
in that I laid something down

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.580
and now I'm pulling
from it again.

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.640
I'm collaborating with a
different interpretation.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.730
I loved the movie version
of <i>Every Day </i>unabashedly.

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.400
And I -- there are parts of it

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.580
that I think actually
improved the book

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:28.130
that I wish I had
put in the book.

00:14:28.130 --> 00:14:31.120
And so it was interesting
to have that tone

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.890
and have those actors in
my mind as I was writing,

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:35.810
or finishing up this book.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:38.630
But also it was I've had
so many conversations

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.530
about <i>Every Day</i>
and about the fact

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:43.460
that we shouldn't be
defined by our bodies.

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:46.630
That gender is absolutely
not binary

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:49.580
and that you should be able to
choose whatever gender you want.

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:54.120
And about the fact that we
often times subjugate our own

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:57.620
definitions of self because
of the way other people see us

00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.380
and how we have to
fight back against that

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.290
on many different levels.

00:15:01.290 --> 00:15:04.470
And so, all of that, as well as
the current political climate

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.030
where making moral choices is
more important now than ever,

00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:11.420
that all came into this book
which is why it's longer

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:13.020
than the other two books.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:17.720
So, as promised that it
-- that's my overview.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.730
Now is the awkward
period where I'm like oh,

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.950
let's open up to questions and
nobody necessarily has gotten

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.810
to the mics yet, people
might be hesitant.

00:15:24.810 --> 00:15:27.910
It's great because I'm blind
right now, so I can't even tell

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:29.290
if there's somebody at the mics.

00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:32.670
And so if it looks like
I'm gauzily out there,

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.970
is there anybody at the -- okay.

00:15:33.970 --> 00:15:35.270
People are going.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:36.570
That's good.

00:15:36.570 --> 00:15:37.870
That's promising.

00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:39.170
I can see people moving.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:40.470
There's movement.

00:15:40.470 --> 00:15:41.770
That's awesome.

00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:43.070
So, yeah. Usually it's
awkward, nobody wants

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.370
to ask the first question and --

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:45.670
&gt;&gt; Are there two mics?

00:15:45.670 --> 00:15:46.970
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
Are there two mics?

00:15:46.970 --> 00:15:48.270
All right.

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.570
So we're going to try to get

00:15:49.570 --> 00:15:50.870
through as many questions
as possible.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.170
There is nothing worse
than the author who's like,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.470
I love questions,
then gets one question

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.770
and gives a 20 minute answer.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:57.200
So, we are going to start
with the blur over here.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:58.500
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.800
I'll keep it nice and objective.

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.100
How many drafts do
you usually go

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:04.510
for before you send a
book off to publishers?

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.030
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
I'm actually --

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.580
my writing process is very crazy
in that I will write and rewrite

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.000
and rewrite and rewrite
the first three chapters

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.350
because I need the
foundation for my book.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:18.790
So I -- that -- those chapters
will go through 20 drafts

00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:22.750
at least, but then once I get
momentum and once I'm moving,

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:25.170
with this -- with the
latest book, <i>Some Day,</i>

00:16:25.170 --> 00:16:28.050
MI'd read the first three
chapters about 20 times.

00:16:28.050 --> 00:16:31.550
I'd read the first
half of the book twice.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:35.260
And then I'd only actually
read over the entirety

00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:37.970
of the book once before
I sent it to my editor.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.760
And I do send it to my editor
fairly early in the process

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.510
because I want to have
that conversation with her.

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:47.900
But usually for me it is focus
on what you want this book

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:50.860
to be, who the characters are,
what it's going to sound like,

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:55.270
and then once you've fixed that
into place then just run with it

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.930
and don't go back and
don't draft and redraft

00:16:57.930 --> 00:17:00.210
until you have something
that's done.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.510
But that's just me.

00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:02.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:04.110
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: All right.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.410
Over here.

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.710
&gt;&gt; I was wondering if you could
speak about how much influence,

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:08.750
or like if you had any
say in like production

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:10.540
and stuff for the movie.

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.730
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I had no --

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:15.250
nothing whatsoever
to do with the movie.

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:17.110
I was extraordinarily lucky

00:17:17.110 --> 00:17:19.740
because they actually
hired Jessie Andrews,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:22.210
who is an amazing
Y-author in his own right,

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:23.510
to write the screenplay.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:24.810
So I was like, cool.

00:17:24.810 --> 00:17:26.370
Ask my friend to
write the screenplay.

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:27.820
That works well.

00:17:27.820 --> 00:17:29.260
And he just knew the rhythms.

00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.940
His -- both his book and his
movie adaptation of his own book

00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:34.770
for <i>Me and Earl and
the Dying Girl </i>is one

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:36.520
of my favorite movies
of all time and one

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.830
of the best adaptations
I've ever seen.

00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.460
So I was like if he could
actually adapt his own book,

00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:43.510
he could do it for me.

00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:47.530
But really I let them do
what they wanted to do.

00:17:47.530 --> 00:17:49.320
I did get to sort
of talk to him,

00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:50.620
and there were a few things.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.920
He's like how about this?

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.260
And I was like I
don't know about that.

00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:57.780
And I did get to see a rough cut
of the movie and give comments.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.740
And there was one thing
that was in the movie

00:17:59.740 --> 00:18:01.450
that I didn't want
to be in there.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:04.950
And they actually did take
it out, so that's the extent

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:06.250
of the involvement that I had.

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:09.050
But most of the time
I'm of the --

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:11.660
the mind that the exciting
part is you're giving the story

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:13.930
to somebody else and
seeing what they do with it.

00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.230
And so far, I've been lucky

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.620
that every adaptation I've
had has brought something new

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.950
to it that I've liked.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:20.250
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:21.550
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thank you.

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:22.850
All right.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.150
Over here.

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:25.450
&gt;&gt; Hello.

00:18:25.450 --> 00:18:26.750
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Hi.

00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:28.540
&gt;&gt; What gave you the original
idea for like A, like this being

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.420
that doesn't have any gender
or any binary-ness, I guess?

00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:34.720
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Yes.

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.950
I would love -- somebody
once asked that question

00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:40.210
in the form of, is this
based on your real life?

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.370
And I was like, No.

00:18:42.370 --> 00:18:44.110
No. It is not.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.150
So -- so it's not
autobiographical.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:50.180
But no, really, I wish there
was a better origin story.

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:52.520
Other books of mine have so
much better origin stories.

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.230
But this one, I was just
walking to work one day,

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:56.970
feeling whatever I was
feeling about my own body,

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.270
and I thought woah,
what would it be

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.990
like to switch bodies every day.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:01.960
What would you --
who would you be

00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.890
if you were never
in one set body?

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:05.190
And it was just that --

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:08.960
that thought and that
premise that A was born from.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.830
I did not understand any
of the implications of what

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.070
that would mean for A until
I started writing the book.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:18.090
And really, I wrote the
book to answer the question

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:20.710
of who would you be if you
weren't defined by your body?

00:19:20.710 --> 00:19:23.280
But the spark was
just that premise.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:25.740
That question to
myself of what --

00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:29.100
what would life be like if
you weren't judging me based

00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:31.810
on what you're seeing right now.

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:33.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.410
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thanks.

00:19:34.410 --> 00:19:35.710
Over there.

00:19:35.710 --> 00:19:37.490
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I am a special
education literacy teacher

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:39.590
at a middle school here in DC.

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:40.890
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Awesome.

00:19:40.890 --> 00:19:43.940
&gt;&gt; And I'm constantly
just -- like so grateful.

00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.680
Even as a young teacher I've
seen the growth from when I was

00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:50.200
in middle school to now in
how much diversity there is

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:52.940
in the books that are easily
accessible to my kids.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.240
So my question there is really,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:57.080
what areas do you think
we've done a really great job

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.640
in expanding the
kinds of characters?

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.940
And why A?

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.300
And what areas do you still
see the biggest gaps in?

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.600
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Oh.

00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:06.750
I mean, I think there's still
so much work to be done,

00:20:06.750 --> 00:20:09.280
although it is incredible
to see how far we've come.

00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.480
If you, I'm sure look at
the schedule for the first

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.510
of these festivals and
the schedule for now,

00:20:15.510 --> 00:20:18.900
you will see a much
wider, more diverse range

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.300
because that's what
publishing has done.

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:21.750
That's not about the festival.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.470
It's about publishing
in general.

00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:25.500
I think really, it's
about intersectionality.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:29.230
It is about talking about
all the different experiences

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.530
within one group.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:33.270
So, yes, it is great we
have so many queer novels,

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:35.950
but so many of those
queer novels still are

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.080
about white, middleclass Simons.

00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.720
And I love white, middleclass
Simons, and let's face it,

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:46.630
in the movie, Simon's
actually upper-class, but --

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:48.380
but -- which is great.

00:20:48.380 --> 00:20:49.970
I mean I was one of those boys.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.740
Like absolutely, but we
actually absolutely have to see

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.800
so many other experiences
that are queer experiences.

00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:00.570
And there are so many
exciting writers right now

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:03.680
who are writing into that space.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.920
At Scholastic, it's
not a book I edited,

00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.970
but we published a book
called <i>Hurricane Child,</i>

00:21:07.970 --> 00:21:11.350
Mfor middle grade, that is
this amazing queer novel

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:15.130
by Kheryn Callender who has
a YA coming out this fall.

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.680
And just there're all these new
writers and new voices coming

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.320
out that I think are
going to continue to say,

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.170
there is no such thing
as one queer identity,

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.550
or one black identity, or one --

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:27.840
just any, any identity
you choose,

00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.100
there are so many
different perspectives

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.790
within that identity and we have
to publish and reflect as many

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.260
of those experiences as we can.

00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.560
So, thanks.

00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:38.860
All right.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.160
Over here.

00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.460
&gt;&gt; Hi. I just wanted to say

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.850
that I really loved
<i>Realm of Possibility </i>--

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:44.150
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
Oh, thank you.

00:21:44.150 --> 00:21:46.720
&gt;&gt; -- and I was wondering
kind of how you managed

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:50.890
to get all those characters that
were so interesting and how you

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.010
like figured out how they
each kind of were written?

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:56.650
Because they had like prose and
it was different and I loved it.

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.950
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you.

00:21:57.950 --> 00:21:59.250
So, <i>Realm of Possibility</i>
was my second book.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:01.700
It is my only book that
is entirely in poetry.

00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.840
Including some prose pawns,
but it is told from the point

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.840
of view of 20 different kids who
all go to the same high school.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.120
And that, honestly, I just made
it up as I went along and played

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:13.420
with the different characters

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.150
and didn't start piecing
together how they were connected

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:17.450
until about halfway through.

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:19.320
I just wanted to see which
voices would come up.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.150
And the poetry forms really
led me very well to the voices.

00:22:24.150 --> 00:22:25.940
I started that, honestly,

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.560
because as an editor I
was editing different

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:30.860
poetry memoirs.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.850
A book by my best
friend, Billy Merrell,

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.300
called <i>Talking in the Dark.</i>

00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.760
A book called <i>You Remind Me
of You </i>by Eireann Corrigan

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:39.290
for the Push and Print
that Sydney mentioned.

00:22:39.290 --> 00:22:43.320
And so, I was so drenched in
poetry as a reader and an editor

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.790
that just it started to
express itself in my work.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.580
And also it was my second book
and I'd written this really

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.060
to be happier, romantic comedy

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:54.870
about two gay boys
called <i>Boy Meets Boy.</i>

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:58.840
And so I wanted my second book
to be as different from that

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:01.080
in form as possible
just to prove

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.950
that I could write
different things.

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:07.340
And so writing 20 different
voices in verse was how it went.

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.640
But really, for me, my writing,

00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.830
mine works by just
seeing what comes out

00:23:12.830 --> 00:23:14.660
and then forming it
rather than thinking

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:15.960
about it and planning it out.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.950
So for that one the
voices just came to me

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:20.340
and I figured out
how they fit in.

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.640
But I'm so glad --

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.940
&gt;&gt; Awesome, thank you.

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:24.240
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thanks.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.540
All right.

00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:26.840
Over there.

00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.140
&gt;&gt; Hi. One of the books of yours

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:29.440
that I really loved was
<i>Will Grayson, Will Grayson.</i>

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:30.740
And I was -- and
that meant a lot --

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.380
that book meant a lot to me,
so I was kind of just wondering

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:35.020
like what the core of
that story was to you.

00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:36.640
Like if you had to sum it up,

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.940
what do you think was the
most important part of it?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.240
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I mean --

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.650
I mean it's called <i>Will
Grayson, Will Grayson.</i>

00:23:42.650 --> 00:23:43.950
If you've not read it,

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.250
it's about two boys
with the same name.

00:23:45.250 --> 00:23:47.700
One of them was written
by John Green, one by me.

00:23:47.700 --> 00:23:51.860
And I think because it was based
on the fact that when I was

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.610
in college, there
was a kid walking

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:54.910
around named David Levinthall

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:56.310
and we would be mistaken
for each other.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:24:00.390
And so I always thought
that was interesting zoom

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:03.510
into your own identity when
there is somebody who is

00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:04.970
like you, even in something

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:06.930
as superficial as
your name, around.

00:24:06.930 --> 00:24:09.470
And so, John and I really
wanted to explore that.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.550
And about sort of
what makes you tick.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:13.700
For my Will Grayson,
it's very much

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.460
about making it through
the middle.

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:21.710
That he knows he's gay, but he
doesn't really feel he needs

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.450
to like come out in a huge way.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.100
So he's okay with it, but
he just doesn't want anyone

00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:27.680
to bother him about it.

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.840
He is dealing with his
depression and is on medication

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:33.590
and it's working, but it
is something he still has

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:34.890
to navigate.

00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:36.620
But it's not about
him finding out.

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.360
It's about him navigating.

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.540
So, for me it's about
that state.

00:24:41.540 --> 00:24:44.580
It's about when you know what's
going on and you're managing,

00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.450
and you're dealing with it,
and you're getting through it.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:48.850
And you meet the people
you need to meet in order

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.160
to help you get through it.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.460
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.760
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thank you.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:54.530
&gt;&gt; Hi. I wondered if
you could talk more

00:24:54.530 --> 00:24:56.550
about gender in your writing.

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:00.490
I know you said <i>Every Day</i>
was not an autobiographical,

00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.550
but you still had to write
a lot of different genders.

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.630
And I noticed in <i>Sam
and Ilsa's Last Hurrah,</i>

00:25:07.630 --> 00:25:10.670
Myou're writing Sam who's a boy.

00:25:10.670 --> 00:25:13.270
So how would you --
or I assume is a boy.

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.300
So, how would you
write someone --

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:17.450
do you have a lot of
experience with writing people

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:20.570
of different genders and how
do you manage writing people

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.090
of different genders and
like figuring that out

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.200
when it's a different
experience than yours?

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.880
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I
mean, I think it is --

00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:29.820
I mean there are
three answers here.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.650
I mean, certainly writing from
the point of view of a gay male,

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:37.760
that is who I am, so
that's easy to do.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.560
Pieces of me come in,
but pieces of me come

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:41.860
in in the other ways too.

00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:43.160
With A, it's writing
about somebody

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.910
who isn't defined by gender.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:46.970
And who's never been
defined by gender.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:50.370
And that, obviously you need
that supernatural conceit

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.670
to get to that person.

00:25:51.670 --> 00:25:55.200
And that really was thinking
a lot about non-binary.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:58.030
Thinking a lot about
trans issues and talking

00:25:58.030 --> 00:26:00.030
to my friends who
identify as both.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:04.220
And also just again, thinking
theoretically about it as well.

00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.900
When I do write from a female
point of view, like Rhiannon

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:10.010
from <i>Another Day, </i>or sometimes
with the books with Rachel,

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:11.890
we will take each
other's characters.

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.130
So in <i>Naomi and Ely's
No Kiss List, </i>Naomi.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:18.100
Again, I feel that hopefully
I've been paying enough

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.660
attention to the
females in my life

00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:23.590
that I understand a little
bit where they're coming from.

00:26:23.590 --> 00:26:26.760
But I'm also very
confident in that I know

00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.710
that my female editor or
my female co-author will,

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:32.400
if I get something
wrong, tell me, dude,

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:33.700
you got something wrong.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:35.000
And then we will fix it.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:38.490
So, I think you absolutely
should write outside your own

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.360
voice, but you should
always do your research

00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.660
and always do it respectfully,

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:44.200
and there should always
be a reason you've chosen

00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.700
to do it that way.

00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.510
And that's, with my
writing, what I try to do.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.810
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.110
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thank you.

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:54.130
&gt;&gt; Hi. So, I know you
said that you love

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:57.340
to collaborate on
different works.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.480
Do you -- how do you choose who
you want to collaborate with,

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.180
or do they come to you?

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:03.480
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I mean, it --

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:07.160
it all happened sort of the
universe just throws it our way.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.800
With Rachel, it was she
had tried to write a novel

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:13.690
that had a he said and she
said, and she tried to do both.

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.270
And she was like, I don't --

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:16.570
I want to actually write

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:17.980
with a male writer
doing the he said part.

00:27:17.980 --> 00:27:22.140
And I was luckily the best
male writer friend she had,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:23.890
and I said yes.

00:27:23.890 --> 00:27:26.090
With John, it was just I
really loved his books.

00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:27.390
He loved my books.

00:27:27.390 --> 00:27:28.690
I was like, I have
this crazy idea.

00:27:28.690 --> 00:27:30.300
And we ran with it.

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.940
With Andrea Cremer, who I
wrote <i>Invisibility </i>with,

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.400
we were actually doing an event

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:36.550
with John the first
time we had met.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:39.730
By the 15th minute of our event
I was singing <i>You've Lost</i>

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.320
<i>That Loving Feeling</i>
to her on the stage

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.630
which is usually a good sign
that you're getting along.

00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:47.650
And that night, jokingly,
she blogged and said,

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:49.110
when is David Levithan
going to write a book --

00:27:49.110 --> 00:27:51.930
whatever, with me about
something supernatural?

00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.390
And I was like Aha!

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.230
And I wrote the first chapter
of a book about an invisible boy

00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.620
and emailed it to her
out of the blue being

00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.350
like all right, gauntlet thrown.

00:28:01.350 --> 00:28:03.010
You're on.

00:28:03.010 --> 00:28:04.700
And so that's how that happened.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.370
Don't -- don't go
home and blog now.

00:28:07.370 --> 00:28:09.480
That -- that's been done.

00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.220
But yeah, it's just random
things bring people together.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.800
Nina Lacour, who I wrote
<i>You Know Me Well </i>with,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:17.920
deliberately we were
saying how we don't

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.140
like how queer books
are often separated

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:23.570
into like the lesbian section
and the gay boy section.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.900
It's much more nuanced
and complicated than that.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.150
And so, I was like let's write
a back and forth about --

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:32.500
about a lesbian girl and a
gay boy, obviously not falling

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.910
in love with each other,

00:28:34.910 --> 00:28:37.930
and like let's play
around with this.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.740
Let's do a romantic comedy where
the two leads are not going

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:44.080
to end up together for very good
reasons and really write a book

00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.460
that is as queer as it can be

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.380
from as many queer
perspectives as possible.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.080
So sometimes there's
a reason for that too.

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.380
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.680
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thank you.

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.980
Yes.

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:56.280
&gt;&gt; Okay, so I have
two questions.

00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:58.580
Do you want one that's
slightly less complicated,

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:00.210
or a complicated one?

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.510
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: We
have little time left,

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.100
so let's go for the
slightly less complicated.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:06.630
&gt;&gt; Do you have any advice
for young writers who want

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:10.160
to write more diverse than
what they usually read?

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.360
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I mean,
I think it is try to have

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.740
as diverse a life
as possible and draw

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:17.430
from as many experiences
as you can get.

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.850
That -- that nobody is
going to write effectively

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:22.640
from other points of view if
they only know people who are

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.530
like themselves and only
interact with people

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:25.830
who are like themselves.

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.310
And you have to be
out in the world

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:29.750
and pay attention respectfully.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.900
You're not meeting people just
so you can use their stories.

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.340
You are meeting people hopefully
to understand their stories more

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:37.650
and share that experience more.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:42.350
And so I think it is just
challenging yourself and to push

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:46.090
and also to find the
things you have in common.

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:49.730
It is always -- I can find
something massively in common

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:52.830
with a character who
changes bodies every day

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:56.250
because I also have feelings
of why am I being defined

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:57.550
by who I am on the outside?

00:29:57.550 --> 00:30:00.370
Why am I not being seen
by who I am on the inside?

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.570
So that's somebody I'm not, but
it's somebody I can connect to.

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.900
And I think to effectively
write, you always have

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.670
to have a connection
to the characters.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:10.700
Whether it is through your
own experience or it is

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.170
through people that
you know and love.

00:30:13.170 --> 00:30:15.260
So that -- that would
be my advice.

00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:16.560
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:17.860
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Thank you.

00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.160
All right.

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.460
Over here.

00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:21.760
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.060
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Hello.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:24.360
&gt;&gt; I'm a little too
short for the mic,

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.660
so I'm going to have to tip-toe.

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.960
But I'm a second-year student
and I go to school here in DC

00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.480
and I'm taking this
class on writing culture.

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:32.500
And my professor discussed this
book called <i>And Tango Makes</i>

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.730
<i>Three, </i>which is a
children's picture book.

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:38.620
It's about two gay penguins
and they adopt an egg.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:39.920
It's really cute.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.220
Everyone should read it.

00:30:41.220 --> 00:30:43.950
But -- but then we were
discussing this idea

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.580
of censorship, and agency, and
morality, and like who gets

00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:52.180
to have their say in what
gets to be put in bookshelves

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:54.980
in our classes, in
our libraries,

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.280
you know, and all of that.

00:30:56.280 --> 00:31:00.140
So, how do you respond to that
as a writer because I know some

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:04.470
of your books have been
on the challenged booklist

00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:06.040
and what does that
make you feel?

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.760
Or like what do you think
is the purpose of libraries?

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.280
Like should they be
acting as moral compasses

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.430
or like is it just enough
for them to just be a place

00:31:17.430 --> 00:31:19.580
of like information
dissemination?

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:20.880
I'm sorry, that was a lot.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:22.180
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: No, no.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.520
I mean, I think --
I think a library

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.370
and a school library
always have responsibilities

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.960
to reflect the world
and everybody in it.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.510
And that's every
viewpoint, everybody in it.

00:31:31.510 --> 00:31:35.910
And we certainly can
discuss what is in there,

00:31:35.910 --> 00:31:38.780
but they have a moral obligation

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.470
to really represent
both the people who are

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:42.820
in their communities,
but also people

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.130
who are not in their
communities.

00:31:44.130 --> 00:31:47.790
And so, I think that
<i>Tango Makes Three </i>is a

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:49.090
great example.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:52.030
Where it is about, it's a true
story of these two male penguins

00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:55.100
who raised this baby
penguin, but it has been

00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.820
on the banned books list on
and off for about 20 years.

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:01.620
And it is the classic case,
as with most censorship,

00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:04.740
where the people attacking the
book are really attacking the

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:06.040
thing behind the book.

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.740
In this case, the fact that we
gay people exist in the world.

00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.980
And they are under the
misbegotten belief, A,

00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.570
that if they get
rid of the book,

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.440
suddenly we'll just go away.

00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:19.950
But then also the fact
that if they attack a book,

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:21.320
a book can't defend itself.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:27.150
The really great
news is that 97 times

00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:31.020
out of 100 the book does defend
itself and stays on the shelves.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:35.730
That although we do have a
culture of book challenges here

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.030
in America that is unlike
anywhere else in the world,

00:32:38.030 --> 00:32:41.950
we also have a massive success
rate of people defending books.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:44.200
So if you think that
by taking that book

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.340
about the gay penguins
off the shelves,

00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:48.230
the community will
just ignore the fact

00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:49.770
that there are gay
people around,

00:32:49.770 --> 00:32:51.650
instead it actually
causes people

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:54.110
to defend the book,
defend the identity.

00:32:54.110 --> 00:32:56.460
And also have the conversation
that the people who tried

00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:59.060
to ban the book wanted to
avoid in the first place.

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:01.820
So, I like that the
system works that way.

00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.420
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: All right.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:05.720
We have two minutes,
so very quickly.

00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:07.020
Rapid fire.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:08.320
&gt;&gt; Okay, I'm going to
preface this by saying I tried

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.990
to get my sister to ask this
question, she didn't want to.

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:12.320
I'm being bribed to ask this.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:13.620
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Okay.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:16.190
&gt;&gt; What, in your opinion, is
the scariest sea creature?

00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.640
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
I have no idea,

00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.430
but after hearing Alex Bracken,
I'm really scared of scorpions.

00:33:23.430 --> 00:33:24.730
And that's all I can say.

00:33:24.730 --> 00:33:26.030
All right, next question.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.040
&gt;&gt; Yeah, well, this one sort
of piggybacks off of it,

00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:32.610
but what were -- when did you
get <i>Boy Meets Boy </i>published?

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.910
&gt;&gt; David Levithan:
It was 15 years ago.

00:33:33.910 --> 00:33:35.210
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah.

00:33:35.210 --> 00:33:37.160
And considering how long
ago that was, I mean,

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.330
what were the challenges of
trying to find a publisher

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:42.670
because I know even, you know,
especially back then and even

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.970
to a certain extent today,
there's a certain, you know,

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.450
a certain amount of
people who still believe

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:51.640
that LGBT stuff is adult.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:53.770
Even if there's no
actual, you know,

00:33:53.770 --> 00:33:55.070
sexual activity or anything.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.470
Even if it's just these two
people are in a relationship.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.700
So what were the challenges
of getting it published?

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:01.570
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: Well, the
good news is that almost none

00:34:01.570 --> 00:34:03.350
of those people work
for publishers.

00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:06.700
Publishers -- no,
and I work for one.

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.760
Random House was -- it was the
first queer young adult book

00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.060
that they had published.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.360
Random House Children's Book.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:14.910
But they were like gung-ho.

00:34:14.910 --> 00:34:16.260
They were like, it's about time.

00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.560
Let's do this.

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.050
And certainly there were
gay books before mine

00:34:19.050 --> 00:34:20.350
that led the way.

00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.520
There are gay books after
mine that carried it on.

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.500
We are in a beautiful continuum.

00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.780
And so, -- so I think that
you should never be hesitant

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.400
about writing for queer
identities because that --

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:34.150
those are the people who are
out there and that is the books

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.700
that publishers want to find.

00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.730
And again, want to
find as many variations

00:34:38.730 --> 00:34:40.030
of the story as possible.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.330
All right.

00:34:41.330 --> 00:34:42.630
I think we have time
for one more.

00:34:42.630 --> 00:34:43.930
Very quickly.

00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so -- I've
been like literally --

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:49.990
like I came here because I
knew you wrote <i>Boy Meets Boy,</i>

00:34:49.990 --> 00:34:51.600
Mbut I was like literally --

00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:56.600
what I was seeing reading your
stuff about like not being

00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.380
in the same body all the
time and not being defined

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.100
by your body, I was
like literally Googling

00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:05.870
like all your books
during the presentation.

00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:09.330
And then, what I
found fascinating was

00:35:09.330 --> 00:35:13.750
that <i>Every Day </i>and <i>Another
Day </i>were basically the same

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:17.600
book except written
in the point of view

00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.640
of two different characters.

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.890
Like, how did you
decide on that?

00:35:22.890 --> 00:35:26.320
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: I mean, very
quickly, it really was I felt

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:29.490
that Rhiannon's voice, although
it came out in the first book,

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.790
needed to come out more.

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:33.150
And so, it was going through
everything that had happened

00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:35.800
in the first book and just
seeing it through her eyes.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.410
And that's what I wrote down.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:38.710
&gt;&gt; Oh wow.

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:40.010
&gt;&gt; David Levithan: All right.

00:35:40.010 --> 00:35:41.900
We are now out of time,
unfortunately, but I'm signing

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:44.490
from 3:00 to 4:00
downstairs, so please come by.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:47.300
I'm happy to sign as many books
as you want and to talk to you

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.820
and answer any questions
that didn't get to be asked.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.120
Thanks.
