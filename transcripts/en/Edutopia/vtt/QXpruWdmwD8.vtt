00:00:09.046 --> 00:00:13.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At 7:00 A.M. on
a Thursday, several hundred

00:00:13.676 --> 00:00:16.546
of Seattle's movers and
shakers gather to eat breakfast

00:00:16.626 --> 00:00:19.556
and watch a unique talent show.

00:00:20.346 --> 00:00:23.546
Not your average bake sale, this
event will raise enough money

00:00:23.736 --> 00:00:26.036
in two hours to fund
many of the programs

00:00:26.036 --> 00:00:30.206
at John Stanford International
School, which recently won top honors

00:00:30.206 --> 00:00:34.566
in the Intel and Scholastic
Schools of Distinction Competition.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.046
&gt;&gt;I come from Honduras.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.366
&gt;&gt;Man: Honduras; Where are you from?

00:00:38.636 --> 00:00:39.286
&gt;&gt;Ethiopia.

00:00:39.516 --> 00:00:41.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The school
could have been honored

00:00:41.626 --> 00:00:43.426
for its multicultural perspective...

00:00:43.656 --> 00:00:44.756
&gt;&gt;I come from Mongolia.

00:00:44.906 --> 00:00:45.816
&gt;&gt;Man: Mongolia.

00:00:46.256 --> 00:00:51.516
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...or its integration
of technology, art, and music...

[ Singing ]

00:00:52.206 --> 00:00:53.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...or the
active participation

00:00:54.486 --> 00:00:55.886
of parents and community members.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:58.456
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Spanish]

00:00:58.896 --> 00:01:00.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But its main claim

00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:01.976
to fame is its language-immersion
approach to learning.

00:01:02.516 --> 00:01:06.556
&gt;&gt;Group: [Speaking Spanish]

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:09.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Students here choose a
Spanish or Japanese language track.

00:01:10.516 --> 00:01:13.726
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Japanese]

00:01:14.226 --> 00:01:16.796
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They spend half a
day studying math and science

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:17.976
in their chosen language...

00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:20.051
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Spanish]

00:01:20.086 --> 00:01:22.196
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and the other
half learning social studies

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:23.716
and language arts in English.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:25.516
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Tell me about what
happens at the beginning.

00:01:25.516 --> 00:01:26.956
Let's start at the
beginning of the folktale.

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:28.486
&gt;&gt;Karen: When we first started,

00:01:28.486 --> 00:01:31.516
we had no idea what our curriculum
should be and what we should teach

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.226
in that second language, and of
course, we thought social studies

00:01:34.226 --> 00:01:36.266
at first because that's
where all the meat is.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:37.786
We talk about cultures and things.

00:01:38.086 --> 00:01:40.246
Wrong. That's very abstract.

00:01:40.546 --> 00:01:43.626
So the idea was we took math
and science, because that's

00:01:43.626 --> 00:01:44.926
where you have a lot of the hands-on.

00:01:45.516 --> 00:01:48.596
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [Speaking Japanese]

00:01:49.096 --> 00:01:52.256
&gt;&gt;Hiromi: Research shows
math and science is easier

00:01:53.016 --> 00:01:56.906
as a second language because there
are so many hands-on activities,

00:01:57.376 --> 00:02:00.616
and we can do a lot of
project-based activities

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:03.746
so that we can integrate the
language-acquisition part

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:06.856
in the subject-content learning.

00:02:07.516 --> 00:02:09.726
&gt;&gt;Group: [Speaking Japanese]

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:13.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they
call it "yodo" or "humus,"

00:02:14.286 --> 00:02:18.026
kids at John Stanford know
what they're learning.

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.976
&gt;&gt;Claire: And we're studying dirt.

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:24.216
&gt;&gt;Group: [Speaking Spanish]

00:02:24.716 --> 00:02:25.296
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While most

00:02:25.296 --> 00:02:28.096
of the students are Americans
learning Spanish and Japanese,

00:02:28.636 --> 00:02:32.246
25 percent of John Stanford's
students are immigrants,

00:02:32.596 --> 00:02:34.926
who practice their newly
acquired English skills

00:02:35.496 --> 00:02:38.496
by reciting poetry during
the morning announcements.

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.886
&gt;&gt;All: Alligator pie, alligator pie.

00:02:40.936 --> 00:02:48.116
If I don't get some,
I think I'm gonna die.

00:02:48.466 --> 00:02:52.646
&gt;&gt;Karen: Our children from other
countries are learning English.

00:02:52.646 --> 00:02:57.336
Our children who are English speakers
are learning Japanese and Spanish.

00:02:58.046 --> 00:02:59.676
So we really level the playing field.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:02.836
Everyone understands what it
takes to learn a language,

00:03:03.036 --> 00:03:05.616
and everyone then begins
to appreciate each other.

00:03:06.676 --> 00:03:09.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Technology also
helps level the playing field,

00:03:09.896 --> 00:03:11.566
especially for the newcomers.

00:03:11.976 --> 00:03:14.966
&gt;&gt;Pat: Once you've picked
your flag, then you can write

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.916
about your countries
just a little bit.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:19.936
&gt;&gt;Pat: What the kids are doing
right now is they're working

00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:23.766
on a program called Kid Pix, and
what it does is helps the kids

00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:27.006
to learn how to manipulate
images, how to do some drawing.

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.886
&gt;&gt;Now you can move it like that.

00:03:28.886 --> 00:03:33.066
&gt;&gt;Pat: I think it's so engaging for
a lot of kids, and especially kids

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:36.586
who have come from places where
this technology is not around.

00:03:36.646 --> 00:03:40.606
They're moving in from chalkboards
and their own little slate

00:03:40.606 --> 00:03:43.846
to write on, to this, and I
think it's really empowering.

00:03:43.946 --> 00:03:47.016
I mean, I think that they feel
like they're a part of what's going

00:03:47.016 --> 00:03:47.906
on and a part of the future

00:03:48.516 --> 00:03:52.546
[Singing in Spanish]

00:03:53.046 --> 00:03:56.296
&gt;&gt;Karen: Music as art is a way also
to go in and talk about cultures

00:03:56.346 --> 00:03:57.986
and learn about world cultures.

00:03:58.306 --> 00:04:01.996
We felt if we were going to do
a global curriculum that music

00:04:01.996 --> 00:04:05.286
and art were very important,
as well as learning a language.

00:04:05.496 --> 00:04:07.336
&gt;&gt;Hannah, what are you going to have?

00:04:07.336 --> 00:04:09.876
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kodama, who
started the school in 2000,

00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:13.206
does a bit of everything here,
from serving up lunch every day

00:04:13.586 --> 00:04:15.686
to hosting a constant
stream of visitors.

00:04:16.116 --> 00:04:18.056
&gt;&gt;What would you like?

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:22.716
&gt;&gt;Karen: This is a group of educators
from Japan, and they're here to learn

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:26.376
about an American school
system and to learn from us,

00:04:26.936 --> 00:04:28.716
and I think we learn
just as much from them.

00:04:29.516 --> 00:04:36.846
&gt;&gt;Groups: [Speaking Japanese]

00:04:37.346 --> 00:04:39.476
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Visitors marvel
at the school's ability

00:04:39.476 --> 00:04:43.486
to teach second-language skills
while constantly improving their test

00:04:43.486 --> 00:04:47.836
scores, which for 2005
showed 90 percent proficiency

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:50.066
in English and 79 percent in math.

00:04:51.136 --> 00:04:52.196
&gt;&gt;Gary: When you look
at the background

00:04:52.196 --> 00:04:54.356
of their kids speaking
totally different languages

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:58.536
and learning another language,
to have such high test scores

00:04:58.746 --> 00:05:01.466
in the state is absolutely
remarkable.

00:05:01.886 --> 00:05:06.496
But it actually shows that learning
in other languages actually helps

00:05:06.676 --> 00:05:07.966
in the brain development.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:08.083
&gt;&gt;Group: [Speaking Japanese]

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.956
&gt;&gt;Gary: It's that flexibility

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:16.846
of the brain that's really helping
the brain develop and will be

00:05:16.846 --> 00:05:21.176
with our kids for the
rest of their life.

00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:22.746
&gt;&gt;PJ: If I go to Japan, I want

00:05:22.746 --> 00:05:25.966
to order something to
eat, I just say it.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:28.026
In Japanese.

00:05:28.026 --> 00:05:28.556
It's easy.

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:41.746
[Speaking Japanese] That means, "Can
I please have a hard-boiled egg?"

00:05:42.066 --> 00:05:45.566
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Teacher collaboration
and parent involvement are crucial

00:05:45.566 --> 00:05:48.566
to the success of the
immersion curriculum.

00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:49.906
&gt;&gt;Hiromi: I love team teaching.

00:05:49.906 --> 00:05:53.216
We can see each child
in three dimensions.

00:05:53.386 --> 00:05:55.806
Each teacher has a
different perspective,

00:05:56.456 --> 00:05:59.446
gives a wonderful whole
picture of each student,

00:05:59.476 --> 00:06:03.476
and that helps me teach
each student too.

00:06:03.996 --> 00:06:05.006
&gt;&gt;But he's doing great.

00:06:05.006 --> 00:06:06.686
He's very flexible with numbers.

00:06:06.756 --> 00:06:08.446
&gt;&gt;Amy: So it's our job to be sure

00:06:08.446 --> 00:06:10.816
that we know what the other
teachers are teaching.

00:06:11.016 --> 00:06:14.036
If the Japanese teacher is
teaching geometry in class,

00:06:14.166 --> 00:06:16.846
but the Spanish teacher is
teaching algebraic sense in class,

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:20.846
then I have to somehow find a way
to support both of those concepts

00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:22.696
in each of those different classes.

00:06:22.696 --> 00:06:25.366
And when you share a kid, you have
to always be sure that everybody is

00:06:25.366 --> 00:06:28.016
on the same page, everybody knows
what services their student is

00:06:28.016 --> 00:06:30.776
getting and everybody knows if
the parent has contacted you

00:06:30.776 --> 00:06:33.676
about a situation or an issue that's
come up and we all have to be able

00:06:33.786 --> 00:06:37.586
to have the time to talk to
each other about all that.

00:06:37.586 --> 00:06:40.216
&gt;&gt;Narrator: John Stanford
parents help raise funds to pay

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:42.906
for six native-language
instructional aides.

a sister-school relationship

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:53.736
with Escuela Primera Juan de la
Barrera, the public elementary school

00:06:53.736 --> 00:06:55.566
in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.

00:06:55.566 --> 00:06:57.696
Students and parents raise
money for the school,

00:06:58.226 --> 00:07:00.076
which they visit during
their winter break.

00:07:00.656 --> 00:07:03.416
&gt;&gt;Mary: The kids go into
the classroom for the week

00:07:03.416 --> 00:07:04.486
that we're in Puerto Vallarta.

00:07:04.726 --> 00:07:07.266
They go into complete
immersion at that point.

00:07:07.636 --> 00:07:09.156
It's on the playground
and everywhere.

00:07:09.156 --> 00:07:16.386
Our school offers an understanding
and celebration of culture.

00:07:17.226 --> 00:07:18.426
The kids, they're just going to look

00:07:18.426 --> 00:07:21.556
at the world a completely different
way, and I think that we're really,

00:07:21.676 --> 00:07:23.906
really fortunate to have that.

00:07:24.516 --> 00:07:28.546
[Speaking Japanese]

00:07:29.046 --> 00:07:31.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In addition to
acquiring a second language,

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.936
John Stanford students gain
something even more valuable,

00:07:34.986 --> 00:07:37.556
an appreciation for diversity.

00:07:38.426 --> 00:07:41.156
&gt;&gt;Karen: When we talk
about acceptance of others

00:07:41.436 --> 00:07:44.416
and what it means for children
to be respectful of each other,

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:47.596
you could talk about it and say
you should be nice to others.

00:07:47.836 --> 00:07:52.146
But it's putting children in
situations where they begin to learn

00:07:52.146 --> 00:07:56.726
with each other, play with each
other, and see that we come

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.326
from other cultures and other places,

00:07:58.516 --> 00:08:00.456
but we all smile in
the same language.
