00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.190
Okay, so a final checklist.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.905
&gt;&gt; Yes.
&gt;&gt; All right, tests are all passing.

00:00:03.905 --> 00:00:05.120
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.880
&gt;&gt; And the error cases?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:07.960
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.740
&gt;&gt; The new onboarding flow?

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.464
&gt;&gt; Beautiful.
&gt;&gt; Yes, and

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:13.160
those material design guidelines?

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.960
&gt;&gt; Completed.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.540
&gt;&gt; And then perf?

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.510
&gt;&gt; Well, performance looks
great on my new phone, but

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.770
this older phone
performance is a little.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.190
&gt;&gt; Don't say that word again.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.950
&gt;&gt; What performance?

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.450
&gt;&gt; Behold, it is I,
quote Master of Fame, wait a minute.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:28.360
I've been here before.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.320
&gt;&gt; And now your back.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.320
&gt;&gt; What's he doing here?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.270
&gt;&gt; If you say performance three times,
he'll just magically appear.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.540
&gt;&gt; Ian, Joanna,
what are we doing here at Udacity.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180
I thought we already had
a course on performance.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.770
&gt;&gt; So we do, and
that's why we actually don't need you.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.480
It was an accident.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.840
The words just kind of
fell out of his mouth.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.740
And we definitely don't need
to you to go through any Apps.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.530
We don't have any-
&gt;&gt; Whoa.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.880
Wait.
What are you talking about?

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.800
Do you have a bad performing
application that you need help with?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.755
I knew there was something wrong here.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:00:59.615
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; Well Cole,

00:00:59.615 --> 00:01:03.960
I don't know if you noticed
the performance stuff, but.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.220
Maybe you can help?

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.820
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, sorry, no thank you.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.020
We don't need your help.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.580
The thing is if we actually
know what we're doing, and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.920
we don't need him to kind of jump in and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.940
help us because we can go
through this ourselves.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.110
&gt;&gt; Joanna, Joanna, nonsense.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.190
I'm here to help.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.410
Why don't we go ahead and
take a look at things.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.680
Open up your application on your phone
and why don't you start by telling me

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.280
what you've been seeing in some of the
profiling tools that you've been running

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.360
your app in.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.720
&gt;&gt; Well,
we actually haven't run any tools yet.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.900
Performance has been great.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.300
&gt;&gt; Wait, are you joking?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.230
Is he joking?

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.780
Seriously?

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.800
Are you people punking me?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.610
Are you recording this for
a gag real or something?

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.890
What's going on here?

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.610
&gt;&gt; Can you just give me a minute?

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.940
We haven't tried any tools yet because
we haven't started working on Perf yet.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.670
&gt;&gt; Madam, you insult me.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.350
Performance isn't something
you just idly cast about and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.030
handle at the end of your application.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.000
When you submit your
app to the play store.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.810
Users give negative feedback on it,
three times

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.600
more active than any other thing in your
application that they actually hate.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.330
That alone means that performance
isn't something that you cast

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.130
off until the end.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.880
You bring it up to the front,
you should be doing it the whole way.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.750
&gt;&gt; Okay, take a breath.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.190
Are you breathing?

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.170
Don't you to fall.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.900
That would be a terrible shame.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.110
So what we're actually
trying to get at here,

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.200
is that we have all of these difference
perf tools that are available to help us

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800
see a bunch of different problems.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.550
And kind of walk us through
where maybe there's some issues.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.550
&gt;&gt; Right, there's like trace.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.520
&gt;&gt; Exactly, just like trace.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and we actually have a whole
federation of applications you can

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.280
also run on your application-
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.690
Okay.
Thank you for jumping in.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.820
Your knowledge is valuable.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.780
I was talking.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.000
What we're trying to say here is
there's more than just trace view.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.620
It doesn't end there.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.930
We actually have a different tool for
a bunch of different situations.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.056
Maybe you want to look at
your rendering perf, right?

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:41.725
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Overdraw tool.

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:42.490
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.748
Or maybe you want to see how
your memory's being used.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:45.809
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] Memory allocator.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.550
&gt;&gt; The point is that you
have a different tool for

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.460
different situations and you can
actually use several tools together to

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.180
narrow down where the real
problems are happening so

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.940
you can focus your efforts on fixing the
real problem as opposed to maybe hiding.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:59.060
&gt;&gt; Which, by the way,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.940
we talk about in great deal in our
Android Performance Course here at

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.300
Udacity you can click on
in the instructor notes.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.520
&gt;&gt; I know, I know.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.160
You made a course.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.720
We all know.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.368
We got the tweet.

00:03:09.368 --> 00:03:13.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I saw the tweet.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.480
So, Cole, we really should be testing
the performance before we ship.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.770
&gt;&gt; Oh, yeah, absolutely.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.230
Some of the best engineers I've ever
worked with in my career have all been

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.660
performance minded.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.380
In fact, some of the greatest companies
we have out there will actually create

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.760
unit tests entirely
focused on performance.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.630
So that they can actually find any
performance regressions that occur

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.050
to the line of code that's
checked into their source tree.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:37.980
There's some really exciting stuff
going on right now out there.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:38.980
&gt;&gt; It's so exciting,

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.880
just like your mad scientist
lunch that you have every month.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.810
&gt;&gt; Hey, hey,
that's a little below the belt.

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.740
What is your problem.

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.710
I am here to help.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:48.630
You guys summoned me here to
solve your problem that you have

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.910
in performance on your application.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:50.810
&gt;&gt; I'm going to step out and
get some water.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.390
You guys chat.

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.600
&gt;&gt; And all you've done is
give me grief about this.

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
What's going on?
&gt;&gt; Because I didn't summon you.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.640
You jumped in because you heard there
were performance and you care a lot,

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.830
except maybe some people want to do
their own perf work and don't want you

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.086
doing it for them, because believe it or
not, I know about Android performance.

00:04:04.086 --> 00:04:05.270
And I'm good at Android performance, and

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.570
I'm good enough to teach other
people about it, so let me.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.510
&gt;&gt; Okay, so you think you
know what you're doing, huh?

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.790
&gt;&gt; I do, I do,
&gt;&gt; Prove it.

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:11.290
&gt;&gt; I will.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.610
I'm being summoned.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:16.341
This isn't over.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:21.226
[SOUND]
[SOUND]

00:04:21.226 --> 00:04:22.384
&gt;&gt; Okay, so now that he's gone,

00:04:22.384 --> 00:04:24.168
I'll actually walk you
through the tools, and

00:04:24.168 --> 00:04:26.857
you can see what we're talking about
without him interrupting again.
