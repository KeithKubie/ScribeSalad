Okay. So here's what we're going to need to do our experiment. We'll need some

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:08.182
strawberries, some hot water, some table salt, some

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:11.681
dish soap, some powdered meat tenderizer. Ice cold

00:00:11.681 --> 00:00:15.938
rubbing alcohol or isopropyl alcohol, two coffee

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:20.393
filters, two short and clear drinking glasses, and

00:00:20.393 --> 00:00:25.290
a fork. Each of these materials will play a very specific role in helping us to

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.295
extract DNA from the strawberries. Based

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:31.215
on each material's specified role, which two

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:35.910
will serve the purpose of helping to break down cells and proteins the most?
