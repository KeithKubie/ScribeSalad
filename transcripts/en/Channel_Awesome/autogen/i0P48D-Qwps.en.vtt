kind of this weird anomaly so you have
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
kind of this weird anomaly so you have
to<00:01:01.230><c> address</c><00:01:01.410><c> that</c><00:01:01.500><c> somehow</c><00:01:01.949><c> and</c><00:01:02.370><c> it</c><00:01:03.000><c> looks</c>

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 align:start position:0%
to address that somehow and it looks
 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.230 align:start position:0%
to address that somehow and it looks
like<00:01:03.480><c> the</c><00:01:04.439><c> age</c><00:01:04.619><c> fluctuation</c><00:01:05.610><c> thing</c><00:01:05.820><c> like</c><00:01:06.030><c> it</c>

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
like the age fluctuation thing like it
 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.660 align:start position:0%
like the age fluctuation thing like it
can<00:01:06.510><c> go</c><00:01:07.290><c> backwards</c><00:01:07.799><c> or</c><00:01:07.920><c> forwards</c><00:01:08.340><c> whatever</c>

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 align:start position:0%
can go backwards or forwards whatever
 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.950 align:start position:0%
can go backwards or forwards whatever
but<00:01:08.970><c> I</c><00:01:09.000><c> think</c><00:01:09.330><c> they're</c><00:01:09.420><c> trying</c><00:01:09.510><c> to</c><00:01:09.630><c> show</c><00:01:09.810><c> now</c>

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
but I think they're trying to show now
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.310 align:start position:0%
but I think they're trying to show now
like<00:01:10.170><c> it</c><00:01:10.350><c> can</c><00:01:10.799><c> happen</c><00:01:11.400><c> kind</c><00:01:12.060><c> of</c><00:01:12.270><c> from</c><00:01:12.750><c> you</c><00:01:13.200><c> know</c>

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 align:start position:0%
like it can happen kind of from you know
 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.469 align:start position:0%
like it can happen kind of from you know
naturally<00:01:14.040><c> like</c><00:01:14.310><c> you</c><00:01:14.460><c> can</c><00:01:14.700><c> at</c><00:01:14.970><c> you</c><00:01:15.090><c> get</c><00:01:15.210><c> older</c>

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 align:start position:0%
naturally like you can at you get older
 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 align:start position:0%
naturally like you can at you get older
cuz<00:01:15.689><c> now</c><00:01:15.840><c> at</c><00:01:15.900><c> the</c><00:01:16.080><c> end</c><00:01:16.200><c> he</c><00:01:16.380><c> has</c><00:01:16.470><c> a</c><00:01:16.500><c> pair</c><00:01:16.979><c> and</c><00:01:17.340><c> you</c>

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 align:start position:0%

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
know I think that's more like hey we're
 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.230 align:start position:0%
know I think that's more like hey we're
probably<00:01:19.770><c> gonna</c><00:01:20.040><c> leave</c><00:01:20.189><c> him</c><00:01:20.430><c> like</c><00:01:20.640><c> mostly</c><00:01:21.030><c> the</c>

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
probably gonna leave him like mostly the
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.330 align:start position:0%
probably gonna leave him like mostly the
same<00:01:21.450><c> design</c><00:01:21.780><c> but</c><00:01:21.990><c> his</c><00:01:22.170><c> voice</c><00:01:22.409><c> changes</c><00:01:23.009><c> that's</c>

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 align:start position:0%

could happen because and my guess would
be<00:02:10.679><c> they</c><00:02:10.890><c> don't</c><00:02:11.099><c> even</c><00:02:11.190><c> know</c><00:02:11.370><c> what</c><00:02:11.489><c> they're</c>

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 align:start position:0%
be they don't even know what they're
 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.530 align:start position:0%
