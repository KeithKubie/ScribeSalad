[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.907 --> 00:00:04.990
SIRAJ RAVAL: Hello, world.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.220
It's Siraj, and I teach people
AI on my YouTube channel.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:10.990
I started learning
in college when

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.760
I went to Columbia University.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.470
And when I worked
in the robotics lab,

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.610
seeing robots actually move in
real life got me really hyped,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.060
and I wanted to understand
exactly how they worked.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.420
Since then, I've lived
in San Francisco, worked

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.140
in the industry for a few
years at a couple of jobs,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.550
traveled around the world.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.770
It's been a pretty wild ride.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.500
I've had the opportunity to
speak at some amazing events

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.992
across the world, from the
United Nations to CERN.

00:00:35.992 --> 00:00:37.450
I'm really excited
to attend Google

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.134
I/O, because a lot
of really cool people

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:40.550
are going to be
there, and I think

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.049
it's going to be a
great opportunity

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:44.760
to meet other people
interested in the same field.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.800
I hope to see you there.
