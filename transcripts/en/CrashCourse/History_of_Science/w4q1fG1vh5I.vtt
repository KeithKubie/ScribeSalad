00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.450
We tell a lot of stories about science and
politics on Crash Course.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.630
But it’s hard to get much more political
than the Manhattan Project.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.840
This is the story of the bomb that earned
a capital B and the scars it left on twentieth

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.800
century science and culture.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.420
It’s… not a happy story—sorry in advance.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:30.460
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYS]

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.840
The story picks up where we left off last

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.750
time, with Einstein writing the president
of his new homeland, the United States, urging

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.840
him to build a nuclear weapon before Hitler.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.790
But how did Al even know about this amazingly
powerful weapon?

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.200
For that, we turn to Hungarian–American
physicist Leó Szilárd.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.850
Szilárd read about Ernest Rutherford’s
work with electrons and, in 1933, realized

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.091
that it was theoretically possible to split
apart an atom’s juicy center and create

00:00:58.091 --> 00:01:03.190
nuclear fission—releasing vast amounts of
energy… and thus splitting apart another

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.869
atom… and another… and another.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.900
Thus, Szilárd came up with the idea of a
nuclear chain reaction.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.120
Which could mean a new form of energy!

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.140
Orrrrr… a superweapon.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.420
Szilárd, with the help of hotshot Italian
physicist Enrico Fermi

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.210
quickly patented the idea of a nuclear reactor,
or atomic pile, in 1934.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.650
This device would cause a self-sustaining
nuclear reaction.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.470
Then, in 1938, German physicists actually
achieved fission in the lab.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.370
...and also Hitler annexed Austria, and a year
later, Poland.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.010
War descended again onto the world.

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.390
Szilárd decided that only his and Fermi’s
invention could save it.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.100
So he drafted a letter to President Roosevelt,
with some input from a couple of other physicists.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.280
Only, Szilárd wasn’t famous enough to just,
you know, high-five Roosevelt and get a nuclear

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.810
weapons program off the ground.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.420
But he knew someone who was.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.409
Albert Einstein, the most famous scientist
in the world—possibly ever—signed Szilárd’s

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.409
letter.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.130
It’s only two pages and totally worth Googling.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.239
It basically said, there’s the possibility
of this new super weapon… and the Germans

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.239
might get it first.

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.749
Now, let’s be clear: Einstein was a pacifist.

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.719
But he was also, well, a very smart, deeply
pragmatic person.

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:22.959
In his mind, the only question was—would
the Americans, Germans, or Russians split

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960
the atom first?

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.540
And he foresaw a potentially very bad ending
for Germany, the Jewish people, the free world,

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.579
and science…

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:33.200
He foresaw literally the end of the world.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.549
What happened next is… really, really hard
to understand from today’s perspective:

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:43.579
the U.S. government, with a little help from
Canada, ran an enormously expensive and secret

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.190
weapons program for four years.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.090
Secret even from Congress.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
There were no leaks.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.590
So almost no one on earth understood the possibility
of nuclear physics until it was too late.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.049
This program was code-named the Manhattan
Project.

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:02.790
And it was perhaps the first and clearest
example of Big Science: government-sponsored,

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.180
multi-year, multi-sited, field-defining work.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.129
The Manhattan Project involved 43,000 people,
including a who’s-who of European and North

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:17.140
American scientists in the 40s, from Szilárd
and Fermi to the great Hungarian-American

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.279
mathematician and computer scientist, John
von Neumann.

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.879
The Project had several different parts, but
most of the science-ing happened in a couple

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.879
of places.

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.329
Take us on a fateful ride, ThoughtBubble:

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.730
First stop: the University of Chicago underneath
the football stadium.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.349
Yep, that’s right: the biggest science ever
got physically started in a place no one would

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.629
ever look for it—which sounds like the plot
of a B-movie.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.859
There, in December of 1942, Enrico Fermi,
the “architect of the nuclear age,” created

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.260
the very first controlled nuclear chain reaction—Chicago
Pile 1.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.730
Keep in mind, the Europeans who’d fled Hitler
and the Americans and Canadians who were now

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:58.229
managing their novel experiments had no idea
how far Hitler’s team might have gotten.

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:02.079
Everything was secret, new, and a guess.

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.579
This was science at war.

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:09.189
Second stop: the mines on the Navajo Nation,
which includes parts of Arizona, New Mexico,

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:10.189
and Utah.

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:15.999
Here, starting in 1944, the people who call
themselves the Diné mined a yellow rock containing

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.870
naturally high amounts of the heavy metal
uranium.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.470
The Diné would continue to mine the nation’s
uranium for decades, until 1989, long after

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.360
the peak of the Cold War.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.060
No one knows the full extent of the radiation
exposure, but we can uncontroversially say

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.460
that mining radioactive ore led to higher
rates of lung cancer.

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.780
The U.S. government didn’t act to address
this problem until 1990.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.370
A long, long time after World War Two.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.990
Okay, back in time, third stop: Los Alamos
Laboratory in New Mexico.

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.350
Here, American physics boss Julius Robert
Oppenheimer, AKA “the father of the atomic

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.600
bomb,” oversaw the Project’s scientific
research and the design of the nuclear weapons.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:02.880
And on July 16, 1945, the team led by Oppenheimer
set off the world’s first atomic explosion

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.370
at the Trinity site near Los Alamos.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.580
The bomb was much bigger than anyone had anticipated.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.260
A large mushroom cloud appeared high over
the desert.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:15.730
The test was a success.
Famously, Oppenheimer summed up the moment

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:23.000
by quoting the epic Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad
Gita: “I am become Death, destroyer of worlds.”

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.360
In the story, this is a line that Vishnu says
when he takes on a fearsome, multi-armed form.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.140
Which meant, basically, that Oppenheimer recognized
two things: developing a nuclear weapon was

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.220
like being a god.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.270
And this weapon was about appearing more fearsome
to one’s enemies.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.370
Thanks Thought bubble.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.300
By mid-1945, the biggest enemy of the democratic
world was no longer Germany.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.380
The Allies had invaded and retaken France
in June.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.190
Now, the United States wanted to end the Pacific
War, with Japan.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:57.150
And the United States now had a totally new
weapon, one that created devastation on an

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.470
unprecedented scale.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:01.520
The only choice left was whether or not to
use it.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.530
Most historians today agree that the reason
for dropping the bomb cited at the time—that

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.730
is, to prevent a long, drawn-out war with
Japan—is wrong.

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:13.800
Part of the challenge in writing the bomb’s
history, especially right after the war, was

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.980
that many official documents were classified.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.730
Once documents began to be declassified, such
as Truman’s diaries at the Potsdam Conference,

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:26.560
which became publicly available in 1978, historians
began to change the narrative of why Truman

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.940
dropped the bomb.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:33.500
President Truman—Roosevelt had died earlier
in 1945—was aware that Japan was militarily

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:34.500
weak.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.660
An American victory was basically inevitable.

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.950
Truman was also quite aware of the number
of casualties that would result from the use

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:41.950
of an atomic bomb.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:45.060
The decision to drop it was a well-informed
one.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.500
Besides immediate military victory, two other
reasons factored into this decision.

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.710
One, to justify its monumental cost.

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:58.400
And two, to intimidate all enemies—present
and future—of the United States.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:04.190
On August 6, 1945, the Enola Gay—a B-29
Superfortress bomber named after the mother

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.170
of the pilot—took off from an island six
hours away from Japan.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.810
At just after eight in the morning, Hiroshima-time,
the Enola Gay dropped a ten-thousand-pound

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.540
uranium-235 bomb nicknamed Little Boy that
exploded over the city.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.330
This was the first and deadliest atomic bombing
in history.

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:26.620
Three days later, on August 9, 1945, the United
States dropped a second atomic weapon, a plutonium-239

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.240
weapon nicknamed Fat Man, on another port
city, Nagasaki.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.100
About two hundred thousand people died in
the two bombings and couple of months after.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.370
Japan surrendered unconditionally.

00:07:36.370 --> 00:07:39.860
It remains the only nation to have been attacked
using an atomic weapon.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:45.139
The long-term impact was unknown and unknowable:
even the scientists who created the bomb didn’t

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:48.610
know what would happen, although they had
some pretty strong guesses.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:53.140
After the war, Oppenheimer became director
of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton,

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:54.930
and now there’s an opera about him.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.280
Japan rebuilt.

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:59.510
The United States experienced an unprecedented
economic boom.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:04.300
Yet the end of World War Two and the revelation
of the Manhattan Project did not bring about

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:10.570
world peace—but a smoldering global super-conflict
called the Cold War, between the Soviet Union

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:11.700
and the United States.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.919
The stakes?

00:08:12.919 --> 00:08:14.670
Control of most of the world.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.580
The rules of this game?

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.580
Nuclear physics.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:19.230
The units of success?

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.020
Number of atomic bombs.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:22.460
Size of atomic bombs.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.830
Aaand… that’s it.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.450
Yeah, weird for the conflict that pretty much
organized global politics for forty years.

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:31.000
Okay, so what did the physicists come up with?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.709
The thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb, which
used fusion or the joining together of nuclei

00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:40.189
to create an even bigger reaction than the
first-generation, fission reactors had been

00:08:40.189 --> 00:08:41.189
able to.

00:08:41.189 --> 00:08:42.610
The United States invented this one, too.

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:48.529
The Teller–Ulam design, named after physicists
Edward Teller and Stanisław Ulam, is still

00:08:48.529 --> 00:08:49.529
secret, to this day.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.139
Which is… kind of amazing.

00:08:51.139 --> 00:08:53.199
Teller… was intense.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:57.649
He advocated for using thermonuclear weapons
for all kinds of reasons, including digging

00:08:57.649 --> 00:09:00.610
out convenient, giant artificial harbors.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:04.010
You know, a totally justifiable use of a novel
superweapon!

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.970
Jokes aside, the United States and USSR continued
to build and test these weapons.

00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:14.959
Between 1946 and 1958, the U.S. tested a series
of gigantic nuclear bombs at Bikini Atoll,

00:09:14.959 --> 00:09:18.149
which caused permanent damage, displacing
the Bikini Islanders.

00:09:18.149 --> 00:09:19.149
Forever.

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:20.149
From their own nation.

00:09:20.149 --> 00:09:23.510
This is just one of the most heinous examples
of the lasting social and ecological damage

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.999
of nuclear physics.

00:09:24.999 --> 00:09:27.790
Nuclear fission used for energy production
has not been blameless.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:33.509
You might have heard of the terrible accidents
at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:35.730
1986, and Fukushima Daiichi in 2011.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:40.579
You may not have heard about the accident
in 2014 at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant

00:09:40.579 --> 00:09:45.470
in New Mexico: when the wrong brand of kitty
litter was used in containment, a drum of

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.550
nuclear waste exploded.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:50.319
Nuclear waste is incredibly dangerous for
thousands of years.

00:09:50.319 --> 00:09:53.620
And there is literally tons of it, and no
one knows what to do with it!

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.769
So it all comes down to… kitty litter.

00:09:55.769 --> 00:10:00.579
Aaanyway, we’ll return to the Anthropocene,
or the physical signs of global ecological

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:02.120
collapse, a little later.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.370
The different applications of nuclear energy
are still hotly debated today.

00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:09.930
And so are the different ways of telling the
history of this technology.

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:14.279
For example, when the Smithsonian National
Air and Space Museum tried to mark the anniversary

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:20.130
of dropping the atomic bomb on Hiroshima with
an exhibit, in the 1990s, a debate erupted:

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:23.920
was the United States justified in using this
weapon?

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:27.029
How should historians of technology think
about weapons?

00:10:27.029 --> 00:10:30.509
In fact, this became known as the History
Wars!

00:10:30.509 --> 00:10:35.350
On the application-side, many groups of scientists,
such as the Union of Concerned Scientists,

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:39.339
have criticized nuclear weapons and energy
programs as unnecessary.

00:10:39.339 --> 00:10:44.300
That is, these can been seen as good examples
of the problem of creating shiny, new technologies

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:46.060
simply for technology’s sake.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:51.120
Or maybe, as social scientist Carol Cohn pointed
out in 1987, in her classic portrait of the

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:56.399
U.S. culture of strategizing about global
nuclear war, “Sex and Death in the Rational

00:10:56.399 --> 00:11:00.619
World of Defense Intellectuals,” the whole
point of building bigger, better weapons of

00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:03.860
mass destruction was just to prove you had
the bigger… bomb.

00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:10.059
Next time—the world is still, sigh, at war:
it’s time to examine antibiotics, Nazi science,

00:11:10.059 --> 00:11:11.800
and the rise of biomedicine.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.660
Crash Course History of Science is filmed
in the Dr. Cheryl C. Kinney studio in Missoula,

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:19.880
Montana and it’s made with the help of all
this nice people and our animation team is

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.880
Thought Cafe.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.870
Crash Course is a Complexly production.

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.939

with us, you can check out some of our other
