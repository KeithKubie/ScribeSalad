00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.090
Let's do one more radical
equation example.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.400
And we'll make this one
a slightly hairy one.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.600
So let's say we have the
principal square root of 10

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:20.640
minus 5x plus the principal
square root of 1 minus x is

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.410
equal to 7.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.470
Now, just like I've said over
the last two videos, your goal

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.450
is always to isolate one of the
radicals and then square

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.060
both sides of the equation.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.690
So we can isolate this one right
here by subtracting this

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.710
radical from both sides
of this equation.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.790
So you get minus the square root
of 1 minus x, minus the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.720
square root of 1 minus x.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.180
The left-hand side,
these cancel out.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.690
The left-hand side, you're just
left with the square root

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.870
of 10 minus 5x is equal to--
on the right-hand side, you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.880
have 7 minus the square
root of 1 minus x.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.090
All I did is subtracted this
from both sides, essentially

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.060
moving it over to the
right-hand side.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.820
Now we've isolated one
of the radicals.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.680
Let's square both sides
of this equation.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.170
So this squared, 10 minus 5x
squared, is just going to be--

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.980
or the square root of 10 minus
5x squared, so if I square

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.400
that, that's just going to
be equal to 10 minus 5x.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.210
And this is going to be equal
to this expression squared.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.460
Now, this might look a little
daunting, but you just have to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.710
remember that a plus b squared
is equal to a squared plus 2ab

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.890
plus b squared.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:39.740
In fact, you don't have
to remember it.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.600
You could actually multiply it
out if you ever forget this.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.110
Now, this is just the same
situation where a is 7, and

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.510
our b is negative the square
root of 1 minus x.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.840
So if we expand this out or
multiply this out, this is

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.250
going to be 7 squared,
which is 49.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.920
And then plus 2 times
7 times this.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.660
So this is a negative right
here, so it's going to be

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:15.220
minus 2 times 7 times the square
root of 1 minus x.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.225
So we've got the negative side
from that negative sign, the 7

00:02:18.225 --> 00:02:20.740
is over there, and 1 minus the
square root of 1 minus x is

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.740
there, 2 times it.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.520
When you take a perfect square,
that just ends up,

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.000
when you actually take
the product.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.100
And then finally, plus
this guy squared.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.760
This guy over here squared.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.370
Now the negative part, negative
1 squared, that just

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.550
becomes positive.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.780
Square root of 1 minus x
squared is just going

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.570
to be 1 minus x.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.390
And let's simplify this.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:49.430
So this is going to be equal to
10 minus 5x is equal to--

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.720
well, one thing we can do, let's
add the 49 and the 1.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.830
So you add the 49 and the 1, you
get 50, and then minus--

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:05.020
this is 2 times 7 is 14 times
the square root of 1 minus x.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.440
And then we have this final
minus x out here, minus x.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.090
And let's see what else
we can do here.

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.960
We could subtract 10 from both
sides of this equation.

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.010
I don't want to do too many
steps at once, because this is

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.190
a slightly involved problem.

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.710
So if you subtract 10 from both
sides, you get negative

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:30.080
5x is equal to 40 minus 14 times
the square root of 1

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.790
minus x minus x.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.050
And then we can add x to both
sides, essentially getting rid

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.680
of that character over there.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120
So if you add x to both sides
of this equation, the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.650
left-hand side becomes
negative 4x, and the

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.750
right-hand side, this guy
disappears, and you're just

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.870
left with 40 minus 14 times the
square root of 1 minus x.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.220
And now let's subtract
40 from both sides.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.780
I'm just trying to isolate this
expression right here.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.590
So let's subtract 40
from both sides.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.360
We get negative 4x minus 40 is
equal to negative 14 times the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.279
square root of 1 minus x.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.589
Just subtracted this from both
sides, so it disappeared on

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.519
the right, shows up in negative
form on the left.

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.180
Now, we could square both sides,
but let's simplify it a

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.920
little bit.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.780
Let's divide both sides
by negative 2.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.050
That'll get rid of all of these
negative numbers and

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.520
make the numbers a little
bit smaller.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.580
So you divide everything
by negative 2.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.200
We get 2x-- let me
switch colors.

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:46.170
We get 2x plus the 20 is equal
to 7 times the square

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.450
root of 1 minus x.

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.540
Just divide everything
by negative 2.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.030
40 divided by negative 2 is 20,
14 divided by negative 2

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.560
is positive 7.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.350
Now we could divide by 7, but
that makes things awkward.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.280
We've essentially isolated
the radical.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:02.670
We're scaling it by
a little bit.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.350
But if we square both sides of
this equation, that radical

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:07.930
will disappear.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.030
So let's square both sides
of that equation.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:22.520
The left-hand side becomes 4x
squared plus 2x time 20 is 40x

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:29.330
times 2 is 80x plus 400 is
going to be equal to 7

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.730
squared, which is 49, times
this expression squared.

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:36.760
Well, the square root of 1 minus
x squared is just going

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.435
to be 1 minus x.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.590
Let's just keep going
down here.

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:47.730
I have space down here.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.490
I can just keep going.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.370
So what can we do here?

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.220
I don't want to skip
too many steps.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.790
So 4x squared plus 80x plus
400 is equal to--

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:59.700
distribute the 49.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.040
49 minus 49x.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:09.120
And now, let's see, we
could add 49x to both

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.010
sides of this equation.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.130
Actually, let's do this.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:21.930
Let's add 49x to both sides,
and let's subtract 49 from

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:23.570
both sides of the equation.

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.100
And we are left with--
the left-hand

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.840
side becomes 4x squared.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:40.160
Now, 80 plus 49 is-- 80 plus 40
is 120, so it's going to be

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.830
129, plus 129x.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:51.500
And then 400 minus 49 is 351,
plus 351 is equal to-- these

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.520
guys cancel out, those guys
cancel out-- is equal to 0.

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.920
Now, let me just make sure that
I haven't made some crazy

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.460
mistake because these are
strange-looking numbers.

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:03.230
80 plus 49-- yep, that's right.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.980
129.

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.020
400 minus 49, that's 351.

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.900
Now we have just a straight-up
quadratic equation.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.710
Let's use the quadratic formula
since we have all

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:13.100
these crazy numbers.

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.220
So our solutions, we're
going to get x is

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.330
equal to negative b.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:29.230
So it's negative 129 plus or
minus the square root of 129

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:41.490
squared minus 4 times a, which
is 4, times c, which is 351--

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.920
definitely going to need a
calculator for this one-- all

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:49.990
of that over 2 times a, which
is 2 times 4, which is 8.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.430
Well, let's get our
calculator out to

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:54.660
actually calculate this.

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:58.430
So let's figure out the
discriminant first. So we have

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:07.570
129 squared minus-- we could
say 16 times 351.

00:08:07.570 --> 00:08:11.450
Nope, that's not what
I wanted to do.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.160
16 times 351.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.070
4 times 4 is 16, times 351,
is that crazy number.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.790
Let's take the square
root of it.

00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:26.870
And on this calculator,
you press second and

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:28.380
answer right here.

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.480
That'll use the last answer,
so it's going to take the

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:33.080
square root of that
right there.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.049
It's 105.

00:08:34.049 --> 00:08:36.400
So lucky for us, it's not
that crazy of a number.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:41.650
So we get x is equal to
negative 129 plus or

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:46.050
minus 105 over 8.

00:08:46.050 --> 00:08:47.980
Let's just use a calculator
for this.

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.780
So the first one, if we have
a negative 129 plus

00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:56.600
105, what do we get?

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.580
Negative 24, then you divide
that by 8, that's going to be

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:00.800
negative 3.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.740
So one of our answers
is negative 3.

00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:12.130
Now, what happens if we take
negative 129 minus 105?

00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.980
We get negative 234.

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:16.385
Divide that by 8.

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.250
We get negative 29.25.

00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:26.420
So our two answers are negative
3 and negative 29.25.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.520
So x is equal to negative
3 and x is

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:33.580
equal to negative 29.25.

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:36.440
Now, remember, this is
a radical equation.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:38.970
We have to validate that both
of these work, or if they

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.550
don't work, they're going to
be extraneous solutions, or

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.650
one of them might be an
extraneous solution.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.520
So let's copy these and go
back up to our original

00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:50.210
problem up here, right there.

00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:54.930
Let me paste them, just so we
remember what our solutions

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:58.970
were, and let's just evaluate
them in the calculator, to see

00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:00.220
if they work.

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:04.502
I don't want to use
that calculator.

00:10:04.502 --> 00:10:05.720
I'll Use this calculator.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:06.990
Much better.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.170
All right.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.140
So let's try negative 3.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:19.580
So we're going to take the
square root of 10 minus 5

00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.740
times negative 3-- that's that
right there; we got out of the

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:34.790
radical-- plus the square root
of 1 minus negative 3.

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:35.890
I'm doing nothing in my head.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.060
Obviously, that would be
positive 3, and all of that.

00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:40.200
What is that going
to be equal to?

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.480
It's equal to 7.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.640
So negative 3 definitely
works.

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.920
Now let's try negative 29.25
and see what happens.

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:56.160
So we take-- once again-- the
square root of 10 minus 5

00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.360
times negative 29.25 right?

00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:10.510
Close parentheses plus the
square root of 1 minus

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:19.040
negative 29.25 is equal to 18.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.220
This didn't work.

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.540
It's not even equal
to negative 7.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.040
That's because we took the
principal square roots twice

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.440
or we squared it twice, or we
lost information twice.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.370
But the simple answer is
this does not work.

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.350
It is an extraneous solution.

00:11:32.350 --> 00:11:35.090
We got that solution assuming
not the principal roots,

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.580
assuming the negative square
roots somewhere along here.

00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:39.940
So for this equation that deals
with just the principal

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:44.200
roots, we can say that
this right here is

00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:47.580
an extraneous solution.

00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:51.650
And the only valid solution to
this equation is x is equal to

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:53.320
negative 3.
