00:00:02.274 --> 00:00:03.690
MATT: Professor
Christensen is one

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.750
of the most thoughtful
and interesting

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.260
and engaged people that
I've had a chance to work

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.020
with in my time at Google.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.430
And I'm really, really
excited to allow all of us

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.930
to share a little
bit of that today.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.990
So without further ado,
Professor Clayton Christensen.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.978
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.780
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
You're very kind, Matt.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.770
And I'm just delighted
that you guys would be it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.640
worth your while to come
here and talk about some

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.201
of the things that
I want to propose.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.990
There are three main
objectives in my talk.

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:53.430
The first one is, my gosh,
Google is in a wonderful spot.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.890
And almost never in
the history of mankind

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.680
has anybody seen to be
so successful in much

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.250
that you're trying to do.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.430
And the reason why
I worry about that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.000
is that success is
very hard to sustain.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.630
And if you look across the sweep
of business history, almost

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.790
every company which
at one point were

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.980
widely regarded as
unassailably successful,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.990
10 or 20 years later, you find
them in the middle of the pack

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.420
or the bottom of the heap.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.900
And I'll get into a little
bit about that later.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.620
But the scary
thing about this is

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:43.700
that it's actually
good management that

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.810
causes successful
companies to stumble.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.950
And so, the solutions
that you might think about

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.460
are not solutions at all.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.080
So anyway, that's
one reason why I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.987
came is to just share
the despair that

00:01:59.987 --> 00:02:00.941
comes with success.

00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.372
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.710
And then, the second one
is that growth is actually

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.420
a huge issue everywhere.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.300
Not just American companies, but
Japanese and European companies

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.000
are even more
desperate for growth.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.550
In China, which
has been on a roll

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.910
for over the last 10 years,
find themselves not able

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.920
to grow there.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.410
And politicians are
worried that we can't grow.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.030
And they have no
idea where growth

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.060
comes from at the level
of national economies.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.820
And if our nations
are not prosperous,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:50.370
then companies find it
hard to be prosperous.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.110
So that's what I want to talk
about if that's all right.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.000
And what I'd like to
offer to you, which

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.200
is my third objective
today, is that I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.360
want to talk to you about
theories about management.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.230
And the word "theories" gets
a bum wrap with managers,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.570
because the word
"theory" is associated

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.920
with the word "theoretical,"
which connotes impractical.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.800
But a theory is a
statement of causality.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.760
It's a statement of what
causes what and why.

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.700
And when you think
about it in those terms,

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.050
you as technologists or
managers are voracious consumers

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:35.400
of theory.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.370
Because every time
you take an action,

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.850
it's predicated upon a
belief that, if you do this,

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.460
you'll get the
result that you want.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.010
And every time you
put a plan into place,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.630
it's predicated upon a set
of theories, which tells you,

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.820
if you do these things,
you'll be successful.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.690
But most of the people aren't
even aware of the theories

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:57.420
that they use.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.920
And many times, the
theories that you use

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.640
are destructive rather
than productive.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.780
So this is why I have spent
much of my academic life trying

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.370
to understand theories
about management.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.390
So there's not one grand
theory of management

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.450
that solves all
problems of managers.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.090
But there really are theories
about different dimensions

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.180
of a manager's job,
which are quite helpful.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.540
And you'll see some of those,
as I'll present them today.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:42.060
And it is as if, if
you came to my office,

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.580
there would be a shelf there.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.290
And on the shelf will be a set
of theories about management.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:54.940
And some of them have
emerged from my own research.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.540
And next to them are
theories about management

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:01.090
that other members of
our faculty have offered.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.080
And there are a few
slots on the shelf that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.820
aren't filled, because
there are really

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.490
important theories about
management for which nobody

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.120
has provided a theory yet.

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.390
So for example, metrics
and how you measure

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.360
things is a huge deal.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.130
And yet, there isn't a
theory about metrics.

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:28.770
But with these as a
set of building blocks,

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.980
if somebody can then come
to us with a problem,

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.190
rather than giving them
my opinion about how

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.460
to solve the problem, instead
what we're able to do is say,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.200
well if that's the
problem, you know,

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.790
then we have a theory
on the shelf called

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.150
the theory of disruption.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.320
And I bet you that
if we put that theory

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.070
on like a set of lenses
and examine this problem,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.470
we might be able to
understand what's going on.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.370
And so that's what I want
to do is explain to you

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.760
a set of problems for which
good theories might help you.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.970
And I picked these ones
because I think you probably

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:16.380
are facing similar problems.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:21.290
So if you think about
our economy much,

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:26.550
you'd realize that occasionally
we have a recession.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.740
And when our economy
goes into recession,

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.600
we'll hit bottom at some point.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.890
And then, it takes some
time before companies have

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:40.580
to start hiring people again.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.650
Because the people
who are on board

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.060
can satisfy the demand
of getting more orders

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.110
for a while.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:56.060
And we have had nine
recessions since World War II.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.390
And in the first six of
those nine recessions,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.360
on average, it took
our economy six months

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.400
from the point when they hit
bottom to get to the point

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.000
where they needed to
hire more workers.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.930
But we had a recession
in 1991, '92,

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.210
where it took our economy 15
months to get to the point

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:24.290
where they needed to
hire people again.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:30.720
Then, we had a
recession in 2001, '02.

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.950
So it took us 15 months in that
recession to get to the point

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:37.400
where they had to hire people.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:43.200
Then, we had a recession in '01,
'02 where it took our economy

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.630
39 months, in aggregate,
to get to the point where

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.680
they're hiring more people.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.990
Then the most recent
recession it took us

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.790
our economy nearly six
years to get to the point

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.560
where we needed to
hire more people.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:01.010
And what seems to be
happening increasingly

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:05.690
is these rebounds appear
to be financial, not

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.210
real in character.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:12.380
So the people who have money
get a lot of money a lot faster.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:15.140
But the rest of
us, there are not

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:19.830
jobs into which we can
be slotted in anymore.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:24.530
And something fundamentally has
gone wrong with our economy.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.730
And what we see
in the economy is

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:32.780
a summary of what's going on
in most companies as well.

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.860
So I want to propose
that there are four

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.669
different types of innovations.

00:08:38.669 --> 00:08:42.260
And the reason why I'd
like to focus on innovation

00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.770
is because, whenever a
company makes an investment,

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.590
they invest in an innovation
of one sort or another.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.120
And so, what I want to
do is describe these four

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:56.470
types of innovations and
then teach a little bit more

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.830
about whether and why and
where they will create growth.

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:04.210
There are potential
products, meaning nobody's

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:06.980
figured out what these are yet.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:10.200
Then the second one are
sustaining innovations that

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.690
make those products better.

00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:18.230
The third are disruptive
products that grow markets.

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:21.140
And then, the fourth are
efficiency innovations

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:26.040
in which they sell them off in
order to get their money back.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.326
So let me start with
potential innovations.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.230
Almost any study
about innovation

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:43.280
will say that, of all of
the products whose product

00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:50.120
development are initiated in a
company, only about 15% to 25%

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.790
of them will become
financially successful.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:10:00.680
And it's broadly viewed that
innovation is a crapshoot.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.670
The more projects you launch,
the more success you'll be.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.750
But in its end,
it's a crapshoot.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.070
And what we've concluded
is that it's not true.

00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:19.700
The reason why it appears that
we can't predict in advance

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:23.390
whether a customer will buy the
products that we're developing

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.390
is that people at business
schools like Harvard

00:10:28.390 --> 00:10:33.210
teach marketing
in a perverse way.

00:10:33.210 --> 00:10:36.890
And in particular, we've decided
that understanding the customer

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:40.140
is the wrong unit of analysis.

00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.550
So to illustrate that, just
look at me for a second

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:45.120
if you wouldn't mind.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.840
My name is Clayton Christensen.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.230
I am 64-years old unfortunately.

00:10:52.230 --> 00:11:00.710
I used to be 6 feet 8
inches, unfortunately.

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:06.860
And I now am 6 feet 6
inches, unfortunately.

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:11.220
And I married a wonderful
wife, fortunately.

00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:12.570
We have five kids.

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.900
The third of them,
Michael, unfortunately

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.240
came here to Stanford.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:21.010
And I have all kinds of other
characteristics and attributes,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:22.780
as you can see.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:25.260
But none of my
characteristics or attributes

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:30.090
have not yet caused me to buy
the "New York Times" today.

00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:33.950
There might be a correlation
between the propensity

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:37.090
that I will buy the
"New York Times."

00:11:37.090 --> 00:11:41.610
But my characteristics
don't cause me to buy it.

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:44.030
Nor do our characteristics
and attributes

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.480
cause us to buy any
product or service.

00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.790
And yet, almost all
of the work that we

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:53.590
do in assessing
market potential,

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.870
we look at the
characteristics or attributes

00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:59.750
of the potential customers.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:03.730
And a better way to
think of it, we decided,

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:10.720
is that, darn it, every
day stuff happens to us.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.640
Jobs arise in our life.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.010
And when we these
jobs arise, we need

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:19.610
to find some way to
get the jobs done.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:22.750
And some of the jobs are
simple incremental things

00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:24.800
that happen regularly.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.090
Others are dramatic and
important breakthrough

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:29.640
problems.

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.030
But whenever we
have a job to do,

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:36.060
we have to find something
and pull it into our lives

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.420
in order to get the job done.

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:42.470
And what we decided is
understanding the job

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.920
is the critical key
to develop products

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:52.780
that we can predictably make
and find the customers to buy.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:59.640
So to illustrate this
point, a number of years

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.570
ago, as this idea of
the job to be done

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:06.180
was emerging from our
research, McDonald's was

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.640
trying to decide how
they could improve

00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.760
the sales of their milkshakes.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.880
And as some of you might
know, McDonald's is

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:19.510
a very sophisticated
marketing company.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.080
And they have data out the
gazoo about every dimension

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.990
of what they're doing.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:33.470
And so, when you
go in, on the menu,

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:38.600
behind that there is a profile
of the demographic profile

00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.540
of the quintessential
customer that

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:45.230
likes to buy that
product when they come.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.220
And so, what
they've done is they

00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.470
have these cohorts
of people who are

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:54.650
the quintessential milkshake
customers, for example.

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:58.960
And it turns out that I
fit that profile perfectly.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.190
So they would take people
like me into conference rooms

00:14:03.190 --> 00:14:06.240
and ask, can you
just help us how

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.820
we could improve the milkshake
so you'd buy more of them?

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:12.790
The customers would
provide very clear guidance

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.630
about how to improve it.

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:17.920
They would then improve the
product on those dimensions.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:23.970
And it had no impact or sales
whatsoever on the product.

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:28.350
So what we decided is that
that's not the right way

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:29.080
to frame it.

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.130
But rather, there's
got to be a job

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:35.790
out there somewhere that
people find themselves needing

00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:42.570
to get done for which they go to
McDonald's to hire a milkshake.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.240
And we need to understand
what the job is.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.670
So one of our colleagues
stood in a restaurant one

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:56.040
day for 18 hours and just
took very careful notes on,

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:58.650
what time did they
buy these milkshakes?

00:14:58.650 --> 00:14:59.710
What was he wearing?

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.480
Was he alone or
with other people?

00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.720
Did he buy anything else
or just the milkshake?

00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.510
Did they eat it in the
restaurant or get in the car

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.410
and go off with it?

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:14.850
And it turned out that
about 50% of the customers

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:18.880
bought the milkshake
before 8:30 in the morning.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.620
It was the only
thing they bought.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:21.820
They were always alone.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.620
And they always got in the
car and drove off with it.

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.950
So we decided we need to
understand, what was this job?

00:15:31.950 --> 00:15:35.280
So we came back the next day
and we positioned ourselves

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.600
outside the
restaurant so that we

00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:40.480
could confront these
people as they were

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.730
emerging with their milkshake.

00:15:41.730 --> 00:15:43.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.500
And in language that they could
understand, we asked them,

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:51.760
I got a problem with
your behavior here.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.320
What job were you trying to do
that caused you to come here

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.670
to hire this milkshake?

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.380
And as they would
struggle to answer,

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:02.070
we'd try to help them by
asking, well, look, think

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.610
about the last time you
were in the same situation,

00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:07.110
needing to get
the same job done,

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:09.900
but you didn't come here
to hire a milkshake.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.060
What did you hire to do the job?

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:16.370
And it turned out that they
all had the same job to do.

00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:21.100
And that is they had a long
and boring drive to work.

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:24.440
And gosh, one hand had
to be on the wheel.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:26.430
But somebody gave
me another hand.

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:29.520
And there isn't anything
in it to drive with.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:34.150
And I just need to do
something while I'm driving.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.940
And I'm not hungry yet,
but I know that I'll

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.380
be hungry by 10 o'clock.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:42.140
So I also need something that
will just go thunk, and stay

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:45.530
there till 10 o'clock.

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:51.530
So when I have this problem
to do, what else do I hire?

00:16:51.530 --> 00:16:54.310
And one guy said, I never
thought of it in these terms.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:58.360
But last Friday, I hired
a banana to do the job.

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.750
Take my word for it.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.420
Never hire bananas.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:04.650
They're gone in
less than a minute.

00:17:04.650 --> 00:17:07.280
I'm hungry by 7:30.

00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:10.619
Another guy said, you promise
not to tell my wife please.

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:14.920
But I hire donuts a lot
to get this job done.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.290
But they actually
don't do the job well.

00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:19.490
I promised my wife that
I'm going to lose money.

00:17:19.490 --> 00:17:21.450
But I add it.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:25.020
And they crumble
all over my clothes.

00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:26.979
And my fingers get gooey.

00:17:26.979 --> 00:17:29.530
And I put that on the wheel.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:32.170
And another guy said, yeah,
I do bagels sometimes.

00:17:32.170 --> 00:17:37.120
But geez, the bagels are
so dry and tasteless.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.530
I have to steer the
car with my knees

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.110
while I put the cream cheese on.

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:44.440
And then, if the phone
rings, I got three problems

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.590
and two hands.

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:49.960
And one guy said, I hired a
Snickers bar to do the job.

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:53.690
But I felt so guilty I've
never heard Snickers again.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.140
But let me tell you,
whenever I have this job

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:03.200
and I come here to hire
McDonald's milkshakes,

00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:07.320
it is so viscous, it
takes me 23 minutes

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:10.960
to suck it up that
thin little straw.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.660
Who knows what the
ingredients are.

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.420
I don't care.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:17.160
All I know is it's in
my stomach all morning.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.230
And it fits right
in my cup holder.

00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:25.060
And it turns out the milkshake
does the job better than any

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:26.830
of the competitors.

00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:29.590
And the competitors are
not Burger King milkshakes.

00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:32.910
But it's bananas and donuts
and bagels and Snickers bars

00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:36.660
and coffee and a
few other things.

00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:38.800
And then, it turned out
that in the afternoon,

00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.110
it was hired for a
very different job.

00:18:42.110 --> 00:18:44.930
And that is somebody
is a parent,

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:50.180
just needs to have a
sweet uncluttered time

00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:55.780
to talk about whatever's
on the mind of their child.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.260
And they hire the
milkshakes to do this job.

00:18:58.260 --> 00:18:59.680
And it does that job very well.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:04.550
But it's a very different job
than what the morning job is.

00:19:04.550 --> 00:19:07.790
And it turns out that
this is not unusual

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.400
that almost always,
Peter Drucker said,

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.830
the customer rarely
buys what the company

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.010
thinks it's selling them.

00:19:15.010 --> 00:19:18.600
And that's why I
said at the beginning

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:23.270
that understanding the job is
what's critical in developing

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:25.270
successful products.

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:28.580
The customer is the
wrong unit of analysis.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:32.600
Because the customer
finds herself

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.950
needing to have
different jobs to be

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.655
done over the course of a
day or a week or a month.

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:45.130
So there's a job out
there somewhere near here

00:19:45.130 --> 00:19:46.260
that needs to get done.

00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:49.090
And people find
themselves needing

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:54.870
to get this job's job done
in different frequencies.

00:19:54.870 --> 00:19:56.860
And that is, I need
to get this from here

00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.160
to there as fast as possible
with perfect certainty.

00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.960
How many of you
have found that you

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:08.740
needed to get this job
done in the last year?

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.462
Almost everybody.

00:20:10.462 --> 00:20:14.560
It turns out that Julius
Caesar had this job to do.

00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.980
But when he had
the job, he could

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.120
hire a horseman and a
chariot to get the job done.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:24.690
Queen Victoria had the
very same job to do.

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:27.620
But she could hire the
telegraph and the railroad

00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.670
to get the job done.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:37.460
And Winston Churchill could
hire a airplane to get it done.

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.100
And now, our leaders
can hire DHL.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:45.380
But the job itself has been
fundamentally unchanged

00:20:45.380 --> 00:20:47.320
over these centuries.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.880
And that's a
characteristic of most jobs

00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:54.330
that they are very
stable over time.

00:20:54.330 --> 00:20:58.530
But the technology that we
could hire to get the job done

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:06.240
changes at a scaring
rate in some times.

00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.460
And so, if we think of the
business that we're in as,

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:21.660
I'm in the business of DHL
and I compete against FedEx,

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:25.930
my life is very unpredictable.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:30.530
But if I think of the job to
be done as the core business,

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.310
then life is very stable.

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:35.920
And it makes it a lot easier
for us to predict what

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.125
will be the next technology.

00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:43.480
Let me just
describe-- I'm sorry.

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:46.800
I need to tell you a
couple things about myself.

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:50.990
I'm stumbling
around, because I've

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:54.800
had a couple of rounds of
chemotherapy for cancers

00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:55.470
that I've had.

00:21:55.470 --> 00:22:00.075
And one of the side effects
is that I can't feel my feet.

00:22:03.770 --> 00:22:06.360
So when I'm looking
at you, I don't

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:09.300
know if my feet are
over there or here.

00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.220
And then, I had a stroke.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.230
A clot came from somewhere
and lodged itself right there

00:22:14.230 --> 00:22:15.760
in my brain.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.450
And it formulated the portion
of my speech where we formulate.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.960
It killed the
portion of my brain

00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.290
where you formulate speech.

00:22:26.290 --> 00:22:28.730
This happened about
four years ago.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:31.860
And just like that, I
lost my ability to speak.

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:37.130
And I've been trying to
learn how to speak again.

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:41.070
And there's a program called
Rosetta Stone for English.

00:22:41.070 --> 00:22:42.417
Turns out, it is very good.

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:48.730
But you see in my
language, sometimes, I'm

00:22:48.730 --> 00:22:50.710
struggling to come
up with the word.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.870
And that's because I lost it.

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:56.290
And I'm learning how to
speak from the other side

00:22:56.290 --> 00:22:57.900
of my brain.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.050
And I noticed that
I notice that I'm

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.850
speaking to the floor a lot.

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:06.920
And the reason why is,
if I look at the floor,

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:11.480
I can focus on what the
next sentence has to be.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:15.960
And if I look at
you, you distract me.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:20.830
So it's not that I have
become shy all of a sudden.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.440
So I apologize for that.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:32.010
Anyway, there is an architecture
to every job to be done.

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:37.130
So the fundamental
foundation is there

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:39.350
is a job that I
need to know, given

00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:41.940
the situation that I'm in.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:45.665
And that's an important reason
why understanding the customer

00:23:45.665 --> 00:23:48.240
is the wrong unit of analysis.

00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:51.900
Because the
situation that I'm in

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.300
has a huge impact on
the nature of the job.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.160
And every job has a
functional and emotional

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.220
and a social
dimension to the job.

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:06.590
And the mix of those three
depends upon the application

00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:09.070
of the situation they're in.

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:11.950
If we understand
what the job is,

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.680
then we can ask
the next question.

00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.560
So what are the experiences
in purchase and use

00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:24.350
that we need to provide in
order to do the job perfectly?

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:27.830
And if we understand what
those experiences are,

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.450
then we know what to integrate
and how to integrate it

00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:34.120
so that we can provide
the experiences needed

00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.350
to get the job done.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:41.370
And if we understand that, then
it tells us what kind of brand

00:24:41.370 --> 00:24:44.290
we need to apply
to that product.

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:45.810
So that when they
find themselves

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:49.920
needing to get the
job done, that brand

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.340
pops into their head.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:25:03.490
So to summarize why it's
important-- the reason

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.560
why we need to understand the
opportunity in terms of the job

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.490
rather than the customer.

00:25:11.490 --> 00:25:16.620
We need to understand what the
job the customer needs to do.

00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:22.260
We need to understand how
customers will choose us.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:25.190
And we also need to
then be able to say

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.000
what we can do that
other people can't,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.290
which is how we integrate.

00:25:30.290 --> 00:25:33.910
And finally, how
will everyone know

00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:35.775
what product does the job best.

00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:43.360
There's a job that
arises in people's lives

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.590
that happened to our son
Mike when he came out here

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.980
to start at Stanford.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.680
And after a couple
days out here,

00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.160
he called Christine and me back.

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:56.760
And he said, Mom and Dad,
I found our apartment.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:01.950
And I need to furnish
my apartment tomorrow.

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.330
And so there's a job that
Mike needed to be done.

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.540
That is, I need to furnish
my apartment tomorrow.

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:13.750
When you find that you
have that job to be done,

00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:16.740
is there a brand that
pops into your mind that

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:22.275
says, this is what I can do to
get this job done perfectly?

00:26:22.275 --> 00:26:22.900
AUDIENCE: Ikea.

00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:24.200
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Ikea.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.950
How many of you said the
word Ikea in your mind

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:30.510
when I told you
what the job was?

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:32.280
Look around.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.985
Isn't that interesting?

00:26:34.985 --> 00:26:38.970
And that's what we mean
by a purpose brand.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:44.240
We need to organize our product
around a job that does it

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:48.800
so perfectly that anybody
around the world who

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.310
find themselves needing
to get that job done,

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:54.360
they think of Ikea.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:57.740
And Ikea has no competitors.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:27:02.440
There are other retailers
that sell furniture.

00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.500
But there is nobody in the
world that is organized

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.410
around that job to be done.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:13.840
As a result, they are
wildly profitable.

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:15.550
And you think about
this for a minute.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:19.100
Their owner is the third
richest guy in the world.

00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:25.750
The quality of the furniture
that they buy is marginal.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:31.518
And they sell it to the low end
of humanity, college graduates.

00:27:31.518 --> 00:27:35.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:41.790
And clearly, they are
able to get a premium.

00:27:41.790 --> 00:27:44.220
Their customers are
delighted to pay a premium

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:47.290
price for their products.

00:27:47.290 --> 00:27:52.850
And the reason why
that is is that,

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:57.680
if you hire a product to get
the job done and it doesn't

00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:01.890
do the job well, then
you have to take it back

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:08.370
or throw it away or give it or
repair it and go out and find

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.320
something that will
do the job done well.

00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.960
And if that doesn't
do well, then you

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.640
have to test it and
talk to your friends.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:21.730
And when you find
yourselves buying a product

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.670
and you find that it
doesn't do the job well,

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:30.410
it is very costly to find
something that does it well.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:32.730
And that's the
reason why it can be

00:28:32.730 --> 00:28:37.270
so profitable if you organize
around a job to be done.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:41.050
Because the customers will
be delighted to pay a premium

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:46.270
price for your product, because
the alternative of something

00:28:46.270 --> 00:28:49.950
that doesn't do the job
well is very costly.

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.950
So that's the first
type of innovation.

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:03.060
And we call them
potential products,

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:07.010
because we don't know their
potential unless we understand

00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.510
the job to be done.

00:29:09.510 --> 00:29:12.070
The second type of
innovation we call

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:17.260
sustaining products that
make good products better.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.940
And so, the day after we
launch into a new product

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:22.730
where you figured
out there's a job

00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.840
to be done-- we have a
product to do the job well--

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:31.200
immediately, we start
improving those products.

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.580
And we call those products
sustaining innovations.

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.030
And they're important.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:41.300
When we look around the world
as we walk around, almost all

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:46.460
of the innovations that we
see are sustaining products.

00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.590
They help companies keep
their margins healthy.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:52.040
They are the mechanism
for gaining market share.

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:55.560
And those of you who
are working on AdWords

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.990
and other of your
products are engaged

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:00.570
in sustaining innovations.

00:30:00.570 --> 00:30:02.230
They're critical.

00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:06.700
But because they replace
older products with new ones,

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.330
they don't create growth.

00:30:09.330 --> 00:30:12.510
So imagine that I'm
working for Toyota.

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:17.340
And I convince you to buy
the Prius, the hybrid car.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:20.810
Then, you won't
be buying a Camry.

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:22.890
If I sell you this
year's best product,

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:25.680
you won't buy last
year's best product.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:29.380
And so, by their very nature,
sustaining innovations,

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:33.910
although they are important,
are replicative in character.

00:30:33.910 --> 00:30:39.880
And most of what we think about
as innovation are of this sort.

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.120
So that's the second
type of innovations.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:47.140
The third type of innovation
we call disruption.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:50.270
And they create growth.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:53.530
So let me describe-- this
is going to be a complicated

00:30:53.530 --> 00:30:54.910
slide before we're done.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.590
So I apologize in advance.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.180
But you'll see these
three concentric circles.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:03.000
And what they're
made to represent

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.180
is that, actually,
you can describe

00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:11.680
the history of any company in
terms of these three circles.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.630
The innermost circle
represents the customers

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:18.370
who have the most money
and the best access

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.010
to a product or service.

00:31:21.010 --> 00:31:23.140
And then, as you go
to the larger circles,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.350
they represent
larger populations

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:29.400
of people who have
progressively less money.

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.350
Almost always, industries
begin in the center,

00:31:33.350 --> 00:31:36.150
because the first
products and services

00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:40.420
are so costly and complicated
that only people who

00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:44.370
have a lot of that are
able to buy it and use it.

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:49.190
So given that, I want to then
describe what disruption is

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:52.430
and why it creates growth.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.870
So I'll put on the vertical
axis the performance of product

00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:59.480
or services over time.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.200
In every market there
are two trajectories.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:14.190
The first one is,
in every market

00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:16.010
there is a trajectory
of improvement

00:32:16.010 --> 00:32:20.000
that customers are able
to utilize in their lives.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.640
And we don't think
about this very much,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:25.350
but our lives
don't change a lot.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.380
And that's why this is so flat.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.050
Then, in every market,
there's a different trajectory

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:35.070
of improvement that
innovating companies

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:39.860
provide as they keep introducing
better and better products.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.693
And the most important
finding about this

00:32:42.693 --> 00:32:46.130
is this trajectory of
technological progress

00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:50.480
almost always outstrips
the ability of customers

00:32:50.480 --> 00:32:52.530
to use the product.

00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:55.400
And what it means is
that a technology,

00:32:55.400 --> 00:33:00.250
at the beginning that
isn't very good actually

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:03.640
is prone to overshoot what
those same customers are

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:07.130
able to utilize at a
later point in time.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:12.390
And there's not much
gray hair in the room.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:16.790
But if you talk to somebody
who was in their teens

00:33:16.790 --> 00:33:22.140
or 20s in the 1980s,
we were, at that time,

00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:30.480
trying to figure out
how to use, learning how

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.780
to type on those early
personal computers.

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:38.810
About every 30 seconds, you had
to stop and let the Intel 286

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:41.220
chip catch up to you.

00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:44.810
Because the world's fastest
microprocessor could not even

00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:49.040
keep pace with our fingers
on the left-hand side.

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.250
But if you take your
computer apart now and just

00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:56.930
look at the
microprocessor there,

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:03.600
we utilize only about 15% of the
capability of that processor.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.540
Intel has just way overshot what
most customers in mainstream

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:11.670
applications are able to use.

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:15.010
Now, some of the innovations
that help good products better

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:17.340
are incremental innovations.

00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:20.150
Others are dramatic
breakthrough innovations.

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:22.300
But we use a word
for them that we

00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.770
call sustaining innovations,
which was on the last slide,

00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:30.130
because they're
really important.

00:34:30.130 --> 00:34:33.250
Almost always,
incumbent companies

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.889
who are the leaders on the
left-hand side of the diagram

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:40.290
find themselves still
on top of the industry

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:44.350
when these battles of
sustaining innovation are over.

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:48.130
And if you want to
start a new business

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:51.389
and you want it to
be successful and you

00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:54.630
think you can beat the
incumbents by making better

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:57.610
products that you could
sell for better profits

00:34:57.610 --> 00:35:00.980
to the customers
best competitors,

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:03.450
they will kill you.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:06.540
And the evidence is
really very strong.

00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:11.250
It doesn't matter how
big or powerful you are.

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:17.200
If you think that you can beat
the incumbents in their market,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:19.320
they will kill you.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:22.280
And we could spend a
lot of time on that.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.620
But there's another
type of innovation

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:27.390
that we call
disruptive innovations.

00:35:27.390 --> 00:35:30.270
And disruptive
innovations transform

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:31.790
products which, in
the middle, were

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.390
too complicated and expensive.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:38.720
Now, disruption makes it so much
more affordable and accessible

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:42.480
that many more people are
able to use those products

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:43.960
or services.

00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.660
And almost always, entering
companies typically

00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:50.410
win at disruption.

00:35:50.410 --> 00:35:55.230
And that's exactly
what Google did, right?

00:35:55.230 --> 00:36:01.610
Because advertisement and
finding customers and making

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:04.600
things known-- you had
to have a lot of money

00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:06.680
to play in that game.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.820
And then, your
technologies and services

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:12.210
made it so that
anybody could find

00:36:12.210 --> 00:36:16.570
what they needed, whether
you're a buyer or a seller.

00:36:16.570 --> 00:36:18.650
And you changed
the world by making

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:21.130
it affordable and accessible.

00:36:21.130 --> 00:36:26.040
And none of the incumbents
who you guys beat

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:30.130
are around today, because
entrants typically win.

00:36:30.130 --> 00:36:33.530
And let me describe why.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:39.580
So living in Boston as we have
for the last three decades,

00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:43.670
there was, in the 1970s and
'80s a company there called

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:46.890
Digital Equipment Corporation.

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:52.930
And at that time, Digital was
widely viewed as Google is now.

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:57.380
It was the most widely admired
company in all the world.

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:00.220
And when you read
explanations about why

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.970
they were so successful,
always success

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:08.450
was attributed to the brilliance
of their management team.

00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:11.290
Then, about 1988,
Digital Equipment

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:17.060
just fell off the cliff and
began to unravel very quickly.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:19.630
When you then read
explanations about why

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.040
they had stumbled
so badly, always it

00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:25.870
was attributed to the ineptitude
of the management team.

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:30.040
And the very same people
were running the company.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:33.180
And for a while, I framed
the problem as, gosh,

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.960
I wonder how smart people
could get so stupid so fast?

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.400
And that's really
the explanation

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:45.780
that most people churn up
when a company stumbles.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.000
That somehow, a company that
the management team that

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.760
had its act together at one
point were out of their league

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:55.060
at another time.

00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:59.790
But the real reason why the
stupid manager hypothesis just

00:37:59.790 --> 00:38:03.600
didn't feel right is
that every company that

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:05.550
made the same class
of computers-- we

00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:07.080
called them mini-computers.

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:12.350
They were about the
size of this pulpit.

00:38:12.350 --> 00:38:17.160
Every company that made
that were killed in unison.

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:21.220
It wasn't just
Digital Equipment.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:24.670
But it was Data General,
Prime, Wang, Nixdorf, Hewlett

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:26.790
Packard, Honeywell.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:29.860
And you'd expect these
people to collude on pricing

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:30.760
occasionally.

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:33.190
But to collude to
collapse was a stretch.

00:38:33.190 --> 00:38:35.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.210
And trying to understand
why they'd do that

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.100
was the puzzle that we had.

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.010
So as we understood it
a little bit better,

00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.650
we realized that
this minicomputer

00:38:47.650 --> 00:38:49.490
was quite a complicated
product that

00:38:49.490 --> 00:38:52.000
had to be sold direct
to the customer.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.480
And the selling process involved
a lot of training and support

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.560
and service and software.

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:02.040
And you had to have a cost
like that in the business

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:03.950
to play in the game.

00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:06.350
And that meant that
Digital Equipment

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:10.510
had to generate
gross margins of 45%

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:15.390
on computers that
sold for $250,000.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.880
And that's how they
made their money.

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:21.710
Now, in their company,
as in every company,

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:24.430
there were people coming
in through the 1980s

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:27.740
all the time with
ideas for new products

00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.640
that they could develop.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.250
Some of these entailed making
better products than they

00:39:34.250 --> 00:39:36.120
had ever made before.

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.600
In fact, these mini-computers
would be so good

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.420
that they could reach up
into the tiers of the market

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:45.510
where people historically had
to buy mainframe computers.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:47.650
You looked at those
business models.

00:39:47.650 --> 00:39:51.160
They could generate
gross margins of 60%.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.180
And you could sell the products
for twice as much money.

00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.640
So while the
management was trying

00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:58.620
to decide if that's
what they should do,

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.400
there were other people
coming in saying, ladies

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.920
and gentlemen, you don't get it.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.830
Just look out the window.

00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:08.180
Everybody is buying
personal computers,

00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:12.280
which was the case in
the 1970s and '80s.

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:20.520
But when management
would look out, in fact,

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.020
they could see that everybody
was making personal computers.

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:25.770
But there were a
couple of other things

00:40:25.770 --> 00:40:28.090
that bothered them a lot.

00:40:28.090 --> 00:40:30.120
The first one-- do
you remember how

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.930
crummy those early
personal computers were?

00:40:33.930 --> 00:40:39.790
Apple sold the Apple II
as a toy to children.

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.230
Not a single one of
Digital's customers

00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:46.750
could even use a personal
computer for the first 10 years

00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:48.890
that they were in
the management.

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:52.470
And then, they got no
signal from their customers

00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.150
that the personal
computer mattered.

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:57.250
Because in fact,
it didn't to them.

00:40:57.250 --> 00:41:02.740
And then, when you looked
at the business details,

00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.630
it looked a lot worse.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:08.100
Because these small
computers only

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:10.400
generated gross margins of 40%.

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:13.010
And they were headed
to 20% quickly.

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:15.440
And you could only earn
those paltry percentages

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:19.110
on computers that
sold for $2,000 bucks.

00:41:19.110 --> 00:41:22.990
And so, the question that
the management had to address

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:26.830
was, gosh, guys,
let's sit down here.

00:41:26.830 --> 00:41:29.340
I wonder if we should
make better products

00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:33.880
that we could sell for better
profits to our best customers?

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:36.660
Alternatively, maybe we
should make worse products

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.260
that none of our
customers would buy

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.900
that would ruin our margins.

00:41:41.900 --> 00:41:42.907
What should we do?

00:41:42.907 --> 00:41:44.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:47.160
And it is a very,
very hard problem.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.860
And we call it the
innovator's dilemma.

00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.410
Because doing the right
thing is the wrong thing.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:55.350
And doing the wrong
thing is the right thing.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.940
Can you think about where
else you've seen this happen?

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:01.360
Where somebody comes in
with a simple product going

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:05.770
after customers who historically
couldn't have access to it

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:07.785
and then it just grew up
and killed the leaders?

00:42:10.525 --> 00:42:11.510
AUDIENCE: Blackberry.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:13.240
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: BlackBerry.

00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:19.100
Yeah, they just knocked off
sitting down with a laptop.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:24.390
And then, Apple
disrupted BlackBerry.

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.110
And now, Samsung and
Huawei are in the process

00:42:29.110 --> 00:42:32.090
of disrupting Apple.

00:42:32.090 --> 00:42:33.090
It's a good one.

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:34.760
Where else have you seen it?

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:35.816
AUDIENCE: Disc drives.

00:42:35.816 --> 00:42:37.190
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
Disc drives.

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:40.220
The big ones disrupted
by the little ones.

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:45.970
And then, the flash
disrupted disc drives.

00:42:45.970 --> 00:42:48.890
And almost all of them
are out of business now.

00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:51.110
That's a good example.

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:57.390
You guys look like you
make a lot of money.

00:42:57.390 --> 00:42:58.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:03.540
And I saw Lexus outside left
and right in the parking lot.

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.990
But that's not how Toyota
entered America, with Lexuses.

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:11.700
Toyota came in with a
rusty little sub-compact

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.080
in the 1960s called the Corona.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:20.400
And it was so much more
affordable and accessible

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:23.660
that the rebar of humanity,
people we call college

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.040
students, could own a car.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:32.510
And so, they came out here
by making it affordable.

00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:36.660
And in the backplane,
General Motors and Ford

00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:40.190
were making big
cars for big people.

00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:42.930
And people would see
Toyota coming in.

00:43:42.930 --> 00:43:47.710
And Toyota went from a Corona
to a Tercel, Corolla, Camry,

00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:52.580
Avalon, 4-Runner, Sequoia,
and then the Lexus.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:55.440
And as Toyota were
coming up there

00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:59.110
going after new
customers, they'd say,

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.970
we ought to go
get those buggers.

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:06.100
And so, they'd design
a Pinto or a Chevette

00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:11.570
and try to sell subcompacts
into the marketplace.

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:15.850
But then, their finance
people would look at the money

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:18.650
that they could
make in subcompacts

00:44:18.650 --> 00:44:20.440
with the profitability
that they could

00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:26.100
making bigger SUVs and
bigger pickup trucks

00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.310
to even bigger people.

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.760
It absolutely made
no sense to defend

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.570
the low end of the business,
when they had the opportunity

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:37.330
to make good products better.

00:44:37.330 --> 00:44:39.580
Who's killing Toyota?

00:44:39.580 --> 00:44:42.230
They don't feel like they're
getting killed, incidentally.

00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:43.730
AUDIENCE: It's
probably [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:43.730 --> 00:44:45.880
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
Yeah, the Koreans are just

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.060
killing them at the low end.

00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.460
And Toyota is doing
the right thing.

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.550
Because why would they
ever try to defend

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:54.050
the low end of
their business when

00:44:54.050 --> 00:44:57.600
they have the privilege of
competing against Mercedes

00:44:57.600 --> 00:44:58.840
at the high end?

00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.410
And then, the Chinese
manufacturers are coming next.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:05.320
And we seriously don't
need to worry about them.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:13.110
And one of the reasons
why this is so hard

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:17.840
is that what is coming
out in this dimension,

00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:21.330
in the third dimension,
is that it competes

00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:22.330
against non-consumption.

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:31.200
Because the products are so
costly and expensive that

00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.530
behind them there
are no customers.

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:37.650
They are potential
customers, but if you make

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:39.490
it affordable and accessible.

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:42.200
And so, looking
at their world, it

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.720
looks as if they're
doing just fine.

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:48.670
And it's why, almost
always, you have

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:51.960
to have a new company
with new people

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:55.080
who are looking in
the other direction.

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.500
Because you're competing against
non-consumption by making

00:45:58.500 --> 00:46:00.840
it affordable and accessible.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:04.880
And that's why growth
comes in this dimension.

00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:07.806
And almost always we find--

00:46:07.806 --> 00:46:08.722
AUDIENCE: Huh.

00:46:08.722 --> 00:46:13.000
So I guess, do you have
examples of companies

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.910
that have successfully
taken advantage

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:19.206
of this notion of disruption
where they themselves

00:46:19.206 --> 00:46:22.550
[INAUDIBLE], within their
own company, that disruption

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:23.709
to take place?

00:46:23.709 --> 00:46:25.750
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Yeah,
it's a great question.

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.450
It turns out that
there really are

00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:33.230
a few who have done that,
where they were the leaders

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.180
and, then, they became
the leader in the new wave

00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.800
without getting
killed in the old one.

00:46:39.800 --> 00:46:41.820
But only a few.

00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:44.930
And in every case,
they succeeded

00:46:44.930 --> 00:46:49.010
by setting up a completely
independent business unit

00:46:49.010 --> 00:46:54.000
and gave it able to create
a different profit formula

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.240
and develop different processes.

00:46:57.240 --> 00:47:06.980
So as a good example, IBM
just dominated the mainframe

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:08.800
business.

00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:14.330
But there were eight companies
that made mainframe computers.

00:47:14.330 --> 00:47:18.580
The other seven all got
killed when the mini-computer

00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:20.330
came in underneath.

00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:23.370
But IBM succeeded
by setting up-- they

00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:27.110
made their mainframes in
Poughkeepsie, New York.

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:28.980
And they made their
mini-computers

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:35.600
in Rochester, Minnesota.

00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.940
And there were nine companies
that made mini-computers.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.080
Only one of them,
IBM, succeeded.

00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:44.570
And they did it by setting
up a different business

00:47:44.570 --> 00:47:50.080
unit in Florida and
made them figure out

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:54.180
how to make products at
25% gross margins, instead

00:47:54.180 --> 00:47:55.976
of 40% or 60%.

00:48:02.170 --> 00:48:09.700
Hewlett-Packard did it once
when the laser printer got

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:12.820
disrupted by inkjet printer.

00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:18.050
And they set up the ink
jet separately in Vancouver

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.870
and had their own sales force.

00:48:19.870 --> 00:48:22.270
And they did very well.

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:25.070
But both of those companies
are in deep trouble now.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.310
Because they haven't
continued to follow

00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.510
that of launching disruptive
innovations and keeping

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:33.270
it separate.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:36.050
So we've had three
types of innovations,

00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:39.560
potential innovations, which
we understand by understanding

00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:43.430
the job to be done; sustaining
innovations make good products

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:49.570
better; efficiency innovations
helps us to do more with less.

00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:52.090
The role that they
have in growth

00:48:52.090 --> 00:48:55.540
is that they keep
us competitive,

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.860
but they reduce jobs.

00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.440
But they do create
free cash flow.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.940
And so Wal-Mart is an
efficiency innovation.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:09.120
The Toyota production system
is an efficiency innovation.

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:10.530
And again, they're important.

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:14.630
Because if we're not
getting more efficient,

00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:20.100
otherwise we'd get killed
sooner rather than later.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:25.590
So this is a view of
where growth comes from.

00:49:25.590 --> 00:49:29.910
So the first step is we've
got to understand the job

00:49:29.910 --> 00:49:33.270
and develop a product
that does the job well.

00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.630
And essentially, what
that does is it puts us

00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:38.980
in the center of the market.

00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:41.280
And then, disruptive
innovations make

00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:43.950
products better and accessible.

00:49:43.950 --> 00:49:46.080
So they create growth.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:49.440
Sustaining innovations
make good products better.

00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:55.090
And efficiency innovations
allow us to make more with less.

00:49:55.090 --> 00:50:04.190
And that's a manager's view
of where growth comes from.

00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:06.738
Now, why are we not
able to keep the growth?

00:50:11.090 --> 00:50:18.890
And I put the problem at
the feet of finance people

00:50:18.890 --> 00:50:23.950
who are taught finance
at places like Harvard.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:30.750
So there are two elements
that are quite important.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:35.690
One is a doctrine that they
teach in finance that we

00:50:35.690 --> 00:50:38.216
call abundance and scarcity.

00:50:38.216 --> 00:50:44.490
Now, what that means is, if
I've taken a order from you,

00:50:44.490 --> 00:50:48.090
in order to deliver what
I tell you I will offer,

00:50:48.090 --> 00:50:52.230
I have to array the
inputs required.

00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:57.540
And some of the inputs
will be costly and scarce,

00:50:57.540 --> 00:50:58.790
like platinum.

00:50:58.790 --> 00:51:01.070
And you've got to be
really careful about how

00:51:01.070 --> 00:51:03.960
you use platinum.

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:07.200
And others are abundant
and cheap, like sand.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.970
And I can waste sand.

00:51:09.970 --> 00:51:14.020
So we have to take
care of what's costly.

00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:17.230
And we can waste
what's abundant.

00:51:17.230 --> 00:51:21.160
And you'll see in
finance, historically,

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.740
we needed to carefully
husband the use of capital,

00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:30.420
because capital was
costly and scarce.

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.330
But now it's abundant and cheap.

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:34.400
And the world has
really changed on us.

00:51:38.470 --> 00:51:43.270
The second element that
finance brought to us is they

00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:48.580
decided that we should measure
our success using ratios

00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:51.440
rather than whole numbers.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.790
Now, when I studied
finance in the 1970s,

00:51:55.790 --> 00:52:01.680
we were taught finance
by whole numbers,

00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:05.750
like millions of
dollars or tons of cash.

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:14.250
But starting in the mid
1980s, shortly after,

00:52:14.250 --> 00:52:19.520
Dan [? Dricklan ?]
developed the spreadsheet,

00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.070
the analysts who grabbed
a hold of the spreadsheet

00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:28.460
started to be bothered
that, as analysts, they

00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:36.710
wanted to be able to compare
Cisco with Sun Microsystems.

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:39.630
And they're different companies.

00:52:39.630 --> 00:52:42.760
And so, if I compare
them with whole numbers,

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.070
I couldn't make much sense.

00:52:45.070 --> 00:52:49.180
But what they realized is
if they measured success

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:54.080
by ratios, then you could
compare two companies

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:56.070
that are not comparable.

00:52:56.070 --> 00:52:59.030
So if they want to
compare you with Microsoft

00:52:59.030 --> 00:53:01.820
in whole numbers,
it makes no sense.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:06.370
But in fractions, then it
commoditizes everything

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:08.980
around the denominator.

00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:14.556
So fractions-- I got back
to my fifth grade math.

00:53:14.556 --> 00:53:17.190
A ratio is a fraction.

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:20.620
It has the numerator
and a denominator.

00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:28.150
And so, if I want to grow,
there are metrics that we used.

00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:33.700
And one is return on
net assets or RONA.

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:38.460
And another one is internal
rate of return, IRR.

00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:39.870
And these are fractions.

00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:44.680
So if I'm the manager and
I want to get RONA up,

00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:49.260
sure, I could be more profitable
by being more innovative

00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:53.100
and put the profit on the
numerator of the ratio.

00:53:53.100 --> 00:53:59.490
But holy cow, if that's hard,
the denominator is assets.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:03.440
And I just have to outsource
everything to get assets off

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.240
of the denominator.

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:08.610
But either way,
improving the numerator

00:54:08.610 --> 00:54:13.420
or decreasing the
denominator, RONA goes up.

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:15.570
And it turns out
that it is easier

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:19.290
to outsource than it
is to make more profit.

00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:22.550
And so, in the pursuit
of RONA, we just

00:54:22.550 --> 00:54:25.990
outsource more
and more and more.

00:54:25.990 --> 00:54:29.930
And then, internal rate
of return is a ratio.

00:54:29.930 --> 00:54:32.250
The numerator is profit.

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:35.580
The denominator is, how
quickly do I get my money out

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:38.450
after I put my money in?

00:54:38.450 --> 00:54:41.390
And either way, the
internal rate of return

00:54:41.390 --> 00:54:46.140
improves by doing the
numerator or the denominator.

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:50.700
And because profit is harder
to achieve than to only invest

00:54:50.700 --> 00:54:53.760
in things that pay
off in the short-term,

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:56.750
more and more companies
are investing only

00:54:56.750 --> 00:55:00.700
in short-term payoff
projects, because that's

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:04.600
the way they get IRR up.

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:09.840
And so, what's happening
to us as a nation--

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:11.860
and I think you
guys temporarily are

00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:17.840
doing a good job-- is we're
losing our growth because

00:55:17.840 --> 00:55:22.870
of what finance taught us to do.

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:30.620
So just imagine that I'm making
a really good job at efficiency

00:55:30.620 --> 00:55:31.320
innovations.

00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:35.530
And that creates free cash flow.

00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:40.360
And we have so much cash that we
have to ask analysts to tell us

00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.740
where we should put our money.

00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:49.062
So the analysts will look
at that disruptive history.

00:55:49.062 --> 00:55:51.340
And they say, we
ought to use our money

00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:54.710
to create disruptive companies.

00:55:54.710 --> 00:55:59.220
But the problem is, if we
invest in disruptive companies,

00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:01.470
they pay off in
five to 10 years.

00:56:01.470 --> 00:56:03.686
And so internal rate
of return will tank.

00:56:06.630 --> 00:56:10.160
And if we start to create
disruptive companies,

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:15.250
we'll have to put assets back
onto their balance sheet.

00:56:15.250 --> 00:56:20.840
On the other hand,
if we use our money

00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.080
to do another round of
efficiency innovations,

00:56:24.080 --> 00:56:28.210
they pay off in six
months to three years.

00:56:28.210 --> 00:56:29.150
There is no risk.

00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:30.670
The market is there.

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:33.570
It creates free cash flow.

00:56:33.570 --> 00:56:36.810
So if you wouldn't mind just
this once, what I'd like to do

00:56:36.810 --> 00:56:40.390
is use our money to do
another round of efficiency

00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:42.320
innovations.

00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:44.310
And I do that.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:47.976
And the problem is, we
have more free cash flow.

00:56:47.976 --> 00:56:49.350
And we've got to
figure out, what

00:56:49.350 --> 00:56:51.920
do we do with all of this stuff?

00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:54.370
So can we look at
the analyst, say,

00:56:54.370 --> 00:57:00.270
just take another deeper look
at disruptive innovations.

00:57:00.270 --> 00:57:01.930
And so, he does.

00:57:01.930 --> 00:57:06.200
And he said, the problems
are just the same.

00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:08.820
If we invest to create
disruptive products,

00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:15.600
they pay off in five to 10 years
and IRRs are going to go down.

00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.900
And RONA goes down,
because it needs assets.

00:57:17.900 --> 00:57:21.270
So if you wouldn't
mind, I'd like

00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.620
to just use our money
just one more time

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.680
to do another round of
efficiency innovations.

00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:31.130
And the problem is, it
creates more capital.

00:57:31.130 --> 00:57:33.560
What are we going to do
with all this capital?

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.880
My gosh!

00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.410
And so, I just do it
again and again and again.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:42.110
And that's what's
happened in our economies

00:57:42.110 --> 00:57:49.810
in Japan and Europe and,
increasingly, in North America.

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:52.760
Because we have chosen
to measure success

00:57:52.760 --> 00:58:01.240
with these ratios, our analysts
grab that free cash flow

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.990
and use it to create
more free cash flow.

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:06.770
And if you want to know what's
going to happen to America,

00:58:06.770 --> 00:58:09.140
just look at Japan.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:15.470
Because in the '60s, '70s,
and most of the '80s,

00:58:15.470 --> 00:58:20.060
Japan's economy was growing
at unprecedented rates.

00:58:20.060 --> 00:58:22.540
And the reason why
they were growing

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:25.630
was because they had
companies in that economy that

00:58:25.630 --> 00:58:29.510
kept investing in
disruptive innovations.

00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:33.720
So Toyota made cars
affordable for mankind.

00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:39.200
Honda made motorcycles
affordable for mankind.

00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:49.970
Sony made a 10-transistor pocket
radio that allowed teenagers

00:58:49.970 --> 00:58:52.490
to listen to rock-and-roll.

00:58:52.490 --> 00:58:55.970
And the reason why
you guys have printers

00:58:55.970 --> 00:59:01.620
in your offices and your homes
is that Canon disrupted Xerox.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:04.950
But because they made things
affordable and accessible,

00:59:04.950 --> 00:59:07.300
billions of people
around the world

00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.430
were able to own and use
things that historically

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:13.590
had been beyond their reach.

00:59:13.590 --> 00:59:18.800
And that forced these companies
to make more products.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.860
And that meant that they
had to hire more people

00:59:20.860 --> 00:59:24.510
to make them and distribute them
and sell them and service them.

00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:29.080
And for 30 years, they had
no economic recessions.

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.930
They had no unemployment,
because they

00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:34.970
were going after people
who were competing

00:59:34.970 --> 00:59:37.380
against non-consumption.

00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.880
And in the late 1980s,
the analysts in Japan

00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.770
started to measure their
success as gross margins

00:59:46.770 --> 00:59:51.740
and net present values and
internal rates of return.

00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:55.550
And since 1990, in
Japan, they have not yet

00:59:55.550 --> 01:00:00.460
generated a single new
disruptive innovation.

01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.030
And their economy
just went "ppt."

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:07.330
It's been flat-lined
for 25 years.

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:11.580
And they have
capital everywhere.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:14.060
And the cost of
capital is nearly $0.

01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:17.220
And yet, they can't grow,
because of the metrics

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:19.280
that they have chosen.

01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:24.670
And that's what I worry a
lot for the United States.

01:00:24.670 --> 01:00:29.250
Increasingly, the
financial analysts

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:33.690
are causing us to use our
capital to create capital.

01:00:33.690 --> 01:00:36.830
And the cost of
capital is nearly $0.

01:00:36.830 --> 01:00:41.960
And yet, most companies aren't
organized to invest to grow.

01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:44.990
And you guys are doing
a good job temporarily.

01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:46.960
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.650
Anyway, those are just
a few of the thoughts

01:00:49.650 --> 01:00:51.880
that we have about
where growth comes from

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:55.130
and how to deal with it.

01:00:55.130 --> 01:00:56.770
AUDIENCE: So for a
company like Google,

01:00:56.770 --> 01:00:59.900
what metrics would you
suggest to break out

01:00:59.900 --> 01:01:02.460
of this vicious cycle?

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:04.950
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
Well, there is no metric

01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:12.690
that any analyst has developed
or is motivated to develop.

01:01:12.690 --> 01:01:20.560
So there are analysts,
like Moody's and S&amp;P--

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.020
any indicator that they
have is very short-term.

01:01:26.020 --> 01:01:29.430
They have their metrics about
this year and next year.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:30.800
But that's it.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:34.180
And we don't have a metric
that will allow an analyst

01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:38.080
to say, for this company,
10 years from now,

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:40.780
they are going to
be in great shape.

01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.470
Because these are the products
that they have in the pipeline.

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:49.390
And so, you guys have
to develop your own.

01:01:49.390 --> 01:01:55.730
It turns out that God didn't
tell us to use those metrics.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.470
Somebody decided to
use those metrics.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:00.900
But it wasn't God who told us.

01:02:00.900 --> 01:02:04.080
And so, we ought to
then say to those--

01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:09.890
whoever it was that told us
the metrics-- screw you guys.

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:13.060
Here's the metric by which
we want to be analyzed.

01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:14.840
It's a great question.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.030
Yes?

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:19.676
AUDIENCE: So you opened talking
about how the labor force takes

01:02:19.676 --> 01:02:21.050
a long time to
come back and it's

01:02:21.050 --> 01:02:23.310
because people are investing
in the things that give you

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:24.393
more capital efficiencies.

01:02:24.393 --> 01:02:26.460
And one of the ones that
I think is the bigger

01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:28.080
investment that you
see here at Google

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.300
is artificial intelligence.

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:30.830
So if you look at
humanity as a job

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.780
to be done, before the
Industrial Revolution

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.370
you had to get
things built or made.

01:02:35.370 --> 01:02:37.935
And human muscles were
a good way to do that.

01:02:37.935 --> 01:02:41.720
And this decade, we're
looking at, the job to be done

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:44.462
is people need to think about
things and solve problems.

01:02:44.462 --> 01:02:46.170
And human brains are
pretty good at that.

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.190
But now, AI is coming.

01:02:47.190 --> 01:02:47.740
It's cheaper.

01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:49.190
It's more scalable.

01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:51.260
What are going to be
the jobs that humans can

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.190
do after this AI revolution.

01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:55.480
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:58.820
So these are just
a couple of things

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:03.000
that I worry about
in that initiative.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:19.010
So we might think, by
analogy, a driverless car

01:03:19.010 --> 01:03:23.430
as a technology is a
complicated problem.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:30.120
If we are targeting
the California freeway

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:37.020
as the application
for a driverless car,

01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:43.020
that is a very
complicated application.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:46.530
And there are all kinds of
legal issues that are just--

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.700
and the technology needs
to be pretty sophisticated.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.640
And maybe that'll happen.

01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.450
Maybe it won't.

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:58.530
But we don't think
about, if we change

01:03:58.530 --> 01:04:01.200
this, what are all of
the other things that

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:05.310
need to change in order
to enable this technology

01:04:05.310 --> 01:04:07.000
to develop?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.180
And so, our theory says
that where you ought to look

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:14.750
is on a farm.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:21.130
And John Deere has wireless
tractors going up and down.

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.770
And the application
is very simple.

01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:28.910
And almost always,
when you try to make

01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:31.140
it affordable and
accessible, you

01:04:31.140 --> 01:04:33.830
start with very
simple applications

01:04:33.830 --> 01:04:37.460
and then, little by
little, do that on.

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:40.020
But competing with
non-consumption

01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:41.870
is really critical.

01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:47.160
And so, AI-- what
I worry about is,

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:49.470
although we think
that it will make

01:04:49.470 --> 01:04:56.440
us be able to be better
thinkers at lower cost,

01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:58.920
I worry that the
applications of these

01:04:58.920 --> 01:05:01.910
are actually quite complicated.

01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:03.820
And that we don't
think about, what

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:07.400
are all of the other things
that have to occur in order to

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.280
for our piece to make it?

01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.430
And so, it could be a big thing.

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:16.300
But I'd bet that,
in the process,

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:20.980
we'll realize that we should
go after simple applications.

01:05:20.980 --> 01:05:27.440
And that typically forces
us to hire more people.

01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.090
But it's a good one.

01:05:29.090 --> 01:05:32.200
Because whether you call
it an efficiency innovation

01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:35.140
or a disruptive innovation
makes a big differences

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.700
as to the outcome.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:38.572
Thanks.

01:05:38.572 --> 01:05:40.627
AUDIENCE: I just want to
say, thanks for coming.

01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:43.210
Reading your book was actually
one of the reasons I did my MBA

01:05:43.210 --> 01:05:43.890
and ended up here.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:44.210
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Oh geez.

01:05:44.210 --> 01:05:46.780
AUDIENCE: So you had a pretty
tangible effect on my life.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:46.930
But--

01:05:46.930 --> 01:05:48.471
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
Oh, you're kind.

01:05:48.471 --> 01:05:50.662
AUDIENCE: So I want to see
if you could help clarify

01:05:50.662 --> 01:05:52.620
the way that we talk
about disruption in regard

01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.050
to the technology itself.

01:05:54.050 --> 01:05:56.190
And we have a couple of
technologies at Google

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:58.300
that could be considered--
that are often

01:05:58.300 --> 01:06:02.060
called disruptive technologies,
artificial intelligence,

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:05.970
machine learning, which is very
much being built internally

01:06:05.970 --> 01:06:06.940
to the organization.

01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.790
It's helping improve
what we do as a company

01:06:08.790 --> 01:06:12.040
and could be seen as a
sustaining innovation.

01:06:12.040 --> 01:06:13.950
And then, we have
autonomous cars,

01:06:13.950 --> 01:06:16.970
which are being treated--
built at X, external-- much

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:19.120
more in line with
the disruptive model.

01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:21.729
So is it the technology
that's a disruption?

01:06:21.729 --> 01:06:23.520
Or is it the application
of the technology?

01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:27.209
Is it the market effect
that makes it disruptive?

01:06:27.209 --> 01:06:28.250
What is it disruptive to?

01:06:28.250 --> 01:06:30.375
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Yeah,
that's a great question.

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:33.390
It's actually really
important for you

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.500
to say what you just said.

01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:42.130
Because in many ways, I made a
mistake calling the phenomena

01:06:42.130 --> 01:06:45.070
disruptive disruptive.

01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.370
Because there are so many
connotations of the word

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:48.930
disruptive in the
English language.

01:06:48.930 --> 01:06:50.650
And so, there are
a lot of people

01:06:50.650 --> 01:06:55.000
who call anything that
is a dramatic improvement

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:59.610
or a breakthrough--
we call it disruptive.

01:06:59.610 --> 01:07:01.530
And that's not true.

01:07:01.530 --> 01:07:05.470
So almost always, disruption
is built within the business

01:07:05.470 --> 01:07:14.070
model of the enterprise, not by
developing the best technology.

01:07:14.070 --> 01:07:17.300
Because typically, you
can take a technology

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:20.210
and deploy it onto
the California freeway

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:25.700
or on a corn field in Iowa.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:29.820
And how you deploy it
determines it's disruptiveness.

01:07:29.820 --> 01:07:32.336
And that's really an
important one to do.

01:07:32.336 --> 01:07:39.450
And people say that I'm a
Jewish mother of business

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:43.190
in that I'm always
worried about everything.

01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:45.280
But I worry about you guys.

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.750
Because I think
that you are very

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:53.480
good at developing potentially
disruptive innovations.

01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.990
But I don't think
you worry nearly

01:07:56.990 --> 01:08:00.350
enough about the
business models that you

01:08:00.350 --> 01:08:03.220
have to build that
would then take

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:07.031
your technology into an
application that competes

01:08:07.031 --> 01:08:08.030
against non-consumption.

01:08:10.630 --> 01:08:13.470
And I think that's a
very important concept.

01:08:13.470 --> 01:08:16.547
And I don't think I'm
totally wrong about that.

01:08:16.547 --> 01:08:18.880
AUDIENCE: So I also want to
start by praising your book.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.210
I think it's the best
book I've ever read.

01:08:20.210 --> 01:08:22.251
And it's hard to think of
something else that has

01:08:22.251 --> 01:08:23.460
impacted how I think as much.

01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:23.959
But--

01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:25.340
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
You're kind.

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:26.584
You have low standards, but--

01:08:26.584 --> 01:08:27.084
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:27.084 --> 01:08:28.329
AUDIENCE: You think so?

01:08:28.329 --> 01:08:29.370
Well, here comes the but.

01:08:29.370 --> 01:08:31.130
So I've been wondering
this for a little while.

01:08:31.130 --> 01:08:32.830
But how do you explain
certain products

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:36.170
that have transformed industries
and up-ended incumbents

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:38.594
but don't fit into the
framework of low-end disruption?

01:08:38.594 --> 01:08:42.790
So off the top of my
head, Uber, iPhone, Tesla,

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.890
all started from the
very, very highest end

01:08:44.890 --> 01:08:46.950
of the market and trickle
downwards from there.

01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:48.033
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Yeah.

01:08:48.033 --> 01:08:53.130
Well, let's take them one at
a time, because those are all

01:08:53.130 --> 01:08:57.180
really good examples.

01:08:57.180 --> 01:09:03.060
So the theory would
say that Tesla is

01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:05.790
a sustaining innovation, right?

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:09.229
So they come in at the
high end of the market.

01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:13.430
And they're deploying it in
a very demanding application,

01:09:13.430 --> 01:09:17.010
which is the California freeway.

01:09:17.010 --> 01:09:19.979
And what the theory
says is that they

01:09:19.979 --> 01:09:22.649
might be able to
develop the product that

01:09:22.649 --> 01:09:24.779
is the best in the world.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:29.340
But if they go after the
best customers of the leaders

01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:33.680
up there, these guys are going
to harness whatever they can.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.600
And they will do their
best to knock them out.

01:09:36.600 --> 01:09:39.470
Or they will acquire them.

01:09:39.470 --> 01:09:43.450
So in a lot of ways, you
could think of disruption

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:47.189
as a theory of
competitive response.

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:51.660
If I do this, what will
the competitors do?

01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:55.840
And when Toyota came in
with the simple product,

01:09:55.840 --> 01:10:02.260
the theory predicts that
Detroit will just ignore them.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:06.220
And so, what's
happened is, yes, Tesla

01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.510
is the best with
the best product.

01:10:09.510 --> 01:10:12.990
But Porsche has spent
$1 billion dollars.

01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:17.550
And they have a completely
electric car now.

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:22.450
And you can just smell
BMW all around them.

01:10:22.450 --> 01:10:25.570
And so, the theory
might be wrong.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:29.210
But the theory would say that
these other guys are either

01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:33.620
going to kill Tesla
or acquire them.

01:10:33.620 --> 01:10:35.480
And that's what it would be.

01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:47.160
But just like a $100,000 Porsche
has not transformed the world,

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.280
a electric car at that
price point actually won't.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.160
And that's what the theory says.

01:10:55.160 --> 01:11:00.820
And Christine and I were
in Beijing four weeks ago,

01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:03.140
walking down the road.

01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:08.920
And here is this electric
car that was as wide as me.

01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:12.380
And if I had a passenger I
had to fold her up and put it

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:15.870
in the boot.

01:11:15.870 --> 01:11:19.500
And it cost $2,500.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:25.240
And that's where I think the
transforming technology will

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:25.895
come from.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:37.070
Apple-- there are a
couple of answers to that.

01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:40.610
But what allowed
them to survive when

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:49.440
they came in at the high end
of the wireless phone market,

01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:58.920
is they came in to
disrupt the laptop.

01:11:58.920 --> 01:12:01.650
And they have
disrupted the laptop.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.320
And that's why they
have succeeded.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:07.190
If they had stayed
and simply tried

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:13.870
to compete against BlackBerry--
they had the benefit

01:12:13.870 --> 01:12:20.960
for a while of-- the BlackBerry
had an architecture that was

01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:24.130
excruciatingly interdependent.

01:12:24.130 --> 01:12:28.190
And so, you couldn't
develop apps for it.

01:12:28.190 --> 01:12:33.820
And then, Apple came
up with-- internally,

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.150
it's interdependent.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:41.960
But there was a standard port,
so apps could be developed.

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:45.860
And that blew BlackBerry
out of the water.

01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:55.500
But then, the Android operating
system and Huawei and Samsung

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.790
are just killing Apple.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:03.660
Because they're being disruptive
in the conventional way.

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:09.210
So on average, I think we can
understand why it's happening.

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:13.300
But sometimes, it takes a few
years rather than a few months.

01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:15.157
AUDIENCE: So what about Uber?

01:13:15.157 --> 01:13:16.240
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Yeah.

01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:18.580
AUDIENCE: The incumbent's
not going to acquire Uber.

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:19.996
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
That's right.

01:13:19.996 --> 01:13:26.710
And it taught me a lot
about the theory with Uber.

01:13:26.710 --> 01:13:28.540
So it is true.

01:13:28.540 --> 01:13:30.220
Well, first, they
came up and they

01:13:30.220 --> 01:13:34.150
disrupted the black sedans.

01:13:34.150 --> 01:13:36.340
And that's unambiguous.

01:13:36.340 --> 01:13:38.080
But then, they came
down and they're

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.350
making a better
product than the taxis

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:43.530
at roughly the same price.

01:13:43.530 --> 01:13:46.330
And they've blown
them out of the water.

01:13:46.330 --> 01:13:47.900
They didn't come
in at the bottom.

01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:50.620
And what we realized
is that there

01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:52.750
is a correlation
between their coming

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:58.000
at the bottom of the market and
being successful as disruptors.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:07.400
But the reason why that's
correlative not causal

01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:12.260
is, you look at the
business model of Uber,

01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:16.270
and the taxi is very
asset intensive.

01:14:16.270 --> 01:14:19.730
They own the car
and the medallion.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:24.180
And their costs are
fixed cost intensive.

01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.540
And they just had to have
these taxis on the road 24/7

01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.750
in order to make money.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:36.660
And the Uber business model
is they have no assets.

01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.120
And their costs are all
variable, not fixed.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.180
And the taxis actually just
can't get there from here.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:48.670
And so, in our
thinking, we've decided

01:14:48.670 --> 01:14:52.790
that we don't want to say they
always start at the low end.

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:55.990
But they have to
develop a business model

01:14:55.990 --> 01:14:59.570
where the incumbents just
can't get there from here.

01:14:59.570 --> 01:15:02.200
And that's what
makes it disruptive.

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.617
So I learned a lot from that.

01:15:03.617 --> 01:15:04.450
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:15:04.450 --> 01:15:05.950
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
You're welcome.

01:15:05.950 --> 01:15:07.120
Thank you.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.690
MATT: All right, I'm going
to read one from the Dory.

01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:13.980
What did you notice in your own
life or the world around you

01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:17.240
that inspired you to write "How
will you Measure your Life?"

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:19.560
And how can companies
and institutions

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:22.700
help their employees approach
measuring their lives

01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.960
in a better way?

01:15:23.960 --> 01:15:25.770
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN: Wow.

01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:29.240
Thank you for your question.

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.100
We're hitting at 3 o'clock.

01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.530
So can I answer this one?

01:15:32.530 --> 01:15:35.354
And for you guys, can
we just talk afterwards.

01:15:35.354 --> 01:15:36.520
I'm sorry to do that to you.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:37.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sounds good.

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:39.920
CLAYTON CHRISTENSEN:
So why we wrote

01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.420
this book about how
you measure your life

01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:50.340
is just I described here how
the metrics that they were using

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:58.480
caused them to spend their
time and energy in developing--

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.640
they did not intend to do
what they actually did.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:07.840
And what I realized
is why they so

01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:11.640
invested in things
that cause them to fail

01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:13.930
wasn't that they were stupid.

01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:17.330
But the resource
allocation process--

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:21.950
the metrics caused them to
put their money in a direction

01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:25.000
that they did not
intend to pursue.

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:33.350
So anyway, where I worked at
the Harvard Business School,

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:36.220
the core competence of the
Harvard Business School

01:16:36.220 --> 01:16:40.506
is we are really good at soaking
our alumni for donations.

01:16:40.506 --> 01:16:41.850
[LAUGHTER]

01:16:42.750 --> 01:16:45.090
And so, every five
years, we invite

01:16:45.090 --> 01:16:48.280
all of our alumni to come back.

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:52.810
And we remember them to
please bring their wallets.

01:16:52.810 --> 01:16:56.110
And we're really good at this.

01:16:56.110 --> 01:16:59.340
So because Christine and
I have lived in Boston

01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:02.290
ever since I
graduated, we've gone

01:17:02.290 --> 01:17:06.990
to all of these 5,
10, 15-year reunions.

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:11.940
And I remember when we came
back for our fifth reunion.

01:17:11.940 --> 01:17:13.770
Oh my gosh!

01:17:13.770 --> 01:17:15.830
Most of my friends
had married people

01:17:15.830 --> 01:17:18.860
who were much better looking
than my friends were.

01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:21.450
They had kids that
were well-behaved.

01:17:21.450 --> 01:17:24.160
And their jobs were going well.

01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:27.580
And just everything that
we imagined would be true

01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:31.590
was unfolding as we thought.

01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:35.440
But then, I noticed
for the 10th reunion,

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.010
gosh, a lot of people who I
was looking forward to seeing

01:17:39.010 --> 01:17:41.010
didn't show up.

01:17:41.010 --> 01:17:45.400
And when I asked common
friends, where is so-and-so?

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:48.450
More often than I ever
imagined the answer

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:52.850
was that he's in the
middle of an awful divorce

01:17:52.850 --> 01:17:55.630
and he just doesn't
want to talk about it.

01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:59.510
And for the 15th reunion,
there were even fewer people.

01:17:59.510 --> 01:18:02.360
And when I'd ask about
them, more often it

01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:08.860
was not, it's he's in an
awful divorce or their spouse

01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.360
remarried and now they're
raising their children

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:13.650
on the other side
of the country.

01:18:13.650 --> 01:18:16.830
And they just don't want to
talk to anybody about what life

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:20.050
had turned out the wrong way.

01:18:20.050 --> 01:18:23.320
And then, by the 20th
and the 25th reunions,

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:26.550
it was really scary.

01:18:26.550 --> 01:18:29.310
And it was the same problem.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:32.450
I can tell you with
perfect certainty

01:18:32.450 --> 01:18:35.250
that not a single
one of my classmates

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:39.110
when we graduated
from Harvard planned

01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:43.480
to go out and raise
children who hate their guts

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:47.590
and get divorced one
or two or three times.

01:18:47.590 --> 01:18:51.750
Our intention was to
create homes where

01:18:51.750 --> 01:18:53.800
there was happiness there.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.400
And it was a source of happiness
for the rest of our lives.

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.700
But that was what
we intend to do.

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.750
And how we spent
our time and energy

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:04.840
was just the opposite of that.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.660
And the reason why is
the very same thing.

01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.630
It's the metrics.

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:14.790
So those of us who are
driven to achievement--

01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:18.380
that includes at
least 100% of us--

01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:21.750
when we have that
need for achievement,

01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:24.880
then, when we have an
extra 30 minutes of time

01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:28.270
or an ounce of energy,
we instinctively

01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:31.960
spend our time and energy
on whatever activities

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:35.110
will give us the most
immediate and tangible evidence

01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:37.400
of achievement.

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:40.640
And our careers provide that.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:47.560
So every day at work, I ship
a product, I finish a project,

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.220
I get promoted, I get paid,
we close another deal.

01:19:53.220 --> 01:19:57.090
And every day, I get immediate
and tangible evidence

01:19:57.090 --> 01:19:59.520
of achievement at work.

01:19:59.520 --> 01:20:03.040
And then, when I walk
into the front door,

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:05.230
there's not a lot of
evidence of achievement

01:20:05.230 --> 01:20:07.320
when you look at your kids.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:11.850
On a day-to-day basis,
they misbehave every day.

01:20:11.850 --> 01:20:15.420
The place gets
cluttered every day.

01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.900
And it really is not
until 20 years down

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.860
the road when you're
able to look at your kids

01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:24.700
and put your hands on your
hips and say, my gosh,

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:28.890
we created a wonderful
young man or woman.

01:20:28.890 --> 01:20:33.960
But on the day-to-day basis,
there's no evidence of that.

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:40.260
And as a result of that, we
invest our time and energy

01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:43.760
in our careers and
under-invest in our children

01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:47.270
and our spouses,
even though we plan

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:50.190
to have that be the
source of energy.

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:54.490
And so, that's why I decided
I would write that book, "How

01:20:54.490 --> 01:20:56.330
Will You Measure Your Life?"

01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:57.190
Anyway--

01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.940
