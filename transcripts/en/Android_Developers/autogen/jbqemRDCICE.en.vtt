really great game to show off all that

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:36.270
really great game to show off all that
 

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:39.020
really great game to show off all that
you can do with an antigen title we're

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:39.030
you can do with an antigen title we're
 

00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:41.690
you can do with an antigen title we're
seeing all sorts of translation and

00:13:41.690 --> 00:13:41.700
seeing all sorts of translation and
 

00:13:41.700 --> 00:13:45.590
seeing all sorts of translation and
rotation you know you know zoom on all

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:45.600
rotation you know you know zoom on all
 

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:46.970
rotation you know you know zoom on all
these different sprite objects and you

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:46.980
these different sprite objects and you
 

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:48.170
these different sprite objects and you
can see it's really keeping up

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:48.180
can see it's really keeping up
 

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.290
can see it's really keeping up
wonderfully well and an engine is uh is

00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300
wonderfully well and an engine is uh is
 

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.630
wonderfully well and an engine is uh is
written against dalvik so this is not a

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:53.640
written against dalvik so this is not a
 

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:56.330
written against dalvik so this is not a
native application and but this is using

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:56.340
native application and but this is using
 

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:59.630
native application and but this is using
GL right so you affect that any affine

00:13:59.630 --> 00:13:59.640
GL right so you affect that any affine
 

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.040
GL right so you affect that any affine
transformation on the sprites isn't

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.050
transformation on the sprites isn't
 

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.450
transformation on the sprites isn't
going to be a problem absolutely

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:02.460
going to be a problem absolutely
 

00:14:02.460 --> 00:14:04.130
going to be a problem absolutely
question is how many objects can get on

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:04.140
question is how many objects can get on
 

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:05.990
question is how many objects can get on
the screen and it's actually quite a few

00:14:05.990 --> 00:14:06.000
the screen and it's actually quite a few
 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.970
the screen and it's actually quite a few
yeah I mean there's there's no problem

00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:07.980
yeah I mean there's there's no problem
 

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.460
yeah I mean there's there's no problem
on a device like the transformer prime

00:14:10.460 --> 00:14:10.470
on a device like the transformer prime
 

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:12.110
on a device like the transformer prime
so you know it does a lot of people say

00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120
so you know it does a lot of people say
 

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.540
so you know it does a lot of people say
hey do I have to write my game you know

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:14.550
hey do I have to write my game you know
 

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:17.030
hey do I have to write my game you know
using you know the native stuff and the

00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:17.040
using you know the native stuff and the
 

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:18.680
using you know the native stuff and the
answer is really know for a lot of

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:18.690
answer is really know for a lot of
 

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:20.930
answer is really know for a lot of
things you know the main reason why

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:20.940
things you know the main reason why
 

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.310
things you know the main reason why
people do it is honestly for

00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320
people do it is honestly for
 

00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.710
people do it is honestly for
compatibility so that so they can poured

00:14:24.710 --> 00:14:24.720
compatibility so that so they can poured
 

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.360
compatibility so that so they can poured
it over to platforms that don't have our

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:26.370
it over to platforms that don't have our
 

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.060
it over to platforms that don't have our
cool support for tools but on you know

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:29.070
cool support for tools but on you know
 

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:30.920
cool support for tools but on you know
if you're if you're not you know

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:30.930
if you're if you're not you know
 

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.270
if you're if you're not you know
concerned about that there are some

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:32.280
concerned about that there are some
 

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:34.640
concerned about that there are some
really great solutions out there and an

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:34.650
really great solutions out there and an
 

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:36.350
really great solutions out there and an
engine is just getting been getting more

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360
engine is just getting been getting more
 

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.650
engine is just getting been getting more
rich and robust as a time is gone time

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:39.660
rich and robust as a time is gone time
 

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:41.690
rich and robust as a time is gone time
has gone by so it's cool to see this and

00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:41.700
has gone by so it's cool to see this and
 

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:42.950
has gone by so it's cool to see this and
that's slowed down by the way is

00:14:42.950 --> 00:14:42.960
that's slowed down by the way is
 

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.150
that's slowed down by the way is
actually because I picked up a powerup

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160
actually because I picked up a powerup
 

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:46.580
actually because I picked up a powerup
that's not actually that's not actually

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:46.590
that's not actually that's not actually
 

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:49.610
that's not actually that's not actually
slowed down because of the game so you

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620
slowed down because of the game so you
 

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:51.200
slowed down because of the game so you
can see it's worked it's a really fun I

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.210
can see it's worked it's a really fun I
 

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:52.190
can see it's worked it's a really fun I
mean they've done they've done a really

00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:52.200
mean they've done they've done a really
 

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.690
mean they've done they've done a really
really good job I'll show you one thing

00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:53.700
really good job I'll show you one thing
 

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.400
really good job I'll show you one thing
however that that they should have

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:55.410
however that that they should have
 

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.890
however that that they should have
changed and that is with handling of the

00:14:57.890 --> 00:14:57.900
changed and that is with handling of the
 

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.450
changed and that is with handling of the
back key first of all the game pauses

00:14:59.450 --> 00:14:59.460
back key first of all the game pauses
 

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.190
back key first of all the game pauses
whenever you whenever you Reese whenever

00:15:01.190 --> 00:15:01.200
whenever you whenever you Reese whenever
 

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.660
whenever you whenever you Reese whenever
you lift up your finger which is which

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:02.670
you lift up your finger which is which
 

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:05.300
you lift up your finger which is which
is interesting and then I can't help but

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.310
is interesting and then I can't help but
 

00:15:05.310 --> 00:15:07.790
is interesting and then I can't help but
notice but it has a sideways restart

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800
notice but it has a sideways restart
 

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.470
notice but it has a sideways restart
button is that

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480
button is that
 

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.250
button is that
intended yeah artifact the hdmi god no

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:12.260
intended yeah artifact the hdmi god no
 

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.410
intended yeah artifact the hdmi god no
it's not it's kind of a weird artifact

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:14.420
it's not it's kind of a weird artifact
 

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.740
it's not it's kind of a weird artifact
the game I don't know why they do that I

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:16.750
the game I don't know why they do that I
 

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.590
the game I don't know why they do that I
because the game is being rendered in in

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600
because the game is being rendered in in
 

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.699
because the game is being rendered in in
portrait mode you can see the buttons

00:15:21.699 --> 00:15:21.709
portrait mode you can see the buttons
 

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:23.319
portrait mode you can see the buttons
are at the bottom so it's kind of odd to

00:15:23.319 --> 00:15:23.329
are at the bottom so it's kind of odd to
 

00:15:23.329 --> 00:15:24.910
are at the bottom so it's kind of odd to
have that there was forced into portrait

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:24.920
have that there was forced into portrait
 

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.259
have that there was forced into portrait
mode yeah actually that's what I mean

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:26.269
mode yeah actually that's what I mean
 

00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:27.460
mode yeah actually that's what I mean
it's being forced into ports but I mean

00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:27.470
it's being forced into ports but I mean
 

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.720
it's being forced into ports but I mean
it's not like the game is rendering in

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:28.730
it's not like the game is rendering in
 

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:30.610
it's not like the game is rendering in
landscape it against a portrait screen

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.620
landscape it against a portrait screen
 

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:32.889
landscape it against a portrait screen
this is really a true portrait game so

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:32.899
this is really a true portrait game so
 

00:15:32.899 --> 00:15:34.240
this is really a true portrait game so
it was a little surprising to see that

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:34.250
it was a little surprising to see that
 

00:15:34.250 --> 00:15:35.710
it was a little surprising to see that
I'll say the other thing that they do is

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720
I'll say the other thing that they do is
 

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.540
I'll say the other thing that they do is
that you actually the back button quit

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:37.550
that you actually the back button quit
 

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:39.699
that you actually the back button quit
progress will be lost first of all why

00:15:39.699 --> 00:15:39.709
progress will be lost first of all why
 

00:15:39.709 --> 00:15:41.290
progress will be lost first of all why
are you losing progress want to hit the

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:41.300
are you losing progress want to hit the
 

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.449
are you losing progress want to hit the
back key you know is it really really

00:15:43.449 --> 00:15:43.459
back key you know is it really really
 

00:15:43.459 --> 00:15:45.879
back key you know is it really really
necessary can't we just like restart off

00:15:45.879 --> 00:15:45.889
necessary can't we just like restart off
 

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:46.990
necessary can't we just like restart off
in the middle and the fact is these

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:47.000
in the middle and the fact is these
 

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.840
in the middle and the fact is these
levels are freaking long you know it

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:49.850
levels are freaking long you know it
 

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.610
levels are freaking long you know it
takes it takes minutes and minutes to

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:51.620
takes it takes minutes and minutes to
 

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.199
takes it takes minutes and minutes to
play through a level in mobile gamers

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:53.209
play through a level in mobile gamers
 

00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:54.519
play through a level in mobile gamers
you know they want to play for five

00:15:54.519 --> 00:15:54.529
you know they want to play for five
 

00:15:54.529 --> 00:15:55.960
you know they want to play for five
minutes and then they want to go off and

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:55.970
minutes and then they want to go off and
 

00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:57.699
minutes and then they want to go off and
do whatever they're doing it's very

00:15:57.699 --> 00:15:57.709
do whatever they're doing it's very
 

00:15:57.709 --> 00:15:59.110
do whatever they're doing it's very
difficult in this game so if I had

00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120
difficult in this game so if I had
 

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:01.000
difficult in this game so if I had
anything in a comment that i would say

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.010
anything in a comment that i would say
 

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:03.879
anything in a comment that i would say
please allow someone to really give them

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:03.889
please allow someone to really give them
 

00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:05.290
please allow someone to really give them
the appeal feeling that they can leave

00:16:05.290 --> 00:16:05.300
the appeal feeling that they can leave
 

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:06.939
the appeal feeling that they can leave
the game in the middle a level and come

00:16:06.939 --> 00:16:06.949
the game in the middle a level and come
 

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:08.139
the game in the middle a level and come
back and if you do go to the home screen

00:16:08.139 --> 00:16:08.149
back and if you do go to the home screen
 

00:16:08.149 --> 00:16:09.939
back and if you do go to the home screen
that does happen but there's no reason

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:09.949
that does happen but there's no reason
 

00:16:09.949 --> 00:16:13.480
that does happen but there's no reason
the same thing wouldn't happen on a back

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:13.490
the same thing wouldn't happen on a back
 

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:15.400
the same thing wouldn't happen on a back
transition the second thing is now that

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:15.410
transition the second thing is now that
 

00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:18.400
transition the second thing is now that
we're here at this yes and no prompt you

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:18.410
we're here at this yes and no prompt you
 

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.720
we're here at this yes and no prompt you
can't actually at the back you get rid

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:19.730
can't actually at the back you get rid
 

00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:21.579
can't actually at the back you get rid
of it you know we are now absolutely

00:16:21.579 --> 00:16:21.589
of it you know we are now absolutely
 

00:16:21.589 --> 00:16:24.370
of it you know we are now absolutely
stuck in the we're not actually handling

00:16:24.370 --> 00:16:24.380
stuck in the we're not actually handling
 

00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:25.750
stuck in the we're not actually handling
the back key in this incident back so

00:16:25.750 --> 00:16:25.760
the back key in this incident back so
 

00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:27.639
the back key in this incident back so
you should always dismiss the dialog

00:16:27.639 --> 00:16:27.649
you should always dismiss the dialog
 

00:16:27.649 --> 00:16:29.139
you should always dismiss the dialog
yeah it should always it should always

00:16:29.139 --> 00:16:29.149
yeah it should always it should always
 

00:16:29.149 --> 00:16:30.550
yeah it should always it should always
do something you know something it

do something you know something it
 

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.079
do something you know something it
actually changes the stage of things

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:32.089

just you have to architect it and design

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680
just you have to architect it and design
 

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.439

it into the game as much as possible so

00:17:05.439 --> 00:17:05.449
it into the game as much as possible so
 

00:17:05.449 --> 00:17:07.059

yeah because otherwise you know you're
 

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:09.039
yeah because otherwise you know you're
really just designing your game for the

know and so you know if you look at the
 

00:17:31.159 --> 00:17:32.560
know and so you know if you look at the
actual game itself if I go back and

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:32.570
actual game itself if I go back and
 

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.350

click on the game and go back into it

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:34.360
click on the game and go back into it
 

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.029

just need making sure that that the fact
 

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.580
just need making sure that that the fact
that it can do that is bubbled up to the

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:42.590
that it can do that is bubbled up to the
 

00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:44.080
that it can do that is bubbled up to the
user in as many ways as possible just

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:44.090
user in as many ways as possible just
 

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.210

why yeah all right so anyway yeah I
point is that I've worked on these games

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:16.990
point is that I've worked on these games
 

00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:19.559
point is that I've worked on these games
I I think this is a very professional I

00:38:19.559 --> 00:38:19.569
I I think this is a very professional I
 

00:38:19.569 --> 00:38:21.420
I I think this is a very professional I
mean there's you know obviously if you

00:38:21.420 --> 00:38:21.430
mean there's you know obviously if you
 

00:38:21.430 --> 00:38:25.200
mean there's you know obviously if you
were on a massive you know pc or xbox

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:25.210
were on a massive you know pc or xbox
 

00:38:25.210 --> 00:38:28.559
were on a massive you know pc or xbox
360 playstation 3 um you know you

00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:28.569
360 playstation 3 um you know you
 

00:38:28.569 --> 00:38:29.849
360 playstation 3 um you know you
probably be doing a lot more than this

00:38:29.849 --> 00:38:29.859
probably be doing a lot more than this
 

00:38:29.859 --> 00:38:31.620
probably be doing a lot more than this
but just all of the animation and the

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:31.630
but just all of the animation and the
 

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:33.240
but just all of the animation and the
way the graphics have been done is

00:38:33.240 --> 00:38:33.250
way the graphics have been done is
 

00:38:33.250 --> 00:38:35.640
way the graphics have been done is
really high quality the only objection

00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:35.650
really high quality the only objection
 

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:37.559
really high quality the only objection
that i have is they were not authorized

00:38:37.559 --> 00:38:37.569
that i have is they were not authorized
 

00:38:37.569 --> 00:38:42.180
that i have is they were not authorized
for a 720p screen they're just a little

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:42.190
for a 720p screen they're just a little
 

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.499
for a 720p screen they're just a little
bit grainy I think you can probably see

00:38:43.499 --> 00:38:43.509
bit grainy I think you can probably see
 

00:38:43.509 --> 00:38:45.359
bit grainy I think you can probably see
that on your screen you've just got a

00:38:45.359 --> 00:38:45.369
that on your screen you've just got a
 

00:38:45.369 --> 00:38:48.720
that on your screen you've just got a
little bit of stretching there but this

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:48.730
little bit of stretching there but this
 

00:38:48.730 --> 00:38:50.700
little bit of stretching there but this
also shows that even even with just a

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:50.710
also shows that even even with just a
 

00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:52.410
also shows that even even with just a
you know if you there is a little bit of

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:52.420
you know if you there is a little bit of
 

00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:53.819
you know if you there is a little bit of
stretching like the difference between

00:38:53.819 --> 00:38:53.829
stretching like the difference between
 

00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:56.430
stretching like the difference between
this game you know I showing a full

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:56.440
this game you know I showing a full
 

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.920
this game you know I showing a full
screen display you know with a little

00:38:58.920 --> 00:38:58.930
screen display you know with a little
 

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:00.210
screen display you know with a little
bit of stretching because the assets

00:39:00.210 --> 00:39:00.220
bit of stretching because the assets
 

00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:02.700
bit of stretching because the assets
aren't exactly the right size and for

00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:02.710
aren't exactly the right size and for
 

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.319
aren't exactly the right size and for
example showing the game compressed and

00:39:04.319 --> 00:39:04.329
example showing the game compressed and
 

00:39:04.329 --> 00:39:05.940
example showing the game compressed and
with giant black borders around all

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:05.950
with giant black borders around all
 

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:07.680
with giant black borders around all
sides is you know i mean this is this is

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:07.690
sides is you know i mean this is this is
 

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:08.310
sides is you know i mean this is this is
you know

00:39:08.310 --> 00:39:08.320
you know
 

00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.020
you know
definitely definitely superior to that

00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.030
definitely definitely superior to that
 

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:12.660
definitely definitely superior to that
and and so you know you know you know

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:12.670
and and so you know you know you know
 

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:14.910
and and so you know you know you know
even though it kind of shows that you

00:39:14.910 --> 00:39:14.920
even though it kind of shows that you
 

00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:16.290
even though it kind of shows that you
know the most important thing is to make

00:39:16.290 --> 00:39:16.300
know the most important thing is to make
 

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.850
know the most important thing is to make
sure you're designing for aspect ratios

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:17.860
sure you're designing for aspect ratios
 

00:39:17.860 --> 00:39:20.220
sure you're designing for aspect ratios
and it's great to have a really high

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:20.230
and it's great to have a really high
 

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.930
and it's great to have a really high
resolution art assets but you can get

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:21.940
resolution art assets but you can get
 

00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.370
resolution art assets but you can get
away with a little bit of it in here

00:39:23.370 --> 00:39:23.380
away with a little bit of it in here
 

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:25.740
away with a little bit of it in here
this is you can and I think and I think

00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:25.750
this is you can and I think and I think
 

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:27.000
this is you can and I think and I think
that you know you can try to figure out

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:27.010
that you know you can try to figure out
 

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.650
that you know you can try to figure out
where your target is you know I mean

00:39:28.650 --> 00:39:28.660
where your target is you know I mean
 

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:29.940
where your target is you know I mean
they're going to be you know eventually

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:29.950
they're going to be you know eventually
 

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:31.890
they're going to be you know eventually
devices that are going to be super super

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:31.900
devices that are going to be super super
 

00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:34.410
devices that are going to be super super
high resolution we've got xhdpi you know

00:39:34.410 --> 00:39:34.420
high resolution we've got xhdpi you know
 

00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:37.440
high resolution we've got xhdpi you know
and so and and and so when those devices

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:37.450
and so and and and so when those devices
 

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:38.760
and so and and and so when those devices
ship you know there are there is going

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:38.770
ship you know there are there is going
 

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:39.990
ship you know there are there is going
to be need for higher art but you know

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:40.000
to be need for higher art but you know
 

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.100
to be need for higher art but you know
there's always going to be some sort of

00:39:41.100 --> 00:39:41.110
there's always going to be some sort of
 

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:42.480
there's always going to be some sort of
point of you know it just doesn't make

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:42.490
point of you know it just doesn't make
 

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:44.520
point of you know it just doesn't make
much difference anymore right and now

00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:44.530
much difference anymore right and now
 

00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:45.450
much difference anymore right and now
you know this game I think has a

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:45.460
you know this game I think has a
 

00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:46.710
you know this game I think has a
presentation it looks good enough as it

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720
presentation it looks good enough as it
 

00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.330
presentation it looks good enough as it
is it's beautiful i'm really impressed

by it yeah hit the back button again it
 

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:53.160
by it yeah hit the back button again it
just misses that perfect now what

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:53.170
just misses that perfect now what
 

00:39:53.170 --> 00:39:58.140
just misses that perfect now what
happens when I skip to the end okay I

00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:58.150
happens when I skip to the end okay I
 

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:00.240
happens when I skip to the end okay I
hit the back button here nothing happens

the previous screen well also also from
a point from a point of the game is is I

00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:37.270
a point from a point of the game is is I
 

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:39.300
a point from a point of the game is is I
expect wanting at the back key that I'm

00:40:39.300 --> 00:40:39.310
expect wanting at the back key that I'm
 

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:41.190
expect wanting at the back key that I'm
gonna be allowed to exit now the truth

00:40:41.190 --> 00:40:41.200

stuff i would actually assume that if i

00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:44.530
stuff i would actually assume that if i
 

00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:46.080
stuff i would actually assume that if i
hit the back key at this point i would

00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:46.090
hit the back key at this point i would
 

00:40:46.090 --> 00:40:49.170
hit the back key at this point i would
go straight here yeah you know and I

00:40:49.170 --> 00:40:49.180
go straight here yeah you know and I
 

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.520
go straight here yeah you know and I
could just go back to the main I would

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:50.530
could just go back to the main I would
 

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:51.840
could just go back to the main I would
go back to their menu that's that's

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:51.850
go back to their menu that's that's
 

00:40:51.850 --> 00:40:53.190

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.120
about that that's what would make sense
i think that you know that being said

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:56.130
i think that you know that being said
 

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.400
i think that you know that being said
because you might lose that internet

00:40:59.400 --> 00:40:59.410
because you might lose that internet
 

00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:01.260
because you might lose that internet
context you might say you might pop up

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:01.270

something inside would you like to

00:41:02.610 --> 00:41:02.620
something inside would you like to
 

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.410
something inside would you like to
return to the main menu because there

00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:04.420
return to the main menu because there
 

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.970
return to the main menu because there
are options are only available there and

00:41:05.970 --> 00:41:05.980
are options are only available there and
 

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:08.550

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:10.600
principle of least disruption when it
 

00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:12.570
principle of least disruption when it
comes to the back key so i would say

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:12.580
comes to the back key so i would say
 

00:41:12.580 --> 00:41:14.400
comes to the back key so i would say
that would be reasonable to me but i

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:14.410
that would be reasonable to me but i
 

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:16.110
that would be reasonable to me but i
think it should definitely go back here

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:16.120
think it should definitely go back here
 

00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.820
think it should definitely go back here

so are are are actually pretty
 

00:48:06.910 --> 00:48:11.010
so are are are actually pretty
straightforwardly easy and now our study

00:48:11.010 --> 00:48:11.020
straightforwardly easy and now our study
 

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:12.599
straightforwardly easy and now our study
super stuff we have to use one of these

00:48:12.599 --> 00:48:12.609
super stuff we have to use one of these
 

00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:16.049
super stuff we have to use one of these
that is available on the side over there

00:48:16.049 --> 00:48:16.059
that is available on the side over there
 

00:48:16.059 --> 00:48:18.480
that is available on the side over there
and I've got it now I've got to use two

00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:18.490
and I've got it now I've got to use two
 

00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:19.950
and I've got it now I've got to use two
of these you get you actually lose

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:19.960
of these you get you actually lose
 

00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.359
of these you get you actually lose
points i think for using the ones on the

00:48:21.359 --> 00:48:21.369
points i think for using the ones on the
 

00:48:21.369 --> 00:48:23.339
points i think for using the ones on the
side instead of using the ones that are

00:48:23.339 --> 00:48:23.349
side instead of using the ones that are
 

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:25.799
side instead of using the ones that are
on the screen as you can see if you have

00:48:25.799 --> 00:48:25.809
on the screen as you can see if you have
 

00:48:25.809 --> 00:48:27.450
on the screen as you can see if you have
a point you can't make a move and this

00:48:27.450 --> 00:48:27.460
a point you can't make a move and this
 

00:48:27.460 --> 00:48:29.130
a point you can't make a move and this
all completely fills up you lose the

00:48:29.130 --> 00:48:29.140
all completely fills up you lose the
 

00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:32.069
all completely fills up you lose the
round so i'm going to make it this time

00:48:32.069 --> 00:48:32.079
round so i'm going to make it this time
 

00:48:32.079 --> 00:48:34.470
round so i'm going to make it this time
but just barely as long as I'm fast

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:34.480
but just barely as long as I'm fast
 

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:38.130
but just barely as long as I'm fast
enough and what oh I had to have that

00:48:38.130 --> 00:48:38.140
enough and what oh I had to have that
 

00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:39.720
enough and what oh I had to have that

the back key here and it has other than
some you know missing grammar well you

00:51:12.490 --> 00:51:12.500
some you know missing grammar well you
 

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:13.750
some you know missing grammar well you
know it actually does something quite

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:13.760
know it actually does something quite
 

00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.100
know it actually does something quite
reasonable i hit the back again it goes

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:15.110
reasonable i hit the back again it goes
 

00:51:15.110 --> 00:51:16.270
reasonable i hit the back again it goes
away that's good it looks like a

00:51:16.270 --> 00:51:16.280
away that's good it looks like a
 

00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.120
away that's good it looks like a
dialogue that makes sense now i would

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:19.130
dialogue that makes sense now i would
 

00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:20.650
dialogue that makes sense now i would
much rather for this kind of game just

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:20.660
much rather for this kind of game just
 

00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:22.690

actually just go back to the main menu

00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:24.590
actually just go back to the main menu
 

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:26.230
actually just go back to the main menu
and let me continue like there should

00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240
and let me continue like there should
 

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.700
and let me continue like there should
just be a big old button there this is

00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:27.710
just be a big old button there this is
 

00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:28.900
just be a big old button there this is
continuing there should never be a

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:28.910
continuing there should never be a
 

00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:30.910
continuing there should never be a
pop-up that says that I mean really like

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920
pop-up that says that I mean really like
 

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.800
pop-up that says that I mean really like
especially especially since I'm not

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:32.810
especially especially since I'm not
 

00:51:32.810 --> 00:51:34.570
especially especially since I'm not
really playing against people now I was

00:51:34.570 --> 00:51:34.580
really playing against people now I was
 

00:51:34.580 --> 00:51:35.890
really playing against people now I was
really playing against people there was

00:51:35.890 --> 00:51:35.900
really playing against people there was
 

00:51:35.900 --> 00:51:37.540
really playing against people there was
some network or some local connection

00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:37.550
some network or some local connection
 

00:51:37.550 --> 00:51:39.400
some network or some local connection
that might be broken that's actually one

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:39.410
that might be broken that's actually one
 

00:51:39.410 --> 00:51:40.570
that might be broken that's actually one
of those rare cases in which it is

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:40.580
of those rare cases in which it is
 

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.910
of those rare cases in which it is
really very reasonable to have a pop-up

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:42.920
really very reasonable to have a pop-up
 

00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:45.160
really very reasonable to have a pop-up
like that you know if I'm actually like

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:45.170
like that you know if I'm actually like
 

00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:46.630
like that you know if I'm actually like
tearing down a network connection or

00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640
tearing down a network connection or
 

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.490
tearing down a network connection or
something like that you know I can and

00:51:48.490 --> 00:51:48.500
something like that you know I can and
 

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.110
something like that you know I can and
and other people might might believe

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:50.120
and other people might might believe
 

00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.760
and other people might might believe
that I'm going to lose progress now once

00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:51.770
that I'm going to lose progress now once
 

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:54.550
that I'm going to lose progress now once
again there's two pieces of progress

00:51:54.550 --> 00:51:54.560
again there's two pieces of progress
 

00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:55.840
again there's two pieces of progress
that we really care about you using

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:55.850
that we really care about you using
 

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:59.050
that we really care about you using
there's progress in the game and there's

00:51:59.050 --> 00:51:59.060
there's progress in the game and there's
 

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:03.340
there's progress in the game and there's
parts in terms of time so if I'm going

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:03.350
parts in terms of time so if I'm going
 

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:04.900
parts in terms of time so if I'm going
to have to replay a section of the game

00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:04.910
to have to replay a section of the game
 

00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:06.670
to have to replay a section of the game
or if I'm going to have to wait for

00:52:06.670 --> 00:52:06.680
or if I'm going to have to wait for
 

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:09.160
or if I'm going to have to wait for
something to load then it's fine to pop

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:09.170
something to load then it's fine to pop
 

00:52:09.170 --> 00:52:11.230
something to load then it's fine to pop
up a notification and make somebody

00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240
up a notification and make somebody
 

00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:13.390
up a notification and make somebody
confirm that they really want to go back

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400
confirm that they really want to go back
 

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.190
confirm that they really want to go back
otherwise it should just happen again

00:52:18.190 --> 00:52:18.200
otherwise it should just happen again
 

00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.540
otherwise it should just happen again
you know that again we wanted to make

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:19.550
you know that again we wanted to make
 

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:20.830
you know that again we wanted to make
sure is that you know what a game gets

00:52:20.830 --> 00:52:20.840
sure is that you know what a game gets
 

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.450
