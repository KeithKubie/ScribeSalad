00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.136
Opposers, the NRA
is silent no more.

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.174
Today NRA chief Wayne LaPierre
or in English Wayne 'The' Pierre

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:10.410
responded to the shooting
in Parkland.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:14.680
As usual, the opportunists
wasted not one second

00:00:14.713 --> 00:00:17.550
to exploit tragedy
for political gain.

00:00:17.583 --> 00:00:19.852
They hide behind labels

00:00:19.885 --> 00:00:22.155
like democrat to make their
socialist agenda

00:00:23.622 --> 00:00:25.291
more palatable, palatable,
palatable, palatable.

00:00:25.324 --> 00:00:30.229
Evil walks
among us and God help us

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:33.900
if we don't harden our schools
and protect our kids.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:35.902
That's right, NRA.
Evil walks

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.970
among us. The socialist pinkos

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:40.573
want to have a conversation
about gun control

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:43.409
are leaving our kids exposed.

00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:46.579
Pure evil.
But don't panic opposers.

00:00:46.612 --> 00:00:49.349
Luckily we have one
narrow bit of hope.

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.684
Control of the presidency

00:00:51.717 --> 00:00:54.620
and the House and the Senate
and the judiciary

00:00:54.653 --> 00:00:57.523
and two thirds of governorships
and state legislatures

00:00:57.556 --> 00:00:59.826
and 98 percent of all
Cracker Barrel franchises.

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:03.996
Can you imagine if we didn't?
Then they come for our handguns,

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:06.399
our AR-15s, our Remington R-25s,

00:01:06.432 --> 00:01:09.569
our glock-22s, our BB guns,
our BB8s. Before you know it,

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.137
Hillary is president
and your Cracker Barrel

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.872
is a Planned Parenthood
giving out free abortion

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:14.107
with every pecan pancake!

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.109
Are you scared? Good.

00:01:16.642 --> 00:01:18.078
Maybe you should go
and buy a gun.
