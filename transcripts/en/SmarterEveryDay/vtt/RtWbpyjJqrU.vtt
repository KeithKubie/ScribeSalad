00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.320
Hey it's me Destin

00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.520
Welcome back to SmarterEveryDay

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.700
So you've probably observed that cats

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.380
almost always land on their feet

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.660
Today's question is why.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:09.160
 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.560
Like most simple questions there's a very complex answer

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.600
For instance let me reword this question

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:15.660
How does a cat go from feet up

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:17.280
To feet down

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.500
In a falling reference frame without violating the conservation of angular momentum

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.980
Now I've studied free falling bodies, my own in fact

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.020
in several different environments and once i get my angular rotation started

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.800
in one direction, I can't stop it.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.260
Today, we're going to use a high speed camera- we're not going to use Alley

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.660
because this is my daughter's cat, i don't want to hurt it-

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.800
we're going to use a stunt cat

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.300
let me introduce you to Gi-Gi

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.060
the stunt cat

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.240
(music)

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.980
I'll just flip the uh, the video vertical

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.120
and then motion track the cat

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.360
it's just going to take a lot more effort in post

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.900
We're going to try to do it in a way that doesn't make anybody mad

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.860
That's pretty hard to do.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.080
You gotta drop the cat

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.840
Ready Gi-Gi?

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.560
Good kitty

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.640
Checking out the high speed data there Gi-Gi?

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.140
Ok the first thing a cat does when it's falling is try to figure out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.100
which way is up.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.240
It does this either with the gyro in the ear

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.200
or with its eyes

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.480
Ready to talk cat physics?

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.560
Alright. So check out this footage i captured with the Phantom Miro

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.340
While Gi-Gi goes to get a drink of water.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.600
So here's what's interesting about this to me.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.460
You'll notice that at the beginning of the drop the cat

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.840
is not rotating

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.220
halfway through the drop the cat is rotating

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.020
and at the very end Gi-Gi somehow stopped rotating

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.040
Newton's law says an object at rest will stay at rest

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.800
unless acted on by an external force

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.100
I see no external forces on this cat

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.440
So what's happening here?

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.200
It's not making sense to me

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.500
O.K. so in order to really get the right data

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.460
we're going to have to drop her 90 degrees out of phase.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.480
Atta girl

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.260
This time watch her tail

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.880
3

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.880
2

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.700
