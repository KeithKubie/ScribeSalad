00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:11.530
By the way, everyone has the license to disobey
political correctness.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.289
I feel that everything is about good taste
and self-restraint.

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:22.890
My favorite comedian of all time is Richard
Pryor so I'm not a prude, but I think some

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.289
things maybe you can say more eloquently.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.720
Some things you can say in a way that if you're
intelligent you'll pick up on it, and if you

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.690
won't, you don't.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:43.109
Subtleties, nuance—that's what gets lost
in the whole big battle of political correctness.

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.129
I don't believe in any political correctness.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:51.440
I don't think even if I'm talking about like,
you say to me, “Who's your favorite comedian,”

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.030
or, “Who do you think is up and coming,”
and I name two male comedians, that does not

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.981
mean that I think female comedians aren't
funny or I don't have a favorite female, it

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:05.670
just means in that moment I thought of those
two people.

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.460
Yet there are people who will have a strong
opinion on that moment.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.650
They would write underneath on the comments:
“Why aren't you talking about the funny

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:18.770
women?”

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.520
Just because I didn’t!

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.180
I didn't make a blanket statement!

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.790
So political correctness is wrong, is super
ignorant—super ignorant—and super partisan.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.860
Let me tell you something: I'm not a centrist.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.460
I'm not right.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.990
I consider myself a liberal, but not a lefty
if that makes sense.

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.141
I'm liberal-minded in that I'll vote for anyone
who is a good human being, whether they're

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:52.530
from the Green Party, Democratic Party, Republican
Party.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.890
For me it's about humanity.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.890
And partisanship?

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.670
I’ve got to tell you, I read everything
on the Internet and just as many liberals

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.320
are as annoying as right-wing people.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.009
They're all annoying, everyone with this,
“Be like me or you're wrong.”

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:17.250
People used to make a decision; they'd see
something and they'd decide if it was true

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.250
or not.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.910
Now they base truths on their own truth.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:29.420
“I see what I believe as opposed to I'm
trying to believe what I see.”

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.740
But even the term of fake news—fuck that.

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.810
Fuck fake news.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250
Fuck all these terms because they're only
terms that are used by the douche bags.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.980
They're not terms—I'm not saying you're
a douche bag for saying it, it was a question—but

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.810
the point being is: do you think I live my
day reading all sorts of material from the

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.260
Washington Post to the National Review if
I'm interested, whatever it is, do you think

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.530
that any of it I look at and go, "Well that's
fake news, fake news.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:59.560
What about fake news?"

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.260
I think these are just words that are thrown
at us, they're words that are currently in

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260
the lexicon.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.670
They'll be gone.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.410
It all changes, man.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:09.420
It does.
