this is a virus that causes bird flu

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:06.060
this is a virus that causes bird flu
 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.140
this is a virus that causes bird flu
there's a real pilot ality connected

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150
there's a real pilot ality connected
 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.459
there's a real pilot ality connected
with h5n1 virus and we haven't got a

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469
with h5n1 virus and we haven't got a
 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.670
with h5n1 virus and we haven't got a
vaccine for it yet that's a very

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680
vaccine for it yet that's a very
 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.870
vaccine for it yet that's a very
ubiquitous and we don't have a medicines

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880
ubiquitous and we don't have a medicines
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.019
ubiquitous and we don't have a medicines
that really will treat it and over

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
that really will treat it and over
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.210
that really will treat it and over
almost fifty five percent of the people

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220
almost fifty five percent of the people
 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.890
almost fifty five percent of the people
that have come down with h5n1 flu have

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900
that have come down with h5n1 flu have
 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.530
that have come down with h5n1 flu have
died and this could be very very serious

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540
died and this could be very very serious
 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.500
died and this could be very very serious
to our world if in fact this virus

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510
to our world if in fact this virus
 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.750
to our world if in fact this virus
mutates enough to to be able to be

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760
mutates enough to to be able to be
 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.240
mutates enough to to be able to be
transmitted from human to human so far

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
transmitted from human to human so far
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.970
transmitted from human to human so far
it has not been able to be transmitted

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980
it has not been able to be transmitted
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.750
it has not been able to be transmitted
very readily from you to me or from you

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760
very readily from you to me or from you
 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.970
very readily from you to me or from you
to your wife or girlfriend whatever the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980
to your wife or girlfriend whatever the
 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.630
to your wife or girlfriend whatever the
case may be and that is saved us but it

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640
case may be and that is saved us but it
 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209
case may be and that is saved us but it
continues to mutate and still lurking

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
continues to mutate and still lurking
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.689
continues to mutate and still lurking
out there and that's the biggest concern

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699
out there and that's the biggest concern
 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.820
out there and that's the biggest concern
that we have in the healthcare field

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830
that we have in the healthcare field
 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.020
that we have in the healthcare field
that somehow this h5n1 virus will mutate

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030
that somehow this h5n1 virus will mutate
 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.120
that somehow this h5n1 virus will mutate
so that's easily transmitted from human

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130
so that's easily transmitted from human
 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.789
so that's easily transmitted from human
human and we will have a huge problem on

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799
human and we will have a huge problem on
 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.100
human and we will have a huge problem on
our hands the second big one is the fact

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110
our hands the second big one is the fact
 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.109
our hands the second big one is the fact
that we have so many bacteria that is in

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119
that we have so many bacteria that is in
 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570
that we have so many bacteria that is in
that drug that is really drug resistance

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580
that drug that is really drug resistance
 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.440
that drug that is really drug resistance
verses 1 and so on and so forth that and

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
verses 1 and so on and so forth that and
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.069
verses 1 and so on and so forth that and
we're getting staph infections in the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079
we're getting staph infections in the
 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.830
we're getting staph infections in the
hospital and and TB that's very hard to

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840
hospital and and TB that's very hard to
 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.859
hospital and and TB that's very hard to
kill or cure from the old drugs we have

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869
kill or cure from the old drugs we have
 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.160
kill or cure from the old drugs we have
they're not as powerful enough those

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170
they're not as powerful enough those
 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.560
they're not as powerful enough those
those viruses mutated enough for

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
those viruses mutated enough for
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.330
those viruses mutated enough for
bacteria has changed enough so that the

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340
bacteria has changed enough so that the
 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.359
bacteria has changed enough so that the
things that we have are not capable of

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369
things that we have are not capable of
 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.490
things that we have are not capable of
killing them

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500
killing them
 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.430
killing them
for their spreading
