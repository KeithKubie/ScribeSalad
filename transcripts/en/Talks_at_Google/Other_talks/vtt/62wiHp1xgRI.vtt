ANTHONY CAPORALE: First of all,
I want to thank you so

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:03.630
much for having me in today.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:04.770
I'm really excited.

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.610
I am a huge, dyed-in-the-wool,
honest to gpd Google fanatic.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:10.980
I'm a Gmail guy.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.320
I'm an Android guy.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.150
I live and die by all
of your products.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.550
So I really, really appreciate
the opportunity to come in and

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.190
talk to you today.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.320
Thank you so much.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.000
My name's Anthony Caporale.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.640
And I'm going to be talking
about whisky, if that's OK.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.860
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.264
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:27.140
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Great.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.360
So, we had a couple things I
want to talk to you about in

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.040
the whisky category.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.870
But I'm really going to end
up focusing on scotch.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.130
Because that's kind
of my love.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.700
And to me, it's one of the more
interesting of the whisky

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.390
categories.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.200
But I'm going to cover as
much of whisky as I can.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.660
Just a little bit about myself
so you kind of know who this

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.130
person is who's going
to be yapping at you

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.130
for the next 60 minutes.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.640
Come on in, come on
in, come on in.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.490
I've been doing this
for over 20 years.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:58.050
I started as a bartender about
20 years ago and then moved

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.210
into training.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.070
Bought a restaurant.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:00.800
Sold a restaurant.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.310
I've been teaching
for a long time.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:04.800
I've worked for some really,
really cool people in the

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.830
industry, including
Bobby Flay.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.610
I'm currently the brand
ambassador for Drambuie scotch

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.160
liqueur, which we will be
tasting at the TGIAF.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:16.590
Right?

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.420
At 5 o'clock.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.150
So we're going to go right
from here upstairs.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.740
And I have all my
boys upstairs.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.780
And we're going to be tasting
some really, really cool

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.880
Drambuie cocktails.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.080
But before we do that,
I want to teach you

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.400
about whisky and scotch.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.220
So, first thing.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.470
What is whisky?

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.990
Whisky is a huge category
right now.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.800
Whisky is experiencing a boom
the likes of which if most

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.200
companies were experiencing
this boom, we

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.360
would want to be invested.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.050
Just the bourbon category--

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.980
to give you an idea, bourbon
is up 17% year over, just

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.960
bourbon alone.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.330
They can't make enough
bourbon.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.360
You guys have recently probably
followed the Maker's

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.280
Mark fiasco where they had to
water down Maker's Mark in

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.070
order to meet demand.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.090
And then they said no,
no, no, we're not

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.880
actually going to do that.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.580
Because people hated
them, right?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.766
So whisky is a huge, huge
category, but what it?

00:02:06.766 --> 00:02:07.920
What is whisky?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.550
We're not as familiar with
whisky as we once

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.410
were in this country.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.490
Before prohibition, most of the
spirits we drank in this

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.840
country were whisky.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.560
They were dark spirits.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.670
At its most basic, basic level,
whisky is a distilled

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.230
alcoholic beverage made from
fermented grains--

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.680
that's really important--

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.940
and aged in wooden casks.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.160
So that really, that last part,
aged in wooden casks,

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.160
that's the money.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.050
That's what makes
whisky whisky.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.890
So you start with
a grain product.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.010
You ferment it.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.080
You distill it.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.700
And then you age it in wood.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:47.620
Anything that you do that
follows those basic guidelines

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.150
falls into the whisky
category.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.820
It comes from the Old English
word usquebaugh.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.415
Everyone say usquebaugh
with me.

00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:57.240
AUDIENCE: Usquebaugh.

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.720
ANTHONY CAPORALE: It's fun.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.040
It's a fun word to say.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280
So, usquebaugh means
water of life.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.530
And the reason that I bring that
up is because it shows

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.420
the importance that whisky
has had over time.

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.850
People literally put whisky on
the same level, in terms of

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.430
importance, as water,
and even more so.

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.120
Because back in the day, 1200,
1300, back before there were

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.940
clean municipal water supplies
when we were in the Old World

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.880
in Europe, if you drink the
water from the river, you were

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.640
going to get sick.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.430
And you were probably
going to die.

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:28.910
Because this is how
it worked, folks.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.410
You would go to the river, and
you would take your water.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.740
You'd bring it back
to your house.

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.510
You'd clean with it.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:34.680
You'd bathe with it.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.970
You'd cook with it.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.260
You'd do bodily functions
with the water.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.520
Then you'd dump it out into
the curb, into the gutter.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.370
And it would run back
into the river.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.710
Great system, unless you lived
downstream from that city.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.510
Because then the water you were
pulling out of the river

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.370
was all of their waste water.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.610
Right?

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.350
So what happened was fermented
beverages and distilled

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.420
beverages-- beverages with
alcohol in them-- turned out

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.730
to be much healthier and much
safer to drink than water.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.110
People who drank
water got sick.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.020
People who drank beer, wine,
cider, whisky did not.

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.300
All right?

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.070
So water of life, usquebaugh.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.830
Really, really important to kind
of put this in context.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.800
Types of whisky.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.940
We have scotch whisky,
obviously.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.380
We have Irish whisky.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:21.470
Bourbon is a type of whisky.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.810
Rye, Canadian, Japanese.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.040
Many, many countries today
are making their

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.980
own forms of whisky.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:31.810
But I want you to know that
scotch isn't its own thing.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.040
Scotch is scotch whisky.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.290
Bourbon isn't its own thing.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.770
Bourbon is bourbon whisky.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.440
So all these things are grain
spirits that have been

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.850
fermented, distilled,
and aged in wood.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:44.410
All right?

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.270
We see some spelling
variations.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.720
You've probably noticed this.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.460
Traditionally, without
the E is used

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.730
for Scotch and Canadian.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.420
With the E is used for pretty
much everything else.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.320
Whisky was probably invented
in Ireland.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.740
However, the Scotch were the
first people to write down a

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.780
definition for whisky.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.730
So they kind of get
credit for it.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.220
So we think probably the Irish
invented it, but they were too

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.230
busy drinking it in order to
write down what it was.

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:11.480
So we gave it to the Scotch.

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.950
Couple of things about the
category of whisky.

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.910
UK, cereal grain mash.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:24.760
I'm going to get a little
geeky with you guys.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.800
Because I understand
there are a lot of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:26.530
engineers in the room.

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.300
I actually have a mechanical
engineering degree.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.420
So later on, we're going to get
a little geekier than I

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:31.240
sometimes get.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.490
But distillation to less than
95% ABV, I'm going to talk

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:37.350
about the significance of that
in a minute when I do my

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.530
distillation demo.

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.890
Aging in oak casks--

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.540
and it has to be bottled at
not less than 80 proof.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.920
All right?

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.592
80 proof is what percent
alcohol?

00:05:48.592 --> 00:05:48.930
AUDIENCE: 40.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:49.390
ANTHONY CAPORALE: 40.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.690
Right.

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.210
You take the proof, you cut it
in half, and you end up with

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.220
the percent alcohol.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.060
I'll talk about that
in just a second.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.770
So before we get into whisky and
what it is, I want to talk

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.890
to you a little bit about
alcohol itself.

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:02.860
Because alcohol is the
active ingredient.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.180
Alcohol is what makes
whisky whisky.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:06.610
And the alcohol we're
talking about is

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.000
ethyl alcohol or ethanol.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.300
It's volatile.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.810
All right?

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.370
That means it evaporates
easily.

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:13.220
It's flammable.

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.940
It burns.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.920
Colorless, and it is a liquid.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.770
It's a central nervous system
depressant with significant

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.850
psychoactive effects.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:23.250
That means it makes us want to
dance and sing karaoke and

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.120
hang out with people
in parties.

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.000
That's why we like it.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.770
It's also toxic in relatively
small quantities.

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.120
That's just about
one half of 1%.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.630
All right?

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:36.140
So this is why we kind
of got to be careful.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:40.360
It is made through the
fermentation of sugar.

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.090
That's the only way that we
make ethyl alcohol, folks.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.100
It's not made in the
lab somewhere.

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.640
Dow Chemical doesn't
produce it.

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.660
It's may through the
fermentation of sugar.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.880
Who here is a home brewer?

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:51.930
Do I have any home brewers?

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:52.720
Yes!

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.070
Awesome.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.330
You make beer, wine, cider?

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.610
AUDIENCE: Beer.

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.220
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Beer?

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.780
Pretty easy to make
beer, right?

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:57.182
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:06:57.182 --> 00:06:58.390
Just keep it sanitized.

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:00.010
ANTHONY CAPORALE: That's-- it's
difficult to make beer

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.350
taste good.

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:03.560
It's easy to actually
make beer.

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.060
I'm going to show you how easy
it is to make beer right now.

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:12.800
I have, in here, a mixture
of honey and warm water.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.280
Pretty simple.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.000
I have in here a yeast slurry.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.470
And that's just yeast that's
been dissolved in warm water,

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:25.890
just to activate the yeast.

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.820
And all I'm going to do is
pour this yeast into this

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.320
honey, and we're going to watch
and see what happens.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:38.200
Yeast is a unicellular
microorganism.

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.330
It's basically a plant.

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.700
It's the most common organism
on the planet.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:45.550
We're all breathing yeast
cells right now.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.710
They're all over the place.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.780
And yeast only does
one thing, folks.

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:51.740
Yeast consumes sugar.

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:56.090
And it excretes alcohol
and carbon dioxide.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.330
That's what yeast does.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:03.990
So if I have a solution with
alcohol and carbon dioxide in

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:08.230
it after the yeast has done its
thing, what do we drink

00:08:08.230 --> 00:08:11.120
every Friday afternoon at
about 5 o'clock that's

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:16.016
basically water with alcohol
and carbon dioxide?

00:08:16.016 --> 00:08:16.490
AUDIENCE: Beer.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:17.120
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Beer.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.030
Exactly.

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:20.840
So this is where we got
beer from, right?

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.900
So as we watch, we're going to
see a nice cap of carbon

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:28.080
dioxide form as this yeast
starts to convert the sugar in

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.770
the honey into ethyl alcohol
and carbon dioxide.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:34.970
And that's fermentation in
its most basic form.

00:08:34.970 --> 00:08:38.400
And that is where we
get ethyl alcohol.

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:40.659
Before we move on, I do want to
talk to you quickly about

00:08:40.659 --> 00:08:42.110
the proof system in the US.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.420
Because that's how we
measure alcohol by

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.230
volume, ABV, for spirits.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.700
Spirit is liquors.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.150
So we all know that, as I
mentioned, if we have 80 proof

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.770
and we want to convert that to
ABV, alcohol by volume, you

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.840
cut it in half.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:59.490
And there's an interesting
story behind that.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:03.690
Back in the day, we taxed
spirituous liquors.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.510
We taxed things like vodka,
gin, rum, tequila.

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:11.890
But we didn't know if the tax
man came to your house and

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:15.660
wanted to tax your moonshine, he
couldn't necessarily prove

00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:17.980
that it was moonshine
instead of water.

00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:19.990
You could sit there all day and
argue that it was water.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.560
And he would say no,
it's moonshine.

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.670
So what he would do is he would
take some of the liquid

00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:24.180
in question.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.640
He would put it in a little
spoon, and light it.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:33.080
Now, as it happens, a mixture of
alcohol and water will burn

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.150
as long as there is at least 50%
alcohol in that mixture.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:39.360
So he would light it.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:42.330
If it lit, he would tax you.

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.820
Because it was at least
50% alcohol.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:50.710
And the phrase became, 50%
alcohol, 100% proven that it

00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:52.040
was taxable.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.280
OK?

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.970
So that's where that
comes from.

00:09:53.970 --> 00:09:55.870
And that way you'll always kind
of remember the math.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.840
So cut the proof in half,
and you get the ABV.

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:03.830
We're actually starting to
measure spirits just by ABV

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.190
now because those tax laws
no longer apply.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:09.580
And all we care about is how
much alcohol's in the bottle.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:11.830
So pretty much all the spirits
that you're going to see now

00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.000
have ABV on the bottle.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:14.940
So, fermentation--

00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:17.980
sugar consumed by yeast,
converted into ethanol and

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.510
carbon dioxide.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:26.060
Take a look over there and see
how our fermentation is going.

00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:27.670
We seeing a cap on that yet?

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:29.920
This has only been in here for
a couple of seconds, right?

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:30.520
We're going to watch.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.790
This will probably
overflow the cap.

00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:34.040
So [INAUDIBLE], at some point.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:36.070
I may need you to run out
and take care of this.

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:38.300
But I'm going to try
and keep it here.

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:40.440
So we'll keep an eye on that.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.550
whisky, I mentioned, produced
through the fermentation of

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:46.180
barley, primarily.

00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:47.050
Barley.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:51.340
I used honey because honey
has a nice sugar content.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.850
Barley, not so much.

00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:55.360
Not a lot of sugar in barley.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.800
So we'll talk about
that in a minute.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:59.200
I want you to keep that
in mind, where is

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.020
the sugar in barley?

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:03.280
But that's later.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.360
So steps to making whisky.

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:06.880
First thing you need
to do is take that

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.440
barley and mash it up.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.700
You need to break the husks.

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.620
You need to get to the middle
of the barley where all the

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:13.650
good stuff is.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:17.250
That's called mashing
or washing.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.060
And that produces a liquid
called wort.

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:23.300
It's spelled "wort," but it's
actually pronounced "wert."

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.350
And that is a small mash tun.

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:28.670
This is a large mash tun.

00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.560
This is the Glenfiddich
Distillery in Scotland.

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.430
I was just there a
few weeks ago.

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:34.570
These are enormous.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:35.820
You can see the scale.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:43.510
Once you have that wort, you
then pitch the yeast just like

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:44.090
I did here.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:47.020
And you can see that yeast
cap is growing.

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:48.930
And it begins to ferment.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:50.970
It's usually done in
an open container

00:11:50.970 --> 00:11:53.020
just like that glass.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:12:00.160
This cap of CO2 essentially
forms a cover on top of the

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.440
wort so nothing else
can get in there.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.170
Once this fermentation starts,
this is as good as sealed.

00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:10.180
So even though this is called
open fermentation because it

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:14.710
is an open vessel, it's actually
a closed system.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:17.350
This is a layer of CO2 that
keeps anything else from

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:18.990
getting in there.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:21.860
So open fermentation is
still used today.

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:24.630
This is actually the Maker's
Mark distillery, I believe, is

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:25.880
where I took that picture.

00:12:28.170 --> 00:12:31.110
So I mentioned how
fermentation--

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.360
fermentation produces beer.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.920
Fermentation produces wine.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.060
Fermentation produces cider.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:40.730
And fermentation
produces mead.

00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:43.920
Those are our four basic
fermented beverages.

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.140
Beer is from barley.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:48.136
Cider is from what?

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:48.540
AUDIENCE: Fruits.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.440
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Fruits.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:49.920
Good.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.820
Pomaceous fruits, usually
apples, pears.

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.650
Wine, we all know
from grapes--

00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:57.380
berries, actually, but
mostly grapes.

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.380
And mead.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.220
I mentioned mead.

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.340
What is mead produced from?

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.220
Honey.

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.530
That's what I'm making
right here.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:05.310
This is mead.

00:13:05.310 --> 00:13:07.810
We think mead is probably
the oldest of all

00:13:07.810 --> 00:13:09.180
the fermented beverages.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.170
But the thing about fermented
beverages, folks, is because

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:17.900
alcohol is toxic, they stop
at a certain ABV.

00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.200
The yeast goes dormant
or dies.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:25.160
So you've never have wine at
higher than about 18% alcohol.

00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.910
Beer, in America, 5%
or 6% alcohol.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.040
If you want to go higher than
that, if you want to get to

00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.650
that 40% alcohol or even higher,
you have to physically

00:13:35.650 --> 00:13:37.580
pull the alcohol out.

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.740
You have to separate
the alcohol from

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:40.830
the rest of the liquid.

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:44.490
And you do that through a
process called distillation.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.900
And that's really the core
of the spirits industry.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:52.730
Distillation separates liquids
based on a difference in

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:53.840
boiling point.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.760
So we know water, for example,
boils at about 212 degrees

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.790
Fahrenheit.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:01.350
Turns out that ethyl alcohol
boils at 173.

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.790
So if I heat a mixture of ethyl
alcohol and water--

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:12.420
if I heat this mixture to about
175, the ethyl alcohol

00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.130
will turn into a gas.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:16.130
It will boil.

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:19.520
The water will remain liquid.

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:29.230
If I then capture that gas,
that ethyl alcohol gas, in

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:36.120
something like this and then
cool it back down below 173,

00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.260
I've now separated the
ethyl alcohol out.

00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:43.355
And I left back in the
pot just the water.

00:14:43.355 --> 00:14:43.630
OK?

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:45.580
And that is distillation.

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:52.360
So I'm actually running here a
distillation demonstration.

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.130
In this pot, I have beer,
plain old beer.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:15:02.050
It's exactly what this will
be in about two days.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:02.360
OK?

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:06.020
So I'm doing the entire process
in front of you.

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.860
I now heat this up.

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.582
This is going to heat
to about 180.

00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:14.040
The ethyl alcohol will turn into
a gas captured down here.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.750
This is ice that will
cool it back down.

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.580
And dripping out of here in
just a few minutes will be

00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.150
pure ethyl alcohol.

00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:22.570
And I'm going to prove
that it's pure

00:15:22.570 --> 00:15:23.940
ethyl alcohol to you.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:25.020
How do you think I'm
going to do that?

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:26.400
AUDIENCE: Set it on fire.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.040
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Same way
the tax collectors did.

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:28.970
Exactly right.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:30.330
So somebody keep
an eye on that.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:31.610
Can you see that from
where you are?

00:15:31.610 --> 00:15:33.570
You let me know if that
starts dripping.

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:34.660
OK, great.

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:38.110
So that is distillation.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.650
So, these so far are all the
basic steps to making whisky.

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.870
I have cereal grains.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:47.800
I mash them, mix them up with
water, and break them down.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.970
I ferment them, and then
I distill them.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:53.840
Unfortunately, all I have at
that point is moonshine.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:58.510
I have just a clear distillate
that's very harsh and very

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.700
difficult to drink.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.490
In order to turn it into
whisky, I need

00:16:02.490 --> 00:16:04.570
to age it in wood.

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.150
And that's where the
magic happens.

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:09.410
This is basically a diagram of a
laboratory version of what I

00:16:09.410 --> 00:16:11.900
have going on right there.

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.680
This is my favorite still in the
whole world because I'm a

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:14.900
huge "MASH" fan.

00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.510
And it shows you how simple
this technology is, folks.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:19.470
This is actually based on
a true story. "MASH" was

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.010
actually based on
true stories.

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.770
This was actually a war
zone in a tent, right?

00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:27.600
And they were actually making
distillations in a

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.150
war zone in a tent.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:30.580
This is the Glenfiddich
Distillery

00:16:30.580 --> 00:16:32.310
in Speyside, Scotland.

00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:35.920
These pot stills are exactly
the same as those, except

00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.170
they're giant.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:41.180
The second type of distillation
I'm going to

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:45.220
mention very, very briefly
is column distillation.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:48.680
This is called a pot
still, a pot still.

00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:50.610
It's also called
a batch still.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.580
And that's because you
do it in batches.

00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:54.250
You put some beer in here.

00:16:54.250 --> 00:16:55.300
You distill it.

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:58.160
You empty this out, and
then you do it again.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.900
Really, really great, but it
doesn't work so well for

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:02.590
industrial settings.

00:17:02.590 --> 00:17:04.930
Because you have to keep
starting it and stopping it.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.640
We're doing pretty good
on this, yeah?

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.569
Happens pretty quickly.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:11.770
You have to keep starting
it and stopping it.

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:15.780
They came up with another way to
distill beverages based on

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:19.060
heat exchange that allows you to
consistently pump the beer

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:23.290
in and pull the alcohol out
because they have steam coming

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:25.670
in from the top, distillate
coming in from the bottom.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.619
And you can just keep the
whole process going.

00:17:27.619 --> 00:17:31.230
This is called a column
or continuous still.

00:17:31.230 --> 00:17:35.230
We use this for grain
whiskies, generally.

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.930
So for those of you who are
really, really into scotches,

00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:41.440
we have malt scotches and
we have grain scotches.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.900
Malt scotches are generally
made from barley.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.140
Grain scotches are generally
made from wheat.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:48.330
They're lighter, and they're
a little cleaner.

00:17:48.330 --> 00:17:51.080
If you're going for a lighter,
cleaner style of spirit,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.390
you're going to use
a column still.

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:56.690
If you're going for a more
character-based style of

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:00.680
spirit, you're going to use a
pot still or a batch still.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:04.110
So I just mention that so you
guys can be familiar with what

00:18:04.110 --> 00:18:05.780
the two types of distillation
are.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:09.370
This is what one actually
looks like in the field.

00:18:09.370 --> 00:18:12.990
And now we have our distillate
that actually comes out as

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:15.690
what we call new whisky
or green whisky.

00:18:15.690 --> 00:18:20.360
This then gets put
in a barrel.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.860
Barrels were generally
used for wine, right?

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.260
Barrels were used to age wine.

00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:29.990
I want you to remember
that wine was only

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:31.960
reserved for the rich.

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.400
In general, rich people
drank wine.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:36.250
Wine's very expensive to make.

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:39.420
Grapes are very temperamental,
and it's a very

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.250
labor-intensive process
to make wine.

00:18:42.250 --> 00:18:43.900
So the rich people drank wine.

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:48.780
Spirits, up until very recently,
were generally

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:51.130
consumed by the poor, by
the lower classes,

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.870
by the working classes.

00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:56.380
Because all they wanted
was that alcohol kick.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.430
So what they would do is take
whatever the byproducts that

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.610
happened to be in
the area, they

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.820
would ferment and distill.

00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.870
And then they would age them,
and they would end up with

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.320
spirits that were very unique
to whatever regions you

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:10.300
happened to be in.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.960
So, for example, in Italy, you
make a ton of wine in Italy.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:18.260
The peasants would take
all the byproducts

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:19.550
of making that wine.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:20.840
They would take the seeds.

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:21.950
They would take the stems.

00:19:21.950 --> 00:19:23.360
They would take the leaves.

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.290
They would take everything that
wasn't actually used in

00:19:25.290 --> 00:19:26.150
making wine.

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.000
They would take that home.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.250
They would press all
that stuff again.

00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.800
And believe it or not, there's
enough residual sugar left in

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.030
those wine byproducts
that they could

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:37.070
ferment that liquid.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.020
And then they would
distill it.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:40.940
And they would end up
with their peasant

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:42.470
spirit, which is grappa.

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.040
You've heard of grappa?

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:47.250
Grappa is made from the
byproducts of wine-making.

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:49.340
We've all had rum, yes?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:53.150
Rum is a byproduct
of sugar making.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.040
They would make sugar.

00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:55.060
They would refine sugar.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:58.140
When you refine sugar, you end
up with a ton of molasses and

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:01.240
a ton of sugar cane syrup, which
the rich people would

00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.300
just dump behind the plantations
in giant lagoons.

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:07.720
And it would rain, and yeast
would fall in them, and it

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:08.850
would ferment.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:11.210
And the peasants would take
that liquid home, and they

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:12.500
would distill it.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.870
And they would end
up with rum.

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.660
So this is the story behind
most spirits.

00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:20.270
And the reason I mention this to
you is because I want to go

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:24.070
to Scotland now, particularly
the UK, where their spirit is

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.190
based on barley.

00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:28.720
And they end up with a
barley distillate.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.180
And they now have
to store this.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:31.410
And what are they going
to store it in?

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.490
Well, they're going to store it
in whatever the rich people

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:36.110
are done using, which
is wine barrels.

00:20:36.110 --> 00:20:39.890
And in Scotland in particular,
it was sherry barrels.

00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:42.720
Because all of the nobles
were drinking sherry.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.890
So they would take their raw
distillate and put it in

00:20:44.890 --> 00:20:47.610
sherry barrels, take
it out two or three

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:49.090
or four years later.

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.760
And lo and behold, it turned
into an amazing, amazing

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.090
elixir that they called
Scotch whisky.

00:20:56.090 --> 00:20:57.790
Or in that corner, it was
just calling it whisky.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.960
There was no other whisky.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.990
It was just whisky.

00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:02.810
And to this day, if you go to
Scotland and you order whisky,

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.730
you don't order scotch.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:05.310
You order whisky, right?

00:21:05.310 --> 00:21:09.680
So, barrels were traditionally
used for wines.

00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.440
Once you put the alcohol in
the barrel, that ethanol

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.490
starts to dissolve really,
really great stuff

00:21:18.490 --> 00:21:19.740
that's in the wood.

00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.320
Starts to dissolve some of the
sugars in the wood, starts to

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.980
dissolve some the chemicals in
the wood, things like lignins,

00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:26.720
which taste like vanilla.

00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:29.190
Starts to dissolve some of
the caramels in the wood.

00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:32.420
And all of those things
marry with the

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:34.450
spirit over the course--

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:36.620
ah, thank you for keeping
an eye on that.

00:21:36.620 --> 00:21:40.080
All of those things marry with
the spirit over the course of

00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:46.650
many, many years and end up
mellowing that alcohol and

00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.130
turning it into this whisky
that we love so much.

00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:51.750
So here's a cooperage.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:54.340
People who make barrels
are called coopers.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:57.250
This was taken just
a month or so ago.

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.590
And this is all in Scotland.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:02.390
So you can age whisky
now in any number of

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.760
different types of casks.

00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:07.150
And I want you to start
using the word cask.

00:22:07.150 --> 00:22:09.230
Barrel is not the right word.

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:12.020
Cask is the word that we use.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.410
A barrel is actually a specific
size of cask.

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.440
It's the most common size.

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.300
But cask is actually the
correct technical term.

00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:25.430
French oak is mostly
used in Europe.

00:22:25.430 --> 00:22:26.890
Oak is all we use, by the way.

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:29.250
Oak is the only thing that
you can age spirits in.

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.060
We've tried every other
type of wood.

00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.020
Nothing works like oak.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.510
French oak is mostly used in
Europe, and it imparts a

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.700
distinctive vanilla character
to the spirit.

00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:41.440
American oak imparts
more of a caramel

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:43.660
character to the spirit.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:46.750
In addition to that now, I
mentioned that these whiskies

00:22:46.750 --> 00:22:51.210
were aged in casks that were
used for other things by the

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.140
wealthy people.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.760
And in Scotland,
usually sherry.

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:57.800
They didn't have the luxury
of buying brand new casks.

00:22:57.800 --> 00:22:59.080
These were peasants.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.100
You used whatever happened
to be around.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.830
So in Scotland, they were
using sherry casks.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:09.630
That imparts a spicy character
to the whisky.

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:11.850
We now don't use sherry casks.

00:23:11.850 --> 00:23:15.610
Most scotch is actually
aged in bourbon casks.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:17.910
Because that's what we
have the most of.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:21.380
So the vast majority of scotch
in the world is aged in Jim

00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.630
Beam and Jack Daniels casks.

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:27.600
Because that's, again,
what we have.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:31.110
That imparts more of a sweet
character to the whisky.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:35.570
So if you taste scotch today
aged in bourbon casks, it's

00:23:35.570 --> 00:23:39.630
significantly different from
scotch produced about 50 years

00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:42.500
ago that's aged in
sherry casks.

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.590
And if you want to taste the
difference, taste pretty much

00:23:46.590 --> 00:23:49.320
any scotch that you buy is
going to be bourbon.

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:51.690
But then buy Macallan.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:53.880
Macallan, to this day,
is still aged

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.430
in 100% sherry casks.

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.870
So Macallan will give you a
really good idea of what

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:02.580
traditional sherry-aged scotch
will taste like.

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:05.740
And it is noticeably darker
and noticeably more spicy.

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.230
A couple of examples
of cask sizes.

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:17.170
I'd mentioned that just really
briefly I want to touch on

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.220
what this means.

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.080
I want you to think now in
terms of surface area.

00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.310
If I have a very, very large
cask, I'm going to have much

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.260
less reaction with the wood for
a given amount of time.

00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:34.630
So as I am creating whiskies
now, I can actually determine

00:24:34.630 --> 00:24:37.860
how much effect the wood is
going to have on the whisky by

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.240
the size of the cask
that I use.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.910
So if I age my whisky in a very
small cask, I'm going to

00:24:42.910 --> 00:24:45.310
have much more interaction
with the wood.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:47.630
If I age my whisky in a large
cask, I'm going to have much

00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:49.340
less interaction
with the wood.

00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:52.870
I can age some whisky in large,
some whisky in small,

00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:54.240
and blend them.

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.410
I can age whisky in
a small cask for a

00:24:57.410 --> 00:24:58.680
short period of time.

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.050
I can age whisky in
a large cask for a

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:02.400
long period of time.

00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:06.020
I can control a whole bunch of
different variables just based

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:07.270
on the size of the cask.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:13.380
I also will char the
inside of the cask.

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:14.620
That does two things.

00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:17.560
One, it removes some of
the character from

00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.280
the previous fill.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:21.230
Whatever was in the cask,
some of that will

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:22.750
be removed by charring.

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:25.060
The other thing it does
is it caramelizes the

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:26.930
sugars in the wood.

00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:28.450
OK, so any of you guys cook?

00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:30.150
Who are my cooks here
in the room?

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.060
Yeah.

00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.300
You brown onions, right?

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.030
We've all caramelized onions.

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:36.510
They actually turn
brown, right?

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:37.610
We've made caramel.

00:25:37.610 --> 00:25:38.690
You take white sugar.

00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:40.420
You heat it up, and
it turns brown.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.470
That's called the Maillard
reaction.

00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:45.900
That actually breaks complex
sugars down into simple

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:49.880
sugars, easier to digest so
they taste sweeter to us.

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.480
And that's what we're doing
with this cask,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.710
the exact same thing.

00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:58.880
So when I add something like
alcohol to the cask, it's now

00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.380
going to dissolve those sugars
and incorporate those sugars

00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.050
into the spirit.

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:04.370
AUDIENCE: You're getting
some dripping.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:05.600
ANTHONY CAPORALE: What?

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:06.630
Thank you.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:08.860
You guys are good.

00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:10.900
And I'm going to keep
track of this.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:12.870
So are we impressed with
fermentation, guys?

00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:13.580
I mean, how's that?

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.550
For like, what--

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.780
15, 20 minutes?

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.970
It's as simple as that.

00:26:16.970 --> 00:26:19.300
And believe it or not, there are
college kids all over the

00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.470
country that are doing this
right now in their fridge.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:26.110
You can literally take cider,
and you can put yeast in the

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.370
cider, and they put a
balloon on top just

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:29.380
to make an air lock.

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.120
They don't need to,
but they do.

00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.920
And you will end up with
drinkable dry cider after

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:35.790
about three days.

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.530
And remember, the beautiful
thing about fermentation and

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:42.250
alcoholic beverages in general,
they're difficult to

00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:43.360
make taste well.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:45.570
It's difficult to make
beer taste good.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:48.560
It's impossible to make a
fermented beverage that will

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:51.170
harm you unless you drink
too much of it.

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:54.510
But other than that, it
will be safe to drink.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:59.410
And believe it or not, it will
be safer to drink than the

00:26:59.410 --> 00:27:03.690
local water supply if we're
anywhere outside of a few

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:05.600
years hundred years
from today.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.030
You're safer drinking a
fermented beverage than you

00:27:08.030 --> 00:27:10.990
would be drinking from the
river, stream, or well.

00:27:10.990 --> 00:27:11.980
All right?

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.360
Really, really simple stuff.

00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.490
So let's see what we have
going on right here.

00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:19.950
My handy dandy torch.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.756
Good?

00:27:25.756 --> 00:27:28.540
Can we see this?

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:29.640
Yes?

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:32.244
OK.

00:27:32.244 --> 00:27:35.540
And that, folks, is
as difficult as

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:36.810
distillation gets.

00:27:36.810 --> 00:27:39.610
So what I've done right in front
of you within the space

00:27:39.610 --> 00:27:42.330
of about, what, 30 minutes,
is we've gone

00:27:42.330 --> 00:27:44.660
from honey and yeast.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:48.270
The only thing I skipped is I
took this and put it in a can.

00:27:48.270 --> 00:27:50.520
But other than that, it was
the exact same thing.

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:54.590
Honey and yeast right
down to moonshine.

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:57.970
If I then put this in wood,
I end up with whisky.

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:01.580
So you've seen the whole
process, very, very low tech,

00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:04.430
stuff that's been going
on for centuries.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:05.760
OK, we can have--

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.500
getting back to the cask--
different levels of cask char.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.610
The longer you char the cask,
the darker the roast.

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.140
And it's the same like coffee.

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.930
You end up with more caramel,
more sugars.

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:22.960
Darker char gives you a darker
character to the whisky.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.790
This is what we do with
the cask after.

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.040
We just put them
in warehouses.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.690
But now we come back to
the big question.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:35.530
And this is really what makes
scotch so interesting to me.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:38.110
Where is the sugar
in barley, folks?

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:40.020
We've all had--

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:42.440
many of us probably have not had
barley, but we've all had

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.520
things that are similar
to barley.

00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.370
We've had granola.

00:28:44.370 --> 00:28:45.720
We've had cereal.

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:45.910
Right?

00:28:45.910 --> 00:28:49.780
We don't generally think
of grains as being

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.370
particularly sweet.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:55.130
And we know that in order for
fermentation to happen, we

00:28:55.130 --> 00:28:56.830
have to have sugar.

00:28:56.830 --> 00:28:59.320
That's what yeast consumes.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.220
And it has to be in solution.

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:02.670
We can't just have
a pile of sugar.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.180
It's got to be in
water, right?

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.600
Which is why I did this.

00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:10.190
So where is the sugar
in barley?

00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:11.770
There isn't much.

00:29:11.770 --> 00:29:15.410
Barley is a seed.

00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:17.830
I think seeds, in general,
are amazing.

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:23.940
Seeds are basically little
lifeboats for baby plants.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:24.200
Right?

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:24.740
That's what they are.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:26.460
They're lifeboats
for baby plants.

00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:29.580
And we have found seeds in
Egyptian tombs, believe it or

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:33.550
not, that we can then plant
and get to germinate.

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:36.800
That's how good seeds
are at preserving

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:39.540
the baby plant inside.

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.750
But there's a trick that they
have to use in order to be so

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.180
good at this.

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:45.840
We consume sugar.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:49.050
Life consumes sugar,
including plants.

00:29:49.050 --> 00:29:51.730
That plant needs
sugar to grow.

00:29:51.730 --> 00:29:55.730
But if the mother plant were
to just surround the baby

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:59.370
plant with sugar, guess
what would happen?

00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:00.650
Yeast would eat it.

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:02.190
Everything would eat it.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:07.225
It would never end up being in
a tomb for 2,000 years and

00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:08.610
then be able to germinate.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.220
So plants came up with
a cool trick.

00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:13.060
They took the sugar, and they
said, we're going to change

00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.850
the form of the sugar
just a little bit.

00:30:14.850 --> 00:30:17.640
And we're going to turn it into
something called starch,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.890
which is a carbohydrate.

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.210
We're going to turn
it into starch.

00:30:20.210 --> 00:30:27.410
Starch, now, actually, is
something that if you're

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.230
yeast, you can't act on.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:32.260
So starch is something that
you can surround the plant

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:36.400
with, and nothing else will be
able to eat that starch.

00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:40.280
Unfortunately, the plant
can't eat it either.

00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.990
Before the plant can use
it, it has to be

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.530
converted back to sugar.

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:47.390
So the mother plant
does two things.

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:49.190
One, it surrounds the baby
plant with starch.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.686
And two, it puts a little enzyme
packet in the seed.

00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:55.610
And that enzyme packet
is activated

00:30:55.610 --> 00:30:58.470
when the seed is planted.

00:30:58.470 --> 00:31:01.200
When you plant the seed, the
enzyme packet breaks open,

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.390
converts the starch into sugar,
and the plant can now

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:08.690
use it in order to grow until
it breaks the ground and can

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:10.100
start photosynthesis.

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:13.890
But how does the seed know
when it's been planted?

00:31:13.890 --> 00:31:15.940
When it gets wet.

00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:18.820
That's the signal,
when it gets wet.

00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.790
So if I have barley, which is
essentially starch, but I want

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:27.600
to convert that starch into
sugar so that I can ferment

00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:32.340
it, what I have to do is trick
that barley into thinking it's

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:34.010
been planted.

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:39.200
So what we do is we lay
it out on a floor,

00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.280
and we wet it down.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.300
When we wet it down, that enzyme
starts to react with

00:31:47.300 --> 00:31:51.170
the starch, converts the starch
into sugar, and the

00:31:51.170 --> 00:31:53.220
baby plant begins to grow.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.430
This is called malting.

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:58.870
And if you've heard the term
malted barley or malt, that's

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.260
what they're talking about.

00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.020
Once that baby plant starts to
grow, we know the starch has

00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:08.560
been converted into sugar, and
we need to then stop that

00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.635
conversion.

00:32:09.635 --> 00:32:13.950
And we do that by reversing the
process that started it.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.730
We dry the barley out.

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:18.500
And we do that by generally
lighting low

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.070
fires under the barley.

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:21.560
It will dry the barley out.

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.440
It will stop that process.

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.470
And now, we can take
that barley.

00:32:25.470 --> 00:32:27.930
We can mash it, as
I showed you.

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:28.940
We can ferment it.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.630
And we can distill it.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.560
So that whole process is called
malting, and that is

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:37.210
what ends up giving scotch
it's really, really

00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.670
distinctive character.

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.570
Because in order to dry the
barley, we have to, as I

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.950
mentioned, light
fires under it.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.760
And in Scotland, they don't
have a lot of wood.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:52.060
What they do have
is peat moss.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:56.910
And peat moss has a very
distinctive aroma.

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:00.180
I'm going to pass
it out for you.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.750
Go ahead and pass that around
the room, and just nose that.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:05.860
And that is the aroma
of peat moss.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:14.110
That aroma from drying the
barley, that smoke character,

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.890
ends up staying with the whisky
through the grinding

00:33:17.890 --> 00:33:20.560
process, through the washing
process, through the

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:24.190
fermentation, through the
distillation, through the

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:29.430
aging in wood for up to 25, 30
years, and into the bottle.

00:33:29.430 --> 00:33:33.620
And we still don't understand
how that smoke character ends

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:36.750
up lasting through that whole
process, but it does.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.700
And it's really, really
amazing to me.

00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:41.060
And it's one of the things, as
I said, that makes scotch so

00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:42.050
interesting.

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.750
And it's really important that
we understand why this malting

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:47.830
process is necessary.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:56.250
And it's all about making that
sugar accessible to the

00:33:56.250 --> 00:34:02.100
distiller before it was
accessible to anything else.

00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.460
Because if that plant was
surrounded by sugar, it would

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.469
never be able to survive
as a seed.

00:34:08.469 --> 00:34:09.760
Make sense?

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:10.920
OK.

00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:17.630
So here we have what I call
the magic of malting.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:19.650
So to produce ethanol from
grains, you have to convert

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:22.620
the starch back to ferment-able
sugars through

00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:25.360
the process called malting.

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:29.880
This is starch and water, yields
maltose, which is a

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.560
form of sugar that we use
to ferment, and oxygen.

00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:35.989
That's the malting equation.

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.500
Grains are made to germinate
by soaking in water, which

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.639
develop the enzymes.

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:44.770
This is called modifying the
starch back into sugars.

00:34:44.770 --> 00:34:49.960
And this is the process that
allows us essentially to form

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:52.489
the spirit industry.

00:34:52.489 --> 00:34:55.429
The maltose that we produce is
then broken down into fructose

00:34:55.429 --> 00:34:56.540
and glucose.

00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.830
Yeast can then convert those
fructose and glucose molecules

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:01.826
into ethanol and carbon dioxide
through fermentation.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:05.810
Here's your equation.

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.930
Glucose yields ethanol
and carbon dioxide.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:15.240
So that is essentially
the chemistry

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.750
behind the spirits industry.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.745
And I say that every drop of
alcohol is essentially a ray

00:35:20.745 --> 00:35:21.940
of star shine.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:25.760
Because that's really where
this all comes from.

00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:28.230
Our bodies retrieve the energy
stored in the chemical bonds

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:32.600
of ethanol through the oxidation
to acetaldehyde and

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:33.850
finally acetal.

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:40.670
And basically, I like to say
that's why I hate "The

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:44.050
Matrix." Because if you
remember, in "The Matrix,"

00:35:44.050 --> 00:35:46.570
they never accounted for the
fact that energy was being put

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:47.770
into the system.

00:35:47.770 --> 00:35:50.730
They were just constantly
harvesting people, right?

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:54.010
You have to have energy put into
the system at some point.

00:35:54.010 --> 00:35:58.630
And it always has to start
with sunshine.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.660
So this is what floor malting
looks like, just a bunch of

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:04.250
barley laid out over
the floor.

00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:05.600
This is what a peat
bog looks like.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.100
This is where we actually
harvest the peat that we'll

00:36:08.100 --> 00:36:11.610
then use to dry the malt.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:13.540
And this is what the malted
barley looks like.

00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:14.610
They'll actually--

00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:18.400
they can tell when to stop the
malting process by the length

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.930
of those rootlets.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.950
And the master malter will
actually go through and pick

00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:25.100
up a handful of malted barley
and measure the

00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:26.120
length of the rootlets.

00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:29.000
And by the length of the
rootlets, he can tell whether

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.350
or not the sugar has been
completely modified.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:37.890
So let's look at a summary
now, of making whisky.

00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:40.210
First, we have to harvest
the grain.

00:36:40.210 --> 00:36:41.530
Then, we have to
mill the grain.

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:44.360
We have to crack the
shell of the grain

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.770
to get to the inside.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.810
We wash it into wort.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.810
We then ferment the wort into
beer, distill the beer into

00:36:51.810 --> 00:36:52.450
new whisky.

00:36:52.450 --> 00:36:54.500
We age it into casks.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:58.530
At that point, we can now blend
the whisky, very, very

00:36:58.530 --> 00:36:59.570
common in the industry.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:01.340
We've all had Johnny
Walker, yes?

00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:02.760
We've all had Dewar's.

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.500
These are all blended
whiskies.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.270
What a blended whisky is, you'll
take whisky from a

00:37:08.270 --> 00:37:11.470
number of different distillers,
a number of

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:15.090
different ages, and you'll
blend them all together.

00:37:15.090 --> 00:37:19.070
And the idea is to produce a
consistent whisky over time.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.990
So if whisky A comes in a little
sweeter than usual,

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.000
you'll maybe use a little less
of it in the blend in order to

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.790
maintain a consistent profile.

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:30.470
Next time it comes in a little
less sweet, you'll use a

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.570
little more of it.

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:34.840
But your whisky blend,
the profile, will be

00:37:34.840 --> 00:37:36.960
consistent over time.

00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:39.780
Those are called blended
whiskies.

00:37:39.780 --> 00:37:42.720
The alternative to a blended
whisky is what's called a

00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.050
single malt whisky.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:46.420
And we've all had single
malt scotches.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:50.510
And a single malt whisky is
a single distillery and

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:54.530
generally a single
harvest of malt.

00:37:54.530 --> 00:37:57.320
So it's much more difficult
to maintain

00:37:57.320 --> 00:37:59.770
consistency over time.

00:37:59.770 --> 00:38:04.450
Any variation in that malted
whisky is going to show up in

00:38:04.450 --> 00:38:06.030
the end product.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.380
Whatever comes off the still,
whatever comes out of that

00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.860
barrel, that's what's going
to end up in the bottle.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:14.250
So if you're trying to make
Macallan, and you end up with

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:18.040
a batch that doesn't quite taste
like the way Macallan

00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:21.760
used to taste, you have to sell
that batch to a blender.

00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.620
You can't bottle it as
Macallan because your

00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.920
customers are not going
to want it.

00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:26.830
They're not going to
be used to that.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.965
So single malt is a little
bit riskier to make.

00:38:34.130 --> 00:38:36.360
The peat's making its
round, the smoke?

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:36.930
Right?

00:38:36.930 --> 00:38:39.680
Pretty intense, yes?

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.800
So some of the flavors that
we're looking for in whiskies

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.210
in general, obviously grain is
going to be the primary flavor

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:48.620
in all whiskies.

00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:53.090
Cereal, sometimes described as
bran, biscuitty, malty, mashy.

00:38:53.090 --> 00:38:56.590
Wood is the next most
prominent flavor.

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:59.870
And there are some distillers
that actually say wood is the

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:01.610
most prominent flavor.

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:05.190
A lot of the folks that I work
with today are saying that 60%

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.780
of the flavor of any whisky
comes from the wood.

00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.910
And they're actually investing
a lot of money in what they

00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:12.720
call wood technology.

00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:16.310
Has anyone ever tried
Maker's 46?

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.850
No?

00:39:16.850 --> 00:39:19.240
OK, so we all know Maker's
Mark, yes?

00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.370
Maker's Mark came out
with a new bourbon.

00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.260
Now, Maker's Mark
is a bourbon.

00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.890
They came up with a new bourbon
call Maker's 46.

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:27.980
It was the first new product
that they'd introduced in

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:30.210
about 55 years.

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:33.440
Maker's 46 is what they called
it, and people can't figure

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.560
out why they called
it Maker's 46.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:38.250
People think that it's
46 years old.

00:39:38.250 --> 00:39:41.520
People think that
it's 46 proof.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:46.670
46 is actually the number
of what they

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.520
call the wood profile.

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.430
Out of 100 different types of
wood that they tested, they

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:57.950
ended up using the 46th.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.080
So they called Maker's
46 Maker's 46

00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:02.720
based on the wood profile.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:07.140
And my point here is that they
tried 100 different types of

00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:11.480
wood charred 100 different ways
before they came up with

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:14.070
one that they felt worked.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.960
And that's the level of
investment and time that

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.160
people are putting into
wood technology today.

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:22.550
Because wood has so much
influence on the final

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:24.340
character of the whisky.

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:30.120
All right, so oak, cedar, nut,
marzipan, walnut-- all these

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.940
things can come from wood.

00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.740
In addition to that, we have
what we call sweet aromatics.

00:40:35.740 --> 00:40:37.450
And that's things
like vanillas,

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.050
caramels, maple syrup.

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:41.430
Believe it or not, those also
come from the wood.

00:40:41.430 --> 00:40:44.320
And that's from the
caramelization of sugar.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.160
And then we have the
spice component.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.720
And the spice component also
comes generally from the wood.

00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:52.940
There's a little bit added by
the cereal, but most of it is

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.190
from the wood.

00:40:56.470 --> 00:40:59.670
Fruit and floral, we can get
everything from cherries,

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:02.400
oranges, blackberries,
peaches to things

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.310
like rose and lavender.

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.960
For Scotch and Irish whiskies,
we have peat, which you guys

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.330
all just smelled and tasted, and
then the astringent notes

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:13.560
that come from the
alcohol itself.

00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.790
So let's talk now a little bit
about scotch whisky in

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.500
particular, so that you have
an idea of what the scotch

00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:22.040
whisky regulations are.

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.220
One, in order to be called
scotch, it has

00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:25.640
to be made in Scotland.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.970
And believe it or not,
that's a revelation

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:29.200
to some folks, right?

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.080
You can't call it scotch if
it's not made in Scotland.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.910
It has to be made from malted
barley, and it has to be

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:41.880
distilled to less than 95%.

00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:45.270
So now that you guys know a
lot about fermentation and

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:48.190
distillation, I want you to
start thinking about-- when I

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:51.450
say things like, it has to be
distilled to less than 95%

00:41:51.450 --> 00:41:55.710
alcohol, let's talk about
what that means.

00:41:55.710 --> 00:42:00.530
Why would they restrict the
percentage that I can

00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:01.800
distill whisky to?

00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:04.490
Why would they say I
can't distill it

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.150
above a certain percent?

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:08.794
Any thoughts on that?

00:42:08.794 --> 00:42:10.586
AUDIENCE: --the flavors.

00:42:10.586 --> 00:42:12.110
Won't you get a change in the
flavor profile, if it's 5%?

00:42:12.110 --> 00:42:13.820
ANTHONY CAPORALE: You bet.

00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:13.890
Yep.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:16.640
You get a change in the
flavor profile.

00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.660
The more pure the alcohol coming
off the still, the less

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:25.930
character of the base grain
that comes with it.

00:42:25.930 --> 00:42:27.770
So think about that
for a second.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:33.190
If coming out of this still is
99% ethyl alcohol, there's

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.300
almost nothing left of
the original base

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:39.100
grain in that 99%.

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:45.370
If I reduce that to 80%, let's
say 20% is water that comes

00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:46.880
from the base grain.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:48.870
And with that water is
going to be essential

00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:50.970
oils, asters, aromatics.

00:42:50.970 --> 00:42:56.480
So the lower the percent you
distill to, the more original

00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.700
character of the base
grain you preserve.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.860
So for a spirit like whisky
where we want that base

00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:07.200
character, we want that grain
character, you want to

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:11.010
restrict the distillation ABV.

00:43:11.010 --> 00:43:13.560
Can you think of a spirit
where they would want to

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.420
distill to a very high percent,
where they want very

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:19.675
little of the base character?

00:43:19.675 --> 00:43:19.990
AUDIENCE: Vodka.

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.750
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
You've got it.

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:21.300
Who said vodka?

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:22.290
Yes.

00:43:22.290 --> 00:43:23.000
Vodka.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.330
Vodka wants to be odorless,
colorless, tasteless.

00:43:25.330 --> 00:43:26.450
That's what it wants.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:30.060
So vodka has to be distilled to
a very, very high percent.

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:33.720
Whisky says no, you
can't distill

00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.950
above a certain percent.

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.570
We want that base character.

00:43:37.570 --> 00:43:38.710
OK?

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.720
I mentioned pot distillation
and column

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.770
distillation early on.

00:43:43.770 --> 00:43:46.300
Again, now you know enough about
distillation, I can talk

00:43:46.300 --> 00:43:47.590
about that a little bit.

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:52.140
With a column distillation or
a continuous distillation

00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:56.030
process, I want to take
a look at what we have

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.150
going on right here.

00:43:57.150 --> 00:44:02.240
With a still, if I'm doing a
batch distillation, I have

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.490
water and alcohol, and
it starts to heat up.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:09.380
Before it gets to about 175,
there are other things in here

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.350
besides water and alcohol.

00:44:11.350 --> 00:44:12.520
There are things that
come from the

00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:14.040
grain that are in there.

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:14.960
There are oils.

00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.020
There are esters.

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:18.220
There are all kinds of other
things in there.

00:44:18.220 --> 00:44:20.560
Some things good, some things
not so good, all

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.240
based from the plant.

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:27.800
Before that alcohol starts to
turn into a gas, other things

00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.110
start to evaporate first, things
with a lower boiling

00:44:32.110 --> 00:44:33.900
point than alcohol.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.440
We call those the heads.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:38.640
They have certain flavors.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:44.490
Then the alcohol starts to turn
into a gas and evaporate.

00:44:44.490 --> 00:44:45.860
We call that the heart.

00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:47.260
That's pure ethanol.

00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:52.040
Once the alcohol is done, other
things with a higher

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.370
boiling point than the alcohol
start to evaporate.

00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:56.610
We call those the tails.

00:44:56.610 --> 00:44:58.830
And those also have
flavors and odors

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.180
associated with them.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:02.690
What we really want
is that heart cut.

00:45:02.690 --> 00:45:04.340
We want the ethanol.

00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:07.160
But in a pot or batch
distillation, we

00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:08.850
get the heads first.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.890
Then we get the heart.

00:45:10.890 --> 00:45:13.250
And then we get the tails.

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:18.850
The distiller can decide what
cut he's going to take.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.740
So I want you to think about a
couple things now, one from an

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.610
economic standpoint.

00:45:23.610 --> 00:45:25.670
You want to take the largest
cut possible, because

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:27.250
everything that you're not
putting in the bottle, you're

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.980
throwing away, and
that's waste.

00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.550
So you want take the largest
cut possible.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:36.920
But the larger the cut you take,
the more heads and tails

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:38.760
end up in the bottle.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:44.080
And that oftentimes gives
you odors and aromas

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.770
that you may not want.

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.590
During prohibition, for example,
we've all heard of

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:50.130
bathtub gin, right?

00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:52.300
We know that during prohibition,
alcohol wasn't

00:45:52.300 --> 00:45:53.540
particularly high quality.

00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.120
Moonshine, to this day, has a
reputation for making you go

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:57.430
blind, right?

00:45:57.430 --> 00:46:00.090
Because moonshine produced in
the mountains of West Virginia

00:46:00.090 --> 00:46:03.320
by a guy who probably doesn't
have a Ph.D. In chemistry,

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:04.960
he's just taking the
whole thing and

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:05.650
putting it in a bottle.

00:46:05.650 --> 00:46:07.730
He's maximizing his profits.

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:10.030
Those heads and tails
will make you sick.

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.950
They will make you blind.

00:46:10.950 --> 00:46:12.400
They're toxic.

00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:12.680
OK?

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:17.880
They also do, however,
contribute flavors and odors

00:46:17.880 --> 00:46:20.360
to the final product.

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.810
So you take too much and you
end up with off odors, off

00:46:25.810 --> 00:46:28.340
aromas, and some toxins.

00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:30.110
You take too little,
however, and you're

00:46:30.110 --> 00:46:31.790
not making any money.

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:34.370
So there's a happy medium in
there that you have to decide

00:46:34.370 --> 00:46:36.020
on what you're going to take.

00:46:36.020 --> 00:46:39.080
That's pot distillation
or batch distillation.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.020
Column distillation, because
it's continuous, you don't

00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.750
have to worry about that.

00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:46.690
There's heads when
you turn it on.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:48.610
And then it runs for weeks.

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.980
Heart, heart, heart,
heart, heart.

00:46:50.980 --> 00:46:53.160
And then tails when
you turn it off.

00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:57.850
So a column or continuous still
is a much cleaner, purer

00:46:57.850 --> 00:47:00.330
method of distilling alcohol.

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:05.530
And believe it or not, with
whisky and scotch whisky, in

00:47:05.530 --> 00:47:10.140
particular, you're not allowed
to use column distillation for

00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:11.800
single malts.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:15.080
Because they don't want
it to be that clean.

00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:19.160
They want the character that's
imparted by some heads and

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.500
some tails.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.120
They don't just want
pure ethyl alcohol.

00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.350
So a couple of interesting
things on this slide.

00:47:27.350 --> 00:47:32.350
One, we're limiting the percent
ABV for distillation

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.940
in an attempt to preserve
character

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:35.620
of those base grains.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.790
We're also saying pot stills,
baby, in an attempt to

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.470
preserve the character
of those base grains.

00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:46.170
So do you see how whisky and
scotch whisky in particular,

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:50.710
it's very, very important that
they preserve that malted

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:55.200
barley character in the bottle
as opposed to, again, some

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.910
spirits that we can talk
about like vodka,

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.350
where that's not important.

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:02.150
And this is one of, to me,
one of the really, really

00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:04.840
interesting things about whisky,
is it's all about

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.600
preserving that grain
experience.

00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:12.750
Real quick, and then I'm going
to wrap up so that we can go

00:48:12.750 --> 00:48:14.980
drink, but again, I just want
you to know a little bit about

00:48:14.980 --> 00:48:17.050
some of these things
in Scotland.

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:22.460
There are four basic regions
that produce Scotland, and

00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:24.320
then one that doesn't really
do a whole lot.

00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:26.590
We have the lowlands,
the highlands, Islay

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.550
scotches, and Speyside.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:31.020
Campbeltown doesn't produce
a whole lot anymore.

00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:34.070
The one I want to point out for
the average person-- or

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:34.970
the two, actually--

00:48:34.970 --> 00:48:37.570
Islay and Speyside.

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:42.240
So Islay scotch, if you like
that peat aroma, if you like

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:44.700
that smoke that I passed
out, you want

00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.520
to drink Islay scotches.

00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:47.790
All right?

00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:48.960
You may want to write
that down.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.570
It is pronounced Islay.

00:48:50.570 --> 00:48:54.080
And Islay scotches are known for
producing very peaty, very

00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.090
smoky scotches.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:49:00.290
Speyside is the largest
region--

00:49:00.290 --> 00:49:01.560
not the largest geographically--

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:04.270
they produce the most scotches
and they produce generally

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:06.810
what's considered to be the
classic scotch whisky.

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.150
So if you want to get started on
very classic malt scotches,

00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:12.220
look for Speyside scotches.

00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.300
And we're actually going to
taste you, when we go

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:17.220
upstairs, we're going to taste
you on Drambuie 15, which is a

00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.050
Speyside malt.

00:49:19.050 --> 00:49:20.210
OK?

00:49:20.210 --> 00:49:22.180
Any questions?

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:22.850
No?

00:49:22.850 --> 00:49:23.275
Yes.

00:49:23.275 --> 00:49:26.940
AUDIENCE: Why is it always the
same years, like 12, 15?

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.030
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Great question.

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:32.040
So the question was, why do you
always see the same years

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:32.880
on the bottle?

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:37.340
One thing about years, know that
the year is the youngest

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:38.970
scotch in the bottle, by law.

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:42.400
So if the bottle says 12, there
may be older scotches in

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.870
that bottle, but there can't be
anything younger than 12 in

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:46.960
the bottle.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:50.950
Convention has said that we're
going to bottle scotch at 6

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:56.620
years, 8 years, 12 years, and
15 years, just convention.

00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.850
You'll see scotches
bottled at 17.

00:49:58.850 --> 00:50:01.140
You'll see scotches
bottled at 25.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:03.360
It's just a convention that
the industry has sort of

00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:05.510
adopted over time.

00:50:05.510 --> 00:50:07.100
Anything else?

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:07.385
Yes?

00:50:07.385 --> 00:50:09.220
AUDIENCE: How does
sour mash work?

00:50:09.220 --> 00:50:13.250
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Sour mash
is an American tradition.

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:16.000
And sour mash is what they
use for bourbons

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.570
and Tennessee whisky.

00:50:17.570 --> 00:50:21.830
And all sour mash means is
that they use a starter.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:23.150
Anyone bake bread here?

00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:26.430
Do I have any bread bakers?

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:28.470
You know sourdough bread?

00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.770
Sourdough bread is
always started by

00:50:32.770 --> 00:50:34.840
the same yeast strain.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.930
They'll actually preserve the
yeast from batch to batch, and

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:41.250
they will seed the next batch
with the yeast from it.

00:50:41.250 --> 00:50:44.860
Because yeast is really what
contributes most of the flavor

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:45.610
to these things.

00:50:45.610 --> 00:50:50.590
And sour mash just means that
they will seed it with a batch

00:50:50.590 --> 00:50:53.680
from the previous distillation
or fermentation, rather.

00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.140
Yeah?

00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:56.900
AUDIENCE: You said earlier
bourbon is whisky, but you

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:59.770
also can also age whisky
in bourbon casks.

00:50:59.770 --> 00:51:00.145
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes.

00:51:00.145 --> 00:51:02.270
AUDIENCE: Are you just reusing
the cask repeatedly?

00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.750
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes.

00:51:02.750 --> 00:51:06.030
So bourbon whisky now, in order
to be called bourbon,

00:51:06.030 --> 00:51:09.110
you have to be made in
the United States,

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:12.180
as opposed to Scotland.

00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:13.570
Not Bourbon County, folks.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.290
It just is the United States.

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:18.120
And the base grain in
bourbon is corn.

00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:19.200
Because that's our base grain.

00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:20.970
That's what we have here
in this country.

00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:23.010
So bourbon is a whisky.

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:27.320
Bourbon has to be made
in new casks by law.

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.480
You don't make bourbon in
a cask that was used for

00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.450
something else.

00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.820
Brand new American oak casks.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.710
So when you're done making the
bourbon, you only have two

00:51:37.710 --> 00:51:39.180
things you can do
with that cask.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.550
You can throw it out, or you can
sell it to a scotch whisky

00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:45.420
manufacturer.

00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:49.014
Because bourbon can only
use new casks.

00:51:49.014 --> 00:51:50.942
AUDIENCE: Did you have to get
some kind of license to

00:51:50.942 --> 00:51:52.388
operate that still?

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:58.360
ANTHONY CAPORALE: If it's bigger
than one gallon, which

00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:01.870
this is not, or if it's not
being used in a laboratory or

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:04.530
educational setting, then you
need to have a distilling

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:05.790
license to operate it.

00:52:05.790 --> 00:52:07.078
AUDIENCE: So, [INAUDIBLE]
a laboratory

00:52:07.078 --> 00:52:10.042
or educational setting.

00:52:10.042 --> 00:52:12.018
What's considered a laboratory
or [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:12.018 --> 00:52:13.006
educational setting?

00:52:13.006 --> 00:52:13.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:14.990
ANTHONY CAPORALE: It's
a good question.

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.240
You probably don't have one.

00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:20.845
You probably don't have one.

00:52:20.845 --> 00:52:22.165
This would be considered
a laboratory

00:52:22.165 --> 00:52:23.250
or educational setting.

00:52:23.250 --> 00:52:24.550
A school would be considered
a laboratory

00:52:24.550 --> 00:52:25.610
or educational setting.

00:52:25.610 --> 00:52:28.040
A laboratory would be considered
a laboratory or

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:31.074
educational setting.

00:52:31.074 --> 00:52:33.020
AUDIENCE: What about
filtration?

00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.045
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Filtration of--

00:52:34.045 --> 00:52:36.220
AUDIENCE: Of scotch,
do they do that?

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.790
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah, so--

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:39.510
in other words, do they do
it, how do they do it.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:40.360
AUDIENCE: They do something
that's like filters,

00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.750
[INAUDIBLE] talk about.

00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:42.260
ANTHONY CAPORALE: I'm sorry?

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:42.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.870
They'll talk about that as
a sort of evil thing.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:45.300
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:49.530
So filtration, there's two
theories of filtration.

00:52:49.530 --> 00:52:52.250
One is that it's totally fine,
and it's a good thing because

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:53.220
it clarifies the liquid.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:55.580
And two is that it completely
ruins the scotch, and don't

00:52:55.580 --> 00:52:56.840
ever do it, right?

00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.190
So all we're trying to do with
filtration is remove solid

00:53:00.190 --> 00:53:01.890
particulates from the scotch.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:02.980
And there are a bunch
of different ways

00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:03.510
that they do it.

00:53:03.510 --> 00:53:04.330
They can add pectin.

00:53:04.330 --> 00:53:06.770
They can do chill filtration.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.140
I personally think that it will
remove a little bit of

00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.420
the character from the scotch.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.870
But I've had tons and tons
of filtered scotches.

00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:17.180
Most of the scotches that we've
all had in our lives

00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:19.090
have been filtered, and
they're delicious.

00:53:19.090 --> 00:53:20.560
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.470
But the scotch purists will tell
you that they're not fans

00:53:23.470 --> 00:53:24.720
of filtered scotch.

00:53:26.830 --> 00:53:30.810
AUDIENCE: Do you know what
causes the flavors from the

00:53:30.810 --> 00:53:33.070
grain, is it the water, or the
barley, or is it the mixture?

00:53:33.070 --> 00:53:34.124
ANTHONY CAPORALE: I'm sorry?

00:53:34.124 --> 00:53:35.606
AUDIENCE: What causes the
different flavors, depending

00:53:35.606 --> 00:53:37.900
on where it is in Scotland?

00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.260
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.330
What causes the different
flavors, really, really good.

00:53:41.330 --> 00:53:43.610
So, let's go to the map.

00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.720
So this is our scotch regions.

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:49.740
This is the Highlands.

00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:51.120
This is Speyside.

00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:54.810
This is the Lowlands,
Campbeltown, and Islay.

00:53:54.810 --> 00:53:58.740
So Islay, you can see are
all island regions.

00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:01.920
So what causes the flavor that's
characteristic to the

00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:05.420
Islay scotches is one, peat.

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.870
There are no forests
on the coast.

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:08.530
There's only peat bogs.

00:54:08.530 --> 00:54:10.790
So when they do the malting
process and they dry the

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:13.440
barley, they're using peat
to light those flames.

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:14.510
That's number one.

00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:19.590
Number two, all of the air here
is full of salt, right?

00:54:19.590 --> 00:54:20.790
Because you're on the coast.

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:24.240
And that salted air will
permeate the casks, because

00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:28.870
wood is porous, and get into
the casks and impart a

00:54:28.870 --> 00:54:30.620
saltiness to the scotch.

00:54:30.620 --> 00:54:33.740
If you go into the Highlands
now, this is a much more

00:54:33.740 --> 00:54:36.150
forested, wooded area.

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:39.970
The water is much cleaner and
purer than you're going to get

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:40.910
on the coast.

00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:44.610
You guys have all had water in
Florida, or Virginia Beach, or

00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:45.560
the Hamptons.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.550
Totally different character
from water that's

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:49.860
from upstate New York.

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:51.900
Exact same thing
going on here.

00:54:51.900 --> 00:54:55.750
Also, the vegetation is very
different in these regions.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:59.220
And you've heard the term
terroir with wine.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.610
It has to do with if you boil
down to the science of what

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.530
terroir is, it's the
local chemicals.

00:55:05.530 --> 00:55:09.840
It's things in the local plants,
things in the local

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:12.260
soil, mineral formations.

00:55:12.260 --> 00:55:14.850
All those things that vary from
region to region, whether

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:16.860
it's clay soil, whether
it's rocky soil,

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:18.070
whether it's sandy soil.

00:55:18.070 --> 00:55:21.870
So all of these things are going
to manifest themselves,

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:25.560
not only in the water, but in
the actual grain and sometimes

00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.190
in the air, and in the wood.

00:55:27.190 --> 00:55:30.150
So all of that will combine
to change the

00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:33.394
character of the scotch.

00:55:33.394 --> 00:55:35.060
AUDIENCE: I think I missed
something about the

00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:35.774
distillation.

00:55:35.774 --> 00:55:38.154
So you said that the output
there is almost

00:55:38.154 --> 00:55:40.550
100% alcohol, right?

00:55:40.550 --> 00:55:41.720
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Here, not quite.

00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:43.100
But, let's pretend.

00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:46.730
AUDIENCE: But then how do
you get to the 40%?

00:55:46.730 --> 00:55:48.090
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Good question.

00:55:48.090 --> 00:55:49.810
Really good question,
great question.

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:50.900
You didn't miss it.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:52.540
I skipped it because we're
trying to do this in a short

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.340
amount of time.

00:55:53.340 --> 00:55:56.560
When you pull it out of the
barrel, it will come out of

00:55:56.560 --> 00:56:05.910
the barrel at, let's call it 115
to 120 proof, 60% alcohol.

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:10.930
You then will take it and add
water to that whisky that you

00:56:10.930 --> 00:56:12.340
pulled out of the barrel
before you

00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:14.100
put it in the bottle.

00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:16.240
You'll actually, what
they call reduce

00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.300
it, by adding water.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:21.750
That water that you add will
also affect the flavor.

00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:25.790
It used to be that you were
making scotch up here.

00:56:25.790 --> 00:56:27.280
You would pull the scotch
out of the barrel.

00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:30.150
You would add water from this
region into the bottle, and

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:31.630
then you would ship it.

00:56:31.630 --> 00:56:33.980
What they do now, unfortunately,
is they take

00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:34.840
the scotch from here.

00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.730
They put in a tanker truck.

00:56:36.730 --> 00:56:39.530
And then they ship it
down to Glasgow.

00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:41.520
And then they take scotch from
here, they put it in a tanker

00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:43.900
truck, and they ship
it down to Glasgow.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:47.660
Once it gets to Glasgow, they
take Glaswegian water, fill up

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:50.320
the bottles, and then ship it
to the rest of the world.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:52.550
Because it's a lot
cheaper that way.

00:56:52.550 --> 00:56:54.430
OK, but really, really
good question.

00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:56.510
So we're always adding
water before we put

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:57.415
it back in the bottle.

00:56:57.415 --> 00:56:59.350
AUDIENCE: What regulation
is there for that?

00:56:59.350 --> 00:57:01.010
ANTHONY CAPORALE: There is
no regulation for that.

00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:03.665
And I'm not supposed to tell you
that, but I love you guys.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:08.280
It's one of the dirty
secrets of scotch.

00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.750
AUDIENCE: How do you make sure
there's no methanol in there?

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:14.550
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Very,
very good question.

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:16.350
So the methanol is actually
going to be in the

00:57:16.350 --> 00:57:17.730
heads and the tails.

00:57:17.730 --> 00:57:20.780
So the question is how do you
make sure there's no methanol,

00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.400
which is wood alcohol.

00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.342
And there is.

00:57:23.342 --> 00:57:25.090
It will be in the heads
and the tails.

00:57:25.090 --> 00:57:27.690
So you have to be very
careful what you cut.

00:57:27.690 --> 00:57:29.640
It's one of the things you have
to make sure that you're

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.420
not including methanol
in your cut.

00:57:31.420 --> 00:57:33.820
AUDIENCE: So the producers
have a test probably,

00:57:33.820 --> 00:57:34.780
afterwards?

00:57:34.780 --> 00:57:35.110
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yeah.

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:38.220
And they're actually
ridiculous at it.

00:57:38.220 --> 00:57:41.110
These guys, they can
tell by smell.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:44.490
These guys have been doing this
for like 40, 50 years.

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:47.140
What they'll do is at some
point in the distillation

00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:50.800
process, there's an
open container.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.400
And they'll actually
dip and smell.

00:57:53.400 --> 00:57:54.830
You would think that
they would be doing

00:57:54.830 --> 00:57:57.230
like a chemical test.

00:57:57.230 --> 00:58:00.190
I was hoping they were doing a
chemical-- but they're not.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:04.190
They can actually smell, and
they'll know where in the cut

00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:06.270
they are just by smell.

00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:08.965
It's really, it's crazy.

00:58:08.965 --> 00:58:10.390
AUDIENCE: Well now, I
have two questions.

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:13.240
So why is it in the head and
the tail, instead of one

00:58:13.240 --> 00:58:14.660
according to the boiling?

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.610
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
No, it's not.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.120
Methanol is going
to be in the--

00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.140
I'm going to get this wrong.

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.130
I think methanol is going
to be in the tails.

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:25.430
It's one or the other.

00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:27.620
I forget which one
it is though.

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.410
What's that?

00:58:28.410 --> 00:58:30.600
AUDIENCE: --region water thing,
so we can taste the

00:58:30.600 --> 00:58:30.770
difference?

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:31.270
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Is what?

00:58:31.270 --> 00:58:33.174
AUDIENCE: Are there any brands
that don't use the Glaswegian

00:58:33.174 --> 00:58:35.080
water so we can taste
the difference?

00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.981
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Edradour
doesn't.

00:58:36.981 --> 00:58:37.843
And--

00:58:37.843 --> 00:58:40.140
AUDIENCE:Talisker insisted
that they use--

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:40.590
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Right.

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:41.430
Talisker doesn't.

00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:43.050
There's a few brands
that don't, but the

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:45.793
majority of them do.

00:58:45.793 --> 00:58:47.482
AUDIENCE: Where are you getting
the ABV, are you using

00:58:47.482 --> 00:58:48.950
a hydrometer, a refractometer?

00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:49.900
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes.

00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:52.702
They're using a hydrometer.

00:58:52.702 --> 00:58:55.630
AUDIENCE: So wine usually
ages in the bottles.

00:58:55.630 --> 00:58:59.046
Does whisky have that
aging quality?

00:58:59.046 --> 00:59:01.974
So once the whisky's put in the
bottle, does it over time

00:59:01.974 --> 00:59:04.440
get [INAUDIBLE] character,
or not really?

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:07.360
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Once you put
in a bottle, it becomes

00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.260
completely non-reactive.

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:10.940
Was that your question?

00:59:10.940 --> 00:59:12.495
AUDIENCE: But wine, for example,
you also put it in

00:59:12.495 --> 00:59:14.718
the bottle, and it doesn't
really react, but what happens

00:59:14.718 --> 00:59:16.694
is there are substances
which break down, and

00:59:16.694 --> 00:59:18.176
that's how it ages.

00:59:18.176 --> 00:59:21.140
So does whisky have anything
like that?

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:21.760
ANTHONY CAPORALE: No.

00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:24.910
Once you put whisky in a bottle,
everything stops.

00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:26.600
So whisky can last--

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:30.730
unlike wine, whisky actually
will last almost indefinitely

00:59:30.730 --> 00:59:32.075
if it's sealed properly
in a bottle.

00:59:32.075 --> 00:59:35.450
It's completely non-reactive
once it's in the bottle.

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:37.610
It has to do with the fact that
there's less solids in

00:59:37.610 --> 00:59:40.290
it, and there's much higher
alcohol content.

00:59:40.290 --> 00:59:43.120
If you're familiar with things
like port and sherry, which

00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.650
are what we call fortified wines
where they actually add

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:49.490
alcohol back to the wine, the
reason they do that is so that

00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:51.860
when you put it in a bottle, it
will last longer, and then

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:53.070
you can ship it.

00:59:53.070 --> 00:59:57.670
Port and sherry was actually
developed for shipping, some

00:59:57.670 --> 00:59:59.310
of the first products that were
specifically developed

00:59:59.310 --> 01:00:00.550
for export.

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:01.680
And that's one of
the reasons why.

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.900
You increase the alcohol
content, it lasts longer in

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.841
the bottle.

01:00:04.841 --> 01:00:06.314
AUDIENCE: You may have
said this earlier.

01:00:06.314 --> 01:00:10.242
But I see Drambuie on
the logo, so where

01:00:10.242 --> 01:00:12.210
does that come in?

01:00:12.210 --> 01:00:12.880
ANTHONY CAPORALE:
Great question.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.200
I probably should have talked
about that more,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.720
since that's my brand.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:20.430
So Drambuie, just so that you
know, I am the national brand

01:00:20.430 --> 01:00:21.630
ambassador for Drambuie.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:26.070
Drambuie is a scotch liqueur,
which means it's scotch that

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:28.760
has sugar or some sweetener--

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.130
in our case, honey--

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.080
and spices.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.440
So we have liquors or spirits,
which is what we were talking

01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:35.580
about-- whiskies--

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:39.680
so rum, vodka, gin, whisky.

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:42.810
All those things are liquors,
or spirits.

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:45.910
Then we have liqueurs or
cordials, which are

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:48.450
essentially spirits that
have sweetener and

01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:49.590
flavors added to them.

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:52.010
And those are things like
Frangelico, Chambord,

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:55.260
Cointreau, Gran Marnier,
and Drambuie.

01:00:55.260 --> 01:00:57.970
So you have to have flavoring
and sweetener in order to be

01:00:57.970 --> 01:01:01.450
called a liqueur or cordial,
interchangeable.

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:04.330
Drambuie happens to be a
scotch-based liqueur.

01:01:04.330 --> 01:01:08.470
So it is a blended scotch, 80
proof, blended scotch just

01:01:08.470 --> 01:01:09.430
like Dewar's.

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.270
And we add heather honey
and a proprietary blend

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:13.600
of herbs and spices.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:15.760
And you will taste
that upstairs.

01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.580
And you can taste it straight,
and we also have cocktails.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:23.120
And we also have a new product
called Drambuie 15, which is a

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:29.200
15-year-old Speyside single
malt, not a blended scotch.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:31.160
It is actually a blend
of single malts.

01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.290
And they're all 15 years old.

01:01:32.290 --> 01:01:33.670
And they're all from Speyside.

01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:36.900
And to that, we then add our
Drambuie elixir, which is the

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:38.110
sweetener and the herbs.

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:41.260
But it is a scotch, and that's
one of the reasons why I'm

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.742
sort of into this whole
scotch thing.

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:45.540
AUDIENCE: If I'm a home beer
brewer, I can make a decent

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:46.772
batch of beer in
a week or two.

01:01:46.772 --> 01:01:49.441
If I am a home distiller, am I
waiting to make three years to

01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:51.030
make something that
tastes drinkable?

01:01:51.030 --> 01:01:51.960
ANTHONY CAPORALE: You're
not allowed to be

01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:53.720
making whisky at home.

01:01:53.720 --> 01:01:54.100
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:55.700
ANTHONY CAPORALE: That's
number one.

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.180
Number two, no.

01:01:58.180 --> 01:02:00.770
You can make your beer.

01:02:00.770 --> 01:02:02.540
You can distill it
very quickly.

01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:05.600
If you want to age it in a cask,
you're probably looking

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:08.390
at about five years.

01:02:08.390 --> 01:02:08.800
I don't know.

01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.570
I've never tried it.

01:02:09.570 --> 01:02:10.907
I swear though.

01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:12.815
AUDIENCE: Will you tell us a
little bit about you know,

01:02:12.815 --> 01:02:15.680
some people say drink it
on the rocks, versus--

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.550
ANTHONY CAPORALE: Yes, good.

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:18.610
Guys, you got do me a favor.

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.480
If you really want to learn more
about this than I can do

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:22.070
in an hour, take
my class at the

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:23.170
Institute of Culinary Education.

01:02:23.170 --> 01:02:24.330
We do three hours of this.

01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:25.660
You taste 35 different
whiskies.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.740
It's really, really great.

01:02:27.740 --> 01:02:30.210
And I will get even
deeper into this.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.070
But one of the things that I
will tell you, when you taste

01:02:33.070 --> 01:02:37.390
spirits, particularly whiskies,
please open them up.

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:39.380
So that means add
water to them.

01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.670
So if you have ever have-- if
any of you guys have a friend

01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:43.130
when you go out and you
order whisky, and

01:02:43.130 --> 01:02:44.420
then you look at them.

01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.540
And you want ice, but you won't
because you're with

01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:48.370
them, and you know they're going
to laugh, don't hang out

01:02:48.370 --> 01:02:49.810
with that person anymore.

01:02:49.810 --> 01:02:52.010
Because they don't have your
best interests at heart.

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:53.380
I want you to add water.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:56.870
When you do tastings with
distillers, with the guys who

01:02:56.870 --> 01:03:00.770
make this stuff, if you sit down
at a distillery with the

01:03:00.770 --> 01:03:03.190
master distiller, he's going to
give you a glass of whisky,

01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:06.560
a glass of water, and
a medicine dropper.

01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:09.370
And he wants you to add
water to the whisky.

01:03:09.370 --> 01:03:09.780
All right?

01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:13.990
80 proof is a number that we
came up with for shipping, not

01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:15.470
for drinking.

01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:15.930
OK?

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:17.020
It's for shipping.

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:18.790
We want you to open it up.

01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:20.280
So add water, add ice.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:24.790
I tell people up to equal
parts water is fine.

01:03:24.790 --> 01:03:28.330
If you drink 80 proof whisky,
your mouth, it burns.

01:03:28.330 --> 01:03:28.940
It does.

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.340
And it's supposed to.

01:03:30.340 --> 01:03:31.590
Because it's toxic, remember?

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:32.970
I put that up early on.

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:33.790
It's toxic.

01:03:33.790 --> 01:03:37.520
So what you'll see is if you
do this with a master

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.870
distiller, you put a drop of
water, and then you taste it.

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:41.850
Then you put another drop of
water, and you taste it.

01:03:41.850 --> 01:03:43.450
And you keep doing that.

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:46.610
One drop along the line, all of
a sudden the burn's going

01:03:46.610 --> 01:03:47.250
to go away.

01:03:47.250 --> 01:03:48.890
It's just going to shut off.

01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:50.320
It may be 12 drops for you.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.880
It may be 20 drops for you.

01:03:51.880 --> 01:03:55.190
But it's going to be the same
every time for each person.

01:03:55.190 --> 01:03:57.510
And that's called your
alcohol threshold.

01:03:57.510 --> 01:03:59.500
So what they ask you to do is
write that number down.

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:01.130
And then the next time they
give you sample, put those

01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:03.110
number of drops in and
then taste it.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:03.420
OK?

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.420
Because if you don't do that,
you're not tasting anything.

01:04:06.420 --> 01:04:10.320
All your tongue is telling you
is, this is poison, spit it

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.670
out, please.

01:04:11.670 --> 01:04:12.990
We don't want that.

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:14.440
So add water.

01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:15.480
I add ice.

01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:18.230
I only drink whisky
with full rocks.

01:04:18.230 --> 01:04:19.890
That's how I like it.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:21.760
And believe me, I know
what I'm doing.

01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:25.360
So please, water and
ice to taste.

01:04:25.360 --> 01:04:28.290
There's nothing wrong with
drinking what we call neat,

01:04:28.290 --> 01:04:30.140
which is right from the
bottle into the glass.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.010
That's fine.

01:04:31.010 --> 01:04:33.670
But if you don't enjoy that--
and most people don't--

01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.390
please, please, please
add water, add ice,

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:37.510
until you enjoy it.

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:38.830
That's what we want you to do.

01:04:38.830 --> 01:04:40.530
Thanks for asking that.

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:41.695
Anything else?

01:04:41.695 --> 01:04:43.810
You guys thirsty?

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:45.230
Let's go.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:51.803
[APPLAUSE]
