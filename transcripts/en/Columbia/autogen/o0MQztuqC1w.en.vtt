we've been learning over the years is

we've been learning over the years is

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of distortions well
 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.780 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of distortions well

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 align:start position:0%

that<00:04:07.850><c> will</c><00:04:08.150><c> correct</c><00:04:08.600><c> and</c><00:04:09.050><c> those</c><00:04:09.440><c> distortions</c>

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:09.770 align:start position:0%
that will correct and those distortions
 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.710 align:start position:0%
that will correct and those distortions
and<00:04:10.100><c> confront</c><00:04:10.550><c> distortions</c><00:04:11.150><c> a</c><00:04:11.240><c> little</c><00:04:11.480><c> bit</c><00:04:12.370><c> um</c>
