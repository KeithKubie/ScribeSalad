00:00:00.586 --> 00:00:02.311
- [Voiceover] Let's say
that something is traveling

00:00:02.311 --> 00:00:06.616
at a constant rate of
five meters per second.

00:00:06.616 --> 00:00:08.604
That's its velocity in one dimension.

00:00:08.604 --> 00:00:10.186
If it was negative, we'd
be moving to the left.

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:12.809
If it's positive, it's
moving to the right.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.809
Let's say that we care
about what is our change

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:22.916
in distance over, the delta
symbol represents change,

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:27.887
over a change in time of four seconds.

00:00:27.887 --> 00:00:28.936
Over four seconds.

00:00:28.936 --> 00:00:33.936
I could say from t equal
zero to t is equal to four.

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:35.368
That's our change in time.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:38.589
That's our four-second
interval that we care about.

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.006
Well, one way to think
about it is what a rate

00:00:43.006 --> 00:00:46.761
by definition is nothing but
a change in some quantity.

00:00:46.761 --> 00:00:50.280
In this case, it's distance over

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.299
a change in some other quantity.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.979
In this case, we're thinking about time.

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:55.648
Or another way to think
about it, if we multiply

00:00:55.648 --> 00:00:59.339
both sides times change in
time, you get your change

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.339
in distance is equal to your
rate times change in time.

00:01:08.624 --> 00:01:10.690
This is very close to
you, you might remember

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:12.776
from pre-algebra, distance
is equal to rate times time.

00:01:12.776 --> 00:01:15.117
Time, that just comes from the
definition of what a rate is.

00:01:15.117 --> 00:01:17.365
It's a change in one quantity

00:01:17.365 --> 00:01:20.741
with respect to another quantity.

00:01:20.741 --> 00:01:22.028
If you just apply this, you can say,

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:24.596
"Okay, my rate is a constant five meters

00:01:24.596 --> 00:01:29.596
"per second and my delta
t is four seconds."

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:33.090
So times four seconds.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.023
Well, that's just going to give you 20.

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.123
That's just going to get you 20.

00:01:38.123 --> 00:01:39.213
Let me do that in same color

00:01:39.213 --> 00:01:42.227
that I had for the change in distance.

00:01:42.227 --> 00:01:44.262
That's going to be 20.

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:47.615
Then the seconds, cancel
the seconds, 20 meters.

00:01:47.615 --> 00:01:49.498
So my total change in distance over those

00:01:49.498 --> 00:01:52.446
four seconds is going to be 20 meters.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:53.318
Nothing new here.

00:01:53.318 --> 00:01:54.908
Nothing too fancy.

00:01:54.908 --> 00:01:57.175
But I want to do now is
connect this to the area

00:01:57.175 --> 00:02:00.254
under the rate function
over this time period.

00:02:00.254 --> 00:02:02.197
So let's graph that.

00:02:02.197 --> 00:02:04.139
Let's graph it.

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:07.116
That's my rate axis.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:10.211
This is my time axis.

00:02:10.211 --> 00:02:11.623
This is going to be in seconds.

00:02:11.623 --> 00:02:15.143
This is going to be in meters per second.

00:02:15.143 --> 00:02:20.143
Let's see, one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.819
Let's see if it's about enough,

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.903
and then I go one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:25.903 --> 00:02:29.145
Our rate, at least in this
example, is a constant, is

00:02:29.145 --> 00:02:32.000
a constant five meters per second.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.316
It's a constant five meters per second.

00:02:34.316 --> 00:02:38.584
That is my r of t in this example.

00:02:38.584 --> 00:02:39.897
What did we just do here?

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:41.434
We just multiplied our change in time

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:43.017
times our constant rate.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:45.130
We just multiplied our change in time.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.858
So from time equal zero
seconds to four seconds.

00:02:47.858 --> 00:02:49.451
It's this length here,

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.988
if we think on that axis.

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:53.275
Now we multiply it
times our constant rate.

00:02:53.275 --> 00:02:56.481
We multiply it times this right over here.

00:02:56.481 --> 00:02:58.524
If I multiply this base times this height,

00:02:58.524 --> 00:03:00.200
what am I going to get?

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.200
I'm going to get this area
under the rate function.

00:03:08.005 --> 00:03:11.234
Now that area is going to be 20.

00:03:11.234 --> 00:03:13.612
If we went with the units of
them, obviously you're used

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:16.059
to things of area being
something units squared

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.025
because it's usually meters times meters

00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:22.223
or miles times miles or inches
times inches so it'll be

00:03:22.223 --> 00:03:26.371
inches squared, meters
squared, or miles squared.

00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:28.901
But here if we go at the units
of the axis of the meters

00:03:28.901 --> 00:03:32.545
per second times seconds which
is going to get you meters.

00:03:32.545 --> 00:03:33.895
But the important thing here is

00:03:33.895 --> 00:03:36.991
that the units here or
the area here is 20.

00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:40.464
So this for that very simple
example, it looks like the area

00:03:40.464 --> 00:03:43.774
under the rate curve is
equal to the net change

00:03:43.774 --> 00:03:47.125
over that time period where the rate is

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:52.125
something with respect to time.

00:03:53.118 --> 00:03:54.222
Well let's test the little burrow.

00:03:54.222 --> 00:03:56.695
It's just going to be more intuition here.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.152
Let's say that we have a
different rate function.

00:03:59.152 --> 00:04:02.853
Let's say that we will
make with the different,

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:06.040
let's say instead we had a rate function.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.832
I'll use on this yellow.

00:04:07.832 --> 00:04:11.959
Let's say on a rate function, that is...

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.665
Let me make it a little bit interesting.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.882
Let's say it's one meter per second,

00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:20.419
for our time is zero is
less than or equal to time

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.348
which is less than or
equal to two seconds.

00:04:24.348 --> 00:04:27.020
Honestly, this is all in
seconds where we're of time.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.044
There's two meters per second,

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:31.632
for t is greater than two seconds.

00:04:31.632 --> 00:04:32.735
What's that going to look like?

00:04:32.735 --> 00:04:34.935
Actually, try to graph it
yourself, and just say,

00:04:34.935 --> 00:04:37.262
"Well, what is the
total change in distance

00:04:37.262 --> 00:04:41.930
"over the first, let's say five seconds?"

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.087
We want to do delta t over, not the first

00:04:44.087 --> 00:04:46.823
four seconds but the first five seconds.

00:04:46.823 --> 00:04:48.921
Well, let's graph it.

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.036
Let's graph it.

00:04:51.036 --> 00:04:55.680
So this is one meter per second.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.969
One meter per second.

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:58.777
That is two meters per second.

00:04:58.777 --> 00:05:00.535
That's in meters per second.

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:03.581
That's my rate axis.

00:05:05.596 --> 00:05:10.596
This right over there is
going to be my time axis.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.461
One, they're obviously
not of the same scale,

00:05:14.461 --> 00:05:16.735
three, four, five.

00:05:16.735 --> 00:05:19.289
What is this rate function look like?

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.320
Well, my rate is one meter per second

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.673
between time is zero and
two, including two seconds,

00:05:25.673 --> 00:05:27.365
and then the rate jumps.

00:05:27.365 --> 00:05:29.926
Nothing can accelerate
instantly like this.

00:05:29.926 --> 00:05:32.058
You'd need an infinite
force or an infinitely

00:05:32.058 --> 00:05:33.931
small mass I guess to, or maybe there's

00:05:33.931 --> 00:05:35.329
something that's thinking about...

00:05:35.329 --> 00:05:37.029
Anyway, I only get two complex here

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:40.206
but this is unrealistic mode.

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:44.104
It's not typical for something
to just have spontaneous

00:05:44.104 --> 00:05:48.634
velocity increase like that
but let's just go with it.

00:05:50.064 --> 00:05:52.909
Then after the two seconds, we are

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:57.909
at a constant rate of
two meters per second.

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:00.731
Now, what is our total change in distance

00:06:00.731 --> 00:06:03.130
over the first five seconds here?

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.607
So here, we care about
the first five seconds,

00:06:05.607 --> 00:06:07.174
or we can break up the problem.

00:06:07.174 --> 00:06:10.092
We could say, "Well, over
the first two seconds."

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:12.450
Change in time is two seconds,

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:16.087
times our constant rate
over those two seconds.

00:06:16.087 --> 00:06:19.756
It's going to be two seconds
times one meter per second.

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:23.928
Well, that's going to give us two meters.

00:06:23.928 --> 00:06:25.586
So this here is going to be,

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:27.476
shall we do that in orange color,

00:06:27.476 --> 00:06:29.323
that's going to give us two meters there,

00:06:29.323 --> 00:06:31.138
and then we look at the next section.

00:06:31.138 --> 00:06:34.558
Our change in time here is three seconds,

00:06:34.558 --> 00:06:36.965
and then we multiply
that, times our constant

00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:38.881
two meters per second.

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.230
That's going to give us an area of six.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.839
If we look at the units, in both cases,

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:47.563
we're multiplying seconds times meters

00:06:47.563 --> 00:06:51.041
per second which is
going to give us meters.

00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:55.843
This is going to be two plus
six meters or eight meters.

00:06:55.843 --> 00:06:59.307
So hopefully this is giving
you the intuition that the area

00:06:59.307 --> 00:07:02.879
under the rate curve
or the rate function is

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:06.220
going to give you our total
net change in whatever

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.880
that rate thing was finding the rate of.

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:12.225
In this case, it is
distance per unit time.

00:07:12.225 --> 00:07:16.060
If you take the area
under the rate function,

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.319
that kind of distance for
the speed or this velocity

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.368
function over some period
of time, that area is

00:07:22.368 --> 00:07:26.836
going to be our total
net change in distance.
