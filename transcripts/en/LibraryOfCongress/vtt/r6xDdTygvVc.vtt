David Cline: I’m just going to record a
little brief announcement just for the tape,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.049
so we have a record of that, and then we’ll
just start talking.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.379
So, are you ready?

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.869
Harry Blake: Ready!

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:19.369
David Cline: Fantastic!

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.359
John Bishop: You’re on.

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.859
David Cline: Okay.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.480
Today is October the third, 2013.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.910
We are in Shreveport, Louisiana, in the beautiful
sanctuary of the Mount Canaan Baptist Church

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.470
with the Reverend Doctor Harry Blake.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.470
Good morning.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:34.470
Harry Blake: Good morning.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.470
Good to have you here.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.470
David Cline: Thank you so much.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.470
Harry Blake: Welcome to the hood.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:39.470
[Laughs]
David Cline: [Laughs] Thank you, thank you.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.030
This is David Cline talking, of the Virginia
Tech History Department, and also working

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.870
with the Southern Oral History Program at
UNC-Chapel Hill.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.310
And we are here on behalf of the Civil Rights
History Project of the National Museum of

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.140
African American History and Culture of the
Smithsonian and the Library of Congress.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.240
Behind the camera today is John Bishop of
Media Generation and UCLA.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.170
So, again, thank you so much for being part
of this project.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.560
We really appreciate your time and your willingness
to be part of this.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.250
Harry Blake: Really, it’s extremely gratifying
to have you here.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.830
David Cline: Well, thank you so much.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:24.330
Where I’d like to start, if you would, is
if you could just tell us a bit about your

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.620
upbringing and your people and where you came
from.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.620
Harry Blake: Okay.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.440
David Cline: And we’ll try and tie that
into a conversation about the work you’ve

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.530
done on behalf of African American people
and the Civil Rights Movement.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.900
Harry Blake: Good.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.710
My parents—my daddy was born in Mississippi,
and my mother was born in Arkansas.

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.490
And I was born in Arkansas, but being the
land of opportunity, the first opportunity

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.650
my parents got, they seized it and got me
out of Arkansas and brought me to Louisiana,

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.280
very, very young.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.400
My background is that of a plantation.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.890
My daddy was a sharecropper who could not
read or write.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.679
I think my mother finished third grade.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.470
So, I was reared and lived on a plantation.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.499
Having been born in 1934, I lived on a plantation
until I was 24 years old, finished college.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:27.680
That was the year I finished college that
I like to say I was liberated from the plantation.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.340
My wife liberated me from the plantation.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.400
Went to a one-room church school.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.510
It was a public school.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.400
I guess you can describe it this way: the
plantation owner established a school in a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.260
church building for first through seventh
grades.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.499
And that teacher was not really a college
graduate.

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:01.870
She was a college sophomore.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:09.779
She taught first through seventh grades, every
subject, so obviously was not a lot she could

00:03:09.779 --> 00:03:10.779
do.

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:11.779
0003

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:18.409
So, I was almost a teenager before I learned
to read and write.

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:24.499
I was promoted to junior high, I guess you
would say, eighth grade, and that was my first

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:34.060
encounter with the eight parts of speech and
other things, because I was behind.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.519
But I struggled to catch up.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:39.870
And, as a matter of fact, my whole life has
been a life of trying to catch up.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:46.230
And by the time I’ve caught up in this century,
here comes technology, and [laughs] I’m

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.700
behind again!

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.019
And technology changes every week!
DC: We all feel that way.

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.879
[Laughs]
HB: Yes, yes, yes, yes!

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.319
I—this may not be meaningful—I plowed
mules.

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:03.390
Here I am, in high school, plowing mules.

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:10.870
And I decided, for some unknown reason, that
I was not going to learn the language of the

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.269
mule.

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.299
I was going to teach the mule my language.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.980
And mule language was, “Whoa!

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.980
Haw!

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.980
Gee!”

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:26.440
And I discovered that it was not in what you
said to the mule that got his attention.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.590
It was the pull of the reins.

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.150
So, when I wanted the mule to stop, I just
said, “Stop,” and I pulled on the reins.

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.539
If I wanted him to go right, I said, “To
the right,” and I pulled on the right reins.

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.949
So, that’s a humorous story, but it’s
true.

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:46.040
I did not learn mule language.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.090
I had intelligent mules.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.919
I taught them my language.

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:50.129
DC: Hmm, um-hmm.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:52.980
HB: That’s the humor of it.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.970
DC: What lesson did you learn there with the
mules?

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.740
How did you apply that later in life, if any
way?

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.240
HB: Let me add this.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.069
My daddy taught me that there was a saying
that, “You can lead a horse to the water,

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:08.879
but that you can’t make it drink.”

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:17.490
My daddy said, [0:05:00] “If you know how
and put enough salt in his diet, he’ll find

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.639
water on his own.”

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:25.820
I learned a powerful lesson from that in my
pastoral ministry.

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:35.009
If I have a project, have a mission that the
church does not see eye-to-eye, I salt the

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.530
diet to make them thirst for what I’m trying
to feed them.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.310
So, that has been very beneficial to me.

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:53.349
I learned also from this mule thing, if you
know how, you can get people to do anything

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:54.860
you want them to do.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:00.530
And I saw examples of that from Jim Jones
and David Koresh.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:09.050
They took lettered people, unlettered people,
rich people, poor people, and led them to

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.280
do whatever they wanted them to do.

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:21.100
Mr. Jim Jones even said to people, “Stand
in line and drink poison,” and they were

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.289
anxious to do that.

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:30.599
So, I think, as a clergy person, you’ve
got to keep your motives right so you can

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:32.770
lead people in a right direction.

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:39.830
But those were some leadership skills that
I kind of learned from the plantation and

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:40.830
from life.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:41.939
DC: Um-hmm.

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.100
And when were you called to the church?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.100
0004

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:53.639
HB: My pastoring—early years of my pastoral
days were in the rural community.

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:57.319
And in this—
DC: I should just pause and ask you where

00:06:57.319 --> 00:07:01.099
exactly was the plantation, if you could tell
us about that, what county it was?

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:02.099
HB: Okay.

00:07:02.099 --> 00:07:05.699
The first—I’ve lived on two plantations.

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:11.759
One was in northeast Louisiana, in Madison
Parish, Tallulah, Louisiana, and the name

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.819
of that plantation was the Ashley Plantation.

00:07:17.819 --> 00:07:26.210
Left there in 1951 and moved to northwest
Louisiana, Shreveport, Caddo Parish, and the

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:33.919
plantation north of Shreveport was the Woodspur
Plantation.

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:37.539
And that’s the plantation that I was liberated
from.

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:43.900
I went to college and after I finished college,
moved to the city limits of Shreveport.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:53.780
So, my first pastorage was in 1958 in Caddo
Parish, a one-Sunday church.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.789
And that was a tradition of the rural areas.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:59.370
Churches did not meet every Sunday.

00:07:59.370 --> 00:08:05.770
Some churches met every other Sunday, for
instance, first and a third Sunday, or a second

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.020
and fourth Sunday.

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:12.770
So, my first church was a one-Sunday church,
first Sunday.

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:20.160
And then I was called to a church closer to
Shreveport, almost in the city limits.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:25.849
It was a first Sunday evening and a third
Sunday morning church.

00:08:25.849 --> 00:08:27.830
Got called to that church.

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:35.150
And then, I got called—just on the line
of Texas, called Bethany, Louisiana, I got

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:40.390
called to a second and fourth Sunday church.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:54.580
By 1966, I was able to turn those two rural
churches full time and to satisfy my conscience,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:00.820
I left both of those churches, because I didn’t
want to go to one or the other, and came to

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:05.480
this church, which was 1966.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:15.300
This church was in the most densely populated
slum area of Shreveport called Allendale.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.570
And I came here.

00:09:18.570 --> 00:09:29.350
Unfortunately, this church was not, in a sense,
as advanced as my rural churches, because

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:33.380
we had air conditioning in the rural church
and pews.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.460
This church did not have air conditioning
at the time, nor pews.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.650
We had benches and all that good stuff.

00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:46.280
The building that I inherited was so dilapidated
that I think a few years after I was here,

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:49.390
it actually collapsed and fell in.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:53.770
And this is the result of that building having
been so dilapidated.

00:09:53.770 --> 00:09:58.360
So, I’ve been here since 1966.

00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.090
What, 47 years this year.

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:02.950
DC: Amazing.

00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:03.950
Wonderful.

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:11.300
So, let’s talk a little bit about—well,
let me ask you first, growing up on the two

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:17.880
plantations, [0:10:00] what was it like for
African American people in that time, as far

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.210
as opportunities available and as far as relationship
with white people?

00:10:23.210 --> 00:10:32.540
HB: Let me respond to the last part of that
question: relationship to white people.

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:43.300
This is interesting, and a lot of people don’t
know this or may not agree.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:53.220
Whites and blacks in a confined, narrow sense
had great relationships.

00:10:53.220 --> 00:11:03.640
For instance, if you were the white man’s
“boy,” you got whatever you needed, with

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.570
certain restrictions.

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:18.800
I remember when World War II, if you were
a good worker on the plantation, you didn’t

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:22.610
get drafted to the military.

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:33.190
One reason is that the farmers were on the
draft board or whatever it’s called, and

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.700
if his Negro’s name came up, got set aside.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:38.700
0005

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.700
I remember this expression.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:45.920
They would say at the end of the week, when
you got that day off to go to town, he’d

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.400
tell you, “Have a good time.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.830
If you stay out of the cemetery,” meaning
don’t get killed, “I’ll keep you out

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:58.790
of jail.”

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:05.440
That meant you could kill another Negro, you
could do whatever you want, just so you don’t

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.680
get into the black, or white area.

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:08.930
“I’ll get you out of jail.”

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:12.760
That’s the kind of relationship.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:20.820
Whites and blacks, in a confined sense, got
along very well.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:29.610
The southern white man—I think perhaps even
today, but in my younger years—would do

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:38.740
anything for “his Negro,” so long as he
felt like he was handing it down to him—

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:39.740
DC: Um-hmm.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.520
HB: But not out to him, not on my—you will
never be my equal.

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:48.630
That’s the way I describe the relationship.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:52.130
DC: And as you say, “his Negro,” so there’s
a sense of—

00:12:52.130 --> 00:12:53.480
HB: That’s right.

00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:55.500
You never forget you are mine.

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.990
And we—and the people who lived on the plantation
were really his Negro—and I’m using the

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:09.600
language that was popular then, Negro—because
if you were a sharecropper, he provided a

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:14.930
hut, a house for you to live in.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:21.630
He provided the food for you to eat, because
he had what they called a commissary, a country

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:31.530
store, that he provided food and implements
for farming and some clothing, work clothing.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:33.450
You got an advance on that.

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.540
He would charge that to your account.

00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:47.280
You had to use his mules to work the crop
and his implements, the plows, the cultivators.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.150
So, he charged that to your account.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:58.190
Now, let’s say you were able to grow 20
bales of cotton.

00:13:58.190 --> 00:14:05.680
Ten of those bales belong to the farmer, the
owner.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:13.630
Ten belong to you, and you paid the expenses
for making those 20 bales out of your income.

00:14:13.630 --> 00:14:22.610
And most of the time, at the end of the year,
he would say to the plantation workers, “You

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.680
did good this year.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680
We broke even.”

00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:32.470
Now, you can’t leave the plantation and
go somewhere else.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:41.290
You could leave the plantation if another
farmer paid him to let you move to his plantation.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:44.740
So, you were always indebted.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.930
You owed your soul to the company store.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:53.710
My daddy, fortunately—I don’t know how
he did it.

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.270
I guess he must have found favor in the white
owner.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:09.000
He always, every year, would make a profit,
maybe $200, not more than $500 a year.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:20.590
And [0:15:00] how we got from northeast Louisiana
to northwest Louisiana, the manager for the

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:28.280
owner of the plantation was offered a job
in north Louisiana, and he was allowed to

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:38.270
bring as many of the Negroes from this plantation
with him, but he paid the owner, so we owed

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:39.360
him.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.190
And you never got out of debt.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.610
You were always in debt.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:54.890
And if I can sneak this in: America is very
much on that style today, because they keep

00:15:54.890 --> 00:15:58.560
us slaves with credit cards.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:01.810
Okay, you asked me another question that I
didn’t address.

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:02.880
I don’t remember what it was.

00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.880
0006

00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.700
DC: Well, I asked about relations with white
people.

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:10.350
But just what it was like, I guess, within
the black community as well at that time,

00:16:10.350 --> 00:16:12.350
how cohesive black communities were.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:17.740
And I also wanted to ask about if anyone was
voting at that time.

00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:20.160
HB: No, no, no, no, no!

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:21.770
No one was voting.

00:16:21.770 --> 00:16:30.170
The plantation that I lived on, when I became
20 years old, no black person was registered.

00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:43.120
There might have been a handful of blacks
in that part of Caddo Parish, Dixie—not

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:51.000
Dixie, but—yeah, maybe Dixie, Belcher, might
have been a handful.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.420
How I got registered at—I believe the age
limit then was 21—how I got registered,

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:12.010
I gave an address of a friend of mine who
lived in the city limits as my address and

00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:20.330
I studied to pass the test that was required
in this state and in this parish.

00:17:20.330 --> 00:17:30.630
So, at 21, though I was still on the plantation,
I became a registered voter.

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:31.630
DC: Hmm.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:35.350
And do you remember what that process was,
what the test was, and going through that

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:36.350
experience?

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:37.350
HB: Oh, yes!

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:38.940
Oh, yes, how well I remember!

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:47.210
First requirement, in order to even apply,
you had to have a registered voter to identify,

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:49.870
prove that you were who you said you were.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:57.290
Now, if only whites are registered, what white
person is going to vouch for you?

00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.290
DC: Okay.

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:01.160
HB: There were a few who would do that.

00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:11.360
The other requirement was you had to have
identification, driver’s license or Social

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.840
Security card.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.190
And now, you have to pass a test.

00:18:18.190 --> 00:18:21.040
What’s the test?

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:30.930
Interpret the Constitution, U.S. Constitution,
to the satisfactory of the voter registrar,

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:34.360
and a Harvard lawyer couldn’t do that.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360
Okay?

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:46.670
If you pass that, now you’ve got to figure
your age, how old I am today in years, in

00:18:46.670 --> 00:18:50.660
months, and days.

00:18:50.660 --> 00:18:56.380
And if you pass that test, they may give you
a card.

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.160
That was true in Louisiana.

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:03.030
In Texas, of course, you had to pay a poll
tax and all that kind of thing.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.050
DC: Um-hmm.

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:05.050
But it was—
JB: Let’s pause.

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.050
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: Okay, we’re back.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:08.450
DC: It only takes a second.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:13.070
So, the—yeah, so it was an incredibly difficult
barrier to pass.

00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.070
0007

00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:16.559
HB: Incredibly difficult, incredibly difficult.

00:19:16.559 --> 00:19:22.500
And that was part of my responsibility when
I joined Martin Luther King’s staff was

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:33.780
to get, to teach voter education, teach people
how to pass the test, and to compute their

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:40.200
age, in terms of years, days, months, to the
date that they were applying to get registered.

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:48.050
DC: Now, speaking of Dr. King, of course,
could you tell us the story of how you felt

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:54.400
drawn to fight for civil rights and how you
met Dr. King and his organization and began

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.700
working with the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference?

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:08.650
HB: Though my daddy could not read and write,
my daddy, as I think about it, was gifted

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.360
in that he knew how [0:20:00] to work the
system.

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:26.940
[Laughs] He, coming up in his era, he knew
he had to pay homage to the white man.

00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:33.570
He’d call him “Cap’n” and “Boss”
and what-have-you.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:40.070
But he knew how to get what he needed to survive.

00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:48.340
He said this to me one day, he said, “You
can call a white man a dog, if you know how,

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.750
and get by with it.”

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:58.240
My daddy always did his teaching by demonstration.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:05.490
The boss bought a new car, and my daddy walked
by the car and said, “Cap’n, this is a

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.490
beautiful car.

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.850
You know you’re a big dog!”

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:13.530
[Laughs] Called him a dog!

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:18.790
He liked it, but he knew how to call him a
dog.

00:21:18.790 --> 00:21:28.220
So, I saw my daddy using techniques to get
what he needed to get, but never diminished

00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:31.030
his manhood.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.720
He never did that.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:46.760
So, my daddy taught me how to be a man and
a proud man, even in the midst of segregation

00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.180
and on the plantation.

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:54.790
So, I knew what I saw happening in America,
particularly where I lived.

00:21:54.790 --> 00:22:00.290
Something was wrong with that.

00:22:00.290 --> 00:22:10.220
And there became a burning inside of me and
a yearning to see what I could do to change

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.770
this.

00:22:11.770 --> 00:22:20.600
I had a wonderful experience about ninth grade.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.140
This is not on the plantation.

00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.190
This is in the little town of Dixie.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:33.440
There were two stores in Dixie and a railroad
station.

00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:42.040
I went to—it must have been the summer of
’52, maybe, ’51 or ‘52—to one of the

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.340
store owners and said to him, “I’d like
to have a summer job.”

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:50.570
His name was H.L. Whitlow.

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:55.830
He said to me, “Well, boy, I just hired
two students.”

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:59.940
They were both college students, one white,
one black.

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:06.840
“And my brother-in-law is working with me
this summer, and I don’t need anybody.

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:08.700
I wish you had come sooner.”

00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:14.170
Well, as I was leaving the store, his wife
said, “Hey, boy, come here!

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.980
I’m going to talk to my husband about hiring
you.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:19.450
I like you.”

00:23:19.450 --> 00:23:26.091
Well, he said to me, “Well, I really don’t
need you, but because my wife likes you, be

00:23:26.091 --> 00:23:33.650
here Monday morning, and I’ll try you out.”

00:23:33.650 --> 00:23:42.300
I was working on the plantation in the field,
and we would go chop cotton, pick cotton.

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:48.390
We’d go to the field at seven o’clock,
get off at five, five days a week.

00:23:48.390 --> 00:23:57.000
Well, when I got this summer job at the Whitlow
store, I had to be there for five-thirty in

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.950
the morning, because the field hands would
stop at his store on their way to the field

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:09.800
to get their, buy their lunch, so I needed
to be there during the rush hour.

00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:10.800
0008

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:17.460
H.L. Whitlow was far ahead of his time as
a white man.

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:23.830
He practiced in the ’50s equal employment
opportunities.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:32.820
He had a white student from Tech working for
him that summer, and a black student from

00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:33.880
Grambling.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:42.830
However, the white student worked in the store,
but the black student was a maid in the house.

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:50.841
Well, to make a long story short, he told
me, “I’m going to try you out, and if

00:24:50.841 --> 00:24:52.830
you—don’t ask me what I’m going to pay
you.

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:55.800
I’ll pay you whatever you’re worth.”

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.290
Well, at the end of the week, he applauded
me.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:00.590
He said, “You’re a good worker.

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:04.060
I like you and I want to keep you on.”

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:13.760
Now, on the plantation, five days a week,
a few hours [0:25:00] per day less, I would

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.420
make $15 a week.

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:25.080
Now, I’m working six days at the store,
start at five-thirty in the morning, get off

00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:27.960
at seven at night.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:33.730
And he said, “I’m going to start you off
with $15.”

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:43.960
I said to him, “You know, I could have worked
one day less, and a few hours less, and made

00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.130
$15.

00:25:45.130 --> 00:25:48.980
And you did say you were going to pay me what
I was worth.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:50.850
You said you liked my work.

00:25:50.850 --> 00:25:54.610
But if that’s all you think I’m worth,
I’m going to donate this week’s work to

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.360
you,” and gave it to him, gave it back.

00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:03.000
And he said to me, “Well, what in hell do
you think you’re worth?”

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.950
And I said, “Well, sir, you couldn’t pay
me what I’m worth, but I wouldn’t work

00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:10.230
for a penny less than $25 a week.”

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:16.550
And he counted out ten more dollars and, as
my mama would say, “chunked” it at me,

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:17.550
threw it at me.

00:26:17.550 --> 00:26:20.770
Well, it was what I asked for, I didn’t
mind him throwing it at me.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:22.429
I just got what I wanted.

00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:30.350
Well, the fortunate thing is, for me, was
he took sick at the end of the summer.

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:34.750
Now, his college students have gone back to
school.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:40.210
He sends his wife to my daddy’s house and
say, “The school house that Harry would

00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:45.000
catch at his house comes by the store.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:52.610
Let Harry drive, before he goes to school,
your car, and work an hour before school and

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:55.970
work after school, and we’ll make it worthwhile.”

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:02.429
Well, I’m part time in school, and he pays
me $25 a week.

00:27:02.429 --> 00:27:12.090
Now, the next summer, he can’t pay me $25
a week, and the next summer I was paid $40.

00:27:12.090 --> 00:27:19.930
When I finished high school, I was making
$300 a month, and no black citizen in the

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:24.160
rural was making that kind of money.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:31.880
H.L. Whitlow and my daddy were the two most
influential men in my life.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:46.540
He was called by his white friends a “nigger-lover”
because he believed in treating people fairly.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.640
And he made such an impression on my life
that I still talk about him.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640
DC: Um-hmm.

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.110
Do you think he ran a risk doing that?

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:56.679
HB: Oh, yes, he did.

00:27:56.679 --> 00:27:57.940
He ran a risk.

00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:58.940
He did.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.480
But he was a Christian and he had money.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.230
And in America, money talks.

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.540
DC: So, he could get away with it?

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:08.540
0009

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.540
HB: He could get away with it, yes.

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:10.730
DC: So—
JB: Pause.

00:28:10.730 --> 00:28:13.500
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: We’re back.

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:19.670
DC: So, if you see that as a, you know, crucial
part in your journey about how people treat

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:25.640
one another and the rights and how to demand
the rights, what would be the next step in

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640
that journey?

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:27.640
HB: Let me add this, and then I’ll answer
the question.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:40.790
I remember, [laughs] I remember this senior-age
white farmer came to the store one day—Whitlow’s

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.770
store.

00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:44.290
He was the postmaster.

00:28:44.290 --> 00:28:46.880
The post office was housed in his store.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.452
And at lunchtime, he closed the post office
to go and eat.

00:28:51.452 --> 00:28:58.370
And I was out sweeping the stoop of the store,
and this white guy saw me, and he said, “Hey,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.430
boy!

00:28:59.430 --> 00:29:00.700
Is the post office open?”

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.540
He was asking me whether Whitlow had gone
to lunch.

00:29:04.540 --> 00:29:15.480
And I thought about it, I had to think fast,
quickly, “Now, I am a boy by age, but I’m

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.470
not the kind of boy he’s calling me.

00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:21.850
And thirdly, I’m not his boy.

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:25.880
There’s no law on the book that requires
me to respond to him.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:28.490
Now, if Whitlow called me a boy, he signs
the check.

00:29:28.490 --> 00:29:31.440
He has to pay to call me boy.

00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:32.900
I’ll answer to his ‘boy.’”

00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.290
And I didn’t say anything.

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:40.890
So, he came over to me and touched me on my
shoulder and said, “Hey, boy.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:41.900
Is the post office open?”

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:43.100
I didn’t say a thing.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:44.240
He went in the store.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:45.240
Whitlow was there.

00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.500
He says, “Whitlow, where you find that damn
deaf and dumb nigger?”

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.240
[Laughs] I laugh about that.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:58.710
He was so dumb he didn’t know that I wasn’t
deaf.

00:29:58.710 --> 00:30:09.000
I guess what I’m trying to say is I resisted
the system in my way and got by with it.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.350
And that was my [0:30:00] early beginnings
to kind of fight the system.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.350
DC: Um-hmm.

00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:17.380
And as you say, your father was the model
for that.

00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.510
HB: He was.

00:30:18.510 --> 00:30:20.020
He was the model.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:22.210
You asked me another question, and I forgot
to answer.

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.800
DC: So, what would be the next step, then,
I guess, in your journey?

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:36.220
HB: The next step was I was very attentive
to what was happening in Montgomery, Alabama.

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:47.530
As a matter of fact, maybe 1954, ’55, in
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Dr. T.J.

00:30:47.530 --> 00:30:56.570
Jemison had already staged a successful bus
boycott.

00:30:56.570 --> 00:31:06.740
Martin King knew about that and came to Baton
Rouge to model the Montgomery boycott by what

00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:08.750
had happened in Baton Rouge.

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:09.750
0010

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:16.570
Well, I watched and I read Martin King’s
book, Stride Toward Freedom, and was impressed

00:31:16.570 --> 00:31:17.570
with him.

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:25.419
It just so happened I went to a small black
church college in Marshall, Texas, Bishop

00:31:25.419 --> 00:31:31.330
College, and Martin King was my commencement
speaker.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.870
The local civil rights leader here that I
call, we call, the father of the Civil Rights

00:31:36.870 --> 00:31:40.100
Movement, Dr. C.O.

00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:46.830
Simpkins, was on Martin King’s board of
directors, and he asked Martin to interview

00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:55.710
me when I graduated and hire me to work in
the Louisiana southernmost area.

00:31:55.710 --> 00:32:03.300
And in February of 1960, Martin invited me,
Dr. King invited me to Atlanta to interview

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:06.330
me, and hired me on his staff.

00:32:06.330 --> 00:32:08.950
That was my first connection with him.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.090
DC: Um-hmm.

00:32:10.090 --> 00:32:11.590
So, that was February 1960?

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:12.590
HB: February of 1960.

00:32:12.590 --> 00:32:16.040
I started to work here in Shreveport on March
1st.

00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:21.220
I was arrested the first time March 1st.
DC: The first day?

00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:22.970
HB: First day!

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:24.720
[Laughs] First day.

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.480
And it’s interesting.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.430
I had taken a member downtown.

00:32:28.430 --> 00:32:33.600
They had a medical arts building where doctors’
offices were.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.380
And I was sitting in my car, waiting on them
to come.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:44.530
And a policeman on a motorcycle came up and
said, “Boy, you know where the jailhouse

00:32:44.530 --> 00:32:45.530
is?”

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.530
“No, sir.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:47.530
I’ve never been in jail.

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:48.870
Why would I know?”

00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:52.350
He summons three, two other policemen.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:55.120
They escorted me to the jail.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.580
Asked, “Where’s the chief?”

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.549
“He’s gone to lunch.”

00:32:59.549 --> 00:33:01.419
“Well, what should we do with him?”

00:33:01.419 --> 00:33:04.270
“Take him up,” and I guess they call it
booking.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:10.190
They handcuffed me, I mean, fingerprinted
me and took my mug and all that good stuff.

00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:13.020
And finally, the chief came.

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.030
They put me on the elevator with the chief.

00:33:15.030 --> 00:33:21.010
And the chief took me to his office and said,
“You have a bright future in Shreveport.

00:33:21.010 --> 00:33:24.940
You just graduated from Bishop College, and
you’re a young minister.

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:27.760
You’ve got a rural church up there.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:35.570
And I want to advise you not to ruin your
future by fooling with that damn communist,

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:36.570
Martin King.”

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:45.530
And he gave me this advice, and finally he
said, “Now, what are you going to do?”

00:33:45.530 --> 00:33:49.940
And I said, “Well, Chief, as soon as you
release me, I’m going back and going to

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:50.940
work.”

00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:53.679
And he said, “Okay, lock him up!”

00:33:53.679 --> 00:33:56.130
Said, “What shall we charge him with?”

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:57.130
“Oh, hell!

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:59.280
Charge him with careless and reckless.”

00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:06.990
So, my first offense was careless and reckless
driving, and neither police officer had seen

00:34:06.990 --> 00:34:08.080
me drive.

00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.089
DC: You were sitting in a parked vehicle.

00:34:11.089 --> 00:34:12.089
0011

00:34:12.089 --> 00:34:17.169
HB: In a parked vehicle, and had been sitting
there for 30 or more minutes before he came

00:34:17.169 --> 00:34:18.169
along.

00:34:18.169 --> 00:34:20.780
I was arrested I don’t know how many times.

00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:25.539
I didn’t see that as something to be glamorous
with.

00:34:25.539 --> 00:34:27.509
I’m one of four children.

00:34:27.509 --> 00:34:32.690
My daddy never went to jail, and none of my
siblings went to jail, and there I am, breaking

00:34:32.690 --> 00:34:33.690
that record.

00:34:33.690 --> 00:34:38.019
So, I didn’t keep up with it.

00:34:38.019 --> 00:34:45.889
The other most memorable arrest was the last
time Dr. King was in Shreveport.

00:34:45.889 --> 00:34:55.029
His executive director, Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker,
and I, we had this service where King was

00:34:55.029 --> 00:34:56.029
preaching.

00:34:56.029 --> 00:35:04.200
The Ku Klux Klan protested the service, so
they were marching in front of the church.

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.019
And we went out.

00:35:06.019 --> 00:35:13.599
And the young NAACP Youth group [0:35:00]
were counter-protesting the Ku Klux Klan.

00:35:13.599 --> 00:35:17.390
So, Dr. Walker and I went out to see what
was happening.

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:21.950
And the chief told us, “Go back into the
church!”

00:35:21.950 --> 00:35:28.170
And Dr. Walker said, “America is free.

00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:30.019
We can stand wherever we choose to stand.”

00:35:30.019 --> 00:35:39.089
And, of course, I’m southern-born, southern-bred,
and don’t know that I would have said that.

00:35:39.089 --> 00:35:40.799
And I made an attempt to go back.

00:35:40.799 --> 00:35:44.720
And he said, “Stay here, Harry Blake, with
me.”

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:50.160
And they arrested us, put us in jail for “mental
observation.”

00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:55.529
Well, we stayed there, I think, 36 hours.

00:35:55.529 --> 00:36:00.680
And many years afterward, Dr. Walker invited
me to his church in Harlem, and he introduced

00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:03.099
me, “This is my friend, Harry Blake.

00:36:03.099 --> 00:36:08.210
When I was in Shreveport, we got arrested
for ‘mental observation,’ a charge for

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.339
which he has not been cleared yet!”

00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:15.240
[Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] So, why do you think they, I

00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.240
mean, brought that?

00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:17.240
What a bizarre charge!

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:18.240
Right?

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240
So, why do you think they did that?

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.849
HB: Well, they couldn’t get anything else.

00:36:20.849 --> 00:36:22.550
And that way they could hold us.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:26.640
See, that was all about intimidation.

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:34.589
That was also all about seeing if they could
dig in your background and find something,

00:36:34.589 --> 00:36:43.769
or could they create stuff to get—and so,
the best thing they could create on me was

00:36:43.769 --> 00:36:51.589
that I was affiliated with the communists,
Martin King and Dr. C.O.

00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:54.049
Simpkins, who was here in Shreveport.

00:36:54.049 --> 00:36:59.881
We were getting our orders and instructions
from Moscow, because we—as Negroes, you

00:36:59.881 --> 00:37:07.430
were too dumb to think, had to have somebody
to think for you.

00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:11.049
I came on the staff March 1st 1960.

00:37:11.049 --> 00:37:17.490
October 12th, there was an assassination attempt
on my life.

00:37:17.490 --> 00:37:25.980
I was driving from my rural church on a two-lane
highway, and a car behind me, I thought, was

00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:32.279
pulling into the left lane to pass.

00:37:32.279 --> 00:37:35.259
And I heard this noise.

00:37:35.259 --> 00:37:41.739
I thought he had thrown a rock, but they had
shot in my car.

00:37:41.739 --> 00:37:47.789
And at the split-second the bullet came, I
leant forward to adjust my radio, and the

00:37:47.789 --> 00:37:54.180
impact of the glass from the bullet tore four
holes in the coat I was wearing.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:38:02.210
I pursued the car so I could get the tag number
and report it to the sheriff.

00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:07.489
Reported it to the sheriff, and the sheriff
said some days subsequent to that that the

00:38:07.489 --> 00:38:13.319
owner of the car said he was bowling at that
time, so he couldn’t have shot at me.

00:38:13.319 --> 00:38:15.299
And that’s all that was done.

00:38:15.299 --> 00:38:19.030
DC: And that’s how justice worked?

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.030
0012

00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:22.650
HB: That’s how justice worked.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:28.930
I don’t know if I—
DC: Well, let me ask another question, because

00:38:28.930 --> 00:38:35.460
you said that Dr. Wyatt Tee Walker—what
he said when you were standing out there maybe

00:38:35.460 --> 00:38:38.230
wasn’t quite what you would have said.

00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:45.489
And I just sort of want to ask about, you
know, there’s the South and there’s how

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:47.890
whites treated blacks in the South, far from
universal.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:52.619
So, did—the question I want to ask is did
SCLC sort of—really knew what they were

00:38:52.619 --> 00:38:53.619
getting into—?

00:38:53.619 --> 00:38:55.930
HB: Oh, yes!
DC: In this part of southwest Louisiana?

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.299
HB: Oh, yes!

00:38:57.299 --> 00:38:58.299
Yes, yes.

00:38:58.299 --> 00:39:07.119
I’m assuming they did, because Alabama was
equally as bad, Mississippi.

00:39:07.119 --> 00:39:14.950
However, the Civil Rights Commission said
in their report that Shreveport was the most

00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:18.430
difficult city in the South.

00:39:18.430 --> 00:39:30.069
We didn’t have the Emmett Till, Medgar Evers,
but we had what we had to keep Negroes under

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:31.069
control.

00:39:31.069 --> 00:39:42.049
Because Shreveport was basically a plantation
environment, so those of us on the plantation

00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:47.039
were disciplined mentally to kind of be obedient.

00:39:47.039 --> 00:39:53.960
So, when he said to me to go back in the church,
I had seen what I needed to see, so I would

00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:55.250
have gone back.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:00.660
But Dr. Walker, from a different situation,
resisted.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:07.780
So, I stood with him, and we both got locked
up in jail.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.960
DC: Um-hmm.

00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:15.730
Now, did you [0:40:00] find support or any
reluctance for support from your parents or

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.299
from your church when you got involved?

00:40:17.299 --> 00:40:19.279
HB: Well, here’s what I did.

00:40:19.279 --> 00:40:24.880
I went to my parents when I decided to accept
Dr. King’s invitation.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:32.750
I went and said to my dad and mom, “The
job that I’m going to take may result in

00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:37.190
my death or injury.

00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:44.979
But not only that, it may result in your injury
or death, because I’m your child.

00:40:44.979 --> 00:40:48.619
I want to apologize for putting you in that
position.

00:40:48.619 --> 00:40:54.279
But you raised me and made me the kind of
person that I am.”

00:40:54.279 --> 00:41:00.710
And my daddy said, “I’d be disappointed
if you did anything different.”

00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:08.589
And my siblings—my siblings are younger
than I—they tell me now the kind of treatment

00:41:08.589 --> 00:41:11.819
that my daddy got.

00:41:11.819 --> 00:41:17.950
If the policeman saw him anywhere, he stopped
him and called him dumb, “you stupid-ass

00:41:17.950 --> 00:41:19.989
nigger,” and what-have-you.

00:41:19.989 --> 00:41:23.369
And my daddy never responded.

00:41:23.369 --> 00:41:28.599
When they got through with him, he got back
in his car and went on.

00:41:28.599 --> 00:41:35.089
So, he went through great humiliation because
of me that he never shared with me.

00:41:35.089 --> 00:41:39.719
My siblings, after my daddy’s death, shared
that with me.

00:41:39.719 --> 00:41:47.029
DC: Now, did you ever have the chance to talk
with them and celebrate at all about some

00:41:47.029 --> 00:41:48.170
gains that were made?

00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:49.170
0013

00:41:49.170 --> 00:41:53.099
HB: I don’t know if this answers your question.

00:41:53.099 --> 00:42:03.619
When I helped my daddy to pass the voter test,
that was the celebration, that he got a chance

00:42:03.619 --> 00:42:07.940
to vote in his lifetime.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:11.849
One thing that haunts me that I never did.

00:42:11.849 --> 00:42:18.170
It pains me so that I struggle to restrain
my tears.

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:25.739
I never taught my daddy to write his name,
and I could have done that.

00:42:25.739 --> 00:42:33.910
But he was a man of morals and courage.

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:35.970
DC: Um-hmm.

00:42:35.970 --> 00:42:40.249
And jumping ahead again, I understand that
you did run into some, quite some violence

00:42:40.249 --> 00:42:43.279
yourself as part of the Movement.

00:42:43.279 --> 00:42:44.279
HB: Yeah.

00:42:44.279 --> 00:42:46.049
DC: If you wouldn’t mind talking about that.

00:42:46.049 --> 00:42:55.099
HB: The girls who were killed in Sixteenth
Street Baptist Church, September fifteenth,

00:42:55.099 --> 00:42:58.380
1963.

00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:06.329
President Kennedy declared the next Sunday
a day of mourning.

00:43:06.329 --> 00:43:15.880
The civil rights leaders suggested that we
would have memorial services in our communities

00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:17.739
that Sunday, September twenty-second.

00:43:17.739 --> 00:43:33.519
I went to—our form of government then was
a commissioner form of government.

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:40.680
I went to the Commissioner of Public Safety
to get a permit to have a march from Booker

00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:46.660
Washington High School to the closest church,
Little Union.

00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:49.190
I think I went to the commissioner that Tuesday.

00:43:49.190 --> 00:43:51.979
He said, “I’ll get back with you.”

00:43:51.979 --> 00:43:57.930
Saturday noon, he summons me to his office
and said, “Permit denied.”

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:02.039
Well, the next day, the service was going
to be held, and the march.

00:44:02.039 --> 00:44:06.930
Then, he asked me, “Well, what are you going
to do?”

00:44:06.930 --> 00:44:11.960
I said, “Well, Commissioner, you had five
or six days to make your decision, and you

00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:14.380
want me to make mine in five or six minutes.

00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:17.549
You will see Sunday what I’m going to do.”

00:44:17.549 --> 00:44:24.740
He said, “Well, let me tell you, anybody
in Shreveport participates in a march, I will

00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.900
arrest every person participating.”

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.890
“Commissioner, you do what you have to do.”

00:44:31.890 --> 00:44:35.009
I knew he meant that.

00:44:35.009 --> 00:44:44.450
I didn’t want, if I can use this expression,
innocent people participating in the march,

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:47.640
getting arrested, losing their jobs.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:51.479
So, here’s what we did, low-key.

00:44:51.479 --> 00:44:57.609
We got the word out, “Meet at the site where
the march was to begin.”

00:44:57.609 --> 00:44:58.609
And they did.

00:44:58.609 --> 00:45:00.390
We told them, “Just go on to the church.

00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:01.450
We’ve canceled the march.”

00:45:01.450 --> 00:45:07.880
But by that time, the commissioner was prepared.

00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:17.980
And there were policemen, [0:45:00] law enforcement
people, all over this community, looked like

00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.720
by the thousands.

00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:27.099
They were on horses, with bayonets, and had
garbage trucks to haul the people that they

00:45:27.099 --> 00:45:29.829
were going to arrest.

00:45:29.829 --> 00:45:38.089
And it looked like there were literally thousands
of black folk who showed up for the march.

00:45:38.089 --> 00:45:41.559
But they didn’t show up for the march.

00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:47.450
They were amazed at what was happening, so
they came out of their houses on the streets,

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:48.450
looking.

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:54.100
And you may have scenes from that; if you
don’t, we’ll share them with you so you

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.440
can see them.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.470
0014

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:04.630
But at the close of the service, a lawyer,
Dr. Turney Stone, went to the commissioner

00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:08.670
and said, “Now, Commissioner, we need to
get out of the church.”

00:46:08.670 --> 00:46:15.269
He said, “Well, the only way you can get
out, you come out two by two.”

00:46:15.269 --> 00:46:26.219
Well, at that time, the white citizens group,
the Ku Klux Klan were outside marching and

00:46:26.219 --> 00:46:27.640
protesting.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:32.190
I went out of the vestibule to see what was
going on.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:34.319
The service was over now.

00:46:34.319 --> 00:46:41.109
And I met the commissioner and two other policemen
in the vestibule.

00:46:41.109 --> 00:46:46.440
And they manhandled me and began to beat me
inside the vestibule of the church, drug me

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:51.920
on the outside, and every policeman who could
get close enough to get a piece of my head

00:46:51.920 --> 00:46:57.210
with his nightstick beat me until they thought
I was dead or appeared to be lifeless, and

00:46:57.210 --> 00:47:04.650
they left me laying on the lawn on the sidewalk.

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:11.269
That was September twenty-second, 1963.

00:47:11.269 --> 00:47:20.920
And my wife was fearful, my family was fearful
of me getting medical attention from the white

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.180
doctors.

00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:27.640
Flew me to Dallas.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:34.559
And the young people at the high school decided
something needed to be done, and they began

00:47:34.559 --> 00:47:36.020
protest movement.

00:47:36.020 --> 00:47:47.299
And that’s where the police beat them, teargas-bombed
them, went to the school, manhandled the principal,

00:47:47.299 --> 00:47:53.109
hit and arrested a white teacher.

00:47:53.109 --> 00:48:01.039
And Shreveport went into the greatest movement,
I guess you could say, protest movement, that

00:48:01.039 --> 00:48:04.469
it had experienced during that week.

00:48:04.469 --> 00:48:09.150
And, of course, two weeks ago, we just finished
the celebration of the 50 years.

00:48:09.150 --> 00:48:10.400
DC: Fifty years of that movement?

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.030
HB: Um-hmm.
DC: Yeah, yeah.

00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:16.079
I mean, that sounds like outright war, at
that point.

00:48:16.079 --> 00:48:20.099
HB: If you don’t have access to the pictures,
we’ll let you see them.

00:48:20.099 --> 00:48:22.049
It looked like a war zone.

00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:23.049
DC: Um-hmm.

00:48:23.049 --> 00:48:27.089
So, how did that play out, then, in the coming
months?

00:48:27.089 --> 00:48:28.250
And what about your own recovery?

00:48:28.250 --> 00:48:30.490
I imagine that took some time.

00:48:30.490 --> 00:48:36.880
HB: Well, the president of my school that
was in Marshall had moved to Dallas, Texas,

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.719
Bishop College.

00:48:38.719 --> 00:48:46.969
And that president of the school put me in
faculty housing until I recovered and came

00:48:46.969 --> 00:48:55.529
back to Shreveport, with my wife and two children
at that time.

00:48:55.529 --> 00:49:01.599
Um—
DC: So, yeah, if you could just tell us about

00:49:01.599 --> 00:49:09.859
how the Movement then went on, starting with
such a violent beginning.

00:49:09.859 --> 00:49:10.859
0015

00:49:10.859 --> 00:49:16.720
HB: Well, here’s the way I interpret it.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:24.279
Remember I’m saying it was students.

00:49:24.279 --> 00:49:35.749
Parents knew that Commissioner D’Artois
was a violent man, and he had full control

00:49:35.749 --> 00:49:39.069
of Shreveport.

00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:40.660
He was the power.

00:49:40.660 --> 00:49:44.319
Even white folks feared him.

00:49:44.319 --> 00:49:54.150
And black parents didn’t want their children
killed or hurt, so they found a way to kind

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:59.299
of quell that within a week or two.

00:49:59.299 --> 00:50:04.459
And one way, one thing they did, they arrested
students.

00:50:04.459 --> 00:50:10.369
There’s a guy in this city who was a student.

00:50:10.369 --> 00:50:18.020
[0:50:00] The Commissioner decided—he has
to make somebody the leader as an example—decided

00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:19.959
he was the leader.

00:50:19.959 --> 00:50:22.560
They put him in jail.

00:50:22.560 --> 00:50:33.130
And I believe he tells it he stayed in jail
either 32 or 42 days.

00:50:33.130 --> 00:50:40.769
He could not go to a school, public school,
in the city.

00:50:40.769 --> 00:50:42.880
I think he moved to New Orleans.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:52.559
But, at any rate, 50 years later, they did
grant him a high school diploma, but he had

00:50:52.559 --> 00:50:59.130
finished school somewhere else and college.

00:50:59.130 --> 00:51:04.190
As a matter of fact, 40 years subsequent to
the day that I was beaten, the city did—and

00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:14.059
I’ll show it to you on the wall—a public
proclamation of apology for what had happened

00:51:14.059 --> 00:51:16.180
to me.

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:23.099
JB: [Coughs]
DC: Do you want to pause for a second?

00:51:23.099 --> 00:51:26.489
[Recording stops and then resumes]
JB: Okay, we’re back.

00:51:26.489 --> 00:51:30.630
DC: So, where did the Movement locally then
go from there?

00:51:30.630 --> 00:51:36.819
What change did you want to see, did you demand
in Shreveport?

00:51:36.819 --> 00:51:42.739
HB: I think what really happened, [clears
throat] I think in the inner recesses of my

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:43.739
soul, I had to analyze that—and I understood
why, though—not one single adult in this

00:51:43.739 --> 00:51:44.739
city made a public protest of what happened
to me.

00:51:44.739 --> 00:51:45.739
[Pause] So, as I reasoned that, to keep from
getting resentful and bitter, I rationalized.

00:51:45.739 --> 00:51:46.739
Not one adult called a meeting and said, “Harry
Blake, we want you to be our civil rights

00:51:46.739 --> 00:51:47.739
leader.”

00:51:47.739 --> 00:51:48.739
So, I voluntarily put myself in harm’s way.

00:51:48.739 --> 00:51:49.739
And the commissioner was—he didn’t play.

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:50.739
Here’s what he did.

00:51:50.739 --> 00:51:51.739
If we had a rally, he would send somebody
in, wired to tape it, and any black person

00:51:51.739 --> 00:51:52.739
who spoke, it was recorded.

00:51:52.739 --> 00:51:53.739
For instance, if they worked in a company
or for the school board, they were sent to

00:51:53.739 --> 00:51:54.739
the superintendent, and the superintendent
was directed to fire them.

00:51:54.739 --> 00:51:55.739
He went for the jugular.

00:51:55.739 --> 00:51:56.739
0016

00:51:56.739 --> 00:51:57.739
So, I decided I can, after that, I can still
fight for freedom in a different way, because

00:51:57.739 --> 00:51:58.739
protests were kind of dying out at that time,
in 1963.

00:51:58.739 --> 00:51:59.739
And I tested myself.

00:51:59.739 --> 00:52:00.739
I went, [laughs] I went to the school board
to apply for a teacher’s job.

00:52:00.739 --> 00:52:01.739
And white folk in the South are smart: “Give
him a job, and he can’t work for us and

00:52:01.739 --> 00:52:02.739
do all this stuff that he’s doing in the
Civil Rights Movement.”

00:52:02.739 --> 00:52:03.739
And I worked a couple of years.

00:52:03.739 --> 00:52:04.739
I told them I would not sign a contract, because
I didn’t want to be inhibited with my work

00:52:04.739 --> 00:52:05.739
here.

00:52:05.739 --> 00:52:06.739
So, I got called to this church in ’66.

00:52:06.739 --> 00:52:07.739
I went to the commissioner and said to him,
“Mr. Commissioner, I’m a new pastor in

00:52:07.739 --> 00:52:08.739
Shreveport.

00:52:08.739 --> 00:52:09.739
I know what you did to me at Little Union.”

00:52:09.739 --> 00:52:10.739
He said, “Let me stop you.

00:52:10.739 --> 00:52:11.739
I didn’t do anything to you.

00:52:11.739 --> 00:52:12.739
I didn’t touch you.”

00:52:12.739 --> 00:52:13.739
I said, “Well, we’re not going to argue
about that, Commissioner.

00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:14.739
I want you to do me a favor.

00:52:14.739 --> 00:52:15.739
I am a new pastor.

00:52:15.739 --> 00:52:16.739
There are things I want to get done in the
Allendale community.

00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:17.739
I’d like to have your support.

00:52:17.739 --> 00:52:18.739
But before you pledge your support, I want
you to know anything I’ve done in the past,

00:52:18.739 --> 00:52:19.739
should I deem it necessary to repeat, I will.”

00:52:19.739 --> 00:52:21.260
He said, “Well, you know, Reverend Blake,
I haven’t always agreed with your methods,

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:23.339
but I’ve always had respect for you.

00:52:23.339 --> 00:52:25.969
What can I do for you?”

00:52:25.969 --> 00:52:29.819
And I went to the mayor and said the same
thing to the mayor.

00:52:29.819 --> 00:52:34.339
And the mayor said to me, [0:55:00] “Reverend
Blake, I’m a politician.

00:52:34.339 --> 00:52:40.240
Do you remember each time you were arrested
what judge you went before?”

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:42.430
I said, “Judge Whitmire.”

00:52:42.430 --> 00:52:45.660
He said, “That was by design.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:52.999
I told them and told the judge what he couldn’t
do to you.

00:52:52.999 --> 00:52:54.859
I’m a politician.

00:52:54.859 --> 00:52:55.859
I couldn’t come out.

00:52:55.859 --> 00:53:03.029
I know the Movement was right and just, but
I’m a politician.

00:53:03.029 --> 00:53:05.690
What can I do for you?”

00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:12.289
I said, “Mr. Mayor, anything I’ve done
in the future, should I deem it necessary

00:53:12.289 --> 00:53:13.289
to repeat—.”

00:53:13.289 --> 00:53:14.490
He said, “I understand that.

00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.999
What can I do for you?”

00:53:16.999 --> 00:53:24.559
And I showed him the condition of my church,
but I also showed him the condition of this

00:53:24.559 --> 00:53:25.559
community.

00:53:25.559 --> 00:53:33.493
There were outdoor operative privies, toilets,
in this community when I came in ’66.

00:53:33.493 --> 00:53:37.980
“I want to build some housing for poor people.

00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:46.289
And the city owns eight acres of land that’s
supposed to be a park, but it’s never been

00:53:46.289 --> 00:53:47.289
developed.

00:53:47.289 --> 00:53:51.269
I want you to give that to my church to build
housing.”

00:53:51.269 --> 00:53:55.569
He said, “The city can’t sell property,
but give me a little time.”

00:53:55.569 --> 00:54:01.969
He had an ordinance passed that said that
“said property shall be sold to Mount Canaan

00:54:01.969 --> 00:54:11.579
Baptist Church for $35,000, and the use of
the property is limited to housing, recreation,

00:54:11.579 --> 00:54:17.869
education, or religious purposes.”

00:54:17.869 --> 00:54:28.770
And we built, 40 years ago, a 120-unit housing
for low-income families and a daycare center.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:40.729
And then, some 30 years ago, we built a high-rise
senior citizens’ tower next to that building,

00:54:40.729 --> 00:54:42.709
a couple of blocks away.

00:54:42.709 --> 00:54:51.479
So, that’s what I started working on, helping
to improve the community and helping with

00:54:51.479 --> 00:54:53.799
education, which is my passion.

00:54:53.799 --> 00:54:54.799
DC: Um-hmm.

00:54:54.799 --> 00:54:57.640
HB: I just did it in a different way.

00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:58.640
0017

00:54:58.640 --> 00:54:59.640
DC: Um-hmm.

00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:06.170
So, if you could talk about how you see that
kind of work—housing, senior citizen care,

00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:11.890
education, childcare—being part and parcel
of the Movement.

00:55:11.890 --> 00:55:22.319
HB: It is a part of the Movement, because
people—you see, the Movement was targeted

00:55:22.319 --> 00:55:26.739
at the immoral things.

00:55:26.739 --> 00:55:37.549
It was immoral for me to pay bus fare and
have to stand in the back when there’s sitting

00:55:37.549 --> 00:55:38.640
room upfront.

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:46.349
It was immoral for me to go—they didn’t
have Burger Kings then, but similar places,

00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:50.930
and I have to go around to the window and
pick up my hamburger.

00:55:50.930 --> 00:56:03.079
It’s immoral for a bus station to have a
restroom and I can’t go to it, or a water

00:56:03.079 --> 00:56:07.890
fountain I can’t drink out of because it
says, “White Only.”

00:56:07.890 --> 00:56:13.869
That’s one of the things the Movement was
focusing on.

00:56:13.869 --> 00:56:17.040
I may be the only person in America who sees
it this way.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:25.699
I don’t think Martin King—I know I didn’t—we
were concerned about the kind of integration

00:56:25.699 --> 00:56:28.630
we got, particularly in the schools.

00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:39.650
We weren’t asking for them to integrate
the schools, necessarily, but give the black

00:56:39.650 --> 00:56:46.700
school the same funding and the same capable
teachers that you give to the white school.

00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:57.499
But the system in America is smart.

00:56:57.499 --> 00:57:06.630
They took control and gave us a kind of integration
that we weren’t looking for: bused us from

00:57:06.630 --> 00:57:12.650
our neighborhoods to the white schools and
closed black schools.

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:17.319
And still, the black schools that were left,
still had inferior curriculum.

00:57:17.319 --> 00:57:29.089
In a sense—I may [be] the only person in
America—in a sense, we got duped.

00:57:29.089 --> 00:57:38.640
Now, [1:00:00] once you open up the hotels
and the restaurants, if I don’t have a decent

00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:41.499
income, I still can’t go there.

00:57:41.499 --> 00:57:53.349
And that’s where I’ve kind of begun to
focus myself, to get stores to hire blacks

00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:55.410
in places.

00:57:55.410 --> 00:57:57.410
I like to tell this.

00:57:57.410 --> 00:58:00.650
I was a cashier in the Whitlow store in the
’50s.

00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:03.319
I didn’t go in the cigar box to make change.

00:58:03.319 --> 00:58:05.749
I went in the cash register.

00:58:05.749 --> 00:58:11.780
I was a cashier in the country ten or fifteen
years before we got a black cashier in the

00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:12.780
city.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.990
So, that’s why I keep going back to Whitlow.

00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:22.999
He helped me do stuff that even the city of
Shreveport was not doing.

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:30.279
DC: So, how are your relations now with some
of these people that [laughs] you went through

00:58:30.279 --> 00:58:32.019
all of this against or with?

00:58:32.019 --> 00:58:39.259
HB: Well, obviously, the Whitlow guy, because
he was 60-odd years old in the ’50s, he’s

00:58:39.259 --> 00:58:40.779
gone to heaven.

00:58:40.779 --> 00:58:43.240
I have a good relationship with whites.

00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:47.609
I have a good relationship.

00:58:47.609 --> 00:58:57.890
I’m not—I have no interest in, let’s
see how I can say this.

00:58:57.890 --> 00:59:02.979
I won’t say I don’t have an interest in
politics.

00:59:02.979 --> 00:59:08.339
I have no interest in being a politician,
holding a position, don’t want that at all.

00:59:08.339 --> 00:59:12.650
But I do want to determine who gets the position.

00:59:12.650 --> 00:59:18.839
I would never want to be a mayor, because
if you’re a mayor, you’re a one- or two-term

00:59:18.839 --> 00:59:19.839
mayor.

00:59:19.839 --> 00:59:21.759
But if you make mayors, you’re a mayor every
time you make one.

00:59:21.759 --> 00:59:23.029
That’s my position.

00:59:23.029 --> 00:59:24.029
DC: Um-hmm.

00:59:24.029 --> 00:59:26.839
HB: I guess I answered your question.

00:59:26.839 --> 00:59:27.839
0018

00:59:27.839 --> 00:59:28.839
DC: Yes.

00:59:28.839 --> 00:59:32.940
So, I mean, that does lead me to another one,
which is: so, where is the source—where

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.859
has been the source of black power in Shreveport,
then?

00:59:34.859 --> 00:59:38.150
Is it in the churches, or is it elsewhere?

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:44.109
And another way of asking that is: who have
been your allies as you’ve worked on these

00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:45.109
issues?

00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:52.920
HB: Uh, [laughs] I think if you ask other
citizens, you’ll get different responses.

00:59:52.920 --> 01:00:07.609
But, as I see it, the power has been in the
black church and still is, because every Sunday

01:00:07.609 --> 01:00:18.930
morning you’ve got a captive audience and
you can kind of mold and make in your area,

01:00:18.930 --> 01:00:23.739
your church, your community, what you want
to see happen.

01:00:23.739 --> 01:00:26.789
DC: You can salt the diet, as you say.

01:00:26.789 --> 01:00:27.880
[Laughs]
HB: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:28.880
Exactly, exactly.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:32.469
Put a little salt in the diet, yes, yes.

01:00:32.469 --> 01:00:33.509
DC: Yeah.

01:00:33.509 --> 01:00:41.589
HB: When Martin King first came to Shreveport,
during those years, blacks were fearful of

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:42.589
his presence.

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:53.999
It was only after he died that everybody,
for the most part, saw him as the prophet.

01:00:53.999 --> 01:01:02.760
There were several churches who voted that
he could not preach.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:09.799
As a matter of fact, this church was vacant
in the height of the Civil Rights Movement,

01:01:09.799 --> 01:01:11.239
during ’61.

01:01:11.239 --> 01:01:20.220
My name came up as a candidate, and they voted,
“Harry Blake is a good man.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.410
He’s a good leader.

01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:25.259
But he may get our church bombed or burned.”

01:01:25.259 --> 01:01:29.599
And they didn’t realize that would have
been a blessing, with the condition that church

01:01:29.599 --> 01:01:31.279
building was in.

01:01:31.279 --> 01:01:36.599
[Laughs] It was only after the Civil Rights
Movement had taken a different direction that

01:01:36.599 --> 01:01:39.349
they considered and called me.

01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:42.729
DC: Very interesting.

01:01:42.729 --> 01:01:45.730
Well, let’s—this has been wonderful.

01:01:45.730 --> 01:01:47.910
And, I guess, let’s start to wrap up.

01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:51.859
But if I may ask: so, what are you focusing
on now?

01:01:51.859 --> 01:01:55.099
HB: Focusing on going home and sitting down.

01:01:55.099 --> 01:01:56.210
[Laughs]
DC: [Laughs]

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.839
HB: I’ll be 80 years old next year!

01:01:58.839 --> 01:01:59.869
DC: You would not.

01:01:59.869 --> 01:02:00.869
Yeah.

01:02:00.869 --> 01:02:01.869
0019

01:02:01.869 --> 01:02:10.989
HB: My focus now is: all over America, and
it cannot be denied that the school system

01:02:10.989 --> 01:02:15.959
needs help, in trouble.

01:02:15.959 --> 01:02:30.719
And unfortunately for me, I’ve always tackled
what appeared to be the impossible.

01:02:30.719 --> 01:02:39.009
When I read statistics [1:05:00] that the
system decides by the time a black boy becomes

01:02:39.009 --> 01:02:50.109
fourth grade, depending on how he’s performing,
they determine how many prison cells to build.

01:02:50.109 --> 01:02:59.729
By fourth grade students!

01:02:59.729 --> 01:03:04.259
Black males in America are in trouble.

01:03:04.259 --> 01:03:21.319
So, it is incumbent upon me to have a ministry
in my church to develop strong moral black

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.319
men.

01:03:22.319 --> 01:03:24.589
That’s where I’m going.

01:03:24.589 --> 01:03:27.650
What do you do with the third and fourth grade
boys?

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:36.390
You teach them how to read.

01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:40.949
Do you start a school and compete with the
public schools?

01:03:40.949 --> 01:03:43.450
I’m not sure that I want to do that.

01:03:43.450 --> 01:03:48.839
So, three summers ago, I started a summer
boys’ academy.

01:03:48.839 --> 01:03:54.029
I remember—I think we’ve had up to 50
in that.

01:03:54.029 --> 01:03:58.140
One boy was on second grade reading level.

01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.529
And when we got through with him, he was on
sixth grade reading level.

01:04:02.529 --> 01:04:07.270
So, I know it can be done.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:16.559
There’s a boy in this church named Walter,
12 years old, and I kept hearing that he can’t

01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:20.599
read, he can’t pass the fourth grade material.

01:04:20.599 --> 01:04:26.420
I said to my church, “We’ve got to help
Walter.”

01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:31.400
And I perhaps shouldn’t have said this,
but I said, “If this was a white church,

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:33.569
we’d find a way to help Walter.”

01:04:33.569 --> 01:04:39.940
And this church, this church, this church
is so kind to me.

01:04:39.940 --> 01:04:45.710
They allow me to try anything that’s going
to help people and they underwrite it.

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:50.479
I said, out of my frustration, “Let’s
homeschool him!”

01:04:50.479 --> 01:04:57.039
And somebody in the background said, “Homeschool
him in your house, not mine!”

01:04:57.039 --> 01:05:02.939
[Laughs and claps]
So, that caught on!

01:05:02.939 --> 01:05:06.329
And I did some investigation.

01:05:06.329 --> 01:05:08.359
There’s virtual schools.

01:05:08.359 --> 01:05:12.640
That’s a term that I didn’t even know
about.

01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:19.809
And finally, there’s a young woman in this
church sympathized with my passion, said,

01:05:19.809 --> 01:05:25.490
“Pastor, I’ve been teaching in the system,
Bossier, the other parish,” I think she

01:05:25.490 --> 01:05:27.589
said for 33 or 35 years.

01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:31.029
“I hadn’t planned to retire this year,
but I will retire.”

01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:34.509
And that was in July.

01:05:34.509 --> 01:05:41.670
“I will turn my papers in next week to come
over here and help you with that school.”

01:05:41.670 --> 01:05:45.910
And I’d like for you to see her before you
leave, just meet her.

01:05:45.910 --> 01:05:46.910
She’s here.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:54.410
And we have five boys in that school, and
we’ll take some more next year.

01:05:54.410 --> 01:05:55.599
DC: And they come every day?

01:05:55.599 --> 01:05:59.259
HB: Every day, from eight to three.

01:05:59.259 --> 01:06:04.160
DC: So, you are homeschooling them in the
church?

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.789
HB: Homeschooling them in the church!

01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:07.160
And the church allows me to do that.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.269
That’s what’s so great about Mount Canaan
Church.

01:06:10.269 --> 01:06:15.059
They allow me to do silly, not silly, crazy
stuff.

01:06:15.059 --> 01:06:16.279
And I generally make it work.

01:06:16.279 --> 01:06:18.670
We generally make it work.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:26.250
DC: That’s interesting that, even in the
Movement, which was a mass movement, it was

01:06:26.250 --> 01:06:28.339
about one-on-one change and interaction.

01:06:28.339 --> 01:06:29.339
0020

01:06:29.339 --> 01:06:30.339
HB: You got it.

01:06:30.339 --> 01:06:34.160
DC: And here’s an example of intervention
at a personal level.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:36.119
HB: Sure.

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:37.119
You got it.

01:06:37.119 --> 01:06:39.160
DC: Well, anything that we didn’t cover
that you want to add?

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.170
I’m sure there’s a lot.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.380
HB: Oh, I didn’t even want to do this!

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:45.309
[Laughs]
DC: [Laughs] Well, I’m so glad you did!

01:06:45.309 --> 01:06:46.309
I mean, really.

01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:48.309
HB: Ah, you better thank my secretary.

01:06:48.309 --> 01:06:49.719
“Daddy, you got to do this!”

01:06:49.719 --> 01:06:50.719
“For what?”

01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:51.719
“For posterity!”

01:06:51.719 --> 01:06:57.339
“I won’t be here for posterity.”

01:06:57.339 --> 01:07:06.009
I really wish I could think of something else
that I need to say, other than Mount Canaan

01:07:06.009 --> 01:07:17.119
Church is right in the center of the hood,
but making a difference in the hood, and they

01:07:17.119 --> 01:07:21.700
give me full range to bring about change.

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.390
DC: Um-hmm.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:29.609
HB: The best thing to happen to me was this
church in the hood!

01:07:29.609 --> 01:07:31.240
DC: Wonderful.

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.480
John, do you have anything [1:10:00] you wanted
to ask?

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.910
JB: No, I think you—every question I had
on the tip of my tongue, you’ve already

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:40.910
answered.

01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:41.910
DC: Fantastic.

01:07:41.910 --> 01:07:42.910
Well, thank you so much.

01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:43.910
We’re—I can’t even express how much
we appreciate this.

01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:45.819
HB: I do want you just to see this teacher.

01:07:45.819 --> 01:07:46.819
DC: Absolutely!

01:07:46.819 --> 01:07:47.819
Absolutely!

01:07:47.819 --> 01:07:48.819
HB: Okay.

01:07:48.819 --> 01:07:53.640
DC: And I know some of the pictures that you
were talking about, too, if we could look

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.640
at them.
