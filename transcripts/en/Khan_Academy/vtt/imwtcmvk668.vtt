00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:01.331
- [Voiceover] Hello grammarians.

00:00:01.331 --> 00:00:04.048
Alright, today I want to start
talking about conjunctions,

00:00:04.048 --> 00:00:06.870
and conjunctions are
this part of speech that

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.958
has a very particular function
in English and what it does

00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:13.801
conjunctions unite words,
phrases, and clauses.

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.681
Let me, let me show you an example.

00:00:15.681 --> 00:00:17.121
So if you want to talk about two things,

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:21.545
you could say it's a
peanut butter and jelly.

00:00:21.545 --> 00:00:24.087
Or if I were going to
paraphrase Eddie Izzard,

00:00:24.087 --> 00:00:27.920
I might offer you the
choice of cake or death.

00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:31.866
You could also describe
something as being sad but true.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:34.327
And these three are the most
commonly used conjunctions

00:00:34.327 --> 00:00:36.672
because I would be remiss
if I didn't mention the

00:00:36.672 --> 00:00:40.411
seminal conjunction song that got me into

00:00:40.411 --> 00:00:43.004
the grammar game in the first
place, Conjunction Junction,

00:00:43.004 --> 00:00:45.241
which I think was written by Jack Sheldon

00:00:45.241 --> 00:00:48.434
or performed by Jack
Sheldon in like, 1973.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:51.069
Schoolhouse Rock. It's great. Look it up.

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:53.148
But what I'm going to talk about today

00:00:53.148 --> 00:00:57.640
is a mnemonic, or a memory
aide, called FANBOYS.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.624
You may have heard this before, FANBOYS.

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:03.585
And this is how we remember
the coordinating conjunctions.

00:01:03.585 --> 00:01:05.001
And you don't need to worry about the name

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.962
coordinating conjunctions,
we'll get to that later.

00:01:07.962 --> 00:01:10.545
For now, just remember FANBOYS.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.070
For, And, Nor, But, Or,
Yet, and So. FANBOYS.

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:24.691
We'll go through how each
one of these are used

00:01:24.691 --> 00:01:28.274
over the next screen.
Follow me downstairs!

00:01:31.472 --> 00:01:35.555
So we've got For, And,
Nor, But, Or, Yet, and So,

00:01:36.638 --> 00:01:39.517
and each of them have a
different basic function.

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:41.201
So let's, let's review them.

00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:43.813
For has this connotation.

00:01:43.813 --> 00:01:45.461
You can use it the way you'd use a word

00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:48.044
like since or because, as in...

00:01:49.688 --> 00:01:52.752
I do not eat buttons,
for they are not food.

00:01:52.752 --> 00:01:56.476
You can see I'm combining
these two little sentences

00:01:56.476 --> 00:01:58.059
using the word for.

00:01:58.894 --> 00:02:02.679
We're using this for to
explain my reasoning.

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:05.245
I do not eat buttons
because they are not food,

00:02:05.245 --> 00:02:08.662
and for is a simpler way to express that.

00:02:10.233 --> 00:02:14.133
The conjunction and? Very
elemental, very important

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:18.881
conjunction combines one
thing with another as in...

00:02:18.881 --> 00:02:22.323
The kangaroo robbed the
bank and torched the saloon.

00:02:22.323 --> 00:02:24.157
A rather criminal kangaroo.

00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:27.675
And you can see we're using
and to combine these two ideas.

00:02:27.675 --> 00:02:30.798
We're saying, this thing happened,
this thing also happened,

00:02:30.798 --> 00:02:32.463
they happened together.

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:34.172
Nor is similar to and,

00:02:34.172 --> 00:02:36.634
but we use it to combine untrue things.

00:02:36.634 --> 00:02:38.711
We use it to express negation.

00:02:38.711 --> 00:02:41.254
So if I were going to talk
about an angry tree spirit,

00:02:41.254 --> 00:02:45.743
for example, just to pull
an example out of a hat,

00:02:45.743 --> 00:02:46.862
I could say,

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:51.029
she won't leave her tree, nor
will she speak with humans.

00:02:52.214 --> 00:02:56.498
We use but to express exceptions, as in...

00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:01.002
We used every building
material but chewing gum.

00:03:01.002 --> 00:03:05.054
Chewing gum is the exception
to every building material.

00:03:05.054 --> 00:03:09.838
We or as a conjunction to
choose between options...

00:03:09.838 --> 00:03:12.043
As in, would you rather have a pet bear

00:03:12.043 --> 00:03:13.599
or a pet giraffe?

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.980
We ask the hard questions on Khan Academy.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.573
Yet is kind of like but,

00:03:18.573 --> 00:03:23.143
except that we use it to
express unexpected things

00:03:23.143 --> 00:03:25.895
so I'm just going to
write, to the contrary!

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:29.644
As if I were Sherlock Holmes
hollering at a confused Watson.

00:03:29.644 --> 00:03:31.862
And to the contrary, my good man Watson!

00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:34.323
This is how we use yet. I'll show you.

00:03:34.323 --> 00:03:37.296
I want to leave, yet I cannot.

00:03:37.296 --> 00:03:39.942
So it sets up this kind of push and pull

00:03:39.942 --> 00:03:42.265
dynamic in a sentence, is what yet does.

00:03:42.265 --> 00:03:44.796
We set the expectation, I want to leave,

00:03:44.796 --> 00:03:48.337
and yet here's the unexpected,
what I'd say an ironic part,

00:03:48.337 --> 00:03:50.543
yet I cannot. I want to leave...

00:03:50.543 --> 00:03:54.114
But unfortunately, or but unexpectedly.

00:03:54.114 --> 00:03:58.903
When you would say but
unexpectedly, just use yet.

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:02.129
And finally, the last part of FANBOYS,

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:03.962
so shows consequences.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.099
Dougal was allergic to sheep,

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:10.489
so he skipped the wool festival.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.881
Right so, so we're trying to set up that

00:04:12.881 --> 00:04:15.888
as a consequence of the first clause,

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:17.025
Dougal being allergic to sheep,

00:04:17.025 --> 00:04:19.784
the thing that follows
is, because of that,

00:04:19.784 --> 00:04:22.710
he decided to skip the wool festival.

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.793
This is FANBOYS, For, And,
Nor, But, Or, Yet, So.

00:04:28.074 --> 00:04:29.933
These are all covered in the exercises.

00:04:29.933 --> 00:04:31.232
You can learn anything.

00:04:31.232 --> 00:04:32.065
David out.
