00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.730
 
so we focused attention on some of the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:05.740
so we focused attention on some of the
 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.410
so we focused attention on some of the
behaviors on the very dark side of the

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:07.420
behaviors on the very dark side of the
 

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.120
behaviors on the very dark side of the
spectrum of hopefulness and optimism

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130
spectrum of hopefulness and optimism
 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.310
spectrum of hopefulness and optimism
which is suicidal behaviors and we dug

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:11.320
which is suicidal behaviors and we dug
 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.320
which is suicidal behaviors and we dug
into that literature we saw the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330
into that literature we saw the
 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.780
into that literature we saw the
importance of suicide as a cause of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790
importance of suicide as a cause of
 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.090
importance of suicide as a cause of
death for young people and for teenagers

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100
death for young people and for teenagers
 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.980
death for young people and for teenagers
it's the number two cause of death for I

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990
it's the number two cause of death for I
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.500
it's the number two cause of death for I

think ages 15 to 19 in the United States
 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.960
think ages 15 to 19 in the United States
and the a lot of the scholarship that's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:24.970
and the a lot of the scholarship that's
 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.150
and the a lot of the scholarship that's
focused on suicide has focused on

focused on suicide has focused on
 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.150
focused on suicide has focused on
individual risk factors both genetics

individual risk factors both genetics
 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.600

and the presence of physical and

and the presence of physical and
emotional pain and what we wanted to do

emotional pain and what we wanted to do
 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.380
emotional pain and what we wanted to do
is think a little bit broader about

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390
is think a little bit broader about
 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.810
is think a little bit broader about
social contagion and social processes

related to suicide in processes of
 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.310
related to suicide in processes of
social contagion and suicide have been

social contagion and suicide have been
 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.740
social contagion and suicide have been
also been under study because social

contagion and social processes for
adolescents suicide often comes up in

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190
adolescents suicide often comes up in
 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.970
adolescents suicide often comes up in
the news when a celebrity commits

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980
the news when a celebrity commits
 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.690
the news when a celebrity commits
suicide and there and there are there

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700
suicide and there and there are there
 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.500
suicide and there and there are there
are public policies for the media not to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510
are public policies for the media not to
 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
are public policies for the media not to
report celebrity suicides in order to

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760
report celebrity suicides in order to
 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.029
report celebrity suicides in order to
not have spikes of adolescents commit

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039
not have spikes of adolescents commit
 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:08.969
not have spikes of adolescents commit
suicide as copycatting and more recently

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979
suicide as copycatting and more recently
 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.949
suicide as copycatting and more recently
the media is being trained and if there

00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:10.959
the media is being trained and if there
 

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:13.739
the media is being trained and if there
is a celebrity suicide to report the

00:01:13.739 --> 00:01:13.749
is a celebrity suicide to report the
 

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.019
is a celebrity suicide to report the
story but also report hotlines and

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:16.029
story but also report hotlines and
 

00:01:16.029 --> 00:01:17.639
story but also report hotlines and
information for adolescents who are

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649
information for adolescents who are
 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.289
information for adolescents who are
feeling the same way so there's a lot of

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299
feeling the same way so there's a lot of
 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:21.449
feeling the same way so there's a lot of
public policy interest in the potential

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459
public policy interest in the potential
 

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.269
public policy interest in the potential
for contagion and suicide so we focus

00:01:24.269 --> 00:01:24.279
for contagion and suicide so we focus
 

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:26.069
for contagion and suicide so we focus
some attention on that in our study too

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:26.079
some attention on that in our study too
 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:29.279
some attention on that in our study too
so what we did was we again survey data

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289
so what we did was we again survey data
 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.069
so what we did was we again survey data
that had information on suicide and to

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079
that had information on suicide and to
 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:34.889
that had information on suicide and to
think about social processes we found

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:34.899
think about social processes we found
 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:38.580
think about social processes we found
data that had not just your own suicidal

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590
data that had not just your own suicidal
 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.099
data that had not just your own suicidal
attempts or suicidality but also whether

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109
attempts or suicidality but also whether
 

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.139
attempts or suicidality but also whether
or not family members had recently

00:01:43.139 --> 00:01:43.149
or not family members had recently
 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.999
or not family members had recently
committed suicide and our thinking was

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009
committed suicide and our thinking was
 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.370
committed suicide and our thinking was
in order to trace a social process we

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380
in order to trace a social process we
 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.499
in order to trace a social process we
wanted to see in some sense patient zero

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:49.509
wanted to see in some sense patient zero
 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.449
wanted to see in some sense patient zero
which would be a family member having

00:01:51.449 --> 00:01:51.459
which would be a family member having
 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:53.249
which would be a family member having
committed suicide and then traced that

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259
committed suicide and then traced that
 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.529
committed suicide and then traced that
through an adolescent social network so

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539
through an adolescent social network so
 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.719
through an adolescent social network so
we measured family suicides that

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729
we measured family suicides that
 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.849
we measured family suicides that
occurred in the previous year we examine

00:01:59.849 --> 00:01:59.859
occurred in the previous year we examine
 

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:01.739
occurred in the previous year we examine
the impacts on the adolescents in the

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749
the impacts on the adolescents in the
 

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:04.559
the impacts on the adolescents in the
families that had family suicides but

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569
families that had family suicides but
 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.239
families that had family suicides but
then we pivoted and asked the question

00:02:06.239 --> 00:02:06.249
then we pivoted and asked the question
 

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:08.729
then we pivoted and asked the question
well do those family processes spill

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:08.739
well do those family processes spill
 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:10.979
well do those family processes spill
over into the classroom so we examined

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989
over into the classroom so we examined
 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.780
over into the classroom so we examined
the impact of having a class

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790
the impact of having a class
 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.910
the impact of having a class
eight who had a family member commit

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920
eight who had a family member commit
 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.339
eight who had a family member commit
suicide in the last year and again we

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349
suicide in the last year and again we
 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.009
suicide in the last year and again we
found very large defects that seemed to

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019
found very large defects that seemed to
 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.149
found very large defects that seemed to
work through having a classmate's family

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159
work through having a classmate's family
 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.860
work through having a classmate's family
member commit suicide affecting the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870
member commit suicide affecting the
 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.899
member commit suicide affecting the
classmate him or herself that then

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:27.909
classmate him or herself that then
 

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.149
classmate him or herself that then
spills over into the classroom on the

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159
spills over into the classroom on the
 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.339
spills over into the classroom on the
suicidal behaviors of those who are not

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349
suicidal behaviors of those who are not
 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:34.710
suicidal behaviors of those who are not
directly affected and the other

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720
directly affected and the other
 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.369
directly affected and the other
surprising finding in that study was

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379
surprising finding in that study was
 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.410
surprising finding in that study was
that these pathways between a family

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420
that these pathways between a family
 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.459
that these pathways between a family
member committing suicide and adolescent

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:43.469
member committing suicide and adolescent
 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:45.690
member committing suicide and adolescent
increasing their suicidality and then

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700
increasing their suicidality and then
 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.819
increasing their suicidality and then
spilling over into the classroom is that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829
spilling over into the classroom is that
 

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.210
spilling over into the classroom is that
that process only follows gender lines

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220
that process only follows gender lines
 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.659
that process only follows gender lines
meaning that it's if I'm oh if I'm a

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669
meaning that it's if I'm oh if I'm a
 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.520
meaning that it's if I'm oh if I'm a
female student in the classroom it only

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530
female student in the classroom it only
 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.559
female student in the classroom it only
matters to me whether females in my

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569
matters to me whether females in my
 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.179
matters to me whether females in my
classroom had family members who have

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189
classroom had family members who have
 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.399
classroom had family members who have
committed suicide the males in my

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409
committed suicide the males in my
 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.259
committed suicide the males in my
classroom who had family members commit

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269
classroom who had family members commit
 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.050
classroom who had family members commit
suicide does not affect my suicidality

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060
suicide does not affect my suicidality
 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.490
suicide does not affect my suicidality
so there's a very I think intriguing and

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500
so there's a very I think intriguing and
 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.170
so there's a very I think intriguing and
surprising finding it says something

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180
surprising finding it says something
 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.449
surprising finding it says something
both on the potential for spill overs

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459
both on the potential for spill overs
 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.140
both on the potential for spill overs
for contagion in suicide but also that

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150
for contagion in suicide but also that
 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.460
for contagion in suicide but also that
it's a little bit more complicated

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470
it's a little bit more complicated
 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.800
it's a little bit more complicated
because once it moves into the classroom

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
because once it moves into the classroom
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.830
because once it moves into the classroom
I think these suicide contagions take

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840
I think these suicide contagions take
 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.379
I think these suicide contagions take
advantage of pre-existing networks where

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389
advantage of pre-existing networks where
 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.119
advantage of pre-existing networks where
girls are friends with girls and boys

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129
girls are friends with girls and boys
 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.589
girls are friends with girls and boys
are friends with boys inside classrooms

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:28.599
are friends with boys inside classrooms
 

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:30.719
are friends with boys inside classrooms
and when a bad thing happens to a

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:30.729
and when a bad thing happens to a
 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:33.030
and when a bad thing happens to a
classmate's family then that seat that

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040
classmate's family then that seat that
 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.129
classmate's family then that seat that
that news and those effects seem to

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:35.139
that news and those effects seem to
 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:37.439
that news and those effects seem to
travel on gender specific lines and

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:37.449
travel on gender specific lines and
 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.659
travel on gender specific lines and
similar to the child abuse examination

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669
similar to the child abuse examination
 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.550
similar to the child abuse examination
where we found that family member or

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560
where we found that family member or
 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.170
where we found that family member or
family processes spilled into the

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180
family processes spilled into the
 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.449
family processes spilled into the
classroom there's a policy implication

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459
classroom there's a policy implication
 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.219
classroom there's a policy implication
here that's that successful suicide

00:03:47.219 --> 00:03:47.229
here that's that successful suicide
 

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:50.129
here that's that successful suicide
prevention programs again have this

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:50.139
prevention programs again have this
 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:51.869
prevention programs again have this
potential for spilling over on people

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879
potential for spilling over on people
 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.610
potential for spilling over on people
who aren't treated themselves or who

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620
who aren't treated themselves or who
 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.500
who aren't treated themselves or who
aren't intervene on themselves if you

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510
aren't intervene on themselves if you
 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.689
aren't intervene on themselves if you
can successfully prevent a suicide in

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:57.699
can successfully prevent a suicide in
 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:59.490
can successfully prevent a suicide in
our case in a family member that

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500
our case in a family member that
 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.009
our case in a family member that
actually reduces the likelihood of a

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019
actually reduces the likelihood of a
 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.099
actually reduces the likelihood of a
suicide attempt in both the adolescent

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109
suicide attempt in both the adolescent
 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.619
suicide attempt in both the adolescent
in the family but also the adolescents

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629
in the family but also the adolescents
 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.280
in the family but also the adolescents
classmates so again we this has the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290
classmates so again we this has the
 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:13.409
classmates so again we this has the
possibility of a larger bang for your

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419
possibility of a larger bang for your
 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:15.629
possibility of a larger bang for your
buck where you spend money to reduce

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639
buck where you spend money to reduce
 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.789
buck where you spend money to reduce
suicide or spend money to prevent

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799
suicide or spend money to prevent
 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.310
suicide or spend money to prevent
suicide in a single family that's but

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320
suicide in a single family that's but
 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.560
suicide in a single family that's but
you gain the benefits of both the family

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570
you gain the benefits of both the family
 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.790
you gain the benefits of both the family
and the classmates of the family

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800
and the classmates of the family
 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:32.769
