00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.540
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: So today
I'm really excited because we

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.260
have two very special guests.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.160
The first has been on YouTube
for about five years, which

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.520
is like a really long
time in YouTube history.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.700
So you're like, actually, one
of our original rock stars.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.530
Kandee Johnson, so come
on to the stage Kandee.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.810
So Kandee's channel is
pretty easy to remember.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.910
It's youtube.com/kandeejohnson.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.340
And you now have almost
two million subscribers.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.137
You've been on the platform
for a while, you're a mom,

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:32.220
you're kind of like this
modern Renaissance woman.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.080
KANDEE JOHNSON: Thanks.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.530
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Why do we just

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.530
take a quick peek at
one of Kandee's videos,

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.600
so you can see what the
content looks like on YouTube.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.100
[MUSIC PLAYING] _ _ _ _ _ _

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.421
_ _ _ _ _ _

00:00:45.421 --> 00:00:46.420
KANDEE JOHNSON: Hi guys.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.960
It's Kandee, and I haven't
done a tag video in so long.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.580
So this is going
to be so much fun.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.510
So I'm going to be
doing the TMI tag.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.850
And if you don't
know, TMI stands

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.975
for "too much information."

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:58.350
So you're going to learn a
little too much information

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.450
about myself.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:02.301
And I was tagged by Sammi,
from beautycrush, who I love.

00:01:02.301 --> 00:01:03.985
So thank you for
tagging me Sammi.

00:01:03.985 --> 00:01:05.530
OK, so let's get started.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.480
The first question is,
what are you wearing?

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.030
I'm wearing my
"What's Sup?" shirt.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.160
And you can't see it, but like,
I'm wearing my boyfriend jeans,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.030
and--

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.570
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
So you guys get it,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.440
it's really fun, the TMI tag is
kind of blowing up right now,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.640
which is kind of cool.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.680
But Kandee, how did you
get started on Youtube?

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.990
Tell us a little bit about
that, and your channel,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.734
and your message.

00:01:22.734 --> 00:01:24.150
KANDEE JOHNSON:
Well I got started

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.280
because one of my
friends, he actually

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.850
showed me a video of Lauren
Luke in the UK, panacea81.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.920
And I saw her video,
and the only thing

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.870
I had noticed for
YouTube before was like,

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.370
oh that's where you go when you
see like a cat water skiing,

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.820
or like you see some
dumb funny video.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.900
And I thought it
was genius, I was

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.330
like, she's doing
a makeup-- she's

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.780
using YouTube to do a tutorial?

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.550
Like I was blown away.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.729
And I just fell in love
with her, because I'm like,

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.270
I feel like I'm her best friend,
and she doesn't know it yet.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.822
And I was like, I could do this.

00:01:54.822 --> 00:01:57.030
I was a makeup artist before,
like in TV, and movies,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.040
and all that stuff.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.522
And I had moved
away from LA, which

00:01:59.522 --> 00:02:00.980
I thought was
horrible at the time.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.750
I was like, I'm moving
away from my dream,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.200
like this is so awful.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.676
And when I was there, my
friend showed me the video,

00:02:07.676 --> 00:02:09.550
and he's like, this is--
you can still teach.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.210
You can still feel creative.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.420
And so I was like, I
will share all my tips

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.260
that I know as a makeup artist.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.226
And my first video
you don't even see me,

00:02:17.226 --> 00:02:19.350
and I had a cold, so it
doesn't even sound like me.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.780
And I--

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.080
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do you
remember what a video was?

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.510
KANDEE JOHNSON:It was how to
clean your makeup brushes.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.380
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
I've seen that video.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.820
I use that, by the way.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:25.659
The olive oil--

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:26.700
KANDEE JOHNSON: It works.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.810
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:Yeah
you use olive oil--

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.340
KANDEE JOHNSON: It
conditions your bristles--

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.215
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Yeah, so I use that trip.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:31.340
That tip that you gave.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.173
KANDEE JOHNSON: Yay.

00:02:32.173 --> 00:02:33.070
I'm kind of honored.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:34.430
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:Yeah, it's
amazing because if you look

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.675
at your content now,
it has evolved so much.

00:02:36.675 --> 00:02:39.050
KANDEE JOHNSON:Oh my gosh, I
didn't even know how you got

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.020
things onto YouTube.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.980
I YouTubed how to YouTube.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.100
I would type into
YouTube, I'm like,

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.380
"how to get things from your
camera on your computer."

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.965
I didn't even know how to word
it right in the search bar.

00:02:49.965 --> 00:02:51.170
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's amazing, yeah.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.628
KANDEE JOHNSON: I learned how
to edit on YouTube, I'm like,

00:02:53.628 --> 00:02:56.650
"how to make it words
on your picture video."

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.749
Like it was so ridiculous.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.540
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Were you always though,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.600
into makeup, and kind
of the beauty space?

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.291
I know that you also modeled,
and you did celebrity makeup.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:08.620
KANDEE JOHNSON: Oh yeah,
I've always loved beauty,

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.190
and the thing is, people would
always be in my chair working.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.330
And it would always
be the everyday woman

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.330
that would be sitting
there, or even celebrities

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.760
would be like, how did
you learn how to do this?

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.011
How come I never learned this?

00:03:19.011 --> 00:03:20.968
My mother taught me, I
wish you could teach me.

00:03:20.968 --> 00:03:22.880
Wish you would come
to my makeup everyday.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:23.780
And then when I came
[? up with YouTube ?] I'm like,

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.770
I can kind of be in your
bathroom everyday with you

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.796
when you do your
makeup, and teaching

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:29.920
stuff that you don't learn.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680
You don't learn-- I
went to beauty school,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.650
and I didn't learn
how to do makeup.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:33.150
So--

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.775
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And I think
it's funny because-- I actually

00:03:35.775 --> 00:03:38.340
got married a couple years
ago-- and when I was looking

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.180
for my looks, what I was
going to go down the aisle--

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.100
KANDEE JOHNSON: Your
princess moment--

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.300
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Might look, I actually

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.650
used a video from your channel.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.920
KANDEE JOHNSON: You did?

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.350
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:It was the
Taylor Swift, "Love Story."

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.725
KANDEE JOHNSON:It's
so beautiful!

00:03:48.725 --> 00:03:50.780
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Yes,
so I took the video,

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.177
I sent it to my makeup
artist for the wedding,

00:03:53.177 --> 00:03:54.510
and I was like, can you do this?

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.670
I bought all the products,
every single product.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:00.570
She ended up
referencing the video,

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.210
and she's like I learned
stuff from the video.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.790
And then she emailed
me and was like,

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.892
how can I be a YouTube star?

00:04:06.892 --> 00:04:08.800
And I was like, OK,
that's another--

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.800
KANDEE JOHNSON:I'm like,
are you ready for that,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.174
because there's more
than just being "funzey."

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:15.090
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:So
OK, going way, way back,

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.420
when you were doing
celebrity makeup,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.360
do you have any juicy stories?

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.370
Who did you work with?

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.890
I think I saw the worked
with Janice Dickinson.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:24.615
KANDEE JOHNSON:
She was the last,

00:04:24.615 --> 00:04:26.420
because then I tapered
off, because YouTube

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.470
took over my life.

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.010
And then I had no
time to do that.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.840
So I think Janice Dickinson, and
Conan O'Brien were the last two

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.610
that I did while I was
still doing YouTube.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.195
So it was really--
that was weird

00:04:37.195 --> 00:04:39.070
because I was so used
to editing, and things,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.230
and then to still
do a job, and then I

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.120
couldn't post pictures
about it, because you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.920
can't show that stuff.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.155
So that was really weird.

00:04:46.155 --> 00:04:47.140
KANDEE JOHNSON:So you
kind of realized, wow,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.550
I have this budding business.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.010
And now you're kind of like a
celebrity in your own right.

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.140
Which I think is
really exciting.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.220
Do you get recognized?

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.730
Like when you're
out on the street?

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.521
KANDEE JOHNSON:Yeah,
and it's really weird,

00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.880
because like I don't feel
like I'm a celebrity at all,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.435
so it's so weird.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:04.310
Because at first, when
somebody would come up

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.360
and they'd be
like, oh hi Kandee,

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.610
and I'd be like, oh my gosh,
I don't know your name.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:08.370
Do I know you from work?

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.960
School?

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.270
My brain would just be going
a million miles an hour--

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.640
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
You're kind of panicking--

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:12.630
KANDEE JOHNSON: And
they would just kind of

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.380
stand there like, hi Kandee.

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.400
And I'm like, hi.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.641
I don't know what to say now.

00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:19.640
And then they'd be like,
I watch you on YouTube.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.780
And I was like, (SIGHS) I don't
need to know your name right

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:23.620
this second, hooray.

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.422
But it's still--

00:05:25.422 --> 00:05:27.213
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:It's
still wacky, right?

00:05:27.213 --> 00:05:28.120
KANDEE JOHNSON:It's still weird.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.494
I was not popular
in high school,

00:05:29.494 --> 00:05:32.087
so that anybody knows me
I'm like, you know my name?

00:05:32.087 --> 00:05:33.554
Oh my gosh, you know my name.

00:05:33.554 --> 00:05:34.872
Oh, my goodness.

00:05:34.872 --> 00:05:36.830
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Would
you say you were shy?

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:38.664
A shyer person before
you came onto YouTube?

00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:40.621
KANDEE JOHNSON: I was
super shy in high school,

00:05:40.621 --> 00:05:41.850
like I didn't talk, ever.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.310
I would just sit and
eat lunch by myself,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.518
because I was too scared
people would make fun of me,

00:05:45.518 --> 00:05:47.202
I'm like, if I say
hello, they will

00:05:47.202 --> 00:05:49.785
make fun of how I say hello, so
I'll just eat with my teacher.

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:53.430
I was so not cool in
high school, at all.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.625
I had things to say, but
I was so terrified people

00:05:55.625 --> 00:05:56.500
would make fun of me.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.614
I'm like, I'll just keep
every idea I have inside.

00:05:58.614 --> 00:06:00.280
And no one will make
fun of me that way.

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.490
So it's so weird now.

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:06.930
It just feels so crazy to me,
like anybody would like me,

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.520
because you felt so
unlikable before.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.982
I'm like, you really like me?

00:06:09.982 --> 00:06:11.106
You really watch my videos?

00:06:11.106 --> 00:06:11.962
Oh my gosh.

00:06:11.962 --> 00:06:13.086
I get so excited.

00:06:13.086 --> 00:06:14.460
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's so cool.

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:16.490
I was listening,
actually, to this podcast.

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.030
It was talking about people
that changed your life.

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.560
I think what's really
interesting about YouTube

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.520
is that you hear from your
fans all the time, how

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.920
you changed their life.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.840
And hearing from
someone who maybe

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.510
was typically shy
in high school,

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.400
and now has this whole
following on YouTube,

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.435
I think that's a really
inspirational story.

00:06:34.435 --> 00:06:36.060
KANDEE JOHNSON:I hope
it inspires them.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:37.670
It makes them feel like it's OK.

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.130
It's OK if you're
terrified to say any words.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.430
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: But
everybody also has trolls.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.620
Which is another
thing about YouTube.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.010
So how do you deal with some of
the, the naysaying, and the--

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.214
KANDEE JOHNSON: It was
hard because at first,

00:06:50.214 --> 00:06:51.880
I had dealt with girls
being mean to me,

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.010
and saying mean things to
me in school, and stuff.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.420
But never like YouTube.

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.530
I've been told everything, my
eyes are ugly, my nose is ugly.

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.850
I look like a man.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.450
The sound of my voice is
annoying, I should kill myself.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.237
I've just been told everything.

00:07:05.237 --> 00:07:07.570
Like, oh your next video
should be you killing yourself.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:09.887
I just wasted 10
minutes of my life.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:12.470
I'm like, well you just wasted
30 more typing me this comment.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:15.272
I'm like, "whaaaa," this
is is so irritating.

00:07:15.272 --> 00:07:16.730
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
And I guess you

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:18.880
just kind of have to learn
how to filter it out, and--

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.296
KANDEE JOHNSON:
Well, and then you

00:07:20.296 --> 00:07:22.070
learn not everybody's
mentally sound.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.755
They're just sitting
behind a keyboard.

00:07:24.755 --> 00:07:26.390
I learned don't ever respond.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:28.150
And don't ever type
back, well you're

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.310
not putting your
face on YouTube,

00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:32.440
you ugly person
behind your computer.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.930
I would never reply,
never respond.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.550
I will respond nicely.

00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:39.095
So this one girl wrote me this
thing, you look like a man,

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:40.500
you ratchet face, blah blah.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.510
She just went on, and on,
just tearing me apart.

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.102
And so I clicked on her profile
picture, and I was like,

00:07:46.102 --> 00:07:47.066
oh she's really pretty.

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.440
And so I just wrote back, I'm
like, you are so beautiful.

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.740
It's so sad that you just
let such ugly words come out

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:53.114
your mouth, because
I would never

00:07:53.114 --> 00:07:54.780
see something like that to you.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.876
The girl totally did a 180.

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:00.405
She was like, I'm so sorry, I
was having the worst day ever.

00:08:00.405 --> 00:08:02.280
And I was like, I hope
your day feels better,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.790
and I hope if you have another
bad day, that you choose

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.200
to make somebody else feel
better, because in turn, it

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:08.610
will help your day feel better.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.770
You just made yourself
feel uglier on the inside.

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:12.730
And you just totally
ruined my night

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.161
by saying all that junk to me.

00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:16.660
And then by the end, I was like,
I send you a bunch of hugs,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.590
you know, I hope
you feel better.

00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:17.920
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's kind of

00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.421
like a hallmark of
your channel too.

00:08:19.421 --> 00:08:20.420
KANDEE JOHNSON: My hugs.

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:21.250
My virtual hugs.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:21.590
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
You're very inspiring,

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:23.590
you're always about making
someone's day better.

00:08:23.590 --> 00:08:25.881
KANDEE JOHNSON:And she turned
around to me, she's like,

00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:27.322
I love you, and I send you hugs.

00:08:27.322 --> 00:08:29.190
I'm like, from
ratchet face to love.

00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.170
This is crazy.

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:34.175
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's
a touching moment, where

00:08:34.175 --> 00:08:36.049
you realize that you
actually have an impact,

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:38.289
and someone changed
the way that way--

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.205
KANDEE JOHNSON: And it
wasn't like, I am ugly.

00:08:40.205 --> 00:08:41.770
I am a ratchet
face, or whatever.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:44.020
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do you
have a favorite fan moment?

00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.706
Or one thing that
really touched you?

00:08:45.706 --> 00:08:46.830
KANDEE JOHNSON: Oh my gosh.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.829
It was probably the first
girl that ever sent me

00:08:48.829 --> 00:08:51.930
an email that was like-- and
it was shortly after I started.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:54.169
And she sent me an
email, and it makes

00:08:54.169 --> 00:08:55.960
me want to cry every
time I tell the story.

00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.666
But she sent me an
email, and she's

00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.400
like, I was going
to commit suicide,

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.050
and I wanted to look pretty
when people discovered me.

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:06.180
And just that thought
alone was like, ah,

00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:07.690
my heart just broke for her.

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:10.650
And she said, "I typed in pretty
makeup, and for some reason

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.740
your video was the top that
came up on my search at Google."

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:16.089
And I was just like,
oh my goodness,

00:09:16.089 --> 00:09:18.130
and she said, "I want you
to know that it's like,

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.840
seven hours later, and I
just watched your video

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.360
straight through, and
just seeing your story,

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.270
and seeing what
you've been through,

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.728
and your outlook and attitude,"
she said, "I'm still alive.

00:09:24.728 --> 00:09:26.640
And you gave me
hope to keep going."

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.610
And I was like, this
is where people say,

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.700
oh beauty's so superficial,
bunch of lipstick, and mascara.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:33.250
And my [INAUDIBLE]
thing is that I

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:34.820
feel that makeup
is an invitation

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.640
for your inner
confidence to come out.

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.970
It's nothing about this outside.

00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:41.740
It's what it does to your heart
that makes a woman that, maybe

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:43.640
she's been beaten,
abused, or been

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.100
told she's ugly, or horrible.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.016
And for her to feel beautiful,
she's going to walk different.

00:09:48.016 --> 00:09:49.266
She's going to talk different.

00:09:49.266 --> 00:09:50.590
She's going to act differently.

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:52.080
It doesn't matter
how many layers,

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.300
or not layers of mascara
or blush she has on.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.380
It's about what she feels like.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:57.517
And that is what--

00:09:57.517 --> 00:09:59.350
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's what you guys do.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.520
That's the amazing thing about
the beauty category on YouTube,

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.350
and I'm going to invite
Meg up too, because I think

00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:07.960
she probably has
similar moments.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.411
And also, I know that you
probably have inspired her,

00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:10.910
as well.

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.160
I know that you're a fan.

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.395
And so why don't we actually
open the conversation

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:15.270
up a little bit more.

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.580
We'll invite Meg, whose
channel is ciaoobelllaxo.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.790
She's been on YouTube
also for about four years?

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:23.360
Five years.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.690
She has about
500,000 subscribers,

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:26.920
also huge on the platform.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.920
So we'll show a quick
clip, and you can come up,

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:31.310
and we'll continue
the conversation.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.220
MEGAN KROH:Hey guys.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.690
Today, I'm doing a
get ready with me.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:41.070
This has been long awaited
for, and finally getting around

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:42.080
to do it.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.650
So you guys can see, how I
do my foundation, everything.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:47.070
I'm showing all of my makeup.

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:49.320
And I didn't show my hair,
because this was just

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.110
a super simple hairstyle that
I did today with my sockbun.

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:54.310
A hair tutorial, if
you have not seen that,

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.570
I'll link it down below.

00:10:55.570 --> 00:10:58.500
And also I'm going to
show my outfit for today.

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.540
So I hope you guys
enjoy, and keep

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.272
watching if you want to see
how I did my makeup today.

00:11:03.272 --> 00:11:05.730
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Tell us a
little bit about your channel

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:08.110
too, and how you got started.

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:11.940
MEGAN KROH: I got started
when I was in high school.

00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:17.960
I was going into my junior year,
and beauty was never really

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.580
anything I thought about.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.330
I wasn't really that
talented with makeup.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:24.246
I liked applying makeup,
and things like that.

00:11:24.246 --> 00:11:26.190
But actually, it's
so funny that you

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:28.750
mention Lauren Luke, because
she was the first person that I

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:29.250
saw.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.374
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I think
she's the first person.

00:11:31.374 --> 00:11:34.060
She really kind of
started this whole thing.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:37.070
And it's been an inspiration I
think for so many beauty gurus

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.370
too, and I know some
people hate that word.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:39.550
MEGAN KROH: Yeah, I do.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.260
KANDEE JOHNSON: I know,
the word "guru" just

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.420
makes me want to vomit.

00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:45.190
I'm like, bleh, can we
please stop using it,

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.170
and make up a new word?

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:48.461
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:But I
think everybody's seen Lauren,

00:11:48.461 --> 00:11:49.410
so that's really cool.

00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:51.510
And then you've been
doing it since then?

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.468
MEGAN KROH: M-hm, yeah.

00:11:52.468 --> 00:11:55.414
I think I looked up some prom
makeup, or something like that.

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:57.080
And she was the first
person that I saw.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.700
And I just got
addicted to her videos.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.908
And I was like you know what?

00:11:59.908 --> 00:12:01.380
I think I'm going to do this.

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.810
I'm going to put
myself out there.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:04.740
And I didn't really have that
many friends in high school.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:06.115
And I felt like
I couldn't really

00:12:06.115 --> 00:12:07.550
connect with that many people.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:09.840
So YouTube is the way to go.

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:10.717
That's what I did.

00:12:10.717 --> 00:12:11.550
Made my first video.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:13.383
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And
that's another thing

00:12:13.383 --> 00:12:16.486
cool about the platform,
is I feel like I meet fans,

00:12:16.486 --> 00:12:17.860
and I meet YouTubers
all the time

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.010
who are saying like, I
feel like I know you.

00:12:21.010 --> 00:12:23.150
They're saying, I feel
like you're my best friend.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:25.620
Or I have a million best
friends on my channel.

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.911
KANDEE JOHNSON: And you're
talking right in the camera,

00:12:27.911 --> 00:12:30.370
so it feels like you're directly
talking to the person too.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.786
So I feel like that when I
meet other YouTubers, I'm like,

00:12:32.786 --> 00:12:34.843
you're not in my
phone, or [INAUDIBLE],

00:12:34.843 --> 00:12:37.490
you're really here,
it's so weird.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:39.365
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: So
how do you guys-- both

00:12:39.365 --> 00:12:41.239
have been on the platform
for a little while.

00:12:41.239 --> 00:12:43.140
How do you continue
to find inspiration?

00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:44.681
Like where you go
when you're looking

00:12:44.681 --> 00:12:46.780
for the topic for
your next video?

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:50.130
Is it fan sourced, is it
a combination of things?

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.060
Are you looking at trends?

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.900
MEGAN KROH: I go to
Pinterest sometimes.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.830
I love Pinterest.

00:12:56.830 --> 00:12:58.394
I have an addiction.

00:12:58.394 --> 00:12:59.810
But I don't know,
sometimes if I'm

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:03.180
looking to do a new makeup
look, or something, or maybe

00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:05.990
an outfit of the day,
whatever season it is,

00:13:05.990 --> 00:13:09.220
I'll go to Pinterest, and look
at fashion, or makeup trends,

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:10.270
or something like that.

00:13:10.270 --> 00:13:11.930
I like the Pinterest.

00:13:11.930 --> 00:13:14.460
So that's one thing that I do.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:17.340
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do you ever
respond to the fan requests,

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.410
"Can we do this? "

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.390
KANDEE JOHNSON: That's how I
started my first few videos,

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:22.190
because I'd, "Comment below
on what you want to see."

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.315
Or I'd give them
the option, like do

00:13:23.315 --> 00:13:24.606
you want to see Kim Kardashian?

00:13:24.606 --> 00:13:26.380
Do you want to see Kat Von D?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:27.402
You want to see who?

00:13:27.402 --> 00:13:29.610
And then I would just see
whoever commented the most,

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.526
and that's where it feels
like a relationship.

00:13:31.526 --> 00:13:33.802
Where I'm like, tell me
what you want to see?

00:13:33.802 --> 00:13:35.760
You feel like you're
like, "I'm your performer,

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.343
just show me what
you want me to do. "

00:13:37.343 --> 00:13:38.940
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Exactly.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.440
You do the Groucho Marx thing.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.648
You want to see Groucho Marx?

00:13:41.648 --> 00:13:43.510
KANDEE JOHNSON: Yeah,
I'll do that too.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:45.051
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
And another thing

00:13:45.051 --> 00:13:47.410
that I guess for me is kind
of a point of interest, is

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:50.770
do you look at your data on
the back end from your YouTube

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.300
Analytics perspective, and
see what's performing well,

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:55.560
and kind of tweak
the kind of content

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.282
that you make based on that?

00:13:57.282 --> 00:13:58.990
Do you ever look at
your-- because that's

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.414
the kind of stuff I geek out on.

00:14:00.414 --> 00:14:01.830
I look at videos,
and I'm like, oh

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:03.180
where was the drop off point?

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:06.990
Or where do people
really show interest?

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:08.820
You're using a lot
of that backup stuff?

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:09.550
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well I
think it's dangerous,

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:10.870
because it makes
you-- like at first,

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:12.850
I would get really
addicted to stat checking,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:14.686
like I would check
like three times a day.

00:14:14.686 --> 00:14:16.227
I'd be like, how
views did I get now?

00:14:16.227 --> 00:14:16.674
What about lunchtime?

00:14:16.674 --> 00:14:17.890
Is it better at nighttime?

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:19.700
I would just like,
freak out about it.

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.820
And I was like, stop it.

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.070
Just make stuff, and then
stop looking at your numbers,

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:27.504
or you're going to just make
yourself into a crazy person.

00:14:27.504 --> 00:14:28.920
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Yeah, exactly.

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:30.794
MEGAN KROH: I think it
has its ups and downs.

00:14:30.794 --> 00:14:32.500
It can be good for
you, but then it

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.390
could also be bad if
you do it constantly.

00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.280
I don't do it all
that often, but if I

00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.220
feel like I'm not feeling
very motivated, or I do

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:41.670
need to look at my
statistics, to see OK,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:43.220
what video did they really like?

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.212
What can I do again that will--

00:14:45.212 --> 00:14:47.420
KANDEE JOHNSON: Or it will
be the weirdest video too.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.836
Like some of my
most popular ones,

00:14:48.836 --> 00:14:52.295
are videos I don't like,
or wasn't going to upload.

00:14:52.295 --> 00:14:54.670
And I was like, I have nothing
else, I'll just edit this.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.100
And then it became
like, the most popular.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.975
And I'm like, really?

00:14:56.975 --> 00:14:58.790
Ugh.

00:14:58.790 --> 00:15:00.602
Like that's what's
popular, great.

00:15:00.602 --> 00:15:02.310
The thing I edit for
like days, I'm like,

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:04.160
this is going to wow everyone.

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:07.010
And then, they're like,
no we like crappy one

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:09.710
with the bad lighting, and it's
ugly and you look [INAUDIBLE].

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:10.410
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's funny what

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:11.661
fans gravitate to for sure.

00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:12.910
KANDEE JOHNSON: It's so weird.

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:14.826
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And
to speak to that point

00:15:14.826 --> 00:15:16.870
about, all the work
that goes into it,

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:18.520
I remember a couple
years back we

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.814
were working on something
together for L'Oreal.

00:15:20.814 --> 00:15:22.980
And we talked on the phone
one day, and you're like,

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.271
I was a up all-- I pulled an
all nighter, I was doing--

00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:29.310
and I think sometimes people
just neglect to think about all

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.074
of the work that goes into the
production of your channels.

00:15:32.074 --> 00:15:33.240
Because you're doing it all.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.448
You're doing the shooting,
the editing, the planning,

00:15:35.448 --> 00:15:37.615
the uploading, the megatagging,
like all that stuff.

00:15:37.615 --> 00:15:39.531
KANDEE JOHNSON: And I
think people think like,

00:15:39.531 --> 00:15:42.350
oh just film a little video
and throw it up in 45 minutes,

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:43.320
and that's all.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.840
And you're like oh my gosh.

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.350
Like I edit for days.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:50.377
It's like very long.

00:15:50.377 --> 00:15:52.085
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's a labor of love.

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:53.600
KANDEE JOHNSON: And uploading
isn't just an upload.

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.398
It's so stressful.

00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:56.106
I'm like, I've got to
get the tags right.

00:15:56.106 --> 00:15:57.295
And the description
has to [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:57.295 --> 00:15:58.421
What am I going to call it?

00:15:58.421 --> 00:16:00.628
MEGAN KROH: You're not even
done after you've edited.

00:16:00.628 --> 00:16:02.460
You still got to edit
when it's uploaded.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.450
KANDEE JOHNSON: And
then your thumbnail

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.116
has to shoot fireworks out of
people's eyeballs, it's just

00:16:06.116 --> 00:16:08.996
like, ugh, so much stuff.

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:10.495
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
So how would you

00:16:10.495 --> 00:16:11.660
describe like a typical day?

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.790
Like when you get up,
and you're like, OK.

00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:15.420
I'm going to plan a video
today, or I'm going to shoot.

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:17.495
Like what goes into the process?

00:16:17.495 --> 00:16:19.530
It's probably hard
to boil it down.

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:21.360
KANDEE JOHNSON: It's hard.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.270
It's hard, because
then like, you

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.790
don't have a dedicated studio.

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:28.016
So like, I have to like,
haul all my lights down,

00:16:28.016 --> 00:16:29.140
and put them in my bedroom.

00:16:29.140 --> 00:16:32.010
And then I have to like, I can
only film from certain hours,

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:33.100
because then the sun's
going to come in,

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.380
and it's going to make
it look super ugly.

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.255
So I have like, hurry
and film before the sun

00:16:36.255 --> 00:16:38.010
starts-- it's so stressful.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:39.690
MEGAN KROH: It is
really stressful.

00:16:39.690 --> 00:16:43.100
I do the same thing, because
where I film is my bedroom too.

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.330
So it's like, I
have my workspace

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:48.571
with my computer, my vanity
where I do my makeup, and then

00:16:48.571 --> 00:16:49.070
my bed.

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:51.410
And it's just a cluttered mess.

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:53.743
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And you
have to make sure everything

00:16:53.743 --> 00:16:56.610
looks right, and you have to
light it, and you have to--

00:16:56.610 --> 00:16:58.160
KANDEE JOHNSON: And then
you're running back and forth,

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.400
because you're your own camera
person, and lighting person.

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.410
So I like, put a stuffed
animal on my chair,

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.041
run around the
camera, am I in focus,

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:04.492
going back to the
stuffed animal,

00:17:04.492 --> 00:17:06.910
move the stuffed animal, oh
now I moved that, now I'm not

00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:08.380
where the stuffed animal
was, I'm not focused.

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:10.300
Like it's just so
frustrating some days.

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.131
I'm like, (CRYING).

00:17:11.131 --> 00:17:12.839
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
So how long would you

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.900
say, if you had to
boil, how long would you

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.630
say a typical video takes
you from start to finish?

00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:21.410
From the moment you
shoot, to uploading?

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:24.740
Probably tons of hours, right?

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:28.020
MEGAN KROH: I think it depends
on the video, probably.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:31.070
Tutorials, I feel
take up the most time.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:34.730
But other like short
videos, things like tags--

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:36.710
KANDEE JOHNSON: A
tag video is so easy.

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:37.330
MEGAN KROH: Yeah,
they're pretty easy.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:39.038
KANDEE JOHNSON: It's
like a vacation day.

00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:41.260
But a tutorial's
like, oh my gosh,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.420
now I got to go and run
around and zoom the camera.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.020
And now I'm going to zoom,
and go back and run around.

00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:46.353
Now I've got to show my mascara.

00:17:46.353 --> 00:17:47.650
It's like so stressful.

00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:48.750
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
And then you probably,

00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:51.364
a lot of times you're filming
the voiceovers separately.

00:17:51.364 --> 00:17:53.780
So then you have to go back
and look, after you've edited,

00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.550
and film the voiceover.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:57.606
So I just wanted to
make sure that we

00:17:57.606 --> 00:17:58.980
covered all that
technical stuff.

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:01.140
Because I think it's
really cool that you guys

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.670
are pretty much self-taught.

00:18:02.670 --> 00:18:06.610
Did you ever take Photoshop
classes, or Final Cut classes?

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:08.070
You just kind of learned edit?

00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.210
KANDEE JOHNSON:I
YouTubed everything--

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:11.126
MEGAN KROH:I googled--

00:18:11.126 --> 00:18:13.230
KANDEE JOHNSON: I went
to YouTube university.

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:14.940
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's so funny.

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:17.930
Do you have-- before we get into
the fun stuff, which is really

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.050
going to be all about
makeup, because I want

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:22.330
to talk to you guys about
trends, and what's coming,

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:24.746
do you have any advice for
people out there who might want

00:18:24.746 --> 00:18:27.584
to start a channel, whether
it's beauty, or not?

00:18:27.584 --> 00:18:29.250
KANDEE JOHNSON: I
think always, the rule

00:18:29.250 --> 00:18:30.625
should always be
talk like you're

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:32.920
talking to your friend,
brother, sister,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:34.340
somebody so it's natural.

00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:36.730
I think a lot of
people, sometimes they

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:38.490
feel like they have
to get into character,

00:18:38.490 --> 00:18:40.890
or a different
something, and that's not

00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:41.982
what YouTube is meant for.

00:18:41.982 --> 00:18:44.440
YouTube is meant to be like,
feel like they're your friend.

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.760
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Make it feel intimate.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:46.840
KANDEE JOHNSON: And don't
care about the haters,

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.640
because every single person
I know on YouTube gets

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.960
told they're ugly, they
should kill themselves,

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:54.210
people stalking them, all
kinds of crazy things.

00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:57.520
So just ignore it, know
that everybody gets it.

00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.280
They're not just picking on you.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.354
They say everyone's ugly.

00:19:01.354 --> 00:19:03.020
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Any advice from you?

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:04.410
MEGAN KROH: I would say I agree.

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:07.250
I think you need to be yourself,
because I feel like when anyone

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:10.160
wants to start a channel,
they get inspiration

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.610
from other YouTubers.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:13.900
And they kind of want
to do videos like them,

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:16.070
and not necessarily
be like them,

00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:19.240
but be yourself, and
show your character.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:22.282
Show your talent, and I
think just be yourself.

00:19:22.282 --> 00:19:22.990
Plain and simple.

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:24.210
I tell everyone that.

00:19:24.210 --> 00:19:25.390
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Probably stick with it too,

00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:26.750
because I think a
lot of people think

00:19:26.750 --> 00:19:28.390
they're going to get
onto the platform,

00:19:28.390 --> 00:19:31.560
and immediately build a fan
base, and it's going to be--

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.350
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well it takes
longer a now, because back when

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:37.370
I started, there was very few
of us in the beauty category,

00:19:37.370 --> 00:19:38.130
like at all.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:41.240
And we would all be
on the popular page.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.180
We would just watch and
look for each other.

00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.870
And it's funny because
I'd be at another panel,

00:19:44.870 --> 00:19:46.900
and I'd be talking to Ellen
and Blair, and they'd be like,

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:47.980
well we would look
and see when Kandee

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.980
said she was going to upload.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.990
If she was going
to upload, we were

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.820
going to wait on our video.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:51.819
And I was like, you did?

00:19:51.819 --> 00:19:53.725
You thought I was
that important you

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:55.430
were going to move your video?

00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:56.830
I was kind of honored.

00:19:56.830 --> 00:20:00.550
But it was so funny, because it
was so-- it's not competitive

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:01.050
then.

00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:03.525
And now there's like, hundreds
of thousands of people.

00:20:03.525 --> 00:20:04.140
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's saturated.

00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:05.950
KANDEE JOHNSON: So all day
long, I get girls like,

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:07.700
I know everybody hates
these, but will you

00:20:07.700 --> 00:20:08.640
check my channel out?

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:10.230
And I always tell them
like, don't do this.

00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:12.188
People are going to hate
you right off the bat.

00:20:12.188 --> 00:20:12.990
Go to your friends.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:13.700
Go to your Facebook.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.250
Your Twitter.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.180
That's how--

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:15.990
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Start grassroots.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:17.795
KANDEE JOHNSON: I never went
on somebody's video, and like,

00:20:17.795 --> 00:20:19.180
hey, but go check out mine.

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:22.709
Don't steal somebody's
thunder on their page.

00:20:22.709 --> 00:20:25.250
MEGAN KROH: All those comments
get spammed all automatically,

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:25.625
anyway.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:26.970
KANDEE JOHNSON: And then
people don't like you.

00:20:26.970 --> 00:20:28.715
They're never going to go
watch your video if they

00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:29.330
think you're annoying already.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.930
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
You kind of have

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:31.820
to build your street
cred first, right?

00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:33.120
KANDEE JOHNSON: Yes.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.760
You got to get your
"gangster cred."

00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:36.100
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Exactly.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:37.350
"Gangster cred."

00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.850
Cool.

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:41.180
OK, so that's the business side
of things, and the inspiration,

00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:43.030
and the life as
a YouTuber stuff.

00:20:43.030 --> 00:20:47.830
But we also want to talk about
how do we look as good as you?

00:20:47.830 --> 00:20:50.084
How do we do our makeup right?

00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:52.250
KANDEE JOHNSON: Lots of
pounds and pounds of makeup.

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.520
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do
you wear makeup every day?

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.816
Would you say that you do?

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:55.440
MEGAN KROH: No.

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.870
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Does it
feel good to have an off day?

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.657
I know Saturday and Sunday
rolls around for a lot of women,

00:20:59.657 --> 00:21:00.740
and they're like, (SIGHS).

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.929
OK, my skin can breathe.

00:21:01.929 --> 00:21:03.678
KANDEE JOHNSON: Most
days are my off days.

00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:06.590
Like the days I do videos are
my only makeup days, really.

00:21:06.590 --> 00:21:07.090
Yeah

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:08.350
MEGAN KROH: Pretty much.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:09.350
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
On a normal morning,

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:10.900
if you're going to
go out, how long

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.886
would you say your
makeup routine takes?

00:21:14.886 --> 00:21:17.510
KANDEE JOHNSON: Like on a normal
day that I that I don't wear--

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.560
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Or if you're going

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.820
to go, maybe if you're not
filming, but you're going out.

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.376
Like a normal routine.

00:21:24.376 --> 00:21:25.750
Maybe not filming,
because that's

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:26.791
going to be a different--

00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:29.855
KANDEE JOHNSON: This took
me half an hour today.

00:21:29.855 --> 00:21:31.980
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I guess
it depends on the look.

00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:33.479
I guess what I'm
getting to is like,

00:21:33.479 --> 00:21:35.300
for a career woman,
or someone who

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:38.050
is getting ready in the
morning, maybe is in a hurry--

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:38.780
KANDEE JOHNSON: Ten,
fifteen minutes?

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:40.270
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Yes, is
that a normal amount of time?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:42.636
So it shouldn't
take like two hours?

00:21:42.636 --> 00:21:44.151
KANDEE JOHNSON: No, no.

00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:46.150
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do
you have any golden rules

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:47.860
that you live by?

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.680
Kind of steps that
you would never skip?

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.320
MEGAN KROH: Concealer.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:54.410
Oh gosh, it's a savior.

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.150
Yeah It's amazing.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:22:00.140
KANDEE JOHNSON: And concealer
on your eyelids with eyeshadow,

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:01.670
or powder, then your eye shadow.

00:22:01.670 --> 00:22:04.070
Never just put eye shadow
on your naked lids,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.080
or even with the cream.

00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.954
You need to dry it off
first with the powder.

00:22:06.954 --> 00:22:07.774
That would be my--

00:22:07.774 --> 00:22:08.940
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Love it.

00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.840
KANDEE JOHNSON: Take
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.650
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I'm like
taking mental notes right now.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:17.040
And I guess, do you have
any essential products?

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.250
Do you have ones
that you swear by?

00:22:19.250 --> 00:22:21.050
It doesn't have to
be a brand, per say,

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.160
it could just be-- we
just heard concealer.

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.890
That is a huge trick.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.900
I didn't learn about the
concealer on the eyelid

00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:30.415
until after I took a class
at Sephora, like last week.

00:22:30.415 --> 00:22:31.290
KANDEE JOHNSON: What?

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:32.102
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Not kidding.

00:22:32.102 --> 00:22:32.510
(GASPS)

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:33.220
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Yeah because they

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:35.930
do these free classes at
Sephora, you could sign up.

00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.660
And I took a flawless
foundation class,

00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:39.730
and they were like,
here's a tip for you.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:41.770
And I was like oh, OK.

00:22:41.770 --> 00:22:42.570
That makes sense.

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.420
Like makeup artists have
been doing that for years,

00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:45.600
like you don't need a primer.

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.210
Just put a concealer,
and a powder on.

00:22:47.210 --> 00:22:49.440
And then go to town.

00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:52.860
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: So anything
that you couldn't live without?

00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:56.460
KANDEE JOHNSON: I would go with
concealer, and black eyeliner.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.385
MEGAN KROH: I would say
concealer, and mascara.

00:22:59.385 --> 00:23:01.760
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I think
my favorite product right now

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.315
is one that I just
got from Sephora.

00:23:03.315 --> 00:23:05.665
It's the Urban Decay spray.

00:23:05.665 --> 00:23:07.290
KANDEE JOHNSON: Oh
the all night spray?

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:08.331
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Yeah.

00:23:08.331 --> 00:23:10.160
It like keeps your
foundation on your face.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.010
MEGAN KROH: I would say
that's an essential too.

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:12.560
KANDEE JOHNSON:
There's another one

00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.810
is even stronger
that will water--

00:23:13.810 --> 00:23:14.980
it could rain on your face.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:16.002
And it won't come off.

00:23:16.002 --> 00:23:17.460
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's amazing.

00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:19.150
How do you guys do that stuff?

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.260
When I got my makeup
done for my wedding,

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.460
and anyone who's I married
and had their makeup done,

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:26.370
I just was like, how
is this even possible?

00:23:26.370 --> 00:23:29.380
I got up at like 6:00 AM,
she did my makeup at 7:00.

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:30.910
The wedding was at 9:30.

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:33.120
I went to Jazz
Fest all day long,

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.510
and then I had my reception,
and my face was just, like, on.

00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:42.987
KANDEE JOHNSON: If you apply
it carefully, it will last.

00:23:42.987 --> 00:23:45.070
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: But I
think the other thing is

00:23:45.070 --> 00:23:47.140
for a lot of us,
you don't grow up

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:51.970
learning all those tricks
and tips from your mom.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.570
Is there hope for
the women out there?

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:57.255
Do you think it takes
an artist's touch to--

00:23:57.255 --> 00:23:58.370
KANDEE JOHNSON: No.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:59.065
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do you
think it's accessible--

00:23:59.065 --> 00:24:01.190
KANDEE JOHNSON: I'm impressed
when I see young girls now.

00:24:01.190 --> 00:24:03.106
I'll see them somewhere,
I'm like, oh my gosh.

00:24:03.106 --> 00:24:04.190
Your makeup is amazing.

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:05.010
I couldn't do that when--

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:06.300
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: They're
learning from you guys.

00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:07.000
KANDEE JOHNSON: --I
was fifteen years old.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.130
It's amazing.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:10.386
Because these weren't,
the tricks weren't around,

00:24:10.386 --> 00:24:12.010
and to know how to
do it wasn't around.

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:13.810
And so now that
everybody is sharing it,

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:15.650
I think it's awesome.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.770
I don't think my makeup artist
friends were very happy.

00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:20.680
They're like, why
are we going to work?

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.092
You're giving away
all my tricks.

00:24:22.092 --> 00:24:25.080
I'm like, you want the world
ugly, so you make a dollar.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:25.980
Like that's not nice.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:28.307
Like just share.

00:24:28.307 --> 00:24:30.140
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do
you guys have your go

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.560
to resources for your
beauty news, and stuff?

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.412
Like I'm a dedicated
"Allure" reader,

00:24:34.412 --> 00:24:36.245
and I know that like a
lot of people go to--

00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:38.207
KANDEE JOHNSON: "Allure"
is about the beauty.

00:24:38.207 --> 00:24:40.290
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Any
other kind of, [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:40.290 --> 00:24:41.706
the other thing
that I really like

00:24:41.706 --> 00:24:44.410
is, "People" has a
style watch magazine.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:47.309
And they have the like,
splurge here, save here.

00:24:47.309 --> 00:24:48.850
KANDEE JOHNSON:
Those are always fun.

00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:50.350
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Do you guys have

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:54.380
splurge versus drugstore
buys that you love or hate?

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.100
Or what do you skimp
on versus spend on?

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.397
KANDEE JOHNSON: I think
you can skimp on mascaras

00:25:00.397 --> 00:25:01.480
if you have a good primer.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:03.420
Don't skimp on
foundation or concealer.

00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:07.010
That's where you want to invest
in the priming of the canvas,

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.350
and then you can cheap
up the decoration.

00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:11.641
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's
actually a really good point

00:25:11.641 --> 00:25:13.930
that no one really
teaches you either,

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.240
make sure that you
moisturize, and then prime,

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:18.210
and then put your foundation on.

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:22.502
I didn't even know primer
was a product until recently.

00:25:22.502 --> 00:25:25.670
It's like from watching you
guys, I'm like oh great idea.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.410
KANDEE JOHNSON: And
make sure it doesn't

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:28.650
have dimethicone or silicone,
because it can actually

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:29.130
enlarge your pores.

00:25:29.130 --> 00:25:31.720
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I learned
that at the Sephora last week.

00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:34.340
They said use a water-based one.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:35.470
That Smashbox one.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.230
KANDEE JOHNSON: Because
then they're like hey,

00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:37.750
it'll stretch of out your
pores, and then you'll

00:25:37.750 --> 00:25:38.900
have to buy primer for life.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:39.910
It's like they hook you.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:43.230
It's like horrible, like a drug
for your pores or something.

00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:44.490
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Exactly.

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:45.150
Oh my gosh.

00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:47.112
So let's talk about
trends, like what we think

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.320
is going to be big this year.

00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:51.700
I just learned too that the
Pantone Color of the Year

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:52.800
is orchid.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:55.420
It's actually very similar
to your hair color.

00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.782
[INAUDIBLE] darker.

00:25:57.782 --> 00:25:59.240
KANDEE JOHNSON:
The tube said pink.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.280
It's not pink.

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:02.050
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: So what do
you think is going to be big

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:03.549
this year based on
what you've seen?

00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:05.860
I've heard some people
say the tribal stick

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:07.624
ons for nails, which
I haven't seen.

00:26:07.624 --> 00:26:10.040
KANDEE JOHNSON: Wait, didn't
we get rid of tribal tattoos?

00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:11.660
(MUMBLES)

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.050
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: What do
you really into right now?

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:15.970
MEGAN KROH: I love
the color lilac.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:17.850
I'm obsessed with pastel colors.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.030
I think they're coming
back for spring.

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.930
I've seen it in stores,
but I love pastel colors.

00:26:23.930 --> 00:26:25.390
They just make me happy.

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:26.440
KANDEE JOHNSON: They're
soft [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.240
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
You have a nice palette

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.404
of pastel on today.

00:26:29.404 --> 00:26:30.820
MEGAN KROH: Like
I'm sick already.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.992
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And
today's a nicer day.

00:26:33.992 --> 00:26:35.950
KANDEE JOHNSON: We were
totally in [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.890
In sync.

00:26:40.890 --> 00:26:43.127
So pastels, do you have any--

00:26:43.127 --> 00:26:45.460
KANDEE JOHNSON: I think it's
hard, because trends always

00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:46.764
seem to circulate back around.

00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:48.430
I think it's hard to
say a makeup trend,

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:50.221
because some I'm like,
I'm not [INAUDIBLE],

00:26:50.221 --> 00:26:52.470
I don't care what editor
says well that's cool.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:53.780
That is not wearable.

00:26:53.780 --> 00:26:55.037
Like the Pantone Color.

00:26:55.037 --> 00:26:57.620
That's cool, but nobody's going
to go around in that lipstick.

00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:58.457
They're just--

00:26:58.457 --> 00:27:00.790
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's
an intense color right there.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.789
KANDEE JOHNSON: No one's
wearing that eyeshadow.

00:27:02.789 --> 00:27:05.004
So I think a smoky eye
is always so pretty.

00:27:05.004 --> 00:27:06.420
And then just like
a winged liner.

00:27:06.420 --> 00:27:07.490
It's timeless.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:10.060
You can look at it on
Marilyn Monroe in the '50s,

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:12.282
and she would look
just as amazing today.

00:27:12.282 --> 00:27:14.740
If you do too many trends, then
you're going to look like--

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.281
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Go classic, maybe

00:27:16.281 --> 00:27:17.510
keep the trends to a minimum.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.870
KANDEE JOHNSON: I think
matte lipcolor is fun.

00:27:18.870 --> 00:27:19.170
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Do
one trend at a time.

00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:22.057
KANDEE JOHNSON: Yeah,
one trend at a time.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:23.390
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I love that.

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:27.360
So speaking of like, sometimes
I know that you guys,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.400
brands will push a trend too.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.110
So do you guys
ever get approached

00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:34.630
by brands who are asking
you to do work with them,

00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:37.530
and it's really not a product
that you would endorse?

00:27:37.530 --> 00:27:39.400
How do you balance
your authenticity

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:42.322
with some of the brand
asks that come out?

00:27:42.322 --> 00:27:44.780
KANDEE JOHNSON: I think that's
the hard part about YouTube,

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.200
is I think a lot of
young YouTube girls

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.160
get into YouTube for
the wrong reason.

00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:52.900
I started because I wanted to
share my tips to help people.

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:54.490
I didn't start
YouTube to help me,

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:56.507
or to get YouTube famous
for things like that.

00:27:56.507 --> 00:27:58.340
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: You
probably didn't even

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.275
know that there
was such a thing.

00:28:00.275 --> 00:28:02.940
KANDEE JOHNSON: I didn't know
that could be a business.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.920
I just thought it
would be fun to do it.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:09.165
And I think that is probably
one of the one downfalls,

00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:11.040
it disappoints me a
little bit in that part--

00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:11.415
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
The commercialization?

00:28:11.415 --> 00:28:14.710
KANDEE JOHNSON: Because your
integrity needs to matter more.

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:16.780
I mean, people
offer you $1 all day

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:19.042
long to talk about
something, but it

00:28:19.042 --> 00:28:20.250
has to be something you like.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.390
And I just think a
lot of people need

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:25.980
a little bit of
coaching in that area.

00:28:25.980 --> 00:28:27.965
Like don't do this to
buy a new Chanel bag,

00:28:27.965 --> 00:28:29.590
because you just made
a bunch of money,

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:30.673
like do it to help people.

00:28:30.673 --> 00:28:34.260
And put your efforts in
a different area, what

00:28:34.260 --> 00:28:35.844
you value in different
areas, I think.

00:28:35.844 --> 00:28:37.718
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I
think that's the thing,

00:28:37.718 --> 00:28:39.820
because I work on
the brand side.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.190
Like I said, I help kind
of arrange these marriages.

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:44.710
But for me it really
is about the marriage,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:46.490
like making sure
it's the right fit

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:48.260
and making sure that
the brand is aligned,

00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:51.570
and ensuring too that you guys
have the creative control,

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:53.650
and that it still
feels like your voice.

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:57.210
Do you ever have to say no?

00:28:57.210 --> 00:29:00.080
Or have there been situations
where it's been a perfect fit,

00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.860
and you've been really
happy with the work

00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.730
that you've done with
the brand, in cases

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:05.234
where you have said yes?

00:29:05.234 --> 00:29:07.900
KANDEE JOHNSON: I think I say no
more than I would ever say yes.

00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:10.725
Because if you said
yes to all the deals,

00:29:10.725 --> 00:29:13.100
your channel would look like
a commercial for everything.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.610
And I think that's going to
be a problem in [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:17.250
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: You have
to protect your own brand too,

00:29:17.250 --> 00:29:17.751
right.

00:29:17.751 --> 00:29:19.166
KANDEE JOHNSON:
And a lot of times

00:29:19.166 --> 00:29:21.720
it's hard, because I get so
excited about makeup stuff,

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:22.410
I just love it.

00:29:22.410 --> 00:29:23.970
And so when I've
talked about things,

00:29:23.970 --> 00:29:25.470
people assume that
I paid, and I was

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:27.970
like you're assuming I get
paid because everybody else is

00:29:27.970 --> 00:29:29.150
doing stinking paid staff.

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.700
And I just think
this is awesome,

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.700
and I'm talking about it, and
now you guys think I'm paid.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:36.120
That irritates me to no end.

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.990
I'm like, no, I just
love it, I bought it,

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:39.730
I'll show you the
sticking receipt.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:43.640
It just makes me so angry.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.690
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: It
really has become, I think,

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.940
kind of a little bit
of a cluttered market,

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.430
and knowing that you're very
careful with the endorsements

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.210
that you do you
choose to go with,

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:56.667
and that it is about like
a natural connection,

00:29:56.667 --> 00:29:58.750
I think is really important
probably to your fans.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.724
They know that you're
not going to hawk so--

00:30:00.724 --> 00:30:02.140
KANDEE JOHNSON:
Something to them.

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:03.940
Or there is a group
of YouTubers talking.

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.580
They were all
talking about, they

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.790
were in a successful so
and so, blah, blah, blah,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.560
all these things.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.910
And after about 45
minutes of listening to it

00:30:10.910 --> 00:30:14.134
as I was cleaning up my
stuff, I just went over.

00:30:14.134 --> 00:30:15.050
I like, you know what?

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.840
Why did you guys start YouTube?

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:17.800
Why?

00:30:17.800 --> 00:30:19.760
And some of them
just openly admitted,

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.050
they're like, I did it so
I could get free stuff.

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.070
And I was like, (SIGHS).

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:25.501
I have nothing to tell you.

00:30:25.501 --> 00:30:27.250
That is the worst
reason to start YouTube.

00:30:27.250 --> 00:30:28.600
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: It's
not for the endgame.

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:30.690
KANDEE JOHNSON: Yeah
you should be almost

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:32.916
like I'm doing it to
entertain, to educate,

00:30:32.916 --> 00:30:33.790
to do something else.

00:30:33.790 --> 00:30:35.710
Not because, "I'm
going to be famous,

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:37.894
and I want to have a
designer bag, and--"

00:30:37.894 --> 00:30:38.810
that's not the reason.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:41.059
That shouldn't be your reason
why you started YouTube.

00:30:41.059 --> 00:30:43.740
KANDEE JOHNSON: Everybody
wants to be famous.

00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:45.130
OK so two more questions.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:48.440
The first one is, if
I weren't on YouTube,

00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:51.186
I would be doing blank.

00:30:51.186 --> 00:30:52.810
KANDEE JOHNSON: If
I wasn't on YouTube,

00:30:52.810 --> 00:30:54.684
I'd still probably be
hustling, doing makeup.

00:30:54.684 --> 00:30:57.350
Trying to get makeup
jobs, and then not getting

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:59.950
a job for three weeks, and
then five requests for one day,

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.450
and just be really good
at saving my money,

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.850
because I wouldn't know when
I was going to work next.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:07.040
KANDEE JOHNSON: I'd agree.

00:31:07.040 --> 00:31:09.190
I actually do hair and
makeup on the side,

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.069
because I have my
cosmetology license now,

00:31:11.069 --> 00:31:13.610
so that's what I would be doing,
but literally my entire life

00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:14.580
is YouTube, so.

00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:16.590
But I would still be
doing makeup and hair.

00:31:16.590 --> 00:31:18.220
Because that's just what I love.

00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:19.470
I wouldn't pick anything else.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.550
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: OK and
the last one's a fun one too.

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:24.420
If you were going on
"Survivor" and you

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.730
could take one item with
you, what would you take?

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:30.850
We talked about razors,
we'll just like,

00:31:30.850 --> 00:31:32.686
because apparently
you go on "Survivor"

00:31:32.686 --> 00:31:34.310
and the women all
have shaved armpits--

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.120
KANDEE JOHNSON: And legs--

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.070
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
--the whole time.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.890
KANDEE JOHNSON:
How do you do that?

00:31:36.890 --> 00:31:38.370
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I
thought this was "Survivor."

00:31:38.370 --> 00:31:39.300
KANDEE JOHNSON: You're supposed
to have a shell, and a tree

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:39.860
branch.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.610
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
What's going on here?

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:42.110
Anyway--

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:46.020
KANDEE JOHNSON: You
took a shower you liar.

00:31:46.020 --> 00:31:47.165
I'd go with concealer.

00:31:47.165 --> 00:31:48.790
MEGAN KROH: I would
say the same thing.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:50.540
I was totally going
to say the same thing.

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.130
Because, I don't know.

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:52.830
Yeah

00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:53.440
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
I just learned

00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.981
how to use a concealer brush,
you guys are probably thinking,

00:31:55.981 --> 00:31:59.200
she's such a nube.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.280
Because I went to Sephora
for this class, and it

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.930
was the flawless
foundation class.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:03.790
And they had like
these special--

00:32:03.790 --> 00:32:04.660
KANDEE JOHNSON: Did they not
give you the beauty blender

00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:05.530
sponge?

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:06.300
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: They didn't.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:07.000
They gave me the--

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:07.270
KANDEE JOHNSON: What?

00:32:07.270 --> 00:32:08.080
They're fired.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.020
Is that what I need to get?

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.640
OK I need the flawless face.

00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.022
The thing that
looks like a cone?

00:32:14.022 --> 00:32:15.480
KANDEE JOHNSON:
The pink egg thing.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.840
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's a ball, OK.

00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:17.604
MEGAN KROH: With a tip on it.

00:32:17.604 --> 00:32:18.370
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's what it looks like.

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:20.170
KANDEE JOHNSON: And make
sure you use it wet.

00:32:20.170 --> 00:32:20.616
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: OK.

00:32:20.616 --> 00:32:21.850
KANDEE JOHNSON: Damp.

00:32:21.850 --> 00:32:22.540
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Interesting.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.535
KANDEE JOHNSON: You
will look airbrushed.

00:32:23.535 --> 00:32:23.840
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Good to know.

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.860
OK, that's what I need.

00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:26.090
Especially with these lights.

00:32:28.791 --> 00:32:29.290
Cool.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:30.414
All right, so we've got it.

00:32:30.414 --> 00:32:32.990
Does anybody have questions?

00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:36.440
We're going to open it up for
like 15 minutes of questions.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.500
This is the time.

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.575
Flawless foundation questions,
how to get started on YouTube.

00:32:40.575 --> 00:32:41.320
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.970
Kandee I've been watching you
forever, I'm just such a fan.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:44.430
KANDEE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:45.400
Thanks so much.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:47.960
AUDIENCE: But you've shared
a lot of your personal life,

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:49.580
and the ups and downs.

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:55.020
How do you balance not sharing
too much, while also expressing

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.615
your true self to your fans?

00:32:56.615 --> 00:32:58.740
KANDEE JOHNSON: It's really
hard, because in a way,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:01.030
it feels like
everybody becomes so

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:02.820
much a source of
your friendship.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.250
It feels like, oh, I could
share whatever I want.

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:08.941
And then sometimes you
realize you can't do that.

00:33:08.941 --> 00:33:11.440
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: You have
to protect yourself too, right?

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.023
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well there's a
lot of crazies on the internet.

00:33:14.023 --> 00:33:15.976
Like I've had some
crazy stalkers.

00:33:15.976 --> 00:33:18.630
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:I think I
remember hearing that from you.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.524
KANDEE JOHNSON: There's been
some really crazy evil ones.

00:33:21.524 --> 00:33:23.690
Just things that you would
imagine like human beings

00:33:23.690 --> 00:33:24.190
would do.

00:33:24.190 --> 00:33:27.050
And so that's made me
a little more cautious

00:33:27.050 --> 00:33:30.280
of-- like you do have
to do strategic things.

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:33.210
Like when you're at a
location, like I will never

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:34.950
post what hotel I'm
at, I will never

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:38.900
post where I'm at immediately,
because crazy people have

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.410
shown up.

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:41.630
And they're not
like, hey I love you,

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:43.860
it's like, (GROWING)
I love you, and I've

00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:45.400
got a knife in my hand.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.750
And it's just like, very scary.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.650
So, there's just a
hard balance, and I

00:33:49.650 --> 00:33:53.206
think some people use social
media as like a diary almost.

00:33:53.206 --> 00:33:55.080
You can't do that,
because people would think

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.806
I'm schizophrenic if I was
like, I'm crying, and I'm sad.

00:33:59.806 --> 00:34:01.680
And then a couple hours
later I'm good again.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.305
And you're like, yay,
I love ice cream,

00:34:03.305 --> 00:34:06.060
and they're like, you were just
crying an hour ago on Twitter,

00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.384
what?

00:34:07.384 --> 00:34:08.800
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It's expounded

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.462
when you've got hundreds of
thousands, or millions of fans.

00:34:11.462 --> 00:34:12.670
KANDEE JOHNSON: This morning.

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:13.639
I tweeted a thing.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.159
I was just driving
by in New York.

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.159
And all these buildings.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:17.360
There's a lot of
people in the city.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:19.480
I can't believe there's
enough water for us all

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.507
to take a shower today.

00:34:20.507 --> 00:34:21.340
It was a dumb thing.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:23.830
Posted that on Facebook,
people went bananas.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:25.239
They're like, how dare you?

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.610
People don't have water
in some countries,

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.185
and you're talking
about a shower?

00:34:30.185 --> 00:34:32.989
And I was like, oh
my gosh, internet.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.780
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
It was just a comment.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.330
KANDEE JOHNSON: I
can't say anything.

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:37.080
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
What about you?

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.489
Do you kind of
feel like you have

00:34:38.489 --> 00:34:40.969
to kind of put a little
bit of a barrier up?

00:34:40.969 --> 00:34:41.880
Are you pretty--

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.713
MEGAN KROH: Oh yeah.

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:45.790
I've had some bad
times in the past.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:48.190
I was working at-- before
I started YouTube-- well

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.270
actually, kind of when
I started YouTube,

00:34:50.270 --> 00:34:52.973
I was working at a little place.

00:34:52.973 --> 00:34:54.639
And people knew where
I worked, and they

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:56.889
were sending letters to my work.

00:34:56.889 --> 00:34:58.980
And I didn't even know
about it, because my boss

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:00.230
kept the letters from me.

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:02.730
KANDEE JOHNSON: Letters to meet
you, or letters of meanness?

00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.219
MEGAN KROH: Letters to me.

00:35:04.219 --> 00:35:06.760
But I don't know what they said,
I never even looked at them.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:07.676
She kept them from me.

00:35:07.676 --> 00:35:11.870
But I realized that it was
my time to quit that job,

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:14.920
because it was just
getting too out of hand.

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.545
People recognized
where I was too--

00:35:16.545 --> 00:35:17.920
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Brought a lot

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.095
of business into
the store, probably.

00:35:20.095 --> 00:35:22.360
MEGAN KROH: Probably,
but when I do vlogs,

00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:25.240
like when I drive around
and do daily life videos,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.750
I have to watch where I
am, and what I'm showing,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:32.790
and so that's one thing that
I've learned over the years.

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:34.180
Be careful.

00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:36.750
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That is a direct side

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.800
effect of having
everything in real time,

00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.310
and posting so quickly around--

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:41.270
KANDEE JOHNSON: And
people care more about,

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:43.561
like a YouTuber feels like
a more intimate relationship

00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.220
than with a celebrity,
where people

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.070
may be afraid to
go up to celebrity.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.370
But we're more approachable.

00:35:48.370 --> 00:35:50.100
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Very
accessible compared to--

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:51.030
KANDEE JOHNSON: So it's
a little different.

00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:52.600
KANDEE JOHNSON: Where like if
Britney Spears is somewhere,

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.030
no one's going to bother her.

00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:57.430
Or they're going to
be like (YELLING).

00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:59.056
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Most people.

00:35:59.056 --> 00:36:00.430
KANDEE JOHNSON:
Which is awesome,

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:01.763
[INAUDIBLE] just the crazy ones.

00:36:01.763 --> 00:36:04.510
I'll take a hug all day long,
as long as it's not a crazy,

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:07.687
want to kill you
hug or something.

00:36:07.687 --> 00:36:09.270
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's a good time

00:36:09.270 --> 00:36:10.270
as for another question.

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.940
AUDIENCE: So hi, I'm Lena,
and I'm such a big fan.

00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:20.990
I know I told you this, I
got a little bit starstruck.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:24.686
I subscribe on my corporate
account, my personal account,

00:36:24.686 --> 00:36:27.684
you have multiple subscribers
from this [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:27.684 --> 00:36:28.816
KANDEE JOHNSON: Thank you.

00:36:28.816 --> 00:36:30.440
AUDIENCE: So my
question is, how do you

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.790
think of your long
term career goals?

00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:34.820
What are they?

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:37.740
I'm curious to hear
from both of you

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:39.720
how you think of
progressing your brand,

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:41.637
and your presence in YouTube.

00:36:41.637 --> 00:36:43.220
KANDEE JOHNSON: Oh,
that's a good one.

00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.630
Because YouTube
is so interesting.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.338
I mean, Justin Bieber
started on YouTube,

00:36:46.338 --> 00:36:48.903
but Biebs isn't still
drumming on YouTube.

00:36:48.903 --> 00:36:50.610
He went off to do things.

00:36:50.610 --> 00:36:53.530
So there's like so many
things that I want to do.

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.910
And then after you've done
a tutorial on everything,

00:36:55.910 --> 00:36:59.380
I'm like, how many more
contouring videos can I do?

00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:01.880
Like I've already done
one, and three, and four.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:07.320
So obviously, I would love
to do-- I want to do a book,

00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.430
really explaining
makeup for women,

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.814
like in a regular-- maybe
it has waterproof pages,

00:37:11.814 --> 00:37:13.230
you could take it
in the bathroom.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:13.940
I don't know.

00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.590
And then, I've always
wanted to do a makeup line,

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.420
and there's so many things
I want to go on to do,

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.767
that I mean, YouTube is amazing.

00:37:21.767 --> 00:37:23.600
Like it's the biggest
blessing, that I never

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.310
even knew to ask for.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:30.120
Because it's opened up-- I mean
Simon Cowell flew me to London

00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:31.054
to work with him.

00:37:31.054 --> 00:37:33.120
Like Simon Cowell, what?

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:36.170
That he knew that
I existed at all,

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:38.930
never would have happened
if it wasn't for YouTube.

00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.564
So it's so amazing, I
had no idea any of this

00:37:41.564 --> 00:37:43.980
would have ever happened when
I uploaded that first video,

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.680
you don't even see me in.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:47.317
I was like--

00:37:47.317 --> 00:37:48.900
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
And people see it.

00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:50.415
I've seen it like, five times.

00:37:50.415 --> 00:37:54.730
I'm like, wait, I've got to
make sure I'm doing this right.

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:55.910
What about you?

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:59.054
MEGAN KROH: I do want to
make my own makeup line.

00:37:59.054 --> 00:38:00.720
And I also want to
make my own hairline,

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:04.489
because I love big Jersey hair.

00:38:04.489 --> 00:38:06.530
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Your
hair is always gorgeous.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:09.300
MEGAN KROH: Thank you you.

00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.600
I don't care what anyone
says, I love my big hair.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.540
I love big hair.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:13.620
KANDEE JOHNSON: Big hair
never goes out of style.

00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:14.536
MEGAN KROH: I love it.

00:38:14.536 --> 00:38:18.080
And I love doing
my hair, so I feel

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.142
like a hair line would
be the best way to go.

00:38:20.142 --> 00:38:22.100
And I've thought about
doing a makeup line too,

00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:25.904
but that's what I
would love to do.

00:38:25.904 --> 00:38:27.320
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
I think you're

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:31.280
seeing a lot of businesses that
are growing outside of YouTube,

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.781
beyond YouTube, with
so many people who

00:38:33.781 --> 00:38:34.780
started on the platform.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.410
And I love the idea of books.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:38.890
I think that's such an
interesting area that

00:38:38.890 --> 00:38:40.760
is a little bit untapped.

00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:41.970
You could even do an ebook.

00:38:41.970 --> 00:38:43.670
You could do an
electronic book that you

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:46.000
could take in the bathroom,
and have your tablet.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.583
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well
videos are great,

00:38:47.583 --> 00:38:49.990
but sometimes you just
need-- like I just

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:52.090
need to look at a picture,
and read some steps.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:55.810
I don't want to skim through
something a million times.

00:38:55.810 --> 00:38:57.410
It's just maybe a lost art.

00:38:57.410 --> 00:38:59.500
Like a book, a real page, weird.

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.159
It's kind of nice.

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:03.200
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Anybody
else have a question?

00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:03.741
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:03.741 --> 00:39:06.750
First I want to say,
Kandee I love your message

00:39:06.750 --> 00:39:09.980
about inner beauty, I thought
it was very inspirational,

00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:12.500
but on top of the
external beauty,

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:13.950
I love both of your looks today.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:17.357
So are these looks
that are specific looks

00:39:17.357 --> 00:39:18.440
that are on your channels?

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.790
Or can you tell us
a little bit more

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.510
about the looks that
you went for today,

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.802
and what products you're
using, and what you did today?

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:26.259
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: We're going
to do a real time tutorial.

00:39:26.259 --> 00:39:28.808
KANDEE JOHNSON: I'm going
to wash half of my face off,

00:39:28.808 --> 00:39:31.930
and to the side.

00:39:31.930 --> 00:39:34.620
Today, well, is a little fancy.

00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:39.280
But I went crazy, and I
bought the YSL foundation,

00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:40.570
and it's kind of like magic.

00:39:40.570 --> 00:39:42.799
Like, you could have a
baby wipe on your face,

00:39:42.799 --> 00:39:44.674
and you're like, you're
a makeup artist baby,

00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:46.800
it just looks good.

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:48.140
It is so great.

00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.370
And then I have
Cover FX concealer,

00:39:50.370 --> 00:39:52.150
because if it can
hide a tattoo, it

00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:54.480
is going to cover
any redness, or rings

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.890
anywhere up in this area.

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.600
And then, this just
all lots of lip liners.

00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:02.430
Because they won't come off.

00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:05.710
I think it's like,
"Embrace Me," from Mac.

00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:07.502
Which I hope it's not
a discontinued thing,

00:40:07.502 --> 00:40:09.210
that drives me nuts
when they to do that.

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:10.890
That and then I just
put a blush on top,

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:13.882
and it will make it matte,
and then it will last.

00:40:13.882 --> 00:40:15.840
It almost lasted through
me eating my sandwich.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:18.980
I think a little came off.

00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:20.790
And then I just did
a black winged liner,

00:40:20.790 --> 00:40:21.980
because that the fastest thing.

00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:23.385
When you're in a
hurry, smokey eye

00:40:23.385 --> 00:40:24.960
will take you too long,
blending for days.

00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:27.126
I'm like, I don't have the
time for you, smokey eye.

00:40:27.126 --> 00:40:29.440
You're just getting
a wing, and mascaras.

00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:33.530
And then, I feel like
I'm so fancy today,

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:35.500
because I have the
Flutter lashes--

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.820
MEGAN KROH: There's
so many pretty.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.390
KANDEE JOHNSON: They're amazing.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:42.040
They're like $39.00 That
was the great [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.640
MEGAN KROH: What's
the brand of that?

00:40:43.640 --> 00:40:44.830
KANDEE JOHNSON: They
just called Flutter.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:46.590
MEGAN KROH: Oh, they're
just called Flutter.

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:47.520
I thought it was in a style.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.061
KANDEE JOHNSON: The
Kim, or the Roxy.

00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:51.170
I can't remember, but
they're like $39.00.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.930
But you can wear
them for many times.

00:40:54.930 --> 00:40:56.479
Just wash them.

00:40:56.479 --> 00:40:57.270
MEGAN KROH: I know.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:40:58.730
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's one
though that I still can't get.

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:01.349
I've watched your application
video a million times.

00:41:01.349 --> 00:41:02.640
I'm like, how does she do that?

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.450
KANDEE JOHNSON: Do
the demi wispies.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:05.675
You cut-- when the
eyelash is curved--

00:41:05.675 --> 00:41:06.725
cut that whole front off.

00:41:06.725 --> 00:41:08.725
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: And
just do it on the sides?

00:41:08.725 --> 00:41:11.058
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well because
when you have a full strip,

00:41:11.058 --> 00:41:13.916
it can look a
little stripper-ey.

00:41:13.916 --> 00:41:15.770
Just to be honest.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:18.460
But if you just do the demi
wispy on the outer part,

00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:21.415
it doesn't look natural, but
it looks less stripper-ey.

00:41:21.415 --> 00:41:23.040
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Well as long as you

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.720
get it on there straight, too.

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.760
KANDEE JOHNSON: I'm
like, half stripper.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:28.760
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I
wipe my eyes all the time,

00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:29.640
I'm scared it's
going to come off.

00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:31.450
KANDEE JOHNSON: And it feels
like a seashell's on your eye.

00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:32.950
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's true, you

00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:36.260
have to use the
sensation of wearing it.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:37.940
I know that you also
have a video now,

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:40.190
with your new hair color.

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:42.670
KANDEE JOHNSON: Only a couple.

00:41:42.670 --> 00:41:45.250
And I've seen a lot of hair
tutorials on your channel too.

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:46.820
MEGAN KROH: I'm
trying to do more.

00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:48.237
I've got a lot of looks coming.

00:41:48.237 --> 00:41:50.070
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well
hair is hard for people

00:41:50.070 --> 00:41:51.486
too, because it's
again, something

00:41:51.486 --> 00:41:53.149
that you don't learn how to do.

00:41:53.149 --> 00:41:55.690
Like you don't naturally-- like
I know how to do beach waves.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:59.630
It just doesn't come with
the curling iron you buy,

00:41:59.630 --> 00:42:00.505
or flat iron you buy.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.110
MEGAN KROH: Actually,
my look is the same

00:42:05.110 --> 00:42:06.450
as that picture over there.

00:42:06.450 --> 00:42:08.820
It's from my Valentine's
Day makeup look.

00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.480
I've kind of been doing it every
day, I've been addicted to it,

00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:15.500
using that chocolate bar
palette from Too Faced, two

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.060
actually smells like chocolate.

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:18.400
KANDEE JOHNSON: That is so
crazy that they do that.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.010
MEGAN KROH: It's incredible.

00:42:20.010 --> 00:42:23.470
So that's what I've been
obsessively with lately.

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.389
I mean I kind of went
a little full coverage,

00:42:26.389 --> 00:42:27.930
I wanted to look
good for the camera.

00:42:27.930 --> 00:42:29.940
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Your
lip gloss is beautiful.

00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:32.680
Is that in the same palette?

00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:34.410
MEGAN KROH: I'm
wearing the NYX butter

00:42:34.410 --> 00:42:37.744
gloss, one of the new
ones, in fortune cookie.

00:42:37.744 --> 00:42:40.160
KANDEE JOHNSON:It's just guru
makeup is named after edible

00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.770
things.

00:42:40.770 --> 00:42:41.686
MEGAN KROH: I love it.

00:42:41.686 --> 00:42:44.349
KANDEE JOHNSON: Smells like
chocolate, tastes like cookies.

00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:46.515
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Anybody
else have any questions?

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.969
AUDIENCE: So hey guys, I've
learned most of my makeup

00:42:54.969 --> 00:42:55.510
from you two.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:57.610
So thank you guys
for what you do.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:43:00.350
It has saved me so many times.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:02.540
But I noticed that
the more I start

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:06.010
to experiment with makeup, I've
kind of found this attitude of,

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:08.360
well there's the
guys who are like,

00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:10.110
well I prefer my
women without makeup.

00:43:10.110 --> 00:43:12.110
And then there's the women
who are kind of like,

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.285
well I don't wear any makeup,
so that makes me more special.

00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:19.070
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
The're an elitist quality

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.600
of the makeup-less woman.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:22.100
AUDIENCE: There's
kind of this like,

00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:24.430
well you're lying
because you wear makeup

00:43:24.430 --> 00:43:25.789
on your face kind of attitude.

00:43:25.789 --> 00:43:27.580
Or it's just because
you think you're ugly,

00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:28.160
and you're not ugly.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:29.659
Why do you feel the
need to wear it?

00:43:29.659 --> 00:43:32.069
And I keep trying to
explain to people that it's

00:43:32.069 --> 00:43:34.360
more I just like to do it,
and I like the way it looks.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.020
So how do you guys
respond, when you

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:39.410
get those people who talk
about, you guys aren't real,

00:43:39.410 --> 00:43:41.990
because you're hiding
what nature gave you.

00:43:41.990 --> 00:43:45.630
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:Or like
that superficial argument.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:47.840
KANDEE JOHNSON: I just
reply with the same thing.

00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:50.359
It's an art form, it's
a creative outlet.

00:43:50.359 --> 00:43:52.150
Instead of a canvas,
you draw on your face.

00:43:52.150 --> 00:43:53.630
And it's something that
you change everyday.

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:56.070
I'm not like, I can't leave
unless I contour my nose

00:43:56.070 --> 00:43:57.311
to make it look different.

00:43:57.311 --> 00:43:59.310
I'll do a wing up, I'll
put dots on my eyebrows.

00:43:59.310 --> 00:43:59.851
I don't care.

00:43:59.851 --> 00:44:01.385
It's like when you get dressed.

00:44:01.385 --> 00:44:03.010
I'm not going to go
around and be like,

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:05.730
I am naked, because I'm not
covering up with clothes today.

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:07.460
I'm not going to do that.

00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:08.630
It's just your style.

00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:10.430
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's a
really good argument, actually.

00:44:10.430 --> 00:44:11.680
Well I don't walk around
with no clothes on.

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:12.690
KANDEE JOHNSON:
It's the same thing.

00:44:12.690 --> 00:44:14.582
It's a way of
expressing your style.

00:44:14.582 --> 00:44:16.290
Like I have friends
that are more pin-up.

00:44:16.290 --> 00:44:18.010
They're more rockabilly.

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.545
And it reflects in
their makeup too.

00:44:20.545 --> 00:44:22.670
And when I was younger, my
boyfriend would be like,

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:24.575
I love it that you
don't wear any makeup.

00:44:24.575 --> 00:44:26.158
And I was like,
(SNICKERS), I totally

00:44:26.158 --> 00:44:27.640
have mascara, and foundation,
and concealer, and powder

00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:29.890
underneath, and you
don't even know.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.490
Guys don't even know, really.

00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:34.740
You're kind of safe that way.

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:40.550
MEGAN KROH: I would say
that if I wear makeup

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.630
because I love it,
and I feel confident.

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:45.520
It makes me feel
confident everyday.

00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:50.700
I do struggle with acne
issues, and a lot of people

00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.470
have said to me, I
can't believe that you

00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:54.155
go on YouTube with no makeup on.

00:44:54.155 --> 00:44:56.030
I can't believe you show
your face like that.

00:44:56.030 --> 00:44:59.100
And sometimes it gets me down,
but the reason why I do it,

00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:02.320
is because I want people to
know how to cover this up.

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:05.040
How to feel beautiful
with makeup on.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.750
Because it makes
me feel confident,

00:45:06.750 --> 00:45:10.400
and people actually have
searched how to cover up acne,

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:13.500
how do get a flawless,
full coverage face.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.157
And I love it on myself.

00:45:15.157 --> 00:45:17.490
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I think
that's really inspiring too,

00:45:17.490 --> 00:45:17.989
actually.

00:45:17.989 --> 00:45:21.580
Because I think a lot
of us see the images,

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.860
the airbrushed
images in magazines.

00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:28.000
And you never think of Julia
Roberts as having dark spots,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.770
or acne underneath her makeup.

00:45:29.770 --> 00:45:33.500
And it's really inspiring to see
women where you see the after,

00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:35.860
and you guys both
look beautiful.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:38.470
I just learned how
to cover up my zits,

00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:40.730
so hopefully they're
not all showing.

00:45:40.730 --> 00:45:44.310
It's just nice to have, to
see that as a role model.

00:45:44.310 --> 00:45:47.190
Especially for young girls
that are going through puberty,

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:49.760
and a time in their life
where they're breaking out,

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.810
to see that it's not all the
Julia Roberts airbrushed stuff.

00:45:53.810 --> 00:45:56.010
That you kind of have
to go through a process

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:56.940
to get to that.

00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:58.900
You don't just wake up in the
morning just looking like that.

00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.150
KANDEE JOHNSON: Both sides OK.

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:02.270
I start my video off
without any makeup on.

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:04.042
People-- I always
go to the store,

00:46:04.042 --> 00:46:06.333
and I don't have makeup on,
and somebody recognizes me,

00:46:06.333 --> 00:46:08.292
I'm like, how did
you know it was me?

00:46:08.292 --> 00:46:09.750
They're like, you
don't have makeup

00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:11.208
on in the beginning
of your videos.

00:46:11.208 --> 00:46:13.400
I'm like, oh yeah,
I forgot about that.

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:14.190
Why do I do this?

00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:14.898
This is so weird.

00:46:14.898 --> 00:46:18.130
But when you can see that I'm
OK with makeup on, it's fun,

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:19.300
and I'm OK without it.

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:21.800
And usually when you look
beautiful, and you're like,

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:22.680
I could see anybody.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.060
And then you see no one, and
then you have no makeup on,

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.360
and you see ex boyfriends,
and all kinds of things.

00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:27.820
You're like cool.

00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:28.300
Today?

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:28.800
Great.

00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:29.420
This is great.

00:46:32.014 --> 00:46:33.680
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
You have a question?

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:34.040
AUDIENCE: Hi guys.

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.170
Thank you for coming to Google.

00:46:35.170 --> 00:46:36.920
KANDEE JOHNSON: Thanks
for having us here.

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.160
AUDIENCE: We love it.

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.430
So I have a couple questions.

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:41.340
The first is, at
what point did you

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:45.190
decide that you wanted to make
YouTube your full time job?

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:47.070
What was that day where
you were like, OK.

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:49.380
I'm going to do this,
and quit my other stuff

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.420
that I might be doing.

00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:54.120
And then two, well I'll
ask the second one after,

00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:55.220
if you don't mind.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.405
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Number one.

00:46:57.405 --> 00:47:01.910
KANDEE JOHNSON: That was when
YouTube became so-- for me, I

00:47:01.910 --> 00:47:04.950
had a blog also, so it was
my blog, and my YouTube,

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:08.860
were taking up so
much time to do.

00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.510
And then when I
realized, oh, you

00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.410
can actually make
a living from this,

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.540
or from speaking at
events, or things

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.474
YouTube opened other
doors for, and that I

00:47:17.474 --> 00:47:18.890
was making the
same amount as when

00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:21.660
I was like trying to kill
myself getting a makeup job.

00:47:21.660 --> 00:47:25.390
And I was like, hey, I'm working
harder, and longer hours than I

00:47:25.390 --> 00:47:27.320
ever have, but I'm
making the same money,

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:28.800
and I don't have
to leave my house.

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:31.006
So I'll just do this.

00:47:31.006 --> 00:47:33.130
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Was
there a tipping point video

00:47:33.130 --> 00:47:34.260
for either of you?

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.430
Where it was just like you got
a ton of views on one video?

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:41.274
Or was it more like
a gradual process?

00:47:41.274 --> 00:47:42.690
MEGAN KROH: I don't
think for me--

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:46.340
I don't know one of my videos
that really had a ton of views.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.560
I can't really think of one.

00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.974
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: It just
kind of evolved gradually.

00:47:49.974 --> 00:47:51.140
MEGAN KROH: Yeah, gradually.

00:47:51.140 --> 00:47:52.960
KANDEE JOHNSON: I don't
think anything catapulted me.

00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.350
I mean there was the YouTube
homepage, which I really

00:47:55.350 --> 00:47:56.820
loved when there
was the home page.

00:47:56.820 --> 00:47:59.195
Because that was like, when
you made it on the home page,

00:47:59.195 --> 00:48:00.069
you're like, (GRUNTS)

00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:01.670
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Emotional.

00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:02.590
Make it rain.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:03.715
KANDEE JOHNSON: Hallelujah.

00:48:03.715 --> 00:48:04.604
Make it rain.

00:48:04.604 --> 00:48:07.590
And again, I would only know
because I would get the most

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.131
evil comments ever when I
made it onto the homepage.

00:48:10.131 --> 00:48:11.880
I'd just go to my
video, and it'd be like,

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.834
you suck, you should
die, you're so ugly,

00:48:13.834 --> 00:48:15.750
you look like a man--
made it on the homepage!

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.192
So excited.

00:48:17.192 --> 00:48:18.030
It was great.

00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:19.410
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: That's
all the 13-year-old boys

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:20.720
that accidentally clicked in.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.470
KANDEE JOHNSON: Oh
yeah, I'm like, thanks.

00:48:22.470 --> 00:48:24.553
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: So did
you have a moment where

00:48:24.553 --> 00:48:27.162
you realized-- outside
of the gradual process,

00:48:27.162 --> 00:48:28.870
was there a moment
where you're like, OK,

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.860
I can do this full time now.

00:48:30.860 --> 00:48:32.950
MEGAN KROH: I think
it was sort of when

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:36.770
I quit my other job that
I was talking about.

00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:39.700
I realized that I was getting
a lot of positive feedback,

00:48:39.700 --> 00:48:41.590
and a lot of people
were requesting things,

00:48:41.590 --> 00:48:42.965
and I just realized
I was getting

00:48:42.965 --> 00:48:44.620
a lot more views than expected.

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:47.530
I started this out as a
hobby, it was just a hobby.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.790
I didn't even know you could
make money from it, at all.

00:48:50.790 --> 00:48:52.894
The first time I realized
was when I got an email,

00:48:52.894 --> 00:48:54.935
and they don't have this
now, because it changed.

00:48:54.935 --> 00:48:58.370
But I got the email that I
was accepted for the YouTube

00:48:58.370 --> 00:49:00.610
partnership.

00:49:00.610 --> 00:49:01.800
The partner program.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:02.540
I was amazed.

00:49:02.540 --> 00:49:05.614
I was like, oh my gosh, I
can be a YouTube partner.

00:49:05.614 --> 00:49:08.030
KANDEE JOHNSON: I didn't even
know you made money, either.

00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.450
I just thought you had to make a
video longer than ten minutes--

00:49:10.450 --> 00:49:11.287
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: I
think a lot of people

00:49:11.287 --> 00:49:12.270
don't realize that.

00:49:12.270 --> 00:49:13.424
KANDEE JOHNSON:
--Post up a thumbnail,

00:49:13.424 --> 00:49:14.560
and an eleven minute video?

00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.500
Yes.

00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:18.309
MEGAN KROH: I was most excited
with when you became a YouTube

00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:20.600
partner you could have a
banner, and you could do this,

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:21.840
and you could do that,
and you could decorate,

00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.306
and I was so excited for that.

00:49:23.306 --> 00:49:24.930
I didn't even know
about anything else.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:27.346
KANDEE JOHNSON: I just wanted
the longer than ten minutes.

00:49:27.346 --> 00:49:29.940
Because I'm like, how do
they get those twenty--

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:32.110
like twenty-seven minute video?

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:34.296
Oh, what I could
talk-- I couldn't even

00:49:34.296 --> 00:49:36.250
make them that long.

00:49:36.250 --> 00:49:36.980
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: You
had another question too,

00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:37.540
didn't you?

00:49:37.540 --> 00:49:39.373
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so then
another question is,

00:49:39.373 --> 00:49:41.610
even though you're-- we
won't say the word "gurus,"

00:49:41.610 --> 00:49:44.690
we'll say experts
for makeup and hair,

00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:48.660
what brands who want to have
you maybe come and do a video

00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.250
that's more lifestyle oriented?

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:57.260
That's not about your genre per
se, but more of you as a brand,

00:49:57.260 --> 00:50:01.820
to talk about a family, or
just spring time, their summer

00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:04.140
vacations, or whatever
topics that brands

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:06.010
might want to align with?

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:07.190
I'm curious about that.

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.330
Are you open to being
employed more in the lifestyle

00:50:11.330 --> 00:50:14.740
way from a brand, instead of
always about your expertise

00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:15.241
area?

00:50:15.241 --> 00:50:17.698
KANDEE JOHNSON: Well I think
it's interesting, because once

00:50:17.698 --> 00:50:20.260
you start on YouTube, I mean I
started so much about beauty.

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.340
But then people are like, oh
how do you make those cupcakes?

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:23.210
How'd you make your shirt?

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:23.850
Did you make your bracelet?

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:24.400
Where do you eat?

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.140
How do you workout?

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:27.014
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: What
Christmas gifts do you get?

00:50:27.014 --> 00:50:28.370
KANDEE JOHNSON: How
do you wrap presents?

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.036
It became so much
more than just beauty,

00:50:30.036 --> 00:50:32.680
which really amazed me at first.

00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:37.110
And then, I just got to do
a commercial with Quaker

00:50:37.110 --> 00:50:37.780
through YouTube.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:40.630
And it was awesome,
because I mean,

00:50:40.630 --> 00:50:42.290
I never felt like
a celebrity person,

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.992
and there was a star on the
trailer with my name on it.

00:50:44.992 --> 00:50:46.450
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
That's awesome.

00:50:46.450 --> 00:50:47.380
KANDEE JOHNSON: And I was
like, and I don't have to film

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:48.460
or edit this?

00:50:48.460 --> 00:50:49.655
I will do these every day.

00:50:49.655 --> 00:50:52.320
This is so great.

00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.990
And the oatmeal
tasted, good because we

00:50:53.990 --> 00:50:54.730
had to keep eating it.

00:50:54.730 --> 00:50:56.915
I'm like, thank goodness,
because if this was bad.

00:50:59.810 --> 00:51:02.930
MEGAN KROH: I would say, since
I do have a vlog channel,

00:51:02.930 --> 00:51:04.510
I mean that is my life.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:09.320
I share my life, and what
goes on in my daily routine.

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.760
I share my family, so I
would say I'm open to it.

00:51:12.760 --> 00:51:15.060
I share not just my
beauty advice, and tips,

00:51:15.060 --> 00:51:17.290
but I also do share my life.

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.600
KANDEE JOHNSON: You
both have vlog channels.

00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.100
Yours is--

00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:21.100
KANDEE JOHNSON: I don't.

00:51:21.100 --> 00:51:23.770
Kandeeland, which
I don't do a daily.

00:51:23.770 --> 00:51:26.430
I don't know how
people do a daily.

00:51:26.430 --> 00:51:28.920
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: A daily
video on a second channel.

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:30.920
MEGAN KROH: I'm not up
to that daily [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:32.270
KANDEE JOHNSON: I can't.

00:51:32.270 --> 00:51:34.950
The Shaytards amaze me.

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:35.770
They just amaze me.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:37.210
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: But
they have help, too.

00:51:37.210 --> 00:51:37.900
They have people

00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:38.550
KANDEE JOHNSON:
And he's editing.

00:51:38.550 --> 00:51:40.350
We worked on something,
and in the breaks

00:51:40.350 --> 00:51:42.300
when we weren't filming,
he's sitting on set.

00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.780
always for the camera, editing.

00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.880
And he'd hide his computer, it's
just amazing how they do that.

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.182
I was like, I would
just blow up if I

00:51:50.182 --> 00:51:51.890
had to edit one
more minute a day.

00:51:53.492 --> 00:51:54.950
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
I think we have

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:57.390
time for one more question.

00:51:57.390 --> 00:52:00.740
Anybody have the last question?

00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:03.110
AUDIENCE: Why not have
someone help with editing?

00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:04.610
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
The question is,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:08.240
why not have someone
help with editing?

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.700
And I think a lot
of folks now, when

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.410
you get to a critical point
where it is a full time job,

00:52:13.410 --> 00:52:17.290
a lot of people do hire you
know, a crew, or editors

00:52:17.290 --> 00:52:20.530
or-- you guys are part
of the Maker network.

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:22.870
I don't know if you guys get
production help from them,

00:52:22.870 --> 00:52:24.255
or if that's part of the--

00:52:24.255 --> 00:52:25.630
KANDEE JOHNSON:
I think everybody

00:52:25.630 --> 00:52:27.250
has different deals
with them, and I

00:52:27.250 --> 00:52:29.900
think it's hard because a
tutorial, it's really hard.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.330
Because how I film, I
don't think an editor

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.050
would know what
needed to be in there,

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:36.490
and I'd still have to go
in, and be like, no, no, no.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:38.020
Show that a couple
seconds longer,

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:41.370
because the voice
over's got to be longer.

00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:42.450
I think it's just hard.

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:44.130
And then when-- I don't know.

00:52:44.130 --> 00:52:45.112
Like I edit weird.

00:52:45.112 --> 00:52:47.070
I don't think I have the
most, like they're not

00:52:47.070 --> 00:52:49.480
the most smooth,
professional videos.

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.400
I just funny things
in, or weird stuff.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:52.900
And I think that's
what people like.

00:52:52.900 --> 00:52:56.380
And if it wasn't that, if it
wasn't my fingerprint on it,

00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:59.660
it would be not my voice.

00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.930
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
I totally hear that.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:05.570
MEGAN KROH: I feel like it's--
I'm very picky with editing.

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:06.800
It has to go my way.

00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:07.970
And I don't know.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:09.250
I just feel very picky.

00:53:09.250 --> 00:53:12.040
It's about-- well I
guess, it's about adding

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.640
your personal touch it.

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:16.772
The music you want, anything.

00:53:16.772 --> 00:53:18.730
KANDEE JOHNSON: And I
think the more individual

00:53:18.730 --> 00:53:22.700
you are as a person, the more
people know that that's you.

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.180
Where other people,
they wouldn't

00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:26.710
know, because it's not so
much their personality coming

00:53:26.710 --> 00:53:26.920
through.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.295
But they would
know that it's not

00:53:28.295 --> 00:53:29.615
one of my weird, quirky videos.

00:53:29.615 --> 00:53:31.490
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Part
of it too, I'm sure,

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:33.830
it's like you guys started
doing this yourselves,

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:36.620
you've been doing it for
a long time, yourself.

00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:38.180
And to kind of
hand that off, it's

00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.730
like kind of handing
over your baby.

00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:42.010
KANDEE JOHNSON: It is, you're
like, no I can't do it.

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.880
I would like help,
but I don't want it.

00:53:43.880 --> 00:53:45.089
MEGAN KROH: It's really hard.

00:53:45.089 --> 00:53:47.504
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Like I
need help, but I'm always busy.

00:53:47.504 --> 00:53:49.520
KANDEE JOHNSON: But I
don't want your help.

00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.260
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Any
last words of advice?

00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:55.190
Something on your mind?

00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:58.220
Trends, interesting stuff
that you're looking at?

00:53:58.220 --> 00:54:02.020
Something you want to
impart to us here at Google?

00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:03.720
KANDEE JOHNSON: I love Google.

00:54:03.720 --> 00:54:05.460
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: You should
come visit us more often.

00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:05.890
KANDEE JOHNSON: If
it wasn't for Google,

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:08.520
I wouldn't be doing any
of this awesome stuff.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.550
MEGAN KROH: Oh my gosh, me too.

00:54:10.550 --> 00:54:13.440
KANDEE JOHNSON: I have this
shirt, I think it's awesome,

00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:15.671
but it says the like,
"As seen on TV,"

00:54:15.671 --> 00:54:16.920
but it's "As seen on YouTube."

00:54:16.920 --> 00:54:18.400
It's my favorite shirt.

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:21.300
And I didn't ever think
it's a weird shirt

00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.850
until you wear it out somewhere.

00:54:22.850 --> 00:54:24.760
And then somebody will ask
about it, and they're like,

00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:25.843
(DEEP VOICE) That's funny.

00:54:25.843 --> 00:54:26.820
Where'd you buy that?

00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.260
And I was like, well,
YouTube sent it to me.

00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:31.620
And then it kind of begins
a whole weird conversation.

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.703
(DEEP VOICE) Well, like
why would YouTube send it?

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:36.926
Well I do tutorials
videos YouTube.

00:54:36.926 --> 00:54:37.840
It's so awkward.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:38.736
(DEEP VOICE) What do you do?

00:54:38.736 --> 00:54:39.235
On YouTube?

00:54:39.235 --> 00:54:39.990
You make money?

00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:41.240
Is that what you do for a job?

00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.315
It starts too many questions,
I'm like, I clean houses.

00:54:45.315 --> 00:54:50.260
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Let's just
go rewind this conversation.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.150
Cool.

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:52.067
Any last words?

00:54:52.067 --> 00:54:53.650
MEGAN KROH: I can't
think of anything.

00:54:53.650 --> 00:54:54.200
I really can't.

00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:55.616
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
Well thank you

00:54:55.616 --> 00:54:59.220
guys for coming, and sharing
your stories with us.

00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:02.370
This is a departure from
some of the other talks

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:03.300
that we usually have.

00:55:03.300 --> 00:55:04.258
KANDEE JOHNSON: Really?

00:55:04.258 --> 00:55:06.270
STEPHANIE WENDELIN:
So it's nice to have

00:55:06.270 --> 00:55:09.180
a little bit of nerd out
on the beauty category.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:11.430
KANDEE JOHNSON: A little
beauty geek out, [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.610
STEPHANIE WENDELIN: Geek out.

00:55:12.610 --> 00:55:13.950
We're geeking out
on beauty today.

00:55:13.950 --> 00:55:14.449
Cool.

00:55:14.449 --> 00:55:16.420
Well thank you.
