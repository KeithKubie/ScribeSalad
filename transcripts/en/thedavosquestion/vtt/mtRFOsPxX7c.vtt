&gt;&gt; Hi, YouTube.
My name is Kristin Halvorsen.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.750
I'm the Finance Minister of Norway and I think
the most important

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.510
thing that we can do is to take the global
warming seriously and we

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.680
have to do that as individuals but especially
we that are responsible

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:28.070
for the financial policy should, uh, know
that climate change is

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:33.960
more -- the most important thing for the future's
economy.
