00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.520
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: So, I'm Derrick Alfred (ph) from
the New York Times. I'm a Software Architect

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:18.460
there. And we use Google on a number of places.
We've used the Maps API for our real estate

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.300
and travel sections. We've used CSE to power
our site search. We've also more recently

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.470
used some of the data APIs around portable
contacts to do a social graph import for our

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.420
TimesPeople application.
&gt;&gt; So, you chose to use the Google APIs, the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.219
AJAX APIs, tell us a bit about how you came
to this decision.

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.660
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: So, one of the reasons we wanted
to use the Google APIs is user familiarity.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.710
So, people are really used to the Google Maps
experience. They know the look and feel. Has

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.100
wide adoption. So, it's a comfortable fit
for our users. It has great coverage and it

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.630
is easy to work with, so we've been able to
do a lot of interesting overlays that really

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.200
complement the data and the journalism that
we do on top of it.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.329
&gt;&gt; So, as developers, we really value being
able to share war stories and lessons, technical

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:22.680
challenges, tell us about one particularly
difficult period of development phase on how

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.750
you approached the technical challenge.
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: So, recently, we have a social

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.160
layer that puts on top of nytimes.com called
TimesPeople. And one of our challenges has

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:43.479
been importing social graph and so we've used
the Google Contacts API and the newer implementation

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.479
of portable contacts. So, I think the real
difficulty for us has been or the challenge

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.570
has been the kind of evolving standard around
that and so we were really excited to see

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.969
Google adopt portable contacts. And so, luckily
for us, we actually just--we didn't operate

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.399
fast enough but the way we solve some of our
technical problems is that we waited long

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.939
enough for Google to embrace the standard
and allow us to reuse some existing code that

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:14.850
we already had, so that was really exciting
for us.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.150
&gt;&gt; So, what are some of the benefits to your
app of using the APIs?

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.450
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: So, I think our TimesPeople social
application really benefits from using portable

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:33.000
contacts and since that Google Contacts and
Gmail have such a wide adoption, it enables

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.620
people to get up on our TimesPeople social
layer much easier. So, by importing those

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.640
friends, we're able to start using TimesPeople
and be a lot more productive from the get-go.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.280
&gt;&gt; Has using the APIs reduced the amount of
work for you?

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.690
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: I think definitely using the APIs
has reduced the amount of work. In some ways

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.950
it's not just reduced the amount of work but
it's made things possible where it might not

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.909
have been possible otherwise. So, if there's
certain things that we, you know, might not

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.120
have--ever have done in terms of our real
estate and showing maps and where things are

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.420
and putting the overlays on that--without
something like Google Maps, I'm not sure how

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.560
we would have done it.
&gt;&gt; What kinds of features of were made possible

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:34.739
by having access to produce APIs?
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: So, some of the interesting features

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:41.049
we've done with Google Maps around our travel
and destination sites, we're able to kind

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.330
of plot a lot more stuff and show the same
content that we have kind of in a list or

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.209
tabular form actually laid out geographically
and it really enables--users get a sense of

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.569
how to start to plan their trips and think
about the places they're going to visit. So,

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.370
it's really greatly and rich start travel
site.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.989
&gt;&gt; What are some of the features you're planning
to implement to your application?

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.239
&gt;&gt; ALFRED: Well, we continue to look at all
the Google APIs as they come out and trying

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:14.939
to figure out which ones we can leverage to
take advantage of. And so, I think, things

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:22.540
that are around the social--open social stuff
are really interesting and as we see some

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.260
of the more advanced features around CSE coming
on board with the customized search, I think

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.510
there is great potential for us to kind of
leverage some of the newer stuff there as

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.730
well.
