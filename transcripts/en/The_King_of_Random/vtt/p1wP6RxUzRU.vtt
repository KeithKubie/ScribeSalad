00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.300
What's up guys welcome back to another epic day of experimenting!

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.920
Today I'm with MatPat and we both have gas you know
MatPat what is going on today

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.420
So today we are doing some experiment with
sulfur hexafluoride or as we call it SF6

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.619
not be confused with Street Fighter 6
all you videogame fans out there

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
That's right today we're answering a comment
request from GD Nilo932 who says

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.019
"Do something with sulfur hexafluoride
plz" so MatPat and I have stepped up

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.009
to the challenge to do something with
sulfur hexafluoride and boy howdy are we

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.899
doing all sorts of things today your
request has been answered so we've got

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.570
an aquarium we've got some balloons
we've got some tanks here can you tell

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.920
us briefly what's going on Mat no this
isn't my video all right so this

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.410
something you've ever stopped to
consider like if you're living in a

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.620
different place a different atmosphere
it might actually change the way that

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.610
you talk I've never really stopped to
think about it until just this moment so

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.760
we've got a few experiments so we're
going to try today you went down to the

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.730
store and picked up this bottle of
helium it did this is just party balloon

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.210
helium and it's actually I mean they do
kind of dilute it a little bit there's

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.909
20% air in here but guaranteed up to 80% helium so we all know what

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.640
happens when you put your mouth over
this take a big suck and try to talk yes

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.400
(Singing in a high voice) "Hello my baby, Hello my honey, Hello my ragtime gal"

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.400
(Normal voice) So helium makes times less dense than air so what happens is as
you're speaking your vocal chords

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.560
vibrate a little bit faster and your
voice sounds higher now there's another

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.049
gas that I'm sure you are all familiar
with by now called sulfur hexafluoride

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.740
sulfur hexafluoride is actually six
times heavier than air so theoretically

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.920
it should have the opposite effect right
this is a tank of sulfur hexafluoride

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.470
it's actually the smallest tank I could
purchase it costs me $1,400 and it takes

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.270
(MatPat: Humblebrag! Rakin' out the dough!) 
I'm just I'm just saying it's not easy stuff

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.320
to get and it cost it's about 50
pounds here to lift it up so I think we

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.590
got a lifetime supply needless to say
and it's got this thing that protects

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.380
the valve so as its rolling around a
truck or whatnot it's not going to

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.049
accidentally spill out so let's go ahead
and take the cap off here fill up a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.630
balloon and see what kind of fun we can
have

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.069
with SF6 we both have two different
colored balloons here I have a white

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.250
balloon my friend Mat has chosen to go
to the

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.180
dark side in my balloon is helium gas
which is six times lighter than air

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.340
which means (Grant speaking with a high voice) it makes my voice incredibly
high and this is an experiment we're all

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.460
familiar with everybody loves helium but
on the other hand (MatPat:) sulfur hexafluoride is

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.940
actually six times heavier than air
which means that when I suck it in,

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:38.880
(MatPat speaking with a deep voice) my voice becomes super deep and super intense. Come over and join the dark side!! get to the chopper! to the chopper!

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.540
(Normal voice) here's the
experiment one half breath helium one

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.790
half breath sulfur hexafluoride what's
going to happen that's my usual charming

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.700
everyday Midwestern voice grant that's
clearly what's going to happen here so

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:59.810
this is me its a me mario now its a me mario hey that
was actually fairly normal it does

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.220
actually sound very normal slightly too much of this but overall

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.060
kind of balances out hey its a me mario ho! this stuff is actually heavier than air so it sits in

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.100
your lungs you can actually hear my
voice is going through a little bit

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.489
transition point right now like he's
going through puberty because the gas

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.820
won't come out of your lungs unless you
blow it out really really aggressively

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:28.700
like *heavy breathing* and then we should be pretty close and if you can't get it out just

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.320
stand on your head for a couple minutes
should be fine it'll just leak out

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.590
man awesome okay crazy so now that we've
demonstrated how heavy this gas really

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.489
is there's an experiment that I wouldn't
wanting to try with an aquarium filling

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.459
this gas up in an aquarium where it's
completely invisible and bringing out a

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.120
tinfoil boat this isn't a new experience
for the Internet

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.239
I was gonna say it'll be new to me but
I've never the new experience for us and

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.130
some we haven't tried before so awesome
let's go grab some tinfoil do it yes

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:04.000
alright guys so here is the setup, we have a pitcher full of dry ice and a cup of water, you know what happens when we mix water and dry ice

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.880
I'm trying to say is that we're going to
pour that vapor into this aquarium and it

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.600
should show us the levels of the gas now  normally dry vapor flows at the bottom

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:15.030
or I start pouring some sulfur
hexafluoride and observe the difference. you with me?

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.100
I'm with you they might not be with you
but I'm with you grant okay that's

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.479
actually good enough that's perfect
this is the time in my life where I feel

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:33.340
like a true mad scientist yeah you can
see the driest vapor flows right to the

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.880
bottom of the aquarium there's nothing
to stop it and it fills up the entire

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.590
aquarium with a dry spot all right that
should be good enough what I want to see

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.060
happen is if we really little bit of this
gas into the aquarium

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:48.620
like what's it going to do if anything
kind of hard to see anything happening

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:54.610
is a well now that it's in there though
if I pour in yeah try pouring a little

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.970
bit Warren see if there's any difference
oh it's really interesting is it's

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:02.110
floating at the top I'm going to say now
you'll notice it's not going down to the

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.330
bottom it's it's like three-quarters of
the way full

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:09.370
what's this invisible gas today this is
really unexpected I had no idea that

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:12.190
just that small bit from the balloon
would actually feel this aquarium to

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.910
course away but you can honestly see the
joy Roger gleaming up here so I think

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.580
what we're going to do is take this
white board cover the top and take a

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.699
little bit more gas and pump it in there
yeah and then we'll see if we can fill

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.419
up this thing completely to where it's
like literally at the top and we got

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:27.490
this dry vapor just flowing over the top
let's do it

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.150
Oh all right let's hold this right here
so you I'm thinking if we vent some in

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:40.690
here it'll push everything out there I
told you we had death

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.919
okay so now theoretically if that worked
we will have sulfur hexafluoride pretty

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.710
much filled this tank and yet we put in
a little more Drive safer we may be able

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:52.150
to see something on the top hopefully

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.139
yeah whoa it won't even get into the
aquarium at all

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:01.849
force field look at that yeah you can
you can see it almost like you're

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:06.229
pouring water into like pouring water
into like a tank of water where you see

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:09.860
it kind of dipping below the surface so
that it's popping back up that's making

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.030
kind of an eerie fog isn't it yeah you
know I feel like I've got some like

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.190
small water balloons around here we
should blow up some water balloon and

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:22.460
see what happens in there does it float
oh wow it does it does you're done yeah

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.449
like dip down just enough and then it
settled on the surface it's just

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:32.389
hovering there well it kind of stuck to
the side but still interesting so it

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:34.849
makes me wonder if we can get a balloon
to flow do you think something like a

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:37.669
ping-pong ball would be able to float or
do you think that'll be too dense

00:06:37.669 --> 00:06:41.570
they would just hole I think wonderful
absolutely it's really good right what

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.430
do you guys think
push your comments below will a

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:45.889
ping-pong ball float on sulfur
hexafluoride

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:50.539
all right gas has been transferred okay
ping-pong ball there you go I'm actually

00:06:50.539 --> 00:07:02.990
voting it's not going to work really
that's my vote all right Oh shame that's

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:06.770
just a little bit too dense yeah they're
a bit heavy that would be crazy though

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.699
if you could play ping-pong in midair
that would that would be nuts like if

00:07:10.699 --> 00:07:16.099
you could actually spume oh that's cool
look at that that's awesome this is

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:18.440
flammable
it's non flammable okay actually

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.870
although I have a series what happens if
we give this into the sulfur

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:25.370
hexafluoride this immediately goes out
oh wow

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:30.229
and you can even see the remnants smoke
from the flame floating on top of the

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:33.409
sulfur hexafluoride level that we have a
people area that's correct yeah you can

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:37.940
see it bouncing around it's like a wave
it's wall without soap lirikl said

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:41.810
earlier it's completely not
what's next what are we gonna do now Oh

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:46.580
pick me pick me all right Matt can we do
that boat thing you talked about at the

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.060
beginning yes we've seen people do
little boats out of tinfoil and

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.690
basically the same thing we just did
with the balloon except with one small

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:58.039
twist let's just show you in just a
second so grab the aluminum foil and

00:07:58.039 --> 00:08:01.000
let's see if we can make a boat hits me
with aluminum foil

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.070
thanks all right here it is this is our
best attempt question about this do you

00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.910
think it's going to be wide enough to
displace enough gas to like compensate

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:16.789
for how heavy it is no I don't actually
I would love to be optimistic in this

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:21.800
scenario but let's be the crushing voice
of realism here this will not float

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.580
okay guys speaking of predictable make
your predictions now which boat is going

00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:32.000
to float this one this one or neither or
both okay if you don't mind I'm going to

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:41.180
try this boat first and he has a higher
chance of success Oh No what the heck I

00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:45.320
thought it was going to work their first
time did you I did yeah sorry and if I

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:51.850
never have oh you can folks this is
Jason's boat there you go

00:08:52.089 --> 00:08:55.760
what are we doing wrong guys why can't
we get this to work other people are

00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.620
doing it maybe our aluminum foil is too
thick I think it's a combination of just

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.860
the overall thickness of that
high-quality target brand and up enough

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:09.200
aluminum foil but also you'll notice we
have a lot of excess in our boat like I

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:12.560
feel like the optimum boat for this is
just going to be like very clean fold

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.700
not wrinkled at all because all of these
wrinkles are just adding to the surface

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:20.480
area the amount of tin foil that we're
using in this case thereby making our

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.089
boat heavier and heavier
that sounds spent time going before he

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.720
said there you go boom science drop in
knowledge

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:44.480
I mean really think a little slower so
you can see the fog is near the top here

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:54.160
yep we had our boat will it float oh we
are tremendous failures what do we go

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.850
from here and do we keep pushing to make
it work or do we just accept our destiny

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:03.399
and move on maybe we should build our
boat first we'll give that a chance to

00:10:03.399 --> 00:10:07.839
settle down build a boat take the lid
off very carefully and try one more time

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:21.069
all right all right here we go I'm going
to set another boat another experiment

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:28.860
will it work the best camp

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:39.910
it was right there you know where I
still stand by the fact I don't know if

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:43.840
we have to tape it or what but it's
these little whole areas of the fold

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.820
where I mean it's a gas right and so
just like water just like air it finds

00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:52.900
the way in wherever it can and in this
case I think we're we pulled it up the

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.720
wall yeah where it's all creeping in I
think you're right

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.080
and there's not really a lightweight
tape like if you add too much weight

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.840
it's going to sink right and if you
don't plug the holes it's going to say

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:04.330
this thing it's really a fine line
trying to figure out how to engineer

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:09.630
this thing yeah but that out of all of
them so far was that be playful

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:17.050
I just want to say even though we had so
much difficulty getting the tinfoil boat

00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:21.160
to actually work it just goes to show
what you see isn't always what you get

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:23.590
there are a lot of variables that come
into play when you try this for yourself

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.000
go check out game theory it's a really
good family-friendly educational content

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.550
and you're going to learn something on
every episode it's true and we actually

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.660
have special episodes on game theory
with Grant exploring the Pokemon player

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:39.280
world on film searing we have us doing
some waterbending experiments that grant

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.320
helped us to do and on GT live our live
stream we actually did some flavor

00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.500
manipulation which was pretty wild
messing with our taste buds so a lot of

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:51.220
what you like on this channel but over
there in science II getting even nerdier

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.300
and of course the big tanks in GD Nilo
932 for putting this request down in the

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:59.590
comments and go ahead and check your
youtube inbox GD Nilo 932 or sending 25

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:05.680
bucks No are you kidding for real gets
25 bucks 25 bucks man but most

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:13.240
importantly of all remember that's just
an experiment a random experiment thanks

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:20.890
for watching
quickly oh yeah there's definitely gap

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:22.960
there
