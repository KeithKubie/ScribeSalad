00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.600
NARRATOR: Kitty O'Neil has
been overcoming adversity

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.100
for her entire life,
starting with a major setback

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.600
when she was only
three years old.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.630
NARRATOR: In 1970, Kitty raced
a motorcycle in the Baja 1000.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.800
Through her off-road exploits,
she met legendary Hollywood

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.930
stunt man Hal Needham.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.630
Needham had taken up
directing, overseeing

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.230
the smash hit "Smokey
and the Bandit,"

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:33.900
but stunts remained
his first love,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.930
and he got Kitty
into the business.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.400
She was in many movies,
including "Blues Brothers,"

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:42.870
"Smokey and the Bandit."

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.370
She actually was the stunt
double for Wonder Woman--

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:46.300
Lynda Carter's Wonder Woman.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.030
I think it'd be a
seamless transition

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.530
to go from being a
stuntwoman to land

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.870
speed racing because you need
that same amount of just crazy.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.900
Kitty could drive just
about anything, fearlessly.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.630
NARRATOR: That fearlessness
would lead her to a land speed

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.170
project put together by stunt
designer Bill Frederick, who

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.300
built a three-wheeled hydrogen
peroxide-powered rocket

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.200
car called the SMI Motivator.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.530
On December 6th, 1976, at
the Alvord Desert in Oregon,

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.170
Kitty strapped into the
Motivator looking to surpass

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.870
the women's land speed record.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.470
The mark of 308.56
miles per hour

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.600
had been set in 1965
by Lee Breedlove,

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.370
wife of legendary land
speed racer Craig Breedlove.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.900
Her to go after that record
definitely took a lot of guts.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.300
NARRATOR: Kitty achieved
an incredible average

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.470
of 512 miles per hour using
only 60% of the vehicle's power.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.930
Kitty now had her sights set
on the overall speed record.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.400
That latest mark had been set
in 1970 by Gary Gabelich, a test

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.430
subject for the Apollo
astronaut missions,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.330
who had driven a
rocket-powered car to a mark

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.200
of 622.407 miles per hour.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.000
Unfortunately for Kitty,
she was only meant

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.470
to break the women's record.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.330
The overall record was
promised to her old friend

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.030
Hal Needham, who had paid
25 grand for the honor.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.930
She was about to become,
literally, the world

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.300
land speed record holder.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.530
She was this close.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.070
She was almost there.

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:30.000
And they said, nope.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.300
And they pulled
her out of the car,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.630
and she didn't get to
set the next record.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.770
NARRATOR: Perhaps as an
act of karmic retribution,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.900
the weather turned,
making the track

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.630
unsuitable for Hal's attempt
before he arrived to make it.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.170
Refusing to be silenced,
Kitty set two different kinds

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.900
of speed records in 1977.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.400
In June, she drove the fastest
quarter mile in history

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.200
in 3.22 seconds, hitting a top
speed of 412 miles per hour.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.930
In August, she piloted a boat to
a speed of 275 miles per hour,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.270
becoming the fastest
woman on the water.

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.130
Kitty retired from the
speed record game in 1982

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.900
after leaving a lasting mark
on the sport and the world.
