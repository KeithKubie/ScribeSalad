00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:02.520
&gt;&gt;Winnie Lam: Hello everyone.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.140
Iím Winnie Lam.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.240
Thank you so much for attending this talk
about oceans.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.349
We have two esteemed scientists here with
us from the Wildlife Conservation Society

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.219
whoís gonna tell us about our oceans.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:19.900
Weíve got Claudio Campagna, Doctor Claudio
Campagna, and, um, Dr. Caleb McClennon both

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.060
from the Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.070
Dr. Claudio Campagna is the leading scientist
of the Wildlife Conservation Societyís Patagonian

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.560
Sea Program.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.400
He specializes in the biology and conservation
of marine mammals.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.220
In addition to having published five books
and 60 scientific papers, heís also been

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.680
the scientific advisor for the BBC and the
National Geographic Channel.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.100
Heís gonna talk to us about our oceans.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.540
And Dr. Caleb McClennon is the Marine Conservation
Director at the Wildlife Conservation Society.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.080
He works on improving our fisheries management
globally so that we can conserve marine biodiversity

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.690
worldwide.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.210
And for those of you who are here to hear
about the trip to Belize, heís gonna talk

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.750
to us about that.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.610
So without further ado letís give a very
warm welcome to our guests, Dr. Claudio Campagna

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.460
and Dr. Caleb McClennon.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.440
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Thank you, Winnie, and
thanks everyone for taking some time out of

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.020
your busy day to be here with us.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.070
So, as Winnie mentioned, weíre gonna go through
a bit of some of the most fascinating places

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.150
in the worldís oceans today, some of the
challenges we face and then some stories of

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.930
hope that where weíre working and other people
are working to make a significant difference

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.020
in improving the health of the oceans.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.670
And we wanna focus, specifically, on the Patagonian
Sea, a place where Claudio has spent close

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.680
to 30 years of his life working to help, to
help save and with remarkable progress and

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.630
I think really an inspiration to all of us
that we can make a big difference out there.

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.810
And then finally Iíll close with just a short
summary of this opportunity that we have to

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.700
host some volunteers in a Glover's Reef Research
Station in Belize and provide you a bit more

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.310
details about that opportunity and then weíll
have some time for questions.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.230
So thank you all and itís really a pleasure
to be here at Google.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.800
So, when we think about the oceans and what
drew you here or what inspires people to think

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.050
about caring about our seas.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.200
Everyone has some sort of image like this
in their heads.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.800
For me this is diving, actually at Glover's
Reef in Belize with two different species,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.440
a Bottlenose and a Beak dolphin, swam side
by side next to me and just blow your mind

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.890
away in terms of taking you away from humanity
and bringing you into the sea.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.040
So all of you probably, from some part of
your life, have your own image like this where

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.620
youíve connected individually on a personal
level with some species in the sea.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.640
And if you havenít, it will happen and it
will really be fantastic.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.090
So thereís these moments that are inspirational,
thereís also vast ocean ecosystems that have

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.890
tremendous biodiversity.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.050
This is from Bunaken Reserve in the heart
of the coral triangle where you have 600 species

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.340
of coral reef, 3,000 species of reef fish.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.790
For people who have been there and have seen
it, itís like no other place on the planet.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.770
Itís the center, the center of origin for
marine biodiversity on the planet, a place

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.240
that is beyond comparison.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.819
This is in the center of Indonesia in the
IndoPacific coral triangle.

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.569
So the oceans have this fantastic biodiversity,
this fantastic wildlife, these incredibly

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:39.620
important ecosystems but as we know, the oceans
are also critically important for the livelihoods

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.170
of tens of millions of people around the world.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.130
They provide critical seafood for over a billion
people on the planet.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.240
Ninety percent of fishermen living on the
planet are depending on oceans in small scale

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:52.240
aspects like these.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:58.209
These are two fishermen off the coast of Madagascar,
living on one or two dollars a day, 100 percent

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.640
protein for their families is coming from
the sea.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.690
So the sea is not just some fantastic aspect
of biodiversity for us to go to vacation to

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:11.069
and see, but is an elemental part of coastal
livelihoods throughout the world.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.639
And this is really an important essence of
the oceans to also remember.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:23.189
So when, on the other side of fishing from
the sea, thereís also as we know, and probably

00:04:23.189 --> 00:04:27.509
people have heard far too much about, the
over-fishing crisis that we face on the planet.

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:31.629
We have trawlers, trawling in very close to
the shore line in places that have almost

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:37.940
no rules, taking in bycatch of marine turtles
and dolphins and over harvesting too many

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.469
species without any sort of regulations.

00:04:41.469 --> 00:04:46.240
We are now importing far more seafood from
the developing world than we produce in the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.009
developed world.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.650
We are inadequately managing our fisheries
and taking them from places we have no idea

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.550
with the population structure, how much fish
we could possibly take out of the ocean.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.569
So thereís a significant challenge that is
the industrial scale fisheries that are increasingly

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:06.650
moving into resource-poor and governance -poor
places.

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.979
An articulation of this is the crisis we face
with shark finning and shark fisheries today.

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:16.780
We woke up to the whales in the early part
of last century and we started an international

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.360
commitment to saving the great whales on this
planet.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.419
As a result, around the world whale populations
are rebounding.

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.780
In 1970s, we woke up to sea turtles and as
a result many sea turtle populations around

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.259
the world are rebounding.

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.509
Today, weíre waking up to the shark finning
crisis.

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:39.580
WCS research that we had done in the last
decade indicates that between 40 and 70 million

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:42.819
sharks are taken, a year, from our oceans.

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:46.909
Almost none of the shark populations are assessed,
almost none of these fisheries are controlled.

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.770
This is a species crisis in the oceans of
our day.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.249
As we, as was articulated two summers ago,
oil and gas extraction and is moving, has

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:02.080
moved into the Gulf of Mexico and is now moving
off shore to a number of countries around

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080
the world.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.749
This is a National Geographic map of oil infrastructure
in the Gulf moving out to about 150 miles.

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:10.900
This is physical infrastructure in the ocean.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:14.530
When you look out in the ocean off the coast
of California, you see almost none of this

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.169
physical infrastructure because thereís moratorium
in oil drilling.

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:22.770
The Gulf of Mexico is a very different story
and the waters of a lot of countries around

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.710
the world is a very different story in terms
of oil exploration This is changing the way

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.930
we think of the oceans.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:32.189
Weíre thinking about it as a space; a space
to be used and a space to be managed in a

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:36.319
way that we only thought of possible on land
before.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:41.550
In some places, the rule of law for the oceans
is also incredibly challenging; such that

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.629
people are using dynamite still to fish or
to collect coastal aggregate materials for

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:47.629
construction.

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:51.279
This is a photo I took in the Marshall Islands,
where I lived for four years working for their

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:56.509
government, where theyíre still using reef
resources for mining materials because there

00:06:56.509 --> 00:06:59.400
is no other resources for construction materials.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:06.249
So the physical use of near shore reefs is
another significant challenge we face.

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:10.110
And then finally, as we all have heard from
many different angles, but we cannot mention

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.029
the oceans without describing the situation
of climate change and its impact to the oceans.

00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:20.500
This is a reef in Aceh in Indonesia a year
ago prior to, a year and a half ago, prior

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.379
to the bleaching event that bleached out 100
percent of certain species of corals, in a

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:26.939
site where we worked.

00:07:26.939 --> 00:07:32.169
So the white is what happens to corals when
all their symbiotic algae is expelled and

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:37.460
if the temperatures do not decrease after
a few weeks, the corals die, and thatís what

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.789
has happened in Indonesia.

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:43.039
It happened in a lot of places around the
world when temperatures were elevated.

00:07:43.039 --> 00:07:51.289
So, like many ecosystems, the global impact
on climate change is also a considerable challenge.

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:55.990
This all being said, there is significant
hope in the oceans like there has not been

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:57.090
before.

00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:01.819
There is a changing mindset in people and
in countries around the world to try to find

00:08:01.819 --> 00:08:07.229
a way to better protect, better manage your
fisheries, expand protected areas out in the

00:08:07.229 --> 00:08:12.249
oceans, ensure smart growth as opposed to
unregulated growth of extractive industries

00:08:12.249 --> 00:08:16.969
and invest significantly more into scientific
research and understanding of the vast waters

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:17.999
of our planet.

00:08:17.999 --> 00:08:23.509
Weíve invested a lot of money and time in
understanding domestic waters of the US.

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:27.110
And now a lot of that is changing to expand
throughout the world.

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:32.529
Just to point you out a bit of where we focus
is that thereís three centers of marine biodiversity

00:08:32.529 --> 00:08:34.030
in the planet.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.810
Basically the western edge of ocean basins,
so the western edge of the Atlantic is the

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:41.540
Caribbean, western edge of the Indian, the
western Indian Ocean and the western edge

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:45.400
of the Pacific Ocean, these are the hearts
of marine biodiversity.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.270
Areas that are generally very nutrient poor
but have vast coral reef resources.

00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:56.130
So these places are, in a planet that is covered
72 percent by ocean, some of the most critical

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.930
places to work to expand in protected areas
and improving fisheries.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.600
There are also some places, again, along the
coast, where the greatest amount of productivity

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:10.360
is happening on the oceans, where 90 percent
of marine life is existing in the coastal

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.870
zone and you have huge aggregations of coastal
wildlife.

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:17.610
The Congo basin coast in Central Africa has
the worldís largest population of Leatherback

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:18.610
Sea Turtles.

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:22.710
For folks that have seen Leatherbacks, theyíre
talking 9 feet long, these creatures that

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:27.580
are extremely vulnerable, the last, the largest
population in the planet lives here and is

00:09:27.580 --> 00:09:29.030
doing very well.

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.920
The Bay of Bengal has the worldís largest
population of Irrawaddy river dolphins and

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.010
coastal cetaceans
. But the government of Bangladesh, one of

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.830
the poorest countries on the planet, just
put in a protected area to protect a whole

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:44.570
slew of the population of river dolphins that
is bigger by a factor of ten than any other

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.400
population on the planet.

00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:52.110
And in the Arctic, between Alaska and Russia,
which is experiencing incredible impacts from

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:56.550
climate change and receding of ice, there
was an effort to continue to protect walrus

00:09:56.550 --> 00:10:00.880
populations, ice seals to manage through this
change and the indigenous communities that

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.730
actually depend on these resources to stay
alive.

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:07.800
And then finally the Patagonia Coast where
Claudio and a number of people who work for

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:13.280
him and partner with him are protecting the
largest continental population of Southern

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:18.730
elephant seals, penguins, albatross, in a
way, in protecting and restoring that abundance

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:21.350
in a way that is unprecedented around the
planet.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:27.480
So there is incredible hope and incredible
demonstrated success of places where weíre

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.690
improving the health of the oceans and saving
a number of species and ecosystems.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:35.340
Iím just gonna close with a few slides.

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.480
Some narrow slices of anecdotes that I think
are quite interesting.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:44.450
These are several of our Indonesian staff
working together with some fisherman in Indonesia

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:50.530
that previously had used cyanide to fish for
the live reef fish trade; to take reef fish

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.040
out and bring them to restaurants still living
like we do with lobster.

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.970
And itís just a delicacy in East Asia.

00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:03.150
We worked with them to halt the cyanide fishing
in exchange to pilot some agriculture programs

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:07.460
where they can more sustainably produce what
the market is demanding.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.200
And as a result, they started managing their
fisheries better, thereís no more cyanide

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.060
on the reef and the biodiversity and the number
of fish is coming back out.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.120
And theyíre economically doing better than
they were doing when they were using cyanide

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120
in the reef.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.890
So a win win, economically for these fishers
who are living on very few amounts of dollars

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:29.080
per day and also for the marine resource,
critical in a place like Indonesia where you

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:33.590
have 200 million people living in an island
country that is extremely small.

00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:35.490
Thatís a photo from Belize.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.650
These are Nassau Grouper which are critically
threatened throughout the Caribbean.

00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:44.290
Most of the spawning aggregations of Nassau
Grouper have gone ecologically extinct in

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.540
the Caribbean because they come together to
breed, and thatís a very easy time to fish

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:50.540
them.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:54.390
In Belize, the government of Belize over the
last thirty years protected all of the spawning

00:11:54.390 --> 00:12:00.450
aggregations of Nassau Grouper and in some
places such as Glover's Reef, weíve quadrupled

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.520
the spawning populations of Nassau Grouper
as a result of protecting them where theyíre

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.890
spawning and also more smartly managing the
fisheries in the areas where weíre not able

00:12:08.890 --> 00:12:11.600
to protect that species alone.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.480
So a significant bounce back of a species
that we thought may go ecologically extinct

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.270
throughout the Caribbean because of the tremendous
value.

00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:23.020
And this, again, is taken at Glover's Reef,
these are magnificent fish.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:26.350
These are some guards working in Gabon in
Africa.

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:30.010
Thereís a country in Central Africa, as I
mentioned the worldís largest population

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.070
of Leatherback Sea Turtles.

00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:35.310
The government of Gabon created, about 10
years ago created a significant network of

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:39.200
terrestrial protected areas to protect this
terrestrial biodiversity.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.230
And just now theyíre committing, on the same
side, to create a large network of no-take

00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:49.570
marine reserves in the waters, to protect
marine species, to protect fisheries and to

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.570
ensure larger protection for the overarching
marine ecosystem in a country in Central Africa

00:12:54.570 --> 00:13:00.640
which is unprecedented for Africa, so incredible
hope for a place that has been generally under

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:02.980
prioritized.

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:07.010
And now we get to Claudio Campagna and some
of the work on the Southern Elephant Seal

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.360
and the Patagonia Sea.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.840
I think a story youíll hear from Claudio
today in understanding these animals and the

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:15.430
understanding of what can be done to restore
oceans.

00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:20.340
Not only in the US but around the world is
really impressive and needs to be replicated

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.570
in nearly every country.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.590
And so I will leave it to him to tell that
story of success and continued possibility

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:31.520
for expansion of caring for and protecting
our oceans that is unprecedented.

00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:37.340
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Well, that image actually
was helping me because this is being stretched

00:13:37.340 --> 00:13:40.330
like that so the animal was looking a little
bit larger.

00:13:40.330 --> 00:13:46.430
Yet, Elephant Seals are 5 meters long and
that was a particularly big one, so it was

00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:49.000
helping me but in the right direction.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:55.800
Iím going to talk about one place in the
ocean, the Southwest Atlantic of the way we

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.450
call it, Patagonian Sea.

00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:03.810
You have to imagine an area the size of the
Mediterranean Sea, more or less, 1.5 million,

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:08.000
2 million square kilometers.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.740
Most of these waters, the ones Iím specializing
in, are part of the economic exclusive zone

00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.190
of Argentina.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:25.190
However, these waters were very well known
in the 19th century because Darwin spent most

00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:30.960
of the Voyage of the Beagle in that area;
a couple of years at least.

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.000
But today the Argentines, not necessarily
understand it.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.170
Argentina is not a country that understands
ocean, oceans as much as it understands tango

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:43.330
and beef consumption.

00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:49.210
[laughter] Thatís not a minor issue for someone
that wants to do ocean conservation that requires

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:55.710
people to understand what the ocean means
and to put value into that.

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:00.110
This is more or less the way the world sees
the ocean.

00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:02.630
We just see the surface of the ocean.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.890
We donít have a very good understanding of
what the ocean means.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.410
And we see the ocean very close to the coast.

00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:11.790
We understand the ocean up to here, basically.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:17.610
And then we donít understand much more.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:25.510
This is a kind of, I wonder, but this is a
kind of idea that I would suggest most people

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.780
have about the ocean.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.430
Itís like a little bit of a combination of
reality and mythology.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:34.710
Itís a surrealist perspective of the ocean.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:37.430
And there are good reasons.

00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:47.670
If you look at some of the ocean creatures,
they're very, very appropriate to create,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:53.640
to promote our imagination about creatures
that do not exist.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:16:05.529
Have a look at this Southern Right Whale or
at least South American sea lion.

00:16:05.529 --> 00:16:11.800
These dolphins, mermaids, people were thinking
about these animals like that, or monsters,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:17.410
it was not inappropriate, they were having
that understanding.

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:26.630
Just imagine ten thousand years ago, somebody
walking around the coast of Peninsula Valdez

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:35.210
in Argentina seeing these kinds of scenarios.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:38.240
People were having that perspective about
the ocean.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:43.140
The perspective that combines little bit of
imagination with a little bit of reality.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.810
Then the scientists came and we changed that
perspective.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:55.430
But we start to see the ocean in a very cold
way; satellite pictures of productivity; of

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.430
ocean temperature.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:02.090
We were capable of understanding where most
ocean production was taking place.

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:08.459
But we started to lose sight of that mythology,
of that particular attachment that came from

00:17:08.459 --> 00:17:13.839
the heart that caused fear but also caused
inspiration.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:18.049
I think that the Conservation is trying to
bring together both worlds.

00:17:18.049 --> 00:17:22.860
And this is what we have been trying to do
in Argentina.

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.690
My work there is on Elephant Seals, I work
on these big creatures.

00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:33.299
What I do, what I started to do was to observe
the social behavior of these animals.

00:17:33.299 --> 00:17:35.409
You have a Northern Elephant Seal very close
by.

00:17:35.409 --> 00:17:38.110
I strongly suggest you have a look at that.

00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:41.879
What we were doing most of the time is we
were sitting there on the beach watching the

00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:45.110
behavior of these animals on the coast.

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:51.470
But then in the mid 1980s, the technology
was available to us, to understand what these

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:57.410
animals were doing when they were going to
the ocean, at sea.

00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:06.110
Let me spend a second just to, okay, what
they were doing at sea.

00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:12.340
One thing that we did immediately is to put
some recorders that were telling us about

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.549
the diving behavior of Elephant Seals.

00:18:15.549 --> 00:18:23.539
And the people that were doing that work discovered
that Elephant Seals can dive up to a mile

00:18:23.539 --> 00:18:24.539
under water.

00:18:24.539 --> 00:18:28.539
And they can spend up to two hours without
coming back to the surface.

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.350
They are mammals; they have to come back to
the surface to get air.

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.690
And this was being discovered in the mid 1980s,
really.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:41.279
With the Northern Elephant seal, he is very
close by research by AÒo Nuevo doing, working

00:18:41.279 --> 00:18:43.720
on AÒo Nuevo from UC Santa Cruz.

00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:49.610
At the time that was being done, technology
also allowed us to put instruments on Elephant

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:55.370
Seals that told us where the animals were
located in the ocean.

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.029
Iím talking the early 1990s.

00:18:59.029 --> 00:19:05.779
And we discovered these animals were not find
food very close, like 5 kilometers, 10 kilometers,

00:19:05.779 --> 00:19:14.929
100 kilometers, but very far away; 1,000 miles,
2,000 miles off the coast.

00:19:14.929 --> 00:19:19.460
So all the sudden, we were facing a completely
new challenge.

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:26.390
For us protection, at the time, meant to do
something when the animals were on the coast,

00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:31.440
to create protected areas to protect their
reproductive sites.

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.400
But Elephant Seals were spending 80 percent
of their time in the far away ocean, in the

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:42.330
open ocean, in the deep ocean, in the international
waters, places that were not protected at

00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:44.210
all.

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:48.659
We scientists, devoted to conservation, do
worry about these things.

00:19:48.659 --> 00:19:55.070
Cause we donít see the ocean like most people
do when they just approach the coast for a

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.980
vacation and they get all the beauty, we are
sensitive to that.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:06.419
But, unfortunately, you have a special perspective
that looks at the ocean with the problems

00:20:06.419 --> 00:20:07.690
that the ocean has.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:13.970
So when Iím in Patagonia and I see a Magellanic
Penguin, of course I see the beauty of a Magellanic

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:20.299
Penguin, but I have seen also many, many oil
Magellanic Penguins so I want to do something.

00:20:20.299 --> 00:20:25.049
When Iím working on Elephant Seals, of course
I love the social behavior they have when

00:20:25.049 --> 00:20:30.770
they fight, they get very excited about that,
but then I see all the animals that are being

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:38.100
entangled because they get all these garbage
in the ocean, for some reason, they just swim

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.640
in and there are nets around their necks.

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:46.460
So, as conservationists, we have to face a
reality that many people donít want.

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.250
Is this what, I think thereís an expression
in English, this is a gloom and doom kind

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:51.360
of situation.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.039
People say, ìOkay, we want to avoid that.

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:57.400
We want to avoid bad news.î Unfortunately,
we conservationists have to deal with that

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:00.610
because we want to solve those problems.

00:21:00.610 --> 00:21:04.590
When we were learning what Elephant Seals
were doing in the ocean we conservationists

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.929
want to protect the areas where they are.

00:21:07.929 --> 00:21:10.779
That means to protect the ocean.

00:21:10.779 --> 00:21:16.289
Imagine that the coast of a national park
on land is already a very difficult concept.

00:21:16.289 --> 00:21:22.590
If you want to create a national park in the
ocean, how do you start?

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:27.249
Particularly considering that most people
donít even understand the ocean beyond the

00:21:27.249 --> 00:21:28.350
knee.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:33.330
So we need to establish, itís a communication
problem, we need to establish that cause of

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:38.830
in the international community, in my case,
in the Argentine, and Southern Cone community.

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:44.140
And this is what we have been doing in the
last ten years and I will be telling you a

00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:48.200
now, a little bit of a story about what the
achievements were.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.549
First we started out, as I was telling you,
on coastal issues.

00:21:52.549 --> 00:21:57.749
And we created a lot of coastal protected
areas.

00:21:57.749 --> 00:22:03.360
A few years ago, the first coastal national
park was created in Argentina.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:09.809
That was an achievement and that was a result
of long term research being done along the

00:22:09.809 --> 00:22:12.739
entire coast of Argentina on many species.

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:18.631
Of publishing papers, publishing reports,
giving talks, talking to the Government, all

00:22:18.631 --> 00:22:24.450
of that together resulted in the first coastal
national park of Argentina.

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:27.610
And thatís something to celebrate.

00:22:27.610 --> 00:22:33.720
Another thing that happened very recently
is the creation of whatís called the Interjurisdictional

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720
Park.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:40.159
That is a park that belongs partially to the
province, the province of Chubut and partially

00:22:40.159 --> 00:22:43.419
to the federal government, the national parks.

00:22:43.419 --> 00:22:48.519
They got together, they speak to each other
and they decided to create a protected area

00:22:48.519 --> 00:22:50.249
along the coast of Patagonia.

00:22:50.249 --> 00:22:56.279
Thatís a very positive result, a very, very
encouraging result.

00:22:56.279 --> 00:22:58.640
And protected areas like those, there are
many.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:01.880
There are about 40 along the coast of Patagonia.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.409
Some of them have been created in the 1980s
with the work of the pioneer people that went

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:09.499
there to explore.

00:23:09.499 --> 00:23:12.120
Now weíre implementing more than exploring.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:15.249
And itís happening, itís taking place, itís
taking momentum.

00:23:15.249 --> 00:23:21.379
Itís a great time of history for that area
of the world, now, because many of the people

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:26.200
that weíre trying to study these animals;
Iíll go back to that.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:30.159
Many people who are trying to study these
animals now have some power.

00:23:30.159 --> 00:23:35.629
Let me illustrate very quickly what I have
said because perhaps you will get some better

00:23:35.629 --> 00:23:39.700
idea, itís better to take home messages if
I go very, very quickly.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:40.950
Yeah.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.519
So I was here and I was saying, imagine youíre
walking here along the coast

00:23:45.519 --> 00:23:50.610
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: And all of a sudden you
see a killer whale stranded trying to get

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.260
sea lions.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.700
Well, the other beauty is not just about individuals,
itís about colonies.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:02.019
This is what you have in a temperate system,
lots of animals gathering together, very important

00:24:02.019 --> 00:24:07.309
because they are very vulnerable, very beautiful.

00:24:07.309 --> 00:24:09.869
Look at these black browed albatrosses.

00:24:09.869 --> 00:24:15.980
They are reproducing in an island.

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.019
I mean, I just have so many things to say.

00:24:19.019 --> 00:24:27.230
This is a colony of Elephant Seals, where
I work, that well, this is the way that scientists

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:29.299
are looking at these animals and these are
another way.

00:24:29.299 --> 00:24:34.340
I wanna show you this, this is the distribution
of biodiversity, donít pay too much attention

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:39.629
to it, but whatís telling you is that you
donít find animals equally distributed in

00:24:39.629 --> 00:24:40.629
the ocean.

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:44.070
There are some places that are really much
worse in terms of protection that require

00:24:44.070 --> 00:24:49.809
much more work because, either there are many
more species or some species are so unique

00:24:49.809 --> 00:24:53.840
that if you donít protect them they are not
being protected.

00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.220
But this is the idea that I was telling you
that when how I feel when I do conservation

00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.220
work.

00:24:59.220 --> 00:25:02.879
I feel that there is some threat all the time.

00:25:02.879 --> 00:25:05.880
When I see these animals, I think about that.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:09.639
Itís not occurring at this place, itís not
taking place but it did occur in the past.

00:25:09.639 --> 00:25:12.850
When I see these animals, I also see this.

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:16.379
This is still occurring today.

00:25:16.379 --> 00:25:22.789
Okay, thatís the image of a conservationist.

00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:31.190
We feel the weight of trying to support wildlife
and actually we are quite happy to do that.

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.690
One of the issues that we conservationists
in the ocean have to deal with is fisheries.

00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:40.480
Look at this boat, this boat uses all that
light to fish squid.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480
Look at this image.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.429
This is a photograph from a satellite.

00:25:43.429 --> 00:25:47.509
Thereís more light there than in the city
Buenos Aires, almost.

00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:52.409
And this is about a thousand miles long.

00:25:52.409 --> 00:26:01.100
We're worried about these kind of issues;
entanglement, by catch, garbage in the ocean,

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:05.840
but we are many, trying to solve those problems.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:08.340
And we are there in the field every day.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.389
One thing that we do is science, satellite
tracking animals.

00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:14.389
This is one thing that I satellite track,
look at that.

00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:21.330
Left Peninsula Valdes went to the Malvinas-Falkland
Islands, round the Cape, into the South Pacific

00:26:21.330 --> 00:26:27.820
open oceans to the Fjords of Chile and through
the Magellan Channel back to Peninsula Valdes.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.450
This was a juvenile, those are the kinds of
challenges that we face if we want to protect

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:33.450
the ocean.

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:36.519
We have to come up with solutions to animals
that use the oceans like that.

00:26:36.519 --> 00:26:37.659
And there are many.

00:26:37.659 --> 00:26:42.269
There is not just the Elephant Seals, thereís
several species of penguins, turtles, etcetera.

00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:45.649
Look at what the dimensions there are using
in the ocean.

00:26:45.649 --> 00:26:49.809
There are over a million of square kilometers
thatís why we have to think like that.

00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:53.230
Patagoniaís not just important because of
the resident species.

00:26:53.230 --> 00:26:56.919
This is an albatross that is reproducing in
New Zealand.

00:26:56.919 --> 00:27:01.989
After reproduction it crosses the Pacific,
spends some time along the coast of Chile

00:27:01.989 --> 00:27:07.869
and then goes round to the Patagonian Sea
and spends the winter there and after that

00:27:07.869 --> 00:27:13.860
goes round the world and back to the reproductive
area.

00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:23.389
We put together, integrated all this information
into an atlas that is accessible in the internet.

00:27:23.389 --> 00:27:24.940
Please have a look at this.

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:29.890
Itís www dot atlas dash marpatagonico dot
org.

00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:35.100
Youíll see the distribution of 16 different
species.

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:42.019
And youíll find out how they compare to each
other and you can put maps there of productivity

00:27:42.019 --> 00:27:45.809
to understand why theyíre distributed like
that.

00:27:45.809 --> 00:27:48.480
I was telling you we have created protective
areas.

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:52.049
Let me give you an example.

00:27:52.049 --> 00:27:58.100
The examples I was telling you, they are coastal
protected areas, but we are promoting open

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:01.509
ocean protected areas, this is the new concept.

00:28:01.509 --> 00:28:05.840
Some of these open ocean protected areas do
not need to be protected all year around.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.100
They could be temporarily protected when they
are very productive.

00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:16.950
Others have to be protected in a way that
move around, are not stable, itís not like

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:18.479
the land.

00:28:18.479 --> 00:28:22.639
In the ocean, things move so today youíre
protecting this but this is moving with the

00:28:22.639 --> 00:28:23.639
current.

00:28:23.639 --> 00:28:25.840
So in three months, youíre protecting this
area.

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:31.419
Those are the kinds of concepts that we are
trying to establish in the scientific community

00:28:31.419 --> 00:28:35.860
but also among the stake holders that are
using those resources.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:40.889
One of the very much open oceans, completely
open ocean protected area that was very recently

00:28:40.889 --> 00:28:44.299
created is in this particular area called
the Burdwood Bank.

00:28:44.299 --> 00:28:49.340
This is like an island under water and the
bottom of this bank is unique.

00:28:49.340 --> 00:28:53.200
There are a lot of, what we call, endemic
species, species that you just find there.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:58.320
And we protected a small portion of this,
but itís a beginning and itís very positive

00:28:58.320 --> 00:28:59.320
one.

00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:06.159
Iím not going to expect that you understand
this slide, of course, and itís not going

00:29:06.159 --> 00:29:11.889
to look great in YouTube but there is one
issue that I think you will understand.

00:29:11.889 --> 00:29:15.230
These are a group of fisheries called co-management
fisheries.

00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:22.210
Thereís a paper published in Science or Nature
recently, itís Nature, they did an evaluation,

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:26.499
social scientists did, an evaluation about
what was important for these fisheries.

00:29:26.499 --> 00:29:30.169
Why these fisheries were being successful.

00:29:30.169 --> 00:29:33.990
What made them sustainable?

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:39.350
First variable that explained that is leadership.

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:47.289
The leaders of those communities were capable
of negotiating procedures, methodologies,

00:29:47.289 --> 00:29:54.539
approaches that made those fisheries sustainable.

00:29:54.539 --> 00:30:00.779
Very close to that is protected areas, protected
areas do work.

00:30:00.779 --> 00:30:05.979
Of course, you need will in the community
and this is what thatís telling you.

00:30:05.979 --> 00:30:10.229
So, in conservation like in your field.

00:30:10.229 --> 00:30:12.379
leaders are critical.

00:30:12.379 --> 00:30:14.470
Individuals make the difference.

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:22.809
And this is our leaders in the field in WCS,
particularly in Patagonia.

00:30:22.809 --> 00:30:30.830
There are several and we have been working
there for almost half a century, 48 years,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:35.700
since WCS started to have a project in Patagonia.

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.419
I think that I want to leave you with that
idea.

00:30:39.419 --> 00:30:48.229
There is hope, we are achieving results, we
are facing huge problems but we feel that

00:30:48.229 --> 00:30:53.700
communicating that will, we are going to convince
people that there is another way of looking

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:58.509
at the ocean that has not been the old one
with all the myths and itís not only the

00:30:58.509 --> 00:31:00.159
ones that scientists use.

00:31:00.159 --> 00:31:06.490
There is one that people want, that combines
knowledge with the heart, and this is what

00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.760
we are trying to transmit.

00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.590
Thank you very much and this is the webpage
I was telling you, please search it.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.590
[Applause]

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:20.559
&gt;&gt; Caleb McClennon: So probably a number of
questions for Claudio that we asked to combine

00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:25.710
it all then weíll have question, answers
about 5 minutes between the two of us.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:31.919
So, obviously the creation, as you saw, there
are almost 50 reserves along the coast of

00:31:31.919 --> 00:31:36.859
Argentina over those years is unprecedented
in the world and really congratulatory to

00:31:36.859 --> 00:31:38.519
Claudio and his team.

00:31:38.519 --> 00:31:44.419
Iím gonna speak briefly about this opportunity
that weíve put together and Winnie has really

00:31:44.419 --> 00:31:50.210
been working with us to identify a way how
WCS, that works in 60 countries around the

00:31:50.210 --> 00:31:55.820
world with thousands of staff in all these
different places could work with Google and

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:00.080
one idea that came up was we have a few permanent
research stations.

00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:04.289
Research is really one component of conservation,
itís certainly not the entirety, but there

00:32:04.289 --> 00:32:09.399
are some research stations that we have and
some of them are ongoing research projects

00:32:09.399 --> 00:32:16.849
in places that weíve worked at 20 years or
so can use some assistance in terms of monitoring

00:32:16.849 --> 00:32:21.940
because it takes a lot of people power as
well as thinking to monitor the state of the

00:32:21.940 --> 00:32:22.940
ecosystem.

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:28.269
So this is an island in Belize which WCS has
owned for about 20 years.

00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:33.009
We donít do a lot of land purchases in our
organization but this is on Glover's Reef

00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:36.679
Atoll which is one of the only Atolls in the
Atlantic Ocean.

00:32:36.679 --> 00:32:42.909
So a Coral Atoll is a ring island with no
center, the center has subsided away so itís

00:32:42.909 --> 00:32:46.149
only coral growth keeping it above the sea.

00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:50.669
In order to protect this place; which is one
of the most important places in the Caribbean;

00:32:50.669 --> 00:32:53.499
which if you remember the beginning itís
one of the most important places in the entirety

00:32:53.499 --> 00:32:55.549
of the Atlantic Ocean.

00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:58.169
There needed to be a fisheries base there
for patrols.

00:32:58.169 --> 00:33:02.869
And the fisheries department has to be actively
out there and regulating the fisheries.

00:33:02.869 --> 00:33:08.409
As a result almost a third of the atoll is
fully protected and the rest is extremely

00:33:08.409 --> 00:33:13.830
well managed fishery, uncommon for the rest
of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef.

00:33:13.830 --> 00:33:17.789
So the fishery department has a small base
here that they use, that they use for free

00:33:17.789 --> 00:33:23.169
with us, and then we have our research station
where we have about twenty bunks.

00:33:23.169 --> 00:33:27.370
And I guess part of this is to be very clear
what type of accommodations we have there,

00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:33.590
basically twenty field bunks for staff, Iím
sorry for visiting scientists, student groups

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:37.480
and people that come through and assist us
with our research work.

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:41.840
So this is just a photo of the island and,
of course, we do a lot of work on all the

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.759
different aspects of the, a place we monitor
coral reef annually, spiny lobsters which

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:53.669
is the critical commercial fishery interest,
conch, different, several species of grouper,

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:58.820
we have a long term shark monitoring program,
interestingly the shark at Glover's Reef is

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:03.320
one of the only populations in the whole Mesoamerican
Barrier Reef that has been stable over the

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:08.260
last 20 years, whereas the rest of the areas
has started to go down.

00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:11.830
So itís, with all this monitoring has shown
and been able to inform the success of our

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:15.750
work but also help us adaptively manage as
time goes on.

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.260
So in thinking through with Winnie as a way
we might be able to work together, we have

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:24.130
a sea turtle monitoring project that happens
annually, itís coordinated with the fisheries

00:34:24.130 --> 00:34:28.180
department, all of work in Belize and in all
the countries where we work is done in coordination

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:29.940
with the management authority.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:36.480
And so the end of April we will be going out
and require and need people to help us run

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:42.960
some transects and help monitor the entirety
of the atoll for its resident sea turtle population.

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:48.660
So it turns out that we came to Glovers Reef
for its robust biodiversity in terms of coral

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:52.429
reef and the fish populations were very healthy.

00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:57.140
Some of our sea turtle researchers, similar
folks to Claudio, leaders in their field,

00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.870
came in and did some work and identified that
this is a critical habitat for a lot of juvenile

00:35:00.870 --> 00:35:01.870
turtles.

00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:06.730
So for the last four years weíve been running
transects on an annual basis to identify and

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.370
start monitoring that population.

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:12.551
Certainly not for 25 years, the way Claudio
has with Elephant Seals in Argentina, but

00:35:12.551 --> 00:35:17.250
weíre just starting to determine the relative
importance of the place.

00:35:17.250 --> 00:35:23.510
So itís a great opportunity to participate
itís certainly not a vacation in that we

00:35:23.510 --> 00:35:27.560
need the help and weíre not an ecotourism
outfit, weíre a research and conservation

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.090
organization.

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:33.930
So itís for anyone that is interested in
signing up or learning more about it, it is

00:35:33.930 --> 00:35:37.320
absolutely going to be some work that youíll
be doing.

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:42.250
And we need to be clear about that otherwise
expectations will be very, very far.

00:35:42.250 --> 00:35:48.430
What weíll be structuring the day like for
folks is half the day, we only have 8 slots,

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:52.880
so we only have the ability, though the station
can take more people, we can only actively

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:57.130
employ 8 people to be working on this and
we donít want to have a lot of people sitting

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:58.130
around.

00:35:58.130 --> 00:36:03.310
So one half of the day will be participating
in the transect, the line monitoring for sea

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:07.240
turtles, the other half of the day will be
to recover or recoup, actually maybe enjoy

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:09.250
a little bit of the island.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:14.520
And this is one island on the large atolls
so there is several actual tourism outfits

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.571
on the other parts of the island that we will
be able to find ways for people to have some

00:36:17.571 --> 00:36:18.880
time off.

00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:26.340
It will be 6 days that youíll be out here
on the island, then if you do decide to sign

00:36:26.340 --> 00:36:30.980
up and have some interest in this and decide
you want to see more of the country of Belize,

00:36:30.980 --> 00:36:35.680
cause thereís fantastic rain forest, jaguar
reserves, that would be on your own to stay

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:38.090
longer and arrange as well.

00:36:38.090 --> 00:36:42.470
Our team, we have a boat, weíll take you
out to the atoll, so about 40 miles off the

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:47.240
coast of Belize and then weíll take you back
at the end as well.

00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:49.520
So itís a really, we donít have a lot

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.830
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: of opportunities like this,
weíre not an organization that is, this is

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:57.760
not part of our model of conservation, itís
just this happened, Winnie was great.

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.530
We threw around probably twenty different
ways we might be able to work together, this

00:37:00.530 --> 00:37:05.860
talk today was one of them, and another was
this trip which Winnie has been fantastic

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:08.360
about trying to find a way for us to work
together.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:13.090
So, happy to answer questions about that,
questions about what you might see in Belize

00:37:13.090 --> 00:37:17.300
and then Claudio is here all the way from
Argentina as well, so I hope there might be

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:20.800
a few questions about the fantastic work that
theyíve been doing there.

00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:24.600
Thank you very much for your time, itís been
really great to have this opportunity, we

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:27.490
really appreciate it.

00:37:27.490 --> 00:37:28.490
[Applause]

00:37:28.490 --> 00:37:34.370
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: So if you have questions
if you donít mind using the microphone so

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:38.610
people could hear you or you could, I guess,
decide you donít want to be on the microphone.

00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:42.450
[Laughs]
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Yes.

00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:49.251
&gt;&gt;Female #1: I just want to, yeah so you guys
can hear me, exactly what kind of work [inaudible]

00:37:49.251 --> 00:37:51.170
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: So the timing youíll be
spending, because youíll be split into groups

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:56.270
of four, so the time youíll be spending on
[inaudible], youíll be out on a boat and

00:37:56.270 --> 00:38:02.560
swimming, so snorkeling, not scuba diving,
that would bring in a whole other set of complications,

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.330
snorkeling and we do linear transects swimming
for identifying any of the sea turtle groups,

00:38:08.330 --> 00:38:09.840
uh, species that are there.

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:14.630
So we have greens and hawksbill and sometimes
several other species that come through.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:16.200
But greens and hawksbill are the primary.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:23.180
Um, so itíd be about, uh, from when you leave
the dock, our pier here, thereíd be about

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:27.500
4 hours out to the survey site that we choose
for that day, cause itís a random selection

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.820
of sites throughout the Atoll; thereís some
statistical, no thereís very much statistical

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:32.970
significance because itís been designed by
our ecologists.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:39.830
Then youíll be swimming transects for several
hours, moving around a few times, we do catch

00:38:39.830 --> 00:38:40.830
the turtles.

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:45.660
Youíre not required, because it is a physically
difficult thing to catch the turtles, but

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:50.800
we do catch them and if you do we will tag
them and we will have several, one if not

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.110
two, satellite tags that weíre hoping to
put on if we get the appropriately aged turtle,

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.760
so afterwards you build a follow.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:39:01.730
Thereís a website called seaturtle dot org
which freely allows you to monitor turtles.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:06.580
So hopefully if things all go well and weíll
have one we can tag with a satellite receiver

00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:08.840
and be able to track after the trip.

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:10.150
Then youíll come home.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:14.940
So youíll just have had breakfast, be out
for up to 4 hours, come home for lunch and

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.940
then the afternoon would be yours.

00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.620
There is, not extremely high speed Wi-Fi,
but there is some Wi-Fi.

00:39:20.620 --> 00:39:23.700
I wouldnít expect anyone that does a lot
of modeling or anything like that would be

00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:29.030
able to do that through the internet, but
you would have some communication.

00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:31.940
And that part of the day would be a bit of
a break.

00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:35.460
Weíve got a great Belizean, our whole team
that youíre gonna be working with is a Belizean

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:36.510
team.

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:42.560
Our team leader, Robin Coleman is a PhD ecologist
from Belize and a champion for conservation

00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.560
there.

00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:47.730
And a whole set of the Belizean fishery staff
will be with you and we have about five permanent

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.640
staff at this station who will be serving
you food, maybe as good as we ate today at

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.730
Google, I donít know, those of you that go
can tell us, but great solid Belizean food

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:01.000
to make sure that you donít waste away when
youíre out there.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Does that help?

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
&gt;&gt;Female #1: Yes.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
&gt;&gt; Caleb McClennon: Okay.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Yeah?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.810
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So you mentioned that Argentina
is more about salsa and beef than oceans.

00:40:07.810 --> 00:40:08.810
[Laughter]

00:40:08.810 --> 00:40:09.810
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Tango.

00:40:09.810 --> 00:40:10.810
Tango.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:11.810
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Oh right

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:12.810
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Yeah.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:17.400
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Um but that this new reserve had
been created, in the Southern part of the

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:22.030
ocean, does that, do you perceive that thereís
a sea change going on that the people, the

00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:23.320
leadership are bringing more there and accelerating?

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.780
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Yes.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:30.980
Very much, the head of the National Parks
of Argentina today, Patricia Gandini is a

00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.270
person that understands the ocean.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:42.800
She has been working with WCS for a long time,
she has a PhD, do work on penguins and she

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:48.550
has been facilitating the process of creating,
not just national parks, but many interjurisdictional

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:52.130
areas and I think that makes a difference.

00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:54.960
Leadership, again, she understands that.

00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:00.380
Patriciaís boss, actually, is a minister
of the tourism in Argentina and he understands

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.710
protected areas, very, very much.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:08.670
And I think that we have some political will
there that is aligned and is very important.

00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:14.090
Peninsula Valdes, which is one of the most
beautiful places on the coast of Patagonia,

00:41:14.090 --> 00:41:20.890
the person in charge of Peninsula Valdes,
[unclear] who is a secretary of tourism, is

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:27.930
a conservationist and is part of an NGO that
I help create with her and other WCS people.

00:41:27.930 --> 00:41:32.670
So things are happening because the Indonesians,
now, are in the right positions to make things

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:36.760
happen and the Argentines are very sensitive.

00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:41.200
If, the sooner they are being informed about
an issue they respond.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.920
They donít want the penguins to be killed;
they donít want the penguins to be oil they

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:45.920
worry.

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:51.560
So I think itís a community that historically
has not been very much trained to watch the

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.020
ocean but is very easily trained.

00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.800
&gt;&gt;Male #1: One more question.

00:41:55.800 --> 00:42:01.910
This is kind of a softball but what, beyond
coming and counting turtles, what can we as

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:08.160
people who care about the ocean, do to affect
change around the world and save the biodiversity

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.160
of the oceans.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.170
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: You can help the NGOs
that are doing ocean conservation, no, this

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.410
is more than that, itís much more.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:16.720
There are many, many things that you can do.

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.590
First, youíre a consumer of ocean products,
even if you donít want; you are, in some

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:22.590
ways or another.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:25.380
Be a responsible consumer.

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:30.850
Be aware that many fisheries are not sustainable
and that many species should not be consumed.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:36.410
Itís very easy to find Chilean sea bass here
and you have to be aware of that.

00:42:36.410 --> 00:42:44.960
Itís very easy to find shrimp in any cocktail,
you should be careful about that because shrimp

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:47.480
causes a very high bycatch.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:52.790
In some places of the world, one pound of
shrimp, one kilo of shrimp results in ten

00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:57.900
kilo of diversity that is being thrown away
because it has no commercial value.

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:02.200
So as a consumer you could really, really
do a lot.

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:06.060
You can also spread the word.

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:09.470
You have seen the finning problem, shark problem.

00:43:09.470 --> 00:43:12.110
The world does not necessarily know much about
that.

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:15.970
Youíre educated people, you know that, but
many people donít.

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:23.430
Be sure that you talk you integrate conservation
in your everyday discourse.

00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:33.360
Youíre, you know, as Caleb was saying today
[inaudible], itís a castle of; itís an intellectual

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:38.960
paradise that would, that is a communication
paradise.

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:44.110
Make sure that the world knows that there
is an ocean there and that the ocean requires

00:43:44.110 --> 00:43:46.310
our support.

00:43:46.310 --> 00:43:51.950
Many people of the world believe that the
ocean is an exhaustible, I mean, cannot be

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:57.320
used up, thatís a wrong perception, we need
to change that.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.960
You could help develop technological tools.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:08.890
For example, to map areas or to create, to
analyze, to do spatial analysis, zoning, so

00:44:08.890 --> 00:44:12.260
you can contribute with the technical aspects
of it.

00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:16.210
You can educate your children, your friends;
thatís extremely important.

00:44:16.210 --> 00:44:21.980
You could be part of some of our expeditions
and some of our work.

00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:25.080
Get involved in really obtaining the information.

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:30.770
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: I should add that on Google
ocean layers, that Google has supported, Claudioís

00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.700
site is one of the first participants in providing

00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.700
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Yeah.

00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:35.780
&gt;&gt; Caleb McClennon: So there has been ways
that weíve worked together as well.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.950
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: So and today I was just
coming and all of a sudden we say [inaudible].

00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:44.660
So the community of Google is sensitive to
the ocean.

00:44:44.660 --> 00:44:46.690
I was very gladly surprised.

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:51.070
And of course Google brain could change the
world in the way we see the ocean.

00:44:51.070 --> 00:44:53.320
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Any other questions?

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.320
Yeah?

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:55.320
Stay here.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Oh.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:45:00.220
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I was wondering how you decided
when, how much of your effort to put on protecting

00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.410
the deep sea versus the coastline?

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:10.250
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Most of my life I dedicated
to doing work that was helpful for coastal

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:11.920
protection, thatís what I did.

00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:17.060
And today the WCS in Argentina is still doing
that and in the Southern Cone because we also

00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:19.130
work in Chile very much.

00:45:19.130 --> 00:45:23.460
You know, there are some areas of Chile that
are extraordinary as coastal areas.

00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.650
The Fjords of Chile are unique.

00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:28.400
You donít find those places in any other
place in the world.

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:34.770
So many, many people, most people, most of
the effort that we put there is about coastal

00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:36.500
conservation still today.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:38.570
It is required.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:48.360
A proportion of us have the courage to move
away from that specific need into another

00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.540
perspective for which we did not have a big
market.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:57.440
People were understanding that the coasts
had to be protected because you see the coast.

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:02.320
You donít see the ocean and you donít see
the depth, the deep ocean.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:07.800
I have been leading what is called a Sea and
Sky Project, the name is suggesting that the

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:13.610
way I think about the ocean and the sky, I
do think about the coast, of course, but Iím

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:18.890
trying to promote these ideas of the deep
ocean protection, around the ocean protection.

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:21.420
For me itís most of the work that I do.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:25.650
For the organization, itís a proportion of
that work that we what we do.

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:32.240
The open ocean has many problems as you might
know, one is jurisdictional.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:38.040
Countries have a decision on the first two
hundred miles and there they could determine

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.960
whoís coming whoís leaving what is being
done.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:46.060
Beyond the two hundred miles itís the commons,
itís everybody owns it.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:51.080
There are some laws but it is very difficult
to enforce whatís going on.

00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:54.790
And fisheries today are moving into that realm.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.630
Theyíre moving into international waters.

00:46:58.630 --> 00:47:03.080
There are a group of people, and we are part
of that, alliances of organization that are

00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.760
trying, organizations, that are trying to
understand what can be done to protect the

00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:10.330
international waters.

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:13.990
And a few things are being done and a few
places must be protected.

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:16.040
For example, sea mounds.

00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:21.430
The sea mounds are very, are places deep in
the ocean that are unique because you have

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:24.040
a flat ocean and all of a sudden you have
something like that.

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:29.760
And that creates particular very sensitive
places where you have a biodiversity that

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:32.370
is only there.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.570
Those sea mounds are being fished.

00:47:35.570 --> 00:47:40.390
So we need to protect them and there is a
strong effort into trying to do that because

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:45.480
we donít even know the species that are there.

00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:50.840
So, as an answer is, most of the work still
requires to be done on the coast.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:59.660
Thatís a must, but a few of us itís sustainable
if a portion of us will move into the more

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.360
challenging, more experimental phases.

00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:09.730
But those experimental phases have to be turned
into, not that experimental, but into something

00:48:09.730 --> 00:48:14.750
more tangible very soon otherwise itís very
easy to destroy this small environment like

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:15.750
a sea mound.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:18.380
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Did that, does it answer?

00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.630
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Yes.

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:21.600
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Okay, any other questions?

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.720
Yeah, go ahead.

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.960
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Uh, Claudio a question.

00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.070
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Yeah.

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:35.097
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Is the trip restricted to Google
employees or what about qualified friends?

00:48:35.097 --> 00:48:38.900
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: For the moment, uh, if
you sign up itís restricted to Google employees

00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:43.240
just cause currently, from what Iím understanding
of demand, we have more than 8 from Google

00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.660
so we like to keep it that way.

00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:49.260
But if you are signing up and would like to
make a note that if it doesnít fill up weíd

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:56.240
like to bring someone as well we can open
up that question if itís possible.

00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:57.760
&gt;&gt; Female: [Inaudible]

00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.510
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Sheís the boss so yes,
there you go.

00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:02.510
[Laughs]

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:06.260
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: I should say, cause I notice
a couple people are leaving, we had you stay

00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:09.600
til the end of the hour for questions but
if itís not apparent, I think it will be

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:26.340

to plan their personal lives cause itís the

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:27.930
last week in April.

00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:33.620

We have a couple more minutes for, uh, if
thereís anything Iím missing just from folks?

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:43.520
Okay.

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.750
We have two more minutes for people and then
weíll take casual questions after.

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:49.950
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Let me just say one thing
more about your question about what you can

00:49:49.950 --> 00:49:50.950
do.

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:55.600
Letís be in touch, letís talk because thereís
some things that people have to understand

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.600
about what they want to do.

00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.600
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Yeah.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:00.100
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: And we can help guide
that.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:05.110
So I just gave you a general understanding
but, you know, if you want to talk about that

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:08.530
Iím very open to discuss it with you and
everybody.

00:50:08.530 --> 00:50:15.270
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Is the political tension between
the Argentina and the Falkland Islands proving

00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:18.080
to be challenging or do people find ways to
work around.

00:50:18.080 --> 00:50:19.080
&gt;&gt;Claudio Campagna: Yes.

00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:20.080
It is.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:21.080
It is.

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:26.900
The war between the UK and Argentina in 1982
was unfortunate.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:34.290
It is a problem that you can analyze from
many different perspectives.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:39.560
Certainly the political perspective is not
my place to analyze that problem.

00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:47.760
I could speak as an individual but from a
conservation perspective it is a pity that

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:54.500
that happened cause now all of a sudden one
ocean is being seen from many different perspectives

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:56.150
and that does not help.

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:59.390
Cause the ocean does not work like that.

00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:05.500
So countries have to make decisions on a regional
level and a very large level.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:13.510
That problem is creating some issues some
dialogue has been interrupted.

00:51:13.510 --> 00:51:17.630
And now there are some developments that are
taking place in the Islands that Argentines

00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:22.840
donít decide about and thatís causing clearly
tension.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:31.350
I had the hope, I mean I have it, that perhaps
the conservation perspective has an umbrella

00:51:31.350 --> 00:51:35.210
that embraces that problem and puts that into
perspective.

00:51:35.210 --> 00:51:38.740
But it has to, we need time.

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:40.570
And yes, it has been a problem.

00:51:40.570 --> 00:51:45.690
And for us has been a challenge to think in
the open ocean considering that situation,

00:51:45.690 --> 00:51:47.390
that jurisdictional issue.

00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:49.580
&gt;&gt;Caleb McClennon: Alright.

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.540
Well, thank you so much everyone.

00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.400
Thanks to Winnie for being our host, we really
appreciate and look forward to talking to

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.560
you each individually or afterwards.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:59.320
And thank you from WCS to Google and look
forward to working together.

00:51:59.320 --> 00:51:59.500
[Applause]
