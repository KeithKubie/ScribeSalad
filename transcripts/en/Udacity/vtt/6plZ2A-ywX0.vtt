00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.564
People often throw around the term bipolar without really understanding what it

00:00:03.564 --> 00:00:08.850
means, or what it's like to live with bipolar disorder. For example, people may

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.970
call someone bipolar, just because they change moods during a stressful day.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.978
Check out these options, and tell me why you think it's inappropriate to call

00:00:16.978 --> 00:00:21.060
this person bipolar. Choose as many as you think apply.
