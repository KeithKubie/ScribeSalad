00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.859
what if our whole idea of time, based on seconds,
and extended to years and millennia is just

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.859
wrong.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.530
WHAT IF EVERYTHING WE KNOW IS WRONG.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.200
Hey Guys Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.950
Just trying not to freak out over here.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.400
Our system of time seems so inevitable.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.150
Like math, it just seems to be out there in
the universe waiting to be put into words

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.150
by humans.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.579
But not really.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.150
Ancient cultures just kind of made it up.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.980
A variety of ancient cultures used different
bases for systems of counting.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.630
Like the metric system is a base 10 system.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.090
Which makes sense, most of us have ten fingers
to count on.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.300
But other systems were just as widely used.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.179
Like the duodecimal system which uses 12 as
a base.

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.690
Maybe 12 became such an important number because
it takes 12 lunar cycles to make one trip

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.289
around the sun or maybe even more basic than
that.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:52.570
Rather than counting fingers, maybe people
counted knuckles with their thumbs.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.070
Or maybe blame the stars.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.739
Some cultures used to keep track of time by
the sky.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.530
The ancient Egyptians used sundials during
the day and divided the day into 12 parts.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.949
But at night, they found 36 stars that seemed
to divide the night sky into equal parts.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.310
They called these decans.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.800
There were 18 stars that would appear throughout
the night, but some appeared during dawn or

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.800
dusk.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.110
So at true night, there would 12 decans, appearing
almost 40 minutes apart.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.660
Eventually this was standardized so days and
nights each had 12 hours.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.860
But only on equinoxes were those hours equal.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.580
Throughout the seasons the length of an hour
would change.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.710
During winter, night time hours would be longer,
and daytime hours were shorter.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
It really wasn’t until the mechanization
of clocks in the 1300s did hours become fixed.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.820
But how did an hour get divided into 60 units?

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.930
Well blame the Ancient Babylonians or probably
the Sumerians.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.000
Over 4,000 years ago, they worked on a base
60 system of counting.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.860
Why they picked a base 60 system is a bit
of a mystery, maybe by counting five fingers

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.560
on one hand and counting the 12 knuckles on
the other.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.620
And 60 is good for breaking down into fractions.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.009
Who knows.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.500
But what’s also important, they divided
circles into 360 parts.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.320
Ancient Greek astronomers built on these models.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.000
They tried to measure the Earth by them.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.060
They divided the Earth into 360 parts in a
kind of latitude and longitudinal lines.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.050
Claudius Ptolemy divided these parts into
smaller parts which he called first minute.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:13.030
Then those parts were divided into 60 smaller
parts called "second minute," which became

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.670
the second.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.340
But minutes and seconds weren’t really used
for timekeeping until better mechanical clocks

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.720
arrived on the scene in the 16th century.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.490
Fast forward a few centuries and now we have
even better timekeeping.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.150
We’ve got the atomic clock.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.690
It measures a second by 9,192,631,770 energy
transitions of the cesium atom.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.950
But this Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)
doesn’t always match up to astrological

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.640
time since Earth’s rotation is slowing down.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.960
So sometimes, around 8 times every decade,
a second has to be added to a minute!

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.620
Eventually, more seconds will need to be added
more often.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.380
In another century we’ll have to add 2 seconds
a year!

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:54.380
Well what do you think?

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.790
What if we switched to a decimal time system,
where everything is based on ten, like the

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.170
Ancient Chinese used or like some people during
the French Revolution wanted?

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.320
HOW CRAZY WOULD THAT BE
