cultures that have been influenced by us
 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.190
cultures that have been influenced by us
and in other cultures we find arranged

approach and that really isn't romantic

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860
approach and that really isn't romantic
 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.850
approach and that really isn't romantic
love but we found that even in cultures

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860
love but we found that even in cultures
 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.690
love but we found that even in cultures
with very strict arranged marriage norms

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700
with very strict arranged marriage norms
 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.540
with very strict arranged marriage norms
for example we would find elopements we

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550
for example we would find elopements we
 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.510
for example we would find elopements we
would find suicides / unrequited love we

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520
would find suicides / unrequited love we
 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.970
would find suicides / unrequited love we
would find love poetry so even in these

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980
would find love poetry so even in these
 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.730
would find love poetry so even in these

is romantic love

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.010
 
and I would actually say in our own

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:06.020
and I would actually say in our own
