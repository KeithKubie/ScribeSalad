I remember that movie monsters ball, not my says balled up monster,

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.230
where they literally turned a serial killer into this sympathetic fucking

3
00:00:10.231 --> 00:00:15.170
person. I just didn't, you know? Yeah. He had a rough childhood. You know,

4
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.750
you got molested, you know who didn't go write some fucking jokes.

5
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.080
You don't get a gun and start shooting fucking people. And if you do,

6
00:00:24.081 --> 00:00:25.790
you go to jail. That'll happen.

7
00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.870
But that movie was the worst fucking movie ever with those cartoon character,

8
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.290
male characters that they had in that. Did you see if you remember that part?

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.530
When she goes into apply for the law office job or something,

10
00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.410
she comes in there looking like this strung off hooker,

11
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:43.340
and somehow she's not ushered right out of the fucking office.

12
00:00:43.341 --> 00:00:48.290
She actually gets in to the lawyer's office and he's just like,

13
00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:52.370
let me tell you something. You fucking skank. You don't get to say,

14
00:00:52.371 --> 00:00:55.430
you know what I think now I'd like to have what everybody else has worked their

15
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:58.730
entire life for. It doesn't work that way. I really hated that fucking movie.
