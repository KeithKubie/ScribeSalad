1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:05,970
Okay. So as we move from
radical to ionic reactions,

2
00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:10,410
Homo Lumo reactions, uh, we have
to take into account salvation.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:12,840
So do they will do that.
And h bonding,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,930
talk about Ayana fours
and Bruns debt acidity.

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:20,610
We might begin nuclear
fillic substitution first.

6
00:00:20,611 --> 00:00:24,780
The answer to that puzzle that, that
we had for homework last time. Uh,

7
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:28,440
the question is how you get to
the Aldehyde from the alcohol, uh,

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:31,730
by free radical chain
substitution reaction.

9
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:35,430
And you remember that you had a
substitute the hydrogen with the chlorine,

10
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:39,730
you know how to do that. And then it was,
and then if you have a base around it,

11
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,370
it doesn't have to be a strong base.

12
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:46,670
You can pull off the Proton and lose the
chlorine chloride simultaneously in an

13
00:00:47,311 --> 00:00:49,550
elimination reaction to
generate the carbon eel.

14
00:00:49,551 --> 00:00:53,400
And I think a lot of people got that and
notice that those things happen at the

15
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:58,401
same time that the departure
of the chloride opens up
a Lumo that helps take the

16
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:02,220
electrons from the Oah bond.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,540
So the Oah bond is weakened by
the fact of the chloride leaving.

18
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,520
So all those things are happening at once.

19
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,660
And we'll talk more when we get to
elimination reactions about the timing of

20
00:01:12,661 --> 00:01:15,660
that process. Okay. Uh,

21
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:19,470
so the base that removes the
Proton could be a very weak base.

22
00:01:19,471 --> 00:01:21,780
It could be just the
unshared pair of an alcohol,

23
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,800
or even have a by sulfite
by sulfite an ion.

24
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,920
Now that might not be the way it
actually happens in 30% sulfuric acid.

25
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,140
So I asked you to think
of another mechanism,

26
00:01:34,141 --> 00:01:37,560
one involving Homo lumos substitution.
So the question is,

27
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:39,480
what's the homo and what's the Lumo?

28
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,960
So the homos and unshared bear on the
alcohol and the Lumo is the sigma star of

29
00:01:45,151 --> 00:01:46,950
the nitrogen chlorine bond,

30
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:51,270
which is especially a low because of the
positive charge on the nitrogen. Okay.

31
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:56,271
So we can do a substitution
reaction and this will then,

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:02:00,610
uh, uh, uh, put the chlorine on to, um,

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,650
to the alcohol. The positive
charge you're going to get rid of,

34
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:08,820
which you can just do by the amine
that was generated in the same process.

35
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:11,240
It can take off the proton.
Okay.

36
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,150
Which you notice as a substitution
reaction that hydrogen, uh,

37
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,430
substituting nitrogen in place
of oxygen on the hydrogen. Okay.

38
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,150
So then we have,
uh,

39
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,200
the same compound as above except the
hydrogen and the chlorine or exchanged in

40
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,470
their position. So you can do the
same thing again, bring in a base,

41
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,260
pull off the Proton and lose the chloride.

42
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,540
Now you don't usually think of basis
taking protons off from normal carbon

43
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:43,680
atoms, but this isn't a normal carbon
atom because the chlorides leaving.

44
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,530
So there's something that can
take the electrons as you,

45
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,170
as the base pulls the Proton off.

46
00:02:49,171 --> 00:02:53,340
So the same kind of elimination just
backwards gives the same product.

47
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,700
So that was the mechanisms that I
was hoping you might be able to see.

48
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,350
So in the lecture we were talking about
what holds molecules together other than

49
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,240
bonding,
right about non bonded interactions.

50
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,940
And those are visible in the
physical properties of the ALC.

51
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,110
Yohe lights in the boiling point
and now Keynes do anything,

52
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:15,370
any liquid for that matter.

53
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,910
So we looked last time and saw that the
dipole dipole interaction could hold

54
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:23,680
[inaudible] together.
Right?

55
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:29,070
But that can't be all it is because that
gets large and then get small again.

56
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:31,570
And the boiling points
keep going up all the time.

57
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:32,920
So there must be something else.

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,510
And that something else is polarizability
the fact that if you have a lot of

59
00:03:37,511 --> 00:03:42,511
electrons and they're far out and high
and orbitals so that they're easily

60
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:47,080
sloshed around, right?
That is, it's polarizable.

61
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:51,460
Then you can have interactions between
the dipole and something that gets

62
00:03:51,461 --> 00:03:56,461
polarized by the dipole or indeed
between two instantaneous dipoles.

63
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,200
Uh, and we see that,
uh, that iodide here is,

64
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:04,060
is much more polarizable than fluoride.

65
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,370
So that's the other mechanism that's
holding the molecules together under, uh,

66
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,010
that is between molecules,

67
00:04:12,011 --> 00:04:15,760
the bonding between molecules
than non bonded interactions.

68
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:17,380
And then we said last time,

69
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:22,381
let's look at hydrocarbons and see what
they tell us at butane and isobutane,

70
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:26,350
neo pentane and pente normal Ben Dane.

71
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:30,760
So here are the boiling points
for end butane and isobutane.

72
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,150
And you see that as you
make it a more branched,

73
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:38,530
it's an isomer at the same Adams,
right? But as you make it more branched,

74
00:04:38,770 --> 00:04:42,790
the, uh, the, uh, boiling
point goes down, right?

75
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:46,210
It's easier to pull the molecules
apart to make them in the gas phase.

76
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,130
The same thing is true of pentane normal
pentane go down eight degrees to get

77
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:54,960
the ISO Pentane and Neo Pentane goes down,
uh,

78
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:57,490
by another 18 degrees,
right?

79
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,880
So polarizability does its job well
only when things are close together,

80
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:09,310
right? Remember that's one over r to the
end dependence. So it falls off rapidly.

81
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:14,200
The energy you can get from this. So if
you have the same Adams, for example,

82
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:18,010
here in, in, uh, in normal pentane.

83
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,930
So we got five in a row,

84
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,760
we have to get the atoms close together
to allow their polarizability to hold

85
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,920
the molecules together.
So with these,

86
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:29,200
you can put them side by
side and that's great.

87
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:33,580
And all the atoms in one molecule or
near all the atoms in another molecule.

88
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:39,390
But if it's a branched
compound like neo pentane here,

89
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:43,840
where the four of methyl
groups are on the same Adam,

90
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:49,130
then you can't get them nearly as close
to one another. For purposes of, of, uh,

91
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:54,810
of having the polarizability do the trick
and we have a picture here so that you

92
00:05:55,991 --> 00:05:58,950
can see it better on the next slide.
Uh,

93
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:03,410
so it's atoms that are near the surface
of the molecule that count atoms that

94
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:05,450
are deep down inside a molecule,

95
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,440
don't get close enough to their
neighbors to profit from this very much.

96
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,800
So there's an above and Pentane
and below neo pentane right?

97
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,320
And here you can see how much closer you
can get the molecules and if you'd like

98
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:21,800
to see whether you can get them closer
than I suggested and holding here,

99
00:06:21,801 --> 00:06:25,430
I'll pass these around and you can
hold them and have a good time.

100
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,293
Yeah.

101
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,520
Okay.

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,200
Now you can see something a little bit
like that in the heat of formation,

103
00:06:36,201 --> 00:06:38,030
the stability of the molecules.

104
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:43,220
Notice that the heat of formation of
Neo Pentane is larger, more negative,

105
00:06:43,221 --> 00:06:47,330
more downhill to form neo
Dane than to form an Pentane.

106
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,550
And that's it.

107
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:54,610
Part of that must be the same reason that
the polarizability can operate within

108
00:06:55,581 --> 00:07:00,110
a molecule as well as between molecules.
And when you get all the atoms,

109
00:07:00,111 --> 00:07:03,290
not to be spread out,
but to be more in a ball,

110
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,860
then the Addams within the
molecule or near one another.

111
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,820
So what you lose in terms of
polarizability from molecule,

112
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,180
from one molecule at a,
at being adjacent to another one,

113
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:17,600
you gain in interactions
within the molecule.

114
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,970
So that's not the only reason for this,

115
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:23,990
but that's one reason that
branching is more stable,

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,820
makes molecules more stable.

117
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:31,030
So it's like salvation except that
happens within the molecule rather than

118
00:07:31,641 --> 00:07:34,580
between molecules.
And you can see the thing,

119
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:39,610
the same principle in a more pronounced
way when there's an actual charge to do

120
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:43,820
the polarizing, right? So if
we look here at the gas phase,

121
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:45,380
ionic dissociation,

122
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:49,760
so how much energy does it take to break
a chloride away from our to make our

123
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:54,140
plus. So we look at the stability,
the end of the r plus cad ion,

124
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:59,060
and you can see that it's ever
so much easier. 53 kilocalories.

125
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,990
It easier to make tea butyl
than it is to make methyl.

126
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,170
Now there are a number of factors that
are involved there and we're going to

127
00:08:06,171 --> 00:08:07,970
discuss others as well.

128
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,990
But one of the factors is certainly
that the positive charge, stable gain,

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,450
stability by polarizing the material
that's around it and the more material you

130
00:08:17,451 --> 00:08:20,240
have around it,
the closer to the positive charge,

131
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,980
the more stability you're going to get.

132
00:08:21,981 --> 00:08:25,730
So that's one of the factors that's
involved here. It's not the only factor,

133
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:28,880
but this interim molecular salvation,

134
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,620
I mean that's sort of
a stupid thing to say,

135
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,970
but that must be one of the factors
that helps explain these trends.

136
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:36,710
Yeah.

137
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:40,100
Now here we look at the boiling points
of the normal alkanes with different

138
00:08:40,101 --> 00:08:43,010
chain lengths and halogen on the end

139
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,330
or in the first case,
hydrogen.

140
00:08:48,331 --> 00:08:52,800
So here and alkanes has hydrogen on the
end of the chain. Then Khloe fluoride,

141
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:57,090
chloride, bromide iodide. This
is a from from the textbook,

142
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,800
the Jones Textbook.

143
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:04,200
And here we see them a colored a so you
can see what Adam's involved, right?

144
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:08,340
So one would infer from this that
for some reason, I mean just the,

145
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:13,341
the impression it makes on me as a viewer
is that something suggests that the

146
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,640
iodides are low boiling.
Do you see what I'm saying?

147
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,160
That curve falls below the others.
But what does,

148
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,540
what does molecular weight have
to do with boiling point notice?

149
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,110
What's being plotted here is molecular
weight against boiling point.

150
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,300
But what relevance does molecular
weight have to boiling point? Yeah.

151
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,090
There's sort of an intuitive
idea that if something's heavy,

152
00:09:39,091 --> 00:09:43,590
it's hard to get up in the gas
phase. Right? But that's, that's,

153
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:48,150
that has nothing to do with boiling
point, right? That's a pure nonsense.

154
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:53,310
The question is, is there a better way
to plot this to see what's going on?

155
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,110
And I think there is,

156
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:59,400
which is instead of plotted against the
molecular weight plot against the length

157
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:03,950
of the chain, right? How big is
the molecule? So if we do that too.

158
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:08,400
So we plot in here in Hch to
take an end times and then x,

159
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:13,710
and now we'll change x from hydrogen to
fluorine, chlorine, bromine, to then,

160
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,630
okay, now fluorine is almost
the same as hydrogen, right?

161
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,510
When it's a really short chain,
the fluoride is a little bit like,

162
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:26,430
that's methyl fluoride,
that's higher boiling and hydrogen,

163
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:31,431
we already explained that the dipoles
that are in the ch three f can interact

164
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:36,270
with one another in a favorable way,
okay. But once you get a real long chain,

165
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,820
that's not a very big
fraction of the total.

166
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:41,930
And it comes to look pretty
much like the alkanes.

167
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,910
But now look what happens
if you go instead of, uh,

168
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,530
so the dipole moment is
bigger for fluoride than it
is for the hydrogen, right?

169
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:53,130
But the polarize abilities
or about the same, right?

170
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,790
But if it chloride is more polarizable,

171
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:59,490
it has more electrons further out.
Right?

172
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:03,870
So although it has essentially the
same dipole moment is the fluoride,

173
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,580
it's polarizability,

174
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:08,820
it's a greater polarizability as
clearly holding things together.

175
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,640
And the same thing is true
when you go on to bromide,

176
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:14,550
which is still more
polarizable and to iodide,

177
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:16,710
which is the most polarizable at all.

178
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,160
So it has sort of backhand way,

179
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:24,330
it's related to molecular weight because
the more electrons you have in the Adam,

180
00:11:24,331 --> 00:11:26,640
the further out they are,
the more they slosh around,

181
00:11:26,641 --> 00:11:28,200
the more polarizable they are.

182
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,610
But the electrons have
nothing to do with the weight.

183
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,670
It's the nucleus that has
to do with the weight,

184
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:36,900
but more electrons mean more neutrons
and more protons in the nucleus.

185
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,460
So it's sort of parallel,

186
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,190
but I think it's more informative
to look at it this way,

187
00:11:41,191 --> 00:11:46,020
to see what it is that's really
holding the molecules together. Okay.

188
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:50,160
Now you've heard the, the
ancient say like dissolves, like,

189
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:55,420
and you've seen things like soup
that has clubs of the, of the fat,

190
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,930
uh, floating around into
obviously not mixing with water.

191
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,740
Uh, and you've heard tell of
solid though. PHOBIC forces,

192
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,930
probably hydrophobic forces.
So the, so there seems to be,

193
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:12,800
the name implies it antagonism
between water and, and uh,

194
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,450
al Qaeda in the grease, right?
That tends to push them apart.

195
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:20,140
So you've got islands of Greece
and in a matrix of water,

196
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:25,840
uh,
now here's droplets of mercury on a,

197
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:30,460
on a cover slip on glass.
And you can see that the mercury beads up,

198
00:12:30,461 --> 00:12:32,770
it doesn't spread out.
And what the glass,

199
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,850
so it seems that mercury
doesn't wet glass, right?

200
00:12:36,851 --> 00:12:41,851
So there seems to be a phobic
force between glass and
mercury that tends to push

201
00:12:42,581 --> 00:12:45,130
them apart to keep them
separate from one another.

202
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:50,290
And here we see droplets of mercury in a,
in a polyethylene,

203
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,610
a container.

204
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:56,110
And you can see that it beads up that
mercury doesn't wet hydrocarbon either.

205
00:12:56,140 --> 00:13:00,040
So it looks like they are
antagonistic to one another. Right?

206
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,170
And the same thing is true of water.

207
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:06,850
Water doesn't wet a waxed car or,
or a hydrocarbon,

208
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:11,620
right? That's, that's, that's hydrophobic
forces. That's like the, the grease.

209
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:16,510
They stay apart right now if
that's so can you tell me,

210
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:20,890
should mercury repel uh,
water?

211
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:23,143
Okay.

212
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:29,000
So if we touch a drop of
water to a drop of mercury,

213
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:33,800
should they stay apart as beads or
should they spread on each other?

214
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:43,790
How many of you think they should
be antagonistic and fan form beads?

215
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,060
Okay.

216
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,890
Okay. How many think they should
spread on one another? It's a, well,

217
00:13:50,891 --> 00:13:54,430
there's a slight slight excess there,
but pretty close to a tie.

218
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:56,800
And I think there are a number
of individuals not voting,

219
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,520
so we can do the experiment,
right?

220
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,490
See how the water comes over
and grabs onto the Burke Uri.

221
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:08,590
So clearly there's an affinity
between mercury and water, right?

222
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,330
But in fact,

223
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,600
there's also affinity between mercury
and glass and there's affinity between Al

224
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,080
Alkane and, and, and water, right? This,

225
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:25,060
it's a misleading term to say phobic, that
these things are avoiding one another,

226
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:29,410
right? Clearly, mercury
attracts water, right?

227
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,390
But al and water or mercury in
glass don't repel one another.

228
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,590
There's attraction between
them as you expect. There's,

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,210
there's going to be the Po,
if nothing else,

230
00:14:40,211 --> 00:14:44,680
they'll be the mutual polarization of
one atom by another across this boundary

231
00:14:44,681 --> 00:14:47,050
that will tend to hold things together,
right?

232
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,650
But Mercury is particularly good.

233
00:14:50,651 --> 00:14:53,840
It has so many electrons out
there that could be polarizable.

234
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:58,610
Mercury holds to mercury very,
very tightly and water,

235
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:02,810
uh, likes to be near water
for hydrogen bonding,

236
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:05,660
which is what we're going to cost.
But water likes to be near Mercury,

237
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:10,400
but not as much as mercury
likes to be near Mercury. Okay?

238
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:14,960
So water with mercury is a
good interaction from the
point of view of the water.

239
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:17,960
The water's the dipole.
The mercury has polarizable.

240
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,120
There's good attraction there,
right?

241
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,850
But Mercury doesn't want
to change its shape.

242
00:15:22,851 --> 00:15:26,930
It wants to have as many mercury
Adams as close together as possible.

243
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,800
It's like the owl cane,
right? The Neo Pentane, they,

244
00:15:30,801 --> 00:15:33,560
Adam's want to be close to one
another to be low in energy.

245
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:38,300
So you don't want to distort mercury
because it has so much attraction between

246
00:15:38,301 --> 00:15:39,590
the atoms,
but water,

247
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:43,340
it attracts mercury better
than it attracts itself.

248
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:48,110
So it spreads out on the mercury.
So these, these, these salvo,

249
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:50,170
phobic forces are not really questioned.

250
00:15:50,171 --> 00:15:53,390
The things being antagonistic
to one another. There's a,

251
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,140
that's a question of something
really wanting to be close to itself.

252
00:15:57,141 --> 00:16:01,350
For some particular reason. Mercury
with mercury is very good, uh,

253
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,270
attraction,

254
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:06,890
but water with water to
water will attract a Greece.

255
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:11,270
Right?
But it attracts itself much better.

256
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,940
So it wants to stay connected to itself.

257
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,910
Okay. And this brings up the question of
what is it that holds water to itself.

258
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:23,030
And of course we heard last
time about hydrogen bonding.

259
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,440
So let's think about why hydrogen bonding.
So water has a dipole,

260
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:30,620
so you can imagine that two of
them would line up this way,

261
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,260
positive to negative the dipoles.

262
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,800
But actually this is the calculated dimer
structure for water calculated in 2000

263
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:44,480
water gets worked on so much
and it's been worked on forever.

264
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:48,380
Anybody that has a theoretical
technique tries to do it with water.

265
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:51,500
And the main thing is that
although they hold together,

266
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:53,630
they don't hold together very strongly.

267
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:58,130
The dimerization energy is only about
three kilocalories per mole, right?

268
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,690
And it, there's a lot of flexibility
in it because it's rather weak.

269
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:07,070
But the very lowest energy according to
this particular calculation is this one.

270
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,870
Now, what is it that's holding
there? There's a hydrogen
between the two oxygens.

271
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:15,020
The hydrogen of one of the molecules
is between the two oxygens.

272
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,700
But let's look at the bond distances.
There's 95 pico meters.

273
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,700
That's 0.95 angst drums,
right?

274
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:28,220
And same over here on the left,
but the bridging one is nine six,

275
00:17:28,221 --> 00:17:31,400
three, 9.96. Well, it's longer,

276
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:34,970
but it's not much longer, right? So the,

277
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,630
it's lengthened by only 0.5%.
Okay?

278
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:43,880
So there's not much electron
pair from one oxygen, uh,

279
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,430
donating into sigma star of the other one.

280
00:17:46,431 --> 00:17:49,710
That's what you would expect
for a bond, right? It has,

281
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:53,120
it has lengthened the
bond to the hydrogen. Uh,

282
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,760
now how would you expect
the, the, the, uh,

283
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:01,200
waters to line up according to their,
we looked at the charge last time,

284
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:03,330
the dipole,
but it's not waters,

285
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,780
just the positive charge here in a
negative charge here at a certain distance

286
00:18:06,781 --> 00:18:10,470
from one another. The electrons are
spread all out with different densities.

287
00:18:10,471 --> 00:18:14,700
So you can analyze it as multiples,
not only a dipole moment,

288
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,110
but also a quadrupole moment,
which is plus, plus, minus, minus,

289
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,580
and an octopus and a hex indexical moment.
This is hard to do in your head,

290
00:18:23,850 --> 00:18:28,580
but one thing you can do with, with a
spartan or other graphic pro pro, uh,

291
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:33,800
programs is draw this
electrostatic surface potential
that we've talked about to

292
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:37,020
see where on the surface
of Proton would be happy.

293
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,360
That's where it's red or unhappy,

294
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:43,140
where it's blue and the
energies are minus 47,

295
00:18:43,141 --> 00:18:46,110
very favorable in the
blue area to plus 60.

296
00:18:46,111 --> 00:18:51,000
Very unfavorable in the red area
for a proton at the surface. Okay?

297
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:55,020
Now let's look at the, uh, at the one
on the right there and let's rotate it.

298
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:59,280
So we site right along the h
o bond, right? And if we look,

299
00:18:59,281 --> 00:19:03,480
we see that it's blue. They're a good
place to, a bad place to put a proton,

300
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,240
a good place to put something negative,
right?

301
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,310
And this is the color scale here it goes.
Instead of minus 47 to 60,

302
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,920
while this is minus 45 to 60,
right?

303
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:18,921
But we can home in audit to get the colors
to show what we want by going plus 55

304
00:19:19,231 --> 00:19:21,510
to plus 60 or,
and now,

305
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,490
now you see that there's a very small
region there, which is the best, right?

306
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,190
The are probably the best place
to put something negative,

307
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,000
the worst place to put something
positive, right? And if we look at it,

308
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:37,650
we see that that you get as you move the
proton up and down their back and forth,

309
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,920
uh, you changed by half a
kilo calorie promotional.

310
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,320
If you go up and down
by half an Armstrong,

311
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,760
which would correspond
then if you went up there,

312
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,690
that's where we're
looking at on the surface.

313
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:53,550
So that's a plus or minus nine
degrees up and down. Okay,

314
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:58,030
so that, so that's a fairly tiny target,
although it doesn't cost, you know,

315
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,910
half of kilocalories and the enormous,

316
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:04,950
you could go further and not lose
too much. But look at the oxygen end.

317
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:09,090
If we rotate that one and look at
the water, and from the oxygen end,

318
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,590
we see there's a very big
streak of red that is 10,

319
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:18,720
that's a 10 kilocalories,
a total range from,

320
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,700
from, uh, from on the color
scale. And if we go, uh,

321
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:28,740
here to down to five,
which is the same scale be used over here,

322
00:20:28,741 --> 00:20:29,850
it's waste spread out.

323
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:35,060
And even if we go further to only one
and a half kilo kilocalories per mole,

324
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:40,350
you see that, that, that, uh, uh,

325
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,870
that for the entire color scale,

326
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:47,680
you can see that that red range
goes quite far up and down 0.3,

327
00:20:47,681 --> 00:20:50,410
eight angst terms plus
or minus 25 degrees,

328
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,080
and the energy changes only 0.05.

329
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,380
So it's very big red target
that you can tolerate.

330
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,610
So you have a tall target there and a
small target on the other one, right?

331
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,980
And now when you put them
together this way, you see,

332
00:21:02,981 --> 00:21:07,600
you can bend these down and get these
hydrogens far away from that one and still

333
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:12,601
have very good contact between [inaudible]
between the places that complimentary

334
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:17,500
charges are good to sit.
Um, that's a very, uh,

335
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,720
qualitative sort of analysis of this.

336
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:23,740
But it's a sort of funny minimum
energy structure for water.

337
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,100
But the important thing is that it's
consistent with just how the charges of

338
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,260
isolated waters would interact with one
another. Just charge charge interaction.

339
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:39,100
There's no special bonding.
Quantum mechanics didn't come into this.

340
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,080
Once you had the water molecules,

341
00:21:41,081 --> 00:21:44,440
you'd bring them together and that's
a reasonable way for them to fit.

342
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:50,170
And the dissociation energy is not large.
It's 3.3 kilocalories per mole,

343
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:54,970
but you can get other waters around
in about. So taking a a water out of,

344
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,970
out of, uh, uh,

345
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:01,390
out of taking a water molecule
into the gas phase out of water is,

346
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:04,570
is much more of course than
three kilocalories per mole.

347
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:08,500
So the important thing that
makes high from this perspective,

348
00:22:08,501 --> 00:22:12,610
what makes hydrogen bonding important
is that you have these dipoles,

349
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,400
but they can get very
close to one another.

350
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:19,270
Because remember the energy falls off
very rapidly with distance because

351
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:20,890
hydrogen is so small,

352
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,280
it can get very close to the
oxygen and have a dipole.

353
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,770
So it's just dipole dipole interaction.

354
00:22:26,771 --> 00:22:29,230
Like you have in any of these
other things we were looking at,

355
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,720
but they can get really,
really close to one another.

356
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:36,500
So you get more energy in the case
of hydrogen bonds, then you do, uh,

357
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,300
for other dipoles, right. So
nothing special. It's not,

358
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,160
there's no real bonding to it.

359
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:46,870
It's just that the molecules can come
together and be low in energy that way.

360
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:51,160
And typically that hydrogen
bonding is less than 5%.

361
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,880
Often much less than 5% is
strong as a covalent bond.

362
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,260
So a hydrogen bond isn't anything like
the bonds we talked about last semester

363
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:00,843
or is it

364
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:06,970
a hydrogen bonding can be subtle
and it's the subject of continuing

365
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:10,010
investigation. And there's a, uh, uh,

366
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:14,530
professor Johnson in the physical chemist
in our department is doing a lot of

367
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:17,500
work on instructor of water
and Professor Jorgenson,

368
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:21,130
a theoretician has done a lot
of work on water as well. Uh,

369
00:23:21,730 --> 00:23:26,710
so if you have ions involved,
so not neutral waters coming together,

370
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,130
but here the protonated water
coming together with a water.

371
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,940
Then the question is what kind of hydrogen
bonding are you going to get in this

372
00:23:33,941 --> 00:23:34,774
case?

373
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:40,920
And now the heat involved in those
things coming together instead of 3.3

374
00:23:40,931 --> 00:23:43,660
kilocalories per mole is 10 times greater,

375
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,130
32 kilocalories per mole.

376
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,000
But of course there's an entropy price
to pay when you pull these things

377
00:23:50,001 --> 00:23:50,834
together.

378
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:55,370
So the actual free energy change and
bringing them together isn't nearly as

379
00:23:55,371 --> 00:23:59,840
favorable because you're localizing things
that we're free to move around before.

380
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:05,060
So the free energy change at 300 Kelvin
is eight kilocalories per mole, uh,

381
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,050
in the gas phase. Right. But
here's what's interesting.

382
00:24:09,051 --> 00:24:12,230
There's the structure of this,
uh,

383
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:14,240
h five o two plus.

384
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:17,540
What do you notice about it as
compared to the water diver?

385
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:23,890
I gets bonded.

386
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:27,180
Why do you think so Lauren?
Why do you think it's bonded?

387
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,950
Because like the lines are going both
ways and like it looks like it's sitting

388
00:24:31,951 --> 00:24:34,530
right in the middle of right.
The hydrogen is right in the middle.

389
00:24:34,531 --> 00:24:37,860
It's not like the other one where the
hydrogen was a normal bond distance from

390
00:24:37,861 --> 00:24:41,070
one oxygen and quite far from the
other one. It's right in the middle.

391
00:24:41,071 --> 00:24:41,904
And in fact,

392
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,050
if you do a calculation of how much
energy it takes to move that hydrogen back

393
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,560
and forth,
you see that it's a single minimum,

394
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:51,390
not a double minimum,

395
00:24:51,391 --> 00:24:55,140
where it could be part of the time on one
part of the time on the other and jump

396
00:24:55,141 --> 00:24:59,310
back and forth. It's a single
minimum. The h plus is equally shared.

397
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,260
So this case is real bonding, right?
A single minimum in the middle.

398
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
Now how about if we do a,

399
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,720
the anti an example h three o two minus
hydroxide being hydrogen bonded by

400
00:25:12,781 --> 00:25:16,350
water. So what's the question
there? What's the answer there?

401
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,560
We know that that the energy involved is
rather similar to what it is for the h

402
00:25:21,871 --> 00:25:26,640
five o two it's 27 kilocalories
per mole in the gas phase.

403
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,630
But uh,
the structure is quite,

404
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:34,500
is rather different or is it right?
Is the,

405
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,560
is the hydrogen halfway in between?
Okay.

406
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:40,920
Well what do you notice about
this one compared to the cad I am,

407
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,310
it's a double minimum now.
Not a single minimum.

408
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:52,480
So it's lower in energy when the
hydrogen is on one end or the other.

409
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:57,760
At a maximum local maximum in
the middle. Right. However,

410
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,010
hydrogen is very light.

411
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:01,900
Yeah.

412
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,110
What does that have to do with it?

413
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,490
Go back to the beginning of last semester.

414
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,360
Pardon me tonally.
Right.

415
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,630
If you look at the very lowest energy
level for moving the hydrogen back and

416
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:21,200
forth, you'll see something interesting.
So this is a double minimum.

417
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:25,370
The hydrogen is not
symmetrically bound along this,

418
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:29,150
but it can't have the minimum
energy and the barrier is very low,

419
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,760
only 0.6 kilocalories per mole.

420
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:35,660
So if you look at the lowest
energy vibrational wave function,

421
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,280
it looks like that.
So even though it's a double minimum,

422
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:44,280
the hydrogen spends most
of its time in the middle

423
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:46,891
and the course,

424
00:26:46,891 --> 00:26:51,750
the reason that can do that is that the
reason that can spend most of its time

425
00:26:51,751 --> 00:26:55,260
in the middle is because there is
some bonding that lowers its energy.

426
00:26:55,261 --> 00:26:58,740
Where there, so there is, there
is, there can be hydrogen bonding.

427
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:02,070
We saw it in in h three o plus plus water.

428
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,320
We see it in hydroxide plus water,

429
00:27:04,321 --> 00:27:06,870
even though it's a double
minimum and potential energy,

430
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,040
it the thing can be in the middle. So
there is real bonding there. And in fact,

431
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:15,330
in pure water without ions,
if you have high pressure that forces,

432
00:27:15,331 --> 00:27:19,230
the water's closer together. So the
better part of a million atmospheres,

433
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:21,870
and this can be done in the laboratory,
uh,

434
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,810
the oxygen's get closer
together and closer together.

435
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,260
And what was a double minimum
becomes a single minimum.

436
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:33,650
And the structure of this form 10 of ice
water is nothing if not versatile right

437
00:27:37,051 --> 00:27:40,770
there more than 10 different structures
of ice that have been observed.

438
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:45,390
But this particular high pressure one,
as you can see from the structure,

439
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:50,070
has hydrogens halfway between.
So it's no longer a molecular water.

440
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,900
It's entire crystal.

441
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:55,920
The whole thing is one molecule with
hydrogen bonds holding it together.

442
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,420
But this is not what we usually are
talking about in terms of hydrogen bonds.

443
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:04,830
Normal hydrogen bonds are just this
polar interaction which are favorable

444
00:28:04,831 --> 00:28:07,830
because hydrogen so small and
can get close to other things.

445
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,230
Okay. Now we're going
to go on from, from uh,

446
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:17,300
this digression about water to talk
about crown ethers and what are called

447
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:23,100
tailored Ayana fours. So
here's, here's a crown.

448
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:25,770
Ether it, it, you can, uh,

449
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:30,090
you have to be imaginative
to see that as a crown, but,

450
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,060
but you can sort of imagine putting it
on your head and have all the little

451
00:28:33,061 --> 00:28:36,300
things go up around it.
I suppose that's where the name came from.

452
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:40,350
So this idea of having an oxygen and
then a bridge of two carbons and another

453
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:44,940
oxygen bridge, oxygen bridge in a ring.
Those are the crowns. So they have a name.

454
00:28:44,941 --> 00:28:46,980
This is 18 crown six.

455
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:51,810
So it's a crown alternating oxygen and
two carbons, oxygen and two carbons,

456
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:56,290
right? And it's six because they're
six oxygens in it. And this is the,

457
00:28:56,291 --> 00:29:00,720
this was one of the earliest ones,
uh, studied, uh, and in fact,

458
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,010
uh,
these,

459
00:29:02,011 --> 00:29:05,910
these crown ethers resulted in the Nobel
prize in chemistry for the people who

460
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,210
discovered and exploited them in,
in 1987.

461
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,380
Ayana for means and I,
and carrier,

462
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,110
the Greek root for us
means to carry things.

463
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,460
So these things are able to carry ions.
Let's see how that works.

464
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,350
So here's 18,
crown,

465
00:29:22,351 --> 00:29:27,030
six viewed from the top and from
the side with potassium chloride,

466
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,240
and you see the potassium is held inside.

467
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:34,970
I'll pass this around so you can
see it. Here's, here's the, uh,

468
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,590
the ring of, of six oxygens
connected by pairs of ch two groups.

469
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:45,330
And it turned out that a golf ball
is about the right scale to be the,

470
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:49,720
to have the radius of a potassium
ion on the scale of these models.

471
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:54,400
And you see it fits right in the
middle. The, the, if we look at the ox,

472
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,790
the six oxygens, they're not all
in a plain, as you can see there,

473
00:29:58,090 --> 00:30:01,990
there are three of them up
in three of them down. Right?

474
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:06,160
Does that remind you of anything,
Megan?

475
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,160
Just like Cyclohexane, he goes up,
down and down and down the chair.

476
00:30:10,161 --> 00:30:13,190
Cyclohexane right?
Uh,

477
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:18,490
and the potassium sits right in the
middle with three above and three below.

478
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:21,700
And I'll pass that around so you can,
so you can see it.

479
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,250
Yeah.

480
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,180
So potassium is just the right size to
fit in there. Fits right in the middle.

481
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,830
And if we look at the actual
distances that are involved,

482
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,130
you can see these distances
are all about a 2.8 on streams,

483
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,950
which is just about exactly the,

484
00:30:41,951 --> 00:30:46,951
some of the ionic Radii I of potassium
and the covalent radius of oxygen at 2.7

485
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:49,480
that would be,

486
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,140
those numbers aren't really such great
numbers so that it really fits right?

487
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,163
Okay.

488
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,940
Now what if you use a
bigger eye like caesium.

489
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,850
So cesium is 1.7 Ostrom.

490
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:05,830
So now 3.1 instead of 2.7 for
the oxygen cesium distance.

491
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:07,503
Right

492
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,970
now you can see that it's because caesium
is larger. It can't get in the middle.

493
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:13,940
It sits on top,
close to three of the oxygens,

494
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,230
and further from the bottom three oxygens.
There's the view from the back,

495
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,313
okay?

496
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:24,780
Now here, here's the skeleton with
the balls for the atoms of that,

497
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:28,290
and you can see that the closer
oxygens are at Vander walls,

498
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,360
distance 3.1 a extremes,

499
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:35,340
but the others are closer
to 3.2 or 3.3 ox drums.

500
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:36,983
Okay?

501
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,480
Now that distance is 4.8
on extremes, right? Well,

502
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,110
what happens if you would make it
even smaller? I'd in the middle.

503
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,513
Okay.

504
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,800
You can try to shrink clearing down,

505
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:54,483
right?

506
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,540
But if you pull those two closer together
in order to make all five of these

507
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:03,500
closer to whatever's in the middle,
then that one's going to get squeezed out.

508
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,520
All right?

509
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:10,830
So here's what happens. If you go to
sodium, right? And now that different,

510
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,910
that distance is 4.0 right. Uh, uh,

511
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:18,360
roughly at Ostrom's closer in order
to get these close to the, uh,

512
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:22,560
to the sodium sodium,
the oxygen is 2.4 right?

513
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:27,660
So that that sixth one got squeezed out,
but it came in from the bottom.

514
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,710
So if we look at the distances,

515
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:35,570
those are all in the
neighborhood of 2.4 2.51 is 2.6,

516
00:32:35,571 --> 00:32:37,040
so just a little bit bigger than,

517
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:40,880
than the Vanderwall is distance
and one on the bottom is 2.4.

518
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,880
So it squeezes underneath
and there's just, just happy.

519
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,710
But it leaves space on the top.

520
00:32:45,711 --> 00:32:49,070
And this particular crystal
structure has had a water in it.

521
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:54,420
So the water is up on top
at 2.32 Ostrom's. Yeah.

522
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,100
And if we get smaller still with lithium,

523
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:02,330
now the lithium can't shrink
the ring down anymore.

524
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:05,750
It gets close to just two of them.
A 2.2 oxygens.

525
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:09,170
Notice that's 2.1 and 2.1 2.07,

526
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:14,110
but it's further from the
others. Right? So, but,

527
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,710
and it notice it sits right in the
middle of the, of the, of the, uh,

528
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,600
the main plane of these things.

529
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:24,380
But what happens with interactions
with the far oxygen's,

530
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,840
this one has two waters,

531
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:32,260
so the water's bind to the lithium
and then the protons of the water,

532
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:37,120
our hydrogen bonded to those far oxygens.

533
00:33:37,121 --> 00:33:42,121
So lithium increases at
size by incorporating two
waters with it so it can fit

534
00:33:42,561 --> 00:33:44,600
in this thing.
Okay.

535
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:49,840
Now look at the equilibrium constant for
binding the cat ions to this 18 crown

536
00:33:50,391 --> 00:33:53,800
six that notice that potassium,
uh,

537
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:57,020
is by far the biggest.
So these are too big.

538
00:33:57,021 --> 00:34:00,770
We looked at cesium sodium and lithium,
or too small,

539
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:06,500
but potassium is just right.
Okay, so when this is one,

540
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:10,430
this is 60 times bigger,
okay?

541
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:15,350
Now the equilibrium constant is of
course the concentration of the complex

542
00:34:15,351 --> 00:34:19,490
divided by the concentrations of the
metal ion and the ligand product,

543
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:24,170
right? So it has units expressed
this way, it's per molar,

544
00:34:24,890 --> 00:34:28,730
right? And if you look at the actual
value, not just relative to one another,

545
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:31,130
which was what's plotted first,
but the actual value,

546
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,150
you see that it's over a million,
this equilibrium constant.

547
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:39,620
Now let's think of what that means.
That one's 23,000 okay?

548
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,500
So what this means is that when,

549
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:48,260
when the league and down
here equals, uh, let's see,

550
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,423
when,

551
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:53,600
when the League and Times K is one,

552
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:58,280
then you have 50% this is one to one,
right?

553
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,430
If you multiply this over here
and that comes out to one,

554
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:05,480
then you have the same amount of metal
that's uncomplex as you have of metal.

555
00:35:05,481 --> 00:35:07,610
That's complex,
okay?

556
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:13,690
So what that means is that it's half
complex when you have one micro molar of

557
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:19,610
the concentration of the league and,
right? So it holds on very, very tightly,

558
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,733
right?

559
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:26,720
Now bear in mind that there's something
else that could complex with the

560
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:31,370
potassium ion the uh,
the methanol Sullivan could do.

561
00:35:31,371 --> 00:35:34,940
So this is done in methanol
solvent at room temperature.

562
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:38,730
Now methanol is 0.7 grams per milliliter.

563
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,590
It's molecular weight is 32, so we can
calculate what its concentration is.

564
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,460
Its concentration is 25 molar,
right?

565
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:53,180
So the league and is able at at one micro
molar is able to beat out methanol at

566
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:57,660
25 molar,

567
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,653
right?

568
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:06,450
So it's 29 million times stronger than
methanol at binding to this by having all

569
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:12,040
these six arrange. So they grab it
just right, it fits just right. Okay.

570
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:16,690
The energy involved as 13 kilocalories
per mole of stabilization. Again,

571
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:21,460
nothing compared to covalent
bonds that we talked about, uh,

572
00:36:21,461 --> 00:36:25,360
and, but it's much more favorable
in the case of, of a potassium.

573
00:36:25,361 --> 00:36:29,050
That is the case of sodium,
which is five kilocalories less.

574
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:34,180
Okay. But by notice what
this does, when you put this,

575
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:38,920
this crown around the, the golf
ball, it makes it much bigger,

576
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:44,470
right? But what holds the salt
assault together is the, the,

577
00:36:44,471 --> 00:36:47,380
the attraction between the cad ion.
And the I in,

578
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,120
which depends very much on distance.
So if you make the ions bigger,

579
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,650
as we mentioned in the last lecture,

580
00:36:53,651 --> 00:36:58,651
they won't interact so strongly so it's
not so stable to be in this in the salt,

581
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,630
in the solid salt farm,
it's easier to dissolve.

582
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:06,990
So you could dissolve
potassium permanganate in
hydrocarbons if you use crown

583
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:11,080
ether to put in there to make the
potassium ever so much bigger.

584
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,150
So this has worked out in lab
in a way that's shown here.

585
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:20,350
So you have some organic solvent and you
have put something in it that you want

586
00:37:20,351 --> 00:37:25,180
to oxidize. So you need an oxidizing
agent. Ah, potassium permanganate,

587
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,600
right? So we have, uh,

588
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:32,470
we have an organic substance
to be oxidized and we put
in potassium permanganate

589
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:34,930
and it just sits on the
bottom of the flask.

590
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,920
It doesn't get the where the
where the organic molecules are.

591
00:37:38,921 --> 00:37:43,630
So there's no reaction.
All right, so what that,

592
00:37:43,631 --> 00:37:45,610
but if you,
and if you put water in,

593
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:48,530
that will dissolve the
potassium permanganate,

594
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:52,690
but it won't get the potassium per bag
and age where the organic stuff to be

595
00:37:52,691 --> 00:37:53,770
oxidized is.

596
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:58,510
It'll just be two phases of purple phase
that has the water phase that has the

597
00:37:58,511 --> 00:38:02,290
purveying and aid in it. And then the
organic phase just floating above it.

598
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,273
Yeah.

599
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:07,530
Okay.
But if you put in the crown ether,

600
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:11,040
then the Parang Guneet
can dissolve in the,

601
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:16,060
in the organic solvent and can do the
trick. Right? So by Mike is a cat.

602
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:21,061
I in large 18 crown six destabilizes
a solid or aqueous Promega and eight

603
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:23,550
allowing the salt to
dissolve and hydrocarbons.

604
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,990
And people call this purple benzene.
I actually have never done this.

605
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:31,560
I've never seen Purple Benzene,
but Professors Ziegler has done it.

606
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:35,380
And he tells me that the Purple Benzene
prepare this way isn't purple at it's

607
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,450
yellow. So, so,

608
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:40,840
so that's just his one experiment.

609
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:44,380
So I don't know that it's never purple,
but that's what he told me.

610
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,730
So maybe it maybe purple benzene look
sort of yellow according to Professor

611
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:50,040
Ziegler.

612
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:53,920
That would just be because Promega Nate
in an organic solvent has a different

613
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:58,030
spectrum for prepaying an aid and water
solvent, which wouldn't be surprising. Uh,

614
00:38:58,031 --> 00:39:00,520
but this process is,
but it works.

615
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:05,290
People are able to do oxidations this
way and it's called phase transfer.

616
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:09,250
Katala says, cause the idea is to get a
reagent from one phase into the other.

617
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,350
You use the,
the uh,

618
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,250
the crown ether as a catalyst
that doesn't get consumed, right?

619
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:19,000
It just helps the stuff get there and
do its reaction in the other phase.

620
00:39:19,001 --> 00:39:22,480
So it's Catallo assists and you don't
have to use crown ethers for this,

621
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:23,950
although they are used for it.

622
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,280
You can get a similar effect by having
other really big cat ions that make it

623
00:39:29,381 --> 00:39:33,160
possible for an anti and to go into the,
to the organic phase.

624
00:39:33,161 --> 00:39:38,161
So Tetra Al ammonium or Tetra
Al Kill Phospho Niamh salts.

625
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:43,330
And the advantage of these things is that
there are solvents that will dissolve

626
00:39:43,331 --> 00:39:48,331
both organic things and potassium
permanganate or other salt reagents,

627
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:53,830
but those salts like dimethyl sulfoxide
that we'll do that are dangerous and

628
00:39:53,831 --> 00:39:54,790
they're expensive.

629
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:59,290
So this is an example of green
chemistry to do chemistry in a more

630
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:03,490
environmentally favorable
way by using these ethers or,

631
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,650
or simple assaults as a way of,
of getting the reagents to mix.

632
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:14,380
Okay. Now a further development
on this is called crip. Dan's,

633
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,180
which you notice is like a crown ether,
except that it has a nitrogen in it,

634
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,150
which is try Vaillant rather
than oxygen being divalent.

635
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:26,770
So you can get another bridge across so
you can get these crypts into which to

636
00:40:26,771 --> 00:40:27,640
hide things.

637
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:32,850
So here's an example of a crypto hand
and a genre lane who did this work with?

638
00:40:33,731 --> 00:40:38,410
John Pierre Salvage, uh, got,
got the Nobel prize for this,

639
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:40,660
shared the Nobel prize
for these crown ethers.

640
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:45,580
So now you can put different numbers of
these. Oh ch two ch two groups in here.

641
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:49,610
So you could make different
sizes for these rings. Uh,

642
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,680
so here's an example of,
of where l is one.

643
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,830
So you have one bridge that has two
oxygens and to bridge that have one,

644
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:00,220
two bridges that have one oxygen.
And I've made a model of that here.

645
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:03,520
So you see there two bridges,
two oxygens here on the top,

646
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,070
but there's one on this way and one here.

647
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,310
And two nitrogens also point
in with their loan pairs.

648
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:12,610
So that makes it pretty hard.
It's pretty small cavity inside.

649
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,070
I'll pass that one around to you

650
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,270
and you won't be surprised to hear them.

651
00:41:19,271 --> 00:41:24,271
That when you look at the equilibrium
constant in methanol for putting various

652
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:29,560
salts in there, that lithium is
the one that binds most strongly,

653
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:34,610
the smallest of the ions. It has an
ionic radius of a little less than,

654
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,750
uh, than, uh, than three
quarters of an angst from.

655
00:41:39,770 --> 00:41:44,660
So it fits. Uh, but sodium doesn't
fit as well. Potassium's bad.

656
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:49,430
And these are whited out because in fact,
they come down off, they were measured,

657
00:41:49,431 --> 00:41:53,090
but they come way down off the
bottom of this graph. Okay?

658
00:41:53,091 --> 00:41:57,470
Now if you put a make one or the
other bridges have two oxygens in it.

659
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:59,900
So you increase the size
of the hole a little bit.

660
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:03,200
Now it binds sodium the best.

661
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,810
And if you put the other bridge
bigger at pines potassium the best,

662
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:14,300
and if you put two carbons and one of
the bridges, it binds rubidium the vest.

663
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:19,970
And if you put two carbons in all the
bridges that bind cesium last best,

664
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,240
and I put caesium one 37 here because
that's a byproduct of a isotope in

665
00:42:26,831 --> 00:42:28,910
Richmond.
And nuclear industry,

666
00:42:28,911 --> 00:42:31,820
and it's a common pollutant
that they want to get rid of.

667
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:36,320
So what they're trying to
do now is to design a crip,

668
00:42:36,321 --> 00:42:39,710
Dan's that will readily bind to cesium.

669
00:42:39,711 --> 00:42:42,260
So you can take the earth
or whatever has been,

670
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:46,700
or are these a million gallon barrels
that have this waste stuff in him.

671
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,450
Put something in a little specifically
get the cesium, which is the bat,

672
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:53,550
the worst actor among these,
uh,

673
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,500
among these a radioactive
byproducts that'll take them,

674
00:42:57,530 --> 00:42:59,150
put it in another phase,

675
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:04,310
and then make it reversible so that you
can take the crypt and off and use it

676
00:43:04,311 --> 00:43:08,390
again. Right? So there's a lot of work
being done on that kind of thing now,

677
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:13,370
but they're also, it's also can
be used in biology. For example,

678
00:43:13,371 --> 00:43:16,850
there's a bacterial
antibiotic called known actin,

679
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,270
which you see is a ring that
has a lot of oxygens in it.

680
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:22,460
Now that ring is quite a big one,

681
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:27,140
but you can curl it around
like this as I show here,

682
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,430
right? Ben? Those ends up right.

683
00:43:31,790 --> 00:43:34,910
And then the chain looks like
the seams on a tennis ball.

684
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:39,260
But you have all these oxygen's that
can then be directed toward the middle.

685
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:44,760
So here's a picture of that, uh,
of that wrapped around a cat eye.

686
00:43:44,761 --> 00:43:49,010
And now it's not easy to, to uh, see, uh,

687
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:53,090
the three dimensions here, but if you
will let it rotate, you can see how,

688
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,013
what the,
uh,

689
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,060
what the shape is of this thing that's
wrapped completely around the potassium

690
00:43:59,061 --> 00:44:01,420
ion with, with, uh,

691
00:44:01,470 --> 00:44:05,840
eight oxygen's coordinated
as the potassium, right?

692
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,810
And they're there,
you can see the seams on a tennis ball,

693
00:44:08,811 --> 00:44:12,050
which traced this chain,
right?

694
00:44:12,350 --> 00:44:16,880
And the equilibrium constant in
methanol for holding onto sodium is 512.

695
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:20,750
But for potassium, the one that's
shown there, it's, it's 31,000.

696
00:44:20,751 --> 00:44:24,340
So it's very selective, right?
And it's even tighter with,

697
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:25,850
with ammonia in the middle.

698
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:31,140
And so how do these things
work in biology? I mean,

699
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:34,920
I should know. I don't, I don't
know, but, but, uh, but the,

700
00:44:34,921 --> 00:44:39,921
the general idea is that they could
make ions dissolve in organic things,

701
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,750
right? So, you know,

702
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,440
the potential in your cells has to do
with pumping sodium and potassium ions

703
00:44:46,441 --> 00:44:48,360
back and forth.
And creating a gradient.

704
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:51,530
And if you suddenly put something
in there, it'll say potassium, oh,

705
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:54,450
can go wherever you want.
Right? That destroys this.

706
00:44:54,451 --> 00:44:58,390
And it's bad for living things.
So anyhow, that th th the,

707
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,880
the biology has a number of things that
can do this kind of trick with ions as

708
00:45:02,881 --> 00:45:05,730
well.
Uh,

709
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:10,410
now the next topic is the importance
of solvent for ionic reactions.

710
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:13,770
And I'm gonna start this since
we started a little bit late,

711
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,410
but we'll complete it next time.

712
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:20,370
So we're interested in the reaction water,

713
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:23,850
a water molecule in Wa
surrounded by water and water,

714
00:45:23,851 --> 00:45:28,110
solvent dissociated to
give h plus and o h minus,

715
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:29,190
right?

716
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:31,740
And we want to know what energy is going
to be involved in that and what will

717
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:33,330
the equilibrium constant B,

718
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:38,070
and I think you people know
the equilibrium constant
from your AP chemistry,

719
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:41,700
but we're going to look at it a different
way as to how, what, what's involved,

720
00:45:41,910 --> 00:45:44,250
what role the solvent plays in this.

721
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:47,730
So the way we're going to do it
is to look at it without solve it,

722
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,410
by going into the gas phase.

723
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,160
So if we pump in 6.3
kilocalories per mole,

724
00:45:53,370 --> 00:45:56,850
we can make the water,
the water that's in water,

725
00:45:56,851 --> 00:45:59,310
become water in the gas phase.
Okay.

726
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,000
And now we know we can look
up in a Ellison's table,

727
00:46:03,001 --> 00:46:07,500
the bond association energy for Water
and find that it's going to take a 120

728
00:46:07,501 --> 00:46:11,880
kilocalories per mole to get
it apart to h Adam and Ooh,

729
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13,730
radical,
right?

730
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:19,530
And then if we transfer an electron from
one to the other, that's then going to,

731
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:23,610
going to get us the species
we're interested in.

732
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:25,050
But in the gas phase,

733
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:30,380
that's a 392 kilocalories per mole
in toto to do those two things,

734
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:35,550
those three things. Okay. And
remember the Coolum energy is,

735
00:46:35,551 --> 00:46:40,380
this is the,
the gorilla in this particular scheme,

736
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:43,140
it's that 332 uh,

737
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,440
kilocalories divided by Armstrong.
So that's the big one.

738
00:46:46,441 --> 00:46:50,580
That's that electron transfer
and getting the ions apart.

739
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:53,750
So the equilibrium constant
and the gas phase is,

740
00:46:53,751 --> 00:46:58,740
is a 10 to the minus 290 not
a very favorable process.

741
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:03,930
Okay.
But we know that it can happen in water.

742
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:08,340
So the Solvan has a lot to do with it,
and we'll talk about that next time.
