00:00:01.367 --> 00:00:04.303
if you spent any time on Twitter
in the past 48 hours,

00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:06.105
then you've heard about
our next story.

00:00:06.138 --> 00:00:08.574
Rapper B.o.B. blowing up Twitter

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:11.477
with his theories on
the actual shape of the earth.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.647
Rapper B.o.B.-- perhaps you know
him for hits "Airplanes"

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.618
and "Nothin' On You"-- he firmly
believes that the earth is flat.

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:21.054
He is on a Twitter mission
to prove it,

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:23.322
and he says he has
photographic evidence

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.092
and that we've been
fooled all this time.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.262
Mm. Mm.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.731
You know, guys, first time
I heard "Nothin' On You",

00:00:31.764 --> 00:00:33.499
I definitely thought,
"This B.o.B. guy--

00:00:33.532 --> 00:00:37.270
he is the one to finally take
down that asshole Aristotle."

00:00:37.303 --> 00:00:40.139
Take him down.
Take him down.

00:00:40.172 --> 00:00:42.175
Seriously, though,
these tweets are amazing.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.011
"...the horizon
is always eye level..."

00:00:45.044 --> 00:00:48.414
"Once you go flat
you never go back"?

00:00:48.447 --> 00:00:51.250
"...where is the curve?"

00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:53.653
Um, B.o.B., if you're
looking for the curve,

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:56.956
you got to call Sir Mix-A-Lot.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.593
That is a man
who did not deny science.

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.929
He did not.
Am I right?

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:04.564
I'm not lying about that. Okay.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.366
Anyway, so this thing
went viral.

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.769
And even world-renowned
super scientist

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.637
and friend of<i> The Nightly Show</i>
 Neil deGrasse Tyson

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.274
got involved and refuted some
of B.o.B.'s retrograde nonsense,

00:01:15.307 --> 00:01:18.044
which prompted B.o.B.
to release a diss track

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.912
called "Flatline".
Here's a taste.

00:01:19.945 --> 00:01:22.148 line:0%

This (bleep)
just got real, y'all.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:37.597
Uh-oh.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.499
I'm gonna tell you--
looks like we've got ourselves

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.635
a r...
code red science emergency.

00:01:42.668 --> 00:01:44.804
So I'm gonna have to
do something I rarely do.

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:46.506
I got to hit
the science panic button.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.575
WOMAN: Science emergency
defense program initiated.

00:01:49.608 --> 00:01:51.077
Science emergency defense
program initiated.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.881
-Oh, my God. -Science emergency
defense program initiated.

00:01:54.914 --> 00:01:57.650
(audience cheering, applauding)

00:01:57.683 --> 00:02:01.053
WILMORE: Hey, Neil...
Neil deGrasse Tyson!

00:02:01.086 --> 00:02:04.924
-Larry?
-It's Neil deGrasse Tyson.

00:02:04.957 --> 00:02:07.460
Neil deGrasse Tyson, everybody.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.362
Yes.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:11.264
Look at... look at that.
Thank you.

00:02:11.297 --> 00:02:12.798
-Larry...
-Yes?

00:02:12.831 --> 00:02:15.067
I'm trying to eat my dinner,
I got your distress call.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.170
-I apologize, I know.
-Is everything okay?

00:02:17.203 --> 00:02:19.906
No, Neil, everything
is not okay.

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.875
This B.o.B. BS about
the earth being flat

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:25.011
is getting out of control.
Can you please help us?

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.312
Uh, h-hold my sandwich.

00:02:26.345 --> 00:02:28.114
-Oh, sure, okay.
-I'm sorry.

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.149
Here, you take that.
Here, here, you want your...

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:33.686
-Oh. Oh. Oh, my God. Okay.
-(audience cheering, applauding)

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:36.289
Looks good.
All right. Go.

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.492 line:0%
All right, listen B.o.B.,
once and for all.

00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:41.627 line:0%
The earth looks flat
because, one,

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.863 line:0%
you're not far enough away
at your size.

00:02:43.896 --> 00:02:46.966
Two, your... your size
isn't large enough

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.369
relative to earth
to notice any curvature at all.

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:52.738
It's a fundamental fact
of calculus

00:02:52.771 --> 00:02:54.674
and non-Euclidean geometry.

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:56.676
Small sections
of large curved surfaces

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.413
will always look flat to little
creatures that crawl upon it.

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.949
But this...

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:06.586
but this whole thing-- it's just
a symptom of a larger problem.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.721
There's a growing
anti-intellectual strain

00:03:08.754 --> 00:03:10.957
in this country that many th...
that may be

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.794
the beginning of the end
of our informed democracy.

00:03:14.827 --> 00:03:16.929
O-Of course, in a free society,

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:19.999
you can and should
think whatever you want.

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:23.436
And if you want to think the
world is flat, go right ahead.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:26.472
But if you think the world
is flat and you have influence

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:30.042
over others,
as would successful rappers

00:03:30.075 --> 00:03:32.278
or even presidential candidates,

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:34.614
then being wrong

00:03:34.647 --> 00:03:36.682
becomes being harmful--

00:03:36.715 --> 00:03:37.917
to the health, the wealth,

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.986
and the security
of our citizenry.

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.089
Discovery and exploration
got us out of the caves.

00:03:43.122 --> 00:03:44.757
And each generation benefits

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.859
from what previous generations
have learned.

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:50.496
Isaac Newton, my man,
said, "I have...

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:53.032
"If I have seen
farther than others,

00:03:53.065 --> 00:03:55.801
it's by standing
on the shoulders of giants."

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:57.837
(cheering, whooping)

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.007
-WILMORE: Yeah! (whoops)
-Can I get an amen?

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.743
So that's right, B.o.B.,
when you stand on the shoulders

00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:05.711
of those who came before,

00:04:05.744 --> 00:04:08.047
you might just
see far enough to realize

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.917
the earth isn't (bleep) flat.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.453
And by the way...

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.019
this is called gravity.
