00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
So let's generalize a bit
what we learned in the

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:03.830
last presentation.

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.280
Let's say I'm
borrowing P dollars.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.790
P dollars, that's what I
borrowed so that's my

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.740
initial principal.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.420
So that's principal.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.070
r is equal to the rate,
the interest rate that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.310
I'm borrowing at.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.600
We can also write that
as 100r%, right?

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.370
And I'm going to borrow
it for-- well, I

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.510
don't know-- t years.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.210
Let's see if we can come up
with equations to figure out

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.960
how much I'm going to owe at
the end of t years using either

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.170
simple or compound interest.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.450
So let's do simple first
because that's simple.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:48.460
So at time 0-- so let's make
this the time axis-- how

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.310
much am I going to owe?

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.950
Well, that's right when I
borrow it, so if I paid

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.220
it back immediately, I
would just owe P, right?

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.730
At time 1, I owe P plus the
interest, plus you can kind of

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.460
view it as the rent on that
money, and that's r times P.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.390
And that previously, in the
previous example, in the

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.900
previous video, was 10%.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.043
P was 100, so I had to pay $10
to borrow that money for a

00:01:11.043 --> 00:01:13.265
year, and I had to
pay back $110.

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:18.610
And this is the same thing
as P times 1 plus r, right?

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.830
Because you could
just use 1P plus rP.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.080
And then after two years,
how much do we owe?

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.190
Well, every year, we just
pay another rP, right?

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.860
In the previous example,
it was another $10.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.000
So if this is 10%, every
year we just pay 10% of

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.360
our original principal.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.730
So in year 2, we owe P plus
rP-- that's what we owed in

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.500
year 1-- and then another
rP, so that equals

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.350
P plus 1 plus 2r.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.720
And just take the P out,
and you get a 1 plus r

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.840
plus r, so 1 plus 2r.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.770
And then in year 3, we'd owe
what we owed in year 2.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.330
So P plus rP plus rP, and then
we just pay another rP, another

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.830
say, you know, if r is 10%, or
50% of our original principal,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:10.300
plus rP, and so that
equals P times 1 plus 3r.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.910
So after t years,
how much do we owe?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.815
Well, it's our original
principal times 1 plus,

00:02:18.815 --> 00:02:22.330
and it'll be tr.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.920
So you can distribute this out
because every year we pay Pr,

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.390
and there's going
to be t years.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.970
And so that's why
it makes sense.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.940
So if I were to say
I'm borrowing-- let's

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.410
do some numbers.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.460
You could work it out this way,
and I recommend you do it.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.100
You shouldn't just
memorize formulas.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:45.820
If I were to borrow $50 at 15%
simple interest for 15-- or

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.700
let's say for 20 years, at the
end of the 20 years, I would

00:02:50.700 --> 00:03:04.000
owe $50 times 1 plus the
time 20 times 0.15, right?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.960
And that's equal to $50 times 1
plus-- what's 20 times 0.15?

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.220
That's 3, right?

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.060
Right.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.550
So it's 50 times 4, which
is equal to $200 to

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:18.740
borrow it for 20 years.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.920
So $50 at 15% for 20
years results in a $200

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.700
payment at the end.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.010
So this was simple
interest, and this was

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.370
the formula for it.

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.560
Let's see if we can do the same
thing with compound interest.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.770
Let me erase all this.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.800
That's not how I
wanted to erase it.

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.340
There we go.

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.430
OK, so with compound interest,
in year 1, it's the same thing,

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.020
really, as simple interest, and
we saw that in the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.820
previous video.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:04.810
I owe P plus, and now the rate
times P, and that equals

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.190
P times 1 plus r.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.450
Fair enough.

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.810
Now year 2 is where compound
and simple interest diverge.

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.820
In simple interest, we would
just pay another rP, and

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.170
it becomes 1 plus 2r.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:19.190
In compound interest,
this becomes the new

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.010
principal, right?

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.050
So if this is the new
principal, we are going to pay

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.370
1 plus r times this, right?

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.820
Our original principal was P.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:35.000
After one year, we paid 1 plus
r times the original principal

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.270
times 1 plus r rate.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.520
So to go into year 2, we're
going to pay what we owed at

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.640
the end of year 1, which is P
times 1 plus r, and then we're

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.640
going to grow that
by r percent.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.240
So we're going to multiply
that again times 1 plus r.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.900
And so that equals P
times 1 plus r squared.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.950
So the way you could think
about it, in simple interest,

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:09.170
every year we added a Pr.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.330
In simple interest, we
added plus Pr every year.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.760
So if this was $50 and this is
15%, every year we're adding

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.840
$3-- we're adding--
what was that?

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.460
50%.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.520
We're adding $7.50 in interest,
where P is the principal,

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.560
r is the rate.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.480
In compound interest, every
year we're multiplying the

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.680
principal times 1 plus
the rate, right?

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.930
So if we go to year 3,
we're going to multiply

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.230
this times 1 plus r.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.090
So year 3 is P times 1
plus r to the third.

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:42.160
So year t is going to be
principal times 1 plus

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.240
r to the t-th power.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.980
And so let's see
that same example.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.870
We owe $200 in this example
with simple interest.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:53.190
Let's see what we owe
in compound interest.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.980
The principal is $50.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.640
1 plus-- and what's the rate?

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.690
0.15.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.180
And we're borrowing
it for 20 years.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:14.910
So this is equal to 50 times
1.15 to the 20th power.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.070
I know you can't read that,
but let me see what I can

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.680
do about the 20th power.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.905
Let me use my Excel and
clear all of this.

00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:31.840
Actually, I should just use my
mouse instead of the pen tool

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.950
to the clear everything.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.770
OK, so let me just
pick a random point.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:42.220
So I just want to-- plus 1.15
to the 20th power, and you

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.940
could use any calculator:
16.37, let's say.

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:55.460
So this equals 50 times 16.37.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:58.170
And what's 50 times that?

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:08.560
Plus 50 times that: $818.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:11.780
So you've now realized that if
someone's giving you a loan and

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.320
they say, oh, yeah, I'll lend
you-- you need a 20-year loan?

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.340
I'm going to lend
it to you at 15%.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:19.840
It's pretty important to
clarify whether they're going

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.400
to charge you 15% interest at
simple interest or

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.870
compound interest.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.770
Because with compound interest,
you're going to end up paying--

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:31.900
I mean, look at this: just to
borrow $50, you're going to

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:36.180
be paying $618 more than if
this was simple interest.

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:40.480
Unfortunately, in the real
world, most of it is

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.690
compound interest.

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:44.250
And not only is it compounding,
but they don't even just

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:46.170
compound it every year and they
don't even just compound it

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.810
every six months, they actually
compound it continuously.

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:50.830
And so you should watch the
next several videos on

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:53.750
continuously compounding
interest, and then you'll

00:07:53.750 --> 00:07:57.190
actually start to learn
about the magic of e.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.910
Anyway, I'll see you
all in the next video.
