00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.280
one of the questions that we're all

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
one of the questions that we're all
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.070
one of the questions that we're all
asking now is what effect are the new

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080
asking now is what effect are the new
 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.799
asking now is what effect are the new
technologies of the internet Computers

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809
technologies of the internet Computers
 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.960

cell phone screens going to have on the

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:14.970
cell phone screens going to have on the
 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:17.120
cell phone screens going to have on the
next generation of children and the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130
next generation of children and the
 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.920
next generation of children and the
answer is we won't know for another 20

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930
answer is we won't know for another 20
 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.680
answer is we won't know for another 20
years until those children grow up but I

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690
years until those children grow up but I
 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.350
years until those children grow up but I
think we can make some guesses based on

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:24.360
think we can make some guesses based on
 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.560
think we can make some guesses based on
our past human history and one of the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570
our past human history and one of the
 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.180
our past human history and one of the
things about human beings is that we've

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190
things about human beings is that we've
 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.310
things about human beings is that we've
been technological beings from the very

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320
been technological beings from the very
 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.110
been technological beings from the very
beginning in fact in a way that's the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
beginning in fact in a way that's the
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.700
beginning in fact in a way that's the
thing that's most distinctive about us

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710
thing that's most distinctive about us
 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.549
thing that's most distinctive about us
we use tools we modify and change our

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559
we use tools we modify and change our
 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.900
we use tools we modify and change our
environments we we create new ways of

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910
environments we we create new ways of
 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.639
environments we we create new ways of
being in the world both physically and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649
being in the world both physically and
 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:44.959
being in the world both physically and
socially and that's what we've always

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
socially and that's what we've always
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.510
socially and that's what we've always
done and we've always changed we've

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
done and we've always changed we've
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.060
done and we've always changed we've
always had culture which enabled us to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070
always had culture which enabled us to
 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010
always had culture which enabled us to
take the inventions of one generation

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020
take the inventions of one generation
 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.470
take the inventions of one generation
and then modify or change them to suit

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480
and then modify or change them to suit
 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.869
and then modify or change them to suit
another generation so the fact that we

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879
another generation so the fact that we
 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.310
another generation so the fact that we
have technology and the fact that that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
have technology and the fact that that
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.650
have technology and the fact that that
technology changes and it changes across

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660
technology changes and it changes across
 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.350
technology changes and it changes across
generations none of that's new but

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360
generations none of that's new but
 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.050
generations none of that's new but
curiously part of the effect of that

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060
curiously part of the effect of that
 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.300
curiously part of the effect of that
cultural change is it always seems as if

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
cultural change is it always seems as if
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.730
cultural change is it always seems as if
the technology that we grew up with is

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740
the technology that we grew up with is
 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.120
the technology that we grew up with is
eternal it's just part of nature it has

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130
eternal it's just part of nature it has
 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.070
eternal it's just part of nature it has
always been there and the technology

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
always been there and the technology
 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.020
always been there and the technology
that our children come up with is part

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030
that our children come up with is part
 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.190
that our children come up with is part

of a dystopian Mad Max future apocalypse
 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.559
of a dystopian Mad Max future apocalypse
and that's also been true for as long as

00:01:24.559 --> 00:01:24.569
and that's also been true for as long as
 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:26.889
and that's also been true for as long as
we've been around as human beings so

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899
we've been around as human beings so
 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.210
we've been around as human beings so
many of the technologies that you could

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220
many of the technologies that you could
 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.219
many of the technologies that you could
argue really did have transformative

effects on us are things like the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420
effects on us are things like the
 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.320
effects on us are things like the
printing press the Telegraph the Train

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:36.330
printing press the Telegraph the Train
 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.749
printing press the Telegraph the Train
we don't think about a telegraph as

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
we don't think about a telegraph as
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.260
we don't think about a telegraph as
being any amazingly disruptive new

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
being any amazingly disruptive new
 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.540
being any amazingly disruptive new
technology but when Telegraph's and

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550
technology but when Telegraph's and
 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.820
technology but when Telegraph's and
trains were introduced there were just

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830
trains were introduced there were just
 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.710
trains were introduced there were just
as many editorials in the paper saying

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720
as many editorials in the paper saying
 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.900
as many editorials in the paper saying
this these are awful ideas they're going

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910
this these are awful ideas they're going
 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.630
this these are awful ideas they're going
to reshape our lives in ways that are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640
to reshape our lives in ways that are
 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.760
to reshape our lives in ways that are
going to be completely destructive of of

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770
going to be completely destructive of of
 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.949
going to be completely destructive of of
human happiness now in some ways that's

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959
human happiness now in some ways that's
 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:00.050
human happiness now in some ways that's
right I mean the printing press really

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060
right I mean the printing press really
 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.330
right I mean the printing press really
did completely change the way that we

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340
did completely change the way that we
 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.190
did completely change the way that we
related to the world and related to each

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
related to the world and related to each
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.969
related to the world and related to each
other

The Telegraph meant that we went from

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:07.739
The Telegraph meant that we went from
 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:09.529
The Telegraph meant that we went from

light that made an enormous change in

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610
light that made an enormous change in
 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.309
light that made an enormous change in
the way that we functioned and related

I think it's quite plausible that things

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860
I think it's quite plausible that things
 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.589
I think it's quite plausible that things
like the Internet are also going to make

like the Internet are also going to make
 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.510
like the Internet are also going to make
it a change in the way that we think the

it a change in the way that we think the
 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.460
it a change in the way that we think the
way we relate to one another but the

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
way we relate to one another but the
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.290
way we relate to one another but the
assumption that somehow this time it's

different this is going to be the change
that's going to destroy our brains or

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420
that's going to destroy our brains or
 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.320
that's going to destroy our brains or
destroy our minds it doesn't really fit

this kind of ratchet this sense that the

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
this kind of ratchet this sense that the
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.000
this kind of ratchet this sense that the
technological change in our generation

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
technological change in our generation
 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.400
technological change in our generation
is totally different than any of the

is totally different than any of the
 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.440
is totally different than any of the
others is that there's a big difference

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450
others is that there's a big difference
 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.479
