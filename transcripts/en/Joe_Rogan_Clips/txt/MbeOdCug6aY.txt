Speaker 1:          00:00          Molly, you're definitely one of the best in the world, man. I get happy when you're refereeing a fight because I don't know that it's going to be handled. The, I mean, I agree with you on virtually every single time you and I have had a discussion about what should or shouldn't be done. Much of a struggle. It is. Right. Especially clench work. Exactly. The guys get a guy up against the cage. There's, they're working for something. They might stall each other out, but eventually someone might break down. Right. I mean, and this is how a garlic [inaudible] men off wins fights against elite guys. This is how Randy coture one, a lot of fights. It's a legitimate tactic. Yeah. Cause it doesn't look fun for you. You know, like a guy beating a guy up against the cage is short elbows, knees to the thighs. You might think that that's not enough.

Speaker 1:          00:46          But that's, that's uh, that's a good way to where a dude out and you keep doing that until eventually you break them. And especially when you're someone like Steve Bay or, yeah. Yeah. I think, I think for me it's helpful as I do my pre-fight instructions, you know, so I tell the fighters what I expect and what to expect from me, you know what I mean? So I don't want to, I want to interfere as little as possible. Yeah, I know. You know? And so that's, that's my goal. And so I, you know, I give them instruction. If I tell him, you know, hey, work work would I expect and you know, I expect you to do something too. I'm, when I'm looking for big shots or advance your position. And then they'll ask me like, well, how much, how long will you leave something stale?

Speaker 1:          01:22          I go, well, what is still, if they're both guys were relaxed, that still, but like you're talking about even up against the fence in a clinch, especially that's where a lot of things are really getting decided. And so we have to really see that play out. You know, especially a lot of the guys are, you know, they're, they're striking in each other and maybe in some of the other weight classes, you know, uh, then they don't have that one punch all ways. Uh, some of the guys do, but not everyone does. And that's where things are going to get cited in that clinch. And if there's a tension, if there's a tension there, we need to see where that's gonna go and let it work itself out. I'm so glad you said that. That's a perfect way to say it. That's absolutely. I hundred percent agree.

Speaker 1:          02:01          And there's, there's moments where it changes the course of the fight where it's really unfortunate. Um, you didn't referee Camaros, Mana Damien Maia, did you? I don't think so. Whoever did that one, we don't even have to pull it up, but there was a moment in the first round when Damien Maia got ahold of tomorrow and was trying to take his back standing and he had like one hook in a clench and he was hanging onto him and the referee decided not enough was taking place. They separated them. I'm like, Oh, you can't do that. So hard to get ahold of it wasn't me. Who did that Guy Damien Maia about to get you back and say, no, no, that's not going anywhere. That Sarah went crazy. You know he has that, um, that podcast he does what? Jim Norton and he's like, you just don't do that until the guy like he's, he's got a hold of him.

Speaker 1:          02:48          Like he might take his back here like, yeah, like in, you know, you saw what he did with lime and good when he takes your back. Yeah. In line with goods and pieced. But when Damien gets a hold, especially early in the round, right. And it's fresh and he's, he's got his back already and then any other lot of interesting take down from there too while he's like, he goes, goes back and forth with Taf way taking your back and then when your definitive take down he starts taking your back and when you go back then he's back working on yet. So now he works really, he works at a real interesting piece there, you know, it's stunning to watch him go through. Guys, like when he went through Rick story, I was like, Jesus Christ. Like Rick story's up powerful wrestler. Yeah. And when he takes his back and he gets them in that neck crank, and he seen the blood squirting out of his nose and like, Whoa, yeah, this is, this is a heavy fucking squeeze. This guy as, and then he did it to Carlos condit. Um, who else has done to, it's not a lot of guys. He gets a hold of you. It's just squeezes the life. And when he gets on top, he seems so heavy on Magni when he ran through Neil magnates like, oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's just such high level Jujitsu. You, he was on top. He's just just no air to smushes you.
