00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.280
As we launch into our final segment of Crash Course
Sociology, I’m sure one of the things that you’ve learned
by now is that sociology touches on everything.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:13.820
It helps us understand every aspect of society
– even those that we think are strictly personal,
like religion, sex, and gender.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.760
And the same is true for another aspect of
your personal life: your health, and how you
take care of it.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.360
Many of the factors that determine your health
aren’t biological, but are social and cultural.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.580
For example, research by Harvard sociologist
David Williams has shown that factors like

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.440
race and class, both social constructs, can
have profound effects on health outcomes.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:39.200
Sociologists also explore how the definition
of disease and illness has changed over time 
and varies across cultures.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.520
So just as health and medicine are regular parts
of your life as a social being, so is medical sociology.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:57.500
[Theme Music]

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.560
Medical sociology seeks to understand
the ways that society approaches and shapes
health, disease, and illness.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:12.660
And we need that understanding because, whether you
realize it or not, the diseases that society deems worthy
of research, or even treatment, vary across societies.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.820
In fact, how our society treats disease has
changed an awful lot just in the last century.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.300
And that brings us to medicine, the social institution
responsible for treating disease and restoring or
improving the health of a population.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.780
But the concept we have of medicine as a scientific
field is relatively new.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.920
So let’s go to the Thought Bubble for a brief
jaunt through the history of Western medicine.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.440
The so-called ‘father’ of Western medicine
was an ancient Greek by the name of Hippocrates

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.940
– yes the same Hippocrates that we get
the Hippocratic oath from –

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.440
credited as one of the first Western physicians to
believe that disease was the result of a person’s lifestyle
habits and the social environment in which they lived.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.600
The Hippocratic system of medicine was
based in humoral medicine, which remained in
use until the 18th century.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.760
Humoral medicine argued that all illnesses
stemmed from imbalances of the four humors
believed to make up the physical body:

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.900
black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.560
Under this theory of disease, if someone got
sick, you had to rebalance the humors.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.620
Got a fever?

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:14.240
Time to get some leeches since humoral medicine
says that you have too much blood.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.800
Humoral medicine dominated Western thinking,
even into the medieval ages, when medicine came
to have strong ties to religion.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:26.680
Many interpreted illness as a sign of God’s
disfavor, and cures often relied on prayer or
pilgrimages to a religious site.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.240
While medical practitioners of the day still used
humoral medicine, altering the body to cure diseases
was seen as tampering with God’s will.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.120
Over time, a more scientific approach to medical
treatment emerged, building on philosopher Rene
Descartes’ theory of mind-body dualism.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.620
This was a new belief that the body was separate
from the mind and the soul.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.660
And this allowed a scientific model of
medicine to emerge, applying the scientific
method to study and treat disease.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.680
In the same way that you can study an engine,
the thinking goes, you can also study anatomy
and physiology.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.420
And, yeah, there’s a Crash Course for that.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.700
And just as you can fix an engine when it
breaks down, if you understand what’s causing
dysfunction in the body, you can fix it –

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.320
without worrying that you were tampering
with the will of God.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.580
In 1847, the American Medical Association, or
AMA, was founded to promote a more systematic
approach to medical practice,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.860
by lobbying for Federal and state
regulations in medical training.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.860
The AMA also worked to set standards for the
professional practice of medicine.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:28.100
By incorporating a more scientific approach
to practicing medicine, the AMA helped shape
how we think about and treat disease.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.260
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.540
Now, just as how we study and treat disease
has changed throughout time, so has what we
consider ‘healthy.’

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.640
Rather than focusing only on the biology of health,
Medical Sociologists define Health as a state of
physical, mental, and social well-being.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:50.020
In this way, Health is a sociocultural
phenomenon, where the boundaries between
being ‘healthy’ and ‘unhealthy’ can vary a lot,

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.700
depending on who you are or where you
were raised.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.340
For example: How do you know when someone
is sick?

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.860
Sometimes, it’s easy to tell.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.700
When you can hear someone coughing and
sneezing from across room, it’s probably time to
pull out the Emergence-C and hand sanitizer.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.640
But other times, you can’t tell just by
looking or listening.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.519
Sometimes diseases, like lupus or diabetes,
don’t manifest with easily noticeable symptoms

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.260
– which means that people who seem visibly
healthy may still be sick.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.080
Sociologist Talcott Parsons, working within
a structural functionalist framework,

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.640
described the social and cultural responses
to disease through the concept of what he called
the Sick Role.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.280
Sick roles are the behaviors associated with
having an illness.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:34.740
To be seen as sick – and get the treatment
deserving of being sick – a person must act the
way society expects a sick person to behave.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:42.200
The function of the sick role is to create
a “social space” for non-normative social
behaviors related to being ill in society.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.650
So, you don’t get to stay home from school
just because you feel like it – you have to convince
your parents that you’re really sick.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.540
And unless you’ve got the stealth skills
of Ferris Bueller, that means following the
social norms expected of you:

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.940
staying in bed, eating chicken soup, sleeping
a lot, sniffling, and looking miserable.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.760
So the sick role comes with certain rights –
you get to skip out on your normal responsibilities,
and you’re not held responsible for being sick.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.160
People tend to believe that you aren’t faking
illness to shirk your duties.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.220
Again, unless: Ferris Bueller.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.520
But there are also some obligations associated
with sick roles.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.980
To be ‘properly’ sick, a person must want
to get better.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.580
They must also seek the care of medical professionals.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.620
When you fulfill the sick role, you get a pass on
the normal social behavior expected of well people.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.020
But if people don’t perceive you as being ‘properly’
sick, you might not get the same amount of slack.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:34.200
This is why people who have invisible illnesses
are often dismissed as just being lazy.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.360
Of course, not everyone with a disease plays
a sick role.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:44.400
Some diseases, like HIV/AIDS are heavily
stigmatized, compelling some people to hide
their illness and “pass” as being well.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.100
And sometimes, the medical professionals
that we depend on may refuse to accept our
claims of sickness,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.120
which basically withholds your
ability to engage in the sick role.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:59.720
There are other critiques of Parson’s sick role, but the
point here is that being “sick” is as much a social and
cultural experience as it is a biological dysfunction.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:07.940
Using another sociological paradigm, that of Symbolic
Interactionism, Medical Sociologists show how health,
disease, and illness are constructed by a society.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.200
Medicalization is the process of taking social
behaviors that are within the range of what
we’d consider typical,

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.580
and re-defining them as medical conditions
that need to be corrected.

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:22.800
For example, one of the more frequently
debated conditions is Attention Deficit,
Hyperactivity Disorder or ADHD,

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:27.820
a condition marked by an ongoing pattern of
inattention or hyperactivity and impulsive behavior.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:38.060
Since ADHD became recognized as a medical condition,
diagnoses have increased dramatically, going from
around 900,000 in 1990 to 10.9 million as of 2013.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.760
But people disagree about whether the growing
number of diagnoses for conditions such as ADHD

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:50.300
are the consequence of over-medicalization
of potentially disruptive social behaviors or are
just the result of under-diagnosis in the past.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:55.740
And, the boundary between a ‘legitimate’ medical
condition and a medicalized one isn’t always clear.

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.340
For example, there are shifting definitions
of what constitutes a disease.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.180
Usually it’s defined as a structural or
physical dysfunction of the body.

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:10.380
So doctors assess whether a person has a disease
by looking at their symptoms and using objectively
measurable data, like blood pressure or cell counts,

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:13.120
to determine if they match the profile
of a certain disease.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:20.400
But what constitutes a ‘disease’ is not uncontroversial,
and the parameters for determining whether someone
has one is politically contested.

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.720
Yes, politically!

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.160
Remember, sociology touches on everything!

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:31.380
One system used to define diagnoses is called
the International Classification of Diseases or ICD,
which has been in use since 1900.

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.700
It’s revised every 10 to 20 years based
on new data and changes in societal perspectives.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.900
Sometimes revisions remove prejudiced
and inaccurate definitions of disease,

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.680
such as the removal of homosexuality as a
mental health disorder from the ICD in 1992.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:51.480
Revisions can also expand disease parameters,
like when the diagnostic criteria for autism, Asperger’s
Syndrome, and other related disorders

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:59.360
was expanded to be called Autism Spectrum Disorder,
a category that encompasses a wider range of social
and behavioral disorders under one umbrella.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:03.360
This change was made based on improvements
in society’s understanding of the disorder.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:07.580
But it also reflects changes in American society’s
concern with these conditions.

00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.200
Now, another way Medical Sociologists approach
health is to look at illness.

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:16.660
It’s sometimes said that a person walks
into a doctor’s office with symptoms, but
leaves with a disease.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:22.760
While a disease defines a dysfunction of the
physical, an illness is the social and cultural
response to a disease.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.960
And your perception of an illness is likely
to vary a lot depending on who you are.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.720
People have what are called illness beliefs
– assumptions about the severity and nature
of symptoms.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:37.440
An illness belief doesn’t have to be accurate,
but the accuracy matters less than how the
beliefs make you feel.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:42.200
Illness beliefs help explain why some people seek
treatment for symptoms while others may ignore them.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.180
Or why some people strictly adhere to medical
advice, while others blow it off.

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.620
Factors like race, social class, gender, or age
can shape illness responses to disease as well.

00:08:51.620 --> 00:08:54.900
For example, women consult doctors
significantly more than men.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.440
Men are more likely to ignore pain, or downplay
the significance of symptoms.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.220
Social institutions can also influence illness
beliefs.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.200
Family is one of those social institutions.

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:07.540
Did your parents make a big fuss whenever
you got sick and let you stay home from school
at the drop of a hat?

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.560
Or were you raised to tough it out and not
miss school unless your arm fell off?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.740
For adults, your work environment can also
shape your illness response.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:19.070
In the United States, businesses are not required
to provide employees with paid sick leave.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.160
For people who aren’t able to take time off of
work without losing wages, or losing their job,

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.160
only the most severe symptoms might
make them admit that they’re really sick.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.200
More broadly, institutions within health
services – hospitals, insurance companies,
pharmaceutical companies –

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.860
play a major role in defining illness responses by:
1) defining what constitutes a disease, and

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.420
2) shaping who has access to
treatment.

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.500
All patients are not created equal in
the US healthcare system –

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:49.380
which patients get quality care varies by
social group and by how much our society
values certain diseases.

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.360
This, in turn, shapes illness responses and
illness behaviors.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.800
And so we end up right back where we started:

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.420
with the fact that Medical sociology helps us
to understand the ways that culture and society
shape health, disease, and illness.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:09.520
In today’s episode, we learned about what medical
sociology is and how Western approaches to medical
knowledge have changed throughout history.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:14.580
We then talked about what it means to be sick
and introduced the concept of the sick role.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.680
Next, we talked about how health, disease,
and illness are socially constructed.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:27.110
Finally, we talked about the distinction between
disease and illness and the individual and institutional
factors that influence a person’s beliefs about illness.

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:32.940
Next week we will explore Health Outcomes
in the United States and how these outcomes
are influenced by society.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:39.680
Crash Course Sociology is filmed in the Dr. Cheryl
