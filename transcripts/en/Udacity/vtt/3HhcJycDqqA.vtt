00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This unit is all about variance

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and one of its very close cousins, the standard deviation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Say you are a beginning college student,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
so your friends might be of the following ages:

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
17, 19, 18, 17, and 19.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:25.000
And you also have 5 close family members of ages 7, 38, 4, 23, and 18.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now for both you can compute the mean.

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Please enter the mean on the right side.
