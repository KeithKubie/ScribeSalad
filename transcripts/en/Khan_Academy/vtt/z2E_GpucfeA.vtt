00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.475
- [Instructor] We are
told, "Drag the sliders."

00:00:03.475 --> 00:00:05.383
And then they say, "Which
slider creates a scale

00:00:05.383 --> 00:00:06.968
"copy of the shape?"

00:00:06.968 --> 00:00:09.893
Or, "Which slider creates
scale copies of the shape?"

00:00:09.893 --> 00:00:11.392
So let's just see and
explore this a little bit.

00:00:11.392 --> 00:00:14.565
Okay, that's pretty neat,
these sliders seem to change

00:00:14.565 --> 00:00:18.382
the shape in some way,
and in different ways.

00:00:18.382 --> 00:00:21.835
So shape B right over
here, so it starts off,

00:00:21.835 --> 00:00:24.552
it looks like the width
is a little bit bigger

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:26.530
than the height, I'm just
trying to eyeball it,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.280
we don't know the exact numbers.

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.150
And so in order to create a scaled copy,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.357
you'd want to scale the
width, you'd want to scale

00:00:33.357 --> 00:00:36.810
this bottom side, and the top
side, and all of the sides.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.086
You'd want to scale by the same factor.

00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:41.396
But as we move this slider,
it seems like it's only

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:44.567
scaling the width, it's
not scaling the height.

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:46.917
So this slider, shape B right over here,

00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.032
the slider for shape B is not creating

00:00:49.032 --> 00:00:52.771
scale copies of itself, it's
only increasing the width,

00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:54.115
not the height.

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:56.835
While shape A, it looks
like it is increasing

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:59.589
both the width and the height,

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.096
so that would be a scale copy.

00:01:02.096 --> 00:01:05.992
So for example, that looks
like a scale copy of this,

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:07.372
which looks like a scale copy of this,

00:01:07.372 --> 00:01:09.492
which looks like a scale copy of that,

00:01:09.492 --> 00:01:11.046
which was our original shape.

00:01:11.046 --> 00:01:13.879
That is not a scaled copy of this.

00:01:14.721 --> 00:01:16.804
Let's do another example.

00:01:17.814 --> 00:01:20.128
So once again they say,
"Drag the sliders."

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:22.115
And they say, "Which
slider creates a scale copy

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.455
"of the shape?"

00:01:23.455 --> 00:01:25.166
All right, let's get shape A.

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:27.468
So this does look like we're scaling down,

00:01:27.468 --> 00:01:29.178
but we're scaling both
the width and the height

00:01:29.178 --> 00:01:32.134
by the same factor, so this shape A slider

00:01:32.134 --> 00:01:36.090
does look like it's creating
scale copies of the shape.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.088
B right over here, well
now we're only scaling,

00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:40.918
it looks like we're
only scaling the height,

00:01:40.918 --> 00:01:43.967
but not the width, so this
is not creating scale copies

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:45.622
of our original shape.

00:01:45.622 --> 00:01:48.754
It's elongating it, it's
increasing its height,

00:01:48.754 --> 00:01:50.254
but not the width.
