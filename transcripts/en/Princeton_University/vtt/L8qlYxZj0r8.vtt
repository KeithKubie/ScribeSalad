Shotaro Makisumi:
I got involved in cubing a really long time
ago. When I was nine, about, someone taught me how

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.310 position:66%
Shotaro Makisumi:
to solve a Rubik's cube, and at that time
I wasn't really using any advanced method.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.619 position:67%
Shotaro Makisumi:
I probably solved it in about 2 minutes. It
was after several months that I was getting

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.619 position:69%
Shotaro Makisumi:
high-20 seconds, and then I still had a long
road ahead to get down to 15 seconds.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:41.300
Shotaro Makisumi:
Yeah, it took a lot of practice.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:56.500 position:69%
Shotaro Makisumi:
I started the Rubik's Cube club at Princeton
in 2009, and I have a couple friends now who

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:02.670 position:73%
Shotaro Makisumi:
are speed cubers also on campus. We try to meet
every week and, usually, it is just cubing and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.469
Shotaro Makisumi:
having fun.

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.800 position:66%
Alan Chang:
When I came to Princeton, I was not really
surprised to find that there was a Rubik's

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.540 position:67%
Alan Chang:
Cube club here, because at that time there
were already a lot of Rubik's Cube clubs in

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.510 position:72%
Alan Chang:
the colleges near where I lived. And, the
fact that Macky goes to Princeton, I knew that

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:16.640
Alan Chang:
he must have started a club here.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.320 position:70%
Shotaro Makisumi:
I am expecting about 100 competitors for this
event. Among the pre-registered competitors,

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.560 position:73%
Shotaro Makisumi:
there is the current U.S. champion and a couple
of former and current world record holders.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:40.850 position:91%
Shotaro Makisumi:
There are also seven other countries, or nationalities,
represented, aside from the U.S. This competition is going

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.680 position:66%
Shotaro Makisumi:
to be one of the big ones this fall on the
East Coast.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:02:13.100

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:19.700 position:80%
Shotaro Makisumi:
I have always wanted to organize a big competition.
So, I think being a student organization here

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.420 position:78%
Shotaro Makisumi:
has really, really helped me to get this idea that
I had to come true.
