think because force awakens sort of
 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.180 align:start position:0%
think because force awakens sort of
started<00:11:20.450><c> this</c><00:11:20.930><c> and</c><00:11:21.350><c> then</c><00:11:21.830><c> now</c><00:11:21.950><c> we're</c><00:11:22.100><c> gonna</c>

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:22.190 align:start position:0%
started this and then now we're gonna
 

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.510 align:start position:0%
started this and then now we're gonna
