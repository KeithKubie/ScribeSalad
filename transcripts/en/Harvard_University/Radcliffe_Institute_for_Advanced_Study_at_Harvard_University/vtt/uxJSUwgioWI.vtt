00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.500
- Well, hello, everyone.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.636
I'm Yukio Lippit the
faculty director of the Arts

00:00:10.636 --> 00:00:11.760
at the Radcliffe Institute.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.800
And it's my real pleasure
to welcome all of you

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.070
to this special event, the
opening of an exhibition

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.140
by the artist the
Xaviera Simmons,

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.440
titled Overlay in the
Johnson-Kulukundis Family

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.150
Gallery at Radcliffe.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.470
Now the genesis of the
exhibition by Xaviera Simmon,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.680
that opens today, can be located
in the Institute's desire

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.650
to conceive of a show that
resonated with the Radcliffe's

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.020
research theme for
the year-- urbanism.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.090
This led us to explore
a collaboration

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.337
with the Cambridge
Arts Council, which

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:43.920
had been organizing a series of
installations and performances

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.620
by contemporary artists to
celebrate the first remodeling

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.110
and revisioning of
the Cambridge Common

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
in a generation, one that's
curated by Dina Deitsch.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.710
Now this series is organized
under the title the Commons--

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.517
Art in the Cambridge Commons
and is slated to begin in May.

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:00.600
And we'll hear more about
this in the conversation

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.700
with the artist that follows.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.170
But because the
Radcliffe Institute

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.300
is adjacent to the
Cambridge Common,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.750
we wanted to find a
way, an artistic way,

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.229
of exploring and opening
up this adjacency

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.270
and by extension of opening
up the Institute more

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.490
generally to understand
further in ways

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.390
that are creative,
imaginative, even surprising--

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.800
its resources, its
archives-- of quarrying

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.410
further the relationship
of its history

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.240
to the contemporary world.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.400
And in this regard, we have
found the ideal collaborator,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.640
Xaviera Simmons, and
feel very fortunate

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.840
to be where we are today,
opening the exhibition.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.580
Simmons is a highly
acclaimed artist

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.550
whose work dynamically combines
photographs, instillations,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.670
performance, sound, sculpture,
and other multimedia

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.860
components.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.630
These various aspects
are placed in kind

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.540
of a perpetual symbiotic
relationship in which they

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.300
are mutually informing
and enriching and cycling

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.980
through one another to
generate remarkable new worlds.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.620
Simmons' artistry is
formally beautiful and highly

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.460
crafted in terms of its
formal elements-- composition,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.199
color, scale, and so forth.

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:09.449
And we're convinced that
you'll agree with us when you

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:11.820
enter into the gallery space.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.750
But this remarkable,
formal beauty

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.010
is not necessarily the artist's
only or even primary concern.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.950
You might call one of
her primary concerns

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.020
the characters, that complex
characters, that she layers

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.610
into existence, characters
that are palimpsests

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:35.400
of historical figures and
contemporary concerns placed

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.030
within various unlocatable
landscapes, that

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.750
are urban, rural, or
natural, and that participate

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.690
in open ended
non-linear narratives,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.300
much like actors in a play or
vignette for which the script

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.880
is no longer available.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.750
It is because of this ambiguity
that these personations,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.250
as we like to call
them-- accretions

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.190
of specific types of
experience and memory

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.260
and lived history--
become a springboard

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.630
for further
engagement and insight

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.450
into the relationship
between what we assume

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.390
to be the relationship between
the archive and the past,

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.110
how one understands the inner
lives of historical figures,

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.370
and ultimately and importantly
the contemporary world itself.

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.890
Simmons received a
bachelor in fine arts

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.350
from Bard College in 2004.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.540
She completed the Whitney
museum's independent study

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.750
program in studio art in
2005 while undertaking

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.100
a two-year actor training
conservatory with the Maggie

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.035
Flanagan Studio.

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.160
And this training in acting
and directing, I think,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.380
is a very important
part of her practice

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.400
overall, mutually informing
other aspects of her work.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.740
She's exhibited and performed
in a wide range of major venues,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.940
including the Museum of
Modern Art, PS1, the Studio

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.770
Museum in Harlem,
the contemporary arts

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.200
museum in Houston, the Public
Art Fund, The Sculpture Center.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.300
She's also the recipient
of many prizes,

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.410
including the David Driscoll
prize, the Jerome Foundation

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.760
Travel Fellowship, an Arts
Matters Fellowship Smart Power

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:04.730
Fellowship.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.270
In 2012, Simmons was
an artist in residence

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.280
at the Studio Museum in Harlem.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.860
And in 2015, she
received the Foundation

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.800
for Contemporary Arts Grant.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.730
Now at the Radcliffe Institute,
her exhibition, Overlay,

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.040
is rooted in the
stories, images,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.620
and historical narratives
found amidst the archives

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.140
of the Radcliffe Institute
Schlesinger Library

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.570
on the history of
women in America.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.840
The artist engages with a set
of Schlesinger collections

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.710
that resonate with
longstanding explorations--

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:38.620
cookbooks, first person
travel narratives,

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.730
images of women at work,
architects, works about health,

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.770
among many others.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.810
Simmons distills this
multitude of voices

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.660
and places them in a
new contextual space,

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.580
overlaying diverse languages
of which there are many,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.760
which you will be
introduced to in the show

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:57.100
in presenting a diverse
cross-section of figures

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:01.450
to enliven and inhabit the
landscape of the gallery.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.460
In doing so, Simmons
not only explores

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.220
alternative possibilities for
the figures in the archives,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.240
but repopulates the Schlesinger
itself with new voices.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.980
Now as I mentioned
earlier, Overlay

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.310
is part of a collaboration
between the Radcliffe arts

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.269
program and the
Cambridge Arts Council,

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:19.060
whose summer series on
the Cambridge Common

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.250
will feature a performance
created by Simmons based

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.870
on the exhibition.

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:25.720
Now before inviting
the artist on stage

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.190
for a discussion
of her work, I'd

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:28.690
like to mention
that we'll be having

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.050
a reception after the
discussion for which we will all

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.290
move from here to Byerly Hall,
which is where the gallery is

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.047
located two buildings down from
here to celebrate the opening

00:05:41.047 --> 00:05:42.880
and give you a chance
to experience the show

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.980
and meet the artist.

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.570
I'd also like to
take the opportunity,

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.130
because so many
people were involved

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:50.680
in putting the show
together, to thank,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.560
on behalf of Rebecca Wassarman,
the director of Academic

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.890
Ventures, and Meg Rotzel,
our arts program manager,

00:05:56.890 --> 00:06:00.940
a number of people who are
crucial to the realization

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.640
of this exhibition.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:04.920
We'd like to thank
Sean Weely, a PhD

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.670
candidate in the history
of art department

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:09.250
here at Harvard who was
Xaviera's research assistant

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.320
and crucial to the show.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.710
Our gallery proprietor
Joe Zane imbued the show

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.960
with his own masterful
artistry in helping

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.500
to consummate the installation,
Jennifer Birkhead, who

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.610
coordinated virtuosically the
translators and speakers that

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.670
are a crucial part
of the show, as well.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:30.820
I would like to think Deanna
Carey and the Schlesinger

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.000
staff who were so
helpful and enabled

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.210
so much the research that
went into the personations

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.400
that we'll be
witnessing later on,

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.830
Benjamin Shaffer, who lent
much of his time and energy

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.940
to our efforts and finally
to Xaviera herself, who

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:49.420
along with masterful
artistry and intelligence

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:51.700
brought so much
goodwill and generosity

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.180
and enthusiasm to the show
and gave us a new sense

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.400
of what it means to
collaborate with an artist.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.306
We are profoundly
grateful to you, Xaviera.

00:07:01.306 --> 00:07:02.680
Now our conversation
this evening

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.600
will be joined by
Dina Deitsch, who

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.750
is the curator of the Commons
Art in the Cambridge commons

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.060
and is also the John
R. and Barbara Robinson

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.910
family interim director of the
Carpenter Center for the Visual

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:14.200
Arts at Harvard.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.420
Previously she was the
curator of contemporary art

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.810
at the deCordova
Sculpture Park and Museum

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.630
and has taught and
lectured widely,

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.070
including currently as a guest
lecturer at the Massachusetts

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:25.240
College of Art and Design.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.698
And her record of achievement
in the contemporary art world

00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:28.776
is extensive.

00:07:28.776 --> 00:07:31.150
And she was instrumental in
the organization of the show.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:32.770
So we're very grateful
to her, and we're

00:07:32.770 --> 00:07:34.478
delighted that she'll
participate with us

00:07:34.478 --> 00:07:35.800
in this public conversation.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.020
So without further
ado, please join me

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.350
in welcoming Deena Deitsch and
our featured artist Xaviera

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:42.386
Simmons to the stage.

00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:55.120
- Well, there's so much to
talk about about your show

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.440
and your artworks, Xaviera.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:58.720
And so I wanted to begin
with your experience

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.240
with the Radcliffe
Archives itself--

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:04.140
what you focused on, what
caught your attention.

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:07.060
- Hi, everybody.

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:08.800
It's so nice to be
here, of course.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.250
And I'll just
reiterate-- thanks again

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:17.990
to Yukio, Deena, Meg, Sean,
and Becky-- everybody,

00:08:17.990 --> 00:08:21.800
Jen, beautiful faces here.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.400
So I'm really
thankful to be here.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:27.250
So I wanted to say that.

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:28.930
OK, I'm here.

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.550
So tell me the question, again.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.090
- Yeah, sure.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:36.250
The Radcliffe Archives--
what caught your attention?

00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.993
Tell us about your experiences.

00:08:37.993 --> 00:08:43.480
- Yeah, so I had just come off
of doing a project in New York

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.240
City first with the high line,
Friends of the High Line,

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.760
and then with the
kitchen in New York City.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.370
And in that project
I had been looking

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:58.090
at a lot of archival images.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:01.201
Archive, that's such a
strange word these days now.

00:09:01.201 --> 00:09:02.950
But I had been looking
at a lot of images,

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.210
a lot of homoerotic
imagery, a lot of gestures.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:10.590
I'd also produced my
first choreographic work.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:13.090
And this is pre-election.

00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:15.490
So I came to the
archives thinking

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:24.580
a lot about first gesture still
and then what the Schlesinger

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.820
archive had inside of it.

00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:30.640
It's a really
first step curious.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.980
And then, for me,
the process goes

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:38.640
that I think about the language
that the archive puts out

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.570
there, like what does the
sc advertise of itself,

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.090
what does it talk about?

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:51.120
And it talks a lot
about women's things,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:59.670
like Feminism with a big F or
feminist marches or cooking.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.290
I remember coming in seeing
things about Julia Child,

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:08.280
and then, going a little deeper,
and I saw protest buttons

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.870
and then going a little deeper.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:14.090
And then I saw, oh, wait
there's a huge travel section.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:18.900
A little deeper-- there's
travel and affluence.

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.327
And then there's this
whole section of images.

00:10:21.327 --> 00:10:23.160
And then, going a little
deeper, and there's

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.260
like these female
photojournalists.

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:27.240
And then, going a little
deeper, and there's

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:35.670
this like amazing BDSM archive
that the Schlesinger collected.

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:37.840
And then going deeper,
and there's porn in there

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.360
and constantly going deeper.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.870
And so I started off with
a cursory look, oh, wow--

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.310
feminism, protests,
which is pretty deep.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:52.740
But there's so much in there.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:54.630
There's really a
beautiful collection

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.010
of women and sexuality,
which I was probably really

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:04.500
excited about, I think, because
I had been thinking about that

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.790
from my show at the kitchen.

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.020
So it just was natural to
look for it along with themes

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.190
that I already think about in
my work, which is landscape,

00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:15.960
which is what's
underneath landscape

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.720
and that American history.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.480
And that's how I begin.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.430
- Could we follow up
on that a little bit?

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.080
You have talked
in the past about

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.480
the interesting
dialectical relationship

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.390
between an archive, which is
so orderly on the outside--

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.630
that it's very clean and
arranged in a way, of course

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:35.430
systematically to
allow us to access it--

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.497
but that there is this
inherent messiness of the lives

00:11:39.497 --> 00:11:40.080
they-- are in.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.790
And you also have
a real interest

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:46.050
in bringing out the
kind of sensuality

00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:48.390
of the archive, the
seams that you hit,

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.200
which are really
about the inner lives

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.630
of the subjects of the archive.

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.441
Could you talk a little bit
more about your interest

00:11:57.441 --> 00:11:58.065
in these areas?

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:04.170
- I think archives are sort of--

00:12:04.170 --> 00:12:05.430
that word.

00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:08.520
Every time I say it, I
feel tripped up with it

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:12.480
because I think, in terms
of art making, that's

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.490
like one of those buzz words.

00:12:14.490 --> 00:12:18.030
So I don't know
how to describe it.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.840
It is an archive technically.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.040
But it's really like collections
of people's items and things.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:29.550
So I remember one
time Luke [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:32.040
wrote about my work, about
a series of photographs

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:32.790
that I produced.

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.380
And he was like, I see
a lot of dead people,

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:42.120
because I use a lot of
old images and images

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:47.550
from the 70s, 80s 60s in some
of my sculptural photographs.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.190
And so I can't help
but go into an archive

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:54.570
and feel the dead people.

00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.420
But at the same time, that's
the first layer right.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.980
That's like getting the box
that the library gives you

00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:03.480
to research that you ask for.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:08.840
But then once you start to
go through the contents of so

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:09.870
and so's life--

00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.475
it's not all dead
people, but a lot--

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.190
obviously they
start to come alive.

00:13:17.190 --> 00:13:22.800
I looked at a few
different travel

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.910
writers and female
journalists, photo journalists.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:30.780
The first female
photojournalist, her archives

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:31.770
are here.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.030
And you really see
a woman whose life

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:40.650
took her from Cambridge
through all different parts

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:41.320
of the world.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.590
So she started to
become alive to me.

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.530
And I just went on
her journey with her.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.560
I was coming here for--

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.180
I don't know-- six months.

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:55.800
So I just kept feeling first
the weight of this person

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.970
is not here anymore.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:13:59.700
And so I'm able to look
through their things,

00:13:59.700 --> 00:14:06.600
their private thoughts, their
private images, and then slowly

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.730
those private thoughts
started to give me

00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:10.740
life in terms of
thinking about making

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:11.995
an exhibition in the space.

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.140
- Archive is a difficult word.

00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:19.270
It's something more
like a living repository

00:14:19.270 --> 00:14:23.350
of memories and experiences that
you are engaging and finding

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.590
a lot of future possibility
with in general.

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:30.250
But there's also an
interesting timeline

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:34.120
to your engagement with
the Radcliffe repository

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:37.120
of memories and
experiences, which

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.500
is that, when we engaged you
and when Deena engaged you

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.780
for the commons project,
it was some time

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:50.060
in the middle of last year.

00:14:50.060 --> 00:14:52.460
And since then, the world
has changed quite a bit.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:55.690
And there is an
interesting relationship

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.460
that you've articulated between
your work in the repository,

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:02.710
in these other people's
lives and memories,

00:15:02.710 --> 00:15:06.310
in that kind of memory space
and what's going on externally

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.490
and how they mutually
inflect one another.

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:12.880
- Yeah I think we
started talking--

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.920
I don't remember
what month, Deena--

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.080
summer of 2016.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.870
So that was pre where we are.

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:28.190
And I had a certain--

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:31.700
I don't want to say that I
was complacent because I don't

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:35.630
think, as a woman in my body--

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.660
a black woman, artist--

00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:43.180
I don't know that I'm ever
complacent because it's

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:47.060
a restless space this
being American here, being

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.590
a black American here.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:50.450
So it's a restless space for me.

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:55.970
But I definitely think that the
hairs on every part of my body

00:15:55.970 --> 00:16:00.260
have been raised substantially
since the election

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.670
of the gentleman.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:11.050
So I was doing a lot of
research and coming to Cambridge

00:16:11.050 --> 00:16:13.250
and coming to the library
and coming to Radcliffe

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:15.380
and interacting
with these archives.

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.420
But at the same time,
there were so many things

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:19.610
happening so quickly,
and there are.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:26.970
We're only 100 days into a
conversation or monologue.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:33.211
So I couldn't help
but hear both sides,

00:16:33.211 --> 00:16:35.210
which is something I was
talking to the students

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.530
about earlier today.

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.660
There's like two sides.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.810
There's the roots of the
tree and then the leaves

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:42.620
of the tree.

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:46.520
And I guess the archives kind
of like started to become

00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.810
the roots of the tree.

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:53.480
And then the monologue
and all of its branches

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.450
started to be the
tops of the tree.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.900
And that's what started to
happen to me as I was thinking

00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:02.240
about the exhibition--
was, well, I

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.650
want to maintain the
conversation that we proposed

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:09.589
in the beginning, which was
thinking about the archives

00:17:09.589 --> 00:17:13.130
and thinking about how
to distill language

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:15.920
from the archives,
but I also had

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.980
to start paying attention
to what was happening here

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:21.319
and also what was
happening here at Harvard.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:26.589
I was really impressed
with the slavery--

00:17:26.589 --> 00:17:28.114
correct me with
the correct term.

00:17:28.114 --> 00:17:29.780
- The University and
Slavery Conference.

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:33.390
- University and
Slavery Conference.

00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:35.960
So I touch on that
in the exhibition.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.510
And that had to do with
my newfound friendship

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.450
with Meg, who told me about it.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:44.450
And I had to touch on that.

00:17:44.450 --> 00:17:47.420
So that's like the branches
right and all the flora

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:50.960
of the tree-- was like what's
happening now actually here.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:54.400
And then there's
obviously the historical

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.630
that had to maintain.

00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:59.150
So I think you'll see in
the exhibition there's

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:04.652
like this kind of push and
pull between then and now.

00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:06.470
- Xaviera, I wanted to jump in.

00:18:06.470 --> 00:18:08.840
I think it's
interesting that image

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.970
that you chose for the
marketing and that we're

00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:12.050
looking at tonight.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.150
It's not in the show per se.

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:16.280
But I love that this
is the image that

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.930
led you to your entire project.

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:20.870
And I'll let you talk about the
installation as you would like.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.250
Or there could be
a great reveal.

00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:24.080
But it's interesting
about how you

00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:25.910
move through the
cookbooks, the Julia

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:28.160
Child-- we had a lot of
conversations about cookbooks.

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.736
I think that was our big draw.

00:18:29.736 --> 00:18:30.860
We were like, look at that.

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:32.980
And BDMs, that was a big one.

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:33.480
- BDSM.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.870
- Oh, BDSM, sorry.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:36.920
Outrageous--

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.560
- Outrageous Women.

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.260
Does anyone know
Outrageous Women?

00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:42.950
It's amazing.

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:49.880
It was produced in Cambridge
from like 1986 to '88,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.540
I believe.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:53.630
And it's a zeen.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:55.700
I think there were
only 12 issues.

00:18:55.700 --> 00:19:02.150
And the whole stack is in the
library in the Schlesinger

00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.020
Library.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:08.360
And it's little thin
pages, but it was right--

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:13.520
I guess it was 80s, but pre
the onslaught of AIDS right.

00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:16.160
So it was it women run.

00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:23.440
It was a women run sexual
awareness magazine,

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.920
specifically dealing with
bondage and Cambridge.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.170
So really, really interesting.

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.420
And these women's imaginations--

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.140
and it's weird.

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.570
I looked up the author
late a while ago.

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.120
And there's only
one image of her.

00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.480
But there's no image.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.560
She has a Facebook page,
but it's like a cat.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:46.670
So she went from being tying
women up and all this stuff

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:47.360
and writing--

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.450
she was the publisher and one
of the writers-- tying women up

00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:54.170
to now she's like the cat lady.

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:55.084
I've looked for her.

00:19:55.084 --> 00:19:56.000
I'm like, where is it?

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.500
She still lives in Cambridge.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:59.420
She's got cats on her page.

00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:00.080
I'm like, ah.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:04.010
I don't know how you do that.

00:20:07.066 --> 00:20:08.440
- So I was wondering
if you might

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:09.981
want to talk about
the image that you

00:20:09.981 --> 00:20:12.800
did she choose in a little bit.

00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:15.580
Although Cambridge--
and what was it--

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.530
bondage and Cambridge will
stay in my mind forever.

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.270
The story and the
narrative that you did

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:26.020
end up choosing, which seems
so timely about the moment

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.920
we're in and the piece that
you ended up producing.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.970
- So this image is
from Mary McNally,

00:20:33.970 --> 00:20:36.400
who was a photographer.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.850
She doesn't have a huge
archive or a huge folder

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:40.510
in the library.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:44.640
But she has a really substantial
and significant one to me

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:51.340
in that she photographed
a 1980 UN conference.

00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:53.470
So I originally thought
the installation

00:20:53.470 --> 00:20:56.380
was going to be a lot
about images of travel

00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.690
and a conversation
about the opportunities

00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:04.240
that affluent
women had to travel

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.420
and then how to distill that.

00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:10.000
But it really became about
looking at these images--

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.880
these are two of her images--
looking at her images

00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.220
and thinking about how powerful
the images were, especially

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:21.670
they were taken in 1980,
and where we were today.

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:23.350
And I couldn't let it go.

00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:25.444
I was like, this looks
like an image that was-- it

00:21:25.444 --> 00:21:26.860
was right during
the women's march

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.800
when I think I made
this photograph.

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.670
Or those are not my slides--

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:35.080
but that I decided that
that should be the cover.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.770
Because she really
paid attention

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:41.440
to every single moment
that was happening

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.880
during this conference.

00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:44.860
So I just thought
of the conference

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:51.100
as the foundation for the
exhibition and as the vessel

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.440
to hold all of the
languages and narratives

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.229
that I wanted to build
inside of that installation.

00:21:57.229 --> 00:21:59.270
- Well, can we talk a
little bit more about that?

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:03.610
Because, again, you have
this interesting relationship

00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:07.600
temporarily between
the time frames

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:11.140
of these lives and histories
that you're examining

00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:12.980
and then that
contemporary moment.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.680
And this conference
is also something

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.710
that resonates with your
understanding of the landscape

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:20.200
of Radcliffe, your experience
of the University and Slavery

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:21.430
Conference.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.959
The exhibition itself takes
on the format of a conference

00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:25.750
in a certain sense.

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.420
It's a conceit of a conference
through the instrument

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:32.832
and official language of the
conference you promulgate.

00:22:32.832 --> 00:22:34.540
Could you could you
say a little bit more

00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.520
about how you understand the
conference as a landscape

00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.270
or setting for
your installation?

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:45.740
- That's interesting.

00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:47.940
I took the idea
of a conference--

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.440
it's weird.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.140
That word conference is another
word like archive I feel--

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.740
in my studio practice.

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.780
It's very filled with a lot
of bureaucratic language.

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:08.750
And it's very off
putting in a way.

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.860
It's so microscopic--
is that the word when

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.420
you want to look really close?

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:17.060
It's both microscopic
and macroscopic.

00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.030
Are those the two words
when you go down and then

00:23:20.030 --> 00:23:21.180
when you go out?

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:22.892
Is that microscopic,
macroscopic?

00:23:22.892 --> 00:23:24.250
- Well, we understand.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.790
- You know I'm talking about.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:26.860
So I don't know.

00:23:26.860 --> 00:23:31.520
Conferences do both things
simultaneously I find.

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:33.470
I'm not sure that
conferences really come

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:36.110
to any kind of
conclusion-- is the thing.

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:42.700
And so that was really what
I keyed in on-- was I wanted

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.460
to make a conference,
which you'll see--

00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:48.280
I wanted to begin to construct
a conference that actually

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.700
had an opinion, I felt,
that actually came

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:58.150
to some kind of conclusion
and actually promoted society

00:23:58.150 --> 00:24:01.990
that I felt was more
progressive in its language

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:06.520
than where we are now and
also where we were in 1980.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.980
So I used her images
as the foundation

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.660
to build another conference,
another idea of a conference.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:22.860
It's still an official
language in terms

00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:24.330
of if you read the text.

00:24:24.330 --> 00:24:31.530
But I invited 17 speakers,
interpreters, to interpret

00:24:31.530 --> 00:24:32.640
the text that I wrote--

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.080
so there was like 17
different languages--

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.870
so that they could
add another element

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:45.030
to this American landscape,
bringing other languages

00:24:45.030 --> 00:24:46.830
to the forefront
that, therefore,

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:52.290
were populating the conference
with a diverse population

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.560
of women.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.700
- Can we, maybe just
for the audience,

00:24:56.700 --> 00:25:01.170
mention that the sound component
is a very important one

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:02.070
for the exhibition?

00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:04.680
And you'll hear,
as Xaviera said,

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.410
many different languages,
including Yiddish, Amharic

00:25:07.410 --> 00:25:10.290
Yoruba, French, Spanish,
Portuguese, Mandarin, Haitian,

00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:13.230
Creole, Jamaican, Patois,
Hebrew, Farsi, Arabic,

00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:17.200
Hindi, and Japanese, translated
and spoken by some individuals,

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:22.110
I think, who are in
this room with us today.

00:25:22.110 --> 00:25:25.020
This is such a rich and
interesting and remarkable

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:25.890
array of languages.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.860
But could you say a little bit
about the logic of selection?

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:32.610
- Well, first I started thinking
a lot about Trump's travel

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:35.010
ban, the Muslim ban.

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:38.340
And I had to think about Arabic.

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:41.190
I could not let that go.

00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:44.460
And I actually talked
a lot about those.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.700
In the text of the conference,
which you'll see on the video,

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.590
I actually continuously--

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.720
well, I think four
or five times--

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:57.870
put those countries
that he tried to ban--

00:25:57.870 --> 00:26:01.200
I don't even know
where we're at--

00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:02.205
in the text.

00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.100
So that's one language set.

00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:11.370
And then I have a
personal relationship

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:14.970
to Amharic, which is just
because family member--

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.300
really close friends
are from Ethiopia.

00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:20.670
I think it's a
language that you don't

00:26:20.670 --> 00:26:24.120
hear very often in
America unless you

00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.680
go to certain enclaves.

00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.750
I also live with my partner
who speaks four languages--

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.780
besides English-- three
languages fluently.

00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:39.660
And so I'm constantly
aware of how language--

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.280
I've watched him travel.

00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:47.550
And when he goes to France, he's
very kind of stiff and tight.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.860
And then, when we travel to
Italy, he's very like loose.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:54.000
He gets into the--

00:26:56.604 --> 00:26:58.110
he uses the language.

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:00.300
And then when he
travels to Spain--

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:01.864
that's his favorite language.

00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:03.280
And I know when
he speaks Spanish,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.940
that that's the
one that feels most

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:08.040
passionate and sensual to him.

00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:12.120
And so I carry that with
me in a lot of my work.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:15.720
And actually my
first projects that

00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:21.550
were multilingual I used him
as the model for the project.

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:27.680
So I like hearing
multiple languages.

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:35.330
I think Yoruba-- one
out of every seven

00:27:35.330 --> 00:27:38.370
African on the continent
is born in Nigeria.

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.090
So I really thought it
was important to have

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:44.540
Yoruba in the dialogue.

00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:49.490
each: country in Africa
has 20 different dialects.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:51.360
I can't own them all.

00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.560
But I could try to put
some of them in there.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.490
Then, it was important for me
to have a language like Yiddish

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:02.890
because I kept asking everyone
who speaks Yiddish anymore.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.422
Is it a living language?

00:28:04.422 --> 00:28:05.380
And that was a conver--

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:06.160
you do?

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.475
- My parents do.

00:28:08.475 --> 00:28:10.070
- It's rare, though, right?

00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:10.830
- Yeah, it's rare.

00:28:10.830 --> 00:28:11.400
It's smaller.

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.860
- Yeah, it's rare.

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.950
And I couldn't let go
of Hebrew, Yiddish.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:18.940
I was like, they both
need to be in there.

00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:22.315
They both need to live
and exist together.

00:28:22.315 --> 00:28:23.940
And I think that has
to do with looking

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.830
at a lot of the terrain of
some of the writers and travel

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:31.320
writers inside of the
archives that I was looking at

00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:38.010
and who reigned supreme in a way
inside of the narrative, inside

00:28:38.010 --> 00:28:40.267
of the narrative of the
archive that I was looking at.

00:28:40.267 --> 00:28:41.850
- Well, I think this
jumps very nicely

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:43.300
to this idea of landscape.

00:28:43.300 --> 00:28:45.690
And the way you
describe language

00:28:45.690 --> 00:28:49.200
is really a form of embodying
a landscape in a different way,

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:52.860
about bringing different areas
of the globe into one sight,

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:56.200
thinking about Cambridge as a
global sight in and of itself,

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200
thinking about the
internationalism of this UN

00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:00.060
conference of the 1980s.

00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:02.910
And this sort of goes back
to the original invitation

00:29:02.910 --> 00:29:06.000
where I invited you to
come to do performances

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.740
on the Cambridge
Common, thinking

00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:10.770
about this overarching
project about how we can bring

00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.690
performance into public
art contexts that

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:15.270
were about this notion
of connectivity.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:17.760
The Cambridge Common,
as a lot of us

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.350
who live here or have lived
here for the last several years

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:22.600
know that it's been under
renovation for three years--

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:23.940
and then they opened it up.

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:25.650
And we're like, oh,
there's new pathways.

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.191
That's great.

00:29:26.191 --> 00:29:28.020
Wow, that took a long time.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:29.290
But it's very beautiful.

00:29:29.290 --> 00:29:30.570
So we must celebrate it.

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:33.480
And so what better way to do
so than with real avant-garde

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.800
practices.

00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:38.280
And knowing your
past work at MoMA

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.287
and your other work
at the High Line

00:29:40.287 --> 00:29:42.120
thinking about that as
an artist that you've

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:45.900
worked with archives as
a performative material

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.710
in and of itself as
a score, as a script.

00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:51.390
You became the immediate
artist to invite.

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:53.760
And of course Radcliffe
as a neighbor-- thinking

00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.590
about these notions
of connectivity,

00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.140
how to bring them, as
Yukkio so nicely mentioned,

00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.930
thinking about the archive
that's here in the Schlesinger,

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.680
here at Radcliffe, out into
the comment, which is so close,

00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:07.890
yet psychologically and
logistically a fairly different

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.180
space at the same time.

00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:11.640
So I don't know if
you want to talk

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.420
a little bit about that next
iteration of this project

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.940
because the really beautiful
gallery installation

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.830
that you've opened tonight--

00:30:19.830 --> 00:30:21.360
and then later on
in about a month,

00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:24.780
we'll start doing performances,
which will have a relationship

00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.770
but fairly different
at the same level.

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.340
- I really have to thank
Deena and Yukkio and Meg

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:36.020
and Becky and Sean, again, and
Jen for their patience with me

00:30:36.020 --> 00:30:43.100
because I tackle a few
different types of practices,

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.160
it takes me a while to--

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.330
I'm like a hawk.

00:30:47.330 --> 00:30:49.130
I oversee.

00:30:49.130 --> 00:30:51.200
I look over a landscape.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:54.350
And then I slowly start
to pinpoint-- that's it.

00:30:59.590 --> 00:31:02.380
It's like a ping.

00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:07.450
I recognize that that's what's
the most important thing that

00:31:07.450 --> 00:31:10.270
should come up or that's what's
the most important topic.

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:17.230
And so they've really let
me have a very fertile time

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.460
in the archive.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:24.190
So I originally planned
on producing more

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:27.850
like a tour in the Commons.

00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:29.440
First, we were
thinking of movement.

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.780
And then I sort of
settled in on a score,

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:35.590
a tour inside of the Commons.

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:37.990
But then we had this
really interesting moment

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:40.930
where we went to the
Cambridge Historical Society.

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:43.990
And it really changed my whole
perspective of the Commons

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:48.940
because one thing that
the young man said who--

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.270
he basically has
resurrected the Commons.

00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:56.110
Or is he like main
gatekeeper of the Commons?

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:58.069
- Debatable.

00:31:58.069 --> 00:31:59.860
But I think it's also
great that you called

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.180
Charlie Selvin a young man.

00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:03.910
I think he'll be very
excited to hear that.

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.320
They've been varied
in the last 30 years.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.930
It's been a very carefully
maintained landscape,

00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:10.720
historicized very carefully so.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.630
So we had a lot of
conversations about why

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.250
the Common feels so lonely.

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:16.736
It has a very empty quality.

00:32:16.736 --> 00:32:17.860
I think people come and go.

00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:19.750
It has a very
commuter feel to it.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.421
But it had a history in the 60s
of being a radical gathering

00:32:23.421 --> 00:32:23.920
sight.

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.140
That's where people
came to protest.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.859
That's where you would go
if you wanted to protest.

00:32:28.859 --> 00:32:30.150
Now when people go to protest--

00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.980
I see a lot of people
on the front hall

00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.980
of City Hall on Mass.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.000
Ave. They go to Boston.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.950
I don't know if
anybody protested

00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:41.420
in the last several months
in January on the Common.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.947
It's very quiet.

00:32:42.947 --> 00:32:45.280
And so there was this question
that we were bringing up.

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.160
And when you went to visit
it, why is it that way?

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:50.230
And so there were
multiple answers.

00:32:50.230 --> 00:32:53.080
Some people said getting
gathering permits were

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.589
really difficult suddenly.

00:32:54.589 --> 00:32:56.380
And then at the Cambridge
Historic Society,

00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:58.005
they were like, no,
people just stopped

00:32:58.005 --> 00:32:59.560
asking to use the space.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:02.560
So there was a bit of a
question of what happened.

00:33:02.560 --> 00:33:04.550
And they actually had
renovated the Common

00:33:04.550 --> 00:33:07.390
in the 70s to allow for
a greater gathering.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:10.714
And then their experience
at the Historic Society

00:33:10.714 --> 00:33:12.130
and in the city--
they said, well,

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.160
people just stop doing it
like after a certain point

00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.100
in the early 70s.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:18.520
People weren't gathering
to protest anymore.

00:33:18.520 --> 00:33:21.550
And it just fell out
of the everyday action.

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:24.040
- Well, it also fell
out because I guess--

00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:30.330
I don't think folks can
afford to stay in Cambridge

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.580
and live here and claim it.

00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:39.810
And that was the my main
takeaway from the experience.

00:33:39.810 --> 00:33:42.750
It's a transient
community in a way,

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:45.150
which is very similar to MoMA.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:50.850
That's a smaller community
but in the sense that--

00:33:50.850 --> 00:33:51.690
it seems as though.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:52.350
I don't live here.

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:54.660
I know there are people who've
lived here for many years

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.035
and are probably
in the audience.

00:33:56.035 --> 00:33:57.870
But from what
Charlie was saying,

00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:59.610
it seems as though
people live here

00:33:59.610 --> 00:34:02.310
for a time to continue
their education

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.530
and maybe start families.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:05.850
But then they move elsewhere.

00:34:05.850 --> 00:34:10.170
So you don't have this sense
of ownership of this space.

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.239
And that's what
really stuck to me.

00:34:12.239 --> 00:34:17.040
And the project that
I'm doing is not

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:18.659
by any means owning the space.

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.500
But I hope that it at least
leaves an imprint on people's

00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:23.830
memories of this space.

00:34:23.830 --> 00:34:31.530
So it's going to be six
women inside of the space

00:34:31.530 --> 00:34:36.150
responding to the
exhibition through text,

00:34:36.150 --> 00:34:38.946
through spoken
word, and through--

00:34:38.946 --> 00:34:43.469
well, we have wind instruments
and string instruments

00:34:43.469 --> 00:34:45.159
and through classical and jazz.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:51.330
So I hope to create a sound
environment and also a text

00:34:51.330 --> 00:34:55.710
based environment that has some
movement and some color that

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:57.840
resonates with the installation.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:05.250
But that also leaves an imprint
of one way to use the space.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:06.250
- There's so much there.

00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:10.420
It's once again this complex
layering in the after lives

00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:12.940
that you imagined
for the characters,

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.720
that you kind of
will into being.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.870
And the way different components
of your artistic practice

00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:23.950
really mutually
inform one another.

00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:27.580
In conclusion, I
think we'd just like

00:35:27.580 --> 00:35:31.390
to point out that Xaviera
is a remarkable wordsmith

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:32.600
in her use of language.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.230
And we heard about
the soaring hawk.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:38.530
But another way that
she describes her method

00:35:38.530 --> 00:35:40.510
is the hungry worm,
the hungry worm

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:42.057
that burrows through archives.

00:35:42.057 --> 00:35:44.140
That's not an image that
librarians and archivists

00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.450
like you hear too often.

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:47.740
But it's remarkably effective.

00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.570
And she's effectively
burned a hole

00:35:49.570 --> 00:35:54.400
through many interesting kind of
collections, collections here.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.930
And another word
that will really

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:58.090
whet your appetite
for the gallery itself

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.280
is that of the maximalist--

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.200
that you are a maximalist
in your approach

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.970
to space in the way you've
conceived of the gallery.

00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:09.485
And it's kind of the
environment itself.

00:36:09.485 --> 00:36:11.860
And I think that's something
that people will immediately

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:15.820
grasp when they enter
into the gallery itself.

00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:20.170
And so with that, I'd
like to invite everybody

00:36:20.170 --> 00:36:23.110
to join us in the
reception at Byerly Hall

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:26.860
to witness the Xaviera's
exhibition and the reception.

00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.250
Before we go, I'd like
to thank again once again

00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:33.700
Xaviera Simmons and Deena
Deitsch for this conversation

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.140
and Xaviera for the exhibition.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.170
Thank you so much.
