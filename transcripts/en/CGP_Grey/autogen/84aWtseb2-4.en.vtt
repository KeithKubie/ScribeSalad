00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.970
 Each year, some countries offer their hours in spring, just to return them 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.689
 Back in the fall. For most of the world they do not 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.759
 Involved in this strange manipulation of clocks - this manipulation seems strange. If so 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.480
 Is the reason behind it? The main idea, proposed by George Hudson, 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.430
 They were giving people more sunlight during the summer. Sure, it is important to note that change 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.980
 The clock does not make more sunlight - that's how physics works. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.890
 But with hours offered for one hour, and for all other humanitarian activities, 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.720
 The sun will look like it is shining and late. The time in which clocks are made 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.739
 Called daylight saving time, the rest of the year is called normal time. 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.190
 This change gives people more time to enjoy the sunshine and fun atmosphere 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.469
 Summer after working time. Hudson specifically wanted more sunlight to spend 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.699
 Time to increase his collection of insects. When winter approaches, the hours are back 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.239
 Assuming that people would not want to spend much time abroad. 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.899
 But winter does not affect all people in this way. 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.219
 If you live in the Kahuai tropical region, you do not need to worry about the seasons of the year 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.280
 Because, overall, they do not occur. Every day, throughout the year, is a beautiful day shining 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.879
 For example, Christmas Day would be a nice day to go to the beach like any other day. Therefore, Hawaiian is Yp] n 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:06.690
 Two states ignore daylight saving time. 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.470
 But the more you move away from the squalor of equanimity, the greater the impact of the seasons 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.670
 The winter will be colder and darker, and summer time will be of great value to the population 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.490
 That region. So it is not surprising that the more the state is removed from the equator 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.670
 The more they are used for daylight saving time. Hudson proposed his idea at Wellington in 1895 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.750
 But it did not meet with approval, and was surprised until 1916 when Germany became the first country 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.230
 It works in daylight saving time. Although the Germans were the industry 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:33.470
 Less enthusiastic about catching butterflies on a lovely summer evening than their enthusiasm 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.190
 To provide coal for their military equipment. The Germans thought it was daylight saving time 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.960
 It will save energy. The explanation is that this will encourage people to stay abroad longer during 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.160
 During the summer, thereby reducing the use of industrial lighting. It seems logical and successful 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.090
 Then in the organized society of the last century, but is there any benefit in modern times? 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.530
 Surprisingly, this is a difficult question 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.180
 answer to. For example, one hopes for the greatest human inventions: 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.340
 air conditioner. The magic box that has made unmanned places of our world 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.320
 Areas where they are likely to live. But heat removal from your home is not 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.160
 A single conditioner is equivalent to the operation of twelve light bulbs (tungsten). 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.590
 If people got more sunlight, they did not take advantage of it 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.670
 To spend time, daylight saving time will save rather than provide electricity. 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.280
 Especially in the area of ​​(Phoenix) 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.540
 Where the mean temperature is 107 and the highest score is 122, during the summer. 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.350
 If you suggested that a resident of Arizona offer their hours to get more sun brightness, 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.160
 I will be ashamed of you. More sun and an increase in electricity bills is another thing he wants! 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.880
 That explains why Arizona is the second state that does not change its hours. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.200
 Another problem when trying to study daylight saving time is rapid changes in technology 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.190
 and electrical use. And as technology gets better and better and 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.190
 better more electricity is dedicated to things that are not light bulbs. 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.800
 And the lure of a hot, sweaty, mosquito-filled day outside is less appealing than technological 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.900
 entertainments and climate-controlled comfort inside. 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.510
 Also the horrifically energy-efficient tungsten light bulbs that have remained unchanged 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.790
 for a century are giving way to CFLs and LEDs - greatly reducing the amount of energy 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.200
 required to light a room. So, even assuming that DST is effective, it's 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.480
 probably less effective with every with every passing year. 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.400
 The bottom line is while some studies say DST costs more electricity and others say 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.790
 it saves electricity, the one thing they agree on is the effect size: not 20% or 10% but 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.250
 1% or less, which, in the United States, works out to be about $ 4 per household. 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.370
 $ 4 saved or spent on electricity over an entire year is not really a huge deal either way. 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.830
 So the question now becomes the hassle of switching the clocks twice a year worth 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.100
 it? The most obvious trouble comes from sleep 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.770
 depravation - an already common problem in the western world that DST makes measurably 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.010
 worse. With time-tracking software we can actually 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.790
 see that people are less productive the week after the clock changes. This comes with huge 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.220
 associated costs. To make things worse, most countries take 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.970
 away that hour of sleep on a Monday morning. Sleep depravation can lead to heart attacks 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.690
 and suicides and the Daylight Saving Time Monday has a higher than normal spike in both. 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.000
 Other troubles come from scheduling meetings across time zones. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.489
 Let's say that your trying to plan a three-way conference between New York, London and Sydney 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.950
 - not an easy thing to do under the best of circumstances but made extra difficult 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.170
 when they do not agree on when daylight saving time should start and end. 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.130
 In the spring, Sydney is 11 hours ahead of London and New York is five hours behind. 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.580
 But then New York is the first to enter Daylight Saving Time and moves its clock forward an 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.380
 hour. Two weeks later London does the same. In one more week, Sydney, being on the opposite 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.269
 side of the world, leaves daylight saving time and moves its clock back an hour. 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:22.790
 So in the space of three weeks New York is five hours behind London, then four hours 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.530
 and then five hours again. And Sydney is either 11, 10 or 9 nine hours from London and 16, 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.190
 15 or 14 hours from New York. And this whole crazy thing happens again in 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.280
 reverse six months later. Back in the dark ages, this might not have 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.360
 mattered so much but in the modern, interconnected world planning international meetings happens 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.950
 1,000s and 1,000s of times daily - shifting and inconsistent time zones is not doing 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.350
 netizens any favors. And, to make matters worse, countries are not 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.100
 even consistent about daylight saving time within their own borders. 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:51.030
 Brazil has daylight saving time, but only if you live in the south. Canada has it too, 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.970
 but not Saskatchewan. Most of Oz does DST, but not Western Australia, The Northern Territory 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.960
 Egypt Queensland. And, of course, the United States does have 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.090
 DST, unless you live in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.750
 Marianas Islands or, as mentioned before Hawaii and Arizona. 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.690
 But Arizona is not even consistent within itself. 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:13.530
 While Arizona ignores DST, the Navaho Nation inside of Arizona follows it. 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.900
 Inside of the Navaho Nation is the Hopi Reservation which, like Arizona, ignores daylight saving 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.870
 time. Going deer, inside of the Hopi Reservation 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.980
 is another part of the Navaho Nation which does follow daylight saving time. 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.980
 And finally there is also part of the Hopi Reservation elsewhere in the Navaho Nation 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.139
 which does not. So driving across this hundred-mile stretch 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:36.330
 would technically necessitate seven clock changes which is insane. 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.949
 While this is an unusual local oddity here is a map showing the different daylight saving 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:43.919
 and time zone rules in all their complicated glory - it's a huge mess and constantly 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:47.540
 needs updating as countries change their laws. Which is why it should not be surprising 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.680
 that even our digital gadgets can not keep the time straight occasionally. 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.240
 So to review: daylight saving time gives more sunlight in the summer after work, which, 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.199
 depending on where you live might be an advantage - or not. 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.120
 And it may (or may not) save electricity but one thing is for sure, it's guaranteed to 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.840
 make something that should be simple, keeping track of time, quite complicated - which 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.680
 is why when it comes time to change the clocks is always a debate about whether or not we 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.930
 should.ch
