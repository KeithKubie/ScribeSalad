00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:05.839
(upbeat music)

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:06.873
- Class, class.

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:07.873
(clapping)

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:08.708
- Yes.

00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.379
- Today we have a new student

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.348 align:start size:84% position:16%
from the Earth
science department.

00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:17.516
Say hi to Lonnie Turpin

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:18.351
- Hi Lonnie.

00:00:18.351 --> 00:00:19.185
- Hello.

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:21.521
What's happening?

00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.290
- Hey Lonnie you're cool.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.692
Do you wanna do a thousand
page puzzle with me sometime?

00:00:26.692 --> 00:00:30.864
- No, I'm just anxious to
learn and try new things.

00:00:31.798 --> 00:00:34.467
(ominous music)

00:00:36.236 --> 00:00:37.770
Who is it this time?

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.239
- Well let's just say some
students and their professor

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.875
are bad eggs and they
need to be removed

00:00:42.875 --> 00:00:45.111
from this fine institution.

00:00:46.745 --> 00:00:48.114
- Uh what do you mean
like try new things?

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.282
Like glamping?

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:53.086
- Uh yeah, something like that.

00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.957
- I'm Professor Rich,
expert in science.

00:00:58.957 --> 00:01:01.160
These are my devoted students.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.596
Together with the aid
of harmless drugs,

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:08.101 align:start size:97% position:3%
we explore science's greatest
hypothetical questions.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:10.670
(upbeat music)

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:22.181
Cat's

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:23.649
- Oh.

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:25.951
- Also known as felis catus.

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:28.621
Average life span, 15 years.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:31.291
One of the top 200 animals.

00:01:31.291 --> 00:01:32.791
- I like dogs.

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.294
- Nope, dogs suck.

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.461
- Yeah cat's.

00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:37.030
- No I'm afraid it's dogs.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.532
(all yelling)

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:43.869
- We need something
to take the edge off.

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.871
- You mean like a smoothie?

00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:46.772
- Mm.

00:01:46.772 --> 00:01:47.973
- Okay cool your jets.

00:01:47.973 --> 00:01:51.010
What if cats became extinct?

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.714
- I would be very sad
because I love cats.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:55.949
- Yeah cats are the best.

00:01:55.949 --> 00:01:57.484 align:start size:84% position:16%
- If you say something
like that again.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:59.152
(all yelling)

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:01.988
- Please let's not
have a relapse okay?

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:02.822
- Relapse.

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:08.393
- I'd like to run around
in circles for a minute.

00:02:08.393 --> 00:02:11.064
- Okay but don't make any noise.

00:02:12.165 --> 00:02:13.233
- Psst Jenny.

00:02:14.534 --> 00:02:17.336
What illegal drug do
you think he's on?

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:20.840
- Oh no no, he's just
a super big weirdo.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.741
- [Running Student]
I can hear you guys.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:25.578
- I decided to meet an
expert on dinosaurs.

00:02:25.578 --> 00:02:27.313 align:start size:84% position:16%
Who would know better
about extinction

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.215
than a dinosaur expert?

00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:34.220 align:start size:97% position:3%
I'm going to be taking my
glasses on and off throughout

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.889 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
the interview, I just thought
I would warn you of that.

00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.824
- I appreciate the heads up.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:43.062
- Now your specialty, do
you deal with extinction?

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.764 align:start size:97% position:3%
- We deal a lot with
extinction and paleontology.

00:02:45.764 --> 00:02:48.067 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Now what is an
animal that might be

00:02:48.067 --> 00:02:51.437
in danger of being
extinct right now?

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:54.841 align:start size:97% position:3% line:0%
- The Iberian lynx is a
good one in the cat family.

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:56.075
- Opossum.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:57.609 line:0%
- Opossum not so much.

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.578 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay I just thought
maybe opossum.

00:02:59.578 --> 00:03:03.415
What if cats became
extinct, all of them?

00:03:03.415 --> 00:03:06.185
- It would be a very
interesting phenomena.

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.620
It would result in
a loss of a very

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.389
charismatic group of mammals.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.593
- How would a cat
become extinct?

00:03:13.593 --> 00:03:16.963
What would be the scenario for
this sort of thing happening?

00:03:16.963 --> 00:03:19.565 align:start size:94% position:6%
- So a lot of this is kind
of speculation in terms

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.901
of what would cause
a species extinction.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:24.403 align:start size:84% position:16%
- A lot of what I
deal is speculation.

00:03:24.403 --> 00:03:26.205 align:start size:84% position:16%
- That doesn't
surprise me either.

00:03:26.205 --> 00:03:27.440
- Yes.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.908
- But a lot of the time
when we're dealing with

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:33.212 align:start size:97% position:3%
domesticated organisms whether
they be crops or animals,

00:03:33.212 --> 00:03:36.315 align:start size:94% position:6%
you can see reduced levels
of genetic diversity

00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:39.251
and that sometimes makes them
more susceptible to disease.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:41.287
- I see, you're a dog person.

00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.122
This interview's done.

00:03:45.825 --> 00:03:49.962 align:start position:0%
- I smoked a marijuana cigarette
with one Leonard Kravitz.

00:03:49.962 --> 00:03:51.397
- Wow.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.598
- Whoa.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:55.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I don't say this very
often but you rock.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.939 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Anyway, let's conduct
an experiment okay?

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:03.442 align:start size:84% position:16%
Now this is an
ecosystem with cats

00:04:03.442 --> 00:04:05.978
as an integral part, okay?

00:04:05.978 --> 00:04:09.148 align:start size:81% position:19%
This is when we
take out the cats.

00:04:09.148 --> 00:04:10.783
See how it's changed?

00:04:10.783 --> 00:04:12.185
- [Student] Whoa
cheese consumption

00:04:12.185 --> 00:04:13.753
is almost down to nothing.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:17.656
- What the fuck is gonna
happen to cheeseburgers?

00:04:17.656 --> 00:04:19.959
- Oh speaking of cheeseburgers,

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.195 align:start size:84% position:16%
I've got a wicked
case of the munchies.

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:25.331
(all agreeing)

00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.799
- Does anyone have any food?

00:04:26.799 --> 00:04:30.136 align:start size:84% position:16%
- No I guess we'll
just have to light up.

00:04:30.136 --> 00:04:31.637
Who's holding.

00:04:31.637 --> 00:04:33.973
- Oh I've got a huge stash
right here, let me find it.

00:04:33.973 --> 00:04:35.775
- As an agent of Eastern
Montana State University.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:36.609
- Here we go.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:38.310
- [Rich] Oh boy.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.445
- Nice.

00:04:39.445 --> 00:04:40.313
- I love these.

00:04:40.313 --> 00:04:41.547
Mm.

00:04:41.547 --> 00:04:42.815
- They're balls of cheese.

00:04:42.815 --> 00:04:43.816
- Mm perfect.

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:45.318
- They're so yummy.

00:04:45.318 --> 00:04:47.887 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So Lonnie what were you
saying about being an agent?

00:04:47.887 --> 00:04:49.889
- Uh nothing, I'm Asian.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.960
100% Japanese actually, so.

00:04:56.495 --> 00:04:58.831 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I needed to go
straight to the source.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:00.867
That's right, a cat lady.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.904
What if, okay, this
is a cat, right.

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:06.472 line:0%
- Yes that is a cat.

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:10.343
- What if the possibility
that cats became extinct.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.312 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
Would you be doing
something else?

00:05:13.312 --> 00:05:14.480
- Yes.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.714 align:start size:84% position:16%
- What other animals
would you be?

00:05:15.714 --> 00:05:17.183
- I think I would
be helping horses.

00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.684
- Opossum.

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:20.353 line:0%
- I would help an opossum,
I've helped many of them.

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:24.189
- For society in general how
we would react I would say

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:26.426
it might be a cat astrophe.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Well cat's have
been domesticated
since the Egyptians.

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.532
So about 4,000 years.

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:37.002
- So cats definitely serve
a purpose in our society.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.004 align:start size:88% position:13%
- They do, they actually
do serve a purpose.

00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:41.574 align:start size:97% position:3%
They lower our blood pressure
and there are studies

00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.375 align:start size:84% position:16%
that have shown
children who grow up.

00:05:43.375 --> 00:05:45.378
- Meow, oh, I'm a mommy.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:50.015
- You're a good mommy.

00:05:50.015 --> 00:05:51.517
Just don't let go.

00:05:53.185 --> 00:05:55.921
- And the irony is,
I'm allergic to cats.

00:05:55.921 --> 00:05:58.224
(laughing)

00:06:00.859 --> 00:06:03.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah but do you
take anything for it?

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:06.765
Uppers, downers, middlers, meth?

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.034
- Well an antihistamine.

00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:10.436
- Who else takes some?

00:06:10.436 --> 00:06:14.072 align:start size:94% position:6%
But state your name
first, clearly and loudly?

00:06:14.072 --> 00:06:15.074
- Jenny Harrison.

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:15.908
J E N N.

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:18.043
(whistle blowing)

00:06:18.043 --> 00:06:22.382
- Ah ha alright ne'er
do wells the jig is up.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.084
I'm finally shutting down
this low class, class.

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.285
- But why?

00:06:26.285 --> 00:06:28.153
- Drug use and I
got it all on tape.

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:30.790
- Whoa new guy's a narc.

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.658
- Lonnie's a narcoleptic?

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:34.927 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You can't fire
me, I've got tenure.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:37.663
- Tenure 12 miles away.

00:06:37.663 --> 00:06:38.898
- [Jenny] What?

00:06:38.898 --> 00:06:39.898
- What the fuck?

00:06:39.898 --> 00:06:40.767
- [Jenny] What does that mean?

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:43.269
(all talking)

00:06:46.104 --> 00:06:47.506
- If you wanted to
construct a joke.

00:06:47.506 --> 00:06:48.341
- Shut up!

00:06:49.941 --> 00:06:52.778
Consider this class terminated.

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:55.648 align:start size:88% position:13%
Terminated,
terminated, terminated.

00:06:57.850 --> 00:06:59.085
(gasping)

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:01.621
(upbeat music)

00:07:10.695 --> 00:07:13.199
- Sometimes I think I'm a cat.

00:07:14.266 --> 00:07:15.101
Rawr.
