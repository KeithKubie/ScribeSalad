00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:09.108
Alright, kids, today we're going
to read the biography

00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:10.910
of Nick Saban.

00:00:10.943 --> 00:00:13.746
Oo, it starts of with a quote
from Nick Saban, himself.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.281
"Football is not Hamlet.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:17.984
It's not tragedy.
It should be fun."

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.719
Tell it to your face.

00:00:20.252 --> 00:00:24.657
Saban, who was then the head
coach of the Dolphins

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.460
had publicly denied any interest
in the Alabama job

00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:31.297
over and over and over.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.766
Well, guess I can
close the book.

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.902
There's no way
he's going to Alabama.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:38.404
A man is only as good
as his word.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:40.273
Keep reading!

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.608
Saban knew how it would look
if he left the Dolphins

00:00:42.641 --> 00:00:44.077
after just two seasons.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.249
He would be called a liar,
a failure and a quitter.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.951
Say it with me, kids:

00:00:51.984 --> 00:00:54.821
(all together)
A liar, a failure and a quitter.

00:00:54.854 --> 00:00:57.023
But the decision
wasn't his alone.

00:00:57.556 --> 00:01:01.094
Yes, it was. Nobody gives a
(bleep) what your wife thinks.

00:01:01.127 --> 00:01:03.463
Wayne Huizenga was paying you
millions of dollars.

00:01:03.496 --> 00:01:05.398
You don't even give a (bleep)
about your wife.

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:08.034
You know why she wanted out?
She felt ugly in Miami.

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:11.637
If you want to feel smart,
sexy and special,

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.039
you surround yourself

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.175
with thousands of
toothless townies in Tuscaloosa.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.244
She also believed that
a college town

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:21.647
was a much healthier place
to raise their two children.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.049
Didn't his daughter, Kristen,

00:01:23.082 --> 00:01:25.318
almost murder someone
with her bare hands?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:26.752
Yes. Yes, she did.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:31.124
Saban says, "In the NFL,
you were penalized for success."

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:32.391
What success?

00:01:32.424 --> 00:01:33.593
Exactly!

00:01:35.194 --> 00:01:37.196
The only thing that's smaller
than his Hitler 'stache

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.932
is Nick Saban's dick.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.735
That overinflated football fan
is Stingray

00:01:42.768 --> 00:01:46.306
and he eats, sleeps, eats
and breathes Mississippi State.

00:01:47.473 --> 00:01:49.108
Stingray got internet famous
for hooting

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.577
and hollering about
one of the worst teams

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.812
in one of
the most top-heavy,

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:56.115
overrated conferences
of all-time, the SEC.

00:01:56.148 --> 00:01:59.018
The Southeastern Conference,
or KKK for short.

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:02.989
It's like the NFL
for garbage states too poor

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.857
to support a pro team.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.760
If you're not sure which teams
are part of the SEC,

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.263
google most uneducated states,

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:13.399
or states with the highest rate
of uninsured adults,

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.768
or hardest places
to get an abortion.

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.372
The only thing the SEC hates
more than gay marriage

00:02:19.405 --> 00:02:21.474
is the forward pass.

00:02:21.507 --> 00:02:22.775
If it weren't for
college football,

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:25.778
SEC fans would never know
college existed.

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.813
Someone needs to tell
these simpletons

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:31.417
they've got three sets
of tigers, two sets of bulldogs,

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.053
and one team named
after a woman's period.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.521
Alright, Stingray,

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:37.590
I got one more surprise
for you before the big game.

00:02:37.623 --> 00:02:39.792
The Bulldogs are going to let me
return a kickoff?

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:43.129
No! I got rid of the South's
most hateful statue.

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.630
You tore down Robert E. Lee?

00:02:44.663 --> 00:02:46.098
Hell no!

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:48.635
I tore down Nick Saban's statue
over in Tuscaloosa.

00:02:52.271 --> 00:02:54.974
No five-foot tall man
deserves a statue.

00:02:55.007 --> 00:02:56.442
What'd you do with it?

00:02:56.475 --> 00:02:59.245
I melted it down, sculpted it
into a real Southern hero.

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.451
There she is, Stingray,
in all her majesty.

00:03:05.484 --> 00:03:07.187
You were born to be bronzed.

00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:12.925
It's no secret that I think
Nick Saban is a horrible human,

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:14.594
and it doesn't help
that he just hired

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.163
that whiny, arrogant,
beautiful Lane Kiffin.

00:03:17.796 --> 00:03:20.466
So, imagine my delight
when I found out Lane

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:22.902
and his lovely wife
have a public access show.

00:03:27.172 --> 00:03:28.574
Welcome back.
You're on triple K.

00:03:28.607 --> 00:03:29.976
What's your question?

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:31.811
Hey, Lane, just wondering
if it's natural talent

00:03:31.844 --> 00:03:34.113
or if you guys practice fumbling
all the (bleep) time,

00:03:34.146 --> 00:03:35.615
you stupid piece of (bleep).

00:03:35.648 --> 00:03:38.351
Alright, I'm going to go jizz
inside your tramp of a wi-

00:03:42.354 --> 00:03:44.657
Alright, no pain, no Lane.
Next caller.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.325
I love what you've done
to open up the offense,

00:03:46.358 --> 00:03:49.095
to give the Tide and identity
as a passing team.

00:03:49.128 --> 00:03:50.763
I was wondering what
Nick Saban's oatmeal cream

00:03:50.796 --> 00:03:52.865
pies taste like when
he (bleep) them in your mouth,

00:03:52.898 --> 00:03:55.501
you (bleep) coward!
War Eagle, you pussy! You look-

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:01.073
Maybe we start screening
some of these calls.

00:04:01.106 --> 00:04:02.875
I'd like to apologize
to our viewers.

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:04.443
Second down. Let's try again.

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:07.747
Long time caller, first time
listener, big USC fan.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.916
I hope you die of AIDS,
you overpaid pussy.

00:04:11.784 --> 00:04:14.254
We have got to get
a longer cord next season.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:16.656
Who am I kidding? We're not
going to be here next year.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:17.890
Next caller.

00:04:17.923 --> 00:04:19.659
What was it like being
the last regret

00:04:19.692 --> 00:04:21.761
in Al Davis' 50-year career
full of (bleep)-ups?

00:04:21.794 --> 00:04:23.262
I'll take your answer
off the air, you

00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:24.730
(bleep)-licking (bleep) for
brains.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.433
Two-part question.
Now that you're down

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:28.901
South,
you going to divorce your wife

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:30.770
so you can start
(bleep) farm animals?

00:04:30.803 --> 00:04:32.271
If you do divorce your wife,

00:04:32.304 --> 00:04:34.240
you think she'll be able
to handle my big fat (bleep)

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:36.376
after all those years
of your pencil dick?

00:04:37.142 --> 00:04:39.378
When are you going to be
head coach again, sweetie?

00:04:39.411 --> 00:04:41.113
Not now, my love.

00:04:41.146 --> 00:04:42.415
Next caller.

00:04:42.448 --> 00:04:44.317
Oh, nice trophy case,
you un-winning (bleep).

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:46.319
Look how goddamn empty
that thing is.

00:04:46.352 --> 00:04:48.120
Where you going to fail
upwards next?

00:04:48.153 --> 00:04:49.955
I got a question about
the no-huddle offense.

00:04:49.988 --> 00:04:52.024
Okay, this one I should
be able to handle.

00:04:52.057 --> 00:04:53.859
Why do you think you prefer
the hurry up, but every time

00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:55.394
I (bleep) your smoking hot wife
in the ass,

00:04:55.427 --> 00:04:56.629
she begs me to slow down?

00:04:56.662 --> 00:04:58.364
I'm pretty sure
that was Urban Meyer.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:04:59.732
Next caller.

00:04:59.765 --> 00:05:01.200
Are you going to be
the next coordinator

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.402
to start molesting children?

00:05:03.435 --> 00:05:05.071
Just kidding, I know you are,
you (bleep)

00:05:05.104 --> 00:05:06.872
(bleep)-face
pedophile.

00:05:06.905 --> 00:05:08.841
People really don't like you.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.209
Next caller.

00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.144
Bama fans are
all sister-(bleep) retards

00:05:12.177 --> 00:05:13.512
Goddammit!

00:05:13.545 --> 00:05:14.714
Hope you all die in a-

00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:16.182
Next caller.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:20.052
Keep it clean, and don't say
a word about my wife.

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:21.320
Nice tits, bitch.

00:05:21.353 --> 00:05:22.722
Nice pleated Dockers, you prick.

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:23.956
Shut up!

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:25.224
Oh, yeah, look at you.
Hit the button.

00:05:25.257 --> 00:05:26.058
-Shut...
-Oh, yeah.

00:05:26.091 --> 00:05:27.293
...your face.
Shut...

00:05:27.326 --> 00:05:28.561
Oh, yeah, that's going to work,
idiot.

00:05:28.594 --> 00:05:30.129
(mocking)
I don't know how to work phones.

00:05:30.162 --> 00:05:31.030
Shut up.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:32.765
(mocking)
I'm Lane Kiffin.

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:37.370
Hey, do you wear that visor
when you (bleep) your dad?

00:05:38.904 --> 00:05:40.473
...have a long feud
with Nick Saban.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:43.743
Now as an Auburn alum,
do you have a message for him?

00:05:43.776 --> 00:05:45.010
War Eagle.

00:05:45.043 --> 00:05:46.612
War Eagle, is that fun to yell?

00:05:46.645 --> 00:05:47.913
It is.

00:05:47.946 --> 00:05:50.516
Were you at Auburn when
those inbred (bleep)

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:51.884
over at Alabama
poisoned your tree?

00:05:51.917 --> 00:05:53.119
I was.

00:05:53.152 --> 00:05:54.320
How did that make you feel?

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.389
I mean 'Bama sucks.
'Bamers are 'Bamers.

00:05:56.422 --> 00:05:58.657
Was that worse than a school
shooting do you think?

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.025
The tree?
No?

00:06:00.058 --> 00:06:01.160
Ew.

00:06:01.193 --> 00:06:02.862
I think you answered it.
