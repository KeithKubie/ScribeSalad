&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.940
[ Silence ]

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.780
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Welcome everybody,
I'm Josephine Reed, I produce

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.150
and host the weekly podcast
for the National Endowment

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.080
to the Arts, called Art Works.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.600 position:56%
Which you can check out at arts.gov,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.480 position:56%
where you can also find our fabulous
blog and short documentaries

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.250
about arts throughout the country.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.380
So there's the shameless
plug for the NEA.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.780 position:56%
I want to, thank you, welcome to a
conversation about legacy and novels

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.360 position:56%
with Julia Glass and Jennifer Haigh.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.060
This is going to be the shortest
intro ever so, Julia Glass.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.080
Her most recent book is
a House Among the Trees.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.620
The story of a relationship

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.760
between a celebrated recently
deceased children's writer

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.160
and his assistant.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.500
Which is further complicated
by his wishes

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.920
for the disposal of his estate.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.190
Julia is the author
of five previous books

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.650
of fiction including Three
Junes, her debut novel

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.760
which won the National
book Award in 2002.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.400
Julia has received a number
of fellowships including one

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.440
from the National endowment for
the Arts in creative writing.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.600
Jennifer Haigh's most recent novel,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.260
Heat and Glass has just
come out in paperback.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.560
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Heat and Light.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.750
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: And she returns to
the Pennsylvania town of Bakerton,

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.680
where the issue of fracking
is upending the community

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.860
and folks there are
slowly discovering

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.420
that what they were promised is
not necessarily what they're going

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.810
to get.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.800
Jennifer is the author of the short
story collection, News From Heaven

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.280
and four novels including
Baker's Towers and Mrs. Kimble,

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.630
which won the PEN/Hemmingway
Award for debut fiction.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.050
And Jennifer is also a
recipient of a fellowship

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.650
in creative writing from the NEA.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.880
Okay so we know who
we are so let's begin.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.910
First of all when I'm
thinking about legacy and Julia

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.140
in your books there's the
personal legacy in the possessions

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.850
of Mort Lear, your author
and then the literary legacy

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.370
that he leaves behind is impact
on generations of children.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.450
And Jennifer with your book it's
the legacy basically of geography,

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.710
what the earth leaves
us and how we use it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.450
and then how previous macro
decisions about energy.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.730
Factors into what we're
looking at today.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.790
So I actually think it's a
really fruitful conversation

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.240
on both the micro and
the macro level.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.440
Julia I'd like to start with
you simply at the beginning

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:53.390
about what draws you to a
particular idea for a novel?

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.050
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: So my novels
don't start with ideas,

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.830
they start with characters and
there are many different ways

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.380
that different authors approach
the material they're working with.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.670
But for me this novel
started because I happened

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.860
to read an article in the New York
times that was published short

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.950
after the children's book
author, Maurice Sendak died.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.320
And it focused on how the
will he left behind was not

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.450
at all the will which was expected.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.090
In fact, he completely scorned
this museum in Philadelphia

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.620
which had reason to believe
they were going to inherit all

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.530
of his art work and
he left them none.

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.430
Now but the part of the article
that interested me the most was

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:41.300
that the executor who was to carry
out all these wishes was a woman

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.050
who had lived in his house with
him for many years starting

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.760
out as his dog walker, becoming
probably his professional assistant

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.390
and then became I think
in his older years,

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.640
probably a domesticate help maid.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.890
And there was a lot of criticism

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.340
from the literary world,
that who was this woman.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.590
She couldn't possibly be
qualified to undertake, you know,

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.380
to shoulder the legacy
of this great man.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.810
And I just thought about her and I
thought what would it be like first

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.080
of all to live your life in service
to a genius, to a great artist.

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:20.340
What's it like to be in that
orbit or centrifugal force

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.920
and then what would it
be like to be left not

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.700
with just the material legacy but
with the reputation especially

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.180
if secrets emerged as they
often do after someone dies.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.810
What do you do with the
things you find out,

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.710 position:56%
does the world deserve to know them.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.200
And as you know the plot is
also complicated by the fact

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.720
that the artist in my
book, who is inspired by

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.020
but not based on Maurice Sendak.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.270
His name is Mort Lear, there was a
movie in development to do a biopic

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.310 position:56%
about his life and the after cast to
play him had been in correspondence

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.740
with him and was expecting
to meet him

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.430
and the novel begins the
day that actor arrives.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:04.480
When instead he has
died quite suddenly,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.680
ten days before the
assistant and the actor meet.

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.980
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: And I'm
glad you brought that up

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.610
because one thing I
really did want to ask you,

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:18.040
you had Tommy the assistant and
Meredith the jilted museum curator.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.720
And I think most authors at point
would say that's pretty you know,

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.030
plenty of conflict, let's just
call it a day and focus on them.

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.000
But you bought in that third leg.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.620
You brought in Nick Green who
added just a lot of richness

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800
and complications to the book.

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:40.440
What made you go in that direction
and bring that character in?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.810
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: That's a bit of
a long story but I should say

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:49.510
that I have a 21year old son who
is passionately involved in acting.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.020
All he wants to be is an actor
which they say is the only way

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.680
to approach being an actor, it
better be the only thing you want.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.430
And you can imagine I'm a
little frightened about that

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.140
because all my friends say I'm not
in a position to discourage a child

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:05.100
from following their creative
urges, so good luck to me.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:08.380
But it really grew, Nick
Green's character really grew

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.610
out of conversations and
arguments with my son about actors

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.790
and their portrayals and
what does being an actor

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.680
and how you portray a real, whether
that person is living or dead.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.390
And as any of you who go
to the movies know a lot

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.190
of films these days are biopics.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.640
Whether they're about Alan
Turing or Stephen Hawking

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.590
or painter Turner or Steve Jobs.

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.640
I mean that is a very big part
of our film story telling now.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.720
And in a way the actor also
holds the legacy of that person

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.920
in their hands when they
approach the performance.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.140
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Jennifer in
the case of Heat and Light,

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:54.730
this is the third time that
you've returned to Bakerton,

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:01.660
can you tell me how your geographic
roots really inform your work?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: My three Bakerton
books are very much about a place,

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.840
they're stories that could
not have happened anywhere

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.960
but in this little coal town
in western Pennsylvania.

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.880
I call the town Bakerton, it's
very much modeled after the town

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:22.000
where I grew up in Cambria County,
Pennsylvania called Barnesboro.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.540
And this location, this town

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.860
of Bakerton has really become a
character of mine and it's one

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:31.670
that I return to again and again.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.500
The first Bakerton book
was called Baker Towers

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.970
and it was my second novel.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:42.950
It was set in the 1940s and 50s
when the coal mines were booming

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:45.600
and the town was vibrant.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.230
That to me was a story I always
wanted to tell because you know,

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.070
by the time I was growing up
in the 70s and 80s it was all

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.170
over for coal mining in
my part of Pennsylvania.

00:07:56.170 --> 00:08:00.260
And all these stories that I had
heard about the glorious past

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:02.830
of this town were just stories.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:07.750
So I think that novel grew out
of my desire to time travel back

00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.440
to those years to see
what it was really like.

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.330
You know, there's a character in
Heat and Light who is thinking

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.700
about his town and he said
the town is all aftermath.

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.660
And that is very much my
experience growing up in that town,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.540
it had already seen better days.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.010
So I wrote a book about
those better days.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.580
Baker Towers published in 2005

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.510
and for a long time I
thought okay, I did it.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.150 position:56%
I said everything I had to say about
this town, I time travelled back

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:42.780
to the glory days, okay done, I
can go write about something else.

00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:47.740
And I did, I wrote two more novels
set in Boston where I live now

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:50.590
and I thought I was
done with Bakerton.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:53.690
But you know, in those years
a funny thing happened.

00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:58.660
I found myself thinking about some
of the characters in Baker Towers

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:01.970
and wondering how their
lives turned out.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:03.900
I mean that for me is
what novels are about,

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:09.920
how people's lives turnout and
so I gave myself permission

00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.720
to write a short story,
one short story.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.000
About Joyce Novak who is the
main character in Baker Towers.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.010
And that story led me
to write another story

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.680
about her brother Sandy who is sort

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.660
of a mysterious figure
in Baker Towers.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.020
And I wanted to write a story to
let readers know what he was really

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.790
up to, what were secrets.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.160
And so each of these
Bakerton stories led me

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.550
to write another Bakerton story
and pretty soon I had a collection

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:42.200
of ten of them all set
in or around this town.

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.420
Those stories I call
News From Heaven,

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:48.580
really deal with what
the aftermath was.

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.020
What was it like to live in
that town after the mines died,

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.280
after the towns reason
for being had dried up

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:59.050
and blown away, then what happens.

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:02.330
How do people find
a way to continue.

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.380
And so that was very much
the question at the center

00:10:04.380 --> 00:10:06.970
of those stories, News From Heaven.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:10.040
So after that I thought
okay now I'm really done.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.850
Because clearly nothing else is
ever going to happen in this town,

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.590
I'm done, there is no more.

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:21.130
And right around that time
this fracking story started

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:22.430
to be all over the news.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:26.460
And I'm sure many of you
have been following this

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.460
in the early 2000s there
was a lot of conversation

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.670
about natural gas drilling in
Pennsylvania, New York State,

00:10:34.670 --> 00:10:36.940
West Virginia, Eastern Ohio.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.480
This formation called
the Marcellus shale.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.870
Geologists had known for 100
years that it was down there

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:47.910
but until recently we did not have
the technology to extract that gas,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:50.210
there was just no way to get to it.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.030
That changed in the 90s

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:55.960
when Halliburton developed this
technique of hydraulic fracturing.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.940
They at first used it on oil wells

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.010
but then they found this was also a
way you could extract natural gas.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.630
And so for this regions of
Pennsylvania where it seemed

00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:10.000
to be all over there was suddenly
this new possibility that a lot

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.630
of people were very excited about.

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:14.060
That you know, for people who
had been mourning the death

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:17.910
of the coal industry for a
generation it seemed like oh,

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.730
for the first time in 30
years we have good news.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.960 position:56%
There's opportunity for people here.

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.590
There are going to be jobs,
there's going to prosperity again,

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:31.040
so it was really greeted
with a great deal of hope

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.170
by people in western Pennsylvania.

00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:38.040
Of course as you all know
it's not quite that simple,

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:44.750
there's also a case against
fracking, that, you know, is real.

00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:47.790
There are legitimate
environmental questions

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.530
about the safety of fracking.

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.240
So there has been a real
heated argument going

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:58.490
on about the advisability of
fracking in the Marcellus shale.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:03.630
So Heat and Light is a story
about what happens to a town

00:12:03.630 --> 00:12:05.210
when they yes to fracking.

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:07.210
When the gas industry moves in,

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:12.180
when people are leasing the
mineral rights to their land

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:15.400
and how life changes
for everybody involved.

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:19.730
So this is a surprise third
act to my Bakerton story

00:12:19.730 --> 00:12:22.310
that I wasn't expecting
ever to write.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:27.590
It was just a book that life gave
me and that happens sometimes

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:28.890
when you're writing novels.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:30.900
There are books that
life just gives you.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.760
If you're paying attention
to the world around you,

00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.150
sometimes a novel just about
drops down on your head

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:39.470
and that's what Heat and Light was.

00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:43.950
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: I find with
both of your books they seem

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:50.680
to be asking many questions but
among them it's what do we value,

00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:53.400
what do possessions mean?

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.810
What dreams do we have,
what dreams do we let go of?

00:12:56.810 --> 00:13:01.250
What do we do in the
pursuit of those dreams?

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:07.300
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Well, you know
that's and interesting way to look

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.550 position:56%
at it but I actually want talk about
something a little bit different

00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:16.480
and I also want to ask Jennifer
about it and it has to do

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.370
with the choices that
we make in life.

00:13:19.370 --> 00:13:23.610 position:56%
I found myself having a conversation
with my older son the other night

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:25.170
where I said to him, we
were walking about --

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:28.460
he'd seen a movie and the
character obviously had regrets.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.490
And I said you know, honey as
you grow older you will find

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:31.790
that you will have regrets.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:33.360
I said if anybody tells you

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.790
that they have no regrets
they're either very shallow

00:13:36.790 --> 00:13:38.340
or they are lying to you.

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:42.690
And I was thinking about
choice and I always talk

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:46.510
about the choices my characters
make and how they guide the plot.

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.470
I write ahead into the dark
and so one of the things

00:13:50.470 --> 00:13:53.820
in my book is not just what
do the characters value

00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.040
but what why have they
made the choices they made

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.340
that have led them to this moment.

00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:59.520
And which choices do they
look back on as choices

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.220 position:56%
that maybe they shouldn't have made.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:04.450
And one of the things that I
really loved about Heat and Light,

00:14:04.450 --> 00:14:09.340
and by the way as someone who
writes from character and I teach

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:12.240
and I teach my students
that characters are --

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.240
they're the meat of the story.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:20.100
I just was blown away by how many
fully real life characters are

00:14:20.100 --> 00:14:21.610
in Heat and Light.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:24.670
And as I wrote to Jennifer
after I finished it,

00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.110
I loved the first character.

00:14:26.110 --> 00:14:29.670
Even though he is very morally
complicated man because he's trying

00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.620
to get these people to sign
these leases for the fracking.

00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.780
And then I saw that I was
going to another character

00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:36.990
in the next chapter, I thought
wait a sec I really wanted

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.290
to be back with that character.

00:14:38.290 --> 00:14:41.300
Then I was in love with
the second character.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:45.230
But the really important
things it seems to me in Heat

00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:48.680
and Light is the whole issue
of the choices that we make.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.730
And what happens when the choices
that one person makes conflict

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:55.490
with the choices that a
neighbor makes or a spouse makes.

00:14:55.490 --> 00:15:00.370
And there's you know, a lot of
turmoil emerges from the choices

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:03.570
that are suddenly forced
on this community you know,

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.830
by this company that comes in.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.950
The stranger that comes to town.

00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.250
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh:
Yeah, exactly right.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.910
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: I mean did
you plot everything out,

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:15.560
I mean I need to ask [cross-talk] I
was just at Truman Anderson's thing

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.410
and I had actually
never heard this before

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:21.930
but somebody asked him are
you a pancer or a plotter?

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:23.680
Do you know that term pancer?

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.290
Well, he said oh yes
well for those of you

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:28.640 position:56%
who don't know that's a writing term
that means do you plot your book out

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.610
or do you write from
the seat of you pants?

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:32.660
So I just found out I'm a pancer.

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:34.700
So are you a pancer
or are you a plotter?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.800
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: The answer
to that question is yes.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.100
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Both.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:39.400
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: I am
both of those things.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.630
Because here's what happens, when
I'm writing a novel I never think

00:15:42.630 --> 00:15:44.800
about plot, I don't
even use that word.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:50.320
What I think about is causality,
that every time an event happens

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.600
in the story it has to have
a consequence that leads

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.900
to another consequence, that
leads to another consequence.

00:15:56.900 --> 00:16:01.870
So really what I'm doing is I'm
writing kind of a flow chart

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:05.850
of the consequences of
choices people make.

00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:09.560
So to me you know, plot is
something that writers inflict

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.870
on their characters and causality
is something that happens

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.070
on its own in this organic way.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:21.230
That every event has ripples and
those ripples lead to other ripples

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:26.460
and so I may invent the first event
but then what I'm doing is thinking

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.770
of all the penumbra of
possible consequences

00:16:29.770 --> 00:16:31.550
of that event and choosing one.

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.010
And then I do the same
thing over and over again

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:40.520 position:56%
and that's how the story gets built,
so I'm kind of a pancer in the sense

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.120
that I'm just going as
far as the next choice.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.060
And then I just play out
the consequences of that.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.720
So I don't know it's a middle path.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.020
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Right but
the plot in Heat and Light

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:56.430
or the story I should say has many
moving parts, partly because it has

00:16:56.430 --> 00:17:00.820
so many characters making so many
different choices and the writer

00:17:00.820 --> 00:17:05.690
in me as opposed to the reader
in me was just wondering,

00:17:05.690 --> 00:17:07.880
did you know where
you were going to end?

00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.690
Did you know, because it's a story

00:17:11.690 --> 00:17:14.680
with a real moral backbone
but not heavy handed.

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.370
So did you know where it
was going to come out?

00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:22.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: I
did and I was wrong.

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:25.850
That's usually what happens to
me, I usually think I have an idea

00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:28.160
where I want it to go
but I'm always wrong.

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:35.640
So this was a book that was a
very hard thing for me to hold

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.970
in my hands, it was like trying
to hold water in your hands.

00:17:37.970 --> 00:17:40.320
When I started writing it
I thought I writing just

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:45.050
about this fracking controversy
but as I wrote I realized

00:17:45.050 --> 00:17:49.110
that the story was much,
much larger than this.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:52.630
That in this part of the world
and this is a line from the book

00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:55.010
that Pennsylvania is
what lies beneath.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:18:00.070
It is a place whose destiny has
been determined by its geology.

00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:03.380
You know, the first oil well
in the world was drilled

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:05.720
in western Pennsylvania,
most people don't know this.

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:08.580
Then we had 150 years
of coal mining,

00:18:08.580 --> 00:18:10.690
we had deep mines,
we had strip mines.

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:14.300
We had the Three Mile
Island nuclear disaster.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.720
So throughout its history
Pennsylvania has really been living

00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:21.160
the story of energy and
that's what Heat and Light is.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.320
And it's a story that I do
go to Three Mile Island,

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:28.860 position:56%
I do go back to the days of drilling
oil in the 1850's in Pennsylvania.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.290
Because there's simply no way
to understand this story except

00:18:33.290 --> 00:18:35.060
by looking at its context,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.900
this fracking thing
didn't happen in a vacuum.

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:43.380
Pennsylvania has been down this
road before and before and before.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:47.350
And when you think about where we
get our energy in this country,

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:49.500
it's always coming
from the same region,

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:51.130
it's always the same communities

00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:53.610
that are kind of left
holding the bag.

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:56.960
That is West Virginia and Western
Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:00.120
and Eastern Kentucky
where coal mining happens

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.760
and those places profit from having
energy extracted and they also

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.550
at times pay a terrible price.

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:10.780
And so that's what I was interested
in exploring in this book.

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.130
Both the benefits of having
these rich natural resources

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.620
and the hidden costs.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.020
So fracking is just
a piece of it really.

00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.090
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Well, in
the book you taught,

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:24.860
Rich one of your main characters,
mentions that the kind of people

00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:27.530
who take showers before they go
to work and the kind of people

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:30.550
who take showers when
they come home from work.

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.920 position:56%
And one thing I like about your work
is you focus so often on the people

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.500
who take showers after work.

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.450
And that is very rare.

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:40.750
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh:
Oh, it's very rare

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:44.650
and it's something
I care a lot about.

00:19:44.650 --> 00:19:47.720
All of my work in one way
or another is about class,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.510
it is the subject I keep coming
back to again and again and again.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:56.870
I'm struck by how little of our
contemporary fiction actually deals

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:58.930
with working class people.

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:02.580
Almost none of it and
there are reasons for that.

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.800
A lot of it has to do with the sort
of futile system of publishing.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.390
That publishing is such a
difficult field to make a living

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:13.170
in that young people
going into it kind

00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.070 position:56%
of can't do it without a trust fund.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:17.640
You know, you get an entry
level job in publishing

00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:21.090
that pays you $22,000 a year
and you're living in Manhattan

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:26.390
where your rent is you know, $3,000
a month, how do those numbers work?

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:29.560
Well, what happens is kids
from working class backgrounds

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.630
like myself do not go into
publishing and become editors

00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:38.460
and so what you have in American
publishing is this sampling

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:42.630 position:56%
of editors who are by and large from
comfortable backgrounds and tend

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:47.960
to be drawn to stories that evoke
the world that is familiar to them.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:51.660
You know, it's subjective, what an
editor decides to publish has a lot

00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.400
to do with what seems
relevant to her,

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.620
what reflects the world
back to her as she knows it.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:03.080
So often young editors are going to
gravitate toward books about people

00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:06.480
like themselves, it's a
natural human tendency.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:09.800 position:56%
If we had editors from working class
backgrounds we'd have more books

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.500
about working class people.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.550 position:56%
But that simply hasn't been the case
for at least the last generation.

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:17.670
So it is my subject
and it's something

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:22.540 position:56%
that will probably always be my
subject by virtue of where I grew up

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:25.040
and the people I knew growing up.

00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.250
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: But the working
class people you can find them

00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:29.280
in crime fiction.

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.580
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Yes.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.080
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: No, really they exist.

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.290
That's where it happens.

00:21:37.290 --> 00:21:43.010
Character, both of you have
[inaudible] created characters

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:49.140
as you mentioned Julia talking
about Jennifer's work where you --

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.310
the reader just knows
them immediately,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:54.820 position:56%
knows them intimately, very quickly.

00:21:54.820 --> 00:22:00.220
What is the imaginative
mining or what you do

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:04.590
to get inside a character and
literally bring them to life?

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:08.450
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: I get
to start I guess.

00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:10.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: I'm looking at you, yes.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.100
Then I'm going to look at you.

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:16.650
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Well, I do go very,
very deep in fact I think about it

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:23.270
as a kind of mining but I take
my shower before I do the mining,

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:24.570
so [inaudible].

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.710
I've even had critics
write that I frequently,

00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:31.690
not only do I write a lot of
flashback but I write flashbacks

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:34.640
within flashbacks and I have
characters examine not only what

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.400
they think of themselves but what
they think of what they think

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.750
of themselves and I've seen
quotations from my books

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:43.390
to prove it otherwise
I wouldn't believe it.

00:22:43.390 --> 00:22:50.050
I do -- I'm only half joking when
I say the rhythm of my novels

00:22:50.050 --> 00:22:56.450
and the way that I write is what I
call the psychotherapeutic rhythm.

00:22:56.450 --> 00:22:59.940
And that is that I write
along in the present tense

00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.610
in a character's mind for a while
and then I plummet into the past.

00:23:04.610 --> 00:23:07.700
But I don't know when that's going
to happen and then I come back

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.090
to the present and then
I go back to the past.

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:12.730
So it's like being in
the therapist's office

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.830
and you're there complaining about
your day and how your boss was

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.860
such a brute to you, you
didn't get to take a full lunch

00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.170 position:56%
and you're complaining and
complaining and then there's a pause

00:23:22.170 --> 00:23:25.870
and then the therapist says
does that boss remind you

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:27.170
of anybody else in your life?

00:23:27.170 --> 00:23:29.890
And you use as a matter of fact
my mother when I was 16 years old.

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.070
And then you start
talking about your mother

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.240
when you were 16 years old and
then you return to the present.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:39.140
And maybe you thrown in a dream
but I'm always [inaudible]

00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:42.760
but I call myself the
flashback queen and it is

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.670
in my character's histories.

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:50.800
That the essence of
who they are emerges,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:54.330
so I could not possibly
create the characters I do

00:23:54.330 --> 00:23:58.670
without delving very
deeply into what --

00:23:58.670 --> 00:24:02.540
where they come from,
who they come from.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.750
The personal legacy, I
mean we talked about legacy

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:07.840
in a larger sense but
each of us is a legacy.

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.860
The writer Carol [inaudible].

00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:13.770
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Shields.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:19.810
Carol Shields wrote in one of her
novels a line that really moved me

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:25.000
and personally I find it very true,
she said every novel is the story

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.930
of the destiny of a child.

00:24:27.930 --> 00:24:32.020
And in my work that rings
true, it may be many children

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:37.220
but each character's story
is inevitably going to touch

00:24:37.220 --> 00:24:44.930
on their earliest life and
how they grew from there.

00:24:44.930 --> 00:24:47.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: This is something
I really marvel at in Julie's work,

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:52.940 position:56%
there's a real psychological acuity
here, the truth is we are all living

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:55.040
in the past, present and future

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.380
at the same time, at
every given moment.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.790
I mean there's never been a
five minute block of your life

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:03.250
where you didn't think about
something that happened in the past

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.950
or what you're going
to have for dinner.

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:09.960 position:56%
So we do this very naturally all the
time, this kind of time travelling

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.300
in our thoughts and Julie is
really very astute at getting

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:19.810
that on the page, the
kind of human capacity

00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:24.450
to inhabit several different
times frames at once.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:26.790
And I really appreciate
that in her characters.

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.090
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: And well in Heat

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:30.890
and Light it was a
kaleidoscope of characters.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.350
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: That's
a great expression,

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:36.450
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: That was
a lot to hold onto.

00:25:36.450 --> 00:25:39.010
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: I'm never
going to do that again by the way,

00:25:39.010 --> 00:25:41.620
this book almost killed me.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:46.980
There are so many characters
whose head you get inside,

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.340
that was not initially
my plan for this book.

00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:53.390
What happened was I set out
to write this fracking book

00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:55.680
when I didn't really know
very much about the subject.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.500
I knew a little bit and I
thought I had an opinion.

00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:04.420
And what happened was the more
I learned about this question,

00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.240
the more I realized how much
more I still needed to learn.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.380
This is not a screed
against fracking,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.330
it's important to make that point.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:16.850
I would not write such a book and
I certainly wouldn't want to read

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:19.010
such a book, it's not that.

00:26:19.010 --> 00:26:21.820
What I'm doing in this book
is trying to show accurately,

00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.900
well this is how it is regardless
of your opinion on this question,

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:29.960
this is how it is to have a drill
rig 200 yards from your back door.

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.810
What's that like, it's
like this, you know.

00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:36.920
What is it like to be a man who is
separated from his wife and family

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.860
for six months and living
basically a labor camp

00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:42.370
and working 12 hour
shifts on a drill rig.

00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.110
Well, this is what's that's like,
I'll show you what that's like.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:48.510 position:56%
So really that's what I'm doing it's
just sort of a camera and I'm kind

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:53.560
of showing all the facets of this
question and the reader is going

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:56.730
to draw her own conclusions
of course.

00:26:56.730 --> 00:26:58.760
That's not my role as a novelist

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.170
to tell people what they
should believe about fracking.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:05.630
I just want to show as
accurately as I can how it is.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.460
And this is how I ended up with
this massive cast of characters

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:11.470
because every time I
learned something new

00:27:11.470 --> 00:27:14.860
about this question I found myself
inventing a character who inhabits

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:17.340
that part of the argument.

00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.200
So, I talked to a lot of
guys who worked on drill rigs

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.430
and I have a character
who works on a drill rig.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.770
You know, I have a character
who is a CEO of a gas company,

00:27:25.770 --> 00:27:30.970 position:56%
I have a farmer who decides to lease
his mineral rights to a gas company.

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:33.220
And another farmer who
decides not to lease hers.

00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:37.240
I have an environmental activist
and a geologist and you know,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:40.890
all these people whose lives
are affected by this question.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:45.140 position:56%
It's not just the land owner, it's
people who work in the gas industry.

00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.600
It's people who live in this
town and don't even own any land

00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.460
but are effected by what it
does to their surroundings.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.780
So that's how I ended up with
this very you know, populous novel

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.840
with a very complicated structure.

00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.000
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: But that's also
how you can write a book

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.310
that is political but not a screed.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:08.740
But just a really remarkable story

00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:12.160
where these characters
are alive and breathing.

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.880
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Well, thank you,
you know, it's a discovery I made

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:18.410 position:56%
in the writing of this book is that
there are no villains in this story.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.800
I talked to people with a range
of opinions about fracking

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.470
and the conclusion I
came to is that every one

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:27.670
of these people has good
reasons for believing

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.350 position:56%
as he believes and doing as he does.

00:28:30.350 --> 00:28:35.750
There is no villain in this
story, these are people who act

00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:37.590
for understandable reasons.

00:28:37.590 --> 00:28:42.320 position:56%
And I think particularly when you're
writing an issue book like this,

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:47.270
it's very important to make
readers see the humanity of people

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:51.360
who believe differently
from the way they do.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.920
And you know, I did
not meet any villains

00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:57.950
when I was doing the five
years of research for this book

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:02.330
and I didn't write any
villains in the novel.

00:29:02.330 --> 00:29:04.600
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: I want to
touch briefly on research,

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.770
because Julia you both do
research and for that book my lord,

00:29:08.770 --> 00:29:12.060
I can't even begin to
imagine what that was like

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:16.230
and you wrote an essay
about research.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.700
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Oh, the one I
wrote online for Random House?

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:20.000
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Yes.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.300
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Oh,
you're a good detective.

00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:23.230
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Thank you.

00:29:23.230 --> 00:29:26.020
So what are your thoughts
about research,

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.300
when do you let the
research enter into the world

00:29:31.300 --> 00:29:33.500
of the book that you're creating?

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.350
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: For me it depends
on the book that I'm writing.

00:29:38.350 --> 00:29:41.490
You know, if I were writing
the book like Heat and Light,

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:45.780 position:56%
I think I'd have to undertake some
research early on or midway through.

00:29:45.780 --> 00:29:48.260
But my general principle
is that I do research

00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:51.370
as late as I possibly can.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:55.870
And there are sort of two
main reasons for that, one,

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.640
is the I'm lazy and I'd rather
just live in my imagination

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:02.610
and imagine what it would be like.

00:30:02.610 --> 00:30:06.600 position:56%
For instance, I had a character who
was a pastry chef in one of my books

00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:10.320
and all sorts of friends
said oh I know a pastry chef,

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.730
you can go spend a day
with a pastry chef.

00:30:12.730 --> 00:30:15.420
Because I really love desert, you
know, I thought that would be great

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:17.280
because I didn't really
want to do it right away.

00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.350
In fact I joked to my friends
the reason that I was writing

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.690
that novel is so that I could
order desert and call it research.

00:30:23.690 --> 00:30:29.190
But I just, I faked
my way through it.

00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:32.070 position:56%
I imagined what I thought everything
was like, the construction

00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:35.040
of a wedding cake and then I
did my research at the very end,

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:39.080 position:56%
after I had drafted all these
important scenes involving the craft

00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:40.380
of pastry.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.860
And I was wrong about some
things but here's the thing,

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.210
and this is the second reason
I like to do my research late.

00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:50.110
You know, I was that kid who loved
being in the library doing my --

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:52.850
and I wrote the class paper
that was five times as long

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:56.380
as everybody else's whether it
was on volcanos or you know,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:57.690
I was actually obsessed
with volcanos.

00:30:57.690 --> 00:31:00.440
I did one on volcanos and one
on Pompeii and Herculaneum.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:05.060
So I just love finding
stuff out and the problem is

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.620
when you find really cool
stuff out you want to share it.

00:31:07.620 --> 00:31:11.040
And you want to wedge it in there,
you want it to be in the novel

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.140 position:56%
and maybe it doesn't belong there so
if you've already got the framework,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:19.380 position:56%
it's harder to squeeze in all these
really cool stories about the origin

00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:24.000
of wedding cakes in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.070
and the cool stuff I
found out by reading

00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:28.160
about the history of wedding cakes.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.850
And also their architectural
integrity and I'm sure

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:37.420
that if I were researching I'm
sure you found out a lot of stuff

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:40.360
that didn't have a
place in the book.

00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:43.640
So how did you approach
it for this book?

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.960
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Well, this
book I had to do some research

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:49.300
on the front end just to know
what I was talking about.

00:31:49.300 --> 00:31:51.480
My favorite way of doing
research is interviews

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.850
and I interview obsessively, I
talk to lots and lots of people

00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:58.570
and this has been true for
every novel I've written.

00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:03.950
And it's -- yes it is research
but it's more than that.

00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:07.560
I'm not looking for particular
information so much as I want

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.550
to hear the voices of people living
these different kinds of lives.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:15.090
And I find that doing
a lot of interviews

00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:18.030
on the front end suggests
possibilities for characters

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:20.270
that suggest possibilities
for story.

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:26.350
Not just you know, factual things
I need to know but once I start

00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:27.870
to do research I see possibilities

00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:29.800
in the story I wouldn't
have seen otherwise.

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.170
So for me it is integral
to the writing of it,

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:34.330
it's part of how I find the story.

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.460
And it's more true for some
novels than for others.

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.830
Heat and Light was a
massive research undertaking,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:45.190
more so than I realized when
I started out writing it.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:49.600 position:56%
But you know, it was in the process
of doing research that I found a lot

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:52.900
of the story and I often
don't know what I'm looking

00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:54.200
for when I set out looking.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.940
You know, I just want somebody
to say something interesting.

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.640
And if I hear something that
fascinates me I'll follow it,

00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:08.260
I give myself permission always to
follow the thread that fascinates.

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:12.050
Because I have to believe that if
I find something fascinating enough

00:33:12.050 --> 00:33:15.230
that there's something in there the
reader will be fascinated by too.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:20.350 position:56%
So it's really you know, I'm casting
a very wide net in the beginning

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:23.040
when I do research, I don't
quite know what I'm looking for.

00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:25.330
I'm hoping to find my
book out there somewhere.

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.980
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Do you work
closely with your editor?

00:33:27.980 --> 00:33:32.480
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Not on
the front end, no I don't.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.980
I have a terrific editor
and I value him

00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:37.720
and he's immensely
helpful with later drafts.

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:41.710
Nobody, nobody ever sees
my first draft of anything.

00:33:41.710 --> 00:33:44.470
Nobody should ever have to.

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:47.970
My first drafts are hideous
and really I just want

00:33:47.970 --> 00:33:51.550
to burn them always so I
don't share them with anyone.

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.690
I have a couple of readers
who will see maybe a second

00:33:54.690 --> 00:33:58.520
or maybe a third draft,
never the first draft.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.850
And my editor really sees a
fourth or a fifth draft maybe.

00:34:04.850 --> 00:34:07.450
Part of the problem is I don't want
to know what anybody else thinks

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.400
until I know what I think.

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:12.860
You know, it really muddies
the water if you get opinions

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.240
from people before you've
solidified your own.

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:19.000
So I'm very, very cautious
about asking for feedback

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.010
and also cautious about
using up my good readers

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:26.280
because guess what you only get
somebody's first impression once.

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.480
If someone is a good friend
you know, he might be willing

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.680
to read it a second or third time
but he's never going to be able

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.620
to read it with those fresh eyes.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.270
So I don't want to use up that
precious first reading from one

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:40.400
of my good readers until I'm
sure I've gotten it as far

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.220
as I can get it on my own.

00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:44.060
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Julia do you work
closely with your editor?

00:34:44.060 --> 00:34:48.180
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Well,
I -- ditto what she said.

00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:55.900
I love my editor and my weakness
is that every book that I turn

00:34:55.900 --> 00:35:00.690
in to my editor when that draft
is really done has pretentions

00:35:00.690 --> 00:35:01.990
of war and peace.

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:07.490
I turn in these massive things and
now they're done electronically

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:09.810
but I've been writing long enough
to have actually had to mail

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.390
in a manuscript in two UPS
boxes that weighed more

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:17.400
than my healthy, full
term first child.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.180
So, and my editor is the
nicest person in the world

00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:21.840
so she'll receive this and now
she'll receive it electronically

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:24.960
and it still blows my mind that
I push send and whoosh, you know,

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.810
800 pages goes over the cloud.

00:35:27.810 --> 00:35:31.420
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Goes through the cloud.

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.320
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: And she is
always complimentary at first

00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:36.550
and she'll say, if you want

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.000
to publish an 800 page novel
then that's what we'll publish.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.330
And I'm sure she's
lying through her teeth,

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:45.070
she knows I'm going
to say obviously not.

00:35:45.070 --> 00:35:47.050
So and then we talk and what's

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.930
so interesting is the
first conversation we have

00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:50.520
after she finishes the draft,

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.740
it's like we're gossiping
about friends of ours.

00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.460
You know, like well I'm
not really convinced

00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.900
that she fell in love with him.

00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.010
I mean they're getting divorced
but when were they really in love?

00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:03.670
And she will hone in on the things

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:05.610
that were missing and
also she'll say.

00:36:05.610 --> 00:36:10.260
You know, we don't need to know
every single anecdote about so

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:12.470
and so's childhood like
when he lost his first tooth

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:15.020
and the first time he went
tobogganing and you know,

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.350
that first argument he had
with his mother when he was 16.

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:25.190
But she doesn't really lay
a pen on the manuscript,

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:30.330
we have a two hour conversation
and I go away and I know what needs

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:33.170
to go and I know what
needs to be sharpened too.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:37.480
I like to say she's more of
a midwife than a surgeon.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:42.300
And you know, so if my papers
were ever going to be of any value

00:36:42.300 --> 00:36:45.370
to anybody they would be kind
of boring because you know,

00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.820
she maybe cuts a comma
here and there

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:50.870
when it actually comes
to a written manuscript.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:53.720
Is that more or less
true for your editor too

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.200
or is there a lot of
close line editing?

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.800
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Well, you know,
it's because I'm sending in a draft

00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:03.060
that I've been working on
for years that there isn't

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.080
so much on the line level.

00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:10.140
There would be if I made
him read the first draft oh,

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:11.440
there would be blood on the page.

00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.620
But I would never do that to him.

00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:17.240
So it's really by the time he
gets it I've worked through a lot

00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:19.610
of that on my own already.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:25.160
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: The other thing is
I used to, early on I would show

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.130
or even read out loud, this was
really bad, section to my husband

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:30.710
that I was very excited about.

00:37:30.710 --> 00:37:33.750 position:56%
First of all if I read them out loud
it would usually be after dinner

00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:36.530
and I'd be reading and
then I'd hear this noise

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.390
and I thought that's
not snoring is it?

00:37:39.390 --> 00:37:41.950
That's really not good for anybody.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:45.640
But then the other thing is
if I gave it to him to read,

00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.780
he would come away and say oh,

00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:50.510
this character Carl is
that our friend Tom?

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:53.530
I'd go that is not our friend Tom
and then I'd go bad to working

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.380
on the book and all I
could think about is Tom.

00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:59.750 position:56%
So he doesn't get to see it any
sooner than anybody else does either

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.540
and some of my friends
think that's strange.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:05.460
But no he does not get to see
it until my editor and my agent

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.020
and my husband all see
it at the same time.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.650
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Jennifer you once said

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:15.510
that each book is an engineering
feat, that it has to work

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:18.850
and I was really intrigued by
that and I'd like you to say more.

00:38:18.850 --> 00:38:22.080 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Yeah,
absolutely, you know, I'm fascinated

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.640
by machines, I love writing about
machines and I think of a novel

00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.820 position:56%
as an extremely complicated machine.

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.340
The best comparison I can think
of, some of you are old enough

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.340
to remember this old board
game called Mouse Trap.

00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.640
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Oh, I love that.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.730
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Who remembers
Mouse Trap, oh, like everyone.

00:38:39.730 --> 00:38:43.720
Okay, so Mouse Trap for those
who don't know it the object

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.940
of the game is to build
this complicated,

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:49.010
ridiculous Rube Goldberg
type mouse trap

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:52.180
out of the dispirit plastic parts.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:55.780
So there is like a rain gutter
and there's a stair case

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.530
and there's a crank you
turn and there's a bathtub

00:38:58.530 --> 00:39:01.720
and these unlikely parts
that you string them together

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.720
and finally it's a trap
that will catch a mouse

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.080 position:56%
in the most convoluted possible way.

00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:11.080
That to me is the perfect
metaphor for writing a novel,

00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:17.450
that you are building a story out
of found objects in a certain way

00:39:17.450 --> 00:39:20.800
and it's a mechanism
that you want to be able

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:24.050
to flip a switch and have it work.

00:39:24.050 --> 00:39:28.170
So when the first draft what I'm
doing is building this mousetrap

00:39:28.170 --> 00:39:29.880
out of these dispirit parts.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:33.440
Then what I'm doing afterward
is just testing and retesting

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:37.360
and retesting the trap until
it actually catches the mouse.

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:40.680
So I write a first draft, and I
kind of reverse engineer the thing

00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:43.160
and I look at where are
the pinch points, you know,

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.870
where does the ball roll off track,
where do the gears get gummed

00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.010
and I go in and fix those
in a very mechanistic way.

00:39:49.010 --> 00:39:51.990
And then I run the trap again
and I find the ball gets stuck

00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:56.180
in a different palce then I
go an diagnose those problems.

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.830
So it's a very -- my process

00:39:57.830 --> 00:40:01.260
of revision is quite mechanical
and I really enjoy that.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:05.390
You know, I think of a novel as
being like a car, I love cars

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:08.190
and I find cars beautiful.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:11.040
But you know, when you turn the
key in the ignition all you care is

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.900
that the engine turns over.

00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:18.490
So with a novel yeah you want
to build a beautiful machine

00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:21.670
but the thing in the
end just needs to work.

00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:24.630
So that's kind of what my
revision process looks like.

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.760
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Does that
make sense to you?

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:31.720
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: I'm listening
really hard, I'm terrible with cars

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:35.450
so maybe I need to
pay more attention.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:40.010
That's a fascinating metaphor and
you know, with my students you talk

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:44.420
about the engine turning over and
obviously I teach fiction writing

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:47.620
and the first thing that
I have my students do

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:52.610
for the first class is they have
to bring in the first page only

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:55.690
of a favorite short story or novel.

00:40:55.690 --> 00:40:58.540
That they love in its entirety but
they really love the beginning too.

00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:03.280
And we dissect that beginning
because I say if you don't start

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.540
in the right place, if you
don't pull the reader in

00:41:07.540 --> 00:41:08.840
and I don't mean you
have to hook them

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.900
with a dead body or
anything like that.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:12.490
I mean it may be language
that hooks them in,

00:41:12.490 --> 00:41:14.600
it may be a lingering
question that's already there

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.580
on that first page.

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.690
Then you're already the
journey is off to a bad start.

00:41:20.690 --> 00:41:24.230
So I focus a lot on that, you know,
is it beginning in the right place,

00:41:24.230 --> 00:41:26.920
is it beginning in the right
tone and we dissect beginnings.

00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:28.700
So I think that's kind of
like the engine turning over.

00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:34.550
And then you know, after that
it's a lot more work of course.

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:38.740
I love what Sue Miller
said about writing a novel,

00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:40.670
she said that writing a novel is

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:46.300
like knitting an argyle sock
the size of a football field.

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.820
Maybe that's more monotonous.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.350
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: And a word
about endings,

00:41:53.350 --> 00:41:55.550 position:56%
endings are very hard to accomplish.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:42:01.040
How many go rounds do you
typically have to do before land

00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.300
on what you think is the
palce you want to end.

00:42:06.300 --> 00:42:08.310
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: I
find endings so difficult

00:42:08.310 --> 00:42:10.930
that it makes me hate the
whole first draft of the book

00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:13.810
because I'm living in fear that
I'm going to get the ending wrong.

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:16.260
You know, we've all had
this experience as readers

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:18.100
where you fall in love
with the book.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:21.200
You fall in love with the
characters and the ending is

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.710
so horribly disappointing
that you want

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:24.780
to through the thing
across the room.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:28.830 position:56%
Now you will forever remember that
as a novel with the terrible ending.

00:42:28.830 --> 00:42:31.760
You won't remember it as the
novel with the great beginning.

00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:36.590
So it's kind of like you know, when
you're learning to fly a plane,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:38.780
it's great if you have a
beautiful take off but if screw

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:41.080
up the landing no one is
going to remember that.

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.380
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Including you.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:45.140 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Very much like
that writing a novel, so I have lots

00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:50.570
of anxiety around it and you know,
I usually do get the ending wrong

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:51.970
on the first draft, I don't know

00:42:51.970 --> 00:42:55.600
that I've ever really gotten
it right on the first go.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:43:01.050
So it is fraught and it is the
sort of thing that you keep writing

00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:03.750
and writing and writing
until you find it.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.830
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Well, the way
I write is I don't write draft,

00:43:06.830 --> 00:43:11.060
after draft, after draft I write
forward back, forward back.

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:13.520
I think partly because
I'm so obsessive

00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.270
about getting sentences right.

00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:19.430
Things that I can't -- I'll
remember a sentence two pages ago

00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:20.860
that just wasn't right.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.630
So every time I sit down to write I
may intend to write ten more pages

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:26.810
but I may end up spending
three hours working

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:28.580
on the last ten pages that I wrote.

00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:31.930
I don't make myself go forward
if I'm not going to get there.

00:43:31.930 --> 00:43:36.680
So what happens is it really takes
me a long time to reach the end

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:39.910
and during that time I may
have had different ideas

00:43:39.910 --> 00:43:42.550
about the ending I'm
going to arrive at.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:48.320
But by the time I get to that last
chapter literally I've been working

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:51.860
on the book for probably at
least a year if not more.

00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.310
And so I'm almost more
qualified to find the right end,

00:43:56.310 --> 00:44:01.860
that doesn't mean it won't change
but I'm not doing first draft,

00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.690
second draft, third
draft and so forth.

00:44:04.690 --> 00:44:08.090
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: And that leads exactly
to the question I wanted to ask

00:44:08.090 --> 00:44:11.730
which is your both
midcareer novelist

00:44:11.730 --> 00:44:15.610
with five or six novels each.

00:44:15.610 --> 00:44:20.130
When you think back to
when you started writing

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:24.400
and the things you thought you'd be
exploring or that made you curious

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:30.160
or that drove you to the page, in
the first place do you see changes

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.360
from the writer you are now?

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:39.910
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Well, you know
talked about you would not return

00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:43.750
to your town, to Pennsylvania.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:46.210
And I was certain that
I would never return

00:44:46.210 --> 00:44:48.010
to the characters in my first book.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.660
Well, in fact some of them have
recurred in two further books.

00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:53.800 position:56%
So I never say never about anything.

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:57.940
I think that one thing
I've learned to do

00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:00.700
through my books is I've
learned to be more forgiving

00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:02.530
of myself, for one thing.

00:45:02.530 --> 00:45:04.950
Not to be so scared
that I can't do it

00:45:04.950 --> 00:45:07.000
because I've done it before, right.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.870
So if I get stuck I don't get
as panicky, I also I did not go

00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:14.510
to a MFA program or have any
creative writing training,

00:45:14.510 --> 00:45:18.470 position:56%
I actually majored in art in college
and I took only two English classes.

00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:21.820
I didn't really like them, I mean
I was always good at writing.

00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.450
But I really started writing
fiction seriously in my early 30's

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:30.940
and so all I had to go on were
essays I'd read about writing.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:36.190
You know I bought writing guides
and I find that I absorbed

00:45:36.190 --> 00:45:38.670
so many dogmatic pieces of advice

00:45:38.670 --> 00:45:42.110
from writers whether they were
Stephen King or Anne Lamott.

00:45:42.110 --> 00:45:44.890
That they didn't fit me
and I felt guilty or I felt

00:45:44.890 --> 00:45:46.910
like I'm not a real writer
because I don't write every day.

00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:50.500
Or I'm not a real writer
because I don't do this or that.

00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:54.580
And I've learned that every
writer makes his or her own rules.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.070
It doesn't mean you can't read
what other people have to say.

00:45:57.070 --> 00:46:01.790
So I feel much more confident and
maybe able to take more chances.

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:06.270
But I also find that certain themes
come back again and again for me.

00:46:06.270 --> 00:46:09.520
And I'm not one of those
writers who is going

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:12.560
to write the completely different
novel every time I sit down.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.860
I think there are people like that.

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:16.720
I think Jennifer Egan is
one who really has a --

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:19.700
but you know the world of
paining and I returned to that.

00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:23.420
I'm more like the painter
Morandi who I really revered

00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:27.300
who did these amazing still
life's at variations on a theme

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.410
and I think that's
who I am as a writer.

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:32.700
So if I return, if characters
come back to me, if I write again

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.340
about New York in the plague
years which is something I seem

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:36.930
to return to again and again.

00:46:36.930 --> 00:46:43.340
Then that's who I am and I
occupy that territory more

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.890 position:56%
and more confidently I think and not
feeling like I need to make excuses

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:49.310
if I write about the same thing.

00:46:49.310 --> 00:46:51.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: You still have questions
about it that you want to explore.

00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:52.760
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: I do, yeah.

00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.060
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Jennifer?

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.360
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: You know

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.760
when I was writing my first novel
I had no idea what I was doing.

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:01.550 position:56%
It's writing the first novel is kind
of like running the first marathon.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:04.150
You're not trying to
win you just don't want

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.730
to die while you're doing it.

00:47:06.730 --> 00:47:10.640
So my goal was just to live through
the writing of that first novel

00:47:10.640 --> 00:47:13.800
and to write a book
that I'd want to read.

00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:17.500
You know, I don't have particularly
exotic tastes as a reader

00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.360
and I figure if it's
a book that I want

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:22.490 position:56%
to read then somebody somewhere else
is going to want to read it also.

00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:26.420
So that's all I was trying to do
is live through the writing process

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.980
and write a book that
I would want to read.

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.260
As I've gotten further
along you know,

00:47:33.260 --> 00:47:38.670
I'm drawn to some different
subjects I guess.

00:47:38.670 --> 00:47:43.050
But that's still really the guiding
principle to me to write a book

00:47:43.050 --> 00:47:44.350
that I would want to read.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:47.800
When I wrote my first novel
I thought okay it's going

00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.140
to be easier now.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.220
You know, now I know
how to write a novel,

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.230
it will never be this hard again.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:55.810
I was entirely wrong about that.

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.030
What I learned was yes I
know how to write a novel

00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.820
but I only know how
to write that novel.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.140
And the lessons I learned were
not particularly portable,

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:06.940
I could not apply them to my
second or my third or my forth.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.390 position:56%
So in a certain way it's starting
at zero every time for me, you know,

00:48:11.390 --> 00:48:14.230
I always feel like I'm an imposter,

00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:16.000
I am completely unqualified
to do this.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.220
&gt;&gt; Julia Glass: Well, I think we
all -- what we do is so weird,

00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.840
we just sit there and make stuff up
like why are we doing this thing.

00:48:22.840 --> 00:48:25.480
So I certainly have those
moments of like what

00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.440
in the world am I doing here.

00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.390
But don't you feel having
completed, like don't you get,

00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:33.910
like I say in the middle
of the ocean

00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:37.020
where you can't see the horizons
on either side and you don't know

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.260
if you have enough
water to make it across.

00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:41.300
Don't you tell yourself
I've done this before

00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:46.110
and I know I'll do it again, or
does it really feel like starting

00:48:46.110 --> 00:48:47.500
from zero again each time?

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:48.950
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh:
Certainly the first year,

00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:51.590
the first year it absolutely
does, yeah.

00:48:51.590 --> 00:48:53.020
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Okay and
there we have to leave it

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:54.520
because time has gotten away.

00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:55.820
&gt;&gt; Jennifer Haigh: Okay.

00:48:55.820 --> 00:48:57.970
&gt;&gt; Jo Reed: Julia Glass
her most recent book is,

00:48:57.970 --> 00:48:59.550
A House Among the Trees.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:03.910
And Jennifer Haigh, Heat and
Light just came out in paperback,

00:49:03.910 --> 00:49:08.180
thank you, it was wonderful,
thank you.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:10.490
