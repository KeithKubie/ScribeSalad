I've said that earthquakes can occur

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570
I've said that earthquakes can occur
 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.690
I've said that earthquakes can occur
anywhere but they're more likely some

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700
anywhere but they're more likely some
 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.240
anywhere but they're more likely some
places than others so you know basic

faults that might cause an earthquake
 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.030
faults that might cause an earthquake
that's a matter of public education but

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040
that's a matter of public education but
 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.310
that's a matter of public education but
once you know what your risk might be

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:41.320
once you know what your risk might be
 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.080
once you know what your risk might be
you have to make some sort of personal

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090
you have to make some sort of personal
 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.300
you have to make some sort of personal
judgment or if you're a government some

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:46.310
judgment or if you're a government some
 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.040

sort of social judgement about the level
 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.320
sort of social judgement about the level
of risk that you're willing to accept it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330
of risk that you're willing to accept it
 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.660
of risk that you're willing to accept it
is going to be and if you're willing to

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670
is going to be and if you're willing to
 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.940

accept or only willing to accept a low
 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.920
accept or only willing to accept a low
level of risk then there are a number of

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930
level of risk then there are a number of
 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.540
level of risk then there are a number of
things you need to do you need to ensure

that but that basically is a situation
and sad to say that's tapped us

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020
and sad to say that's tapped us
 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.030
and sad to say that's tapped us
throughout the world so you know that

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040
throughout the world so you know that
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.260
throughout the world so you know that
the basic things are really quite easy

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270
the basic things are really quite easy
 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.660
the basic things are really quite easy
to do if you've got the money to do them

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670
to do if you've got the money to do them
 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.680
to do if you've got the money to do them
and if you've got the public awareness

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
and if you've got the public awareness

and if you've got the public awareness
to do them and if you've got the

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430
to do them and if you've got the
 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.800
to do them and if you've got the
political will to do them if you're

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810
political will to do them if you're
 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.660
political will to do them if you're
dealing with the Commons if you're

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670

don't have the political will or the
 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.790
don't have the political will or the
wealth there are a number of things that

wealth there are a number of things that

the community is trying to do there's a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
the community is trying to do there's a
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.430
the community is trying to do there's a
lot of concentration on building

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440
lot of concentration on building
 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280
lot of concentration on building
small-scale community awareness so that

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290
small-scale community awareness so that
 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.080
small-scale community awareness so that
the awareness of disaster the awareness

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
the awareness of disaster the awareness
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.560
the awareness of disaster the awareness
of potential disaster I should say

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570
of potential disaster I should say
 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.700
of potential disaster I should say
occurs almost at the household level and

things that they that they could do on a

day to day basis not just for
 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.120

earthquakes but for floods for
 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.400
earthquakes but for floods for
landslides and for that matter for

one of the key things that we're doing
 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.150
one of the key things that we're doing
at our Institute and and elsewhere is

at our Institute and and elsewhere is
 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.380
at our Institute and and elsewhere is
trying to to bring the knowledge we have

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390
trying to to bring the knowledge we have
 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.930

of the things we're trying to do is to
bring that knowledge not just throw it

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690
bring that knowledge not just throw it
 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.510
bring that knowledge not just throw it
over the fence so that policymakers can

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520
over the fence so that policymakers can
 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.280
over the fence so that policymakers can
use it because you know there's not a

use it because you know there's not a
 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.130
