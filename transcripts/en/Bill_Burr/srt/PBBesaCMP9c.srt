1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,120
Husband and he's like sitting
there sipping into what's going on,

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:04,200
what's going on?

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:07,410
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

4
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:11,550
February 13th,

5
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,630
2017 what's going on out? Why? Yeah.
Oh y'all. How are you doing over there?

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,480
Why is it uh,

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:23,480
why is Friday the 13th on lucky Monday
the 13th all that's just fucking fuck.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,790
You know, it was a put, so
you came up with that one.

9
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:31,500
You think Monday the 13th fuck you're
unlucky 13 and it's Monday and I got five

10
00:00:31,501 --> 00:00:35,460
fucking days in front of me. I have
to work Friday 13 who gives a shit?

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,450
You stub your toe a couple of times and
next thing you know you're at the TGI

12
00:00:39,451 --> 00:00:44,440
Friday's right? You're down there
eyeball and one of the lady,

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,480
yeah, we'd come up to her. You
tell her you like her stripe shirt.

14
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,400
Start bitching about the horrible day
you had, you know, and she's a woman,

15
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:54,840
so she'll listen to it.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:59,320
She'll kick into that motherly instinct
unless she already has kids and then she

17
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:02,730
doesn't have time for it, you know? Then
she looks and just says, listen mate,

18
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,850
sucking your Dick. All right,

19
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,500
so just get the fuck out of here and
then you move on to something yoga.

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,830
So then I'll goes, why? What is
so fucking unlucky? You know what?

21
00:01:11,831 --> 00:01:13,600
I didn't even know I was going
to. I got to look this up now,

22
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,220
why is Friday the 13th unlucky. Hang
on a stomach. Hit pause for a second.

23
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,210
Alright, before I can, I just looked
it up. I didn't read any. I just got,

24
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,570
I just got to the Google thing where they
get whatever it is on the first page.

25
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,560
All right. Who's kid knew with the
Internet? Whatever the fact is,

26
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:33,790
the fact is whatever you look up within
the first two fucking clicks on the

27
00:01:33,791 --> 00:01:38,350
first page becomes the
truth. That's it. Okay,

28
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:39,910
so that's what the fuck I'm looking at.

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:45,930
You know if the right answer
to any question is fucking
beyond what you have to

30
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:51,110
scroll down on the first page of any
subject on a of the Internet, it's,

31
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,470
it's over. No one's ever going
to know the truth because it who?

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:55,660
Who the fuck ever goes to page 14

33
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,750
okay.

34
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,080
Not even journalists do that. They
don't give a shit. I'm all right.

35
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,230
I'm going to say it
either has to do with, uh,

36
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,450
it's gotta be religious. It's gotta
be religious. Jesus did something.

37
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,710
He always had bad Friday. Sydney.
No, he had a good Friday. Good.

38
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,450
Today's Good Friday. What
happened on Good Friday? Did He,

39
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,160
the little rock roll
back. He came walking up,

40
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:22,661
you know,

41
00:02:22,661 --> 00:02:25,180
like one of those fucking movies where
they thought they killed the guy and he

42
00:02:25,181 --> 00:02:27,430
didn't. And then he comes back. Step,

43
00:02:27,431 --> 00:02:30,910
not like Tom Sawyer fucking creep
hanging out at his own funeral.

44
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,690
I was done with that kid
once he did that shows like,

45
00:02:33,691 --> 00:02:36,500
this kid's a fucking
Weirdo. I'm all right. Fine.

46
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:41,520
13th why is it unlucky and other facts
about the worst day in the calendar?

47
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,340
In the calendar, not on the calendar.
We're in it. We're not in it.

48
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:49,390
We're not on it. Right? Find it.

49
00:02:49,391 --> 00:02:54,220
13th considered by many is one of the
unluckiest days of the year is almost here

50
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:59,150
again. This is from January, 2017. Oh.

51
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,510
Oh Shit. January 13th well fuck. Nothing
happened to us if he's still alive. Um,

52
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,900
if you're worried about
what's in storable, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

53
00:03:06,901 --> 00:03:11,010
blah, blah, blah, what the fuck in
2007 here's some of the fun facts.

54
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,530
When is the next Friday? The
13th now, why stupid? All right.

55
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:20,680
Biblical orange origins. All right.
Course. It always goes back to the Bible.

56
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,430
Oh Jesus. Dad's mad. Dad's coming home.

57
00:03:24,431 --> 00:03:29,110
He's not in a good fucking mood.
He had a bad week, you know?

58
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,170
Of course it's the kids fault. Stupid con.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,660
He tried to build everything
in six fucking days.

60
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,630
Typical do it yourself job.

61
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:40,450
Why didn't you farm it out to someone
who knew what the fuck they were doing?

62
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,160
Built the thing up to code.

63
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:47,330
You Dope fucking sticking a steel beam
in the middle of a fucking wood wall.

64
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,230
Yeah. Everything above it is supported
better. What about below it? That,

65
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,140
what about below it? The fuck
did this music come from?

66
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:59,270
All right, let's read with this
music on in the background.

67
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:01,060
[inaudible]

68
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,300
the superstition about
this day is not to have,

69
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:07,540
I can't do this to have come about.

70
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:10,510
All right. That's enough of that.

71
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,350
During the Middle Ages in
many have biblical origins,

72
00:04:14,351 --> 00:04:18,820
some historians have claimed it was the
day on which he bit the apple from the

73
00:04:18,821 --> 00:04:20,830
tree of knowledge. Jesus Christ.

74
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,223
Hmm.

75
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:28,370
Holy. That just scared the shit out of
me. Nia, the lovely Nia. Everybody. Oh,

76
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:32,270
with my beautiful daughter.
Two lovely ladies.

77
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,640
What's going on? Uh, I thought
you were done. Sorry. No,

78
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,490
I was watching the videos that people
sent me this week. What's going on?

79
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,310
Or you're going to drop her off? No,
I can't do the podcast the way I talk.

80
00:04:44,311 --> 00:04:47,660
That's why I was in here with the door
closed. It's a pocket door, by the way.

81
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:51,770
If you wonder why you're squeak.
Like we live in a haunted house. No,

82
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,640
I just found another,

83
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:56,150
I just saw another place that I wanted
to show you that maybe you wanted to

84
00:04:56,151 --> 00:05:00,410
order from. Yeah, just order me
something remotely healthy. Okay.

85
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,940
Something to stave off the calories I
consume in alcohol. Okay. What'd you like?

86
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:09,350
Some sort of like a, a bowl, like with
rice and Tofu and that sort of thing.

87
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:13,280
I hate Tofu. It's gotta be a real dead
animal that have vegetables. Okay,

88
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,143
so you want,

89
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
you want meat so I shouldn't order
from a vegan place then I like,

90
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,660
I'm Vegan. As long as
there's none of that Tofu,

91
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,190
I don't understand what that stuff is.

92
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,500
That's like the type of shit that
they seal capsule with. So, Tofu. Yes.

93
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,260
So liquid doesn't be good. It's not
good for you. Tofu is not good for,

94
00:05:30,261 --> 00:05:33,170
you know, are you sure you're
thinking of Tofu or are you,

95
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,230
what is Tofu doesn't come from a tree,
does it? There's no Tofu. Food. Trees.

96
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,620
I thought TOEFL was made from soybeans.
Yeah, but isn't soy bad for you?

97
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,370
Not always. I have no, wait,
let me get your phone for you.

98
00:05:46,371 --> 00:05:48,500
I don't know if you're going
to order from a Vegan place.

99
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,920
Just get me vegetables, shit that
I, I, you know, I know what it is.

100
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,960
I know what it is. I
don't know what Tofu is.

101
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:59,730
It's like fucking algae or
something. Okay. All right. Shuffles.

102
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,640
Nia. Do you know why Friday the 13th
is unlucky. Why? I don't know either.

103
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,390
I've been reading about it
here. The new and then uh,

104
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:10,420
they try to say that Eve
fucking maybe bit the apple. Oh,

105
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,760
they went paradise. There was no calendar.
What do they have to worry about?

106
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:17,480
Snow bills. They didn't have to
go to work as a woman. You know,

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,870
what are they doing in
fucking eat off shit. Monday.

108
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,290
Same Shit ever day. It's fucking paradise.

109
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,380
No salad though.

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,600
I also don't understand
why if it was paradise,

111
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:32,630
why they had a fucking snake in
there trying to fuck everything up.

112
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,873
What was the devil?

113
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,480
Yeah, but that's on God.

114
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,070
The God and the devil
are two separate. Yeah.

115
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,440
They're not too safe. God
made everything else I made.

116
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,990
He also made the contact
ball constantly. Not,

117
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,990
I don't think. Oh no, but the
devil was an angel that got Casco.

118
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,720
So the devil was
basically a bad hire. Yes.

119
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:56,130
That came back and tried to take his
company down. All right. Yeah. Okay.

120
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,090
Let me finish reading this.
Okay. In the New Testament, um,

121
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,010
I love how they blame the woman. Like,
that's why everything's all fucked up.

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,450
I mean, without a doubt,

123
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:08,510
if you told abroad did not go over
there and eat the fucking apple,

124
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,190
she's going to be intrigued.

125
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:11,190
Yeah.

126
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:15,900
You know, like a guy wouldn't, whatever
you day. That's still classic thing.

127
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:18,480
Like at substitute teaching,
whatever you do, don't laugh.

128
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:20,910
Next person who lapse gets
detention. That's it. You're done.

129
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,650
You fucking squeeze in your nose
doing that fucking little kid laugh.

130
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:29,310
That's it, nick. See, no, you
missing a week of research, a recess.

131
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,800
That's why you got all
these fat fucking kids.

132
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,050
The regular teacher takes the day off.

133
00:07:35,051 --> 00:07:37,690
The substitute teacher creates
the tension though. The,

134
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:40,090
the one skinny kid starts
laughing and then he's done.

135
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:44,880
He's eaten that fucking food down the
cafeteria that's got all the preservatives

136
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:47,730
in it. Do you know if you
fucking kill somebody in the end?

137
00:07:47,731 --> 00:07:50,670
Nobody figures it out. You're not
in the clear for a good 40 years.

138
00:07:50,671 --> 00:07:53,970
That's how let the digging people up
from 12 years ago and then that's like,

139
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:57,840
they took a fucking nap. Hey,
I'll tell you, these people,

140
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,080
they're full of preservatives, you
know? All right. And the New Testament,

141
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,620
there were 13 people present for
Jesus. Jesus, his last supper

142
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,370
on Monday. Thursday.

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,033

00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,790
Monty m. M. A. U. N. D. Y. Is that
some other fucking day of the week?

145
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:15,624
They used to have,

146
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,420
what do you mean the new testament
that wasn't in the Old Testament. Oh,

147
00:08:19,421 --> 00:08:19,811

148
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:24,760

Crucifixion on Good
Friday. Oh, Good Friday.

150
00:08:29,271 --> 00:08:31,670
See when Audi had a couple of
bears, he had a good fucking time.

151
00:08:31,671 --> 00:08:34,520
And the next thing you know, you've got
the old right there, Fred. All right,

152
00:08:34,521 --> 00:08:39,140

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:41,420
1307 Phillip, the fourth of France.

154
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:46,880

of the knights Templar

157
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:01,320
Dan Brown cites the 14th century
execution. Oh, who gives a fuck?

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,950
You know what I mean? You know something,

159
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:11,320
it's, it's just all bullshit. That's
what it is. You always knew it was,

160
00:09:11,321 --> 00:09:13,600
I'm trying to think of any
bad's ever happened on the 13th,

161
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,930
but I pay on Fadiman.

162
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,770
Fucking old ladies keeping that shit

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,210
You know what the Fuck I did today?
You know what my dumb ass did?

182
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,290
Today's I getting on the elliptical,
which was a good thing. All right.

183
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:48,850
I took my life insurance fucking test.
This guy had a problem hitting my vein.

184
00:10:48,851 --> 00:10:51,850
He goes, you're going to bruise a little
bit. You should see me. I look like a,

185
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,870
okay.

186
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,310
I don't look like I've been doing smack.

187
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:59,000
I just look like somebody just
pinched my fucking inside of my elbow.

188
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:05,210
Really fucking hard. Um,
anyway, so I did all that. Ugh.

189
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:10,640
What a shit show that was fucking guys
sitting there going did drink it all

190
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,120
right. And like, wait, he's
got his back to my bar,

191
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:19,040
which I told you his murderer's row,
the bottles I have there. I told you I,

192
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:22,910
right now I put it up against
the 27 Yankees, the 96 balls.

193
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,170
Let's go some underrated
teams. The 83 76 hours.

194
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:30,230
Some are lost in history about how
fucking great they were. Right.

195
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,620
The 86 Celtics, the 85 Lakers,

196
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,360
the fucking in 2060 New England patriots,

197
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:45,870
the 98 Yankees, that was a great team
for the fucking free agent there waiting.

198
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,500
I mean, speaking of which, now that
the red sox are doing that this year,

199
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,970
that's a good year to get the package.

200
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,010
No matter what you're going
to be entertained. You,

201
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:57,340
they get to watch like a fucking $900
million team, shit the bed or just,

202
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:00,370
you know, there is no Santa Clause.
We're buying one or the other.

203
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,680
Either way it's going to be
dramatic. Um, so anyways, I got uh,

204
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,280
such a funny question. I'm like,
drinks, tea. I don't fucking know.

205
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:11,950
Okay.

206
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,660
Do I have a pocket protector? I don't
count them. I like, you know, they,

207
00:12:16,661 --> 00:12:17,720
they always, you know what's funny,

208
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:22,190
they fucking say having a glass of wine
with your meal is actually good for you.

209
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,530
You know what I mean? So I mean,
I don't, I don't understand that.

210
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,060
Okay.

211
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,160
The smoke. Yeah. Yellow a little bit.

212
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,500
It's fucking lying your ass off. Um,

213
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:35,240
okay.

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,090
Oh, Jesus. I W can you imagine
if he, if can't imagine anybody,

215
00:12:38,091 --> 00:12:40,730
even the fucking people who work there,
if you answered any of those questions,

216
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:43,340
fucking honestly. You know
what I mean? Alright. Uh,

217
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:47,090
Bruins and I probably shouldn't be
talking about this. Who gives a shit?

218
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,250
There's a comedy podcast. These
are all jokes. Everybody. Um,

219
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,040
this is what I did today. My fucking
dumb ass did today. So, you know,

220
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:59,400
I'm gonna be the person presenter
at the writers guild. No, the,

221
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:04,010
the, yeah, the writer's guild
awards thing, right? And,

222
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,790

tie thing and I'm, my God, fuck,

223
00:13:07,791 --> 00:13:10,460
I gotta get a fucking Tuxedo. So
I call up. By the time I call up,

224
00:13:10,461 --> 00:13:12,530
it's too late to get one. So Nia,

225
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:14,690
Google sent pictures and
everybody seems like relaxed.

226
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:17,030
Like they're just wearing suits
with a black tie. So I say, fuck it.

227
00:13:17,031 --> 00:13:20,090
I wear one of my suits. I pull
out a suit, I get the shirt,

228
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:22,160
we do the whole fucking thing.
I got it to go in all that.

229
00:13:22,161 --> 00:13:25,780
So today I'm dressing up, you know,

230
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,570
I'm hanging with my daughter.
I'm putting my time in, you know,

231
00:13:28,571 --> 00:13:29,590
cause I'm gonna be gone for three,

232
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:34,300
four hours and a Nia is going to be
handled by herself and I'm going to go out

233
00:13:34,301 --> 00:13:37,000
and go do this, this fucking
Hollywood thing, right. And uh,

234
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:39,580
and I'm sitting there
and I know, you know,

235
00:13:39,581 --> 00:13:41,980
the red carpet and everything's
between three or four. And I'm like,

236
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,830
can I can't, I don't know when the
fuck the car's coming to pick me up.

237
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,350
I'm all dressed up, ready to go, you
know, two o'clock two oh five to 10 to 15.

238
00:13:50,351 --> 00:13:54,160
I'm texting people, hey, once his car
coming to get me to 25, I walk outside,

239
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,540
I'm looking around, I don't see anybody

240
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,890
just sitting there and it finally
dawns on me. I'm like, wait a minute.

241
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,910
And I just looked up the date of the
fucking awards show. It's next Sunday.

242
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:12,430
That hilarious. You know, the funny thing
about it is it is Nia got mad at me.

243
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,750
What did you write things
down? Don't give it up.

244
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:18,330
Okay.

245
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,130
It's not, I didn't miss it. I just was
a little early and now I know, you know,

246
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,770
I know that you know, I
know what I'm going to wear.

247
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,290
I'm actually way ahead of the
game cause I cause I fucked up.

248
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:34,240
What do you want from me?
Um, anyway, speaking of,

249
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:38,350
uh, this is something I've got to
let you guys know about. Um, the, uh,

250
00:14:38,351 --> 00:14:41,800
the Patrice O'Neal comedy
benefit, the fifth annual,

251
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,610
but Theresa Neil comedy
event, uh, benefit, uh,

252
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:50,200
we're actually going to be
releasing some, um, some tickets,

253
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:54,230
some a high quality tickets I guess you
say some really good seats and we're

254
00:14:54,231 --> 00:14:58,010
going to be doing that, uh, Monday
today. If you listen to it on Monday,

255
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,740
Jesus Christ with the fucking open under
the door there because it's ridiculous.

256
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:08,030
That's why. What is ridiculous, Amy,
on the podcast? Oh, am I trashing you?

257
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,630
Because you were saying like, I got mad
at you because you can we come here,

258
00:15:11,631 --> 00:15:14,150
come here, come, come in here, come in
and come in and don't yell, don't yell.

259
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:18,770
You got the kid there. What?

260
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:23,870
It's absolutely absurd for you to
not know when things are anymore.

261
00:15:23,871 --> 00:15:28,220
It's like you're a grown ass man and
you've got all dressed to go to this.

262
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,950
Why is it always grown ass? Why
can't you say you're grown up?

263
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:35,250
I can say whatever I want to say and I'm
choosing to say that you're a grown ass

264
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:38,760
man who can't seem to write anything
down yet because you're a strong woman to

265
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:41,340
the point where you're going to get
all dressed up and be like, well,

266
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,900
what am I going to wear?
There's none the other,

267
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,270
and then you come downstairs
five minutes later like, well,

268
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,120
it's next week with you.
You need to get it together.

269
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:52,140
It's not cute.

270
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,813
Okay.

271
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:58,210
Yeah. That's like the first thing
I've screwed up like that a long time.

272
00:15:58,211 --> 00:16:01,270
I have a bunch of events in my
phone right in the calendar section

273
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,500
we're getting when things are,

274
00:16:02,501 --> 00:16:06,130
you're always getting the dates wrong
and it's frustrating. It's just annoying.

275
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,513
Yeah.

276
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:09,510
All right, but how am I doing as a dad?

277
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,380
What does that have to do with anything
you're doing? Amazingly as all right.

278
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:17,400
We'll stop acting like I'm in some pain
shooting heroin in an alley and I'm not

279
00:16:17,401 --> 00:16:20,640
acting like get shooting heroin
in an alley, but you just need,

280
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:24,060
I just don't understand why you can't
ever get your schedule straight.

281
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:28,050
You're always getting the dates wrong.
Like, oh, it's tomorrow. Not Today.

282
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,620
It's next week. Not this week.
Like I don't have them get it.

283
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,830
Yeah, I'm busy, but I don't
have an assistant. You will.

284
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:38,580
You should get an assistant. I don't
want another person to talk to.

285
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,590
I've been telling you to get an assistant
for like three years now because of

286
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:45,270
this very reason.

287
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,721
Yeah.

288
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:49,050
You want to hear all this shit I did this
week that I made totally got there on

289
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:52,200
time. No, you don't. Okay. You know why?

290
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,420
Because that would prove my point
if I was a baseball. What is your,

291
00:16:54,421 --> 00:16:58,970
what is your point exactly? At 99% of
Shit, I get there on time. 99% well,

292
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,930
98 no.

293
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:07,560
When you did get mad at me, I'm not.
I did well then. What's the problem?

294
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,190
Why did you have to dramatically open
our squeaky pocket door to come in here

295
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:12,900
and cert yourself on the podcast?

296
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,410
I Dunno. All right.

297
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,010
Are you done? Are you kicking me
out now? Are you almost done? No,

298
00:17:21,011 --> 00:17:24,010
I've just started. Oh, you just started
it. Well, people send me a note.

299
00:17:24,011 --> 00:17:27,700
I'm 17 minutes in. Oh, Jesus. Oh, I
came up here to watch the grammys,

300
00:17:27,701 --> 00:17:31,570
but I can't turn the TV on now. Right.
It'll go watch the grammys. Okay.

301
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,433
I'm going to,

302
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,490
is it going to be a bunch of people like
right new versus about how Trump's the

303
00:17:36,491 --> 00:17:37,420
most evil thing ever.

304
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:41,650
There's some chick that showed up on
the red carpet wearing a sparkly dress.

305
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:41,950
Right.

306
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:44,560
Make America great again. And
then Trump on the back of it.

307
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:48,940
I don't know who she is, but everyone's
already like, what? Oh my God.

308
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,310
She's like, just for somebody

309
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:54,810
to show up at a Hollywood event like that
and addressed it says like, you know,

310
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:59,940
it's pro Trump is pretty pretty
paint by numbers shock, I guess.

311
00:17:59,941 --> 00:18:04,140
So. Do you think she'll get some free
press out of that? I think she will. Yeah.

312
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:07,020
Was she wearing Madonna's
baret no, she was not.

313
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm going to a protest.
What should I wear? Uh, no.

314
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:16,050
She's wearing a pro Trump approach.
Trump dress is what I'm saying. I know.

315
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,150
I know because that
other shit is played out.

316
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,340
It's acting like the sky is falling,

317
00:18:20,341 --> 00:18:22,890
so now they're going to go the
other direction. Yeah, I know,

318
00:18:22,891 --> 00:18:25,470
but I feel like that's not going
to be like good press for her.

319
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:29,210
You know what I mean? Hey, totes.
Any, any press is good. Press. Yeah.

320
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,310
Tell this dirty town works.
Yeah, I guess so. Okay.

321
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,560
Well you could just put
out a good album, right?

322
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,820
And not rely on your stupid clothes.
Yeah. If you put out a good albums,

323
00:18:38,821 --> 00:18:41,340
you can keep your clothes on. You
don't have to say who you voted for.

324
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:45,750
You can just go up there and a except
your shiny thing. That's true. All right,

325
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:50,490
I'm going to take the baby. Okay.
Okay. Bye. Okay, bye. Um, anyways.

326
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:56,550
Hi everybody. I'm glad. Yes. All right,
Chloe, if you pull the door lower,

327
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,640
it doesn't squeak as
much. See, there you go.

328
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,550
See that? No. Well, you almost did it.

329
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:10,090
You could watch the
Grammy's near go ahead.

330
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,290
Okay.

331
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:16,130
Um, anyways, oh, by the way,
I'm going to fuck this up.

332
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:21,320
The two fucking best channels
right now in my, in my, uh,

333
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:25,280
not humble opinion. Hey, people
say in my humble opinion,

334
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,410
like you're a humble person. You're not,

335
00:19:27,411 --> 00:19:32,411
you're injecting your fucking ideas
most likely into a conversation that you

336
00:19:32,691 --> 00:19:35,750
just overheard. Or is that
just me in my opinion?

337
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,740
I don't know when the humble came about,
you know, hey, you know, I'm, who am I?

338
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:43,100
Who am I? Who are you? You're the
fucking guy that is, is, you know,

339
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,520
holding court right now with your
opinions is not that fucking humble about

340
00:19:46,521 --> 00:19:50,270
this. He's shining a spotlight
on yourself. You know,

341
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:52,510
I'm actually in a good mood too.
Hang on a second. Let me meet.

342
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:55,880
Let me fucking find this stuff. Um,
there's two fucking channels out there.

343
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,470
Viceland is the shit. I already told
you about that. And now what's his face?

344
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,520
Uh, puffy. She has a new network. Puffy.

345
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,980
You can't pla fees network.

346
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,330
They said net worth revolt. It's
another great fucking channel.

347
00:20:14,331 --> 00:20:19,100
Both of those channels remind me of
the early days of MTV. The early days,

348
00:20:19,101 --> 00:20:23,570
the MTV was somewhere between, um,

349
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,830
obviously regular television and then
just basic cable fucking lunatics,

350
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,370
which I really miss. I remember
I used to watch this guy. Uh,

351
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,553
okay.

352
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,870
Damon ZX talks about this a long time
ago in the it, it'll be an Anthony show.

353
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:44,950
He used to pretend he was
running for office. Damon,

354
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,280
Zach's there. It, there it is.

355
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,730
This guy was a fucking superstar.

356
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:57,240
I think it was channel eight. There he is.

357
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,770
I love this fucking guy.

358
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,290
Oh, this is, this isn't gonna
translate. Well, d a m. O. N. Z. X.

359
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,860
N he used to do this thing where you
pretend that he was running for office,

360
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,780
this crazy makeup on and just
saying all this fucked up shit.

361
00:21:15,781 --> 00:21:19,500
And me and Bobby Kelly were
living together when stone sober,

362
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:20,940
we would just watch that guy.

363
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:22,890
Okay.

364
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,660
Like late night after we did our spots,

365
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:28,890
just ordered Chinese food and would just
sit there watching the guy laughing our

366
00:21:28,891 --> 00:21:31,800
asses off and fucking getting freaked out.

367
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,823
Um,

368
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,880
I dunno. But the early days of MTV was
like that and I haven't seen, you know,

369
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,260
network television or basic cable
be like that in a long time.

370
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:43,540
And I got to tell you
those two fucking channels,

371
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,723
um,

372
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,130
just great. A bunch of random
shit in there. Uh, original shows.

373
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,623
Um,

374
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,170
I don't know, puffy channels more
like, I just sat there watching it.

375
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,570
And was that guy a, what the fuck's
his name? Not Mike Jones guys.

376
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:06,070
Really killer Mike Killer. Mike. And
I guess the guy he raps with is white.

377
00:22:06,071 --> 00:22:08,770
I don't know anything about, but
they fucking just filled them.

378
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:12,010
They just sat around talking about
their albums. One Guy Smoking weed,

379
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,850
he has like a fucking coughing
fit for like 30 seconds.

380
00:22:15,851 --> 00:22:18,980
They don't even edit it out. I don't,

381
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,460
I was just sitting there and I'm
like two hours into this thing going,

382
00:22:21,461 --> 00:22:23,110
how the fuck am I still watching this?

383
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,380
But it's way more interesting than
a lot of, I don't know. I like it.

384
00:22:26,381 --> 00:22:28,630
Check it out if he, if he, if you
like it, you like it, whatever.

385
00:22:28,631 --> 00:22:33,010
What are you going to do? Um,
anyways. All right, let's, uh,

386
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:37,720
let's talk about the world of sports
as I always do, as I eventually do,

387
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:42,490
as I always make my way back to
the old bread and circus here. Um,

388
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,350
Bruce Cassidy, new coach of the,
uh, Boston Bruins, former player,

389
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,600
came up with the Blackhawks
in like the eighties,

390
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,550
and unfortunately had like
three or four knee injuries.

391
00:22:51,551 --> 00:22:54,400
This is all I know about
the guy. And then, um,

392
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:58,270
he paid his fucking dues
as a coach coming up.

393
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:01,960
My favorite stop that he had
on the way up, he coached for

394
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:06,430
the Jacksonville Lizard Kinks,
which, you know, I'm throwing in,

395
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,830
I'm throwing my vote and
that's one of the best, uh,

396
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:13,640
that's one of the best fucking names from
minor league team or the Lizard Kings.

397
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,980
It's a reference to the doors.

398
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,600
They've got a bunch of reptiles in Florida
and fucking Jim Morrison got arrested

399
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:24,170
in Florida for allegedly
taking his dick out.

400
00:23:24,171 --> 00:23:27,440
Also known in some circles as you lizard.

401
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:29,043
Okay.

402
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:33,000
And who doesn't want to be a king? You
know, you've got the Sacramento Kings,

403
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:37,500
you got the La kings and he got the
Jacksonville Lizard Kings. Anyways,

404
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:41,370
he's undefeated so far, you
know, granted, you know,

405
00:23:41,371 --> 00:23:44,670
we were playing our best hockey I felt
to this season when I, when he took over.

406
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:49,010
But, uh, this is a new guy, you
know, I got to a support there.

407
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:54,250
Um, what's his face? Pasa knock with
the fucking, uh, with the game where

408
00:23:56,330 --> 00:24:01,160
against the Vancouver Canucks after you
made a very sketchy past in the first

409
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,600
period. He makes it up
fucking unbelievable. K
down the fucking left side,

410
00:24:05,601 --> 00:24:09,770
slammed on the brakes, just
like I do it. Pick up hockey,

411
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:14,210
except he actually stopped rather than
continuing into the boards in hurting

412
00:24:14,211 --> 00:24:17,780
himself. Um, and then fucking little,
whatever the fuck he didn't, he put it in.

413
00:24:17,781 --> 00:24:20,750
It was fantastic. Oh,
it was tremendous. Um,

414
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:24,680
but I got to tell you guys about the
greatest sporting event I think I've been

415
00:24:24,681 --> 00:24:27,770
to since I went to the, uh,

416
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,630
New England patriots first Los Angeles
Rams when we won our first super bowl

417
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:39,160
and all I can tell you about
Duke at Cameron indoor arena.

418
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,700
It's like

419
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:47,560
how loud the crowd was when Vinod
Terry kicked that field goal.

420
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:52,430
It was that loud, the whole fucking game.

421
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,660
I've never been to anything
like it. And we sat in the low,

422
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,510
we was sitting center court. I thought
we're going to be behind the bench.

423
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:03,200
Sorry about that. We
will send a court, um,

424
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:07,760
not on the student side across from
them and the lower area. And Dude,

425
00:25:07,761 --> 00:25:09,940
I'll tell you, there's no
fucking way to get out of there.

426
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:13,970
There's no way to go to the
bathroom. There's no way to fucking,

427
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,110
there's nobody coming around
to concessions. You are
fucked. You are in there.

428
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:20,420
And that is it. Old School, fucking barn.

429
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,693
Um,

430
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:26,480
you went in, it's so small, I
guess it holds like 9,000 people,

431
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:28,760
but you felt like you were in
there with like 200 people.

432
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:33,200
And we came in and it was already a,

433
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:37,630
they were already shooting
around before the game. And uh,

434
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,990
we finally got to our seats.

435
00:25:38,991 --> 00:25:42,000
Like you just don't think that your
seats are even going to be there because

436
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:45,290
everybody is so jammed in. And um,

437
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,540
we didn't sit down for
the whole fucking game.

438
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:51,380
I guess I started sitting down during
timeouts cause I'm old and I gotta tell

439
00:25:51,381 --> 00:25:55,130
you I've never, I'd never seen
an atmosphere like that ever.

440
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:59,960
This beats everything. I've
been to the a NCAA a, uh,

441
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,310
the championship game was in the
fucking Georgia dome. So I mean,

442
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,700
that's a shitty place to watch your
basketball game. Even people going nuts.

443
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:11,870
It just floats up to the top
of the, the, the, the domain.

444
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,020
You don't even hear it.
Um, I've, I've just, I,

445
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,600
I don't even know why I
didn't know where to begin.

446
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,300
And then it was an unbelievable
gain just back and forth,

447
00:26:21,301 --> 00:26:24,270
back and forth when it looked
like UNC was going to pull away,

448
00:26:24,271 --> 00:26:25,440
Duke would come back.

449
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,680
Then it looked like Duke was going to
have the game on ice and then UNC would

450
00:26:28,681 --> 00:26:30,030
come back. Somebody hit a three,

451
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,240
someone else would hit a
fucking three was unbelievable.

452
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:37,020
And I was very impressed with both
teams. I liked that kid on UNC number 44.

453
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,640
He doesn't rattle.

454
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,630
He doesn't fucking act like he changed
the game of basketball when he hits a

455
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:44,730
shot he gave a fuck about was winning.

456
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,290
He had some big three pointer and then
they immediately called timeout rather

457
00:26:49,291 --> 00:26:52,140
than thumping his own chest and
acting like he's in Braveheart.

458
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,200
He came back to the bench
high five. But you see,

459
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,740
he was pissed because they just had just
let up an easy bucket before he hit his

460
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:03,120
three. And um, I don't know, I
don't know shit about anything,

461
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,300
but if I was a scout I would pay attention
to that just as much as somebody's

462
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:11,250
actually doing great things out on the
court. And, um, it was insane, dude.

463
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:15,960
Fucking coach k coming out. I,
I just, I'm reminded me when I,

464
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,640
when I went to the kings game,

465
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,150
when they wrapped it up one time to win
a Stanley Cup and I saw them bring the

466
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,780
Stanley Cup out. It was like that
except it could walk around talking.

467
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,190
So I want to thank, uh,

468
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:34,670
I want to thank my call at the comedy
zone in Charlotte for two awesome shows

469
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:36,630
and thank you so much for, uh,

470
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:40,380
getting us in touch with the person
that hooked us up with the tickets. Uh,

471
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,070
may verzion Barnick we're all sitting
there going, I think that might've been

472
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:45,410
okay.

473
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,940
The greatest sporting event I went to,

474
00:27:46,941 --> 00:27:50,920
obviously seeing the Patriots win
the super bowl was bigger, but um,

475
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:53,960
the level of excitement,
like I, I just never been,

476
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,500
never been to anything like that. And
uh, if you ever get a fucking chance, um,

477
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,760
that is definitely one worth stub. Hubbing

478
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,233
um,

479
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:04,801
oh,

480
00:28:04,801 --> 00:28:08,430
the college give fucking the students
were crazy and they had all these funny

481
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,040
chance and I'm sure everybody's going
to say all they stole this from you.

482
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,170
They stole this from this guy
and blah, blah blah blah blah.

483
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,130
I don't fucking know. But it
was making me laugh, you know,

484
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:20,730
when they were introduced in the
UNC players, I'll just use my name.

485
00:28:20,731 --> 00:28:21,500
They just say,

486
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,920
Ya play in fucking that point guy
number fucking zero bill burn.

487
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:30,690
And then the whole student section
just goes, hi bill, you suck.

488
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:34,140
And they just did it to the
whole thing. It was childish.

489
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:38,460
It was fucking hilarious.
They started chanting,

490
00:28:38,461 --> 00:28:41,790
I couldn't tell what they were chanting
and then gradually figured it out.

491
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:46,740
It was crazy towel guy. I was like, crazy,
what the fuck are they saying? Crazy?

492
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:50,460
What? And people start turning around
looking at us, and then I realized,

493
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:51,220
I look and be honest.

494
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,580
So we look up and all of a sudden
this fucking old guy gets up,

495
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:57,240
starts whipping this towel around his
head, this old fucking lunatic. I'm like,

496
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,600
oh, I guess that's like I
said, some crazy towel guy.

497
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,113
Right?

498
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,850
So it's gone back and
forth, back and forth,

499
00:29:04,851 --> 00:29:08,660
all these crazy chance you let your
whole team down all of this shit.

500
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:11,210
The next thing you know, it's like
halftime. We're sitting there going like,

501
00:29:11,211 --> 00:29:14,570
dude, what the fuck was that?
That was 20 minutes of basketball.

502
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,830
That felt like a minute.
My ears were ringing.

503
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,650
Like I'd gone to a concert and
there's still another half to play.

504
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:26,890
Then all of a sudden this Asian lady comes
out this Asian way coming out on like

505
00:29:27,741 --> 00:29:32,390
a fucking three story unicycle,
and she's doing that act where you,

506
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:37,130
you're fucking, you flip
the saucer Rania head. Okay.

507
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:40,370
Which I had seen before. I've seen the
act done before. I've never seen it live,

508
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,440
but it fucking hilarious. Versie
barnick had never seen that.

509
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,820
That's saying I wasn't blown away.
I was definitely blown away. So she,

510
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,970
she goes to f like flip it on
her head and the first of all,

511
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,550
you know when you stop on a
Unicycle, you can't just stop.

512
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:57,130
You gotta do that front, back,
front, back, front, back to it.

513
00:29:57,131 --> 00:29:59,980
Now she's doing that with one
foot on the fucking pedal.

514
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:04,330
She's got a goddamn
soup bowl on one of our,

515
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:08,020
the end of her feet on a toes. Your feet.
A lot of people know it as your toes,

516
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:12,730
right? So everybody's sitting
there, right? She fucking flips it.

517
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,090
It does like a triple Lindy and lands
on the top of her head and everybody's

518
00:30:16,091 --> 00:30:20,380
just like, oh shit. Right?
So then she fucking,

519
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:25,270
what the thing still on her fucking head,
the little soup kitchen. A Cup dare,

520
00:30:25,271 --> 00:30:29,710
right. She rides down to another, the
other corner of the basketball court.

521
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:34,210
Now she puts two down now for as he
starts going, no way. No fucking way.

522
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,260
No fuck away air right there,
Fred. It fucking lands. Oh crowd.

523
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,310
Oh Shit. Then she goes to do three.

524
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,100
So she's got one upright,
the other's upside down.

525
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:49,450
The others upright just going like right
up her fucking Shin and she fucking

526
00:30:49,451 --> 00:30:52,120
landed that and first z stood up.

527
00:30:53,350 --> 00:30:56,380
You have to see what black people go to
church and whether they call it catching

528
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,170
the holy ghost. That's what looked
like happened to Paul versus

529
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:05,350
everybody was sitting down
for, he stood up and applauded.

530
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:11,320
I'm fucking dying laughing. She goes
to four balls. Everybody's like,

531
00:31:11,321 --> 00:31:16,060
no shit. Four balls go in the
air. Land right on her head. One,

532
00:31:16,061 --> 00:31:20,690
two, three, four hole
crap. What the fuck? Right?

533
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:25,840
Then she goes down, her
closing bit, not one,

534
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:27,490
not two, not three or four.

535
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:31,510
She puts five fucking soup bowls.

536
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:34,960
It's all the way up to her knee.
Okay. Oh, I forgot to tell you this.

537
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,850
This guy's like flipping the bowls.

538
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:41,390
So he flipped one tour and
he fucking threw a two short.

539
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,900
She dropped it and I was going,
I fuck he just jinxed her.

540
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:45,760
He just fucked with their rhythm.

541
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,250
It's like calling a time
out to ice the kicker.

542
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,510
So she's got five flips them up in the
fucking air. One, two, three, four,

543
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,630
and the fifth one bounced off
my head. Everybody's like, ah,

544
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,860
ah Geez. There is no Santa Claus, right?

545
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:05,200
You know what she said? She said,
fuck that. Set him up again. Right?

546
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,610
Teaching these kids,

547
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,650
these fucking millennials or whatever
the fuck you call these kids nowadays,

548
00:32:11,651 --> 00:32:14,920
these kids who grew up with knee
pads, elbow pads and helmets,

549
00:32:14,921 --> 00:32:19,750
when they rode bicycles,
they had play dates.

550
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,700
They weren't left alone in the company
of adults that no one really knew who

551
00:32:24,701 --> 00:32:26,740
they were. These, these
kids were sheltered.

552
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:31,330
They don't know how to make a comeback.
These kids get drunk. They Call Uber,

553
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:34,750
right? Everything's just set up for them.

554
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:39,710
So they don't know how to fucking pull
themselves off the mat, you know? Well,

555
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,740
let me tell you something. This lady
on this one fucking tired bicycle,

556
00:32:42,741 --> 00:32:44,810
she showed them how cause
she said, hey, fuck it.

557
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,760
I don't give a shit that you throw me
five more. She sent him up again, right?

558
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:54,380
Flip them in the air. Landed all
five fucking place goes nuts.

559
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:59,000
Just as loud as the God damn.
Almost as loud as the fucking game.

560
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,530
There was no break, there was no break
in the excitement that fucking ends.

561
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,860
We're looking going, what the
fuck did we just see and outcomes,

562
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:10,700
coach k fucking Duke and
UNC and it gets loud again.

563
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:16,480
More chanting, more singing, more
fucking screaming came all the way down.

564
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:20,140
Duke finally put the game away with like
a fucking minute left with a couple of

565
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,570
foul shots. And uh,

566
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:25,510
I just sat there in the last few seconds
when I knew that Tuk was going to win

567
00:33:25,511 --> 00:33:28,690
and I just looked at, looked around,
looked at everything I could look at,

568
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:31,960
try to make enough mental
pictures as I could to take it in.

569
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:32,950
Cause I knew I was just like,

570
00:33:32,951 --> 00:33:37,300
I don't know if I'll ever get back
to seeing one of these again. But um,

571
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:42,070
I dunno if that didn't sell you,
I'd fucking, you gotta do it.

572
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,560
That is a two fuck Madison
Square Garden. It's a mecca.

573
00:33:47,561 --> 00:33:50,210
Fuck that place. You can go down
there and see the fucking ice.

574
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,180
Capades save your money.
Go on stubhub. All right,

575
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:58,870
go on stuff up and just get
yourself some tickets and go there.

576
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:02,500
You will not be disappointed. And you
gotta go while coachK is still there.

577
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,640
Who by the way,

578
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,900
I believe tomorrow the
13th is his 70th birthday.

579
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,350
Okay.

580
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,520
How great does that guy look?

581
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:16,460
Fucking guy looks like he's like maybe
a year younger, two years older than me.

582
00:34:16,461 --> 00:34:21,290
I don't know. Um, who would've thought
without, with uh, a job that's stressful.

583
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:25,280
You could still look that
good, you know? Um, anyways,

584
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,900
let me read a little bit of advertising.

587
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:39,170
there's no reason to use cheap
disposable rate to use it.

588
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:43,610
A cheap disposable razor or pay a
ridiculously high price for some gimmicky

589
00:34:43,611 --> 00:34:46,670
thing that's got a laser
pointer with 17 blades.

590

Make this choice and join dollar
shave club before dollar shave club.

591
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,340
It was either save money and get
a painful shape from a disposable,

592
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,410
like the ones that give
away for free at the gym,

593
00:34:57,411 --> 00:34:59,780
which felt like shaving with
the piece of fucking glass.

594
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Or you paid a fortune for
the latest gimmicky shave
breakthrough that you didn't

595
00:35:05,541 --> 00:35:09,890

detector or 17 blades or whatever dollar

watches, also known as movement watches.

635
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:47,060
Pronounced movement was founded on the
belief that style shouldn't break the

636
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:47,780
bank.

637
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:51,440
With the 1 million watches
sold to customers in 160
countries around the fucking

638
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:52,274
world.

639
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,980
Movement watches has solidified itself
as one of the fastest growing watches

640
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,880
companies. And let me tell you,
the owners of this company will,

641
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,440
they're personalize, have suffered
broken marriages, broken dreams,

642
00:38:03,441 --> 00:38:06,800
but God damn it, they get into
these fucking watches. Um,

643
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,570
the company started by two broke college
kids. They didn't have any money.

644
00:38:11,571 --> 00:38:14,300
And then somehow they started a company.
I've never understood that detail.

645
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,780
A wanting to wear stylish watches,
but they couldn't afford it,

646
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:19,310
so they started their own watch company.

647
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,640
This definitely sounds like
an ivy league thing. You know,

648
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,870
when I didn't have a fucking
watch and I didn't have any money,

649
00:38:24,871 --> 00:38:28,140
I just didn't wear a watch. I didn't
start a fucking watch company.

650
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,040
These Kennedys, I was, okay,

651
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:34,230
how is this like how you started
build a five shut up movement.

store at a department store,

653
00:38:38,590 --> 00:38:40,900
you're looking at four to 500
bucks. Move in watches. Okay.

654
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,970
Basically they got a great watch.

655
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,130
It's not in a department store so they
can cut out all this fucking money.

656
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,620
You know, they start at 95 bucks.

there's a piece of shit. You know?

know that. It's not like a fucking,

you know, how do we get out of
this? It's a nice watch. All right,

shows up? Are you a police officer?

706
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:49,280
Have you ever heard two people
tell you the exact same story?

707
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:53,480
This fucking guy came out of fucking
nowhere. Then you go over the other guy.

708
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,840
What happened? I came out of fucking
nowhere. I wasn't even looking.

709
00:41:58,190 --> 00:42:02,780
Never happens. It's all fake
news. It's all opinions,

710
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:03,643
right?

711
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,593
[inaudible]

712
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,130
for the most part, other than,
you know, if somebody dies,

713
00:42:07,131 --> 00:42:11,570
this guy is fucking dead. Okay.
You can agree on that. How we died,

714
00:42:11,571 --> 00:42:15,950
why he died, who's, who's responsible?
Oh, Jesus Christ. But we get it. Okay.

715
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:19,830
That's all I'm saying. That's all. That's
all I'm really saying here. All right,

716
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,100
let's get to, well, let's get to the
content here. Um, you read some, uh,

717
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,140
some of your letters here. Alright.

718
00:42:26,141 --> 00:42:31,141
Yoko Ono makes Julian Lennon by
letters he wrote to his dad at auction.

719
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,030
All right, Bill, is there a worst
woman in history? I hate to be hacky.

720
00:42:37,031 --> 00:42:41,800
I know the Beatles days were numbered.
It wasn't just her, but it didn't help.

721
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:47,730
Yeah. But at the end of the day,
John Shows her, Jesse, what happened?

722
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,620
Something happened between John and
his mom and she died or she fucking,

723
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,310
I dunno, she beat him with a wooden spoon.
I forget how the fucking story went.

724
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:01,020
All right. But whatever she did or
if she died, it's not her fault.

725
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:06,890
It left him with the psychological
makeup to be susceptible to not trying to

726
00:43:08,221 --> 00:43:09,180
just find a mate.

727
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:13,900
He also wanted a mom and all she
had to do was make some cookies.

728
00:43:14,310 --> 00:43:15,143
All right,

729
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,890
make him some cookies on his fucking
birthday, whatever the fuck he wanted,

730
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:25,740
and then that was it. This guy was
done. You know, I think he wouldn't,

731
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:26,020
you know,

732
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,400
if he lived the somewhere in his mid
forties he just would've been like,

733
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:34,930
all right. You know what? What the fuck
was that? Maybe you would've got up.

734
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:38,450
Maybe. Maybe he liked it. I have no idea.
But anyways, let's continue. He said,

735
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:39,710
then there's the video.

736
00:43:41,250 --> 00:43:44,720
Will you call her out for screeching
like a maniac during a powerful moment of

737
00:43:44,721 --> 00:43:45,210
history.

738
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:50,210
Now she won't give her husband's son
some paper he gave his dad 20 years

739
00:43:50,311 --> 00:43:53,520
earlier. This story might be a bit
old, but it doesn't seem to make,

740
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:58,000
but it doesn't make it any less
true. I watched the clip. What it is,

741
00:43:58,001 --> 00:44:02,560
was she auctioned off a bunch
of his shit is what it is.

742
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:07,090
She's not making him pay for it. She
sold it. And Julian wants to get it back,

743
00:44:07,091 --> 00:44:10,840
but because Yoko sold it, um,

744
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:13,370
he has to buy it back.

745
00:44:13,371 --> 00:44:17,990
Now I'm in defense for what I
would say is the cash cow died.

746
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:24,650
It's not like Yoko could go
out and fucking cell, take
a records like a beetle.

747
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,380
So all of a sudden she's
gone like, Holy Fuck,

748
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:30,560
how am I still going to be able
to live in the, in the Dakota?

749
00:44:30,561 --> 00:44:35,120
So she selling all this shit
or maybe her husband died.

750
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:39,210
She wanted to fucking move on and
didn't want to look at all his old shit.

751
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:43,630
You know what I mean? I
have no idea. Um, but yeah,

752
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:48,130
I watched a little, that video. Julianne
definitely goes hard on her and says,

753
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,080
uh, that you think, see, she's
extremely manipulative and that, um,

754
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,330
she knew what the fuck she
was doing from day one.

755
00:44:57,360 --> 00:45:01,730
And I can't remember if that's
actually his mother. I Dunno.

756
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,960
How was he related? It you, who
the fuck knows? I don't know. Um,

757
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:07,080
okay.

758
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,540
Is there a worse woman in history?
Yeah, there's way worse women,

759
00:45:09,541 --> 00:45:13,320
those women that ran empires
and had people killed, you know,

760
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:18,630
for whatever fucking reason. You
know, the, the, the story of Scarface,

761
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:21,550
the second one, the one
that Pachino did was based

762
00:45:23,050 --> 00:45:25,630
on a, a, you know, there
was the original movie,

763
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:30,130
but the stories that they
used in, in the second one,

764
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:31,510
uh,

765
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,510
were based on a drug dealer of
that time who actually was a woman.

766
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,100
So I mean, yeah, I would
say she was worse. You know,

767
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,130
having people shot in the fucking street
is probably worse than a sell on some

768
00:45:45,131 --> 00:45:49,780
postcards, but, you know, it's all
up to interpretation. You know,

769
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,940
this is the new me, the
new meditating bill,

770
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:56,970
the mood more relaxed bill who's undoing
the fucking nuts of anxiety in his

771
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:01,600
mind. I cannot say enough
about fucking meditating.

772
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,033
Um,

773
00:46:04,420 --> 00:46:08,080
now that I'm not trying to like get
good at it, I'm just trying to do it.

774
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:10,190
Um,

775
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:14,900
I don't flip out to the level I
used to like, I think, you know,

776
00:46:14,901 --> 00:46:19,520
say like 10 is the worst flipping
out. I think I used to walk around,

777
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,280
just walk around on a good day.

778
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:26,990
I was already at a six compared to how
most people are when they're just like

779
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:28,040
totally chilling out.

780
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:33,220
So it was a very quick and
easy trip up to 10. Uh,

781
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:37,370
now I feel like I walk around at like a
three. I feel like I've cut it in half.

782
00:46:37,371 --> 00:46:39,470
So now when I flip out
I kinda just go to six,

783
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,490
which is still totally unacceptable
for most social situations.

784
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:49,130
I still flip out and people look over
their shoulders startled but not with the

785
00:46:49,131 --> 00:46:53,210
level of, of what the
fuck, you know what I mean?

786
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,420
Reminds you this time I saw

787
00:46:58,010 --> 00:47:01,850
I was on like highway eight
or something interstate eight,

788
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:05,580
I think I was in Arizona, New Mexico.

789
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:09,300
I don't where the fuck I was
at and this bull, it somehow

790
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:12,830
gotten free. I mean I was in
the middle of fucking nowhere.

791
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:17,860
I was and there was two cowboys right
on horses and these are cowboys.

792
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,870
They're trying to fucking
rope a Goddamn bull,

793
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,910
which I didn't know if you can do. I
don't what the fuck they were doing.

794
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:27,410
So one of them is trying to distract
the bull is the other one is on a horse

795
00:47:27,411 --> 00:47:28,700
that is sneaking up behind it.

796
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:32,680
And the course is sneaking up the way
horses sneak up in a fucking cartoon.

797
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:37,300
And this bowl at the last second figured
it out and he fucking turned around.

798
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:38,081
You know that look,

799
00:47:38,081 --> 00:47:41,020
Bruce Willis always does when he
looks over his shoulder and die hard.

800
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:45,610
It's the same thing except it was a
fucking bull. That's the look that people,

801
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:50,110
when I would lose my shit prior to
meditating, I would get that look.

802
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:53,230
Everyone would fucking turn
around. Like, you know,

803
00:47:54,130 --> 00:47:58,660
a skyscraper was on fire and it was just
some fucking balding redhead flipping

804
00:47:58,661 --> 00:48:01,330
out because he couldn't figure out
the new operating system on his,

805
00:48:01,331 --> 00:48:02,260
on his smart phone.

806
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,140
Okay.

807
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:07,540
Completely unacceptable.
So, uh, my temper is,

808
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,920
has really reduced and, um,

809
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,280
I'm telling you, if I
could just not fucking do,

810
00:48:14,281 --> 00:48:16,040
I just made this statement
out loud. It's like, I'm,

811
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:19,140
my daughter's not going to
see me flipping out, you know,

812
00:48:19,141 --> 00:48:21,510
I'm not saying I want it every way.
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey. Would,

813
00:48:21,511 --> 00:48:24,630
she's fucking drawn on the
wall at some point, but, uh,

814
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:27,390
she's not going to see me yelling at
computers. It's just not going to happen.

815
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:30,690
Okay. And I say it out loud. When I
say it out loud, that means it happens.

816
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:35,770
Right? I hope so many ways. I'm
trying. Fuck you guys. I'm trying.

817
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:37,600
Anytime I talk about this
too in my standup back,

818
00:48:37,601 --> 00:48:40,690
then I'm going to try to fix my
temper. People just start laughing.

819
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:45,160
They laugh when they point and
they make me feel bad. I'm alright.

820
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,470
Italy and the European Union.
Hey, their Capitol Hill Bill.

821
00:48:50,471 --> 00:48:52,420
I'm just a bill. Yes.

822
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:57,421
I'm only a bill and I'm sitting
here on Capitol Hill and okay.

823
00:48:58,241 --> 00:49:02,320
I'm a political science professor from
a school I won't name to keep with your

824
00:49:02,321 --> 00:49:07,300
policy of not naming names a having
studied and taught the subject.

825
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:12,250
It's fair to say I look at what goes
on today from a much wider scope.

826
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,260
A wider scope than who? Me. I would
hope so. I would hope so wider than me.

827
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:18,971
Um, all right.

828
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:22,930
And that's not something that is only
exclusive to receiving a master's in

829
00:49:22,931 --> 00:49:26,710
political science. Could you pat
yourself on the back any more? Sir?

830
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:28,870
Did you elbow patch?

831
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,900
Fly off your fucking left arm of your
sport coat when you reach back to that is

832
00:49:36,731 --> 00:49:37,450
all,

833
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:41,560
I love this guy and that's not all these
something that is only exclusive to

834
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,380
receiving a master's in political science.

835
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,240
This guy should be wearing a scarf with
a nice breeze going. Anyone can read

836
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:51,913
souls in each sin.

837
00:49:52,890 --> 00:49:56,610
Thank you for fucking sound spelling
that for me and others who have honestly

838
00:49:56,611 --> 00:50:00,660
captured an important perspective
of history and have a much clearer

839
00:50:00,661 --> 00:50:04,410
understanding of how and why governments
and socialites have evolved through

840
00:50:04,411 --> 00:50:07,060
history. Anyways,

841
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:10,780
there is one thing that has flown under
the radar now that I've gotten my resume

842
00:50:10,781 --> 00:50:11,580
out of the way.

843
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:16,580
There's one thing that has flown under
the radar and I think it should scare the

844
00:50:16,721 --> 00:50:20,290
shit out of most European
countries. All right.

845
00:50:20,291 --> 00:50:24,610
Let me start by saying in short
that the European Union parentheses,

846
00:50:24,611 --> 00:50:28,370
which in my opinion is run
by fascist self interest,

847
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:32,780
can I just stop here and say this is
the most well-written fucking email I've

848
00:50:32,781 --> 00:50:34,430
ever received on the podcast.

849
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:36,260
Okay.

850
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:40,580
This is incredible. Um, let me start by
saying in short to the European Union,

851
00:50:40,581 --> 00:50:43,130
which my opinion is run by
fascist with self interest,

852
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:47,660
tried to take control of Italy's
army for the sake of your time.

853
00:50:47,690 --> 00:50:49,370
I will spoil the ending.

854
00:50:49,910 --> 00:50:54,910
Italy did not vote to allow the EU
to take over that move by the EU.

855
00:50:55,311 --> 00:51:00,311
Alarmed some of my peers who I in 20
plus years of knowing them have not seen

856
00:51:01,881 --> 00:51:05,660
them alarmed by anything in terms of
government, in the scheme of things,

857
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:07,010
a banking institution,

858
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,040
openly financing legislation that is
trying to gain control of a foreign

859
00:51:12,681 --> 00:51:16,940
countries, foreign governments. Military
is for the lack of a better term,

860
00:51:16,941 --> 00:51:21,530
really, really ballsy. Why do I feel
like I missed some information here?

861
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:28,050
Okay, so the, the European Union
tried to take over Italy's army. Okay.

862
00:51:28,051 --> 00:51:33,051
I see that Italy did not vote
to allow the EU to take over.

863
00:51:35,530 --> 00:51:39,820
So when you joined the European Union,

864
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,660
they took take over your army,
is that what you're saying? Okay,

865
00:51:43,661 --> 00:51:47,590
so that moved by the EU
alarm. Some of my peers.

866
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:53,310
What move? Oh, trying
to take over the, okay,

867
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:55,730
but you're jumping back and forth here.
I can't tell what you're talking about.

868
00:51:55,900 --> 00:51:57,530
Can take control of Italy's army case.

869
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:01,070
So them trying to take control of their
army. Yeah. How would you do that?

870
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:05,000
Okay. The idea that,
let me just finish this,

871
00:52:05,001 --> 00:52:08,930
the idea that certain globalist groups
are trying to take control of the world

872
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:14,380
is not an incredible idea among people
who are versed in political economics or

873
00:52:14,481 --> 00:52:16,400
conspiracy theorists like myself.

874
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:20,300
But you know something
me, they just go, oh,

875
00:52:20,301 --> 00:52:24,680
where do you get your
fucking 10 hat on? And a you,

876
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:26,720
if you just started saying
what the fuck you just said,

877
00:52:26,990 --> 00:52:28,730
you'd probably run into the
same problem like you just,

878
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:32,510
I just said it was the best written
email ever and I got lost in it cause I'm

879
00:52:32,511 --> 00:52:34,490
too fucking stupid. I understand
what you're talking about.

880
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:36,650
So it's gotta be hard, man.

881
00:52:36,651 --> 00:52:39,290
You just got to hang out with people
with the fucking elbow patches on their

882
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:42,320
sport coats. Right. Anyways.

883
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,620
The idea that certain globalist groups
are trying to take control of the world

884
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:48,830
is not an incredible idea among people
who are versed in political economics.

885
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:53,570
I have heard you talk about stuff like
this in the context of a conspiracy and

886
00:52:53,571 --> 00:52:58,400
so other than this possibly possibly
being interesting to you. It's also too,

887
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,220
it's also affirm that you
are not out of your mind.

888
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,220
I attached an article if
you'd like to read further,

889
00:53:04,221 --> 00:53:07,950
absolutely would look at this. How about
that? Everybody all you can't stand.

890
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:11,870
I got a 10 hat on tinfoil hat
on. Whatever the fuck that means.

891
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,180
Half of you say that you
don't even know what it means.

892
00:53:14,181 --> 00:53:17,700
You get your tinfoil
tinfoil add on. You know,

893
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:21,360
I don't even know what the fuck it
means. Is that, is that like my antenna?

894
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:22,950
If I'm doing some sort of pirate radio,

895
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,210
tin foil hat meaning I know what it means.

896
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,330
Weed you out of your fucking
mind, but how did it come about?

897
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:33,690
The tinfoil hat is made from one
or more sheets of aluminum foil.

898
00:53:34,260 --> 00:53:39,260
I didn't want the exact or a piece of
conventional head gear lined with foil

899
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:43,230
worn in the belief or hope that it
shields the brain from threats such as

900
00:53:43,231 --> 00:53:47,340
electromagnetic fields, mind
control in mind. Right. Oh, I see.

901
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:51,960
I see. Well, you know,
that's a macgyver shit.

902
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:57,920
I can go with that. Right. Set
a bad thing. Anyways. Well,

903
00:53:57,921 --> 00:53:58,754
where the fuck was I?

904
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:01,990
Um,

905
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:04,810
I've attached a, I wouldn't, I would
actually to relate to how long is this?

906
00:54:04,811 --> 00:54:07,870
So is this something I can read? You know,

907
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,420
I'll read about this and I'll
give you my uninformed opinion,

908
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:14,800
my moronic opinion on the next podcast.
How about that? Does that work for you?

909
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:17,320
Does that grab you? I'm all right.

910
00:54:17,321 --> 00:54:21,070
Fat guys turns out to not be fat.

911
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,140
Billy twinkle Bowes. Um, this guy told,

912
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:27,760
was told by a doctor his
whole life that he was fat.

913
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:33,010
He had this huge frontal thing on going
on that turned out to not be a giant

914
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:35,110
belly, but 130 pound tumor.

915
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:39,280
How many people do you know will
start using the tumor defense?

916
00:54:40,690 --> 00:54:41,800
MMM [inaudible]

917
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:46,310
I actually looked this fucking thing
up. The guy is fat. He's very fat.

918
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,840
Even after the fucking tumor.

919
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:53,120
I mean like he's laying in bed,

920
00:54:54,210 --> 00:54:57,340
any has, it's like he is an inner
tube of fat going around the like,

921
00:54:57,360 --> 00:55:01,560
that's what his neck is.
This guy is so fucking fat.

922
00:55:01,561 --> 00:55:04,980
He had a 130 pound tumor and he just
thought it was part of his love handle.

923
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:10,750
He is fat. Um, I'm glad they got
it out of there. Geez. How do you,

924
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,190
I didn't get that out of
their hundred and 30 pounds.

925
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:18,150
How the fuck do you, I mean, you
gotta take it out in sections

926
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,010
10 pounds at a time. You need
to make 13 fucking incisions,

927
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:27,400
Jesus Christ and just thrown
it over your shoulder,

928
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:29,890
hitting the ground like
a fucking bowling ball.

929
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:33,253
Yeah.

930
00:55:34,590 --> 00:55:36,360
Jesus Christ. Do you know, I knew a guy

931
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,913
dead. Um,

932
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:39,921
you know,

933
00:55:39,921 --> 00:55:43,850
everybody's talking about probiotics
and they talk about the bacteria in your

934
00:55:43,851 --> 00:55:46,100
gut that it will, you know,

935
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,740
there's bacteria in your gut
that's supposed to be there.

936
00:55:48,770 --> 00:55:51,350
They try to scare the shit out of
you, but it's supposed to be there.

937
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:56,540
It's there for when you die in a begins
to did decomposing process provided

938
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,640
you're not full of fucking preservatives
and you just decompose because you not

939
00:56:01,641 --> 00:56:04,010
important and you just become
part of the earth again.

940
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:08,660
But we stick ups ourselves in these fancy
fucking boxes because we think we're

941
00:56:08,661 --> 00:56:12,520
too good to be warm food for whatever
fucking reason. But anyways, um,

942
00:56:12,830 --> 00:56:13,820
alcohol,

943
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:15,520
okay,

944
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:18,940
eats away at the good shit, the good
bacteria that you need while you're alive.

945
00:56:18,941 --> 00:56:22,330
Like you supposed to be balanced and
you're supposed to have more of the good

946
00:56:22,331 --> 00:56:25,030
bacteria cause you have
more of the bad bacteria,

947
00:56:25,031 --> 00:56:27,070
you can actually enter
your own fucking way.

948
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,910
You beginning to decompose while you're
still alive or in a short way you

949
00:56:30,911 --> 00:56:32,950
starting to die. This is the
way this guy explained it to me.

950
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,320
So he started getting a distended belly.

951
00:56:35,321 --> 00:56:37,810
They didn't know what the fuck was going
on and he wouldn't go to the doctor.

952
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,460
And then finally you found out, you know,

953
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:42,220
somebody said maybe you got a tape worn
and that freaked them the fuck out.

954
00:56:42,790 --> 00:56:44,190
They could've been something alive in him.

955
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,500
And he went to the doctor and then
they found out that that's what it was.

956
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:51,340
And uh, they gave him some
medicine and you know,

957
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:55,750
Eddie had to shit it all out. That's
basically what happens. So, um,

958
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:59,260
I don't know. Even then I always buy
the Greek yogurt and it goes bad.

959
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:00,551
I always think like,

960
00:57:00,551 --> 00:57:04,000
and I'll slam a couple of scotches and
the next morning I have two spoonfuls of

961
00:57:04,001 --> 00:57:07,840
fucking Greek yogurt yoga and I'll be
fine. I was happy in the life insurance,

962
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:11,230
they said on a nice fucking
easy, you know, heart rhythm.

963
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,280
I was also meditating when they did it.
You know, I was being totally present.

964
00:57:15,281 --> 00:57:19,000
I was listening to the sounds of
the room. I slowed my breathing,

965
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:22,960
I tricked those fuckers. But I also had
the Bruins game on in the background.

966
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,030
So I was trying not to react
to what the fuck was going on.

967
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:28,480
Cause we'd left his fucking cunty goal
at the end of the second period with like

968
00:57:28,481 --> 00:57:32,440
one second left. All
right. Crazy. Sadam story.

969
00:57:33,640 --> 00:57:35,470
Crazy. Alright. Hey,

970
00:57:35,471 --> 00:57:39,490
bill thought I brighten your day with
this crazy account of what went down in

971
00:57:39,491 --> 00:57:41,260
Iraq. When Sadam took power,

972
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:44,590
basically the gathered all
government officials in one room,

973
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:49,120
the current military leader gets
brought out on stage. He clearly,

974
00:57:49,121 --> 00:57:53,410
he's clearly been beaten. He
admits to having committed treason,

975
00:57:53,650 --> 00:57:57,790
but clearly he hasn't. They then start
calling out officials one at a time,

976
00:57:57,791 --> 00:58:02,350
so everyone was scared
shitless that they'd be called
out and marched out into a

977
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:06,100
courtyard with the others. Then
after half of them were gone,

978
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:10,870
the remaining officials were all taken
out to the courtyard and told that if

979
00:58:10,871 --> 00:58:13,390
they didn't shoot the traders,

980
00:58:14,990 --> 00:58:16,970
they and their families would be killed.

981
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:21,050
That way they all had blood
on their hands. Insane.

982
00:58:21,710 --> 00:58:26,710
Here's the whole account and did think
that u s still did business with Saddam,

983
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:30,350
with them after that. Ha
Ha Dude. As far as I know,

984
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:32,150
we kind of put that guy in over there,

985
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:34,583
you know

986
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:36,620
it,

987
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:41,520
and we were cool with the guy until he
fucking tried to go around us and start

988
00:58:41,521 --> 00:58:45,030
selling oil. The other, I don't know
what the fuck he did. We, you know,

989
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:50,110
you know what I mean? Saddam
was saying to the United States,

990
00:58:50,111 --> 00:58:54,490
he was like one of those fucking a first
round draft choices that that's a bust.

991
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:58,270
He was a bust for us, you know, in
a very promising college career.

992
00:58:59,230 --> 00:59:02,440
And you know, he just, he just
didn't have the passion. Actually.

993
00:59:02,441 --> 00:59:05,020
He was a very passionate guy. He
just wasn't passionate in the wrong,

994
00:59:05,990 --> 00:59:09,610
I don't know who the fuck knows.
I mean it's all evil shit.

995
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,440
That shit is just like,

996
00:59:13,010 --> 00:59:13,843
um,

997
00:59:14,970 --> 00:59:17,820
it's the most base level evil cause
they're not even trying to hide it.

998
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,670
But I got to tell you, when Trump
was talking to that fucking guy,

999
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,040
they're on from Fox News,

1000
00:59:22,700 --> 00:59:26,300
Bill O'Reilly and Bill O'Reilly's
giving him shit that he was friends with

1001
00:59:26,301 --> 00:59:28,910
Putin, Putin or whatever the
fuck his name is. And he goes,

1002
00:59:28,911 --> 00:59:33,740
the guys that he's a killer to have
a fucking standing president go,

1003
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,410
well look at this country. Look
what we'll look what we've done.

1004
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,310
My jaw hit the fucking ground. Like,
is he actually going to say this?

1005
00:59:40,311 --> 00:59:41,960
You can't say this.
Everybody knows it's true.

1006
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:45,080
But you can't fucking say this now.

1007
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,860
We only kill the bad
people. The Fuck Outta here.

1008
00:59:48,890 --> 00:59:52,550
It's all fucking evil. And that
goes back to that fake news.

1009
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:55,580
That's why they need to take control
of the fake news so they can spin it.

1010
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,820
You know what I mean? The Guy,
he came out of fucking nowhere.

1011
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:02,990
The sedan was saying, where
are we at? A green light.

1012
01:00:02,991 --> 01:00:07,520
He came out of fucking nowhere.
Everybody does it. Everybody does it.

1013
01:00:07,550 --> 01:00:11,330
You know what? And I fucking do
it too. We're all spinning it.

1014
01:00:11,540 --> 01:00:15,100
We're all spinning our own horse
shit. We all think we're Fike.

1015
01:00:15,110 --> 01:00:17,900
I'm not going to speak for you guys,
but I'm spinning my own bullshit, right?

1016
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:22,670
This is my favorite video anybody's
sent me in a long fucking time now. Oh,

1017
01:00:22,671 --> 01:00:25,340
by the way, if you want to watch
that sit down thing, uh, I'll,

1018
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:28,730
I'll post all these videos. I don't
know if I want to watch it. That stuff.

1019
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,650
I Dunno. I don't like
watching shit like that.

1020
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,600
Um,

1021
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:36,120
all right. 109 year old guy
smoked cigars and drinks whiskey.

1022
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:41,250
Dear Billy F deer farm state bill. I know
you have a life insurance policy test,

1023
01:00:41,251 --> 01:00:42,900
but I thought you might want to see this.

1024
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:47,160
This 109 year old guy smoked cigars all
day. Not Saying it's great for everyone,

1025
01:00:47,161 --> 01:00:51,510
but figured you'd want to hear the title.
Actually marginalize this guy's life.

1026
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:54,150
He's got a great
attitude. He still drives.

1027
01:00:54,151 --> 01:00:58,170
He's the oldest living World War II
veteran. You'd really enjoy this.

1028
01:00:58,171 --> 01:01:02,670
He talks about having a truck for a long
time and they show his old school TV

1029
01:01:02,671 --> 01:01:06,270
with the giant dials. He keeps it
all because it works and he likes it.

1030
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:08,520
Come to Boston. I fucking love this guy.

1031
01:01:10,110 --> 01:01:14,400
He said at one point he smokes 12
cigars a day. He goes, I don't inhale.

1032
01:01:15,510 --> 01:01:18,000
So you inhale, he goes, you get in
trouble. The bottom line is, you know,

1033
01:01:18,430 --> 01:01:21,300
whatever's genetics are, this works for
him. Cause I know if I smoked 12 a day,

1034
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:24,970
I, first of all, I couldn't
physically fucking do it, but he had,

1035
01:01:25,100 --> 01:01:28,830
it's like a 79 look like a
78 or 79 Ford pickup truck,

1036
01:01:29,670 --> 01:01:33,450
yet an old square TV that still had
the legs on it from like the 70s.

1037
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:35,290
Um,

1038
01:01:35,290 --> 01:01:39,160
he built his house in like 1940.
He still lives there. He said,

1039
01:01:39,250 --> 01:01:42,850
I like the shit that I have. It still
works so I'm not buying more shit.

1040
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,130
It's like what I'm trying to do now,

1041
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,080
get rid of all this
extra shit that I bought

1042
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:48,773
and um,

1043
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:50,891
I got to tell you,

1044
01:01:50,891 --> 01:01:55,891
watching this guy watching his life is
the life that I'm slowly moving towards.

1045
01:01:57,100 --> 01:01:58,690
It's the life that I want.

1046
01:02:00,290 --> 01:02:01,110
Um,

1047
01:02:01,110 --> 01:02:04,440
after running around
like a fucking lunatic,

1048
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,460
reacting to everything for
the first fucking, you know,

1049
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:11,460
40 something years of my life.

1050
01:02:13,340 --> 01:02:14,173
Um,

1051
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:20,100
you know, I would like to slow down a
little bit is far as of, I mean, look,

1052
01:02:20,101 --> 01:02:22,770
I'm still, I know all you guys are
worried. I got God, he's gonna slow down.

1053
01:02:22,771 --> 01:02:26,130
He's not going to be fucking far. I'm
still going to completely fuck up,

1054
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:29,220
still going to do dumb
shit. I'm going to be fine,

1055
01:02:29,221 --> 01:02:32,310
but I don't have to be walking
or I basically walked around,

1056
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:38,090
stuck in fight or flight mode probably
from the age of eight till now.

1057
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:44,050
And um, I dunno,

1058
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,460
it's just stupid with stats.

1059
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:49,600
It's funny to observe but it really
wears on the people around you and

1060
01:02:49,601 --> 01:02:51,400
eventually it fucking wears you down.

1061
01:02:51,430 --> 01:02:56,430
And it's just like the amount of fucking
time that I have wasted arguing with

1062
01:02:56,771 --> 01:02:58,810
people where they're not
going to change their mind.

1063
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,790
I'm not going to change my mind. I've
just, I, I've, uh, I've done, uh,

1064
01:03:03,791 --> 01:03:06,670
past that point my fucking life
and it feels fucking great.

1065
01:03:07,300 --> 01:03:08,890
I just have to believe that I am.

1066
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:11,133
Um,

1067
01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:13,880
I'm trying to do now when I flip up,

1068
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:16,310
cause I know there's other
angry constantly listen
to this and you listen to

1069
01:03:16,311 --> 01:03:17,650
this because I'm an angry conduit.

1070
01:03:17,690 --> 01:03:19,400
It probably makes you feel
better about yourself.

1071
01:03:20,870 --> 01:03:21,310
Um,

1072
01:03:21,310 --> 01:03:24,130
which is why I love Bobby Knight bought
you watch Bobby night and you're like,

1073
01:03:24,131 --> 01:03:27,370
oh my God, I'm a fucking saint. This guy.

1074
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,780
Now this guy has got a temper that
I'm telling you right now. Yeah.

1075
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,580
Your wife ever gives you
shit for having a temper.

1076
01:03:31,581 --> 01:03:32,800
It's like you think I got a temper,

1077
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,930
just cut the yard or you
could be married to that.

1078
01:03:37,060 --> 01:03:41,650
And I love Bobby Knight by
the way. Um, so anyways,

1079
01:03:42,130 --> 01:03:45,670
uh, I just now like, uh,

1080
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,230
I don't know. I try to, in the
moment I just try to fucking like,

1081
01:03:51,231 --> 01:03:54,680
this is funny thing that happens.
Like when my daughter, uh,

1082
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:57,860
you don't need your diaper
changed. It's like, you know,

1083
01:03:57,920 --> 01:04:00,620
you hear him farting and everything.
So you thinking like, okay,

1084
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,130
that's definitely a, you
know, when you, you, I mean,

1085
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:05,960
without getting into the gross details,

1086
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:11,480
just think you here the farm and you
think that's the gun sounding the end of

1087
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:13,880
the game. And then when she get into it,

1088
01:04:13,881 --> 01:04:17,660
you realize that wasn't the gun sounding
the end of the game or even the end of

1089
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:21,050
the half. That was the sound of the
fucking jets flying over the game,

1090
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:24,230
over the stadium right after
the fucking national anthem.

1091
01:04:24,231 --> 01:04:25,640
And the game's about ready to begin.

1092
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:28,033
Um,

1093
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:32,250
I left pad save yesterday,
block cheese block,

1094
01:04:33,350 --> 01:04:37,740
saved my wall, took it all on my
shirt and all that. It's just like,

1095
01:04:39,090 --> 01:04:39,923
okay,

1096
01:04:39,950 --> 01:04:42,320
it's fucking unbelievable.
And whenever that happens,

1097
01:04:42,321 --> 01:04:45,660
like a couple of times I went like,
Nia, she, why'd you tell me to come in?

1098
01:04:45,661 --> 01:04:46,610
And she's still going.

1099
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:52,120
Like she could tell like there's any way
for my wife to know whether my daughter

1100
01:04:52,701 --> 01:04:57,500
is done going to the bathroom or
not. She's got no fucking idea.

1101
01:04:57,501 --> 01:05:00,980
And I just, I apologized, eh, uh,

1102
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,080
I just addressed that I was angry and I,

1103
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:06,830
and I did it two more fucking
times and now, now I got it down.

1104
01:05:07,490 --> 01:05:11,420
Now he just say something as I walk up
to the changing table at three or four in

1105
01:05:11,421 --> 01:05:16,190
the morning. And I just basically
say, if she's not done, and you know,

1106
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:20,560
this is not anybody's fault, this is
just part of having a kid don't flip out.

1107
01:05:20,561 --> 01:05:23,800
And I, and I'll see how that works for
me tonight. That's just based. I just,

1108
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:29,050
before I just kept it all in my
head and then it becomes like,

1109
01:05:29,051 --> 01:05:31,480
it isn't that it's Sorta,
sorta real but isn't,

1110
01:05:31,810 --> 01:05:35,500
I just find when I say it out loud,
then I can fucking address it and uh,

1111
01:05:36,010 --> 01:05:38,880
so we'll see that. But uh, I gotta tell
you, I actually fucking really enjoy,

1112
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:41,230
uh, changing diapers and everything.

1113
01:05:41,231 --> 01:05:44,710
We gave my daughter her first bath
ever right in the kitchen sink,

1114
01:05:44,711 --> 01:05:45,790
old school style.

1115
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:51,220
I'm sure we were supposed to have like
a fucking hazmat suit team come in and

1116
01:05:51,221 --> 01:05:54,790
disinfect the sink and she's supposed
to wear a helmet and some scuba gear,

1117
01:05:55,450 --> 01:05:59,050
but uh, that's not our bringing her up.
We'll go and we'll go on old school.

1118
01:05:59,051 --> 01:06:00,970
I've been playing music
for, on everything.

1119
01:06:01,610 --> 01:06:04,720
Got this exercise ball and really just
kind of puts you to sleep and I just play

1120
01:06:04,721 --> 01:06:06,850
music and she just totally chills out.

1121
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:08,863
Um,

1122
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:12,930
the stuff that she's enjoyed so far,
she's, she likes Herbie Hancock.

1123
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:18,540
I was playing some Billy carbons, some
of this shit I just been listening to.

1124
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:21,223
Um,

1125
01:06:22,390 --> 01:06:25,210
what else has she been listed? Some
of the pop stuff she really likes.

1126
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:28,480
I think they just liked music in general.
They just kind of like, what the,

1127
01:06:28,481 --> 01:06:32,590
what is that? And uh, I dunno,
it's getting to that point.

1128
01:06:32,591 --> 01:06:35,170
She's just starting to be able to look
around and you kind of sit there going

1129
01:06:35,171 --> 01:06:35,381

kind of drift away and look at something

1133
01:06:44,771 --> 01:06:48,360
else. I'm like, Eh, I guess I'm still
like an acid trip when she looks at me.

1134
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:50,643
Um,

1135
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:53,090

a great time and I,

1136
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:57,610

Fucking broke kid trying to pay off
student loans. And then you have a kid,

1143
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:22,090
people in their twenties, if they
complain about having a kid, I, I, yeah,
