00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.890
So now let's see how write-update and
write-invalidate differ from each other.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.624
Suppose that we have two cores and
the program where core 0 writes to A and

00:00:10.624 --> 00:00:16.110
then core 1 reads from A, and
this repeats a thousand times.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.210
And you can assume that the caches
are empty before all of this.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.770
And that we don't care what
happens after all of this.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.270
The question for you is, how many bus
uses do we get with a write-update

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.880
protocol that uses both the shared and
the dirty bit optimization?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.470
Put your answer here.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.120
And then with a write-invalidate
protocol with the same shared and

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.830
dirty bits, put your answer here.
