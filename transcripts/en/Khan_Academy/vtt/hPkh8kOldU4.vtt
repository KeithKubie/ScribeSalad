00:00:00.737 --> 00:00:02.071
Voiceover: What I want to do in this video

00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:04.471
is start introducing and
we've already talked about him

00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.138
a little bit.

00:00:05.138 --> 00:00:06.737
So actually they've
already been introduced,

00:00:06.737 --> 00:00:09.737
but maybe flesh out a little
bit more Keynesian thinking.

00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:12.294
This right here is a picture
of John Maynard Keynes

00:00:12.294 --> 00:00:14.138
and I often mispronounce him as Keynes,

00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:15.138
because that's how it's spelled,

00:00:15.138 --> 00:00:17.471
but it's John Maynard Keynes.

00:00:17.471 --> 00:00:18.876
He was an economist who did a lot

00:00:18.876 --> 00:00:21.804
of his most famous work
during the Great Depression,

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:24.877
because in his view,
classical models did not seem

00:00:24.877 --> 00:00:28.210
to be of much use during
the Great Depression.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.543
To understand this a little bit better,

00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:34.804
let's compare purely
classical aggregate supply

00:00:34.804 --> 00:00:37.806
aggregate demand models to maybe one

00:00:37.806 --> 00:00:38.805
that's more Keynesian.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.404
Some of what we've talked about -

00:00:40.404 --> 00:00:41.210
Keynesian, I should say.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.404
I already did my first mispronunciation.

00:00:43.404 --> 00:00:46.005
One that's a little bit more Keynesian.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:48.270
Keynesian right over here.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.337
In some of the conversations,
we've already begun

00:00:50.337 --> 00:00:52.637
to introduce a little bit
of Keynesian thinking,

00:00:52.637 --> 00:00:53.734
but in this video we're going to try

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:56.406
to show the difference between the two

00:00:56.406 --> 00:00:58.403
and it's not to say that one
is right or one is wrong.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:00.737
In fact, Keynesian felt
that in the long run,

00:01:00.737 --> 00:01:02.805
the classical model actually made sense,

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:04.403
but he also famously said,

00:01:04.403 --> 00:01:06.604
"In the long run we are all dead."

00:01:06.604 --> 00:01:08.604
I also want to emphasize
that this isn't a defense

00:01:08.604 --> 00:01:10.018
of Keynesian economics.

00:01:10.018 --> 00:01:12.473
There are some points
to what he has to say,

00:01:12.473 --> 00:01:13.684
but there are other schools of thought.

00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:15.686
Unfortunately, they
often get very dogmatic,

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:18.020
but they also have some reasons to be wary

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.937
of Keynesian economics
and we hope to go over

00:01:19.937 --> 00:01:22.355
some of that in future videos.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:23.604
In this one, we just want to understand

00:01:23.604 --> 00:01:25.604
what Keynesian economics is all about

00:01:25.604 --> 00:01:27.770
and how it really was
a fundamental departure

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.674
from classical economics.

00:01:29.674 --> 00:01:31.535
In classical economics, I'm going to use

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:35.103
aggregate demand and
aggregate supply in both.

00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:38.538
This is classical, this is
price, this right over here

00:01:38.538 --> 00:01:42.020
is real GDP and I'm going to do it

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.871
for the Keynesian case, as well.

00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:50.105
This is price and this
right over here is real GDP.

00:01:51.601 --> 00:01:55.870
In both views of reality, or both models,

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.104
you have a downward sloping
aggregate demand curve

00:01:58.104 --> 00:01:59.538
for all the reasons
that we've talked about

00:01:59.538 --> 00:02:01.604
in multiple videos.

00:02:01.604 --> 00:02:05.937
That's aggregate demand right over there.

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.538
We've already seen it,
the classical view is that

00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:14.105
in the long run, an
economy's productivity,

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:17.536
or productive capacity,
or its output shouldn't

00:02:17.536 --> 00:02:19.736
be dependent on prices.

00:02:19.736 --> 00:02:22.203
We've seen the long run
aggregate supply curve

00:02:22.203 --> 00:02:23.536
something like this.

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:26.805
This is the aggregate
supply in the long run,

00:02:26.805 --> 00:02:30.537
or sometimes you'll have
long run aggregate supply.

00:02:30.537 --> 00:02:32.437
Sometimes it'll be referred to that.

00:02:32.437 --> 00:02:35.886
Saying, look, all prices
are, they're a way to signal

00:02:35.886 --> 00:02:37.803
what people want and demand
and things like that,

00:02:37.803 --> 00:02:39.870
but at the end of the
day, prices and money,

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.804
they're just facilitating transactions.

00:02:41.804 --> 00:02:44.070
You go to work and you
get paid and all that,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.870
but then you go and use
that money to go and buy

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.870
other things that the economy produces,

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.538
like food and shelter and transportation.

00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.537
All money is is a way of
facilitating the transactions,

00:02:53.537 --> 00:02:55.870
but the economy, in theory,
based on how many people

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.469
it has, what kind of technology it has,

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:01.019
what kind of factories it has,

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.536
what kind of natural resources
it has, it's just going

00:03:03.536 --> 00:03:05.602
to produce what it's going to produce.

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:08.203
If you were to just
change aggregate demand,

00:03:08.203 --> 00:03:12.019
if the government were to print money

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.138
and aggregate demand were to -

00:03:14.138 --> 00:03:15.871
and just distribute it from helicopters,

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:18.269
in this classical model,
you would just have

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.437
aggregate demand shift to
the right, but you have

00:03:20.437 --> 00:03:22.924
this vertical long run
aggregate supply curve

00:03:22.924 --> 00:03:25.122
so the net effect is it
didn't change the output

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.318
in this classical model.

00:03:26.318 --> 00:03:28.117
All that happens is that the price goes

00:03:28.117 --> 00:03:30.784
from this equilibrium price
to this equilibrium price

00:03:30.784 --> 00:03:31.783
over here.

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:33.605
You have the price would go up

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:35.855
and you would just experience inflation

00:03:35.855 --> 00:03:38.938
with no increased output
and there's multiple ways

00:03:38.938 --> 00:03:40.717
you could've shifted that
aggregate demand curve

00:03:40.717 --> 00:03:41.450
to the right.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.272
You could have a fiscal
policy where the government,

00:03:44.272 --> 00:03:47.051
maybe it holds its tax revenue constant,

00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:50.938
but it increases spending, or it goes

00:03:50.938 --> 00:03:51.985
the other way around.

00:03:51.985 --> 00:03:55.688
It does not decrease, it
doesn't change its spending,

00:03:55.688 --> 00:03:56.937
but it lowers tax revenue.

00:03:56.937 --> 00:03:59.188
Either of those, it tries to
pump money into the economy

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:01.520
and pushes that aggregate
demand curve to the right.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.783
In this purely classical
view, it says in the long run,

00:04:03.783 --> 00:04:06.604
that's not going to be any good,
just will lead to inflation.

00:04:06.604 --> 00:04:08.783
The only way that you
can increase the output

00:04:08.783 --> 00:04:11.650
of economy is by making
it more productive.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.604
Maybe making some
investments in technology,

00:04:14.604 --> 00:04:16.022
make the economy more efficient,

00:04:16.022 --> 00:04:18.522
maybe your population grows.

00:04:18.522 --> 00:04:21.522
The only way is to really
shift this curve to the right

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:26.984
on the supply side right over here.

00:04:26.984 --> 00:04:29.450
Keynes did not disagree with
that, but he sitting here

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.191
in the middle of the
Great Depression, saying,

00:04:31.191 --> 00:04:34.920
"Look, all of a sudden
people are poor in the 1930s.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.917
"Factories did not get blown
up, people didn't disappear.

00:04:37.917 --> 00:04:40.022
"In fact, there are
factories that want to run,

00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:41.938
but they are being shut
down, because no one

00:04:41.938 --> 00:04:42.982
"is demanding goods from them.

00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:44.718
"There are people who
want to work, but no one

00:04:44.718 --> 00:04:46.272
"is asking them to work.

00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:48.188
"They could work and produce
wealth that could then

00:04:48.188 --> 00:04:49.270
"be distributed to -

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.272
"But no one's demanding
for them to do it."

00:04:52.272 --> 00:04:55.117
He suspected something weird was happening

00:04:55.117 --> 00:04:58.850
with aggregate demand,
especially in the short run.

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.522
In a very pure, very,
very short run model,

00:05:01.522 --> 00:05:04.856
I know we have talked about a short run

00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.520
aggregate supply curve
that is upward sloping.

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.450
Something that might
look something like that.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.916
That is actually starting to put some

00:05:12.916 --> 00:05:15.452
of the Keynesian ideas into practice.

00:05:15.452 --> 00:05:18.385
What I like to think of
is something in between,

00:05:18.385 --> 00:05:21.056
but if you think in the
very, very, very short term,

00:05:21.056 --> 00:05:23.702
Keynes would say prices are
going to be very sticky.

00:05:23.702 --> 00:05:28.654
Especially in the short
run, and I'll call it

00:05:28.654 --> 00:05:32.388
the very short run, you have,

00:05:32.388 --> 00:05:36.786
especially if the economy's
producing well below

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:38.785
its capacity, like it seemed to be doing

00:05:38.785 --> 00:05:44.721
during the Great Depression,
prices are sticky.

00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:46.458
That makes intuitive sense.

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:48.210
If the economy's trying to get overheated,

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.626
people are being overworked, you want them

00:05:49.626 --> 00:05:51.460
to work more, hey, I want overtime.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.326
You want factories to operate
faster, people are going

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:54.059
to start -

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:56.544
The utilization is high, people
are going to start charging

00:05:56.544 --> 00:05:59.326
more and more, but if I'm
unemployed and I'm desperate

00:05:59.326 --> 00:06:01.794
to work, I'm not going
to ask for a pay raise.

00:06:01.794 --> 00:06:04.725
If my factory is at 30%
utilization and someone wants

00:06:04.725 --> 00:06:06.876
to buy a little bit more, that's
not the time that I'm going

00:06:06.876 --> 00:06:08.460
to say, "Hey, I'm going
to raise prices on you."

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.292
I'll say, "Yeah, exact same price.

00:06:10.292 --> 00:06:12.662
"You want another 5% of
my factory to be utilized?

00:06:12.662 --> 00:06:14.376
"Sure, that sounds great."

00:06:14.376 --> 00:06:16.794
In the very short run,
it has the opposite view

00:06:16.794 --> 00:06:19.595
of the aggregate supply curve
than the classical model.

00:06:19.595 --> 00:06:23.482
It says at any level of
GDP in the short run,

00:06:23.482 --> 00:06:25.669
prices won't be affected.

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:27.203
It won't be affected.

00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:30.702
So in this model right over
here, this is aggregate supply

00:06:30.702 --> 00:06:34.620
I'll call it, in the very short run.

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.952
You can debate what short
run or very short run means,

00:06:37.952 --> 00:06:39.803
whether we're talking
about days, weeks, months,

00:06:39.803 --> 00:06:42.786
or even a few years here,
but once you start looking

00:06:42.786 --> 00:06:44.402
at the world this way,

00:06:44.402 --> 00:06:45.736
then something interesting happens.

00:06:45.736 --> 00:06:48.203
In this model right over
here, the only way to increase

00:06:48.203 --> 00:06:51.868
GDP was on the supply side.

00:06:51.868 --> 00:06:54.738
In this model right over
here, the only way to increase

00:06:54.738 --> 00:06:58.369
GDP is on the demand
side, to actually either

00:06:58.369 --> 00:07:01.005
through monetary policy, print more money,

00:07:01.005 --> 00:07:04.725
or through fiscal policy, lower taxes

00:07:04.725 --> 00:07:09.131
while holding spending
constant or maybe do both,

00:07:09.131 --> 00:07:10.657
essentially deficit spending.

00:07:10.657 --> 00:07:12.923
Someway, without holding taxes constant,

00:07:12.923 --> 00:07:14.925
but the government's
spending more, whatever.

00:07:14.925 --> 00:07:20.057
Shift the curve to the right
and that might be a way

00:07:20.057 --> 00:07:24.324
to increase the overall output.

00:07:24.324 --> 00:07:26.858
Keynes' real realization was that, look,

00:07:26.858 --> 00:07:28.857
the classical economist
would tell you if you have

00:07:28.857 --> 00:07:32.124
a free and unfettered market,
the economy will just get

00:07:32.124 --> 00:07:34.754
to its natural, very efficient state.

00:07:34.754 --> 00:07:36.670
Keynes says, "Yes, that is sometimes true,

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:38.754
"but that's sometimes not true."

00:07:38.754 --> 00:07:40.091
We'll talk about different cases.

00:07:40.091 --> 00:07:41.857
By no means do I think the Keynesian model

00:07:41.857 --> 00:07:43.587
is the ideal and I don't think even Keynes

00:07:43.587 --> 00:07:45.191
would have thought the Keynesian model

00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.457
describes everything.

00:07:46.457 --> 00:07:48.458
Depends on the circumstance.

00:07:48.458 --> 00:07:49.587
Keynes would say, "Look, let's think

00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:52.724
"of a very simple idea."

00:07:52.724 --> 00:07:57.255
You have person A, person
B, person C, and person D.

00:07:57.255 --> 00:08:01.004
Let's say person A sells
to person B, person B sells

00:08:01.004 --> 00:08:04.125
to person C, person C sells to person D,

00:08:04.125 --> 00:08:06.323
and person D sells to person A.

00:08:06.323 --> 00:08:08.392
Let's say that they're
all selling two units

00:08:08.392 --> 00:08:11.592
of whatever good and
service that they offer.

00:08:11.592 --> 00:08:16.004
For whatever reason, let's
say C, all of a sudden,

00:08:16.004 --> 00:08:18.124
just got a little bit
pessimistic, had a bad dream,

00:08:18.124 --> 00:08:19.586
woke up on the wrong
side of the bed and says,

00:08:19.586 --> 00:08:20.670
"You know what?

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.920
"I'm not feeling so
good about the economy.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.192
"I'm going to hold off
from my purchase from B.

00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:27.086
Instead of two units, I'm
going to purchase one unit.

00:08:27.086 --> 00:08:30.524
Well, B says, "Well,
gee, my business is bad.

00:08:30.524 --> 00:08:33.170
"Now I'm only going to purchase one unit."

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.170
A does the same thing for the same reason,

00:08:35.170 --> 00:08:36.392
D does the same thing.

00:08:36.392 --> 00:08:38.839
Now it all came back to C and now C says,

00:08:38.839 --> 00:08:41.198
"Wow, I was right, that
dream was predictive."

00:08:41.198 --> 00:08:43.170
It was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

00:08:43.170 --> 00:08:45.004
Now they're going to operate in this state

00:08:45.004 --> 00:08:46.858
and there might not be any
natural way to get them

00:08:46.858 --> 00:08:49.658
bumped up to that state
where they're all buying

00:08:49.658 --> 00:08:53.671
two units from each other
without maybe some outside,

00:08:53.671 --> 00:08:54.924
especially some government act

00:08:54.924 --> 00:08:56.253
or maybe all of a sudden saying,

00:08:56.253 --> 00:08:58.340
"Hey B, if C doesn't want
to buy two, I'm going

00:08:58.340 --> 00:08:59.588
"to buy two temporarily."

00:08:59.588 --> 00:09:01.254
There are dangers to this, huge dangers,

00:09:01.254 --> 00:09:03.190
and we'll talk about
that in future videos,

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.524
but then someone else,
let's say the government,

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:07.203
tries to shift the aggregate demand curve

00:09:07.203 --> 00:09:08.592
through fiscal policy and they say,

00:09:08.592 --> 00:09:12.063
"Hey, I'll buy one from you, B."

00:09:12.063 --> 00:09:14.327
Then B says, "Okay, now
I can buy two again,"

00:09:14.327 --> 00:09:17.994
and A can buy two again and
then D can buy two again

00:09:17.994 --> 00:09:19.365
and then C can buy two again.

00:09:19.365 --> 00:09:21.060
Then in an ideal world,
and this is the danger

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.793
of the government, the
government would step back

00:09:22.793 --> 00:09:24.729
and say, "Okay, everything is fine again.

00:09:24.729 --> 00:09:26.279
"I don't have to buy this."

00:09:26.279 --> 00:09:28.615
As we know, it's very
hard once the government

00:09:28.615 --> 00:09:31.029
starts spending money in
some way, to actually cut

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:33.065
this spending right over here.

00:09:33.065 --> 00:09:36.531
This was the general
idea behind the Keynesian

00:09:36.531 --> 00:09:37.531
versus the classical.

00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:39.460
He says, "Look, there are circumstances,

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:41.595
"like the Great Depression,
where the economy

00:09:41.595 --> 00:09:44.192
"is operating well below its potential

00:09:44.192 --> 00:09:46.865
"and in those circumstances,
you need to have

00:09:46.865 --> 00:09:50.930
"a stimulus on the demand
side, not just a supply side."

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.779
The correct answer, as with all things,

00:09:52.779 --> 00:09:54.726
is probably something in between.

00:09:54.726 --> 00:09:58.207
A probably more accurate
model is something like this.

00:09:58.207 --> 00:09:59.939
Let's draw ...

00:09:59.939 --> 00:10:05.933
This is price, this is
real GDP right over here

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:08.017
and we'll still draw our downward sloping

00:10:08.017 --> 00:10:12.267
aggregate demand curve and
the more accurate thing

00:10:12.267 --> 00:10:14.019
might look something like this.

00:10:14.019 --> 00:10:15.790
Let's say that this is the absolute

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:19.117
theoretical maximum output,
if everyone in the country

00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:20.906
isn't sleeping, the
factories are just being run

00:10:20.906 --> 00:10:23.739
to the ground, that's the
absolute theoretical output.

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:25.918
Let's say that this is its potential.

00:10:25.918 --> 00:10:28.115
Just a healthy state where the economy

00:10:28.115 --> 00:10:29.490
might be operating.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:33.582
The real medium run
supply curve or short run

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:35.654
aggregate supply curve.

00:10:35.654 --> 00:10:38.851
This is aggregate supply
in the very long run.

00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:41.582
This is the long run aggregate supply.

00:10:41.582 --> 00:10:44.051
The best model would be
something that's in between

00:10:44.051 --> 00:10:45.990
and might look something like this.

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:48.322
Our aggregate supply curve
might look something like -

00:10:48.322 --> 00:10:50.330
I want to do it in a different color.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.740
Let me do it in magenta.

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.850
It might look something like this.

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.115
For whatever reason, maybe
someone has a bad dream

00:11:00.115 --> 00:11:01.795
or a bunch of people have a bad dream

00:11:01.795 --> 00:11:04.490
or something scary
happens, aggregate demand -

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.517
The stock market crashes,
something happens,

00:11:06.517 --> 00:11:09.050
aggregate demand shifts over there.

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.321
When we're out here, now all of a sudden

00:11:11.321 --> 00:11:13.914
our output is well below
potential, we have a lot

00:11:13.914 --> 00:11:16.916
of excess capacity and now
the Keynesian ideas seem

00:11:16.916 --> 00:11:17.917
maybe they'll make sense.

00:11:17.917 --> 00:11:18.914
Maybe there should be

00:11:18.914 --> 00:11:21.000
some outside stimulus happening.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.740
On the other side, if we're
performing well at potential,

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:26.250
then all of a sudden the
government wants to do

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.201
Keynesian policies and
we'll see in future videos,

00:11:28.201 --> 00:11:29.164
the government will always want

00:11:29.164 --> 00:11:31.582
to do Keynesian policies,
even if they're not justified.

00:11:31.582 --> 00:11:36.248
It will push aggregate demand out here

00:11:36.248 --> 00:11:37.657
and then the net effect is,

00:11:37.657 --> 00:11:39.450
especially the more
vertical this is, the more

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:41.989
this net effect will be true,
that you really just get

00:11:41.989 --> 00:11:44.186
more inflation and you
don't really get a lot

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:45.914
of increase in output.

00:11:45.914 --> 00:11:48.017
It really depends on the circumstance,

00:11:48.017 --> 00:11:50.715
but an aggregate supply
curve that starts flat

00:11:50.715 --> 00:11:53.585
at low levels of output
and then gets higher

00:11:53.585 --> 00:11:55.654
and higher slope and
becomes almost vertical

00:11:55.654 --> 00:11:57.849
in your high levels of
output, this is probably

00:11:57.849 --> 00:12:00.572
a better model that
takes into consideration

00:12:00.572 --> 00:12:04.133
both the classical and
the Keynesian ideas.
