that we disagree with

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680

where people should be protected is

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500
where people should be protected is
 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.609
where people should be protected is
through assets and you know the contract

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619
through assets and you know the contract
 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.980
through assets and you know the contract
yes yeah I think that that all makes

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990
yes yeah I think that that all makes
 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.260
yes yeah I think that that all makes
sense to me that all that still in terms

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270
sense to me that all that still in terms
 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.689
sense to me that all that still in terms
of like alimony and child support and

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699
of like alimony and child support and
 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:24.859
of like alimony and child support and
all those things make sense to me and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
all those things make sense to me and
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.929
all those things make sense to me and
that and the idea that the community

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939
that and the idea that the community
 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.120
that and the idea that the community
reinforces it which would then become

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130
reinforces it which would then become
 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.500
reinforces it which would then become
the government reinforce and all that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510
the government reinforce and all that
 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.700
the government reinforce and all that
stuff that all makes sense to me I

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710
stuff that all makes sense to me I
 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.780
stuff that all makes sense to me I
understand it but why do you care if two

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790
understand it but why do you care if two
 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690
understand it but why do you care if two
gay guys want to get married um so from

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700
gay guys want to get married um so from
 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.459
gay guys want to get married um so from
a religious point of view sure let's go

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
a religious point of view sure let's go
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.130
a religious point of view sure let's go
for it so so I mean why would a secular

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140
for it so so I mean why would a secular
 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.619
for it so so I mean why would a secular
point of view first so the the idea is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629
point of view first so the the idea is
 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.299
point of view first so the the idea is
not that I care deeply whether two gay

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
not that I care deeply whether two gay
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.560
not that I care deeply whether two gay
guys want to get married to each other

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359
view on this and I think this is
 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.969
view on this and I think this is
actually just the general conservative

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979
actually just the general conservative
 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.320
actually just the general conservative

point of view on human action generally
 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.289
point of view on human action generally
is I don't know meaning that for the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299
is I don't know meaning that for the
 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.460
is I don't know meaning that for the
vast majority of people out assume that

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470
vast majority of people out assume that
 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.469
vast majority of people out assume that
they have a biological drive to engage

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
they have a biological drive to engage
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.140
they have a biological drive to engage
in that behavior but the traditional

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
in that behavior but the traditional
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.260
in that behavior but the traditional
sort of will point of view is that

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:17.270
sort of will point of view is that
 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.399
sort of will point of view is that
biological drive does not necessarily

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
biological drive does not necessarily
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.170
biological drive does not necessarily
match up to the activity you ought to

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180
match up to the activity you ought to
 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420
match up to the activity you ought to
engage in right men for example have a

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.740
engage in right men for example have a
biological drive to impregnate many

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
biological drive to impregnate many
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.130
biological drive to impregnate many
women

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140
women
 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.749
women
that's not something religion is cool

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759
that's not something religion is cool
 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.840
that's not something religion is cool
with either right so the the idea is

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850
with either right so the the idea is
 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359
with either right so the the idea is
that rapid religion is cool with the man

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369
that rapid religion is cool with the man
 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.520
that rapid religion is cool with the man
being with one woman and impregnating

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530
being with one woman and impregnating
 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.010
being with one woman and impregnating
her but you're not cool with a man being

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020
her but you're not cool with a man being
 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.380
her but you're not cool with a man being
with a man so I can give you the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390
with a man so I can give you the
 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.819
with a man so I can give you the
religious explanation I think we the

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829
religious explanation I think we the
 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.289
religious explanation I think we the
second what explanation so they said the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299
second what explanation so they said the
 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.630
second what explanation so they said the
religious explanation is that there is

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640
religious explanation is that there is
 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.210
religious explanation is that there is
something different about a woman than

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
something different about a woman than
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.920
something different about a woman than
there is about a man and a man is made

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930
there is about a man and a man is made
 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.109
there is about a man and a man is made
better through his union with a woman

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
better through his union with a woman
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.230
better through his union with a woman
and that if you pervert the sex drive to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240
and that if you pervert the sex drive to
 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.499
and that if you pervert the sex drive to
pursue your pleasure instead of a

pursue your pleasure instead of a
lasting relationship upon which the

lasting relationship upon which the
 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.760
lasting relationship upon which the
basis of society is built then you are

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190
in and argue against that you would say
 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.520
in and argue against that you would say
that just because someone can't get

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530
that just because someone can't get
 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.170
that just because someone can't get
pregnant doesn't mean that they don't

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
pregnant doesn't mean that they don't
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.130
pregnant doesn't mean that they don't
have

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.110
have
a loving relationship that contributes

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120
a loving relationship that contributes
 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.059
a loving relationship that contributes
to society well that's true but it is

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069
to society well that's true but it is
 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.340
to society well that's true but it is
also foregoing the more productive

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350
also foregoing the more productive
 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.920
also foregoing the more productive
relationship of being able to bear and

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930
relationship of being able to bear and
 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.780
relationship of being able to bear and
we're children and also recognizing

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790
we're children and also recognizing
 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.430
we're children and also recognizing
they're not different right and and

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
they're not different right and and
 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.930
they're not different right and and
recognizing also the sexes are not the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940
recognizing also the sexes are not the
 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540
recognizing also the sexes are not the
same so the you know being with a man is

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550
same so the you know being with a man is
 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.370
same so the you know being with a man is
in a relationship different than being

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380
in a relationship different than being
 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.780
in a relationship different than being
with a woman I would assume I mean I

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790
with a woman I would assume I mean I
 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.400
with a woman I would assume I mean I
think that's why gay guys are gay if it

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410
think that's why gay guys are gay if it
 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.050
think that's why gay guys are gay if it
weren't then assume that they would be

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
weren't then assume that they would be
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.490
weren't then assume that they would be
fine with being with a woman right so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
fine with being with a woman right so
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.550
fine with being with a woman right so
that's so that relationship from a from

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560
that's so that relationship from a from
 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.710
that's so that relationship from a from
a religious perspective is more valuable

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
a religious perspective is more valuable
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.940
a religious perspective is more valuable
because women have different qualities

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950
because women have different qualities
 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.170
because women have different qualities
than men you round off each other's

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180
than men you round off each other's
 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.210
than men you round off each other's
harsh edges it changes you I mean you're

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220
harsh edges it changes you I mean you're
 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.509
harsh edges it changes you I mean you're

married
 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.160
married
being married changes a man in a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170
being married changes a man in a
 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.390
being married changes a man in a
different way that being married to a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
different way that being married to a
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.130
different way that being married to a
member the same sex would right but I

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590
if you're a mediator they're not forcing
 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.229
if you're a mediator they're not forcing
anybody right but I want them to have

question that I've always found actually

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.260
question that I've always found actually
 

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.380
question that I've always found actually
not particularly interesting simply

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.390
not particularly interesting simply
 

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.320
not particularly interesting simply
because it doesn't take into account the

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:21.330

where it brings me back to this like is
 

00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:32.300
where it brings me back to this like is
it possible that these laws in this

00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:32.310
it possible that these laws in this
 

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.370

right
 

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.760
right
but clearly written by people well the

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:38.770

God but again that doesn't the logic
 

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.700
God but again that doesn't the logic
