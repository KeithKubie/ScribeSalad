00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.660
SPEAKER: Welcome, everybody,
to one more Talks at Google.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.770
Today's edition
is NASA at Google.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:20.730
Thanks to our little NASA at
Ames Research Center Relation

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.230
Group.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.870
Wave, guys.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:27.380
Today's guest is
Ms. Dava Newman.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.570
She's the Deputy Administrator
of the National Aerospace

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.740
Agency.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.510
I was watching yesterday
a documentary on YouTube.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.680
I was preparing myself for
this talk knowing that Dava

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.770
has worked on space suits.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.330
And I was thinking, having
followed the space program

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.460
for many years and having a lot
of knowledge about the Apollo

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.240
program-- well, what were
the most challenging things

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.790
to solve?

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.330
And I've read many books.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.020
I read a book about how
the KSC was put together--

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.350
the Kennedy Space Center.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.090
It was a huge
logistical nightmare.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.370
I read a book
about the Crawler--

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.690
how difficult it was
to solve that problem.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.530
It was first thought, oh,
we'll do it with barges.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.120
Then somebody saw this big
equipment moving earth--

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.340
actually, coal.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.990
Someone said, maybe
we should try that.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.130
Guidance to the moon--
that was solved at MIT.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100
That was a huge
challenge, as well.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.640
Although, it had some roots, at
least, in World War II efforts.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.820
But the thing that
I think were truly

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.320
the challenges are the thing
that gets the rocket up,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.050
which is the rocket engine.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.320
And after all, it is
called rocket science.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.080
But if you look today,
I think we pretty much

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.730
nailed that problem.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.340
On the space shuttle
program we have now,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.030
we had our rockets
that can throttle,

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.400
that can change the impulse.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.390
But the other piece
that I thought

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.010
was really remarkable and very,
very hard was the space suit.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.419
And it's completely
unappreciated.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.860
It's like, hey, it's
just a suit, right?

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.680
It's like we have
divers and whatnot.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.910
But when you read about
it-- there's books out.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.620
There's actually a talk
also on Google Talks

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.890
about the space suit itself.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.900
There's also
documentaries out there.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.260
It makes the difference.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.240
It makes a complete
difference in a program.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.370
What's the point of
sending humans to the moon

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.440
or sending humans
to Mars if you're

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.510
going to keep them
in a tin can--

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.850
if they can't do what
humans do, like walk around

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.390
and do things the
way humans do it?

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.400
So watch that on YouTube.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.380
I'm going to go with the
introduction to Dava Newman.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680
But this is truly
something that she has

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.010
contributed at NASA, as well.

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.030
So Dr. David Newman was
nominated by President Barack

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.350
Obama in January
2015 and confirmed

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.880
by the US Senate in April
2015 to serve as the Deputy

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.560
Administrator of the National
Aeronautics and Space

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960
Administration.

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.140
Prior to her tenure
with NASA, Newman

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.130
was the Apollo program
professor of Aeronautics

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.390
at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, MIT,

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.660
in Cambridge.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.700
Ms. Newman's expertise is in
multidisciplinary research

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.120
encompassing aerospace,
biomedical engineering.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.770
Her latest research efforts
included advanced space suit

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.620
design, dynamics and
control of astronaut motion,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.980
sociotechnical systems
analysis and space policy,

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.330
also ongoing efforts in assisted
and wearable technologies

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:43.380
to augment human
locomotion here on Earth.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.210
David Newman is the author
of "Interactive Aerospace

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.340
Engineering and Design,"
an introductory engineering

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.980
textbook published by
McGraw-Hill in 2002.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.070
She has also published more
than 250 papers and journals

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.890
and referred conferences.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.690
She has served on numerous
national academy studies

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.530
and panels on human spaceflight,
human robotic interaction,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.280
and active learning
for engineering,

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.020
and design, and education.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.460
Please join me in welcoming
Dava Newman to Google.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.960
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.750
DAVA NEWMAN: Thank you.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.850
Thank you very much.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:14.420
Thank you.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.336
It's great to be here.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.240
Hello, everyone.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.750
Good morning-- or afternoon.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.250
Thank you for coming.

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.720
So we'd just like
to share our vision

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.600
for the future of
human space exploration

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.430
as well as leave
a lot of questions

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.620
for Q&amp;A. I'm joined today
with NASA Ames colleagues.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.560
Dr. Eugene Tu, the
director, is here.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.910
And Terry Fong is here.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.870
And we have seven-- on my
count-- seven partnerships

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:45.760
right now with Google and NASA.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.880
And so we're really glad to work
with you and partner with you.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.780
And we're always
better together.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.677
And as I say, it's
kind of the new NASA.

00:04:52.677 --> 00:04:54.510
Since I've been in
government the last year,

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.840
it's been my privilege
and pleasure.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.790
But we're just asking how
can we partner creatively?

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.170
How can we get things done?

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.140
And this is all about, really,
for me, the human spirit,

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.420
and exploration, and
raising ourselves--

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.890
see what potential do
we have as humanity.

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.400
And I think it's making
people interplanetary.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.270
So with that, tell you some
highlights-- highlights

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.920
in the last year.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.720
It's the 26th
anniversary of Hubble.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.160
So everyone in here 26 or
younger, raise your hand.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.390
It's a lot of you guys.

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:25.190
Fantastic.

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.920
Your entire life, the
Hubble Space Telescope,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.410
or the world's greatest
optical telescope observatory,

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:32.790
has been up there.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.290
And it's only in
low Earth orbit.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.415
But we've looked back
13 billion light years.

00:05:39.415 --> 00:05:40.915
So these are our
enduring questions.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.950
Are there other
habitable planets?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:48.870
Is there life out there?

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.550
And then was there
past life ever on Mars?

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.070
So my favorite
story about Hubble

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.520
is there was a really
dark spot in the sky.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.620
And we had never seen it, right?

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.490
So put up your thumbs.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:00.995
A thumbnail.

00:06:00.995 --> 00:06:01.620
Your thumbnail.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:04.250
We looked at that really
dark spot in the sky.

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.484
Does anyone know what we found?

00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:07.275
AUDIENCE: Galaxies.

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:07.740
DAVA NEWMAN: Hm?

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.670
AUDIENCE: Galaxies.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:09.586
DAVA NEWMAN: Galaxies.

00:06:09.586 --> 00:06:11.650
3000 new galaxies.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:12.792
So just amazing.

00:06:12.792 --> 00:06:13.750
Really, actually, hard.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.791
I think I'm pretty good
with orders of magnitude.

00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:17.330
But that just blows my mind.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.930
And so celebrating Hubble--
it's a really great--

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.650
there's many more.

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.900
It's James Webb or JWST--
it's NASA's acronyms.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.900
You guys have a lot of
Google acronyms, as well.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.890
So James Webb is going
to launch in 2018.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.090
It's 100 times more
powerful, Dr. Mather--

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:37.830
that's our Nobel
laureate-- tells me.

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.920
He's the PI.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.070
18 really amazing, adaptive.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.010
Now, this is infrared.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.800
So this is an
infrared telescope.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.830
And its purpose
is, again, help us

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.340
with these enduring questions.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.430
Dark energy.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:54.340
Dark matter.

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.100
What's 96% of the stuff
that we don't know?

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.820
So looking again for the
beginnings and the origins

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:03.270
of the solar system.

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:06.350
So again, James
Webb coming at you

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.340
and launching on an Ariane 5.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.280
Again, look at our
international partnerships.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.030
Lots of international science
on board that we welcome-- we

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.530
seek.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:17.613
How many of you know about
new horizons last year?

00:07:17.613 --> 00:07:18.310
Thank you.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:19.270
Pluto.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.090
I count dwarf planets.

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:22.570
I'm an aerospace engineer.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:24.590
So we didn't know
what it looked like.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:25.160
It was fuzzy.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.100
We had never seen it.

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.070
We have never been there.

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:30.870
Pretty amazing to
zoom in on Pluto.

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:31.570
It has a heart.

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.580
I like that part.

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:35.140
I got to tweet it
for Valentines.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:36.080
Just amazing.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:38.120
So now, we know what
it's made out of-- icy.

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.480
And who knew Pluto would have
mountains and this structure?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.760
Anyone heard about
our Dawn spacecraft?

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.570
It's wonderful.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.300
Just won the Collier Trophy.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.600
We're so proud of this team.

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:51.860
So Dawn-- it's orbiting another
dwarf planet called Ceres.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.830
It's in between Mars,
Jupiter in the asteroid belt.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.082
And it's been twinkling at us.

00:07:56.082 --> 00:07:58.040
And we didn't know what
those shiny spots were,

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.530
so we zoomed in on it.

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:02.760
And we actually just-- looks
like there's some deposits--

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.780
some sodium deposits.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:06.900
We've really zoomed in on
it in just last December.

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.510
That's Ahuna Mons.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.410
Move over Mt.

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:09.990
Everest.

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:14.390
Ahuna Mons is 5 kilometers
tall, 20 kilometers wide.

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:15.690
And we see some reflections.

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:18.340
And we see these reflections--
these high intensity

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.830
reflections coming
at us from Ceres--

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:23.960
and, again, maybe sodium
and other deposits

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.790
that we're seeing.

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:26.490
But really amazing.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:28.750
Who would have thought
that there would ever

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:32.909
be this type of mountain
on Ceres-- not us

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:34.960
when we started the mission.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:37.450
So exploring the solar
system and beyond

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:40.440
is what we're all
about with our probes.

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.980
Where will you be
on 4th of July?

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:43.880
Here?

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.619
Big fireworks in the
Bay Area-- hope so.

00:08:45.619 --> 00:08:47.410
Well, we're really
happy because everyone's

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:49.365
throwing a big party for us.

00:08:49.365 --> 00:08:50.740
We're glad for
all the fireworks.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:53.070
We get to Jupiter on July 4th.

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.930
Good timing, huh?

00:08:53.930 --> 00:08:56.300
We go into our-- we're
inserting our orbit.

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.350
It's-- gosh, you
know, it was 18 days.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.820
18 days and counting.

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.240
So we've been going since 2011.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:06.680
But we'll get to our closest
point in the orbit July 4th.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.640
And just an amazing mission.

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.350
It's the largest
most complicated

00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:14.910
solar powered probe ever to
go into the solar system.

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.110
So this is really off the grid.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.150
It's way out there.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.700
And one of my favorite
things about it is JunoCam.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:22.862
Sends back HD images.

00:09:22.862 --> 00:09:24.070
And we're saying, hey, world.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.882
It's our largest effort to
date in citizen science.

00:09:26.882 --> 00:09:28.090
Where do you want to explore?

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:29.750
Tell us where to point JunoCam.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.560
You tell us.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:32.860
So we're really trying to
bring the world with us--

00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:35.860
to bring all of you with
us into exploration.

00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:38.120
And so that's just
really exciting.

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.910
OSIRIS-REx.

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:40.490
Anyone heard of OREx?

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.870
It's the first time we're
going-- no one's heard of OREx?

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:43.870
What are you guys doing?

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.410
Working too hard here at Google?

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:45.910
Come on.

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:47.530
Get on our website.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:48.680
It's pretty amazing.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.740
We're going to an
asteroid-- Bennu.

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.860
And we will launch in September.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:57.780
And it, of course, takes a few
years to do the whole mission.

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.790
I think in 2023, we
get the sample back.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:04.270
But it'll be our first
asteroid sample return.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.460
Great mission.

00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:08.746
Since you guys-- you Googlers
been working so hard,

00:10:08.746 --> 00:10:10.120
what about flowing
water on Mars?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.810
You know this happened?

00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.210
There you go.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:14.067
Huge.

00:10:14.067 --> 00:10:14.900
Scientifically huge.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.780
We knew there was ice
on the polar caps,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.380
but water-- seasonal water.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.440
So we're studying this.

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.000
We're looking,
again, this season.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.640
And watch this.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.230
Mars has 1% carbon
dioxide atmosphere.

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.580
So what happened to
Mars's atmosphere?

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.010
We've been wondering about
that for a long time.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:39.110
We have five Landers and
Orbiters at Mars today.

00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:41.601
And this one's from Maven.

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:44.620
A simulation.

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:45.420
Solar winds.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.580
These are the solar winds.

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.520
And this is literally the ions
being ablated off of Mars.

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.440
Mars has no global magnetic
field, unlucky for Mars,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.570
real lucky for Earth.

00:10:58.570 --> 00:11:05.720
Our magnetic shield is really
important-- so in real time.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.730
But the papers are
just being written now

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.200
about Mars's atmosphere and what
could have happened to Mars.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:14.150
Why are we so
fascinated with Mars?

00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:16.890
Mars and Earth-- 4.5
billion years old each.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:18.680
Sister planets.

00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.980
Mars is really far away.

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.740
It's really hard to get to.

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:25.260
And we've been doing this
for 50 years with Landers

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:26.060
and Orbiters.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:30.420
But again, now, we perhaps know
the evidence of maybe how Mars

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:31.920
lost its atmosphere
because we think

00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.800
3.5 billion years ago,
Mars was wet, wonderful,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.540
could have harbored life.

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.350
And then what went
so terribly wrong?

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:42.990
That's really important
for us to learn for Earth.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.920
All of our exploring,
I'd like to say,

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.820
just teaches us about
Spaceship Earth.

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:50.420
Earth is my number one planet.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.890
Mars is my second
favorite planet.

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:55.200
But make no mistake
about our home planet

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.370
and Spaceship Earth.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:11:59.040
So gosh-- anyone
here 16 or under?

00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.550
I got all the 26 years old.

00:12:00.550 --> 00:12:01.090
OK.

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:01.770
Exactly.

00:12:01.770 --> 00:12:04.470
You guys are really smart
high school interns.

00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:07.560
So for their entire life-- and
I call them the Mars generation.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:09.867
The young-- the folks in
college and high school today,

00:12:09.867 --> 00:12:11.700
they are our Mars
generation because they're

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:13.890
the ones who are going to
be the explorers of Mars.

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:14.860
But 16 years.

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:17.229
So this is phase one
of our journey to Mars,

00:12:17.229 --> 00:12:18.520
which I'll tell you more about.

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.510
But 16 years-- international.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:23.480
We're working with 15 other
countries, five major partners.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.020
Amazing.

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:28.620
How many of you know
about our big rocket?

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:29.900
A few.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:31.370
This is not just
for PowerPoints.

00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.610
Take a look.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:33.220
It's serious.

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:34.944
And it's being well
constructed today.

00:12:34.944 --> 00:12:35.610
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.930
This is a fun video.

00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:38.640
It's SLS, our Space
Launch System.

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.860
This gets us beyond
low earth orbit.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.500
First to lunar orbit,
deep space, in the 2020s.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.890
And then 2030s, onward to Mars.

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.370
We're investing 1,000 companies
across every state in the US

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:54.160
to get this done.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:58.650
It's the coolest stir
friction welding machine ever.

00:12:58.650 --> 00:13:01.650
That's our Michoud
assembly building

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:02.895
just out of New Orleans.

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:08.820
That's animation, but
we've been testing--

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.800
this is the animation part.

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.415
But the rocket's real.

00:13:12.415 --> 00:13:13.540
These are the real engines.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:15.390
We've been firing
them ad testing them.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.990
That's at our
Stennis Space Center

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:25.100
to test-- do the static fairs.

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:27.450
The solids have
been tested in Utah.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.244
Has the Orion capsule on top.

00:13:36.119 --> 00:13:37.160
That's the Orion capsule.

00:13:41.092 --> 00:13:43.300
European support module ring
around it, you just saw.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.354
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:59.130 --> 00:14:00.780
Entry, descent, and landing.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.170
That's a tough problem.

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.425
That's a huge, huge
challenge for us--

00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.733
well, for a human mission.

00:14:11.915 --> 00:14:13.540
That's a good day in
the office, right?

00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.331
We drop things out of
planes and test them.

00:14:15.331 --> 00:14:16.720
A lot of sensors.

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.930
So that's what we call,
EM-1, Exploration Mission 1.

00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:35.513
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:35.513 --> 00:14:37.165
And 2018, we'll launch.

00:14:37.165 --> 00:14:40.210
It'll be followed shortly
by EM-2, Exploration Mission

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:42.630
2, which will be the first
one with astronauts on board.

00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:45.000
EM-1 has the Orion Capsule.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.570
And then second mission has
the astronauts on board.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.891
So it's pretty fun.

00:14:49.891 --> 00:14:50.640
It's pretty great.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:52.473
We've never been under
this much development

00:14:52.473 --> 00:14:56.170
in the last four decades to
do development of space launch

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.680
system, development of Orion.

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.980
These are major, major
development programs for us.

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:03.374
And show you this.

00:15:03.374 --> 00:15:04.040
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.640
As I said, we've been
on Mars for 50 years,

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.920
we've been exploring
Mars with our rovers.

00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:11.247
So this is the highlights reel.

00:15:11.247 --> 00:15:12.830
You can raise hand
when you were born.

00:15:12.830 --> 00:15:14.090

00:15:44.766 --> 00:15:47.730
You guys know there's a big time
delay between Earth and Mars,

00:15:47.730 --> 00:15:48.230
right?

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.440
So we really [INAUDIBLE]

You're waiting to
get the signals back.

So boy, when there's a
successful mission landing,

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.530
you are really psyched.

00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:59.282
Now, you guys are all born.

00:15:59.282 --> 00:16:01.240
Hopefully, you remember
some of these missions.

00:16:04.670 --> 00:16:09.860
We land in every way you can
possibly land to test out.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.790

to retro rockets.

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:23.655
incredible data today.

00:16:23.655 --> 00:16:25.030
There's dust devils
on Mars, too.

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.799
That's real.

00:16:25.799 --> 00:16:27.340
The Martian didn't
just make that up.

00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:34.360
Big challenges.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.270
And so our journey to
Mars-- we have a plan.

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:38.730
Please download it.

00:17:38.730 --> 00:17:40.120
It's clear and it's concise.

00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.890
It's really audacious.

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:42.980
It's tough.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:44.890
But again, we think that
it's the right thing

00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:47.380
to do for NASA to lead
and for the US to lead.

00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:49.740
And we are looking for
all kind of partners,

00:17:49.740 --> 00:17:52.970
specifically public,
private industry folks,

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.430
and international folks
who are all in saying,

00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:58.100
here are our plans and
it's global exploration.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.500
No one nation, no one space
agency does this alone.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.790
We're saying, these are the
pieces we're committed to.

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.960
This is what we can do, we
can sustain, we can afford.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.090
And then, hey, world,
what do you want to do?

00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:10.570
And so phase one, Space Station.

00:18:10.570 --> 00:18:11.870
We've been there for 16 years.

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.510
We're going to keep-- we'll
be on Space Station til 2024.

00:18:15.510 --> 00:18:18.440
But in parallel, space launch
system-- the 20th space launch

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.620
system, Orion,
we're in cislunar.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:23.370
We call that the proving ground
to really make the technology

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:24.990
investments that we need.

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:28.450
And then phase three
is onward to Mars.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:30.050
So that's our plan.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:35.190
We are charged by the President
to get humans to Mars orbit

00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:38.150
and then Boots on Mars
in the coming decades.

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:41.230
And so I like to say, it's
not something that just keeps

00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:42.430
moving out and moving out.

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:47.080
We're closer than we've
ever been in humanity

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.170
to sending people to Mars.

00:18:49.170 --> 00:18:52.130
So it's really-- like I said,
the metal is being built.

00:18:52.130 --> 00:18:55.172
We're investing in all these
systems-- so really amazing.

00:18:55.172 --> 00:18:56.630
It's still out
there til the 2030s,

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:59.114
but that's going too far
because we're making progress

00:18:59.114 --> 00:19:00.530
and we're making
these investments

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.470
to stay with this vision
and stay with this focus.

00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:05.136
Who knows about our
one year into space?

00:19:05.136 --> 00:19:06.050
Scott Kelly.

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:06.750
Great.

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:08.230
And he just came back.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.360
And he's a little sore.

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.130
Two months down.

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.213
Now We were just with him.

00:19:11.213 --> 00:19:12.080
His feet hurt.

00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:13.570
His feet hurt.

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:16.190
We're still really looking to
the physiological effects--

00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:18.610
psychological effects
and the physiology.

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.450
We have to keep looking at this.

00:19:20.450 --> 00:19:24.710
And there's about 35, 36
biomedical human risk factors.

00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.980
We're down to the top
three or so, really

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:29.130
trying to make sense of it.

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.110
Gave us the first time to
do our genomics in space.

00:19:33.110 --> 00:19:34.490
His identical twin
brother, Mark,

00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:36.240
as you know, a former
astronaut, down here

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.520
on ground, the control,
with Scott up there.

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:40.760
So we're just doing
the DNA sequencing now.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:44.460
I can't wait for the data coming
out in the next six months.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.170
We already know the microbiome
from Scott in weightlessness

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.460
is very changed--
radically altered.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.355
So great mission.

00:19:54.825 --> 00:19:56.450
This is just at lunch
time-- this talk.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:57.832
So make you guys hungry.

00:19:57.832 --> 00:20:00.040
First time we get to eat--
anything you can eat fresh

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.220
in space is a good day.

00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.470
This is our veggie experiment.

00:20:02.470 --> 00:20:05.040
So there's Kjell Lindgren
and Scott harvesting

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.950
with a Japanese colleague.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:08.940
And a little salad.

00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:09.990
Veggie's kind of small.

00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:11.120
It's veggie three.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.960
Just some of the
technologies-- the way

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.690
I like to explain
it is here's Mars.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.279
We have our Mars requirements.

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:18.320
And then we back it down.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.790
What can we do in the 2020s
in deep space cislunar?

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:22.889
What can we do today
on Space Station.

00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:24.680
What are those essential
Mars requirements?

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.580
Technology, and the physiology,
and the human health,

00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.520
astronaut performance.

00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.400
Here's just some
of the technologies

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.970
that we're testing
in microgravity

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:34.460
and we're investing in.

00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:35.510
How do you refuel?

00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:37.410
What about habitable structures?

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.350
Beam just got expanded.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.830
It's there for two years.

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:41.622
Take in data.

00:20:41.622 --> 00:20:44.080
We need that data because we
have to think about deep space

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:44.850
habitats.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.520
And you can see there's
humanoid robotics.

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.874
There's EVA systems,
we talked about.

00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:52.540
Fire in space-- not
that I recommend it,

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.706
but it's really cool in
terms of the physics, right?

00:20:54.706 --> 00:20:56.570
You don't have
convection and things.

00:20:56.570 --> 00:20:57.390
It's a blue flame.

00:20:57.390 --> 00:20:58.210
It's not being fed.

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.110
So actually, a fire
experiment is going up

00:21:01.110 --> 00:21:03.330
on the next cargo launch.

00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.800
Manufacturing.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.300
[INAUDIBLE]

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.810
We're working with private
industry to do manufacturing.

00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:12.710
We have our second 3D printer
up on Space Station today.

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.450
So I asked Scott-- I tweet.

00:21:14.450 --> 00:21:17.230
You can follow me
at DavaExplorer.

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:20.100
So I asked Scott what he thought
we should be doing-- what

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.540
technology do you
think we really

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.800
needed to work on for Station?

00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:23.466
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:23.466 --> 00:21:25.470
-I think the life
support systems

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:27.730
that we need to keep
us alive in space

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:31.600
are ideal candidates
for demonstrations

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.230
or a future journey to Mars,
as well as space suits.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:37.477
We need, I think, new
space suit technology.

00:21:37.477 --> 00:21:39.060
DAVA NEWMAN: I didn't
plant it, Boris.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:40.776
I didn't know you were
going to say that.

00:21:40.776 --> 00:21:42.610
- --in space.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:44.700
And something that's
going to be easier

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.270
to work in on the surface
under the Martian gravity.

00:21:48.270 --> 00:21:49.400
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.240
And maybe.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.420
He's a little biased because he
probably knows my background.

00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.970
But again, we're really trying
to say, what are these pushes?

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:56.719
What do we have to
invest in so that we're

00:21:56.719 --> 00:21:58.670
ready-- we'll be ready?

00:21:58.670 --> 00:22:00.840
And we have to be
strategic about that.

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:05.440
Again, wanted to make sure--
this is really incredible.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:07.479
Now, NASA is-- we're
buying services.

00:22:07.479 --> 00:22:08.770
They're not all of ours, right?

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:11.600
SpaceX and Orbital ATK--
they're bringing our cargo up.

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:15.470
We're so glad to, again
look at a new space

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.070
and what's possible
because we want to go

00:22:18.070 --> 00:22:19.380
further out and further out.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:20.590
And so we're very glad.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:22.450
And turn that over to industry.

00:22:22.450 --> 00:22:24.110
And also, Russia, you see there.

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:27.790
Russia is sending up cargo and
our astronauts, at this point.

00:22:27.790 --> 00:22:29.690
And then that's the Japanese.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:31.020
That's the HTV.

00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.634
So also, cargo
coming up from Japan.

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:34.050
Again, we're all
in this together.

00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:35.980
We want everyone to succeed.

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:37.480
That's where we're
placing our bets.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:41.530
We need everyone to
succeed to get this done.

00:22:41.530 --> 00:22:43.490
And you probably
know in the future

00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:46.270
then our commercial
crew, SpaceX and Boeing,

00:22:46.270 --> 00:22:48.010
will be sending
our astronauts up.

00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:48.840
They'll be sending
our astronauts

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.990
up just in over a year.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:53.112
We'll do the
testing out in 2017.

00:22:53.112 --> 00:22:55.320
And then we'll be sending
our astronauts up hopefully

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.100
early 2018.

00:22:57.100 --> 00:22:59.510
That makes us not
dependent, right now,

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:01.360
on the Russians, which we are.

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.760
So really investing in American
US economy to get that done.

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.790
We want to return launches
back here to the US.

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:11.820
So really, I look at Space
Station-- the entire Space

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:15.459
Station and this entire phase
one as the experiment itself.

00:23:15.459 --> 00:23:17.000
I look at-- is that's
the experiment.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.499
So that's how I
like to vision this.

00:23:18.499 --> 00:23:20.850
It's actually, maybe--
think of it as the analog--

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:22.330
the habitat analog.

00:23:22.330 --> 00:23:24.340
Now, it's really
huge and wonderful

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.570
and as big as a football
field-- whether you

00:23:26.570 --> 00:23:29.170
like real football or American
football, anyhow, good thing

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.650
is they're same size fields.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:32.969
That's how big Station is.

00:23:32.969 --> 00:23:35.010
And we're not sending
anything like this to Mars.

00:23:35.010 --> 00:23:37.070
But the experience,
and the analog,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:39.840
and living, and working in
these extreme environments

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:43.015
is the experiment that tells
us how we can go forward.

00:23:43.015 --> 00:23:44.890
And I'd like to-- hope
you guys can see this.

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:46.350
It's just an infographic.

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:49.980
You saw the video that had
50 years of being on Mars.

00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:52.010
But I only showed
you the successes.

00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:54.370
So truth in advertising here.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:55.150
It's hard.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:56.300
It's really far away.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.950
So the orange, red lines--
that's the former Soviet

00:23:59.950 --> 00:24:01.310
Union and Russia.

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.310
The blue are the US
and NASA attempts.

00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:05.790
We just tried to fly by.

00:24:05.790 --> 00:24:07.590
And then we had to--
can we orbit Mars?

00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:08.380
Can we land?

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:10.939
And you saw that--
well, the green checks--

00:24:10.939 --> 00:24:11.980
that's when we nailed it.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:12.896
That's when we hit it.

00:24:12.896 --> 00:24:14.400
But try, try, try.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.530
That's what it's all about.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:16.738
You just have to keep trying.

00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:19.550
And it kind of blew up
in the last 10 years.

00:24:19.550 --> 00:24:21.150
Now, really the last 15 years.

00:24:21.150 --> 00:24:22.460
Man, we've been nailing it.

00:24:22.460 --> 00:24:24.860
And you see Europe there.

00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.490
And you see the US
with Russia's help.

00:24:27.490 --> 00:24:31.320
And then you see the green
line-- India, first attempt.

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.190
So again, when anyone
succeeds, we succeed.

00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:35.150
We provide them our
deep space network,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:37.900
and we helped, and we did
the navigation because we

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.680
want everyone to succeed.

00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:42.450
That's in all of our interests
is how do we do this together.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:45.440
And ExoMars, which is the
European Space Agency mission,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.590
launched out of Russia.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:49.350
It's en route to Mars today.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.869
There's five rovers
and vehicles there.

00:24:51.869 --> 00:24:52.910
We're learning every day.

00:24:52.910 --> 00:24:55.920
Did you guys check the weather
on Mars before you came today?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:56.880
I check every morning.

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.080
It's beautiful.

00:24:58.080 --> 00:24:58.970
You're spoiled.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.297
I mean it's beautiful
California sunny weather.

00:25:01.297 --> 00:25:02.130
I used to live here.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:02.900
I remember this.

00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:04.554
Well, it's cold on Mars today.

00:25:04.554 --> 00:25:06.470
It's freezing-- couple
degrees below freezing.

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:08.630
It's always cold on Mars.

00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.600
And in the 2020s,
what we're doing

00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:13.690
is we-- our robotic precursor
missions-- they keep going.

00:25:13.690 --> 00:25:16.440
They necessarily keep going,
so we get data every day.

00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:18.890
We get a lot of data back
from Mars to get ready.

00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:22.170
So here's some icons
of what we need

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.790
to figure out in the
2020s with our precursors.

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:25.770
We'll be in deep space.

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:27.780
Again, this is all in parallel.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.600
And EDL, Entry,
Descent, and Landing.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.320
You saw it in the
movie-- coming in hot.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320
We don't how to do that.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.730
We know how to do it for 1
metric ton, right-- our rovers.

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:38.940
2 metric tons.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.620
Maybe it scales--
1 to 2 metric tons.

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.547
10, 20 metric tons?

00:25:43.547 --> 00:25:44.630
We got to figure that out.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.710
We got to figure that out.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:47.650
So a lot of research.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.660
And we really-- coming in hot.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:51.315
Mars has a 1% atmosphere.

00:25:51.315 --> 00:25:53.090
It's just a nuisance.

00:25:53.090 --> 00:25:53.990
Doesn't help at all.

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.677
That's not enough
drag to slow us down.

00:25:55.677 --> 00:25:56.510
Doesn't help at all.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:58.410
So really, coming in hot.

00:25:58.410 --> 00:25:59.680
Now, we have humans on board.

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.763
So this is a big challenge
for us, entry, descent,

00:26:01.763 --> 00:26:02.430
and landing.

00:26:02.430 --> 00:26:05.060
When we're on the surface--
what about in-situ resource

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.260
utilization.

00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:10.540
All successful exploration
in humanity-- people

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.439
live off the land.

00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:12.730
They make use of the resources.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.520
You don't take
everything with you.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.140
So we have to figure this out.

00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:18.200
When you go camping
across California

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:19.490
or the US-- guess what?

00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.930
You need those
fuel depots, right?

00:26:20.930 --> 00:26:22.180
You need those caches.

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.100
You have your caches
out when you go camping.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:26.360
So how do we do that?

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.759
We're thinking in
that mentality.

00:26:27.759 --> 00:26:29.050
How do you really get it right?

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:31.340
How do you have,
maybe, the fuel?

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:32.259
Methane.

00:26:32.259 --> 00:26:33.800
Looks like Mars has
even more methane

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.740
than we ever thought, right?

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.198
Hey, methane makes
good propulsion.

00:26:36.198 --> 00:26:38.640
So all these are really
research areas for us

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.510
about fuel and all the things--
the human robotic interface,

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:45.410
and hopefully all the things
that you guys are so smart in

00:26:45.410 --> 00:26:45.990
and work on.

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:50.560
And all these-- the autonomous
systems are critical.

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:53.530
I can't overstate the importance
of the criticality of-- when

00:26:53.530 --> 00:26:55.590
we get to Mars, it's
so far away, you

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:57.830
have to be completely
Earth independent.

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.900
We've never done that before--
completely Earth independent.

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.040
The proving ground--
your days to weeks

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:07.060
away from help in an emergency
or to get resupplies.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:09.870
But not with-- So it's a
really different paradigm

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:11.590
when we really get to Mars.

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:13.750
So our precursors
will be helping.

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:16.786
This is just a shout out, again.

00:27:16.786 --> 00:27:18.160
One fun thing at
NASA I get to be

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.470
in charge of-- partnerships--
over 700 of them.

00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:22.170
We work with 120 nations.

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:25.340
So it's much easier to say
who we're not working with.

00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.680
So just a big celebration.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.439
We're all in.

00:27:27.439 --> 00:27:28.730
And we're looking for partners.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:31.089
And some different
countries-- emerging

00:27:31.089 --> 00:27:32.880
countries that just
want to be part of it--

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.010
and we're saying absolutely.

00:27:35.010 --> 00:27:36.460
Mars 2020 is up on the left.

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:38.070
That's, again, the
next big Rover.

00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.641
Just great cooperation.

00:27:39.641 --> 00:27:41.640
Has this really cool
experiment on board-- well,

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.290
they're all cool experiments.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:45.890
But MOXIE-- it's
going to make oxygen.

00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.810
So we're going to make oxygen
the first time on a planet.

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.600
And it splits off the carbon.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.540
Since Mars is CO2 atmosphere,
it splits off the carbon atom.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:55.590
So then you're left with
oxygen. Now, not enough

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:58.530
for a person to survive
on, but it's a start.

00:27:58.530 --> 00:28:01.540
First time we can make
oxygen on another planet.

00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.170
And let's see.

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.690
I wouldn't-- I'm here in
NASA Ames, our center that--

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.849
it leads in across the spectrum.

00:28:08.849 --> 00:28:10.140
But we got to give a shout out.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.264
I am an aerospace engineer.

00:28:11.264 --> 00:28:14.860
So let me tell you,
flight is very exciting.

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:19.250
And I can't tell you-- we just
have a new aviations horizons--

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.250
a huge initiative.

00:28:20.250 --> 00:28:24.900
Hopefully, the next 10 years,
we'll invest $3.5 billion

00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:27.590
into aeronautics and aviation.

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.350
And this is the best
example, I think,

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:30.340
of what the
government does, what

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:32.506
NASA does-- putting in the
research and development.

00:28:32.506 --> 00:28:36.130
So up top-- that's our low
boom supersonic demonstrator.

00:28:36.130 --> 00:28:37.690
Just got back from Europe.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.780
I sure wish it was three
hours or four hours,

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:41.320
not the eight hours, right?

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.390
I just flew in last night here.

00:28:43.390 --> 00:28:46.460
Man, that would've been a
great two hour flight, right?

00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:48.670
So it's low boom.

00:28:48.670 --> 00:28:51.440
Continental US-- so it has to be
like a thump-- the supersonic.

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.410
And we can do it mostly
through geometry and moving

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.370
the shock back and off.

00:28:56.370 --> 00:28:58.840
And just announced
Friday, the little guy

00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:01.020
on the bottom-- it's
actually a hybrid electric.

00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.010
So hybrid electric air
flight coming to you.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.672
And again, we'll
hand it over and then

00:29:05.672 --> 00:29:07.880
the commercial folks will
hopefully commercialize it.

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:09.840
Just again, it's really
our best example.

00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:14.020
In the middle, these are ultra
efficient-- 50% fuel reduction

00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.230
and 50% noise reduction.

00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:19.640
So those are our eco-airplanes.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.290
They're our ultra
efficient airplanes.

00:29:21.290 --> 00:29:23.130
So this is-- we're
back in the business

00:29:23.130 --> 00:29:25.780
of X-plane, experimental
aircraft demonstrators.

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:30.080
It's incredibly exciting for us.

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.570
So I'm going to come full
circle back to Earth, as.

00:29:33.570 --> 00:29:35.360
I said, my favorite planet.

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.790
I don't know if you know
of our Discover mission.

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.434
I hope you do.

00:29:38.434 --> 00:29:40.100
Download the app
because you get to look

00:29:40.100 --> 00:29:43.100
at these beautiful
images every day.

00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.250
Now, Earth.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.360
Sun.

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.070
Lagrangian place.

00:29:47.070 --> 00:29:48.528
I love a technical
audience, right?

00:29:48.528 --> 00:29:50.810
You guys probably
actually know what L1 is.

00:29:50.810 --> 00:29:54.350
So this beautiful places
in between Earth and Sun.

00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:56.260
And it's gravity neutral.

00:29:56.260 --> 00:29:58.270
So it's a really good
place to hang out.

00:29:58.270 --> 00:29:59.920
So Discover is hanging out.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:04.670
And I just describe it as our
solar system weather buoy.

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:07.350
So all that solar wind
and solar radiation--

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.530
Discover is measuring
that and saying, hey,

00:30:09.530 --> 00:30:11.370
Earth here's what's
coming your way--

00:30:11.370 --> 00:30:13.360
since it's out there at L1.

00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.210
And then every month,
you get to see,

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:19.492
this is-- oh, you guys are going
to like this if you're my age.

00:30:19.492 --> 00:30:21.408
[MUSIC - PINK FLOYD, "DARK SIDE
 OF THE MOON"]

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.820
How many hours of grad
school did you study--

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.320
Doesn't everyone
listen to Pink Floyd?

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.940
Now, all my 26 and unders.

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:36.440
All right.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:36.990
I got a few.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:40.120
I got a few.

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.270
Well, thanks for--
but they got it wrong.

00:30:44.270 --> 00:30:45.770
There's not a dark
side of the moon.

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.270
It's the far side.

00:30:47.270 --> 00:30:49.455
It's the far side of the
moon is nice and lit.

00:30:49.455 --> 00:30:50.580
We just haven't been there.

00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:53.830
But now, Discover has shown us
what the far side of the moon

00:30:53.830 --> 00:30:54.810
looks like.

00:30:54.810 --> 00:30:58.180
So again, in all
that reflecting,

00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:02.420
we have over 20 Earth
science observing satellites.

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:04.080
We just say, eyes in the sky.

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.880
But we're pointed
right down on Earth.

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.620
So I just found out about the
Santa Barbara forest fires

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:10.260
happening.

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.896
Last month, we
just point our eyes

00:31:12.896 --> 00:31:15.270
when Canada-- when the great
forest fires now in Canada--

00:31:15.270 --> 00:31:17.890
will be a busy
summer unfortunately.

00:31:17.890 --> 00:31:22.400
What resources, what assets do
we have to look at the Earth?

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.780
Look in an ocean.

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:25.380
Look in an ocean sea rise.

00:31:25.380 --> 00:31:28.170
Melting, temperature,
all this-- what

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.219
all our earth-- and
now, NASA, what we

00:31:30.219 --> 00:31:32.260
do, we design, and build,
and fly the satellites.

00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:35.260
We hand them over to our
sister agencies NOA and USGS.

00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:37.620
And we work together really
well for all this earth

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.880
science data.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.050
And don't need to convince
this crowd, but let me show you

00:31:43.050 --> 00:31:44.450
a century.

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:47.440
It's in Celsius.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:51.240
Blue is lower than
average-- 1 or 2 degrees.

00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.910
And yellow is 1
degrees Celsius above.

00:31:55.910 --> 00:31:59.062
Dark red is 2 degrees
Celsius above average.

00:31:59.062 --> 00:32:01.270
So take a look at-- raise
your hand when you're born.

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:03.510
Woo.

00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:04.300
C'mon '70s.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.620
You guys there?

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.700
All right.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:15.680
So 2015, hottest year
in recorded history.

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.490
2016, we just got the
data back from May.

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:20.890
Hottest month recorded.

00:32:20.890 --> 00:32:23.430
Guess what my
prediction is for 2016.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.620
So that's just the data.

00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:27.630
I'm not interpreting it.

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:28.560
It's pretty amazing.

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:30.330
Pretty amazing.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:32.767
So it's just critical
and it's essential.

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:33.600
Take a look at this.

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:37.680
So I want to leave you with my
last few little slides for fun

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.180
here.

00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:41.084
I've spent my whole
career on STEM education.

00:32:41.084 --> 00:32:43.000
Isn't this what a rocket
scientist looks like?

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.950
I think maybe not.

00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:46.580
So I turned it into STEAMD.

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.310
And add a Rich Gold.

00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:50.700
Maybe some of you guys ever
had the pleasure to meet him.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:52.241
I think it's really--
the art science

00:32:52.241 --> 00:32:54.180
access has been worked a lot.

00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.430
I think it's really important.

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:56.230
I love that literature.

00:32:56.230 --> 00:32:58.334
But I think, as an engineer,
that maybe the design

00:32:58.334 --> 00:33:00.250
engineering access-- we
need to-- if we really

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.940
looked at this holistically,
we have big problems to help

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.230
solve for humanity, right?

00:33:07.230 --> 00:33:10.630
Water, climate, exploration.

00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:14.260
Again, all of this, I think,
we'd be best served to-- we're

00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.100
all in.

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.930
So for the artist, we need you.

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.162
They've always been part of
NASA's history and the US

00:33:21.162 --> 00:33:22.870
history because they're
the storytellers.

00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:23.970
They paint the pictures.

00:33:23.970 --> 00:33:26.930
Who better to paint our
picture of the journey to Mars

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.450
than artists, and the
storytellers, the journalists?

00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:32.650
And I actually now do a
lot of talks and speeches.

00:33:32.650 --> 00:33:36.430
I always put on the end STEAMD.

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:37.710
First, I'm pretty ticked off.

00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:38.440
I'm steamed.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.890
We are not making
enough progress quickly.

00:33:41.890 --> 00:33:43.139
And it's urgent.

00:33:43.139 --> 00:33:44.180
So we really need all in.

00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.910
I need every girl
and boy out there

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:47.770
to say, oh, we can do that?

00:33:47.770 --> 00:33:50.760
I see myself working on
one of these projects.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.060
So we need everyone.

00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:53.700
We have to be very inclusive.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.260
We can't filter people out.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:56.034
Just the opposite.

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.450
I think we need
to filter everyone

00:33:57.450 --> 00:34:01.450
in to-- what a better vocation.

00:34:01.450 --> 00:34:04.480
And again, so I just
can't speak enough to-- we

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.540
have to be inclusive.

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.540
We need an all hands on
deck to work with all of us.

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:12.800
And so my shout out to
the artists painting

00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:16.739
NASA's pictures from Earth
observation-- we actually

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:20.050
have this wonderful book
called "Earth As Art."

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:21.949
Anyone know where
this is in the world?

00:34:21.949 --> 00:34:24.380
Take a guess.

00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.640
This one's hard.

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.139
China.

00:34:26.139 --> 00:34:27.880
I'll be flying there
in a couple days.

00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:30.100
How about this one?

00:34:30.100 --> 00:34:32.270
Any guesses.

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:34.020
That's Algeria.

00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:37.340
This one-- that's a
really cold continent.

00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.940
Everyone should know that one.

00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:43.279
Still-- but beautiful, magical.

00:34:43.279 --> 00:34:44.570
Now, everyone should know this.

00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:51.840
Down south-- South America.

00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.940
People?

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:53.440
The Nazca.

00:34:53.440 --> 00:34:54.040
I think I heard it.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:54.610
Yeah.

00:34:54.610 --> 00:34:55.750
These are from orbit.

00:34:55.750 --> 00:34:57.425
These are the Nazca
lines in Peru.

00:35:00.210 --> 00:35:01.220
There you go.

00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:05.269
Andy Warhol even got
into the-- again, all in.

00:35:05.269 --> 00:35:06.060
These are enduring.

00:35:06.060 --> 00:35:07.820
These images stay with us.

00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.057
And Eileen Collins was our
first female shuttle commander.

00:35:11.057 --> 00:35:12.890
And this is a photograph
by Annie Leibovitz.

00:35:12.890 --> 00:35:16.080
So they've always been with
us to tell our stories.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:19.910
So anyhow, this is the
fun, incredible job

00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:22.600
that I have every day to be able
to talk to people about how we

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.220
get humanity, interplanetary,
and Boots on Mars

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.780
and by, we say, 2030s.

00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:30.240
So I'm going to finish
my comments there.

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.920
And I have some
beautiful images here.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.100
And I will take any
questions and just show you

00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.410
these beautiful images.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:41.685
This is a new IMAX movie,
"A Beautiful Planet."

00:35:41.685 --> 00:35:42.560
And it just came out.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.230
Hopefully, it's open
in the Bay Areas.

00:35:44.230 --> 00:35:45.420
Do you guys know
if it opened here?

00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:46.490
AUDIENCE: I don't know if
it has opened here yet.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:48.323
DAVA NEWMAN: Maybe it
hasn't opened up here.

00:35:48.323 --> 00:35:49.340
Just came here.

00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:52.990
It's really beautiful--
ultra hi-def images taken

00:35:52.990 --> 00:35:54.942
by our astronauts on board.

00:35:54.942 --> 00:35:56.150
So thanks for your attention.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:58.978
What's on your mind?

00:35:58.978 --> 00:36:00.886
[APPLAUSE]

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:09.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for talking to us.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.200
My question is about
the kind of interplay

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.400
between NASA and
SpaceX with respect

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.980
to putting people on Mars.

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:18.920
So in what ways do NASA
and SpaceX work together

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:19.670
towards that goal?

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:21.770
And in what ways do
they do their own thing?

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:24.980
And then also,
what is NASA's goal

00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:27.210
after we put people on Mars?

00:36:27.210 --> 00:36:30.180
Like SpaceX's is to actually
colonize Mars and have

00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:31.590
a backup of the human race.

00:36:31.590 --> 00:36:34.560
What does NASA want to do after
we are able to put researchers

00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:35.340
on Mars?

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:35.910
DAVA NEWMAN: So thanks.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:36.576
Great questions.

00:36:36.576 --> 00:36:38.390
So we worked together
in partnerships.

00:36:38.390 --> 00:36:41.450
As I said, right now,
SpaceX has given us cargo

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.550
to Space Station.

00:36:42.550 --> 00:36:44.980
And then astronauts
coming for the crew.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:47.780
And then in terms
of Red Dragon--

00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:49.580
don't you read my blog?

00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.280
We extended our Space
Act Agreement for EDL.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.880
Again, we're all about the
data and let's get this right.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.740
And so, we're working
in cooperation

00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.615
with SpaceX on Red Dragon to get
that EDL-- the entry, descent,

00:37:03.615 --> 00:37:05.620
and landing data
for larger masses.

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:07.520
So that's what we're
doing together, today.

00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:09.250
It's our huge investment.

00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:11.430
Again from NASA into
SpaceX because I

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:14.200
say we're counting
on them to succeed.

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.390
And we're not in
competition at all.

00:37:16.390 --> 00:37:17.090
We're seeding.

00:37:17.090 --> 00:37:20.470
It's government funds going
into, again, the private sector

00:37:20.470 --> 00:37:22.100
to make sure that they succeed.

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:27.170
Now, Elon's vision of getting to
Mars and people-- that's great.

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:30.560
We, as a government and the
US-- we'll be there together.

00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.120
There's really interesting
opportunities then,

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.200
as I mentioned before--
cargo and split missions.

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.140
And things like that.

00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.510
So we really do think
then in the coming decades

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.820
that people will be on Mars.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.300
Now, from NASA's
perspective, it's

00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.254
round trip-- very important
to call that out just

00:37:44.254 --> 00:37:45.920
so there's no confusion--
so round trip.

00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:50.760
So we look at multiple missions
and getting people there.

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.970
But go back to the
enduring question for us.

00:37:52.970 --> 00:37:55.840
Again, it's to look for
the past evidence of life,

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:57.550
like being a fossil
hunter, if you will.

00:37:57.550 --> 00:37:58.572
Our Rovers are there.

00:37:58.572 --> 00:37:59.780
We're getting data every day.

00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.320
But was Mars once habitable?

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.140
So for us, there's also the
big science drivers-- looking

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:08.110
for past evidence of life.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:14.942
Now, if Elon and Jeff are in
competition with each other,

00:38:14.942 --> 00:38:16.150
as well, that's a good thing.

00:38:16.150 --> 00:38:17.190
That's friendly competition.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.960
But that's not the government.

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.820
Again, where we're
partnering with everyone

00:38:19.820 --> 00:38:21.930
and looking for
everyone's success.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:23.980
So hopefully, does
that help answer?

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.130
Yeah.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:26.880
AUDIENCE: Is there any
concern about being

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:29.650
reliant on one country--
in this case Russia-- given

00:38:29.650 --> 00:38:32.540
geopolitical tensions about them
being the ones that are taking

00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:35.020
astronauts up to Space Station?

00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:37.150
DAVA NEWMAN: So great the
question. [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.200
What about being
reliant on the Russians

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.110
for a launch for astronauts?

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:43.330
And they're great partners.

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:45.972
I would like to hold up--
this is soft diplomacy.

00:38:45.972 --> 00:38:47.430
It's my best example
I can give you

00:38:47.430 --> 00:38:50.060
with tensions-- political
tensions in the world.

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:54.850
But guess what, NASA, meaning
the US and Russia-- we've

00:38:54.850 --> 00:38:57.340
been working together
famously dependent on one

00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.000
another for 16 years.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.900
So really, we're held up as an
example of what's going right.

00:39:02.900 --> 00:39:05.530
And it really is soft
diplomacy and working together.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:09.120
We just figure out a way to
do it, given other politics.

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.750
We just-- we're
in this together.

00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:13.466
We have great-- we're
engineers and scientists.

00:39:13.466 --> 00:39:14.590
So these are great friends.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:17.540
I've worked with the
Russians since the '90s.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.630
We have three decades
of great history.

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:21.810
And even before that--
you know Apollo-Soyuz?

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:23.600
Not lost on us.

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.820
In the tension of
the Cold War, there's

00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:28.140
an astronaut and a Russian
cosmonaut shaking hands.

00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:30.050
So we just look it
up as an exemplar.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:32.550
And that's why we're interested
in partnering in the future.

00:39:32.550 --> 00:39:33.990
We think it's a
great partnership.

00:39:33.990 --> 00:39:36.530
But then when it
comes to the economy

00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:39.557
and helping US businesses
and things-- well,

00:39:39.557 --> 00:39:40.640
we're all about that, too.

00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:41.760
And that's what
government-- so that's

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:44.009
why we're so excited about
returning the launches back

00:39:44.009 --> 00:39:45.900
to US soil-- so
that, again, it's

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:47.150
nice to have a nice portfolio.

00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:50.780
But we'll be comfortable
when SpaceX and Boeing are

00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.750
launching our astronauts back
here from the Kennedy Space

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:54.360
Center.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.660
So that's how we look at it.

00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.440
Again, great partners, soft
diplomacy, great example.

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:02.830
And then again, working
with everyone we can.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:03.870
Thanks

00:40:03.870 --> 00:40:07.880
AUDIENCE: What's your
take on Mars One?

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.990
DAVA NEWMAN: As I said,
the government-- we're

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:11.410
doing a round trip.

00:40:11.410 --> 00:40:12.672
And inspiration.

00:40:12.672 --> 00:40:13.380
Good inspiration.

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:14.590
I love the vision.

00:40:14.590 --> 00:40:16.290
But not credible.

00:40:16.290 --> 00:40:17.870
No funding.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:20.646
Not the right technology.

00:40:20.646 --> 00:40:22.140
Not expertise.

00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:23.540
Great.

00:40:23.540 --> 00:40:24.560
good vision.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:25.580
It's great to inspire.

00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.680
I like the inspire part.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:30.724
AUDIENCE: So in the '60s,
there was a lot of excitement

00:40:30.724 --> 00:40:33.140
around the space program with
going to the moon and stuff.

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.999
How do we build that same
level of excitement today?

00:40:35.999 --> 00:40:37.540
DAVA NEWMAN: Thanks
for the question.

00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.860
This is where-- I am
a former academic.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:40.859
So I'm going to start
asking you guys questions.

00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.170
I need to hear from you.

00:40:45.170 --> 00:40:47.340
I can tell you what we're
doing-- citizen science.

00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:50.440
And we really want to
take humanity with us.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.870
This is-- four fortunate
astronauts-- the first Mars

00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:55.820
Explorers, and even
the commercial guys--

00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:58.850
it's still a very limited
number of folks, right?

00:40:58.850 --> 00:41:00.700
So how do we open it up?

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.080
How do we take everyone with us?

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.500
So it's as compelling as
the-- what did we just see?

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.990
The Tilt Brush--
that I was there.

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:10.289
I was just in 3-D space.

00:41:10.289 --> 00:41:11.830
So how can we take
the world with us?

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.185
So we're really thinking about
that for citizen science.

00:41:14.185 --> 00:41:16.310
We're making these investments
for all of humanity.

00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:19.580
And again, the Apollo
heritage is so great

00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:22.450
that humanity really-- we
wont be going and planting

00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:23.215
in a US flag.

00:41:23.215 --> 00:41:26.040
What we'll be doing is
saying, hey world, we're here.

00:41:26.040 --> 00:41:27.290
And we're doing this together.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:29.020
But we really want
to hear from you all,

00:41:29.020 --> 00:41:32.277
and tell us how we can work
together, and take and open it

00:41:32.277 --> 00:41:33.860
up so that everyone
feels like they're

00:41:33.860 --> 00:41:36.035
part of the mission because
that's really our goal--

00:41:36.035 --> 00:41:37.660
kind of part of every
mission because I

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.990
got to highlight a few.

00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:42.010
We're doing 100 solar
system missions, right now.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:44.580
How many aeronautics
campaigns are we doing Eugene?

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:45.570
Dozens and dozens.

00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:47.080
So in my limited
time, I don't get

00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:49.600
to tell you about the
hundreds of-- it's

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.430
a big portfolio,
which is so cool.

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.310
But we want to
open it up and have

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:55.940
whatever people's
interests are and passion--

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:56.900
so it might be climate.

00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:57.710
It might be flight.

00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:58.450
It might be something else.

00:41:58.450 --> 00:42:00.370
We want to say, hey,
we're open government.

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:01.780
We're trying to do a
lot of these things

00:42:01.780 --> 00:42:03.390
in terms of innovation,
open government,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.473
to make sure everyone can
participate because it's

00:42:05.473 --> 00:42:06.844
your tax dollars, after all.

00:42:06.844 --> 00:42:09.010
AUDIENCE: How much will be
happening just next door?

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.380
And can we go see the planes?

00:42:13.270 --> 00:42:19.610
And then also, the
multi-propeller hybrid electric

00:42:19.610 --> 00:42:25.380
models-- are you looking at
full electric propulsion,

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:28.110
no petrochemicals
at all for those?

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:29.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.850
DAVA NEWMAN: So it's
hybrid electric.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:32.700
And I'll get Eugene
involved in here.

00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.520
A lot is happening
here it NASA Ames.

00:42:36.520 --> 00:42:37.640
What can people see?

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:43.410
EUGENE: Don't know yet, but the
actual airplanes themselves,

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.967
I'm anticipating, will be
tested down in Armstrong

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:48.050
down in the Mojave Desert.

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:49.969
But we will likely
do quite a bit

00:42:49.969 --> 00:42:51.260
of wind tunnel testing up here.

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:55.280
So scale models of
them or if, of course,

00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:58.176
they need the full scale test
in the largest wind tunnel,

00:42:58.176 --> 00:42:59.850
it could be full scale.

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.560
Also, we're likely
here, at Ames,

00:43:02.560 --> 00:43:05.620
to be quite involved in much
of the autonomy work related

00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:08.470
to them, much of the
computational analysis

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.540
with our supercomputers.

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:13.370
And so we do expect to see
quite a bit of work related

00:43:13.370 --> 00:43:14.860
to these X-planes here at Ames.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.401
Whether you'll actually see the
flight vehicles themselves up

00:43:17.401 --> 00:43:19.910
here or we'll have to get you
down to Southern California--

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:21.180
that remains to be seen.

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:21.930
DAVA NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:43:21.930 --> 00:43:23.864
So Armstrong is our
flight research center.

00:43:23.864 --> 00:43:25.780
But hopefully they'll
come by and just buzz us

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.550
a little bit-- they
give us a little wing

00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.100
tip or something like.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.140
But yeah, so definitely west
coast kind of investments.

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.380
Very exciting.

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:37.070
It's been a long time to get
this investment back to era

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:39.222
where we should
be just to lead--

00:43:39.222 --> 00:43:40.930
to lead in these
things-- really critical

00:43:40.930 --> 00:43:43.580
that the US is making these
investments in X-planes

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:45.290
for the future.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:48.170
And it is-- just to make
sure-- it's hybrid electric

00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:48.890
for the motors.

00:43:48.890 --> 00:43:51.500
That's six motors on each wing.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.500
So that's 12 electric motors.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:55.402
But we always call it
the hybrid electric.

00:43:55.402 --> 00:43:57.610
It's the second out of the
gates after the supersonic

00:43:57.610 --> 00:44:01.660
because we can do
phase one, right now.

00:44:01.660 --> 00:44:05.570
That's my day job is trying
to secure the NASA budget-- so

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:08.747
see what we can get in terms of
support so we can keep going.

00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:10.580
But that's why we just
announced on Friday--

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.120
I think it was Friday--
to do the phase

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.340
one for the hybrid electrics.

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.930
And then phase 2 is much larger.

00:44:15.930 --> 00:44:16.880
But no time.

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:18.280
We got to get started.

00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:19.863
SPEAKER: I guess I
have two questions.

00:44:19.863 --> 00:44:23.270
One is more sciencey and one
is more political since NASA--

00:44:23.270 --> 00:44:25.100
DAVA NEWMAN: Do science first.

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.480
SPEAKER: So the
sciencey one is this.

00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:29.740
So there's people who
say why are we going all

00:44:29.740 --> 00:44:31.450
the way to Mars with humans?

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:34.800
Why don't we do the moon, again,
first, and train, and whatnot,

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.132
and only then do Mars.

00:44:36.132 --> 00:44:37.840
DAVA NEWMAN: So I'll
take that first one.

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.720
So those building
blocks, that road map,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:43.830
we've said we will be in
earth moon orbit, cislunar.

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.020
So we're going to the moon.

00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:48.010
We have constrained budgets.

00:44:48.010 --> 00:44:51.800
And so we're saying for our
investments and technology,

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:54.201
solar electric propulsion,
deep space habitats,

00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:56.450
advanced life support systems--
all these technologies

00:44:56.450 --> 00:45:00.040
we need to prove out in
cislunar and even deep space.

00:45:00.040 --> 00:45:02.940
But we're saying, hey, world, if
someone wants to lead and have

00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.940
a lunar Lander, great.

00:45:04.940 --> 00:45:06.691
Then, we'll get a NASA
astronaut on board.

00:45:06.691 --> 00:45:07.731
We'll take you out there.

00:45:07.731 --> 00:45:09.530
But we're saying,
for our investments,

00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:10.460
you can't do it all.

00:45:10.460 --> 00:45:11.800
It's just too expensive.

00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.508
So we're saying, we'll
get you out there.

00:45:13.508 --> 00:45:16.390
We're going to be focused on
our technology development--

00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:18.040
proving ground.

00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:20.580
But for sure, we're going
to see humanity on the moon.

00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.080
And again, given this--
that's why we're opening up.

00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.163
It's a global exploration.

00:45:23.163 --> 00:45:24.850
So hopefully, that's
multi-- hopefully

00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.140
that's global-- real global.

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:28.520
We just can't lead
in all those things.

00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.910
So that's what NASA-- so
that's why our vision is Mars.

00:45:30.910 --> 00:45:34.260
Clearly, that's a horizon goal
because it's so hard and never

00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:34.800
been done.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:38.170
And again, we're going there to
look for past evidence of life.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.510
So we're really
clear about that.

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:41.340
Does that help?

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.550
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:45:42.550 --> 00:45:44.830
It makes complete
sense to me, as well.

00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:46.900
Now the second, a little
bit tougher question

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.060
is NASA is a big organization.

00:45:49.060 --> 00:45:49.960
It covers--

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:52.552
DAVA NEWMAN: 17,500--
just down from 18,000.

00:45:52.552 --> 00:45:54.760
SPEAKER: It is still not as
big as the United Nations

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.260
because I remember, when I was
working at the United Nations

00:45:57.260 --> 00:46:00.570
High Commissioner for Refugees,
it was 120,000 people.

00:46:00.570 --> 00:46:03.630
But it is pretty big.

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:08.680
And it does have aeronautics
and space within it.

00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:13.460
Things seem to take a little
bit longer time, people say,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.177
than they used to in the '60s.

00:46:16.177 --> 00:46:18.010
There are people who
are saying, oh, we just

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:21.410
did a seat of the pants thing
without so much analysis

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:22.200
and whatnot.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:26.786
We just tested things-- they
worked, we went with them.

00:46:26.786 --> 00:46:28.730
Some people complain
about red tape.

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:32.410
Some people complain
about misuse of funding.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:36.960
Can you tell us a little
bit the internal scoop--

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.669
the higher level scoop--

00:46:38.669 --> 00:46:39.960
DAVA NEWMAN: What are we doing.

00:46:39.960 --> 00:46:44.000
SPEAKER: What are you guys
doing to counterbalance

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.540
the growth and the spreading
of [INAUDIBLE] administration,

00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.020
because I think that
lesson might be useful

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:51.020
here at Google, as well.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:51.686
DAVA NEWMAN: OK.

00:46:51.686 --> 00:46:53.710
Yeah, because the big and
growth-- and actually,

00:46:53.710 --> 00:46:56.835
so at NASA we're reducing--
so it used to be 18,000.

00:46:56.835 --> 00:47:00.612
Now civil servants-- we're
going down to 17,500.

00:47:00.612 --> 00:47:02.570
And again, you want the
best and the brightest.

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:04.390
And you want to have
these great challenges.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:06.723
That's how you get great
people-- same as Silicon Valley

00:47:06.723 --> 00:47:07.334
here.

00:47:07.334 --> 00:47:09.750
But it's important to know we
can have 3 to 1 contractors,

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:10.420
too.

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:13.690
So our family is not
just the civil servants.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:15.459
Really, the numbers
are much larger.

00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:16.875
And that's just
kind of what we're

00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:19.030
calling inside the
gates, our contractors--

00:47:19.030 --> 00:47:22.250
not even our big contracts that
we let out, but our brothers

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:23.300
and sisters.

00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:25.290
So it is large.

00:47:25.290 --> 00:47:27.170
But again, we're trying
to-- we get that.

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:29.972
And when you're 50 year--
you're a bureaucracy.

00:47:29.972 --> 00:47:31.430
We have to see how
can we do things

00:47:31.430 --> 00:47:34.800
so-- the partnerships-- Ames
is actually a great example.

00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.070
How can we do this?

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:37.460
It's hierarchical.

00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.960
For a former
academic, no kidding.

00:47:39.960 --> 00:47:41.960
But you say, how can you
be really successful?

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.330
How can you still be lean?

00:47:43.330 --> 00:47:46.570
How can you do a mission
like this and get it right?

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.520
And to me, it comes
down to innovation.

00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.420
And so that's not
surprising that we're here

00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.850
at Google and other places.

00:47:52.850 --> 00:47:55.300
And really, I think
it's innovate or die.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.380
So how do we get
the technologies

00:47:57.380 --> 00:47:59.320
and-- here's NASA's budget.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:01.940
There's other very large
government budgets out there.

00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:02.450
We're here.

00:48:02.450 --> 00:48:03.241
There's large ones.

00:48:03.241 --> 00:48:05.450
So we say, for us,
it has to be very

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:09.180
specific to NASA-- we have to
invest in those technologies

00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:11.220
that only NASA should
because the rest of them--

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:14.010
we should be able to get and
partner with other agencies

00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:15.349
or with industry.

00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:17.140
And we have to change
organizational model.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:18.848
How do we change the
organizational model

00:48:18.848 --> 00:48:20.190
to get this done?

00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:21.134
So we're on that.

00:48:21.134 --> 00:48:22.550
But again, that's
why we're really

00:48:22.550 --> 00:48:24.720
going out and talking
to industry folks

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:26.810
and saying how do we--
what are new ways--

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:28.966
help us think about new
ways to get this done.

00:48:28.966 --> 00:48:30.340
And we're very
cognizant of that.

00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:33.120
So it's pretty exciting because
we're also somewhere in history

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.230
that I think is
truly a crossroads.

00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.392
NASA's been working
on commercial space

00:48:37.392 --> 00:48:39.350
for a long time and a
lot of different offices.

00:48:39.350 --> 00:48:41.730
And now, we just know
it's here to stay.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.790
So we're at this really
incredible place in history

00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:46.630
that is just is here to stay.

00:48:46.630 --> 00:48:48.960
And we think low Earth orbit
will be commercialized.

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:49.729
Well, guess what?

00:48:49.729 --> 00:48:51.520
We're placing all our
bets there because we

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.728
need to get out into the--
we want to get to the moon

00:48:53.728 --> 00:48:55.970
and then get to Mars.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:59.920
But please, again, you
guys are growing, as well.

00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:04.000
So again, how to do that and
stay innovative and efficient

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.370
is something-- good lessons
learned for government

00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:07.470
agencies, as well.

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.595
SPEAKER: And probably just
to put it in perspective

00:49:09.595 --> 00:49:12.100
so people don't take this as a
negative thing-- NASA is big.

00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:16.270
But it's my new school like in
budget comparisons compared to,

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.240
for example, the
Department of Defense

00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:19.860
or some of the other agencies.

00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:20.680
DAVA NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:22.580
Order of magnitude
less and then some.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.570
SPEAKER: It's like 1/2%, right?

00:49:24.570 --> 00:49:27.990
DAVA NEWMAN: We're, right now,
less than 0.5% of the GDP.

00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:30.420
We're 0.48% or
something like that.

00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:32.800
Apollo-- we were 5%?

00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:33.650
Yeah.

00:49:33.650 --> 00:49:37.310
So we're down an
order of magnitude.

00:49:37.310 --> 00:49:38.914
And it's still a
robust-- we're not--

00:49:38.914 --> 00:49:40.830
we're fighting for every
penny because we want

00:49:40.830 --> 00:49:42.070
to make these
investments in aero

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:43.278
and we want to get this done.

00:49:43.278 --> 00:49:46.790
And we think, within these
budgets, if we do it right,

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:49.310
and sustainable, and
affordable, we'll get there.

00:49:49.310 --> 00:49:51.980
It takes a little bit
longer, of course.

00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:53.740
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for your talk.

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.210
Just a quick question,
did you consider

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:58.695
sending animals to Mars?

00:49:58.695 --> 00:50:00.320
DAVA NEWMAN: Early
test flights, again,

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.800
with the Russians and the US.

00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:04.000
Some animals, now.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.340
In terms of the biology
and the physiology,

00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:11.160
we actually fly animal models
up in Space Station, today.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:16.580
We use it as even little
quadrapeds-- mouse and rodent

00:50:16.580 --> 00:50:19.140
models and figure
out how they're doing

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:20.460
in the weightless environment.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:22.150
And we get to Mars, of
course, we have gravity again.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:23.900
So it's this really
interesting three year

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:25.620
plus mission where,
essentially, you

00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:29.770
go out with conventional
rocket propellant.

00:50:29.770 --> 00:50:32.976
About eight months there,
say, two year round trip,

00:50:32.976 --> 00:50:34.600
let's call it-- take
the short leg out.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.710
And then 600 days on
the surface of Mars.

00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:39.400
And so three days gravity
when you get to Mars.

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.610
But so we learn.

00:50:41.610 --> 00:50:43.950
We learn from animal
studies, and rodents,

00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:46.530
and things like that.

00:50:46.530 --> 00:50:49.550
Right now, that's the
scientific research.

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:53.930
They're not the critical path
to getting the astronauts there.

00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:55.810
But we're learning a lot.

00:50:55.810 --> 00:50:58.950
I can give you a couple
examples, like musculoskeletal.

00:50:58.950 --> 00:51:03.180
So bone loss up on
space station-- 1% to 2%

00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.490
per month of bone
mineral density loss.

00:51:06.490 --> 00:51:09.682
Now, you want to do on your one
year mission for Scott Kelly.

00:51:09.682 --> 00:51:11.390
Well, he doesn't have
that much bone loss

00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:12.431
because we're exercising.

00:51:12.431 --> 00:51:14.010
We call them countermeasures.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:15.910
So exercising and
things like that.

00:51:15.910 --> 00:51:18.200
So cardiovascular,
not a problem.

00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:21.170
Neurovestibular-- you might
be sick for a few days.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:23.630
That's OK, if you're
up there a year.

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:28.990
But we have a new
phenomena, VIIP.

00:51:28.990 --> 00:51:32.010
So we have a visual-- we have
interocular pressure that's

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.511
really causing some visual--
not with all of our astronauts,

00:51:34.511 --> 00:51:36.051
but with some of
them, and especially

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.280
some of the veterans.

00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:37.840
What's that?

00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.190
So we are on it-- figuring out.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:42.670
We have to make sure
people have good vision.

00:51:42.670 --> 00:51:44.560
And what's this into
intraocular pressure

00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.980
because you're in microgravity
and the fluids shift.

00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:49.950
And it's probably pressing on
the cranial nerve and things

00:51:49.950 --> 00:51:50.450
like that.

00:51:50.450 --> 00:51:53.390
And so we're thinking about
how do we deal with that.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:56.330
Can't be sending people in this
long duration to Mars mission

00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.830
until we figure that out.

00:51:57.830 --> 00:52:00.060
And that's a new one just
in the last few years.

00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.340
So some of this
physiology, again-- so when

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.130
we look at something
like that-- and radiation

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:08.992
for our astronauts is the number
one-- radiation protection.

00:52:08.992 --> 00:52:10.700
So again, thinking
about how you do that.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:12.158
How do you do
radiation protection?

00:52:12.158 --> 00:52:13.710
We're in low earth
orbit on station.

00:52:13.710 --> 00:52:15.710
That's kind of
nice and protected.

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:17.370
So we've got to figure this out.

00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:19.430
We're going to be
literally bombarded

00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:20.770
by the galactic cosmic rays.

00:52:20.770 --> 00:52:22.450
So we need radiation protection.

00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:24.330
And that's again,
the proving ground.

00:52:24.330 --> 00:52:26.560
We learned a lot
more about that.

00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.810
Curiosity, the Mars
MSL-- our current Rover

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.780
has this cool experiment
called RAD on it for radiation.

00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:34.090
And it was really great.

00:52:34.090 --> 00:52:36.530
We turned it on its
mission to Mars.

00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:39.140
So we got a radiation profile
all the way out to Mars.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.844
And it's still
working today on Mars.

00:52:40.844 --> 00:52:42.260
So again, every
day we're learning

00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.470
more about the radiation
environment on Mars.

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:46.440
But we really have
to protect-- again,

00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:49.719
all the electronics,
as well as the people.

00:52:49.719 --> 00:52:50.760
AUDIENCE: Hi, Dr. Newman.

00:52:50.760 --> 00:52:52.790
Thanks for the talk.

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:54.790
So I forget the term
for this concept,

00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:59.182
but there's a concept related
to the quantity of satellites

00:52:59.182 --> 00:53:00.140
that you have in orbit.

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:01.960
And at some point
you reach saturation,

00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:06.200
and they start colliding,
and chain reacting.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:08.480
This seems like a really
big concern, especially

00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.370
as the number of satellites
that we're putting up

00:53:11.370 --> 00:53:14.026
is accelerating, as
the number of launches

00:53:14.026 --> 00:53:15.400
that we're having
is accelerating

00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:21.180
with satellite internet,
and cable, and so forth.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:23.350
Is there a research
team at NASA looking

00:53:23.350 --> 00:53:25.670
into how to deal with
this sort of thing?

00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:26.420
DAVA NEWMAN: Yeah.

00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.060
So we look at orbital debris.

00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.921
And especially in
low Earth orbit,

00:53:29.921 --> 00:53:31.170
you can take some good images.

00:53:31.170 --> 00:53:32.760
And they probably are shocking,
if you haven't looked at it.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.970
So there's a lot of
stuff which is great.

00:53:34.970 --> 00:53:36.060
It's good that it's busy.

00:53:36.060 --> 00:53:38.810
But again, just take
low Earth orbit.

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.110
It's going 17,500
miles per hour.

00:53:41.110 --> 00:53:43.740
So a little fleck--
a little paint chip

00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:45.270
is like a serious
bullet that can

00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:48.210
rip through our solar panels.

00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:51.320
We get nicks on the Space
Station since it is so big.

00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.800
We get nicked in every
station that's up there.

00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:54.899
So a couple things.

00:53:54.899 --> 00:53:56.940
In terms of orbital debris,
interestingly enough,

00:53:56.940 --> 00:54:00.020
this gets really into
the policy area of things

00:54:00.020 --> 00:54:02.060
because we need
international agreement

00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:04.440
and treaties because
it's not just us.

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:05.266
It's not just NASA.

00:54:05.266 --> 00:54:06.140
It's not just the US.

00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.960
This is really
international space.

00:54:07.960 --> 00:54:12.440
So interesting to think about
governance and orbital debris.

00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.370
And it also puts
a premium, to me,

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:17.570
as an engineer-- the
thrusters and how you deorbit.

00:54:17.570 --> 00:54:18.607
CubeSat going out there.

00:54:18.607 --> 00:54:19.190
They're great.

00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.773
They're small.

00:54:19.773 --> 00:54:22.117
Everyone can do it.

00:54:22.117 --> 00:54:22.950
And they'll burn up.

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:23.620
They're nice.

00:54:23.620 --> 00:54:26.100
Small six unit.

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:29.620
But we got to make sure
that can we deorbit them?

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:30.600
Do they burn up?

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:33.140
And can we have some--
we have thrusters

00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:36.105
and that's how you adjust
your attitude, basically,

00:54:36.105 --> 00:54:36.980
when you're up there.

00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:41.200
And so it really puts a
premium on that aspect of it.

00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.920
US space command just
tracks a centimeter--

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:47.400
I think it's just 1
centimeter and above.

00:54:47.400 --> 00:54:50.390
Other, smaller particles,
and things like that are not.

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:53.070
So it's a great question
as we get more populous.

00:54:53.070 --> 00:54:55.530
And then again, geo--
we go up to geoorbit.

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:56.510
Well, guess what?

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:59.140
A lot of people like to go to
geo, as well, because that's

00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:02.080
great for Earth observations and
it's great for spy satellites.

00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:05.070
So as we do this--
but to the point.

00:55:05.070 --> 00:55:06.815
We think about it a lot.

00:55:06.815 --> 00:55:08.065
There's a lot of studies done.

00:55:08.065 --> 00:55:09.440
So NASA's very active.

00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.270
But what happens is
we have to engage.

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:12.350
We are engaged.

00:55:12.350 --> 00:55:14.210
I just was at the
UN last week and I

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:17.967
was on the Committee on the
Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.

00:55:17.967 --> 00:55:20.050
So we were talking about
long term sustainability.

00:55:20.050 --> 00:55:21.930
I'm talking with the
world, literally,

00:55:21.930 --> 00:55:25.050
about these kind of
issues-- orbital debris,

00:55:25.050 --> 00:55:27.946
planetary protection,
things like that.

00:55:27.946 --> 00:55:30.382
SPEAKER: Thank Dava Newman
for visiting Google.

00:55:30.382 --> 00:55:31.590
DAVA NEWMAN: Thank you, guys.

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:32.190
Thank you.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:33.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:55:33.990 --> 00:55:35.540
My pleasure.
