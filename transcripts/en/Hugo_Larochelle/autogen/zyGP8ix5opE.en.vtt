00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 in this capsule we will see the notion 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.350
 of substitution so we are seen 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.540
 previously only to make a prep 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.540
 resolution need some tools 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.559
 too much that we will need the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.880
 substitution 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.730
 so that's what we will see in this 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:22.230
 capsule i'm going to start by defining 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.720
 some terms 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.820
 firstly the notion of literal 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.099
 so a bed land that will match 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.859
 to a Wallinian predicate in the negation 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 of a body loan so the predicted cope 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:40.020
 a case xy or the country negation xy you 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.059
 both make shorelines to those 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.390
 of his going to define the notion of klose a 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.270
 clause will correspond to a disjunction 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:54.920
 of several liberals for example if 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:59.219
 I had the literal country xy of 2 xyz 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.079
 t1 or the negation of peace 1x z 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.400
 but if I do disjunction everything 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.040
 that would be what's called a clause 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.220
 so now a substitution is going 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.250
 to be a set that predicts so a 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.509
 set of fathers of the form xxi equal 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.369
 country where fingers is a variable 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 was hyper more generally a 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.979
 term it will have to be synonymous only in 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.600
 the set all the xy are distinct 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.119
 which they correspond to variables 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.610
 be different here is an example of a 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.130
 substitution the set of x and galls 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.920
 john and y equals father of the constant 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.710
 town hall so we notice here that right 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.060
 we can have a more complicated term 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.710
 as a function involves at a 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.240
 constant sahara even could be a 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.310
 variable if we could have had another 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.049
 variable will give way to town hall or 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.720
 performers simply a 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:57.649
 constant and the substitution is going 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.439
 actually correspond to an operation 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.439
 would change all the values ​​of x for 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.640
 the variables that are integrating them into 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.640
 term that is sometimes involved 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.689
 so as I have a die the application 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:20.360
 a substitution will we note here 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:22.250
 head to an alpha literal is so there 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.909
 this laval app has rated alpha 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:29.000
 head to your correspond to take alpha 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.950
 then to replace all 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.110
 the occurrences of variables etc if by 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.510
 their term to society i in the 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.269
 substitution and we will do that for 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.500
 each of the fathers of substitution xxi 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.940
 equality there is we will say that al fath and 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.549
 so that's the result of 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.579
 the application of the substitution will be 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:53.090
 an instance of alpha for the 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:58.760
 substituting ths states for example its 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.459
 notice the following literal and xy f1 and 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.700
 that we had the substitution ths state that 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:11.000
 says who is replaced by x and x by b 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.569
 and apply the solution teta a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.989
 littoral 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:19.160
 alpha would correspond to take by name 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:22.190
 excluded replaced by b here we would get 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.769
 this part there too and then take the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:28.129
 variable y is replaced by the term x 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.780
 would go there would be replaced by x to mark 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.120
 and that it is not him replaced this 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.769
 after by have made an Arabic the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.769
 simultaneous seed so in parallel 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.010
 for each of the arguments of the predicted 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.209
 that in and finally fpa not charge him 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.790
 since it can involve in the 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.859
 substitution 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.260
 so that's for a loner in 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.599
 now his pen c is fine 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.120
 applied a substitution amazes you klaus 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.099
 and where macro sea corresponds to 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.730
 the addition of a term 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.970
 alpha 1 to alpha n2 literals 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.340
 forgiveness while it brakes well the 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.760
 clause resulting from the application of 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.260
 head has enough your the addition of 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:13.099
 each of the eight heroes we have 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:17.510
 applied the substitution maybe we 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:21.310
 was going to nerdy nerds or a us site 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:26.230
 up to al fahem head 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.850
 we can compose together several 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.350
 substitution so let's imagine that 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.919
 state institutions that involves 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.169
 variables x1 up to excellent and a 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.770
 sigma substitution that involves 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:43.270
 variables y 1 to ym 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:45.669
 we might want to apply step 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.590
 is then applied sigma so that's it 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:51.400
 is going to be a community composition head 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:53.169
 in the cinema so mark that we add 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:55.000
 all the time there after a literal one 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:56.320
 clause we add on the right the 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.600
 institutions that we wish to apply 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:04.900
 in order now the composition 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:09.040
 head to the sigma did we can calculate it 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.900
 if we are given here the formula for head 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.520
 to the form nothing is actually in 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:14.979
 able to lead what is the whole 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.370
 business substitutions in head to 

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:22.180
 sigma with a small procedure with the 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:24.220
 three next steps 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.830
 so we'll see the next three steps 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:30.130
 to know an example then we start 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.289
 to build the whole by taking 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.940
 two heads to all of these variables 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:39.160
 x so we extracted here until xx 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:41.950
 and the term associated in fact we're going 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.650
 take the term s then we want him 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:47.400
 apply the sigma substitution which is 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.030
 the second source is also our 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.060
 our composition 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.710
 so we do that for and 5 against what 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.450
 we apply the association sigma then to 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:56.310
 Saint-mont applies the competition six 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.750
 month also 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.760
 so this is the first part of my 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.120
 together the second part it's going to be 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:07.419
 outright substitution 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:09.010
 sigma that I just tried then 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.500
 meaning we will do what we want 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:14.050
 delete all the pairs left there y 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.270
 are such as years philippe legré who 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.660
 corresponds to one of the variables in the 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:23.110
 substitution head so 1d x there in the 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.030
 substitution of time and finally one 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:30.340
 will delete the identities ie 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:33.370
 fathers or is it sinaï became 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.780
 exactly excludes so forward with a 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.570
 example cross-country look 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.330
 turn it a lot more concrete then 

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:42.700
 imagine that we have the substitution ths 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:44.590
 is to follow 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:48.460
 to be applied followed by the 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:50.800
 substitute sigma or dante is one to aix 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:53.860
 who is replaced by f 2 yy who 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:56.169
 replaced by z then dancing man x which 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.660
 replaced by the constant at and then there is 

00:06:56.169 --> 00:07:00.910
 replaced by the constant b as well as the 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.530
 z replaced by a statement by the 

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:09.310
 variable forgiveness y first step on 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:12.220
 take sigma we insert according to the new 

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:13.480
 substitution set and apply 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.880
 in his words 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:17.500
 so we have the first term icipe the 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.070
 second term here we will apply the 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:23.440
 sigma substitution are doing that gets 

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:28.000
 the next thing so became b 

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:31.690
 as specified in sigma then aix is 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.820
 become there forgiveness z became that you 

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:35.110
 have substituted by y 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:37.389
 so if we had said before we are 

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:39.850
 rendered with y who added in the 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:46.290
 rest of the set exactly the 

00:07:39.850 --> 00:07:46.290
 substituting for pigments then of that 

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.000
 what we do is we look 

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.130
 among the variables involved in the 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.650
 second part of my composition so 

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:59.410
 that the variables of the 

00:07:56.650 --> 00:08:02.490
 singbo substitution which are already 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:05.620
 in the part that comes from head 

00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:09.039
 when if we find x who finds himself 

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:11.950
 already here we find there who finds himself 

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:15.750
 already here then just the bars and 

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.750
 so remove them from our times his 

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:21.190
 third step 

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:22.720
 we identify who are the fathers who 

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.640
 match invariably affected or 

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:26.860
 substitute by itself 

00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.530
 this is the case here then you simply 

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:32.589
 that once remove it and so the 

00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:37.089
 result it's going to be the fathers that remains 

00:08:32.589 --> 00:08:41.849
 to know and ségala f2b we have here then z 

00:08:37.089 --> 00:08:41.849
 is equal to y who from here 

00:08:44.209 --> 00:08:50.190
 finally some properties of 

00:08:47.070 --> 00:08:53.790
 substitutions identity substitution 

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:54.839
 that we do not pound that corresponds to 

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.279
 all fast, that means doing 

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:59.029
 absolutely nothing is actually 

00:08:56.279 --> 00:09:01.680
 identity since if I take a 

00:08:59.029 --> 00:09:04.170
 trotot stone is a property if I 

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:06.029
 take a substitution ths state that I 

00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:08.490
 compose it with the deletion 

00:09:06.029 --> 00:09:10.980
 Belgian identity gets one more time 

00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:13.079
 is it just the original solution 

00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:20.570
 of state and so that's the equivalent of 

00:09:13.079 --> 00:09:23.490
 do nothing next if I literally 

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:26.519
 to which I apply the sigma substitution 

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:28.260
 and that I'm going to take this and apply the 

00:09:26.519 --> 00:09:30.449
 rite so the instance of that said he 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.730
 the substitution head to ben is 

00:09:30.449 --> 00:09:34.260
 the equivalent of actually taking sigma 

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:35.399
 theta compose them together then 

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.630
 finally take the result 

00:09:35.399 --> 00:09:40.769
 apply it to montayral alpha so that 

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:45.260
 it's true for a literal but it's 

00:09:40.769 --> 00:09:48.060
 also true in general for a clause and 

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:52.230
 finally if I had three 

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:54.089
 substitutions teta sigma also and 

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.890
 well compose the first two then 

00:09:54.089 --> 00:09:59.040
 finally the third or dial the 

00:09:55.890 --> 00:10:01.199
 last two and finally take the 

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.140
 result deal with the first that 

00:10:01.199 --> 00:10:06.140
 give exactly the same solution 

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.140
 overall
