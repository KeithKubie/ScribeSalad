JAMES GRIME: Well, we're going
to talk about illegal numbers.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.260
And when I heard that there
were these things, illegal

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.220
numbers, that some numbers were
illegal, I was shocked

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.130
and surprised as well.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.550
Today, in the modern world,
numbers are used as keys to

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.650
encrypt secret information.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.790
They're used to encrypt or
protect DVDs as well, so that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.090
you can't illegally copy
films off a DVD.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.720
You need to protect
those keys.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.620
So if you distribute those
secret keys, those secret

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:34.020
numbers, this is
a real problem.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.320
And some people are claiming
that it would be illegal to

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.460
distribute those numbers.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.150
And so it's the number itself
that becomes illegal.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.010
And there are some other
problems as well because you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.830
can consider a digital
photograph or a computer

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.740
program as simply as a string
of binary digits.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.320
And then a string of binary
digits is a number.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.160
So there is a number
for a photograph

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.780
or a computer program.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.192
So if you distribute the number,
you could sort of work

00:01:03.192 --> 00:01:06.305
out the original computer
program or the image.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:08.900
And if that's an illegal
computer program that's

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.210
hacking data, then does the
number become illegal itself?

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.940
To show you the problem, I
thought, I don't want to write

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.720
down any illegal numbers
in this video.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.640
So I thought I'd come up
with my own example.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.080
So imagine if we decide
to trademark the name

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.040
Numberphile.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.310
So we're going to write down
Numberphile first of all.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.490
I'm going to use capital letters
because I like the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.870
number we got at
the end better.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.540
So I'm going to use capital
letters for Numberphile.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.000
I've written out the
word Numberphile.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.810
Now, each character in ASCII has
a binary representation.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.610
So let's do that.

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.340
So for the capital
N, 01001110.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.170
And now I can do it up
for the U as well.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.220
But I'd better get them right.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.855
You know they'll notice.

00:01:54.855 --> 00:01:59.170
The H, 0101.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.970
Whoo.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.270
So that's Numberphile written
as a binary string.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.910
So if we joined all that
together, that's just one big

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.680
binary number.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.590
Do you want to know what
that number is?

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.470
So that number in
decimal is 94--

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.880
040--

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.560
177.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.100
So this is Numberphile
written as a number,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.920
the Numberphile number.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.730
And if I catch any of you
distributing this number about

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.830
on the internet, right, you're
infringing our trademark, OK?

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.840
Don't let me catch
you doing that.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.070
There is a serious problem.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.810
So I'm a mathematician,
not a lawyer.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.090
I can't talk about the full
implications of this.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.810
I'm hoping that I am giving
you the extreme case, a

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.630
simplified extreme case.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.400
But at the very least, this is
what we're trying to avoid,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.330
that numbers themselves
become illegal.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.730
That's what we're trying to
avoid because the implications

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:57.500
of it are bizarre.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.580
So you can't distribute
these illegal numbers.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.410
But then can you distribute
the number minus 1?

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.430
Or if I write down a list of
numbers where some of them are

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.380
illegal, am I allowed to
distribute that list?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.620
I hope that it's distributing
the number and the intent to

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.830
infringe copyright.

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.820
But the extreme case is what
we're trying to avoid.

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.470
It has become a problem.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.030
In recent years, there have been
a couple of cases where

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.190
people like Sony have sued
people for distributing their

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:35.700
secret encryption keys for
their PlayStation 3.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.790
And the Motion Picture
Association of America have

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.710
forced people to remove posts
that were encryption keys for

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.400
their DVDs, which people were
using to illegally copy DVDs.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.350
This annoyed the internet.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.700
Ah, the internet-- this
annoyed them.

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.850
So then they started to
taunt these people.

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.430
So what they started
to do next is they

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.960
would take these numbers.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.910
And to taunt, they would then
turn these numbers into

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.500
hexadecimal.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.160
And hexadecimal defines
colors as well.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.180
So then they become
illegal colors.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.570
If I do this for Numberphile--

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.320
I've worked this out already.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.820
This number, which is 94
septillion and something, if I

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.710
write it in hexadecimal--

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.960
5D--

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:27.440
4, 2--

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.610
42, 4, 5--

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.590
so this is the Numberphile
number written as hexadecimal.

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.000
Now, these groups here
define a color.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.390
Each of those groups define a
color, and then we've got a

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.840
little bit extra.

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.970
So what you can do then is you
can make something like this.

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.660
So these are the three colors
defined by the Numberphile

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.610
number plus that little
extra bit.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.510
And then if you start posting
this around on internet

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.550
forums, again, you'll be
infringing our trademark, and

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.410
we'll be round to come
round your house.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.870
And we're going to stamp on
all your favorite toys.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.110
So I don't want to catch
any of you doing that.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.550
BRADY HARAN: So here are some
of those taunting protests

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.950
that James referred
to in the video.

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.300
These are colored flags based
on the DVD and PlayStation

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.500
encoding numbers.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.740
Of course, another issue we
didn't touch on this video

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.080
surrounds copyrighting
of numbers like pi.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.610
And there's a lot of stories
involving that, too.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.790
Maybe we'll talk about
that another time.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.640
A quick thanks to James Clewett,
who actually turned

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.600
the Mona Lisa into zeros
and ones for me.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.390
And if you'd like to read more
about that, I'll put a link in

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.120
the video description.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.695
And lastly, because we're a
lot more relaxed about our

00:05:44.695 --> 00:05:47.420
illegal numbers here at
Numberphile, James Grime and I

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:50.610
have put that piece of paper
used in the video on eBay in

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.500
case anyone wants to get
their hands on it.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.330
Again, links in the
video description.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:56.460
Thanks for watching.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.710
And we'll be back with
more videos soon.
