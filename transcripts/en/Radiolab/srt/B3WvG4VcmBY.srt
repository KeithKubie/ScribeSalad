1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:05,700
You are listening to radio
lab radio from W N Y s t.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,240
E n n.

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:12,040
P. E. R. Go

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:14,860
ahead of the everyday routine. Ooh,

5
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,870
ever dream of a life of
romantic adventure. Yeah.

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,730
Wanda, get away from it
all. Yeah, we offer you

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:26,773
[inaudible].

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,100
What do you use them this way?

9
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:31,380
Escape is, I end the free
you from the ball walls up

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:33,990
today or a half hour of high adventure.

11
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:37,671
Okay,

12
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:42,671
so this is an old time radio show from
the 1940s late forties I forget that

13
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,330
called escape. It always
starts the same way. You know

14
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,760
we offer you state

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,980
that phrase. I love how they say,

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,460
and here's what's great about this show
and why it seems like a good way to

17
00:00:53,461 --> 00:00:57,570
start this show. Our show
is it immediately after
they say that phrase? Yes.

18
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,710
They then present you with a scenario
from which there seems to be no escape.

19
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:05,320
What are hanging by your fingertips
on the sheer face of an ice cliff.

20
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:09,790
Like here's one suspended a thousand
feet above incident death with your

21
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,540
strength running out and
with no chance for escape.

22
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:16,423
There's a million of them

23
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:20,820
pretty alone. I brought a tiny gunk
on the ground off the coast of Borneo.

24
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,670
You were lost in the London fog.

25
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:26,930
[inaudible] you are the subject
of an experiment, actually.

26
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,490
Ancient aimless tear, right?

27
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,410
You can take your blood. Uh, no.

28
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:33,270
Great. Oh wait, one more.
One more just for kicks.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,450
You're like trapped in the remote
valley of the Andrea Walden by rock.

30
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:43,840
Recommend a landing you
closing in on you in the band,

31
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,500
the blind man, the one [inaudible].

32
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,030
How could you not listen to that?

33
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,560
What is better than like a story where
the walls are closing and nonunion?

34
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,730
Don't know what you're gonna do. What
am I gonna do? What am I going to do?

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:01,230
And then suddenly, or Skype, it's
like the best story ever. That's true.

36
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,240
So you're ready. Okay.

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,560
This hour we offer you three bizarre
scenarios to stories of people and planets

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,560
trying yearning who, Hey,

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,210
will they make it? And if they do,

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,240
what are the escaping? Okay,

41
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:29,160
enough of that. I'm Jad, I'm Robert.
This is Radiolab and, uh, to start,

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,360
let's talk about escape artists
because why not, right? I mean,

43
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,290
this is an escape show.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,700
The most famous escape artist in
history is probably Harry Houdini.

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,210
And our first story is kind of a Houdini
story. It comes from our producer pat.

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,980
Yes. It's about a guy whose
nickname is little Houdini.

47
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,940
Right? Yeah. I heard the story from my
friend Ben. Hello. Like months ago. Oh,

48
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,910
your brother Ben, your journalism
friend? My journalism friend. Yeah.

49
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,530
I'm a reporter with the Tampa Bay
Times in Florida, but our story begins

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,670
at the Attorney Center
penitentiary and only Tennessee.

51
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:06,970
That's where we caught up with little
Houdini. He was between escapes.

52
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,930
A couple of guards walked
us into this huge cafeteria,

53
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,790
sat us down at this little tiny
table and brought out Chris,

54
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,520
Chris Gay. That's his
name. Yeah. Do y'all have,

55
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,860
do you interview my brother
and everything? Yeah,

56
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:22,880
we talk then come over
here and, sorry. Yeah,

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,500
I guess the first thing I noticed was he
was even smaller than I expected him to

58
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,750
be, was going to be little,
you know, nickname. But uh,

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,410
he was a very little reading short
little guy. Maybe five. Five, yeah.

60
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:39,910
One 41 30 kids. Prison uniform
was pretty baggy on him.

61
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,610
He was wearing a white ball cap and a,

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,400
he's got a big smile stretched
across his face. Skyping,

63
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:50,140
I think is it's actually addicted, I
think. Addicted. Yeah. I think it is,

64
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,110
but I think what's addictive about
it, it's, it's, it's a way to, uh,

65
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:59,170
it's a way to punchy. I'm gonna
stomach say, Hey, this can be done.

66
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,040
I can do this. I might not have been the,

67
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:03,380
y'all might have told me I can't
do no, no. My life more people.

68
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,230
And I've told me that
now I know I can do it.

69
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,700
How many times have you escaped?

70
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,930
Probably about 13. 13, 1313 out of jail.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,750
Yeah. And unfortunate
to Arthur k made all 13.

72
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,710
I did a little research to see how that
compares to other Houdini's and there

73
00:04:23,711 --> 00:04:26,560
are a few people who come close
as far as I was able to find out.

74
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,050
Nobody alive has that many escapes.

75
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:34,110
Could we say pretty safely that
he's the greatest jailbreaker alive.

76
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,090
I'll go ahead and call him that. Yeah.

77
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,780
So I got away from a Amanda
pretty much without even asking.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:45,460
Chris began the list of the scape. He
has escaped every way you can imagine.

79
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:47,920
Slip my hand, clip off and
know what the dire dose,

80
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:50,380
what out the band in between the
[inaudible] jumped the fence,

81
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,090
poured all my clothes, upset my
boxer shorts like handcuffs. He said,

82
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,590
picking a handcuff keys,
one of the easiest things
he's ever done. Sure enough,

83
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,570
he's used everything from a
pen spring to a safety pin.

84
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,660
Even once a zipper thing might hang
KP out. My zipper scrambled out.

85
00:05:05,661 --> 00:05:10,360
Windows ran out doors, climbed over
walls under walls, drilled through them.

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,160
State suicide twice. He's tricked the
cops by drawing up fake escape plans,

87
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,540
food their dogs by covering
his clothes and pepper. Pepper.

88
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,910
Another time he didn't have any pepper,
but he had found some roadkill. Stoke.

89
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,340
They did smell like a skunk. He rubs
it all of his body to a racist scent.

90
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,410
Pretty good at hiding too.
He's hitting the trees,

91
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:31,840
jumped down a trap door that
he cut the floor, his trailer.

92
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:36,100
Once he hit in a grave, I'll, I was
a shallow grave beside a dead body.

93
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:36,821
Another time.

94
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:41,230
He ended up in a college campus someplace
outside Atlanta and he hit out on top

95
00:05:41,231 --> 00:05:42,790
of an air duct for two days

96
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,450
until the coast is clear.

97
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,900
But one of the interesting things about
Chris is that even though he's been

98
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:53,830
doing this for 20 years, there's never
a record of him assaulting anyone. No,

99
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:59,060
I'll refuse to do it. Stole things.
Pretty much only things to help him run.

100
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,850
I always refused to go in
somebodies house hours,

101
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,420
refused to go in somebody's garage.

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,310
She says you got rules
from self about how he

103
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,930
breaks the law. Almost
like a coat. In fact,

104
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:11,560
the story that got Ben Interested in
Chris in the first place is kind of the

105
00:06:11,561 --> 00:06:12,790
perfect example of this.

106
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,990
This was a few years ago in 2007 and
got a press release from the Florida

107
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,510
highway patrol. Be on the
lookout for, you know,

108
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,700
Chris Gay according to the [inaudible]

109
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,180
press release. Here's what happened.

110
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,420
Chris had been locked up in Alabama
when he got a telephone call from his

111
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:30,080
family. He said, my mom was
a, was dying. She had cancer.

112
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,390
So he faked suicide,

113
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,510
busted out of the prison transport van
that was bringing him to the hospital,

114
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:40,010
stole a truck, and just started driving
home. Who's going to see his mom today?

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,730
His last respects and expected to live
there alone as he comes around the bend

116
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,080
in the road to where his mom lives.

117
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:49,130
He's driving a Walmart tractor trailer
and he's got like a dozen cops on his

118
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,460
tail. When I get Dan are running,

119
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,990
I'll run off the road crashes truck
into a field near his mom's trailer,

120
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,480
jumps out of the truck just as I was
running toward the house. They start,

121
00:06:56,481 --> 00:06:58,820
they've jumped out of the cars and running
towards me and just before he makes

122
00:06:58,821 --> 00:07:01,730
it inside, they chase him into
the woods and he disappears

123
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:06,340
without seeing his mom who
had ended up dying before,

124
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:09,600
he could see her few days later,

125
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,750
Chris turns up in Daytona beach driving
a tour bus that belonged to crystal

126
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,740
gale. They picked the
country singer. Yeah,

127
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:24,600
he's still crystal. Gail's tour bus in
Tennessee and then drove it to Florida.

128
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,030
Yeah. So you get this pressure right

129
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,550
in any think what I thought, how
do you miss with a story like this?

130
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,310
So Ben writes a story for
the newspaper, Big News,

131
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:38,340
and pretty soon actually tour bus that
normally carries TV news people on it

132
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:42,610
that took off and he's an escape
artist and something of a folk hero.

133
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:46,390
And soon crispy came something
of a folk song. Literally

134
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:50,410
[inaudible] Chris got caught at Grammy
Award winning bluegrass picker named Tim

135
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,040
O'Brien put out a song called
the ballot of Christopher Daniel.

136
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,110
Daniel Gay,

137
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:59,140
pretty soon of famous Hollywood
director bought the rights to the movie.

138
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,220
They were originally trying
to get a Johnny Depp to do it,

139
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:06,710
but they fit in the magazines again.

140
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:11,980
It's perfect. You're the
underdog making a run for it,

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,090
for what seemed to dance on them
to be really good intentions.

142
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:21,570
And part of me thought, you know, I
mean this is awesome, but it's also,

143
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:26,070
I mean there's gotta be more
to this story. Absolutely.

144
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,870
Who's this guy really? And
why does he keep running

145
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,540
for booking destination? You want
to tell us where we're going.

146
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,440
Going to Buckeye bottom road to talk to

147
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,250
tare gay is Chris, his older brother.

148
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,160
He says he can tell us that whole
story about how they grew up.

149
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,400
Here we are. Chris grew up in a small
trailer out in the middle of nowhere,

150
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:56,040
West Nashville. There
are some junk cars off in

151
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,930
the woods. If I entirely hanging out
with a couple buddies drinking two beers,

152
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,620
I'll have any certain things you want to
know about or anything or can we start

153
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,900
talking about what it was like when
they were kids now we lived in a little

154
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,630
bitty trailer down there. He
points off into the woods,

155
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,870
across the street on this
land. It was Chris and Tyree.

156
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,140
Mom and dad and a little brother named
Eddie who went by cotton and then there

157
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:20,430
was Leanne lane gay, the eldest, I
mean his older sister, cottons in jail,

158
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,720
so we weren't able to interview him,

159
00:09:21,721 --> 00:09:25,050
but Leanne and Terry both told us that
growing up in that trailer was hard.

160
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:29,550
We grew up like mountain
paving you? No, no electricity,

161
00:09:29,551 --> 00:09:33,300
no running water did their wash and the
river wasn't always much food around.

162
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:38,240
I used to be a big field of
plums, a big plant thick.

163
00:09:38,241 --> 00:09:41,850
It would go down and woody,
but you can't live on plums.

164
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:46,560
And a lot of days we would be hungry.
Leanne remembers they're lying in bed.

165
00:09:46,561 --> 00:09:49,920
One night night she couldn't go to sleep
because her hunger pangs were so bad

166
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,950
and tare said, here, this'll help ya.

167
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:57,450
And he ripped up and little dying
notebook paper gave it to Leanne. He said,

168
00:09:57,451 --> 00:09:59,900
just chew it up real good and
swallow it and it'll help ya.

169
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:04,110
And for Chris and his little brother
cotton, those were the good days.

170
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:07,620
[inaudible]

171
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:10,620
because when my daddy and her separated,

172
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,340
mom and dad got a divorce and
the family split apart. Sorry.

173
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,050
Leanne went to live with mom.
Chris and his little brother Eddie,

174
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:21,000
who are 10 and 11. At that point moved
in with her dad and her dad, dad,

175
00:10:21,001 --> 00:10:25,650
he really wasn't, you know, I don't
guess he just wouldn't know provider.

176
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:28,340
He wasn't around very much. I mean, he

177
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,850
was a

178
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:33,050
a deadbeat. Yeah. Yeah,
he, he got where he, uh,

179
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:36,560
he would get off work on Fridays and he
wouldn't come home for weeks at a time.

180
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,970
He'd tell him to go if they was
hungry to go steal from churches.

181
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:43,880
Sometimes they'd hike through the
woods to their grandfather's house,

182
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,990
their mom's Dad, who Chris says hated
him and his little brother cotton,

183
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,340
let me go down there and he would, he,

184
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,550
he got where he started making
us fight each other and we could,

185
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:56,250
if we fist out each other in the
winter, got some d, You know,

186
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,133
he was mean.

187
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:01,520
So that was their life beating each
other up for food. We had no kids sick.

188
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,493
He goes on this.

189
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,670
So one night one of them went and
found their dad's rifle and old 22

190
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:12,890
and a tube sock full of rusty
bullets and went out behind the barn,

191
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,930
uh, lit a tire fire and, uh,

192
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,320
made a suicide pact.

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:20,800
[inaudible]

194
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,580
cotton was going to shoot Chris in
the forehead and then shoot himself.

195
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,200
And Chris closed his eyes and cotton
put the gun to Chris's forehead.

196
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:34,780
Chris heard him whimper and he opened
his eyes and concept, I can't do it.

197
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,290
And Chris said, well, let
me, let me, let me do it.

198
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:41,560
He took the gun and he put the
barrel to his brother's head

199
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:46,820
and he couldn't pull the trigger either.
And they were 10 and 11 at this point.

200
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,020
10 and 11 man. And Ben says,
if you take a step back,

201
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:53,980
you can see that it's
right about here at this

202
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,450
point that Chris and his brothers
started to steal, like really steal.

203
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:00,880
I started that like that on bicycles.
And then they went to a little,

204
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:03,670
I guess forwarders and motorcycle
is all stuff with wheels.

205
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,083
Yeah.

206
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:10,450
Chris remembers going with cotton
to sit on a bluff on interstate 40.

207
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,880
We would go a wash,

208
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,330
the trucks go by and they
would dream about getting in a,

209
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,510
in a semi and driving far
away. Then they went to a,

210
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,610
I guess four wheelers,

211
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,270
motorcycles and cars,

212
00:12:24,271 --> 00:12:27,150
and then gradually got bigger
and bigger and bigger to one day.

213
00:12:27,151 --> 00:12:29,280
When Chris was 17, he stole

214
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,980
a a semi, didn't even really
know how to drive it, but um,

215
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,960
I kind of decided the keys was in it,

216
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,570
so I started it up and from there
there was really no looking back.

217
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,940
Can I pause you right
there before you continue?

218
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:47,020
Let me just name some modes of
transportation and you tell me yes or no.

219
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,370
What are you still in
a semi bulldozer? Yes.

220
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:55,340
Skid steer, skid steer, tractor, backhoe,

221
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:59,640
anything that's the flies. I actually
got in a helicopter once and uh,

222
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,990
we got in there, started flipping
switches and we finally got it.

223
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,930
We got the blade rotate, but it was a low,

224
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,460
low thing and we got scared
and got out of it. Point is,

225
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,920
this is his life for more than two
decades. The only things that move,

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,560
getting caught and escaping,
stealing things that move,

227
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:19,561
getting caught and escaping until
eventually he became bat guy on TV who had

228
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,130
police on the rod and six states.

229
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:28,900
But then one night something happened
that seemed like it might break this loop

230
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,460
forever. He met a girl? Yes. Yes.

231
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:37,660
Her name was missy. She was waiting
tables and a little campsite diner.

232
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:42,160
He thought she was cute and Missy, he's
a smooth talker. I'll give him that.

233
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:46,750
She liked the way he taught it
was taken right off the bat.

234
00:13:46,751 --> 00:13:51,751
And a few months later I got pregnant
with my daughter and me and him moved in

235
00:13:52,311 --> 00:13:54,820
together and for awhile life was really,

236
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:58,320
we still had a little money in a bank
and I was working good for a Gregory

237
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,920
instruction, had a good paying job,
running it up bulldozer. And uh,

238
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,630
I was actually going to school in
Lebanon to give him a CDO license.

239
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:09,220
We had a nice trailer and
it had a refrigerator.

240
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:12,280
Did you like it? Yeah, we ever
looked at. Matter of fact,

241
00:14:12,281 --> 00:14:16,150
I was talking to my daughter last night.
It came real close with my daughters.

242
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:20,380
She remembers it like it was
yesterday. He got her a dog.

243
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:25,040
She named him blackjack first puppy. She
ever got that right there was the, uh,

244
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,660
it was the best moments
in days of diapers,

245
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,810
days I think for mine in
his life I ever worked in.

246
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,420
But then things got complicated.

247
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,780
The one day when Chris and missy
were driving in the car together,

248
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,780
we were going right through in the
middle of Nashville and, uh, Chris says,

249
00:14:44,781 --> 00:14:46,430
look, I gotta tell you something.

250
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:52,400
I stole something cause I start a
bobcat tractor from my construction

251
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,140
job and to make ends meet.

252
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:59,010
As soon as she heard that missy
whipped her head around. And um,

253
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:01,440
I like hitting with a big mat
right in the middle of Nashville.

254
00:15:01,441 --> 00:15:04,800
And I wanted to for a big man.

255
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,360
Yes I did, but it was only
funny for a little while.

256
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:11,820
A couple of days later
somebody told on me,

257
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:16,560
I got arrested and he stayed in jail
for about two years and then escaped.

258
00:15:16,561 --> 00:15:18,210
I don't know how exactly
right before long,

259
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:23,130
he stole again and ended up
back in jail again. And um,

260
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,550
and Missy, I stayed by
his side again. She,

261
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,910
she was determined he'd come home
from these escapes saying, Oh,

262
00:15:29,911 --> 00:15:31,080
just tell to being locked up.

263
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,050
He did being away from you guys didn't
want to be away from my kids and I didn't

264
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:36,270
want to be away from messy.
He's time. He got locked up.

265
00:15:36,271 --> 00:15:37,740
Missy would write him letters.

266
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:42,660
I would send him money cause I work the
whole time I was pregnant with my a 13

267
00:15:42,661 --> 00:15:46,140
year old. What kind of work were you
doing? I worked on the sand in line,

268
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,820
standard rocking chairs.

269
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,470
Chris meanwhile was thinking about his
next escape and when he came charging

270
00:15:52,471 --> 00:15:55,800
through the front door, thinking of
roadkill, telling missy that again,

271
00:15:55,801 --> 00:15:58,650
he had escaped. I stayed with him again.

272
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,840
But this time I started asking for
check stubs on a weekly basis and adding

273
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,430
hours up that he'd been gone
from time he left the house,

274
00:16:07,431 --> 00:16:12,380
which I would knock down riding time there
in from you were keeping tabs on her?

275
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,280
Yes, I was.

276
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:16,880
She even went so far as to take $5,000
out of the bank account that they shared

277
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:19,880
by a trailer for them to live in
one that wouldn't move. You know,

278
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:22,520
I was trying try and more
or less to make him do.

279
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:26,570
Right and it seemed like it was
working. But then one night,

280
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,840
Chris came in after work and sat down
in the living room with missy and their

281
00:16:29,841 --> 00:16:34,590
daughter to watch some TV seminar. We
heard loud beaten at the door while,

282
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,350
you know, I jump up and
he jumps up and um, uh,

283
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,420
next thing I know he was, you know,

284
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,740
moving that kitchen table and
sliding it out. Next thing I know,

285
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:48,190
he raises the rug up off the floor and
he jumps down in there and he says,

286
00:16:48,191 --> 00:16:52,720
cover it back up. So I cover it back up,
put the table back and answer the door.

287
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:58,090
And they came in and they walked
all around the house and uh,

288
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,780
and they laughed. So you,

289
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:05,980
I bought this house to keep him still
and he'd cut a trap door in it. Yep.

290
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,040
He stayed up on his fighter the whole
time they were walking over top of him.

291
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,880
Wow. Yeah. I guess it was
more or less I was young,

292
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,700
I knowed but I was also in denial.

293
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:19,210
But eventually something happened that
kind of forced her to admit just how bad

294
00:17:19,211 --> 00:17:21,580
things had gotten with
Kris day before Halloween,

295
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,660
Danielle and her daddy had went down to
Walmart and she had picked out a little,

296
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:29,290
which outfit, but she was old enough
and they don't, you know, she was four,

297
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:32,650
you know, trick or treating for a
four year old. That was a big thing.

298
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,100
The next morning it's Halloween. Her
daddy looked at her and said, what baby,

299
00:17:36,101 --> 00:17:40,750
I'm going to work. Um, I'll
say this afternoon, you know,

300
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:41,680
I'll get home. Well,

301
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,010
get you outfit on you and we'll go
trick or treating up in Nashville.

302
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,900
And that afternoon,

303
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:49,980
Danielle was sitting on the back step and
then she just sitting there in a white

304
00:17:49,981 --> 00:17:53,400
tee shirt and I asked her,
I said, Danielle, what are
you doing? How about no,

305
00:17:53,401 --> 00:17:55,200
my daddy get home mama? He said,

306
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:59,220
we're gonna go Nashville and we're going
to go trick or treating. I said, okay,

307
00:17:59,221 --> 00:18:02,670
he'll be back in a little bit. And
she sat there and she sat there

308
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,930
and um, he never came home that night.

309
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,620
You? Um, I don't really hear like,

310
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:22,290
I don't hear a lot of bitterness
from you. No. Is that accurate?

311
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,800
Yes. Why? What?

312
00:18:25,801 --> 00:18:29,730
As far as me being upset with
Chris or hating Cruz? Yes ma'am.

313
00:18:29,731 --> 00:18:31,530
Is that what you're asking me? Yes ma'am.

314
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,720
How could you not forgive Chris? 18 years.

315
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:42,440
That's how long I've known that boy and
I have seen firsthand where he lived,

316
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:47,760
how he lived. I'm a fighter.

317
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:52,440
I go to church, my kids go to
church. I learned to forgive people.

318
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,430
And Chris has had a hard
life. He needs help.

319
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,680
Help that I can't give him

320
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,040
[inaudible]

321
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,970
you thought for a while that you
could give him that help? Yes, it is.

322
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:14,950
[inaudible]

323
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,720
I should have been there for my
kids. Yeah, they take a lifetime.

324
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm making this up. Yeah. You
know, I'm making up what are done

325
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:22,960
[inaudible]

326
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,490
so what do you make of this story, Ben?

327
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,080
Well, somewhere along the
way for Ben and I, this,

328
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,890
this story really became
about the symbol question.

329
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,760
Can a person like Chris, you
know, grew up the way he did?

330
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,180
Can a person like that change

331
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,140
or do you just never escape
the childhood like that?

332
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:46,650
People live with a how they grew up? Yes.

333
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:51,750
Miskiw she says if two kids and a wife
that he loves, if we can stopping.

334
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,020
I don't know what can, but
when we asked Chris, he said,

335
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,570
it's in my mind I going to change it
on our own. They're going to change.

336
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:02,100
I'm working to change. Really. Of course
he has said that before. Truthfully,

337
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,680
what's different this time? What?

338
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,160
W you know I'm doing places I don't have
to take up taking every one of them.

339
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:11,280
I'm taking her anger. I'm
taking how to be a better daddy.

340
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm taking everything about if that will
knock them off for pro this month I'm

341
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,730
going to, I asked him can I go home a
complete another non what for? Wait,

342
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,210
is he saying he's going to ask
them to keep him in jail? Yeah.

343
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,960
The 20 years of running, he's asking
the parole board not to let him go,

344
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:31,620
which made me think, I don't know.
Maybe. And then what do you think?

345
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,240
I don't think there's any way

346
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,450
that Chris changes. I
think he's, you know,

347
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:45,130
unfortunately doomed to stay
in the cycle, which sucks.

348
00:20:45,131 --> 00:20:50,100
You know, I'm sort of ashamed
that I have that opinion. Why?

349
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,200
I mean, why do you think
you feel that way? I,

350
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:59,260
I mean my dad was pretty
similar to Chris in many ways.

351
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:04,120
Really. My father abandoned
me, uh, when I was,

352
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:07,360
when I was a young boy and, um,

353
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:12,430
and I got reacquainted with him when
I was a teenager. At that point.

354
00:21:12,431 --> 00:21:16,660
He was, um, very sad alcoholic,

355
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:20,520
uh, who often made big mistakes and,

356
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:25,810
and I played high school
football and near the end of the,

357
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,380
of the year, my senior year,
they put out this highlight tape.

358
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:33,700
So I took that highlight tape to
his trailer in Slick Oklahoma.

359
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,750
And after shooting a lot of Tequila,

360
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,010
we sat down on the couch together and
I put the tape in and we were watching,

361
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,690
you know, watching me
play football. And, um,

362
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,380
not long into it. My Dad
starts sobbing, just bawling,

363
00:21:50,381 --> 00:21:54,640
tears running down his face. And I
look over at him and, uh, and he says,

364
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,510
I wish I could have been there and

365
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:05,190
I wanted nothing more in that
moment and today than to ask him,

366
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,910
why weren't you? And, um,

367
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,070
I think in some way

368
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,970
I get that opportunity in this
job to ask my dad that question.

369
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,050
Ben Says, his dad never
answered that question.

370
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,220
And after that day where they watched
that football tape, nothing changed.

371
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,970
Ben got Older, he graduated from
college, got married, had kids,

372
00:22:31,971 --> 00:22:35,480
and his dad never showed up
for any of it. So he says,

373
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,040
when he's talking to a guy like Chris,

374
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,230
in some ways, I, I, you know,

375
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:42,590
I'm sitting across the
table from my own father,

376
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,300
which doesn't give him a lot of hope.

377
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:47,360
The only ounce of encouragement
that I have, honestly,

378
00:22:47,361 --> 00:22:52,100
is if we find out that,
that Chris has indeed a,

379
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:56,330
when given the chance to get
out of jail, said, no thank you.

380
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,610
Maybe that gives me an ounce of hope.

381
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:05,140
And a couple of weeks ago,
Ben got a letter from Chris.

382
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,070
Can you just, uh, can you read it for me?

383
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:13,010
Yeah. Uh,

384
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:17,990
he says, dear Mr. Montgomery,
thank you for your letter.

385
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,400
I'm doing well.

386
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:25,730
I went up for parole and yes, I did ask
them to let me go through the program.

387
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:30,500
The final decision was to parole
me upon completion of the program.

388
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:35,740
I would complete it on October 4th, 2012

389
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:43,190
so he's staying well, I
better get this in the mail.

390
00:23:44,830 --> 00:23:48,280
Thank again for writing. I
hope to hear from you again.

391
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,380
Your friend Christopher Daniel Gay.

392
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,713
Hmm.

00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,720
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab and today

424
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:07,940
we offer you as, hey

425
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:11,470
talking about escape stories about people
being trapped and then getting out and

426
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,480
getting free. And in our last
segment we met a guy, uh,

427
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,170
for whom will the escape
itself became a trap.

428
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:21,950
But now we're going to take our escape
Motif to a much bigger scale. Yeah.

429
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,350
And we're calling this, by the way,

430
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,550
the outer limit because in this one we're
going to the outer limits of the human

431
00:26:27,551 --> 00:26:32,160
imagination began for us when we spoke
with this writer. Yes, I hear you.

432
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,980
And Dolnick is his name. And
he told us a story about,

433
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,070
so this is Isaac Newton's
story for the most part.

434
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:42,550
And it's a story that involves the
Earth, the heavens, God, humanity.

435
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,040
And you might as well throw in the

436
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,873
apple. Um,

437
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:49,620
the one thing everybody knows about Newton
is that an apple fell from a tree and

438
00:26:49,621 --> 00:26:52,830
bonked him on the head, which
isn't true. I was told, right.

439
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:56,820
That isn't an apocryphal.
It's probably not true, but,

440
00:26:56,821 --> 00:27:00,620
but it's a story that Newton himself
told. Oh, really? Because Newton,

441
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:04,130
according to Ed all his life had this
notion that he was different from other

442
00:27:04,131 --> 00:27:08,870
people. Uh, not only different from, but
better. Uh, he had a pipeline to God.

443
00:27:08,871 --> 00:27:12,360
God was whispering secrets, the
secrets of creation into his ear. Uh,

444
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,810
no one else had been blessed in this way.

445
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:18,590
Other people's role in life was
simply to, uh, to bog him down.

446
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:23,330
Not what I would call the most
modest guy now, but at any rate,

447
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,590
what our story begins around
1665, Newton is at Cambridge.

448
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:30,200
He's a student in Cambridge,
is hit by the plague.

449
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,620
They send everybody home because although
nobody understands how the disease

450
00:27:33,621 --> 00:27:37,650
works, they know that, uh, if people
are crowded together, they tend to, uh,

451
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,490
to all get it. So, so everybody
go your separate ways.

452
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:43,520
This was a kind of an enforced
summer vacation, right?

453
00:27:43,521 --> 00:27:46,580
And He's like 19 or 20 at
this point in 21, 22, okay.

454
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,460
Newton goes home to his
mother's farm. Mom's like, cool,

455
00:27:49,461 --> 00:27:53,480
now you can help me on the farm. But
he says, no, because he has a plan.

456
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,830
He'd brought some books home,

457
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:59,780
a bunch of of textbooks and he locks
himself in his room and sets himself not

458
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,300
only to having mastered all the
science that had ever been done,

459
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:06,130
but two plunging on ahead
of everyone else on his own,

460
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,140
motivated by this religious faith that
everything in the universe was set up by

461
00:28:10,141 --> 00:28:15,080
a god who wanted someone to crack the
code. Newton believes he's the one in.

462
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,490
Was He doing in his room?

463
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:20,000
I mean was he that that just sitting
there and like with a thousand giant

464
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:23,330
textbooks, all that's
known is that he did this.

465
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:26,600
He just went into his room and
came out with what we're about.

466
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:31,610
He came out with with the how gravity
works, how light works, how rainbows work,

467
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:35,690
how the tides work, and then having
done all summer, he did all this.

468
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:40,040
What did you do on your summer vacation
jet. I know Mike, my summer I am,

469
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,690
I learned how to fold sheets like Marines,
which I thought was pretty good too.

470
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:48,990
So after having that, I mean

471
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,240
one flash of insight after another.

472
00:28:51,241 --> 00:28:54,990
Newton now sets his mind to one
of the great problems of all time,

473
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,710
which for our purposes we will
call the problem of the moon.

474
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:00,750
And just to set this up,

475
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:04,980
what everybody before Newton and
Galileo thought is there are a bunch of

476
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:08,970
ordinary things here on earth like rocks
and they behave in the ordinary way

477
00:29:08,971 --> 00:29:11,040
that we know, you know,
pick up a rock, let go,

478
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:15,570
it falls and there are a bunch of much
more different mysterious, elegant,

479
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,930
perfect things in the sky like
the moon, which doesn't fall,

480
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:20,250
it just flutes there.

481
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,750
So one could conclude that the moon
has its own separate set of laws.

482
00:29:24,751 --> 00:29:27,990
There are one set of laws that work here
on earth and another set that work in

483
00:29:27,991 --> 00:29:31,290
the heavens and there's no reason it
should be the same set of laws any more

484
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:34,860
than New York's laws should be the
same as Paris's laws can make sense.

485
00:29:34,861 --> 00:29:37,770
Actually. Heavenly things
float earthly things fall.

486
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,840
But then here's where the problem begins.

487
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:42,100
Newton and a bunch people at that time had

488
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,520
gotten hold of this new
fangled thing called telescope.

489
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,300
And one of the things they saw was
that the moon wasn't this a mysterious,

490
00:29:50,301 --> 00:29:53,240
a heavenly body that they
seem it was a big rock,

491
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:58,540
a regular lumpy potato wish rock
[inaudible] people were like,

492
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:02,620
Huh, but Newton being of
course Newton thought.

493
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,970
Now wait a second. If the
job of a rock is to fall,

494
00:30:06,210 --> 00:30:10,440
and if the moon is just another rock,
why doesn't it fall down? Exactly. So

495
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,300
what's it doing sitting up
there night after night,

496
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,173
hello?

497
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,450
And it's at this point that Newton
sitting in his room or wherever he was,

498
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:23,780
we can imagine, makes a crazy mental leap.

499
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,650
He thought back to a little thought
experiment. Then Galileo had come up with,

500
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:31,820
which initially might not make much
sense the connection, but it pays off.

501
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,960
And here's the setup.

502
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:38,590
You've got someone standing in a big
field with a gun that he's about to shoot

503
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:43,370
him and next to that person with his
gun. Is it person holding in his hand?

504
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:44,150
A bullet.

505
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:47,360
So you've got a person holding a gun and
a person holding just a bullet side by

506
00:30:47,361 --> 00:30:50,930
side and the bullet in the hand and the
bullet in the gun are exactly the same

507
00:30:50,931 --> 00:30:55,070
height above the ground and
now somebody says, ready, aim,

508
00:30:55,071 --> 00:30:58,580
fire eight. At the instant he
says fire the man with the gun,

509
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,060
shoots that bullet horizontally
and at that same instant,

510
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,290
the man next to him holding the bullet
in his hand opens his hand and the bullet

511
00:31:06,291 --> 00:31:09,950
drops. So there's one bullet
zipping along, mn falling,

512
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:12,170
and then the other one just falls, right?

513
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:16,400
We shoot the bullet out of the horizontal
gun and we dropped the bullet from

514
00:31:16,401 --> 00:31:18,110
right decks to the guy
at the same time. Yes,

515
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,390
both bullets will hit
the ground eventually,

516
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:23,660
but when they do they'll be far
apart. And Galileo's riddle was,

517
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,800
which of those bullets hits the

518
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,630
ground first? Well,

519
00:31:27,631 --> 00:31:30,720
I mean everybody would know that the one
that would hit the ground first and the

520
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:34,880
one that you just dropped because the
other one has to go all that. This is,

521
00:31:35,010 --> 00:31:38,480
this is, this is a hard drill
and the answer is what? Wait.

522
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:39,630
Why is it such a hard riddle?

523
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:42,090
Because I would think that the bullet
you drop is just going to hit first.

524
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,860
The guns got to go all the way. No,

525
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:47,410
those two bullets both hit the ground.

526
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,780
The exact same incident.

527
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:52,540
Really that's, that's
an experimental fact.

528
00:31:52,541 --> 00:31:55,480
The bullet from the gun and the bullet
and things lands at the same time.

529
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,610
This bullet that shot horizontally,

530
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,270
it doesn't go like Wiley Coyote running
off a cliff. It doesn't go straight,

531
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:05,500
shoot straight, straight and then
fall. It's curving as it goes.

532
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:09,250
And the thing that causes it to curve
as it goes of course, is gravity.

533
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:13,690
It's the same gravity that is pulling
the bullet that you drop. Same gravity,

534
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:17,980
same pole, same speed.
So counterintuitively,

535
00:32:17,981 --> 00:32:20,140
when you drop a bullet and
it falls for this long,

536
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:24,270
when you fire the gun, it'll
also fall for that long.

537
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,180
Even though ends up a mile away.

538
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,370
See, that was Galloway was riddle and
that's as far as Galileo took it. Yeah.

539
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,710
Newton looked at that and
he said something smart.

540
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,980
Whoa. First thing you said is,

541
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,000
okay, this field,

542
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:45,650
let's not pretend that this is some
perfectly flat field that goes on forever.

543
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:49,000
No, we're on the earth
and the earth is round in.

544
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:53,840
What roundness means is that the
ground curves away below horizontal.

545
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:57,860
So really what's happening is that as
the bullet is shooting across the field

546
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:58,820
and falling to the earth,

547
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:03,560
the earth at the same time is very
gradually curving away from it.

548
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:06,320
Now of course, most guns, you know,

549
00:33:06,321 --> 00:33:09,230
they don't shoot the bullet very
far and at that short distance,

550
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:13,310
the field is still pretty much flat.
But here's what Newton thought.

551
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,420
What if you could find just the right
gun that could shoot that bullet,

552
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:20,600
not just across the field but
across like thousands of miles.

553
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,850
And what if as it falls,

554
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:27,880
that bullet curves down towards the earth
in just the same way as the earth is

555
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:32,290
curving away from it. In this
scenario, the bullet that we've shot,

556
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,090
we'll keep falling and
falling and falling,

557
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,180
but the earth keeps falling and falling
and falling away from the bullet.

558
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:40,600
So the bullet falls forever.
The earth curves forever.

559
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,280
The picture never changes.

560
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:46,270
So the bullet then does what the bullet,

561
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,563
he's in orbit

562
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,463
[inaudible]

563
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:55,260
hundreds of years before
Sputnik and other satellites.

564
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,900
Newton has invented the satellite.

565
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:06,090
And on top of that he said when we see
rocks like the moon that are not falling,

566
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:12,190
the reason we think they're not falling
is because we misunderstand really just

567
00:34:12,191 --> 00:34:17,191
as the gun launched a bullet on earth
and it goes and never false god who was

568
00:34:17,381 --> 00:34:22,381
presumably a terrifically strong pitcher
launched the moon around the earth at

569
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:29,110
just such a rate that that would
continue in its circle around us forever.

570
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,360
This is a perpetual dance.

571
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:36,520
The partners are bound together but they
never come close and they never break

572
00:34:36,521 --> 00:34:40,400
up either. It's this endless round,

573
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,400
round round

574
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,610
from which there is no the scheme.

575
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,070
What this does,

576
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:53,420
what Newton did is take the
moon out of the domain of, of,

577
00:34:53,421 --> 00:34:56,400
of poets and, and, and,
uh, musicians, the,

578
00:34:56,401 --> 00:35:01,401
the golden or in this kind of thing and
last Sobek to the same news that we use

579
00:35:04,011 --> 00:35:07,850
here on earth. In other words, what
he showed is it in a very real way,

580
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,660
there's no separation
between us and the heavens.

581
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,000
The same set of laws
does govern everything.

582
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:16,820
It's one universe and
I've explained it all.

583
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,910
Once you figure out the
laws of gravitation,

584
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,420
then you can send spacecraft to

585
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:33,360
Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, anywhere out there.

586
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:37,980
If you're a radio lab

587
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,880
listener from way back, you
might recognize that voice.
That's Andrew Williams.

588
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:45,900
One of the first stories we did actually
I interviewed her about working on the

589
00:35:45,901 --> 00:35:48,750
famous uh, golden record.
You remember this? Sure.

590
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,320
So the idea at the time was to put
this record on the voyage or capsule,

591
00:35:52,321 --> 00:35:53,250
send it in the space.

592
00:35:53,251 --> 00:35:56,890
And on the record would be all of these
sounds that represented, you know,

593
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,630
us kiss a mother's first words,

594
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,480
your newborn baby. Come on now.

595
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,160
In any case,

596
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:12,310
Ann was the one who was in charge of
choosing all the sounds to put onto that

597
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:16,840
record. She and Carl Sagan work together
on that project. And here's the thing,

598
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,710
we stopped our story as
the rockets took off,

599
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,720
but obviously that was just
the beginning of the story.

600
00:36:22,721 --> 00:36:27,721
And the voyager capsules right now are
about to make a kind of escape that

601
00:36:28,631 --> 00:36:30,370
Newton could have only dreamed of.

602
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,890
Okay. So record thing. And uh, our
producer limb levy has been, sorry,

603
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,950
I just turned my headphones off way
too. I've been following this story.

604
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:42,730
Oh yeah, you just turn it down. Yeah.
Okay. So it can pick it up. Where we, uh,

605
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,321
left. Okay.

606
00:36:43,321 --> 00:36:47,640
So like in the point of the mission
wasn't really to deliver this record,

607
00:36:47,641 --> 00:36:51,720
it was to go out and look at all the
planets in the outer solar system.

608
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:56,340
So starting in 1977, these two
little spaceships to spacecraft,

609
00:36:56,341 --> 00:37:00,450
voyager one and two went racing
away from Earth snapping pictures.

610
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:04,910
And so every time before you actually
would reach another planet, you know,

611
00:37:04,911 --> 00:37:08,480
all of the voyager people would
get together, go into the imaging

612
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:13,510
room and see the pictures come
from the outer solar system.

613
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,680
Do you remember seeing them? I remember
as a child seeing life magazine,

614
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,440
you know, I was seven when
[inaudible] was launched.

615
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:24,970
So this is [inaudible] author,
professor at Boston University.

616
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:28,180
As a grown up, she became part of the
voyager team. All the pictures that,

617
00:37:28,181 --> 00:37:31,900
you know, as a kid, you look at the
books and to see what, how Napkin,

618
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,930
look how Jupiter local,

619
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,970
you know, just incomplete
revelations. Saturn,

620
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,570
the image of Saturn technique
color like pink and like reddish,

621
00:37:41,571 --> 00:37:46,370
Turquoise, color yellow. And
those rings just spectacular.

622
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,240
They could see active volcanoes on
one of the moons of Jupiter. Finally,

623
00:37:50,241 --> 00:37:51,980
that vision of Neptune,

624
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:56,960
this blue jewel, really blue,

625
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:01,120
it's all came from voyager. We had no
idea how they look like before voyager.

626
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:06,110
Neptune was the last big cool planet
and it was the last thing they were

627
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:08,060
supposed to photograph after that, right.

628
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,020
The cameras were going to be
shut off till save energy.

629
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:16,180
But Carl Sagan convinced them to turn on
voyager back to earth and take a final

630
00:38:17,201 --> 00:38:21,580
picture. So on Valentine's Day, 1990, uh,

631
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,580
one of the ships slowly rotated
so it was facing back to earth

632
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,503
and

633
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:34,190
it snapped a picture. One
last picture. Describe it.

634
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,003
So

635
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:40,830
it's mostly empty. Um,

636
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,430
it's, it's pretty dark.

637
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:46,210
You can see sort of streaks
of light coming from the sun

638
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,613
and then

639
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,470
you honestly wouldn't notice it
if it wasn't pointed out to you,

640
00:38:50,471 --> 00:38:55,200
but down in one corner, kind
of a suspended in a sun beam.

641
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,900
The rays are very small. Dot Blue,

642
00:38:58,090 --> 00:39:03,090
a pale blue dot that with
us in Carl sagans words,

643
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:07,480
everyone you ever knew, everyone
you ever loved, every superstar,

644
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:12,900
every corrupt politician, just everyone
in all of history, everything is.

645
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,940
Some total think of
the rivers isn't blind,

646
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:24,610
so that one indistinguishable group
could have momentary domination over a

647
00:39:27,021 --> 00:39:28,610
fraction of that pixel.

648
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:33,560
It was one of those really
rare images every single day.

649
00:39:33,561 --> 00:39:38,561
I hear from people who take that
Pale blue.so deeply to heart.

650
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:44,010
It was, it was a complete reframing
after that, they come out of a off,

651
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,920
but here's the thing. The
ships kept going, going,

652
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,190
going, going, drifting
through the darkness,

653
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:57,130
going, going, going.

654
00:39:57,430 --> 00:39:59,400
Even though they weren't
taking pictures anymore,

655
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,630
they were using like their other senses,

656
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:04,930
little instruments that detect
like how many particles are around,

657
00:40:04,931 --> 00:40:05,950
what the temperature is,

658
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:09,850
so they were hurdling through this
empty space really fast. Measuring,

659
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,340
sending that data back and scientists
like that off where they're listening and

660
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,380
waiting for what was not clear,

661
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,920
but they knew at some point these
capsules would get to the edge,

662
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:25,660
the edge of what? The solar system,
the solar system has an edge.

663
00:40:25,661 --> 00:40:28,900
I thought it was just a big spiral. Has
an edge. It's a, it's like a bubble.

664
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,060
C The Sun has a wind.

665
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:35,230
Every star has a wing,

666
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:39,100
but the sun has its own wind that
blows out through the solar system.

667
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,180
It's very fast.

668
00:40:40,290 --> 00:40:45,290
It can be between 400 to 800
kilometers per second anyway.

669
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:49,730
It blows out from the sun
past all the planets and uh,

670
00:40:50,050 --> 00:40:54,490
it keeps everything else out. Oh, so it's
like one up a balloon. Yeah, exactly.

671
00:40:54,491 --> 00:40:55,810
The wind gives it a shape, right?

672
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:59,110
So these little things are cruising
out towards this edge, wherever it is.

673
00:40:59,140 --> 00:41:01,600
Scientists don't quite know
where it is or what it is.

674
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:04,580
The guys in the control room are like
pegging the ships. Like, Hey, what's,

675
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,090
what's up? What do you see? Well,
the ships are like nothing. Well,

676
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,690
how about now? Not much. No. Nothing.

677
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,500
And how long before they actually
see something. 14 years. Oh Man.

678
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:18,540
It's like driving through Kansas
but like a million times. Right.

679
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:23,810
But there comes a day end of 2004 where
they stopped listening for a little

680
00:41:25,051 --> 00:41:26,310
while because the antenna,

681
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,680
NASA only has so many antennas and
they have to use them to listen to

682
00:41:28,681 --> 00:41:31,680
everything. So for a little while
the voyager teams like, okay,

683
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:33,990
you guys over there can
use the antennas. We're

684
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,000
going to lunch. Yeah. I mean
it's not like anything's happen.

685
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,430
Nothing's happening anyway.
It's been 14 goddamn years.

686
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,770
[inaudible] yourself out guys. It's cool.
And they come back a few hours later,

687
00:41:42,771 --> 00:41:45,120
start listening again and

688
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,790
it's happened. Very southern.
Everything is totally changed really.

689
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:51,890
All of a sudden, boom.

690
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,660
The speed of the wind dropped from
around three 80 kilometers per second

691
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,380
to a hundred instantly, like
just all at once intently.

692
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:06,350
And then everything out there
started to get messy. Very Tall,

693
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,380
much metoprolol. And
before particles are also

694
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,890
behaving a very different way

695
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,690
and the fields are very, um, we are

696
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:30,940
the fields. Am I kinetic field?
So just like the sun has a wind,

697
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:32,710
the sun has a magnetic field as well.

698
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:36,400
The field starts at the sun and then
curves out in this kind of graceful arc

699
00:42:36,401 --> 00:42:39,760
through the solar system
and the how the sun rotates,

700
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,840
create what people call [inaudible] cart.

701
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:46,170
You know how like a skirt will
flair if you spin around real fast.

702
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,020
[inaudible] that's apparently kind
of what this field looks like.

703
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:53,370
But way out there, it seemed like
the skirt had started to fray,

704
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:56,250
maybe tear a little threads,

705
00:42:56,251 --> 00:42:59,280
had broken off and seem to be
floating around on their own.

706
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:03,570
Not connected to anything. So
what does this all mean? I mean,

707
00:43:03,571 --> 00:43:08,160
if the fields are breaking down and the
wind is dying down and you said the wind

708
00:43:08,161 --> 00:43:10,650
is what actually creates the
space of the solar system.

709
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,390
Does this mean we're out to no,

710
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:17,140
I kind of thought that was what was
happening. But no, it's not out.

711
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:19,240
And it's not quite in,

712
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:25,200
it's in the edge of the
bubble. It's in the air. Yeah.

713
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,590
But it's not like, I'm not like a
little thin edge. It's a, it's a thick,

714
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,910
thick edge. All right.

715
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,800
So the edge isn't just a little
line that you cross at the place.

716
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:35,050
Yeah, and while we listened,

717
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:39,370
the two voyager ships moved through
this edge for several years.

718
00:43:42,790 --> 00:43:45,520
Zen. Something very
interesting happen. Um,

719
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:48,180
is that the weaned on virgin [inaudible]

720
00:43:50,190 --> 00:43:53,730
stopped like completely stopped. Yeah.

721
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,520
So now we're out. No, no.

722
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,760
I mean this is what people thought.

723
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:03,900
But the other measurements like
temperature and number of particles,

724
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:06,840
the magnetic field doesn't tell
us that we are out of the Bible.

725
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,940
Nature surprised us again.

726
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,970
So now we think there's a place
at the edge of our solar system.

727
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,580
Why didn't they add
Angie edge of the edge?

728
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:18,840
That's utterly still no
wind at all. A pause.

729
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,150
People are Connie stagnation layer.

730
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,063
Okay.

731
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:28,120
There is a big discussion why this layer
exist and how thick it is and by how

732
00:44:28,611 --> 00:44:32,040
thick it is, she means
when will it end? Because

733
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,590
once we get past this, who has
anything ever crossed this,

734
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,620
the boundary before? No.

735
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:41,710
This will be the first manmade object
to live any star and a voyager is like

736
00:44:45,621 --> 00:44:48,280
right there smelling, touching
that boundary. You know,

737
00:44:48,370 --> 00:44:50,450
you only do those things first. Once

738
00:44:51,260 --> 00:44:54,500
like your first kiss, your
first taste of alcohol,

739
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,910
your first time driving a car.
The first time you see the ocean.

740
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,220
Oh,

741
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,270
these things open up a whole new world.

742
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:05,480
First time out of the solar system.

743
00:45:06,730 --> 00:45:07,010
Aw.

744
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,150
So when is it going to freaking happen?

745
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:10,510
It might have happened
while we were talking. Yeah.

746
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,330
We're thinking from now. Any moment now.

747
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:16,510
Next couple of months or three
years from now, four years from now.

748
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,413
It's close.

749
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,120
Every day opened my Google alert for
voyager and I look and see did it happen

750
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:27,030
today? If it happens before the show
goes out? I'm really pissed. Yeah.

751
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:30,740
Every day. That's the first thing
you do in the morning. Oh, alright.

752
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:31,993
Like the third thing

753
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:47,330
[inaudible] [inaudible]

754
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:50,230
all right, so quick update. In 2013, uh,

755
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:55,231
NASA announced that voyager one had
finally left the heliosphere but it turns

756
00:45:56,471 --> 00:45:58,870
out it is really hard to tell for sure.

757
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:03,550
And scientists are still debating whether
it is in or whether it is out or you

758
00:46:03,551 --> 00:46:04,660
can find out more about that

Hey, I'm Janet. Boom, run.
I remember [inaudible].

777
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:08,590
This is Radiolab and today we're
talking about the escape scan.

778
00:47:08,870 --> 00:47:09,980
In this last story,

779
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,540
I have a feeling that this guy
actually does kind of make it through.

780
00:47:14,541 --> 00:47:17,660
This is a true, I think
he does honest escape,

781
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:22,450
but he does it in the most
original and most unusual way here,

782
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,700
where the story is our producer Sean Cole.

783
00:47:24,850 --> 00:47:28,780
So the story starts in the late fifties
there was this little boy in Richmond

784
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,040
named Joe and Aggressi a junior.
He's seven or eight years old,

785
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:37,870
and he's just sitting at home dialing
various numbers on his parents' telephone

786
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:41,890
just to see what happens. He was on
a long distance call to information,

787
00:47:41,891 --> 00:47:44,470
you know, five, five, five one two
one two, one to just scenario code.

788
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:48,070
This is Phil Lapsley. I first heard
Joe's story from him and he heard it

789
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:49,930
very faintly in the background, the tone,

790
00:47:49,931 --> 00:47:51,520
and you just started
whistling along with it.

791
00:47:53,780 --> 00:47:55,990
All of a sudden he heard a critique

792
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,280
and the call went away and it turns out
that the tone in the background of the

793
00:48:00,281 --> 00:48:04,330
phone and his corresponding
whistle was 2,600 hertz.

794
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,320
Musically it's about seventh [inaudible].
So he has perfect pitch. Yeah.

795
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:11,110
And he was weirdly smart as you'll soon

796
00:48:12,050 --> 00:48:14,450
discover anyway, he thinks to
himself. That's very odd. Well,

797
00:48:14,451 --> 00:48:17,150
that happened once. I wonder if
it'd happen again. Does it again?

798
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,120
You didn't even really know exactly
what it was at the time, but he does it.

799
00:48:20,121 --> 00:48:20,180
Yeah.

800
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:22,100
Again, and again,

801
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,320
you didn't think it was
particularly useful for anything.

802
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:30,350
He does talk about walking past somebody
at a pay phone when he was seven or

803
00:48:30,391 --> 00:48:34,290
eight years old and whistling this tone
and having the phone and the phone call,

804
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:38,220
disconnect on the person. Wow. That's
amazing. Super power. That really is.

805
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:40,830
Yeah. Which means he could
be a little walking bomb.

806
00:48:41,070 --> 00:48:44,010
He could go to grand central station
where there many people sitting in phone

807
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:47,010
booths and does, he could make them
all lose their phone calls. Yeah.

808
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:50,880
And no one would know. Right. But it
was more than just a cool trick for him.

809
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:56,370
This discovery was the
beginning of a kind of escape.

810
00:48:58,450 --> 00:49:02,720
What were you scared of when you
were a little, I bet something

811
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:10,260
scared me. I don't
remember how old I was, but

812
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,310
it's all we have left of him. In fact,

813
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:17,580
he died in 2007 but he left behind hours
and hours of recordings of his voice

814
00:49:18,401 --> 00:49:20,520
phone recordings. And
as he listened to them

815
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,440
that was afraid, you know,

816
00:49:22,441 --> 00:49:24,750
something might have like
grown out of the bed and went,

817
00:49:24,751 --> 00:49:26,590
found the button on the floor and

818
00:49:27,430 --> 00:49:31,210
you pretty quickly realized that the
little boy in that room who was playing

819
00:49:31,211 --> 00:49:33,660
with the phone and he
was kind of desperate,

820
00:49:34,570 --> 00:49:37,540
he went to this Catholic school
for the blind was his mind.

821
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,270
He was born blind and when he was there

822
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:42,520
in the fall of 1955,

823
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:43,540
things got pretty bad.

824
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:47,970
A lot of the nuns, uh, me and
my sister really hard, you know,

825
00:49:47,971 --> 00:49:52,260
and took us only one that will abuse.

826
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,420
She used to have me get on the table,

827
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,620
then she would get up on
the table and lie down.

828
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:01,530
[inaudible] the bad touching

829
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,190
things were pretty bad at home too.

830
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:08,290
Daddy would slam mother and hurt her and
break things and lots of scary sounds

831
00:50:09,531 --> 00:50:14,531
and stuff at night that has my
phone up close with the dial tone.

832
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:21,793
[inaudible]

833
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,490
I'm on the dial tone.
That was always there.

834
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:28,070
It's a nice warm tone. It never yelled

835
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:28,963
at, never fought.

836
00:50:28,970 --> 00:50:30,790
What a wonderful thing of telephone in.

837
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,960
Well, just a nice way for
him to comfort himself

838
00:50:37,420 --> 00:50:38,253
those long nights.

839
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,253
[inaudible]

840
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:45,350
and so how did exactly did the,
the whistling thing he was doing,

841
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,190
how did that help him?

842
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,800
It takes a few steps to explain,

843
00:50:49,801 --> 00:50:54,801
but it turns out that that tone was the
key word in a hidden mechanical language

844
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,240
that controlled the phone system.

845
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:58,523
Hmm.

846
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,420
He wasn't supposed to be able
to hear it at all. In fact,

847
00:51:00,421 --> 00:51:04,080
it was an internal signal probably
bleeding over from another line.

848
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:08,100
And when a long distance line was
idle, when there was no call on it,

849
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,140
this tone would be being
played continuously.

850
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,540
Basically the tone means that the line
is free and silence on the line means

851
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:18,440
there's someone trying to make a call.

852
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:23,030
So say you're in New York and you want
to call La, you pick up your phone,

853
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,000
the circuit's got this tone on it
and marking the circuit is idle,

854
00:51:26,150 --> 00:51:27,320
dial the La number.

855
00:51:27,321 --> 00:51:30,740
And at that point your line takes
away the tune for just a moment.

856
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:33,500
It goes silent. And La goes, AH,

857
00:51:34,470 --> 00:51:37,950
New York wants to make a phone call and
then la drops its tone and the New York

858
00:51:37,951 --> 00:51:39,270
and La machines talk to each other.

859
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:45,100
So that's one discovery.

860
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:48,790
Another discovery is that you can dial
a phone by just having the hook switch,

861
00:51:48,791 --> 00:51:52,810
that little button where you hang up,
tap that three times delta number three,

862
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:55,090
seven times, dial the number seven.

863
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:58,120
And so then Jo thought we pulses tones.

864
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:02,920
Maybe if you were to make a little
bursts of a tone. So something like

865
00:52:07,310 --> 00:52:09,390
Joel's demonstrated on a web
show called hacks or radio,

866
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,930
you were nine. If you were
to do something like that,

867
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,700
maybe you can actually dial a call

868
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,610
and you could actually make it.

869
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:24,480
That's exactly how the phone system
used to send calls back and forth.

870
00:52:24,540 --> 00:52:28,140
That was its language. That's right.
Joe Learned how to speak telephone,

871
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:30,440
which was amazing. I mean,
I think that's amazing. Um,

872
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:34,470
but isn't he just dialing the phone
with his lips as opposed to using his

873
00:52:34,471 --> 00:52:36,060
fingers? Yes, true.

874
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:41,120
But Joe made one more little discovery
that would change his life forever.

875
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,130
So yeah,

876
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:46,660
if you first dialed a a number like
long distance information, five, five,

877
00:52:46,661 --> 00:52:47,890
five one, two, one, two.

878
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,820
The telephone company doesn't
charge for call for information.

879
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:54,220
So what he figured out was that once
you get the operator on the line,

880
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,310
if you then whistled to disconnect
but only for a little bit,

881
00:52:57,790 --> 00:53:00,940
only for a second or two,
the line nearly disconnects,

882
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:02,350
but it doesn't all the way.

883
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:07,810
It just sits in this kind of limbo waiting
for instructions waiting to be used.

884
00:53:07,811 --> 00:53:09,670
Huh. And you can

885
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:14,420
the route your call by whistling the
digits and wanted to dial and make a free

886
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:17,840
call because the phone company again
thinks that you're still connected to

887
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,940
information and it's not
charging you for that.

888
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:26,430
He was like having an unlimited
plane ticket to anywhere Joe

889
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,670
could call anywhere he wanted for free.

890
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:33,270
Come coming up and explore
the number you have.

891
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:34,910
Code is not connected to listening

892
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,900
and so he started calling
all over the world,

893
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:43,920
even broken number numbers just
to hear the different voices.

894
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:46,200
I'm going to be cold calling that gang.

895
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,710
I used to do this by
the way. Did you really?

896
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,130
My sister and I would get on the phone
where you could call information that was

897
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:55,070
a free service. Yeah. And
we said, hello information.

898
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:56,900
Can you please contact us with Toronto?

899
00:53:56,960 --> 00:54:00,230
And then we get the Toronto operator and
let me say [inaudible] could you please

900
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:03,860
get us in comp project with Churchill
Ontario, which was way up north.

901
00:54:04,130 --> 00:54:05,300
Then the Trisha lady
would come on and I'd say,

902
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:06,770
can you please put us in charge with

903
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:12,530
[inaudible] York intuit place and made
the transfer you to the northern spice.

904
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,640
We would be talking to a person
in the Arctic for nothing. Wow.

905
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:19,280
It was the sense of going
long distance for free.

906
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:22,580
Now imagine you're a blind kid
doing that in an abusive home.

907
00:54:22,610 --> 00:54:25,730
You can't even run away. I think
the phone represented freedom.

908
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:31,060
Um, it represented a place
that was under his control.

909
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,400
He can be an expert in
it, you know, it was,

910
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:36,430
it was a place that he could do all
sorts of things that maybe he wasn't so

911
00:54:36,431 --> 00:54:38,020
easily able to do in real life.

912
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:39,770
[inaudible]

913
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:40,790
so what happens next?

914
00:54:40,850 --> 00:54:43,640
So things get a little bit
better for Joe as he gets older.

915
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:45,890
His mom takes him out
of the Catholic school.

916
00:54:45,891 --> 00:54:48,140
Once she finds out that
the nuns are beating him,

917
00:54:48,950 --> 00:54:51,680
he never told his parents
about the sexual abuse.

918
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:54,230
He gets more and more
savvy with the phone.

919
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:58,850
And then finally he goes off
to the University of South
Florida where he starts

920
00:54:58,851 --> 00:54:59,430
showing off.

921
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:00,030
It started out,

922
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:03,130
Joe told a student that he can whistle
her for your phone call and the student

923
00:55:03,131 --> 00:55:04,650
said, no you can't. And
he said, want a bet?

924
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:07,380
So they bet a dollar and Joe whistled
a long distance call for him.

925
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:11,250
And before long there were crowds of
40 kids who were falling them around

926
00:55:11,251 --> 00:55:13,240
wanting to see him do
this parlor trick. And,

927
00:55:13,370 --> 00:55:17,260
and then he whistled up.
This one particular fateful,

928
00:55:17,670 --> 00:55:21,500
I was trying to whistle somebody in New
York, which is area code five one six

929
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:23,740
[inaudible]

930
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:26,770
but instead had wound up in
Canada, which is five one four

931
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:28,750
okay.

932
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,310
You can see if you're whistling calls,

933
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:32,230
you could easily get
off by one or two beeps.

934
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:35,020
So he wound up talking
to an operator in Canada.

935
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,450
And the operator in Canada put
his call through to New York, uh,

936
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,910
but then actually managed to listen to
the call and then the student was talking

937
00:55:42,911 --> 00:55:43,481
about the,

938
00:55:43,481 --> 00:55:47,470
the wizkid who put the call through to
him for him and telephone companies.

939
00:55:47,471 --> 00:55:50,320
Security ended up tracing it back
to a University of South Florida.

940
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:53,880
It was just a gossipy operator
who told on him. Well,

941
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:57,420
gossipy or security conscious depending
on how you view it. Fun Ruining.

942
00:55:57,421 --> 00:55:58,254
That's how I view.

943
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:03,240
So Joe Busted and he nearly gets kicked
out of school and the whole thing causes

944
00:56:03,241 --> 00:56:05,400
just enough of a stir
that people find out.

945
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,590
The local school newspaper wrote an
article about it and it got picked up by a

946
00:56:11,591 --> 00:56:12,424
wire service.

947
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:17,120
Next thing you know there are newspaper
articles and publicity and yeah,

948
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,080
here's the weird thing. As news travels,

949
00:56:19,081 --> 00:56:21,870
did you see this article about the
blind kid in Florida? You can do this.

950
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,040
It turns out Joe wasn't,

951
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:27,010
there were all of these
other June Brosius out there

952
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,820
hacking the phone system to
two one, two, three, nine,

953
00:56:30,821 --> 00:56:32,510
six you know you mean
I'm not the only one.

954
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,600
You mean there are other people
who are interested in this as well?

955
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:36,740
They weren't whistling God, no, no.

956
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:40,330
Some of them would use these little
machines called blue boxes that would make

957
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:41,164
the tones.

958
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:44,980
A couple of kids actually modified a toy
whistle from a box of captain crunch.

959
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:49,630
And because Joe got caught, they all
started to find out about each other.

960
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:54,840
That really ended up being the focal point
for a whole generation of fun fleets.

961
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:58,470
This is NBC nightly news
phone. What phone free

962
00:56:58,530 --> 00:56:59,660
phone freaks will tell you.

963
00:56:59,870 --> 00:57:03,920
Phone freaking began with a blind
young man named Joe and Bresha.

964
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:07,940
One thing he discovered was that
he could whistle his own call.

965
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:09,953
Okay.

966
00:57:10,580 --> 00:57:14,120
And before long people are
actually calling John Garcia
and a network starts to

967
00:57:14,121 --> 00:57:18,440
form n, um, the phone
freak started finding

968
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:22,610
broken, uh, vacant member
recording. So for example,

969
00:57:22,611 --> 00:57:25,940
you dial a nonworking number and you get
the usual telephone company recording.

970
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:27,590
They not working number,

971
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,070
but it turns out some of those were
broken in such a way that the volume level

972
00:57:31,071 --> 00:57:34,070
was very low. And if multiple
people called the same number,

973
00:57:34,071 --> 00:57:38,670
they could talk right now.
Teenage kids would call. Anyway.

974
00:57:38,790 --> 00:57:39,800
It turned into a party line.

975
00:57:40,010 --> 00:57:42,740
Kind of an annoying one because you had
this announcement that was repeating

976
00:57:42,741 --> 00:57:44,040
every 30 seconds. Oh my number.

977
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:47,420
But it's still allowed teenage kids to
talk to one another at the department

978
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,350
I've known. Wow.

979
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:52,460
Oh, so this is it. I mean he
found his tribe basically. Yeah.

980
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,510
And he would call the conference lines
and talk with them about phones and

981
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,960
freaking and everything. But that
really wasn't what he was after.

982
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:01,870
And I think it's an
interesting thing because,

983
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:06,460
so say you're a lonely kid and you start
playing around with the phone or you

984
00:58:06,461 --> 00:58:08,530
start playing around with
scrabble or whatever it is,

985
00:58:08,531 --> 00:58:13,330
you get really obsessed about some thing
right through the magic of that thing.

986
00:58:13,331 --> 00:58:14,650
You end up meeting other people.

987
00:58:15,130 --> 00:58:17,320
You sort of have a choice
to make at that point.

988
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:22,390
Choice one is embraced the
community. Choice two is oh,

989
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:22,990
that size.

990
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:25,210
It's great that there are other
people and I get some stuff from that,

991
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:28,690
but you know, I found this thing,
my telephone, my scrabble set,

992
00:58:28,691 --> 00:58:32,200
whatever it is I'm obsessed by and
I'm still obsessed by it and I,

993
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,640
it seems to me like he'd sort of
made the choice to go for the thing.

994
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,450
It's not that he didn't
like the community,

995
00:58:39,451 --> 00:58:42,630
but he was still searching for something.

996
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:45,660
Esquire magazine, 1971

997
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,670
march of 1971 is when he moved
to Memphis quarter and that month

998
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:52,790
he had done very little long distance
phone freaking from his own phone.

999
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,520
He had begun to apply for a
job with the phone company.

1000
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,570
Yeah. He went there intending to
get a job and be a man as he, yeah,

1001
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,730
and he wanted to stay away from
anything illegal in gressier quote,

1002
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:07,110
any kind of job will do anything as
menial as the most lowly operator.

1003
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,630
That's probably all they'd
give me because I'm blind.

1004
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:13,090
He wanted to be a telephone man. He
wanted to take his lunchbox to work.

1005
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:16,990
He wanted to get a paycheck. He wanted
to be a real person like everybody else.

1006
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:20,260
This is Steven Gip, one of Joe's best
friends. He lived in a couple of places.

1007
00:59:20,261 --> 00:59:22,190
The first one was, you know, just imagine

1008
00:59:22,190 --> 00:59:23,990
skid row. I mean it was, it was, you know,

1009
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:26,690
you woke up one morning when the heat
went out and he stepped on a dead frozen

1010
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:29,660
rack cause he had ended up sleeping
in his coat. I mean you know,

1011
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:33,560
that's all we could afford and uh,
he can't get arrested in Memphis. Uh,

1012
00:59:33,590 --> 00:59:35,450
you know, he can't get
a job to save his life.

1013
00:59:35,451 --> 00:59:40,451
So he decides to get
arrested literally by,

1014
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:43,400
um, doing this very,

1015
00:59:43,401 --> 00:59:48,200
very elaborate public freak where he
gets a bunch of his freaking friends on a

1016
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:51,590
conference call and he starts dialing
up for an embassies like the armed

1017
00:59:51,591 --> 00:59:55,580
services and Moscow like and pretended
that he was calling as a radio host and

1018
00:59:55,581 --> 00:59:59,390
that all of his friends were his studio
audience high. This is, you know,

1019
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,980
so and so from this radio show,

1020
01:00:00,981 --> 01:00:03,260
do you have time to talk and be on
the air with us today? Oh Great.

1021
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,340
Cause he wanted to stay on the phone line
so that the phone company could trace

1022
01:00:07,341 --> 01:00:10,700
him. Cause he was, he says they're
not really speedy, you know,

1023
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:13,250
he wanted to give them a
lot of time to catch them.

1024
01:00:14,090 --> 01:00:17,060
Two weeks later is when he walked out
the door and you know the FBI came up and

1025
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:19,340
said Joseph and Rezia
and why did he do this?

1026
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,860
Cause he was trying to try to get the
phone company pay attention or something.

1027
01:00:21,861 --> 01:00:22,910
That's right. That's right.

1028
01:00:22,940 --> 01:00:25,880
In the hopes that he would
get a free meal in jail or no,

1029
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:28,310
in the hopes that he would get a job
with the phone company. That's right.

1030
01:00:28,370 --> 01:00:32,570
What a weird way to go about
it. And amazingly it worked.

1031
01:00:35,290 --> 01:00:38,280
Really? Yeah. I've got four
job offers, all phone jobs.

1032
01:00:38,310 --> 01:00:41,130
So he got a job at a little independent
Millington telephone company and they

1033
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:42,360
started cleaning telephones.

1034
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:45,810
Anything from cleaning phones to servicing
equipment, any kind of job will do,

1035
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:49,010
but any kind of job wouldn't
do. You really didn't like it.

1036
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:52,400
It's that kind of thing where you
realize your lifelong dream and then you

1037
01:00:52,401 --> 01:00:56,150
think, wait, I can dream anything I want.

1038
01:00:56,151 --> 01:00:57,770
I can dream bigger than this.

1039
01:00:57,830 --> 01:01:02,040
And so in 1975 and 76 whatever,

1040
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:03,800
he moved to Denver, Denver,

1041
01:01:04,250 --> 01:01:07,520
where every dream is in reach paid for
by the committee to promote Denver.

1042
01:01:07,690 --> 01:01:11,210
And he started hobnobbing with all the
telephone guys and go to the public

1043
01:01:11,211 --> 01:01:14,210
utilities commission and that's when
he stopped working for Mountain Bell

1044
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:18,350
Mountain Bell telephone and that's
when he started freaking for the man.

1045
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,610
And so he worked as a
network troubleshooter and
at this point he had such an

1046
01:01:22,611 --> 01:01:26,330
intimate knowledge of all
the little clicks and pops
of the phone system that he

1047
01:01:26,331 --> 01:01:30,980
could tell from those noises what was
going on and we network how your call was

1048
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:31,814
being routed.

1049
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:35,870
There was a problem somewhere along the
line what the problem was and even where

1050
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:39,200
it was. Wow. Strictly from
listening, strictly from listening.

1051
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:43,630
This was listening to the
dial tone times. Nearpod

1052
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:54,530
[inaudible]

1053
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:55,540
no one should go through

1054
01:01:56,570 --> 01:02:00,740
and he demonstrated his powers on the
New York radio station. WBAI there was,

1055
01:02:00,840 --> 01:02:02,330
there was a show called off the hook.

1056
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,800
Okay, good old bang.

1057
01:02:07,610 --> 01:02:11,000
No, just to click now.
It'll answer briefly.

1058
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:15,020
That was a little funny. CML.

1059
01:02:15,021 --> 01:02:19,430
It'll stay like that as long as you
want to stay on it. Some nice sound.

1060
01:02:20,250 --> 01:02:24,220
I didn't know always dropped the ball.

1061
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,950
Fun Number five efs. I forgot.

1062
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:29,830
God. Wow. He's like a Jedi
master. Yeah, he's made it. Yeah.

1063
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:33,220
And so he quit what gave
up the job for his friend.

1064
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,560
But it sounds like you
finally got what he wanted.

1065
01:02:35,561 --> 01:02:40,150
I think like he became the master of
the world that he had escaped into,

1066
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:45,540
but he never really dealt with the
world that he had escaped from.

1067
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:48,220
Meaning like that little boy,

1068
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:53,250
that broken little boy that he was still
needed a kind of fixing in a way that

1069
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:58,180
wasn't going to be, you know, no job
is really going to solve that. So,

1070
01:02:58,420 --> 01:03:00,490
so my time,

1071
01:03:01,650 --> 01:03:06,650
he moves to Minneapolis on June 12th
cause six 12 was Minneapolis area code and

1072
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:12,300
he basically becomes
a kid again, you know,

1073
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,260
just everything it did from that point on.

1074
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,390
Other than his phone
had to do with children,

1075
01:03:16,510 --> 01:03:18,850
he'd visit with children
who were terminally ill.

1076
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:21,160
You just visit with children in general.

1077
01:03:21,190 --> 01:03:24,160
I've got a recording at home
affect those, listening to it.

1078
01:03:24,161 --> 01:03:25,690
Last night before he
came to the interview,

1079
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:29,410
I was laughing and giggling because all
these little girls were coming up and

1080
01:03:29,411 --> 01:03:30,760
they were saying, hi

1081
01:03:39,950 --> 01:03:40,370
[inaudible]

1082
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:42,900
when I could hear the parents in
the back saying all of this stuff,

1083
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:47,670
don't sit on his toys
and a, you know, he acts,

1084
01:03:47,671 --> 01:03:50,100
you start talking about little
[inaudible] a little more to me, you know,

1085
01:03:50,101 --> 01:03:54,360
about his being abused and you
know, missing out on his childhood.

1086
01:03:54,390 --> 01:03:59,390
And he was at a seminar at uplifting
seminar and the instructors had something

1087
01:03:59,671 --> 01:04:03,360
on the order of, I'm paraphrasing,
like, tell me how you feel right now.

1088
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:07,020
And he screamed and yelled and threw
up his arms and said, joy bubbles.

1089
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:11,550
And in that moment he decided that
he would actually go by that name,

1090
01:04:12,030 --> 01:04:16,140
Joey bubbles. You may changed his name
legally changed his name to joy bubble,

1091
01:04:16,260 --> 01:04:17,093
all one word.

1092
01:04:17,160 --> 01:04:22,160
And it was around this time that he
decided and announced that he wasn't going

1093
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:23,280
to be an adult anymore.

1094
01:04:23,310 --> 01:04:27,060
His old name and his past was gone
and he wanted to be five years old,

1095
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,280
five years old, forever.

1096
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:33,070
[inaudible]

1097
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,390
and then he started doing this.

1098
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,480
Gosh, this may already, well,

1099
01:04:37,481 --> 01:04:42,390
I'm glad to call them stories
and stuff. Your storyteller,

1100
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:45,130
joy bubble here in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

1101
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,180
You know the recordings I
mentioned at the beginning,

1102
01:04:47,900 --> 01:04:51,590
they're all from the show
that Joe recorded every week.

1103
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:56,150
He called it stories and stuff
and instead of broadcasting it,

1104
01:04:56,600 --> 01:05:00,170
he'd record the episodes to an answering
service and then you'd call a number

1105
01:05:00,560 --> 01:05:02,450
and listen to it on the phone.

1106
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,610
Hello, kids and Thai adults. I think
the title is part tiled and part of,

1107
01:05:07,870 --> 01:05:10,940
don't worry. Hello. Hi. Hello.

1108
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,430
If the story isn't the stuff you've read,

1109
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:16,730
the stories and stuff is by both here in,

1110
01:05:17,650 --> 01:05:20,930
that's all one word. No, don't
you dare. But at Joey a bubble,

1111
01:05:20,970 --> 01:05:24,090
and this may be too
armchair psychoanalytical,

1112
01:05:24,540 --> 01:05:29,540
but it really feels as though it's the
kind of show that he needed to hear when

1113
01:05:29,731 --> 01:05:30,570
he was a kid.

1114
01:05:31,770 --> 01:05:36,770
Like the new five-year-old was trying
to go back and say something to the

1115
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:41,580
five-year-old from the early
fifties. Something akin to,

1116
01:05:42,870 --> 01:05:45,570
it's okay in the end
it's going to be okay.

1117
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:50,520
Yeah, there is help. If you
had like an imaginary friend,

1118
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:55,440
a bunch of them come that are just
looking for somebody to love and play with

1119
01:05:55,441 --> 01:05:59,820
and talk to. And so all you
have to do is any quiet day,

1120
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:02,040
just get quiet and ask for one.

1121
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:06,420
The kind of like the calm and, uh,

1122
01:06:06,650 --> 01:06:10,650
they'll be with you for as long as you
want up and bond the Finito for lifetime

1123
01:06:10,651 --> 01:06:11,484
and beyond.

1124
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:20,680
[inaudible]

1125
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:24,970
thanks to producer Shawn Cole and
to Stephen Gibbs and Phil Lapsley,

1126
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:30,120
who is now finished a
book on freaking and run.

1127
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:32,650
I remember Krulwich thanks for listening.
