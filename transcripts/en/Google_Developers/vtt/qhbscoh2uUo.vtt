00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.500
and scripts that help you
utilize Firebase tools

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.050
and services for adding
cloud-based features

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.630

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.400
by offering a free tier in
three supported regions.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.680

more than a week to upload.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.580

available in the US.
