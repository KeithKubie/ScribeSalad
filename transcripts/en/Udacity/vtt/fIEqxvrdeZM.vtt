00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.402
So far in this lesson, we've talked about different types of memory as well as

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:08.073
different ways of forgetting and memory loss. But, in this next section, we're

00:00:08.073 --> 00:00:11.013
going to switch gears and we're going to talk about the role the brain plays in

00:00:11.013 --> 00:00:15.620
remembering and forgetting. So, the biological basis of memory. We know that

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.755
our long-term memory start with our sensations. And those are processed and

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:23.235
output with our cortical sensory association areas, such as our visual

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:27.237
association or auditory association areas, and that different brain regions are

00:00:27.237 --> 00:00:31.490
involved in different types of memory systems.
