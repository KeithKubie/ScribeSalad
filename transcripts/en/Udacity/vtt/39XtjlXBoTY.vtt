00:00:00.025 --> 00:00:05.464
At age two, doctors told Genie's parents that she had mild retardation. Now her

00:00:05.464 --> 00:00:08.453
father, who was not mentally stable, thought that this meant that she was

00:00:08.453 --> 00:00:13.270
severely retarded and that she needed protection. Now what happens next is

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.038
quite tragic. Throughout her life during the day, her father tied her to a

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:22.638
chair, and in the evenings he caged her in a crib. Moreover, whenever Genie

00:00:22.638 --> 00:00:27.560
tried to speak, her father beat her and barked at her like a dog. Now this

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.860
happened to her throughout her life until she was about thirteen years old when

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.232
her mother ran away and took Genie with her. Now when the social worker first

00:00:35.232 --> 00:00:39.788
met Genie, she though she was only six or seven years old. And this is because

00:00:39.788 --> 00:00:44.630
Genie was only four foot six inches tall and fifty nine pounds. Not what you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.902
would expect from a typically developing thirteen and a half year old. In

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:53.415
addition Genie had very limited language abilities. She could only say things

00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:58.365
such as no more or stop it. Intestingly, after four years of lanuages training,

00:00:58.365 --> 00:01:03.620
Genie still had limited language abilities. She could meet simple demands in

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.390
terms of speaking simple sentences but she could not speak grammatically.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.782
Interestingly though, her language comprehension was much better than her

00:01:11.782 --> 00:01:15.772
language production. Meaning that she was able to understand much of what

00:01:15.772 --> 00:01:17.060
people said to her. [BLANK_AUDIO]
