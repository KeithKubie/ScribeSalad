00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.300 align:start position:0%
ended like this I still would probably
say<00:01:52.170><c> season</c><00:01:52.530><c> one's</c><00:01:52.710><c> been</c><00:01:52.920><c> the</c><00:01:53.040><c> strongest</c>

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 align:start position:0%

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.249 align:start position:0%
ok here's the thing in fat season 1 it
ended<00:02:00.030><c> this</c><00:02:00.149><c> way</c><00:02:00.210><c> we'd</c><00:02:00.479><c> be</c><00:02:00.570><c> like</c><00:02:00.659><c> perfect</c><00:02:01.170><c> this</c>

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 align:start position:0%
ended this way we'd be like perfect this
 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.770 align:start position:0%
ended this way we'd be like perfect this
is<00:02:01.320><c> a</c><00:02:01.500><c> perfect</c><00:02:01.619><c> way</c><00:02:02.340><c> to</c><00:02:02.369><c> end</c><00:02:02.610><c> it</c><00:02:02.790><c> with</c><00:02:03.210><c> this</c><00:02:03.479><c> one</c>

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
is a perfect way to end it with this one
 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.550 align:start position:0%
is a perfect way to end it with this one
uh<00:02:04.159><c> we</c><00:02:05.159><c> don't</c><00:02:05.430><c> entirely</c><00:02:05.820><c> know</c><00:02:06.320><c> what</c><00:02:07.320><c> she's</c>

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 align:start position:0%
uh we don't entirely know what she's
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.910 align:start position:0%
uh we don't entirely know what she's
going<00:02:07.829><c> through</c><00:02:07.979><c> or</c><00:02:08.340><c> what</c><00:02:08.369><c> they're</c><00:02:08.789><c> setting</c><00:02:09.450><c> up</c>

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
going through or what they're setting up
 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.600 align:start position:0%
going through or what they're setting up
so<00:02:10.920><c> why</c><00:02:11.640><c> we</c><00:02:11.940><c> have</c><00:02:12.180><c> a</c><00:02:12.209><c> four</c>

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 align:start position:0%
so why we have a four
 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
so why we have a four
no<00:02:12.850><c> no</c><00:02:13.330><c> I</c><00:02:13.360><c> know</c><00:02:13.540><c> but</c><00:02:14.140><c> that's</c><00:02:14.350><c> why</c><00:02:14.650><c> it's</c><00:02:14.920><c> hard</c><00:02:15.220><c> to</c>

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 align:start position:0%
no no I know but that's why it's hard to
 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
no no I know but that's why it's hard to
get<00:02:15.580><c> like</c><00:02:15.730><c> a</c><00:02:15.970><c> grasp</c><00:02:16.390><c> on</c><00:02:16.690><c> it</c><00:02:16.930><c> because</c><00:02:17.110><c> it's</c><00:02:17.290><c> like</c>

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 align:start position:0%
get like a grasp on it because it's like
 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.020 align:start position:0%
get like a grasp on it because it's like
wait<00:02:17.770><c> what</c><00:02:18.010><c> are</c><00:02:18.040><c> they</c><00:02:18.220><c> doing</c><00:02:18.460><c> cuz</c><00:02:18.610><c> they</c><00:02:18.880><c> what</c>

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 align:start position:0%
wait what are they doing cuz they what
 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.010 align:start position:0%
wait what are they doing cuz they what
they're<00:02:19.120><c> selling</c><00:02:19.240><c> it</c><00:02:19.480><c> won't</c><00:02:19.630><c> be</c><00:02:19.780><c> very</c><00:02:19.900><c> good</c>

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 align:start position:0%
they're selling it won't be very good
 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.200 align:start position:0%
they're selling it won't be very good
it's<00:02:20.350><c> unlikely</c><00:02:20.680><c> I'm</c><00:02:20.920><c> sure</c><00:02:21.070><c> will</c><00:02:21.160><c> be</c><00:02:21.190><c> good</c><00:02:21.430><c> but</c>

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely I'm sure will be good but
 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.030 align:start position:0%
it's unlikely I'm sure will be good but
I<00:02:22.570><c> mean</c><00:02:22.840><c> he'll</c><00:02:22.960><c> like</c><00:02:23.290><c> this</c><00:02:23.320><c> season</c><00:02:23.740><c> they're</c>

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.810 align:start position:0%
talking you know the the spirits coming
in<00:02:26.500><c> the</c><00:02:26.650><c> change</c><00:02:26.950><c> will</c><00:02:27.160><c> be</c><00:02:27.280><c> hard</c><00:02:27.520><c> they'll</c><00:02:27.700><c> be</c>

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 align:start position:0%
in the change will be hard they'll be
 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the change will be hard they'll be
difficult<00:02:28.240><c> but</c><00:02:28.360><c> we</c><00:02:28.570><c> will</c><00:02:28.750><c> go</c><00:02:28.990><c> through</c><00:02:29.410><c> it</c><00:02:29.500><c> and</c>

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:29.710 align:start position:0%
difficult but we will go through it and
 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
difficult but we will go through it and
in<00:02:30.130><c> the</c><00:02:30.280><c> season</c><00:02:30.670><c> they</c><00:02:30.790><c> almost</c><00:02:31.030><c> never</c><00:02:31.270><c> address</c>

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 align:start position:0%
in the season they almost never address
 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.620 align:start position:0%
in the season they almost never address
