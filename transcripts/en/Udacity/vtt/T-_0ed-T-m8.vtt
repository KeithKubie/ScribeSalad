00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Well, let's set up our ratio—d₁/d₂.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, that'd be 20 over—well, let's call this x for now.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And then that's equal to t₁/t₂ or (2/7)², and (2/7)² is just 2²/7² or 4/49.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Solving this for x, I get 980/4, which is 245 m.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
We were able to solve this problem using only ratios and our knowledge of the relationship

00:00:23.000 --> 99:59:59.000
between distance and time for a free falling object.
