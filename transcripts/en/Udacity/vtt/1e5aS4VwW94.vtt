Even as basic a thing as flipping a device

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.170
from portrait to landscape orientation might change the best interface

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.200
pretty dramatically. Like this audio recorder I wrote, where

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.580
the best way to lay out the interface changes in

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.440
landscape mode. This isn't just reflow and percentage sizes.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.890
I needed to change some more dramatic styling to make

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.660
this interface work well. In today's landscape, you should really

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.910
think of your designs in terms of three main scenarios.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.700
Phone, tablet, and desktop. This may share some

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.420
design characteristics of course, and they'll certainly share data,

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.170
but you should consider the optimal experience for each

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.230
of these scenarios separately as you build your design.
