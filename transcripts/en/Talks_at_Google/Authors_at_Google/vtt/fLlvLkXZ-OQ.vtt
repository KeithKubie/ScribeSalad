[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.656 --> 00:00:07.280
DONNA KENNEDY: Thank
you so much, guys,

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.560
for taking the time to be here.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.120
I'm delighted to be here.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.710
But more importantly,
hopefully I

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:15.870
will impact at least one person
here, ideally all of you.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.986
But I would like to
impact one person at least

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.610
so that when you
leave here, you go out

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.430
with a better mindset and a
better attitude towards life

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.875
and also towards your career.

00:00:23.875 --> 00:00:24.750
Does that sound good?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.542
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:00:25.542 --> 00:00:27.074
DONNA KENNEDY: Wonderful.

00:00:27.074 --> 00:00:29.240
So I'm just going to tell
you a little bit about me.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.220
And then I'm going to
tell you where I was

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.050
and how I bridged
the gap in between.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.410
Because all of us want to
get somewhere in our lives,

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.150
whether that be in
our personal lives

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.610
or whether it be in
business or a career.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.130
But sometimes we just
don't know how to do that.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:45.530
So I'm all about the how
because at one point in my life,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.790
I didn't have the how.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.160
I just had a wish.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.910
So I'm just going to
show you a little bit

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.470
about my life at the moment.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:52.930
And this is my little boy.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.920
And at Christmas,
this is how eager

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.510
he was to get his presents.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.000
And I just love doing
anything to do with adrenalin.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.580
But on the flip side,
I love doing art.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.860
I love media stuff,
anything really

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.360
that gives me a
little bit of a buzz

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.430
or a feeling of
purpose for life.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.660
That's me.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.110
At one point in my
life, this was me.

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.635
So I was literally half
the weight I am now.

00:01:14.635 --> 00:01:16.010
So if you imagine
if you split me

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.940
down the middle, what you get,
I know that's hard to believe.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.960
I know it's horrible.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.500
But this basically was this,
A physical representation

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.311
of [INAUDIBLE] need and a
response to my environment.

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.060
That's all it was.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.018
Can everybody see here?

00:01:32.018 --> 00:01:32.800
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.633
DONNA KENNEDY: Yeah?

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:34.774
OK.

00:01:34.774 --> 00:01:35.690
So that's what it was.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.690
And sometimes, I know
this is physical graphic

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.210
representation.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.180
And not all of us
go on that route.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.070
But our responses, our
behaviors can be as destructive.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.780
It could be anything
from procrastination

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.470
to alcohol abuse,
drug abuse, being shy,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.060
not putting yourself forward.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.050
All those things are just
results of unmet needs

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.820
and our reaction to
our environments.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.900
Because would you agree--

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.950
have you ever met
a negative baby?

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.539
No?

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:07.580
You know when people say,
oh, I'm just a worrier.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.020
Have you ever met a worrier
baby or an anxious baby

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.040
or a baby who is just one
of those pessimistic people?

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.690
Never.

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.960
So we're born happy
and successful.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.830
We're just conditioned
over time not to be.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.800
And I'm going to show
you proof of that

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.500
and how you can actually
rise above that conditioning

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.060
and become the best
versions of yourself

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.050
because that's what I want
here for you today is become

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.670
a better version of yourself.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.760
It's not up to me to decide what
it is you want in your life,

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.360
but I'm going to help
you to get there.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.540
This is what I want
you to understand--

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.800
life happens.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.540
Every single person
here has had an event

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.370
in their life that
they haven't liked,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.110
some small event,
some big event.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.660
But you can't really
compare a pain.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.740
You can't really
compare events as such.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.200
But everybody has had
some thing in life

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.080
that has halted them
to stop them becoming

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.820
the person that they
really are truly

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.120
capable of becoming and
reaching their full potential.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.370
And I'm going to tell you
this actually happened to me

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.032
more than once.

00:03:09.032 --> 00:03:11.240
And it's good to know that
because sometimes when you

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.700
become successful-- and
by successful I mean being

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.949
the best you can be--

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:16.490
sometimes when you
become successful,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.531
you think you've made it.

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:20.390
And all of sudden you're flung
back to the way you were.

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.120
So people often ask me, why
is it that I put in my body

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.200
like that?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.820
It's not out of vanity.

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.150
That is not attractive.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.070
Would you all agree?

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:31.350
I put myself like that because
when I was seven, I was raped.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.120
And I didn't know
what to do with it.

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.709
So I kept it in my mind, and
that was the result of it.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.250
OK, I'm going to
flip from that image

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.340
because it's not
very nice to look at.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.180
But that was the result of it.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.380
My life just went
totally out of control.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.350
So because I
couldn't control it,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.700
I came upon this thing called
getting the numbers down

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.380
on the scale.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.504
And that happened to be it.

00:03:49.504 --> 00:03:51.350
I felt in control of my life.

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.270
Control is a norm of human need.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.220
If it's thrown off
balance, we do everything

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:56.960
that we can to get it met.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.410
And we have lots of other needs.

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.190
And if we can't, we go for
the second best alternative.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.190
And that's why we all go for
second best alternatives when

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.200
our needs aren't met.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.207
So eventually I did get better.

00:04:08.207 --> 00:04:10.040
And the only reason I'm
telling him my story

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:13.326
is not to impress you or to
show you where I am today.

00:04:13.326 --> 00:04:15.200
It's to impress upon
you that no matter where

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.700
you are or what
you are doing, you

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.769
can get what you want
with the right mindset,

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:20.600
the right skills, and
the right attitude.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.145
Skills and strategies can
be learned very easily.

00:04:23.145 --> 00:04:25.520
It's your attitude and your
mindset that actually predict

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.080
how well you use those skills.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.160
So when I got better, and
I genuinely was better,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.270
I was healthy.

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.440
I was in [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.730
I had a boyfriend.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.460
I thought I had it made.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.480
And relatively [INAUDIBLE],,
I was going out.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.604
I was [INAUDIBLE] school,
too, jumping off the pier

00:04:40.604 --> 00:04:41.810
during school.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.420
I really, really was
healthy and productive.

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:45.980
I got into first
year in college.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.230
It took a lot because
of psychology.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.750
It was very competitive,
believe it or not.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.630
And I thought I had it made.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.510
And then in 1998, I
had a car accident,

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.900
and I hit my head during
that car accident.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.540
I hit it here on the
side, my temporal lobe.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.070
And about two weeks
later, I started

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.630
to experience funny symptoms.

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.370
I was losing track of time.

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.820
I just wasn't myself.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.520
And I was also hearing
mumbles in my mind.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.830
So I said to my mom,
I know there's nothing

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.480
psychologically wrong with me.

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:18.870
But there's something not right.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.420
And she said, yeah, I agree.

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.289
So go to the doctor.

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.330
So I went to the doctor
and the doctor said to me

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.914
take antidepressants.

00:05:24.914 --> 00:05:26.330
And I said, but
I'm not depressed.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:29.700
And I genuinely wasn't because
I had overcome all that stuff.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.642
And what they said,
well, take them anyway.

00:05:31.642 --> 00:05:33.350
He automatically jumped
to the conclusion

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.200
that it was because of
my earlier years, where

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.210
I guess I was feeling low.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.560
So I took the antidepressants.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.380
Long story short, I ended
up in the psychiatric unit

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.770
two weeks later on
24-hour supervision, which

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.797
means if I walk over here,
I have a human shadow.

00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:51.630
If I go to the bathroom,
if I have a shower,

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.650
I have somebody
literally following me.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.900
They told my parents
that I had schizophrenia.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.920
I had to go on the
medication, the highest dose

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.020
as quickly as possible
and to be committed

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.860
on 24-hour supervision.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.190
Both I and my parents knew
I didn't have schizophrenia.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:08.970
But at the time, my
parents had used up

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.200
the insurance from my earlier
years, so they couldn't use it.

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.626
You can't use the same insurance
on the same illness as such.

00:06:15.626 --> 00:06:17.000
So they didn't
have the insurance

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.660
to cover my hospital stay
to get a second opinion.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:23.060
So I was there.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.210
In three months, I was on
14 different medications.

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.780
You know when you see that
person in say Phoenix Park

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.600
or on Grafton Street or Henry
Street and they're like this.

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.475
And they're dribbling,
and they've got crumbs

00:06:34.475 --> 00:06:36.126
on their top and stuff.

00:06:36.126 --> 00:06:38.000
I know it's hard to
believe that that was me.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.780
So never judge a
book by its cover.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:42.560
I had my face was all
puffy, and I dribbled

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.740
with 14 different medications.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.230
And eventually my parents
said, look, it's just not on.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.980
It's not right.

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:51.140
And they asked for
a second opinion.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.490
They pulled a few strings.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:53.770
They're very good
friends with a doctor.

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.520
They pulled a few
strings, and they got me

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.230
into another hospital.

00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:59.720
And the doctor,
thank god, the doctor

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.304
that I was under,
he said, look, I'm

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:03.470
going to talk to different
people who have seen you.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:04.580
And he did.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.250
He asked my parents
different questions.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.110
And he looked at my file.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.010
And my dad said, can
you tell me this?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.100
Before the accident,
Donna was absolutely fine.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.540
And after the
accident, she's not

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:20.120
normal is the way he put it.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:22.550
The accident surely has
something to do with it.

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:24.170
And they said, what accident?

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.000
It wasn't in my file.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.610
The scan that was
taken of my brain

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.410
had showed on my
left temporal lobe.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.020
It showed a hematoma, which
is bruising of the brain.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:34.550
That also wasn't in my file.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:37.410
So on paper, it looked like
something very different.

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:39.830
So I spent another three
months in a psychiatric unit

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.913
because they had to take
me off all the other junk

00:07:41.913 --> 00:07:43.050
that I was put on.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:46.810
So it got to a point in my
life where the first time

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.446
when I had really
difficult times,

00:07:48.446 --> 00:07:49.570
I was given a week to live.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:50.770
So I was at rock bottom.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.320
And I had to learn to
build myself up again.

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.662
Gratitude helped me to get
that, believe it or not.

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:58.120
I started to have to think
about what is it that I do have,

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.094
not what I don't have.

00:08:00.094 --> 00:08:01.510
But the second
time around, when I

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.426
was in the psychiatric
hospital and the doctor

00:08:03.426 --> 00:08:05.871
said, I have epilepsy, I
said, I don't have epilepsy.

00:08:05.871 --> 00:08:07.870
And I was sick of people
telling me what I have.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.974
And I'm quite stubborn.

00:08:08.974 --> 00:08:10.390
And I said, I don't
have epilepsy.

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.490
Just give me proof
that I have it.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.174
So he sent down to
the hospital library,

00:08:14.174 --> 00:08:16.340
and they both brought up
documents about this thick.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:17.214
And I sat in the bed.

00:08:17.214 --> 00:08:19.900
And honestly, I cried, I'd
say, for about an hour.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.360
And it was just tick,
tick, tick, tick, tick.

00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.940
All the symptoms that I
was experiencing I had.

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.890
So they automatically
jumped to a conclusion

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:29.100
that it was psychiatric
when in actual fact,

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:31.930
the head injury caused a
neurological disturbance

00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.909
in my body.

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:33.799
And I have epilepsy.

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:36.280
And I still have epilepsy.

00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.530
So I had to build my
life up from where

00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.640
I was to where I am today.

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.262
And thankfully I've learned
that's a different strategy.

00:08:45.262 --> 00:08:47.470
So I learned and worked with
lots of different people

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.460
that you consider
very successful.

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.580
At 23, I opened up
my first company.

00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.790
And in the first year, I
turned over a million euro.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:57.310
Now you might think why am
I even telling you that?

00:08:57.310 --> 00:09:01.390
It's just to show you that you
can go from absolute disaster

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.240
to being happy and
genuinely confident.

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.680
And that's what I'm going
to show you here today.

00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.364
There's a difference between
being cocky and confidence.

00:09:09.364 --> 00:09:10.780
If you want to be
cocky or you one

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:13.660
have that shallow confidence,
just become a good actor.

00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:15.880
It's very easy to do.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.130
But if you want to have a
genuine sense of confidence,

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.840
where you don't have to
shout about it so much,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.080
you can just be confident
to feel good in yourself,

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:24.100
where you wake up in the
morning with a genuine smile

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.670
on your face.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:26.074
That's what I want you to have.

00:09:26.074 --> 00:09:27.240
Would you like to have that?

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.232
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:09:28.232 --> 00:09:29.710
DONNA KENNEDY: OK.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.392
So this is about
you've got to decide.

00:09:31.392 --> 00:09:32.725
You've got to look at your mind.

00:09:32.725 --> 00:09:34.390
And I'm going to show
you how it works.

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:36.098
And then you've got
to decide whether you

00:09:36.098 --> 00:09:40.210
need to change your mind,
which is what I had to do.

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.430
And this is a question
you need to ask yourself.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:45.670
Are you becoming a
victim or a victor?

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.367
Everything happens
to everybody in life.

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:50.200
Different things, but
at the end of the day,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.160
stuff happens to us.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.890
It doesn't have to be majorly
traumatic or anything.

00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.837
Stuff happens.

00:09:54.837 --> 00:09:56.920
But if you wanted to get
to where you want to get,

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.669
you need to decide are
you going to become

00:09:58.669 --> 00:10:01.690
a victim of your
circumstance or a victor.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:04.120
You may not know how to get
what it is that you want,

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:06.910
but the how was just a
strategy that can be learned.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:09.670
You've got to make the decision
first to become a victor.

00:10:09.670 --> 00:10:11.440
So which are we going
to be in the room?

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:12.550
Victors or victims?

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:13.945
AUDIENCE: Victors.

00:10:13.945 --> 00:10:17.132
DONNA KENNEDY: Hands up anyone
who would like to be a victim.

00:10:17.132 --> 00:10:20.000
Look around the room.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.617
Admittedly are some
of you-- you don't

00:10:21.617 --> 00:10:23.200
have to put up your
hands-- admittedly

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.620
are some of you looking or are
feeling like a bit of a victim,

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.330
blaming the worst
for your problems?

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:30.910
If only they would do
this, then I could do this.

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:33.100
If only I came from
a better background,

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.300
I could achieve more.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.850
If only I had better brains
or more intelligence,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.440
I would be better or whatever.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.210
We're constantly
doing comparisons

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:43.390
because we are a society of
comparisons in my opinion.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:45.130
So it's so important
that you literally

00:10:45.130 --> 00:10:48.100
take ownership of your own
life and your own choices

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:49.820
no matter what
background you have,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:51.700
no matter where you
came from, who you know,

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.710
or what your current
circumstances is.

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.530
If you want to improve and get
to where you want to get to,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:58.030
that's what you need to decide.

00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:59.405
And you've all
decided here today

00:10:59.405 --> 00:11:00.970
that you're going to be victors.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:03.080
So here's what you've got to do.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.024
You've got to decide
and own your own life.

00:11:05.024 --> 00:11:06.190
And I put business up there.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:07.780
Simply, it can
refer to your career

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.000
or if you have a
business or whatever.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.710
You need to choose
and you focus.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:14.620
So when I was sitting on
my bed, and I was crying.

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:16.820
And I thought, OK, I've
got to do something here.

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:18.100
I didn't want to get
back to baseline.

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.016
I want to go more than
that because I thought,

00:11:20.016 --> 00:11:22.190
I'm not going back
to where I was.

00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:25.570
But I knew how to get there
from the first set of events,

00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:27.140
let's say.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.410
But I guess it was
harder the second time

00:11:29.410 --> 00:11:32.317
because when you're not back
once and twice and you think,

00:11:32.317 --> 00:11:34.900
well, maybe it'll happen again
or something will happen again,

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.730
it's a natural question.

00:11:36.730 --> 00:11:38.430
But I had to decide.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.260
I had to get
stubborn with myself.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.520
And I had to say, quit the crap.

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.650
And really just
own your own life

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:46.710
and become responsible
for your own life.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:48.170
Become greater
than your problems.

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.960
This is what I want
you to understand.

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.880
You are not your problem.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:54.540
If you make your
story your identity,

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.660
you will never do anything
worthwhile in your life

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:59.530
ever, not to the full extent
that you can really achieve

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:02.580
what it is that you want to.

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.680
So decide what you do want.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.300
Most people look at
what they don't want.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.090
Well, I don't want
to be sad anymore.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:10.772
Or I don't want
to be shy anymore.

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.230
I don't want to be
anxious anymore.

00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:14.160
I don't want to be this,
that, or the other.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.080
If you want to get what
it is that you want,

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.000
you've got to
decide with clarity

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.490
what it is that you want.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:20.940
You're all Googlers.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.430
If you decide you want to
search something in Google,

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:27.040
do you put in something
that you don't want?

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.454
This kind of dumb, isn't it?

00:12:28.454 --> 00:12:30.370
So you've got to put in
exactly what you want.

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:32.245
So you've got to tell
yourself what you want.

00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:33.550
Put yourself in a strong state.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.050
Look at the
resources around you.

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:36.640
You have so many resources.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:39.460
What can you use no matter
how small to get you

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.060
to where you want to get to?

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.050
And create a why.

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:45.060
I put that back there as well.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.740
If you've got a why
to do something,

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.210
you will do anything.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.460
How many people
here admittedly get

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.032
in better shape when they have a
holiday or a wedding coming up?

00:12:54.032 --> 00:12:56.610
They go, well, I'm not going
to sit on the beach looking

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.580
like everybody else is there out
there with their beach bodies.

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.320
And it gives you a
motivation to do it.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.500
Admittedly, are we
a bit like that?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.030
If we want to give
up cigarettes,

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.352
we have to put up
a why behind it.

00:13:08.352 --> 00:13:09.810
So when you get a
why, when you get

00:13:09.810 --> 00:13:12.510
a bit of an engine behind what
it is that you want to do,

00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:14.230
you'll be able to
do it a lot easier.

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:15.688
So look at what it
is that you want

00:13:15.688 --> 00:13:17.370
to do if you can identify it.

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.460
If not, just play around with
what you might like to do.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.020
And put a why behind it.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.820
So I had to get a why
behind getting better.

00:13:24.820 --> 00:13:28.376
My why was I was sick of
seeing my parents cry honestly.

00:13:28.376 --> 00:13:30.250
And then I thought, I'm
going to be stubborn,

00:13:30.250 --> 00:13:32.374
and I'm going to get what
it is that I want to get.

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:33.630
But I've got to get my why.

00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:35.580
And that was my initial why.

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:38.550
So get an initial why,
and then build it up.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.280
This is what you've
got to decide, too.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.542
Are you going to be
interested or committed?

00:13:42.542 --> 00:13:45.000
How many people here turned on
their computer this morning?

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:49.880
Were you interested in
doing it, or were you

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.386
committed to doing it?

00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:52.760
Try and put your
hand up, please.

00:13:56.981 --> 00:13:58.956
AUDIENCE: For which question?

00:13:58.956 --> 00:14:01.081
DONNA KENNEDY: Try and put
your right hand up then.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.689
AUDIENCE: For what?

00:14:04.689 --> 00:14:07.204
DONNA KENNEDY: OK, just try
and put your right hand up.

00:14:07.204 --> 00:14:09.620
I'm not asking you whether
you're interested or committed,

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:10.911
try and put your right hand up.

00:14:10.911 --> 00:14:12.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:13.950 --> 00:14:15.350
OK, I said try.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:18.110
I didn't say put it up.

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.120
OK, most people will put it up.

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:22.670
Try and doing are two
totally different things.

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:25.070
If you want to get a result,
you've got to commit to it.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.440
You don't have to be interested.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.815
I can get into my
car and go, oh,

00:14:27.815 --> 00:14:29.740
I'm so interested in driving.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:30.950
Yeah, maybe I'll do it.

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.700
Maybe I won't.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.199
Or I'll say, put
the key in and just

00:14:33.199 --> 00:14:34.820
put my foot on the accelerator.

00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:36.230
Then you then you get somewhere.

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:38.280
So you have to become
not interested.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.300
You need to become committed
to what you're doing.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.372
Remember these three Ps.

00:14:42.372 --> 00:14:44.330
I don't know how well
they're highlighted here.

00:14:44.330 --> 00:14:46.640
Plan, prepare, and proceed.

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.420
Google Maps-- if you want to get
somewhere, you need to decide.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.970
First of all, you
need to type it in.

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.761
You need to decide.

00:14:53.761 --> 00:14:56.330
It decides for you which is
the best route to get there.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:58.310
That's smart, isn't it?

00:14:58.310 --> 00:15:00.120
If you don't decide
where you want to go,

00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.460
you'll end up either nowhere or
somewhere you don't want to be.

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.290
So identify the best
route to get there.

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:09.350
Look at the skills and
the support that you need.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:11.540
Now imagine driving a car.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.930
If I'm driving a car, I've got
certain boundaries in the car.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.540
I need to make sure that I've
got things with me in case

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:18.680
I break down.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.350
Or I've got some resources, or
I've got some maybe telephone

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:23.470
numbers that I can ring
in case I break down

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.030
or in case I hit an obstacle.

00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:26.570
That's smart, isn't it?

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.790
Most people don't put
those in their lives.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.880
Most people do not prepare
for if something happens,

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.070
what will I do?

00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:36.680
So for example, let's say I
meet an event in my life, which

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.930
is very likely, where
my life was totally out

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:40.460
of control for
whatever reason or I

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.330
perceive it to be that way.

00:15:42.330 --> 00:15:45.900
Do you think I could go
back to the way I was?

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:47.970
Absolutely, I could.

00:15:47.970 --> 00:15:49.950
Do you think I will?

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.040
No way.

00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:53.190
And the reason I won't is
because first of all I've

00:15:53.190 --> 00:15:53.773
chosen not to.

00:15:53.773 --> 00:15:55.050
I've committed not to.

00:15:55.050 --> 00:15:57.360
But most importantly, I
have strategies in place

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.665
that if I feel like that
way, if I feel vulnerable,

00:15:59.665 --> 00:16:01.290
I know exactly what
to do to prevent me

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:02.530
from going back there.

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:03.905
So this is why
you've got to have

00:16:03.905 --> 00:16:06.060
strategies and skills
in place to get you

00:16:06.060 --> 00:16:08.130
to where you want to go.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.030
Focus forward.

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:12.520
If you're driving a car--
do most of your drive here?

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.580
OK, if you don't drive,
you've been in the car

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.190
with somebody who does drive.

00:16:17.190 --> 00:16:19.710
If they drove looking in
their rear view mirror,

00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:22.370
what would you think of them?

00:16:22.370 --> 00:16:24.640
Let's drive.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.310
What would you think?

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:27.970
They're insane, right?

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:29.620
So you'd want them
to focus forward.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.719
Most people in the
lights focus backwards.

00:16:31.719 --> 00:16:33.760
Their constantly looking
in the rear view mirror.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.130
Well, I want to do this,
but this happened before.

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:39.220
Or I wanted to do this, but it
didn't work out the last time

00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:40.960
or whatever.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.970
Focus forward on
what you do want.

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.950
If you meet obstacles
along the way, so what?

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:45.790
That's life.

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.290
You just learn how
to overcome them.

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:48.664
If you need to
overcome them, you

00:16:48.664 --> 00:16:50.210
get that help to overcome them.

00:16:50.210 --> 00:16:51.660
But everyone has
those obstacles.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.310
But as long as you're focusing
forward in the right direction.

00:16:54.310 --> 00:16:55.685
You have a good
chance of getting

00:16:55.685 --> 00:16:56.770
to where you want to go.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.290
I have done here
"choose your team."

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.260
Most people in their lives
do not choose their team.

00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:05.170
Imagine if you're in a car, and
you've got a bunch of people.

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:07.300
And one is shouting
at you from the back.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.130
One is firing papers at you.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.990
One is putting their
hands over your eyes.

00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:13.550
What would you say to them?

00:17:13.550 --> 00:17:16.530
Stop, or get out of the car.

00:17:16.530 --> 00:17:19.069
So imagine that your
life is like a car.

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:22.790
You either have to tell
people to stop or remove them.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:23.810
I don't mean kill them.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:24.989
I mean I just remove them.

00:17:24.989 --> 00:17:26.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:29.160
Not delete them,
just a disclaimer.

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.550
But just maybe to
step aside from them

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:33.030
or limit your time with them.

00:17:33.030 --> 00:17:36.500
If people aren't in
line with or matching

00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.230
what it is that you want to do--

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.260
now here's the thing.

00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:42.592
Everybody has a family.

00:17:42.592 --> 00:17:46.880
So some of us have bigger
families than others.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.430
And I have what you might
call [INAUDIBLE] all sorts.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.320
They're not all pro my goals.

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.450
Some of them think they're mad.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.130
Some of them are
very straightforward.

00:17:58.130 --> 00:18:00.770
Some of them are very straight.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:04.580
Some of them are very
hippy-like or whatever.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:07.670
But I've got to choose who
I need to have in my life.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.322
Family you can't
really get rid of.

00:18:09.322 --> 00:18:11.780
So just limit your time with
the ones that you don't enjoy.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:12.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:16.080
With the ones--
you can blame me.

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.170
But choose who you
want to be around.

00:18:18.170 --> 00:18:20.210
But that's not a snobbery thing.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:22.430
At the end of the day,
there's a phrase, which

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:23.960
I think is a wonderful phrase.

00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:28.720
If you're in a plane and the
pressure drops, what do you do?

00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:31.440
Put on your own air mask first.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.000
If you're not looking
after yourself,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.130
you can't look
after other people.

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:38.740
Everyone has their own
individual's lives to lead.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.270
And they are responsible
for their own lives.

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:43.870
So stop being responsible
for their lives.

00:18:43.870 --> 00:18:45.340
Be responsible for your own.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.450
Own your own life.

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.516
And make sure the who you
surround yourself with

00:18:49.516 --> 00:18:50.890
are people who
actually are going

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:54.100
to help you get to where
you want to get to.

00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:55.040
Find an expert.

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.430
This is something
that I had to do.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.980
I had to find experts
because I didn't want

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.350
to do it the slow route again.

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:04.360
I wanted to get to where
I wanted to get to,

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.160
but I didn't know
how as they said.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:10.480
So I had to find people who
had what I wanted regardless

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:11.930
of circumstance.

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:13.900
So I thought, what
if I could find

00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:19.080
people that had been through
rubbish circumstances

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:23.260
but had become
successful despite them?

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:26.230
And I figured if I
model their results

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.700
or if I model
their strategies, I

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.990
should come up with
similar results.

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:31.870
That'd be correct?

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.850
If I want to be a good chef,
would I find a mediocre chef?

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:38.470
Or would I find
the best if I want

00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:40.120
to become really good at it?

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:41.507
You find the best.

00:19:41.507 --> 00:19:43.090
So if you want to
do something, you've

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:46.660
got to find the best at it
and model their strategies.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.370
So learn from experts.

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:51.430
When I learned to drive, I made
sure I learned from somebody

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:53.074
who knew how to drive.

00:19:53.074 --> 00:19:54.490
It wouldn't be
very smart would it

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.860
to learn to drive from
somebody who hadn't a clue

00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.660
what they were doing?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:19:59.340
No.

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.060
But most people
learn from people

00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.800
who haven't a clue
what they're doing.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.250
Believe it or not
in my industry,

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.704
there are a lot of people
teaching or explaining,

00:20:07.704 --> 00:20:09.370
and they actually
don't have the results

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:10.900
that they're talking about.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.520
You will be shocked.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.710
There are so many
experts teaching stuff,

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:16.690
and they don't have the results.

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:18.970
So for me it's more
important to find somebody--

00:20:18.970 --> 00:20:20.710
I don't care what
education somebody has.

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:22.960
I don't care where they're
from, who they know.

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.330
As long as they've got the
results that I can follow,

00:20:25.330 --> 00:20:26.730
that's what I'm interested in.

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:28.306
And everyone knows one of those.

00:20:28.306 --> 00:20:29.680
You may not know
them personally.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.750
If you don't, find them, and
model exactly what they do.

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.030
You do not need to
have all the answers.

00:20:37.030 --> 00:20:38.679
Nobody does even if they say.

00:20:38.679 --> 00:20:40.720
Everybody says, oh, I know
it all in their minds.

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.930
No, you don't.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:44.170
Is there any know-alls here?

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.420
Everyone's going, yeah, he is.

00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:46.900
Yeah, she is.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:48.400
The fact is nobody
knows everything.

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:49.191
I'm still learning.

00:20:49.191 --> 00:20:52.650
Everybody is still learning.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.400
And practice your actions.

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.900
There is no point
thinking about something.

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:59.100
You've got to do.

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.230
And you've got practice
it and practice it.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.940
Remember when you
first got your computer

00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:04.500
and you learned to
use it, are you better

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.008
now than you were
at the beginning?

00:21:06.008 --> 00:21:06.907
AUDIENCE: Of course.

00:21:06.907 --> 00:21:08.490
DONNA KENNEDY: Some
people don't know.

00:21:08.490 --> 00:21:10.418
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:12.350 --> 00:21:13.530
Think of that image--

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.570
council workers.

00:21:15.570 --> 00:21:17.910
I hope nobody here is a
council worker part time,

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.560
but in the event
that you are, there

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.159
is no point staring into a hole.

00:21:22.159 --> 00:21:23.700
Staring into a mess
and looking at it

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:25.080
and having all your
other people that you

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.280
don't want in your life join you
looking in and saying, oh, god.

00:21:27.280 --> 00:21:28.071
That's such a mess.

00:21:28.071 --> 00:21:29.090
That's such a mess.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:29.820
What will we do?

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:31.990
Let's all join in
and talk about it.

00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:35.370
Let's talk about people
who were also there before.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:37.110
That doesn't get you anywhere.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:40.440
Your brain is your
most valuable asset.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:43.330
People learn strategies
all of the time.

00:21:43.330 --> 00:21:46.500
So do I. But unless
you have your brain

00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.180
behind it, your
engine behind it,

00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:52.530
it is like turning on a
computer with no power.

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.910
You don't get results.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:56.610
You have to have your
mindset right first.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:58.320
Mindset equals money set.

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.140
Mindset equals blank set.

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:03.630
Everything you do is
based on your mindset.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:06.960
Do you perform better if
you're feeling better?

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.000
If you've had a really,
really crappy evening

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.458
and you come into
work and you just

00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:14.970
don't want to talk to anybody,
nobody does that, do they?

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:16.650
Everyone has those days.

00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:18.240
So you've got to put
power behind what

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.073
it is that you want.

00:22:19.073 --> 00:22:23.860
And I'm going to show you this
using an analogy of a computer.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.310
You can all relate
to this, right?

00:22:26.310 --> 00:22:29.980
Now if I pick up my phone.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:32.090
And I have here on my phone--

00:22:32.090 --> 00:22:35.450
I actually code my phone
because my son likes to get it.

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:37.610
If you look at all of
those apps on my phone,

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:39.793
how do they get there?

00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:42.198
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:44.540
DONNA KENNEDY: Some were
put on when I got it, right?

00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:45.827
And some I put on.

00:22:45.827 --> 00:22:47.410
Some apps actually
arrive on my phone.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.090
I have absolutely no idea
where they came from.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:53.630
Ads for products that
I have no interest in.

00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:55.250
They just pop up on my phone.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:56.666
I don't know how they got there.

00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:58.790
But there's something been
downloaded all the time.

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:00.665
You're probably responsible
for some of them.

00:23:00.665 --> 00:23:02.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.640
Actually that is just--

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.650
[LAUGHS]

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:07.710
It was your look in your
face that gave it away.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:09.230
So I want you to imagine this.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.992
Imagine somebody
as a total novice.

00:23:11.992 --> 00:23:13.700
They don't know anything
about computers,

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.240
which you were one time.

00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:17.780
And we go into a computer store.

00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:21.417
And we ask the person in the
store, look, can you help me?

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:22.250
They are the expert.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:23.482
And they say, no problem.

00:23:23.482 --> 00:23:25.190
And they feel wonderful
about themselves.

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.814
They come over.

00:23:25.814 --> 00:23:28.370
And you say, well, will you
pick out the best computer

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:29.180
for me, please?

00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:31.610
So they go and they pick
out the best computer

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.780
that they think is the best one.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.970
So this is wonderful.

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.955
And you say, well, I
don't have to use emails,

00:23:36.955 --> 00:23:38.580
but I hear everyone
else is using them.

00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:40.280
So can you just
put that on, too?

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.240
And Microsoft Word
or oops, Google.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:48.110
Put Google on it, put Chrome
on it, whatever you want on it.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:49.371
I don't know how to use it.

00:23:49.371 --> 00:23:50.120
So will you do it?

00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.410
So they say, no problem at all.

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:54.450
So they put all this stuff on.

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:55.820
And then this happens.

00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.170
We get home.

00:23:57.170 --> 00:23:58.310
We become frustrated.

00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:59.210
It's not working.

00:23:59.210 --> 00:24:00.680
Things start to crash.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:03.800
Emails start to
arrive for everything

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:04.940
you could possibly imagine.

00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:07.530
I have got emails from
people that I don't know.

00:24:07.530 --> 00:24:09.110
I have won the
lottery so many times.

00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:12.710
There are people in Algeria who
want to give me a million euro.

00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:15.395
I don't know who they are,
but they arrive all the time.

00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:17.800
Now if I don't know
anything about computers,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.709
do you think I'd
open those junk mail?

00:24:20.709 --> 00:24:22.250
Of course you would
at the beginning.

00:24:22.250 --> 00:24:24.124
Now you may not now
because they know better.

00:24:24.124 --> 00:24:27.170
But at the beginning you
open everything, don't you?

00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:28.820
And programs start to crash.

00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:31.220
And we think, is there
something wrong with us?

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.960
So imagine when you
first use a computer,

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.360
and just stuff wasn't working.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.250
Or even now, if a program
isn't working for you,

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.330
it's frustrating, isn't it?

00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:41.640
And sometimes you think,
what is wrong with me?

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.610
Why can't I just get this right?

00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:45.830
So using that analogy, and
I like to use analogies

00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:47.317
because it simplifies things.

00:24:47.317 --> 00:24:49.400
I want you to imagine the
computer like your brain

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.810
when you're born.

00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:53.135
When you're born, we
have a basic computer.

00:24:53.135 --> 00:24:54.870
We have a basic brain.

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:57.800
We have the ability to learn a
language, the ability to move,

00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.180
and the ability to feed.

00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.650
That's it.

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.625
How do you think you have
the accent that you have?

00:25:04.625 --> 00:25:05.250
You learned it.

00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:07.400
And you were constantly
exposed to it.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.100
Some of you here
have been exposed

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:13.109
to a second language rather
than your first language

00:25:13.109 --> 00:25:14.150
because you're around it.

00:25:14.150 --> 00:25:16.483
And the more you're around
it, the better you get at it.

00:25:16.483 --> 00:25:18.490
And all information
comes into us

00:25:18.490 --> 00:25:21.330
like apps on the
phone or a computer.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.140
It comes in constantly.

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.640
Our accent, our walks.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.510
I got the raw deal.

00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:32.050
I got a male accent,
seriously, flat as a whatever.

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:33.790
But everybody has
an accent simply

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:36.910
because it came
in to your brain.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:40.335
Every opinion you have, every
cultural opinion you have,

00:25:40.335 --> 00:25:41.710
every religious
opinion you have,

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:43.293
everything that you
have in your brain

00:25:43.293 --> 00:25:45.880
was downloaded either
by your environment

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:47.620
or by somebody else.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.790
You just let it in.

00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:51.370
Same way the stuff
gets into my phone.

00:25:51.370 --> 00:25:52.660
Somebody put it in there.

00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.870
Sometimes I download
stuff that isn't good.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.860
But it goes in there.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.990
And that's the exact
same as our brains.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:01.330
Now this red thing here
represents emotions.

00:26:01.330 --> 00:26:04.560
Sometimes our brain
has emotional tags.

00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.940
And what that means
is you're here.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.920
There's lots of
information going on,

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.930
the lights of the fan,
the camera, everything.

00:26:10.930 --> 00:26:13.510
You couldn't possibly focus
on it all at the same time.

00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:15.700
You would go crazy, right?

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:16.960
So we filter information.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.460
We narrow it down
to the things that

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.800
are important to us, the
things that you can focus on,

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:22.960
that you need to focus on.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:26.890
And sometimes there's emotions
tagged to information.

00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:28.450
It's like, I guess,
an app or a CD.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:30.160
If you imagine--
or a DVD, whatever.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.000
You just put it into your brain.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.270
So if you imagine, you go
through life, for example.

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:35.350
And you get into school.

00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:37.800
Before you go to school, you
think you're really smart.

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:40.060
My four-year-old at the
minute, he is a genius

00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.350
as far as he is concerned.

00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:43.719
He actually did a picture
yesterday, and I have to say,

00:26:43.719 --> 00:26:44.510
he's very creative.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.870
So I did call him a
genius on Facebook.

00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:48.194
He is wonderful.

00:26:48.194 --> 00:26:49.110
And I give praise him.

00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:50.960
I'm totally biased.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.780
Now what happens when
he goes into school?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.397
Do you think he's going to start
getting color inside the lines?

00:26:56.397 --> 00:26:57.730
Make sure you do this correctly.

00:26:57.730 --> 00:26:58.979
If you get an A, you are good.

00:26:58.979 --> 00:27:01.000
If you get an F,
you're real rubbish.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.812
He gets all different
information.

00:27:02.812 --> 00:27:05.020
Hopefully I'll be able to
prevent or at least reframe

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:05.840
some of that.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.048
But he'll get all that stuff.

00:27:07.048 --> 00:27:11.380
So we actually monitor and,
I guess, equate how we are

00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:13.840
and how valuable we
are in our identity

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:16.150
to our performance
in society and what

00:27:16.150 --> 00:27:18.370
society tells us is good.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:21.610
So let's imagine I'm in
school, and my teacher

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.440
tells me that I'm stupid.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:27.160
Or I get an F, or I get
it a G, or whatever.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.840
And automatically
my brain tells me

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:30.460
that means I'm not good enough.

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:33.910
So I download it, and
it's emotionally tagged.

00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:35.800
Now here's the thing.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.670
All of our senses are involved
in this, our feelings,

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:41.310
what we see, everything.

00:27:41.310 --> 00:27:44.830
So it goes in almost
just like a movie.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:46.560
It goes into our
minds, and it plays.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.552
If there's a lot of emotion
tied to it, it would play a lot.

00:27:49.552 --> 00:27:51.010
If there's not
really much emotion,

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.990
you probably don't
even notice it.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:57.470
Our brain's purpose is to
keep us alive and safe.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.330
It likes to keep us comfortable.

00:27:59.330 --> 00:28:01.760
So if it recognizes
something in the environment

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.460
that it doesn't like,
it will try to avoid us,

00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:06.450
or it will try and deal with us.

00:28:06.450 --> 00:28:08.700
That's called fight or flight.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.350
So if we have an emotional
tag to a piece of information

00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:14.360
or to something that
happens in our lives that

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.110
makes us feel uncomfortable,
if we come across that again

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:22.520
or something similar, your
brain has to generalize.

00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:25.260
How did you know to
sit on that chair?

00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:27.510
Because you've sat in a chair
before and you know what

00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:29.462
a chair does.

00:28:29.462 --> 00:28:31.170
How do you know when
you walk into a door

00:28:31.170 --> 00:28:33.210
that it opens this
way or that way?

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:36.060
The first time you walked
into a door or into the door,

00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:38.280
through the door,
the first time you

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:39.910
did that maybe when
you were a baby,

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:42.010
you had to figure out
what does this do.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:43.380
But our brain generalizes.

00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.940
Generalize is
positive and negative.

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:48.450
So for example, when
that happened to me

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:51.570
when I was younger, it
was a one-off event.

00:28:51.570 --> 00:28:54.060
There was lots of emotions
obviously tagged to it.

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:56.910
But my brain, in order to
keep me safe and comfortable,

00:28:56.910 --> 00:28:59.640
said, from now on, if I
experience anything like this

00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:02.170
again, trigger all
those same emotions.

00:29:02.170 --> 00:29:05.070
And then I have a chance to
decide what to do with them.

00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:07.170
So can you imagine if I
went into a situation,

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:09.120
and I got bullied?

00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.150
Which is control taken
away from me as well.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:14.830
How do you think I'd react?

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:17.800
Now if you imagine, if
somebody started to ask me

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.740
where are you going and
what time would you be back,

00:29:20.740 --> 00:29:23.844
do you think that might
have bothered me then?

00:29:23.844 --> 00:29:25.760
Yeah, because I felt
they were controlling me.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.676
They probably weren't.

00:29:26.676 --> 00:29:28.070
But I felt that they were.

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.039
So it generalizes.

00:29:29.039 --> 00:29:29.830
It's like a Hoover.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:32.380
It sucks everything up and then
says, from now on, anything

00:29:32.380 --> 00:29:35.260
I see or hear of smell
or taste or feel,

00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.030
I'm going to trigger
those same emotions.

00:29:37.030 --> 00:29:39.370
And that is why if
somebody, for example,

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.320
is afraid to give
a presentation,

00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:44.500
it's probably because at
some point in your life,

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.920
you would have seen or
experienced judgment

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.260
at a presentation and
you didn't like it.

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.480
Or you saw somebody that
maybe people laughed at

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.716
or something like that.

00:29:53.716 --> 00:29:55.090
If you're afraid
to do something,

00:29:55.090 --> 00:29:56.589
it's because somewhere
in your mind,

00:29:56.589 --> 00:29:59.140
you've got a CD playing or a
movie playing that tells you

00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.162
if I did this, this
is what happens.

00:30:01.162 --> 00:30:01.870
We all got those?

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:02.590
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:03.839
DONNA KENNEDY: Everybody does.

00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.450
That happens in
the limbic system.

00:30:08.450 --> 00:30:11.440
The limbic system is basically
really primitive part

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:12.490
of the brain.

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:14.366
Apes have it.

00:30:14.366 --> 00:30:16.240
I'm not saying we came
from apes, by the way,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.400
I'm just saying that
it's as primitive.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.590
It's as dumb as an ape.

00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:21.850
It's very black and white.

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.460
It doesn't see the difference,
reasoning, or nothing.

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.800
Reasoning is in a different
part of our brain .

00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:29.230
So it's all to do with
emotions, to do with memories,

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:33.201
to do responses, to do with
reward and desire, memories,

00:30:33.201 --> 00:30:33.700
everything.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:36.910
It's all banked in
the limbic system.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:37.895
And what it does--

00:30:37.895 --> 00:30:38.770
this is how it works.

00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:42.210
And this is really important
that you pay attention to this.

00:30:42.210 --> 00:30:45.280
It can't tell the difference
between what's real or imagined

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.600
at a neurological level.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.520
Admittedly, and guys can admit
this, too, if you're in a movie

00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.450
or watching a DVD and
it's a horror movie

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:58.630
and all of a sudden
something starts to happen.

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:02.500
And your heart starts to
beat, and your sweat glands

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.340
start to activate.

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:05.060
And your blood pressure goes up.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.840
And you're like, oh, god,
I don't want to see this.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.640
Even though you know
it's green screen.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:10.840
It's all special effects.

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.100
And they're acting.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.410
So why would your body
physically respond?

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:17.740
Because on a neurological level,
the limbic system cannot tell

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.260
the difference between
what is real or imagined.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:22.360
So it responds anyway.

00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.060
And the more a body physically
responds to something,

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.700
the more adrenaline and
cortisol is released.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:32.560
The more we shy away from things
if the emotion is negative.

00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.750
Also it does not
filter information.

00:31:34.750 --> 00:31:37.810
Now do not, and I'm
telling you, do not,

00:31:37.810 --> 00:31:41.110
think of a pink elephant.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:42.106
I said, don't.

00:31:42.106 --> 00:31:43.480
Now whatever you
do, I don't want

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:45.850
you to think of Grafton
Street, and you're going up.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.090
And wow, there's a red
dress in the shop window.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:51.220
And then all of a sudden
you see a yellow football

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:52.450
on the ground.

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:54.730
Don't think of that.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.062
We've all thought of it, right?

00:31:56.062 --> 00:31:57.520
So our brain doesn't
differentiate.

00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.630
it's like a junk mail.

00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:59.770
Everything just comes in.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.610
It's up to us what we engage in.

00:32:01.610 --> 00:32:02.940
But everything comes in.

00:32:02.940 --> 00:32:05.110
So everything
somebody says to you,

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.060
you register almost
like as a download.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.682
It's up to you
what to do with it.

00:32:08.682 --> 00:32:10.390
But if you've got
these programs going on

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:13.060
in your head that are
emotionally tagged,

00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:16.702
it makes it deal with it
ineffectively as I did.

00:32:16.702 --> 00:32:17.660
Here's the other thing.

00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:19.950
It is responsible, as I said,
for the fight or flight.

00:32:19.950 --> 00:32:23.700
Do I deal with it,
or do I run away?

00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:26.220
Programs or behaviors
and habits, and it

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:29.080
strengthens responses
through repetition.

00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.360
If I have a dumbbell here and I
do that, it strengthens my arm,

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.140
right?

00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:34.110
But I won't really
know what [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:35.276
because it's only done once.

00:32:35.276 --> 00:32:37.699
What if I keep doing it?

00:32:37.699 --> 00:32:38.240
What happens?

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:42.970
You're all judging
my arm right now.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.710
No, I do not go to
the gym too much.

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.651
But it's supposed
to get stronger.

00:32:47.651 --> 00:32:49.150
You all speak the
language you speak

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.470
because you've practiced it.

00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.485
You all can do this because
you've practiced it.

00:32:53.485 --> 00:32:55.360
The more you do it, the
better you get at it.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.580
And this includes our
thinking and our mindset.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.950
The more we talk to ourselves--

00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.690
admittedly, have you ever felt
a bit of a sniffle like a cold

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:05.440
and you didn't really
want to go into work

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.898
or you didn't want
to do something?

00:33:06.898 --> 00:33:08.620
And it's oh, god, I
have an awful cold.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.960
I can feel my
sinuses blocking up.

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.452
Yeah, I think my throat
is going as well.

00:33:13.452 --> 00:33:14.410
And you start coughing.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.140
And you start actually
talking yourself into it.

00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.080
We do it all the time.

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.180
We don't even realize.

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.000
That part of the brain is like
an engine in the background.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.950
We don't realize it's happening.

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:26.360
So this is about becoming
conscious of what you're doing.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.450
Become very aware of
what you're doing.

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.630
And things can change.

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:35.080
Change perspective.

00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:36.610
Normally I don't
wear sunglasses,

00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.500
so I thought I'd put
them there just in case.

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.566
I mean, you stand up
for a minute, please?

00:33:41.566 --> 00:33:44.060
Oh, no.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:46.401
If you were four, do you
think you'd mind standing up?

00:33:46.401 --> 00:33:47.442
AUDIENCE: No, I wouldn't.

00:33:47.442 --> 00:33:49.340
DONNA KENNEDY: No, OK.

00:33:49.340 --> 00:33:49.970
Put those on.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:51.680
Turn around.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.950
She looks lovely, doesn't she?

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:56.486
Now just turn around
there for a second.

00:33:56.486 --> 00:33:57.860
The room is the
way it is, right?

00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:58.205
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:58.205 --> 00:33:59.510
DONNA KENNEDY: Now
how does it look now?

00:33:59.510 --> 00:34:00.490
AUDIENCE: A lot darker.

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.050
DONNA KENNEDY: A lot darker.

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.320
Now can you imagine
if she walked around

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:05.070
with the sunglasses
what she would look at

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.080
and what she would see?

00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.384
Let's take them off now.

00:34:08.384 --> 00:34:11.659
OK, and sit back down.

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:13.489
What we see in the
world is predicted

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.230
by what filter we have.

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:17.840
If I walk around, for example,
with this phone in front

00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:20.300
of my eyes, all my
downloads, that's

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:21.620
how I'm going to see the world.

00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.780
So it's not
necessarily the people

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.460
think of you a certain way.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:29.239
If you programs running in your
mind, you think that they do.

00:34:29.239 --> 00:34:31.310
You perceive that they do.

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:35.480
Cultural differences,
race differences,

00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:37.679
everything from the
way people look,

00:34:37.679 --> 00:34:40.800
the way people dress,
the way people speak,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.530
we all perceive
that they're going

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:45.590
to be a certain way
because of our downloads.

00:34:45.590 --> 00:34:47.989
Because of the information
we grow up with,

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.460
we perceive various
different things.

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.460
So do you think that
I could perceive

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:56.350
that people were controlling my
life after that event happened?

00:34:56.350 --> 00:34:57.530
Absolutely.

00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:59.750
Were they controlling my life?

00:34:59.750 --> 00:35:01.240
No.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.150
When somebody said to me when
I was at my lowest weight,

00:35:04.150 --> 00:35:07.120
and someone said, Donna--
and I was getting back up--

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:09.970
you're starting to look
better, I hated them.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:12.040
I absolutely hated them.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.770
Yet to look a little bit
better would probably

00:35:14.770 --> 00:35:15.610
be healthier, right?

00:35:15.610 --> 00:35:18.640
So it didn't make any sense that
I wouldn't want to look better.

00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:21.794
So I used to think everybody
was telling me if they said,

00:35:21.794 --> 00:35:23.710
I looked better, it meant
they were telling me

00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:27.480
I was fat, which was
just a perception.

00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:28.350
That's all.

00:35:28.350 --> 00:35:30.420
So everything that
you do in your life

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.530
is a perception of reality.

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.160
It's not necessarily reality.

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:36.692
Does that make sense?

00:35:36.692 --> 00:35:39.230
So you've got to change the
perceptions that you have

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:41.300
and open your mind
to new thinking.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.160
Open your mind to
different opinions.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.290
Open your mind to
different ways of looking

00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:49.490
at what you want to achieve
and how you might achieve it.

00:35:49.490 --> 00:35:54.570
Understand the perspective
is not the same as a reality.

00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.570
And this is a question
you need to ask yourself.

00:35:56.570 --> 00:36:00.350
Are you prepared to allow your
perceptions or your programs

00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:03.140
to determine what
you do in your life?

00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:04.790
If somebody called
you stupid, are you

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:08.150
prepared to allow them to
control what you achieve?

00:36:08.150 --> 00:36:10.880
If you grew up in a
really disadvantaged area,

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.600
are you going to allow that to
dictate how wealthy you become?

00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:18.870
If you decided that
you want a promotion

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:21.300
but you don't think you can
because your sister told you

00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.760
that you probably
won't get it, are you

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:27.090
going to allow that to
dictate what you do?

00:36:27.090 --> 00:36:29.490
That's your decision, that
you have to own your life

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:31.350
and allow yourself
to make decisions

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:34.290
based on your new reality
if that makes sense.

00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:35.760
And this is neurological, guys.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:38.370
This is not me just
talking theory.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:40.270
This happens for real.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:43.500
You are literally being
wired every single minute

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.670
of your day.

00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:47.280
As I've been talking, you've
been thinking different ways.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.880
You've been reframing stuff.

00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.130
You've been thinking, well,
how does that apply to me?

00:36:51.130 --> 00:36:52.713
Or how could I use
that in the future?

00:36:52.713 --> 00:36:55.326
How could use it in this
circumstance, right?

00:36:55.326 --> 00:36:56.700
So when you're
doing that, you're

00:36:56.700 --> 00:36:58.340
changing your perception.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.960
And all that takes
is bringing experts

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:03.670
into your life that
have good ones.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.990
Literally choosing the downloads
that you get in your brain,

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.580
choosing who you talk to.

00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:10.500
If you talk to miserable
people all day,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.020
guess what you're going to feel.

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:14.640
Miserable.

00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.690
Here's the fix.

00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:17.250
You go home from work.

00:37:17.250 --> 00:37:18.030
Yay.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.210
"EastEnders," half an
hour, "Coronation Street"

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:23.839
after it I think, "Fair
City" at some point.

00:37:23.839 --> 00:37:25.380
Then you watch maybe
the news, or you

00:37:25.380 --> 00:37:27.280
might hear the news every hour.

00:37:27.280 --> 00:37:29.114
Remember your body is
physically responding.

00:37:29.114 --> 00:37:31.613
So if you're watching somebody
scraping somebody else's eyes

00:37:31.613 --> 00:37:33.540
out on the pavement
over a row over someone

00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.990
who's had an affair or you're
watching the news every hour,

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.240
your body is physically
responding and wiring you

00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:41.490
neurologically.

00:37:41.490 --> 00:37:46.129
My body was wired neurologically
for unproductive responses.

00:37:46.129 --> 00:37:47.670
So if you want
something in your life

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:49.740
or your career, whatever
it is, that's up to you.

00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.217
You have to wire yourself
correctly for it.

00:37:52.217 --> 00:37:54.300
The only things you should
be putting in your mind

00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:57.420
is positive information,
productive information--

00:37:57.420 --> 00:38:00.840
everything you read, who
you talk to, what you watch.

00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.290
And it does have a difference.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.100
I am living proof
that has a difference.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:07.447
I used to talk myself miserable.

00:38:07.447 --> 00:38:09.780
I used to say everything to
myself that I could possibly

00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:11.190
say that was negative.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:14.400
But once I started to seek
out experts or people who

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.770
knew what they were
doing, successful people--

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.270
successful basically
to me is being

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:21.000
the best you can be in
whatever area you choose.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.190
So what if I was to
find those people

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:26.460
and let them download on
me, let them tell me what it

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.800
is that I need to be wired for?

00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:31.080
Do you think that would
be a smarter move?

00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:35.610
OK, so think about who it
is that you can learn from.

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.200
You may not
personally know them.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.190
Read about them.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:39.390
Some of you have my book.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:39.960
Read it.

00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:40.500
Do it.

00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:42.510
There's exercises in it.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.830
Look at people on TV.

00:38:43.830 --> 00:38:44.800
How do they walk?

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:46.560
How do they talk if
they feel confident?

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.130
If I walk along
like this, do you

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.540
think my neurology will
make me feel confident?

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.700
Absolutely not because
here's the thing--

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.460
your body and your mood
are directly related.

00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.250
It's called a
psycho-cybernetic loop.

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:01.350
If I look down
like that, my body

00:39:01.350 --> 00:39:05.130
will tell me that posture
matches feeling bad.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:08.550
If I curl in like that, if I
want to do something really

00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:10.780
well, if I gave a
presentation like that,

00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.641
how do you think I'd give it?

00:39:12.641 --> 00:39:16.590
Or if I sat down like this
and I walked over like this,

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:19.260
how do you think I'd
give that presentation?

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.275
Not strong.

00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:23.400
For example, do you want
to engage with new people?

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.700
Or you want a new relationship.

00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:27.060
Or you want to
learn something new.

00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.250
Make yourself in that posture.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.960
Think if I knew someone who
was really good at this,

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.662
and you may know of them,
how would they stand?

00:39:34.662 --> 00:39:36.120
What tone of voice
would they have?

00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.730
How would they breathe?

00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:39.870
At one point in my
life, I was literally

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:41.670
afraid to cross
the road on my own.

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.460
I had to get my mother
to hold my hand.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.527
Before that, I didn't want
to go outside my door.

00:39:46.527 --> 00:39:47.610
I used to go under my bed.

00:39:47.610 --> 00:39:50.900
As my mother called it, I
used to go into my hole.

00:39:50.900 --> 00:39:53.240
And for me, I have
to do it gently.

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:56.910
So I had to go in for a cup of
coffee, which was terrifying.

00:39:56.910 --> 00:40:00.350
I would genuinely have preferred
to chew on glass than do that.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.320
How am I up here talking to you?

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.580
I had to decide.

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.140
I had to become committed.

00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.640
I had to get the skills
and practice them often

00:40:08.640 --> 00:40:10.640
till I become wired for it.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.820
So then it becomes as
natural to me as breathing.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:16.900
And every single thing
that you want to do,

00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.590
you can do this just by
wiring yourself for it.

00:40:20.590 --> 00:40:22.420
So assess your current life.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:25.960
Assess the downloads you're
putting into your brain.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:29.320
If you're literally working
on your laptop, and you're

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.130
looking at things.

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:32.300
You're typing in stuff
that's negative all the time.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:34.075
Or you're typing in
crappy codes if you

00:40:34.075 --> 00:40:35.350
are trying to learn something.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:37.690
How do you think
you're going to feel?

00:40:37.690 --> 00:40:39.220
So why do it for real?

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:41.806
Because we have become
conditioned to do it naturally.

00:40:41.806 --> 00:40:43.180
In our island
especially, and I'm

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:45.970
sure it is across the
world, it's almost bad

00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:47.620
to become successful.

00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.700
The minute someone
becomes bankrupt, yes.

00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:53.080
They've lost all their property.

00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.550
I'm so delighted because
they were greedy anyway.

00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:56.830
And all of this stuff.

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:59.890
We celebrate people when
they fail because it

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:01.270
makes us feel more comfortable.

00:41:01.270 --> 00:41:02.960
Now in saying that,
I don't anymore.

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.460
I love it when
people are successful

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.294
and people are happy
and achieve their goals

00:41:06.294 --> 00:41:07.585
because they think differently.

00:41:07.585 --> 00:41:09.100
And they look at
people differently.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.390
Imagine people are ringing you.

00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:15.774
And I say, do I want
to answer them or not?

00:41:15.774 --> 00:41:17.440
Imagine if they're
going to fill my mind

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.939
with been talking about somebody
else and being really mean.

00:41:19.939 --> 00:41:20.722
Will I answer it?

00:41:20.722 --> 00:41:21.606
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:21.606 --> 00:41:23.350
DONNA KENNEDY: No.

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:25.381
So why answer people
or answer messages

00:41:25.381 --> 00:41:27.130
or answer information
from the environment

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:29.950
if it doesn't make
you feel good?

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.390
Only answer and engage
and open up information

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.370
that makes you feel wonderful.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:40.400
Find it, read it, put
it into your brain,

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.160
download it, and practice it.

00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.244
You can do this as a little tip.

00:41:47.244 --> 00:41:48.410
This is something that I do.

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:51.530
And it's very simple,
but it's quite effective.

00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:56.710
I want you to imagine a Delete
button in your head, OK?

00:41:56.710 --> 00:41:58.870
There it is.

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:01.300
If somebody says something
negative to, and that

00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:07.540
includes yourself, if you watch
the news more than every half

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:14.140
an hour or every hour, I
want you to press Delete.

00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:16.630
Literally imagine pressing it.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:19.030
Can you all imagine that
putting in your brain?

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.580
If you can't imagine it
visually, look at this

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:23.080
and feel it going
into your brain.

00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:24.010
Or hear that sound.

00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.180
OK, so delete it.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:35.390
Importantly, you need to replace
it with something positive.

00:42:35.390 --> 00:42:39.400
So if for example I say to
myself, I can't afford it

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.720
and it makes me feel bad, how
about reframing it and saying,

00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:44.000
how can I afford it?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.490
What do I need to
do to afford it?

00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:49.010
It's a different question, and
you'll get a better answer.

00:42:49.010 --> 00:42:52.770
The questions you answer
determine the answers.

00:42:52.770 --> 00:42:54.860
Sorry, the questions you
ask determine the answers

00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.562
that you'll get.

00:42:55.562 --> 00:42:57.020
If you ask crappy
questions, you're

00:42:57.020 --> 00:42:58.405
going to get bad answers.

00:42:58.405 --> 00:43:00.980
If you ask better questions
or reframed questions,

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.690
guess what you're going to get?

00:43:02.690 --> 00:43:05.810
Better answers and
better solutions.

00:43:05.810 --> 00:43:06.550
Imagine this.

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.082
Hear it.

00:43:12.082 --> 00:43:14.040
I want you to imagine it
going into your brain.

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:16.260
I also want you to
do something else.

00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:18.690
Who's right-handed here?

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:21.720
OK, this evening or today
if you have them here--

00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:23.940
I'm sure you do--
get an elastic band

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.040
and put it on your left
hand on your left wrist.

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.190
Who's left-handed?

00:43:29.190 --> 00:43:32.065
OK, get an elastic band, and
put it on your right hand.

00:43:32.065 --> 00:43:32.940
Now here's the thing.

00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:36.020
I want you to wear
this for 24 hours.

00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:38.520
If anybody asks, say that
lunatic, Donna Kennedy,

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.030
made me wear it.

00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:40.950
There's a reason.

00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:44.520
And people may ask, why
you're wearing elastic bands?

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:47.310
Any time you think something
negative about yourself

00:43:47.310 --> 00:43:50.180
or somebody says, I
want you to get this

00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:51.810
depending on your
hand, and I want

00:43:51.810 --> 00:43:54.300
you to do this and let it
spring back so it hurts.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:56.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:57.960
It will shock you.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.600
Wear it in the shower,
everywhere for the next 24

00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.680
hours.

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.110
It will shock you how many,
many negative thoughts

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.490
you engage in every day.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:06.960
It is like sitting
at your computer

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.140
and opening up negative
emails all of the time

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:14.220
and wondering why you don't
feel good or perform well.

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.950
Look at what it is
that you're opening up.

00:44:16.950 --> 00:44:18.990
What is it that you want
to hear in your life?

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.530
Every single time, no matter
when it is or where it is,

00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:24.210
bang it good and hard.

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:26.822
Whack it off your arm and go,
I shouldn't have done that.

00:44:26.822 --> 00:44:28.280
Now why am I asking
you to do that?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.477
Not to give you pain,
although it will hurt.

00:44:31.477 --> 00:44:33.810
I'm only asking you to do
that because here's the thing.

00:44:33.810 --> 00:44:35.010
It's physical.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:37.500
Your body will go, oh,
I didn't expect that.

00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:39.480
So it changes the pattern.

00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:42.674
When I'm asking you to put
a positive program in there

00:44:42.674 --> 00:44:44.340
or delete your negative
programs and put

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.420
a positive one in its place,
your brain doesn't expect it.

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:51.060
Our brain is conditioned
so it just does that.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.670
How many people honestly, if
we left the room and came back,

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.960
you'd sit in the same seat?

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.920
Now imagine if somebody
else sat in your seat.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.026
Would you go, oh, she
didn't sit in my seat.

00:45:01.026 --> 00:45:02.730
Move.

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:05.010
Because we get into
habits so easy.

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:08.910
How many people have their side
of the couch that they sit on

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.562
or their mug?

00:45:11.562 --> 00:45:13.770
When you go home, you put
your keys in the same place

00:45:13.770 --> 00:45:15.916
all the time without
even thinking.

00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:18.540
Or you drive home and you don't
realize how you even got there.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.490
You could be thinking
of something else.

00:45:20.490 --> 00:45:22.820
Because we do
things on automatic.

00:45:22.820 --> 00:45:24.750
And I want you to learn
stuff on automatic

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.610
that will help you to be
the best that you can be.

00:45:27.610 --> 00:45:28.770
That's going to help you.

00:45:28.770 --> 00:45:30.540
Doing this will
actually help you

00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:32.887
because it will throw
your brain off track.

00:45:32.887 --> 00:45:35.220
It doesn't matter what you
do, whether you slap yourself

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.927
in the face, whether you
drink a drink you don't like,

00:45:37.927 --> 00:45:40.260
whether you smell something
you don't like as long as it

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.190
interrupts your brain.

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.930
But I want you to just do that
because it's really simple.

00:45:43.930 --> 00:45:45.680
And if you ever do it
again in the future,

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.630
put that elastic band back
on and watch what happens.

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.930
You will genuinely be shocked
at how much negative rubbish

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:54.230
you're putting into your lives.

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:58.810
So hands up who is going
to become a victor.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:01.670
Now to physically get it, I
want you to stand up and become

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:03.960
a victor.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:04.550
Oh, my god.

00:46:04.550 --> 00:46:05.290
I'm standing up.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:07.970
People are looking at me.

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:11.465
Now this time look slightly
above my level just slightly

00:46:11.465 --> 00:46:16.690
above eye level as though you're
walking like, I have this got.

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.790
Breathe deeply.

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:23.740
Now think of someone who's super
confident and relaxed in a way,

00:46:23.740 --> 00:46:25.510
but they've got
genuine confidence.

00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:29.400
You might see them on
TV or might know them.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:31.710
Now think like them.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:32.730
How would they walk?

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.890
How would they breathe?

00:46:34.890 --> 00:46:37.930
Will you walk differently.

00:46:37.930 --> 00:46:41.320
Now I want you to all, for a
second, look down at the floor.

00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:45.144
Put your shoulders in like this.

00:46:45.144 --> 00:46:46.310
How do you feel?

00:46:46.310 --> 00:46:47.450
AUDIENCE: Bad.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:48.920
DONNA KENNEDY: OK,
now the back up.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:50.610
Look slightly above eye level.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.890
And she breathes already.

00:46:53.890 --> 00:46:54.530
So sit down.

00:46:59.070 --> 00:47:01.450
If you engage your
brain correctly,

00:47:01.450 --> 00:47:03.120
you will embrace
the day differently.

00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.774
You'll start to
behave differently.

00:47:04.774 --> 00:47:05.940
But you need to do it often.

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.320
This is not a one-time thing.

00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:11.940
You need to continually do it
until it becomes automatic.

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:15.000
And I'm going to finish up on
this because I know time-wise.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.912
Get out of your own way.

00:47:16.912 --> 00:47:18.870
The only person stopping
you from doing what it

00:47:18.870 --> 00:47:21.150
is that you want to do is you.

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:23.190
If you decide and
commit that you're not

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:24.940
going to take any
rubbish anymore,

00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:27.150
that you're not going to
settle for second best,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:30.530
that you want to actually live
the life that you want to live,

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:32.020
why not do it?

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.600
What's stopping you?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:36.990
Every single person who
has achieved anything great

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:38.640
has overcome adversity.

00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:42.690
Most people who are
world-renowned, great thinkers,

00:47:42.690 --> 00:47:43.830
great achievers--

00:47:43.830 --> 00:47:46.540
Einstein failed maths.

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:49.780
Walt Disney was
fired from his job.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.460
Guess why?

00:47:51.460 --> 00:47:54.400
For a lack of creativity.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:58.630
Michael Jordan was thrown
off his basketball team.

00:47:58.630 --> 00:48:01.180
All of these people failed.

00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:03.460
But here's how I want
you to think of it.

00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:05.230
There is no such
thing as failure.

00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:06.940
It's feedback.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.680
If something doesn't work out,
go, what can I do differently?

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.960
How can I do it differently?

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.340
Ask better questions.

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.380
And importantly, take action.

00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.440
If you just wish for
something, it's just a dream.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.410
But if you take action,
it becomes reality.

00:48:20.410 --> 00:48:22.330
And that is the gap in between.

00:48:22.330 --> 00:48:24.850
I used to wish
for a better life.

00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:30.010
Sometimes I prefer to trade
my life for nothing just

00:48:30.010 --> 00:48:32.410
to do away with it.

00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:33.310
That was then.

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:36.222
Now I make better questions.

00:48:36.222 --> 00:48:37.180
I ask better questions.

00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.650
I make better decisions.

00:48:38.650 --> 00:48:40.690
And I focus on better things.

00:48:40.690 --> 00:48:42.910
And importantly, I
take action on those.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:44.590
I don't wish anymore.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.030
If I want to do
something, I don't

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:47.276
have to know how to do it.

00:48:47.276 --> 00:48:48.900
I've just got to do
it and find someone

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:50.264
who's done it before me.

00:48:50.264 --> 00:48:52.180
Do you all know someone
who has done something

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:55.330
successful before you?

00:48:55.330 --> 00:48:56.320
Everybody has.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.300
Everybody knows
somebody like that.

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:00.220
Find the strategies,
and model them.

00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.390
And keep taking action.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:03.431
And keep doing it, and
keep doing it, and keeping

00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:05.440
do it until you get the
result that you want.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.560
And you will get the
result that you want.

00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:11.650
And remember the phrase we are
all born happy and successful.

00:49:11.650 --> 00:49:13.870
We are conditioned not to be.

00:49:13.870 --> 00:49:16.210
Now that you know
that, I want you

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.590
to be your best
version of yourselves

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:19.930
and reach your potential.

00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:21.920
And I'd like to thank
you on that note.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:32.840
CAROLINE: Thank you so much.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.910
I'm going to open maybe
one or two questions.

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.660
And we have only about
three minutes left,

00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:39.710
and then we'll go to audience
questions very quickly.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:43.840
Please wait until I go myself
or John get a microphone to you.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:46.860
So first question I
want to start with

00:49:46.860 --> 00:49:49.982
is after each of
the major events

00:49:49.982 --> 00:49:52.440
that you experienced and your
coming back and became really

00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:56.720
strong again, there must
have been lots of times

00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:00.540
when you wanted to give up.

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:02.260
What strategies did you use?

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:04.137
Or just why didn't you actually?

00:50:04.137 --> 00:50:05.095
Why didn't you give up?

00:50:05.095 --> 00:50:07.670
DONNA KENNEDY: I didn't give
up because I knew that there

00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:08.545
was something better.

00:50:08.545 --> 00:50:11.169
I didn't know how to do it, but
I knew that there was something

00:50:11.169 --> 00:50:11.760
better.

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:14.870
And I was sick of
seeing my parents upset.

00:50:14.870 --> 00:50:17.600
I watched other people
have what I wanted.

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.690
And I guess I just knew there
was a slight glimmer there

00:50:20.690 --> 00:50:22.670
that I might be able
to do if I could

00:50:22.670 --> 00:50:26.967
get the right people behind
me and the right resources.

00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:27.800
Who wants that hope?

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.610
Because when you've got a bit
of hope, you can do anything.

00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.210
So that's why I
grasped that hope,

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:36.080
and I also became very grateful
for everything that I have,

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.293
not what I don't have.

00:50:37.293 --> 00:50:40.280
CAROLINE: You clearly have had
lots of brilliant achievements.

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.141
What in your mind has been
your greatest achievement?

00:50:43.141 --> 00:50:44.390
DONNA KENNEDY: Having my baby.

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:46.504
CAROLINE: I thought
you'd mention Ashton.

00:50:46.504 --> 00:50:47.670
DONNA KENNEDY: It has to be.

00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:48.510
CAROLINE: Fantastic.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:50.134
DONNA KENNEDY: Yeah,
and you know what?

00:50:50.134 --> 00:50:51.290
That was bloody painful.

00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:54.850
I have to say, it was the
most painful thing ever.

00:50:54.850 --> 00:50:57.350
But sometimes it takes a bit
of pain to get great results.

00:50:57.350 --> 00:50:59.295
And yeah, that was my
greatest achievement.

00:50:59.295 --> 00:51:00.920
I've done all the
other stuff, but that

00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.419
was my greatest achievement.

00:51:02.419 --> 00:51:03.252
CAROLINE: Fantastic.

00:51:03.252 --> 00:51:06.365
Any audience questions?

00:51:06.365 --> 00:51:07.740
DONNA KENNEDY:
This is the point,

00:51:07.740 --> 00:51:09.390
and I said this to
Caroline beforehand,

00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:11.890
this is point where everyone
goes, I want to ask a question,

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:13.390
but I can't put
my hand up first.

00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:15.040
CAROLINE: I can't
be the first person.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:15.540
Anyone?

00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:18.496
Yes, great.

00:51:18.496 --> 00:51:22.550
AUDIENCE: So you made the
analogy of a computer.

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.805
And you said that everything is
a app you download or a program

00:51:25.805 --> 00:51:26.346
you download.

00:51:26.346 --> 00:51:29.870
But don't people,
and even children,

00:51:29.870 --> 00:51:33.050
are born with some
premade software?

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:37.170
Like share something
without people teaching them

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:37.916
how to share.

00:51:37.916 --> 00:51:40.582
DONNA KENNEDY: You can have that
as a physical-- but then again,

00:51:40.582 --> 00:51:41.920
this is neurological.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.444
So we download stuff, but it
becomes part of our neurology.

00:51:44.444 --> 00:51:46.360
So for example, if
somebody has down syndrome.

00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:47.260
And there's gene 21.

00:51:47.260 --> 00:51:50.800
And it's not working
as effectively

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.090
as maybe other people.

00:51:52.090 --> 00:51:53.820
That's part of their neurology.

00:51:53.820 --> 00:51:55.702
That's part of their
genetic makeup.

00:51:55.702 --> 00:51:57.160
But I don't believe
that people are

00:51:57.160 --> 00:52:03.280
born with emotional been
pessimists or been depressed.

00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:04.870
If you look at all
of the research,

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:06.950
every bit of research
that's out there,

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.310
it's all based on
behavior and thought.

00:52:09.310 --> 00:52:11.350
So what you see
and what you think

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:13.900
will literally affect the
chemicals in your body

00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:15.580
and in your neurology.

00:52:15.580 --> 00:52:18.180
If I think negatively,
cortisol and adrenaline

00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.570
are released in my body.

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:21.820
If I think a happy
thought or I look

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:25.210
at something positive, chemicals
such as norepinephrine,

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:28.350
serotonin, which
is antidepressants,

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.200
dopamine, they're all
flowed in my body.

00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.110
And that has a
physical response.

00:52:33.110 --> 00:52:35.950
It's where physically we all
look different because we

00:52:35.950 --> 00:52:37.450
have different genetic makeups.

00:52:37.450 --> 00:52:40.510
But on an emotional
level, it's neurological.

00:52:40.510 --> 00:52:42.336
And that can be changed.

00:52:42.336 --> 00:52:43.888
Does that answer your question?

00:52:43.888 --> 00:52:45.760
CAROLINE: OK, thank you, doll.

00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.480
Anybody else with one final
question you'd like to ask?

00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:51.905
OK, great.

00:52:51.905 --> 00:52:53.845
AUDIENCE: Hi, just
a quick question

00:52:53.845 --> 00:52:57.160
on-- so we have busy days and
everybody's always running

00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:58.150
and always go, go, go.

00:52:58.150 --> 00:53:01.266
Do you have any tips
on finding in yourself

00:53:01.266 --> 00:53:02.690
that really makes you tick?

00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:06.380
And you know, to find
that purpose to go after,

00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:08.200
in that sense,
instead of getting

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:10.626
lost in the day-to-day stuff.

00:53:10.626 --> 00:53:12.130
DONNA KENNEDY: Set a time.

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.820
Set aside time on one
day a week, one hour,

00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.640
one day a week to
take a pen and paper

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:22.180
and literally write down
on the top "my why."

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:23.450
Why is it that you want to do?

00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.260
You know what you want to do.

00:53:25.260 --> 00:53:27.170
It's just the condition
that's clouding it.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:28.570
But you know what
you want to do.

00:53:28.570 --> 00:53:31.260
Because when you get up
in the morning, you go,

00:53:31.260 --> 00:53:32.560
oh, I'd love to do this today.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.768
Or I'd love to do that today.

00:53:33.768 --> 00:53:36.070
Or if I said to you, are
you a creative person?

00:53:36.070 --> 00:53:38.260
And you go, yes
or no, whichever.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.200
Or are you someone who loves
like an adrenaline buzz?

00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:42.100
You'd say yes or no.

00:53:42.100 --> 00:53:44.141
You'd know those questions
because they're better

00:53:44.141 --> 00:53:45.700
questions to ask yourself.

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.230
So what kind of a person am I?

00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:48.550
What do I enjoy?

00:53:48.550 --> 00:53:51.310
What makes me go, yes, I
really, really enjoy that.

00:53:51.310 --> 00:53:53.980
Or are you a people
kind of person?

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.459
If you're a people person and
you take on a solitary job,

00:53:56.459 --> 00:53:58.000
you're never going
to be happy in it.

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.062
So when you start to write
out what is it that's your why

00:54:01.062 --> 00:54:02.770
or play around with
it rather than trying

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:04.690
to be stiff with
it, just play around

00:54:04.690 --> 00:54:06.250
with what it is
that you want to do.

00:54:06.250 --> 00:54:07.840
Then you put the
passion behind it.

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.570
You'll only get passion
when you try it out.

00:54:10.570 --> 00:54:13.365
Honestly, most people here
and in the rest of the world

00:54:13.365 --> 00:54:15.490
don't know what they want
to do simply because they

00:54:15.490 --> 00:54:17.779
haven't asked themselves.

00:54:17.779 --> 00:54:19.570
If you ask a child,
what do you want to be?

00:54:19.570 --> 00:54:22.600
I want to be Superman,
or I want to be a nurse,

00:54:22.600 --> 00:54:25.120
or I want to be a
doctor, or whatever.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.330
It's not necessarily that they
do, but in that moment they do.

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:29.680
So they just don't question it.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:31.830
And the adults go, yay,
oh, isn't that lovely?

00:54:31.830 --> 00:54:32.860
That's so cute.

00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.890
So they get a reward for it.

00:54:34.890 --> 00:54:37.497
Or if a child does something,
everyone celebrates.

00:54:37.497 --> 00:54:39.830
If a child stands up and walks
and takes the first step,

00:54:39.830 --> 00:54:41.260
everyone celebrates.

00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:43.690
So if you start asking
yourself positive questions

00:54:43.690 --> 00:54:45.850
and then you celebrate
those questions

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:48.550
or reward yourself when you
do something that you love,

00:54:48.550 --> 00:54:50.774
your brain will start to
physically respond to it.

00:54:50.774 --> 00:54:51.940
There's a part of our brain.

00:54:51.940 --> 00:54:53.981
Some people consider a
part of the limbic system.

00:54:53.981 --> 00:54:55.750
It's called the anterior
cingulate cortex.

00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:59.530
And what that does is that
is responsible for rewards,

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.260
impulses, and desires.

00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:03.790
And that part of the
brain, especially in women,

00:55:03.790 --> 00:55:07.180
activates very, very easily
when you give yourself a reward

00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.696
and it tags it to the
thing that you're doing.

00:55:09.696 --> 00:55:11.610
CAROLINE: OK, thank
you very much.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.080
So for the last 30
seconds, final question

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.509
is who inspires you?

00:55:17.509 --> 00:55:18.550
DONNA KENNEDY: My mother.

00:55:18.550 --> 00:55:20.800
She passed away two years
ago, but everything that she

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:22.540
taught me has inspired me.

00:55:22.540 --> 00:55:25.420
Now I know people think, should
be some celebrity or somebody

00:55:25.420 --> 00:55:27.170
that's what everybody knows.

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:29.500
But for me being the
best that you can be

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.970
and having good
morals and values

00:55:30.970 --> 00:55:33.130
and having good integrity,
that inspires me.

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.734
I don't care who the person is.

00:55:34.734 --> 00:55:35.650
So my mother for sure.

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:37.990
She taught me how to be
grateful for everything

00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:40.370
that I have, not in a grateful
for your dinner in a way.

00:55:40.370 --> 00:55:42.119
Or there's people
starving somewhere else,

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:43.360
and you should be grateful.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:47.750
In a way that to genuinely
appreciate if these were gone,

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:50.830
would you give me a billion
euro for your hands?

00:55:50.830 --> 00:55:52.810
Not a hope.

00:55:52.810 --> 00:55:55.900
But yet everyone just takes
for granted what they have.

00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:58.750
Would you give me a billion
euro for your clothes?

00:55:58.750 --> 00:56:00.820
Not a hope.

00:56:00.820 --> 00:56:04.540
If you had to take them off and
try to go around everywhere.

00:56:04.540 --> 00:56:08.530
You might get them to be at
home with whatever transaction.

00:56:08.530 --> 00:56:11.584
Would you give me your
eyes for a billion euro?

00:56:11.584 --> 00:56:14.000
But most of us think we have
to be grateful for everything

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.467
out there, where my mother,
she inspired me to understand.

00:56:16.467 --> 00:56:18.425
I suppose at the beginning,
out of desperation,

00:56:18.425 --> 00:56:20.630
but to understand that the
stuff that you actually

00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:23.210
have if you become
grateful for it,

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:25.529
you actually become
a stronger person.

00:56:25.529 --> 00:56:28.070
Every day-- and it's something
that she taught me from when I

00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:30.140
was about five--

00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.670
she said, say 10
things that you're

00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:34.070
grateful for every
day, 10 things.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:37.286
And it's very hard to stop
at 10 once you start going.

00:56:37.286 --> 00:56:38.328
I'm grateful for my eyes.

00:56:38.328 --> 00:56:39.411
I'm grateful for my hands.

00:56:39.411 --> 00:56:40.650
I'm grateful for my big toe.

00:56:40.650 --> 00:56:42.480
If it was gone, I'd hate it.

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:44.729
I'm grateful for the
seat that I sit in.

00:56:44.729 --> 00:56:46.020
I'm grateful there's heat here.

00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:48.644
I'm grateful that we're
in a safe environment.

00:56:48.644 --> 00:56:49.810
And the list goes on and on.

00:56:49.810 --> 00:56:51.309
But as soon as you
start to do that,

00:56:51.309 --> 00:56:53.580
your brain starts to open
up and think differently.

00:56:53.580 --> 00:56:54.900
So she inspires me the most.

00:56:54.900 --> 00:56:55.290
CAROLINE: That's great.

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:56.070
Thank you very much.

00:56:56.070 --> 00:56:56.570
So--

00:56:56.570 --> 00:56:59.720
[APPLAUSE]
