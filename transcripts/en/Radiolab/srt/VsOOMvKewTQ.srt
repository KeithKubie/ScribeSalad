1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:05,560
Okay. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich webs. Oh my, let's talk.

2
00:00:05,830 --> 00:00:09,860
Yeah, do it. Oh, I'm Molly Webster.
Yeah. Just graduated and party,

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,310
join the party. And uh, today
we have a, I don't know,

4
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:18,840
we have a birth story. We're calling this
birth story because that's what it is.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,710
We're going to tell you about babies who
were very recently born and who one day

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:27,870
will turn to their parents and say to
them, tell me how I got here. Like what's,

7
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,700
what's, what's my story? What's my story?
And the parents in this case will say,

8
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:36,490
well that's complicated. That's, yeah.

9
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,260
This is one where the kids will hear
what we're, you're about to hear.

10
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,700
And they'll go, really,

11
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,410
it's a collaboration with a team of
reporters in Israel called Israel story.

12
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,030
They, a group of folks who do sort of
long form reporting and storytelling.

13
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:53,910
They'd been doing it in Hebrew for three
years and they are in the middle of

14
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:57,900
their first English language season
right now, which we're going to be in.

15
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,380
Exactly. And uh, this is a two producers
that we worked with in particular,

16
00:01:01,381 --> 00:01:06,090
Maya Kosovar. And you'll high Mattel
and a, this story begins with Maya.

17
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:06,680
Okay.

18
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,330
It was party. We were all dancing
Israeli music in the middle of Jaffa.

19
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,500
Mr Birthday. They were at her
apartment and it's guy tall.

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:19,670
How was dancing with his partner? These
are friends of yours. Yeah. Tallies.

21
00:01:19,671 --> 00:01:24,671
Kind of mega star in the deaf community
in Israel because he translates the news

22
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,340
in the TV to deaf people to sign language.

23
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,890
Oh well so he's like the little
guy in the corner of the TV. Yeah.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,903
And his partner,

25
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:36,910
a man Amir or a meal with an r is a
psychologist that works specially with

26
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:42,440
children that are autistic. Huh.
Anyway, they're at the party.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,940
So we were dancing all
together and then a pal was,

28
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,691
oh my God,

29
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:51,350
maybe it's going to be the list party
that I'm in because I'm going to be a

30
00:01:51,351 --> 00:01:54,170
parent and not only a parent,

31
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:56,360
I'm going to be a father for three.

32
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:01,130
And then we were like,
oh my God, three babies,

33
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,070
how's that going to happen?

34
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,700
And it turns out how that
was going to happen is a

35
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,460
crazy story involving a four
countries, women, two guys.

36
00:02:13,461 --> 00:02:17,360
And three babies as we mentioned.
And planes, jet planes, two of them,

37
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,580
hundreds of thousands
of the, at least four.

38
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:24,370
Yes. So yes, all that. But we
should, we should go back a bit

39
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,620
to the beginning. The first

40
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,300
speaking of that I started in [inaudible]
is, Eh, is his ability to be a father.

41
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,230
This is a mirror.

42
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,480
Really? Yeah. How so?

43
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:40,530
Because a, it was a good man, you
know, he was very, uh, gentle,

44
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:44,800
a little bit and really an adults, eh,

45
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:47,540
to be in the family. I don't
know how to describe it though.

46
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,283
Thanks.

47
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,050
Did you see that like on first meeting
or was this like four months in

48
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,510
my career is established work with the
district people and to take notice for

49
00:03:01,511 --> 00:03:06,430
every sign though of communication and a,

50
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,000
and to understand that the
people and to analyze them.

51
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,460
So it was really immediate. They said,

52
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:17,290
let's say after two or
three times you say,

53
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,880
okay, Eh, I want children.
So yeah. Are you interesting?

54
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:25,030
I wrote a manifesto about my
future. What I want to do,

55
00:03:25,031 --> 00:03:26,290
what I want to do in my career.

56
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:31,030
It's kind of my vision and I gave it to
him and I said this and this is what I

57
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:36,010
want. A sign at the bottom, please. Yeah,

58
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:41,150
that was a contract. It's like this is
what I want. If you want to join me, Eh,

59
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:44,500
so let's do it. So let's do it and
tell. What was your reaction to the,

60
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:47,980
to the manifesto? I like it.

61
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,330
It's look like someone who want a future.

62
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:53,440
It's your own parents.

63
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:58,470
Have any either of your parents have
any views about that saying don't do or

64
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,700
that's weird. Yeah.

65
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:08,170
Suffice to say their
families did not approve,

66
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,680
especially when it came to
the idea of them having kids.

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:18,040
Now how to have those kids. That
is a question. Basically there,

68
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,300
there are two options. If you're
a gay couple and you want to have,

69
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,810
there used to be three
options. That's you Chi.

70
00:04:22,811 --> 00:04:26,540
My towel from Israel story here is
how he and Maya laid it out for us.

71
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,180
Option number one, which is
now not as much of an option.

72
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:31,220
You could adopt a kid from
a third world country,

73
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,610
but he says over the last few years
what happened is that those third world

74
00:04:34,611 --> 00:04:39,611
countries figured out who was adopting
their babies and one by one they banned

75
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:43,010
it for gay couples. The second
option, which is becoming very,

76
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,410
very popular in Israel is
sort of the new family.

77
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:49,190
That's what it's called in Hebrew at least
sort of getting together with another

78
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:53,330
woman who wants to be a mother but
doesn't have a father and then they do a

79
00:04:53,331 --> 00:04:55,850
joint parenthood. They all
live in the same house? No,

80
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,120
the mother lives separately and it's
kind of like divorced parents that get

81
00:04:59,121 --> 00:04:59,840
along really well.

82
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,840
They sign a contract before the process
and everything is like in the contract

83
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,230
telling them your said that
early on they tried this route,

84
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,240
eh? [inaudible] from one of his
friend to do the coparenting,

85
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,910
but then I spoke with
Talend, ask him, listen,

86
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:21,410
it's very important for me to have
a baby of my own and with my sperm.

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,340
And I said to [inaudible] I want to try,

88
00:05:25,341 --> 00:05:30,140
but I don't care if in the end we
have only one baby in your sperm,

89
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:33,620
so it will be my baby the same.

90
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:37,170
I think I was more stubborn
about it. [inaudible]

91
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,390
Amir couldn't really explain
why it was so important to him,

92
00:05:40,391 --> 00:05:43,900
just that it was important to him.
But reflecting on it later, my, uh,

93
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:45,520
from Israel's story, put it this way,

94
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,680
it's very Jewish and Israeli. I mean,

95
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,530
if you're not in the Israeli mainstream,

96
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,520
if you are gay or if you are different
and you'll have your own baby,

97
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,220
it's like a, of being

98
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,840
part of the game, you know,

99
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,790
whatever the reasons. A Amir and tall,

100
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:05,540
talked it over and then they went back
to this woman tells Fran who had offered

101
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,440
to do the coparenting

102
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:11,570
and we asked her if she can obligate
to us to bring two children,

103
00:06:11,701 --> 00:06:14,460
one of of thous berms and one of my own.

104
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:18,310
In the end she said no. And at
this point a year had gone by.

105
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:18,681
Well.

106
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:23,681
So then we've decided that maybe the
best option will be option three is,

107
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,640
is surrogacy

108
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,000
[inaudible]

109
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,550
meeting. Of course, if you're a
gay man that you take your sperm,

110
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,960
take some eggs from a woman,

111
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:36,140
put your sperm and those eggs
into the womb of a second woman

112
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
who carries the baby to term.

113
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,380
But surrogacy is illegal in Israel
only for gay couples. Yeah. In Israel,

114
00:06:43,381 --> 00:06:46,440
if you're a Hetero couple, you can
use an Israeli woman as a surrogate.

115
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:49,110
But if you're gay you can't.
So there's a big problem.

116
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:53,610
But that problem also creates a
big demand, as you can imagine,

117
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,010
are quite a lot of gay couples in Israel.

118
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,490
And so a company's spraying up basically
offering international brokering of

119
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,530
sperm eggs and uh, ovaries,

120
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:06,853
babies outsourcing

121
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:10,700
[inaudible]

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,150
Harlem. And they don't meet the Moose.

123
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,780
You can see this play out every year at
these conferences in Israel conferences

124
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:18,000
where they'd get prospective
parents together.

125
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:21,330
We are here for our first time in Tel
Aviv, so it's this big room of people,

126
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,850
several hundred people, Pretty
Michelle Gay men. Pardon me,

127
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:27,450
for not being able to speak
Hebrew very well or at all Shalom.

128
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,780
Basically what happened to
these conferences is that
surrogacy agencies will get

129
00:07:30,781 --> 00:07:32,990
up and basically sell their products.

130
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,740
We now offer surrogacy in
Mexico, Thailand, Anima,

131
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,520
the United States, India. Anybody
been to fort worth? Very nice place.

132
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:44,490
You can go see a basketball
game and go see a baseball game.

133
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:49,130
These agencies will find women in all
of these places who will serve as the

134
00:07:49,131 --> 00:07:52,190
surrogate for your child and depending
on which country you choose and whether

135
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:57,080
or not you provide the donor eggs or
they do, or a million other factors,

136
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,460
the costs will vary.

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,760
We offer very, uh, competitive
prices. For example,

138
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:05,030
$36,000 complete start
to finish in Mexico.

139
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,250
38,000 in Thailand,

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,720
anywhere from 65,000 to 85,000, 150,000.

141
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,010
It could be that much.

142
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,600
That's excluding the donor of course.

143
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:18,170
But we have a good selection of donors
including uh, Jewish donors as well.

144
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,350
Yeah. The have session with the
lawyers. You have session with families,

145
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:25,830
you have sessions with doctors
telling them your went to two of these

146
00:08:25,831 --> 00:08:26,664
conferences,

147
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:30,450
success of years and coming back from
the second one we take a calculator and

148
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,910
you start how we can make
it raising money. Money,

149
00:08:35,911 --> 00:08:36,750
money. Yeah.

150
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,900
They figure if they go with a company
that does surrogacy in the u s it's

151
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:44,901
probably going to cost $150,000
or is that lawyers and lawyers,

152
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:50,750
the hospital, the spare
delivery, uh, the egg donor, uh,

153
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:52,920
there is a lot of people
that we need to pay

154
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,830
and he says, keep in mind
when you pay that money,

155
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:59,010
you are not guaranteed a baby.
You'll buy a process. Yeah.

156
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,690
We don't buy a baby.

157
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,670
One of our friends did this kind of
process and they spend five times and they

158
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:08,430
still didn't succeed five times. Yeah.

159
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,510
They figured with that kind of risk do
we get in the u s was just too expensive

160
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,930
and so they started looking at surrogacy
agencies which operate in India,

161
00:09:15,931 --> 00:09:20,100
in Nepal because over there you can do
the same thing and it will cost you about

162
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:24,780
$60,000 so it's almost half price,
almost a half price. Yeah. Now

163
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,380
one of the tricky things according to
get high is that in 2013 India basically

164
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:34,190
outlawed surrogacy for
gay couples. I mean you,

165
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,290
if you're a straight couple
you can do surrogacy in India,

166
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,160
but not if you're gay.

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,150
Also in a part by the way in Nepal also
outlawed surrogacy effectively that

168
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:45,990
Kevin had said, if you are a Nepali
woman, you cannot be a surrogate period,

169
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,120
but there's sort of a loophole.

170
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,210
Indian women are allowed to
be surrogates in the pilot.

171
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:53,520
Just Nepali women aren't allowed
to be surrogates in Nepal.

172
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,100
So what ends up happening is
it's really strange situation.

173
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,300
It looks like it puzzle.

174
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:02,330
These agents in northern India will
find Indian woman move them across the

175
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:03,660
border into Nepal.

176
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:07,650
I'll take them all the way to Kathmandu
where the surrogacy agencies have set up

177
00:10:07,651 --> 00:10:10,560
shelter houses and work with
local hospitals and clinics.

178
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:17,880
My assessed for talent, Amir, the
decision to do it this way was not easy.

179
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,910
They had like different opinions that
had the bigger issue with the more rural

180
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,660
concept of this process. Amelia was like,

181
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,970
this is the thing that we need to do.
I want to be a father. But Pal was,

182
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,300
it was very hard for him.

183
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:39,140
I thought the, if it's, it's
a moral to do things like that

184
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,130
[inaudible]

185
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:46,130
to use and other woman to give
me a presence like that and,

186
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,650
and I know she will never
will see this baby anymore.

187
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:57,930
Is it a moral, because you're essentially
like just using a woman's body or

188
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:01,780
eh, yeah. Yeah. You can say

189
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,990
he felt like he's using other
people bad luck for his own good.

190
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:11,470
Yeah. She has no choice. She's
not doing it out of freedom.

191
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:16,740
She's just doing it for the money and
maybe it's not morally okay that will use

192
00:11:16,841 --> 00:11:21,490
this weakness telling me or went
back and forth on this for months.

193
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:26,380
And eventually the argument
that won the day was this did,

194
00:11:26,381 --> 00:11:29,260
if they're going to do it, they're going
to do it with this agency called Lotus,

195
00:11:29,261 --> 00:11:34,261
which to their understanding
paid the surrogate's $12,000.

196
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,700
I mean, the surrogates were
actually paid in Indian rupees,

197
00:11:36,701 --> 00:11:39,580
but that would be the
dollar equivalent. $12,000.

198
00:11:39,581 --> 00:11:42,220
Now for a rural woman in India,

199
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:47,020
that is a massive sum of money. They
figured this won't just help her survive,

200
00:11:47,021 --> 00:11:48,670
it will change her life.

201
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,080
She'll be changing their life and
they'll be changing hers. Maybe this,

202
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,210
um, kind of like comfort.
Yeah. They get money.

203
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,300
They can change their
life. They can buy a house,

204
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:05,710
they can send the her
children to school, Eh,

205
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,540
to learn in the university.
When I felt and understand it's,

206
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,150
would it be a life
changer? And the, it's not

207
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,790
exploiting it. It's
bloating are so I agree.

208
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,320
Mm.

209
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,520
At the start of the whole process,

210
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,620
one of the main issue was to peak the
egg donor and like who are these women?

211
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:31,460
Like where do they come from?
Ukraine. They're from the Ukraine.

212
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,020
They're all Ukrainian. What is that?

213
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:36,560
That is not a country I expected to
be thrown into the mix of countries.

214
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,760
The reason the eggs are from
eastern Europe are generally
because was a no white

215
00:12:40,761 --> 00:12:44,000
because they're white, so it's like
cheap white eggs. She pointed eggs.

216
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,380
That's quite a phrase.

217
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:53,260
So you have like a website and you see
a lot of pictures of women and then you

218
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:57,420
need to choose the most Eh, like JD? Yeah.

219
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,310
Jewish online dating service. Yeah.

220
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:05,350
I think it was the most straighty ish
act that I did in a very long time.

221
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,520
Oh, straightest nice. You're
picking out a lady's? Yeah. Yeah.

222
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:13,040
How did you decide which criteria
you wanted an a donor mom. Oh,

223
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,760
the first one was high. You
wanted someone tall? Yeah. Why?

224
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:21,070
Why was height your first
one? Because it's smart.

225
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,690
Easy to lose it. Yeah. When
your height. Yeah. Okay.

226
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,990
Then eyes. She has the speak eyes.

227
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:35,010
They showed my a picture light brown
here and she has this nice nose.

228
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,060
If was, you know, very strange.

229
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:42,350
It was very uncomfortable to
choose for me. It was very uh, eh.

230
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:47,900
[inaudible], Eh, genetical
uh, improving. Oh.

231
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,590
Jenica Janay eugenics. Huh?

232
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,800
Now since telling them your head, each
one at a baby with their own sperm,

233
00:13:57,801 --> 00:14:01,970
they told Lotus we would
like to rent two wombs,

234
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:06,710
one of each sperm, and to try to
use like two surrogate mothers.

235
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,671
Lotus said, fine.

236
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:12,500
That's going to run you about
50 $60,000 each pregnancy.

237
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,820
Again, no guarantees,

238
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:18,890
so telling the mirror they'd give
lotus their sperm and little cups.

239
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:22,760
Lotus raises the sperm, sends it to a
hospital. In Nepal, the Ukrainian woman,

240
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,650
the egg donor is flown to Nepal.

241
00:14:24,651 --> 00:14:28,400
Her eggs are harvested somewhere
along the way to north Indian.

242
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:31,460
Women are moved across the
border into Nepal. Finally,

243
00:14:31,461 --> 00:14:34,100
the doctors at that Nepali
hospital take the Israeli sperm,

244
00:14:34,101 --> 00:14:38,660
injected into the Ukrainian eggs,
create some embryos and the implant.

245
00:14:38,661 --> 00:14:42,860
Those embryos in the wounds of the
Indian surrogates for countries.

246
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,370
One baby, a few months go by.

247
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:50,030
They get the news that both surrogates
are pregnant. The process worked.

248
00:14:50,031 --> 00:14:51,980
One is pregnant with three babies and

249
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,510
all their scent, sonograms, pictures
of the surrogate's, pregnant bellies.

250
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,590
I all the time,

251
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:02,650
look on the picture of her
all the ultrasound pictures
all the time looking on

252
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,680
my cell phone. In the picture it tells,

253
00:15:06,681 --> 00:15:09,410
says there wasn't really much he could
do cause for three or four or five

254
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:12,910
months, not much happened until

255
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,660
[inaudible] six months, six o'clock
in the six o'clock in the morning.

256
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:23,690
Donna from Lotto call us and the Amir
was answered the phone and they hear him

257
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:28,770
say, okay, they're okay.

258
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,980
I wake up and say what? Because

259
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:35,600
it was too early, too early. How early?

260
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,660
About eight to eight weeks. A head. Wow.

261
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,080
The surrogate who was carrying twins
had given birth. I was crying a lot.

262
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,450
This is the surrogate caring tiles
baby, which turned out to be two babies.

263
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:49,160
Yeah, and were you on the plane?

264
00:15:49,161 --> 00:15:54,161
The same day is getting the color and
day after we fly from Tel Aviv to instant

265
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,100
bull and from Instanbul
tool couple months.

266
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:05,510
It was very crazy today.

267
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:11,000
Then gala, this is one of tiles friends
who was also in Nepal for surrogacy.

268
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,780
Took me to the hospital and

269
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,383
well

270
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,290
I was shocked

271
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:29,190
because Gilly was so tiny.

272
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:34,010
Gilly was 3.8 pounds. His brother,
you have all 4.8 pounds and

273
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:39,730
yeah, I was very scared to touch him.

274
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,380
He says he expected the twins
sustain the hospital for a month.

275
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,800
But the nurses were like,
nope, going home tomorrow.

276
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,030
I thought they don't ever enough time
to think because I understand tomorrow I

277
00:16:53,031 --> 00:16:55,490
need to take them home and to be alone

278
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,490
and I never take care of in the babies.

279
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,980
So I said, I said to the nurses,

280
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,230
teach me out to feed them.

281
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,640
After three days I took them home.

282
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:18,490
So where was the surrogate during
these days? Was she at the hospital?

283
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,760
I think she was in the hospital. Yeah,

284
00:17:20,830 --> 00:17:24,250
because she had the [inaudible] surgery.

285
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:28,300
I was ask if she's okay
and if she needs something.

286
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,810
They said you cannot see her until she
signed all the papers and then you can

287
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:39,940
see her. The papers
hadn't been signed. Yeah,

288
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:40,930
because we need that.

289
00:17:40,931 --> 00:17:45,931
She's giving up all her
maternal lay rights and if
she doesn't want to sign this

290
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:50,214
paper

291
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:51,600
we can lose the baby.

292
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,640
The last on this game,
crazily complicated. But
basically they needed Israel,

293
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:00,700
India and Nepal to all recognize that
they were the uncontested parents and as

294
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,630
all legal rights and hanging in the air.

295
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:05,630
We've been terrified was
the recent case in Thailand,

296
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,340
which is all over the
news where the surrogate,

297
00:18:07,530 --> 00:18:11,690
which right after the baby was born
changed her mind lake and his husband and

298
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:16,280
believed this surrogate decided to try
and keep the baby because she found out

299
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:17,203
they were gay.

300
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,490
We had a little bit of an anxiety,

301
00:18:19,491 --> 00:18:24,491
let's say they will going to know that
their baby's going to grow in the house

302
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:26,270
with through that

303
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:31,410
any case tall is in Nepal with the
twins. Amir is back in Tel Aviv.

304
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,330
A couple of weeks go by and then

305
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,700
eh called me and said the [inaudible].

306
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:43,110
The second surrogate had given
birth one baby and they after

307
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,103
you

308
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:49,380
[inaudible] one from symbol tool Linda

309
00:18:53,670 --> 00:18:57,900
and then it was very, very,
very nice that we went, eh,

310
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,940
only asked with the babies. We'll let
no parents, no friends, no phone phones,

311
00:19:02,941 --> 00:19:07,050
no wall to build the first Eh, Eh,

312
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,320
blocks of our relationship
with the babies.

313
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,310
Some [inaudible]

314
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,470
and for the next month they
lived in an apartment in Nepal,

315
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,200
just them and their three babies.

316
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,150
[inaudible] learning
to be dads [inaudible]

317
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:37,780
being a goose and waiting for the
paperwork to be done. What's the bands?

318
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,543
So

319
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:45,190
now the paperwork incidentally is a beast
because after the surrogate sign away,

320
00:19:45,191 --> 00:19:45,761
their rights,

321
00:19:45,761 --> 00:19:49,240
the babies have no nationality and
then they're suddenly illegally in the

322
00:19:49,241 --> 00:19:53,500
country. So then the guys have to
take a DNA test, send it to Israel,

323
00:19:53,501 --> 00:19:56,980
get it verified, then they've got
to get a passport for the babies.

324
00:19:57,010 --> 00:20:02,010
Then several sets of visas need to be
gotten and all of that means multiple

325
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,080
trips to these Railey embassy.

326
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,130
And it was on one of those trips
that they learned something.

327
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,580
It was really weird because we went over
there with our eight kids to get the

328
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:18,350
passport and over there there was
another surrogate from a different agency

329
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,920
in Indian woman and standing next to
her was in Israeli woman who happened to

330
00:20:21,921 --> 00:20:22,580
speak Hindi.

331
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,260
And we just go, you know,
out of curiosity, we eh,

332
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:30,110
asked her to ask the surrogate in Hindu,

333
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,160
eh, how much she's, Eh,

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,950
she's getting for the whole process. Yeah.

335
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:40,250
But the surrogate was very shy. Yes.

336
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:43,760
Not Very delighted to speak about the
money, which made them even more curious.

337
00:20:43,761 --> 00:20:48,280
So they persisted and then Eh,
we discovered she gets only

338
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,740
3000 to use stole or something like that.

339
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,823
Yes.

340
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,860
$3,000 for the whole pregnancy.
Amir was like, wait a second

341
00:20:58,890 --> 00:20:59,960
in the agreement,

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,530
$12,500 supposed to go to the surrogate.

343
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,180
That was at least his understanding.

344
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,150
Now this was a different woman from a
different agency and this was just one

345
00:21:09,151 --> 00:21:13,940
woman's account. But
still in your narrative,

346
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:18,941
you've described that you thought that
the reason that this was okay to do the

347
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:22,450
surrogacy is because you
are using the phrase users.

348
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:27,110
This will make a change in the life of
the woman that was a life changing sum of

349
00:21:27,111 --> 00:21:27,944
money.

350
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,370
So Maya says they walked away from that
meeting wondering if they should do

351
00:21:31,371 --> 00:21:34,580
something in Israel, you know, call
the agency at the very least. Say, hey,

352
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:37,040
we heard some rumors, I'm sure they're
not true, but what do you think?

353
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:40,940
We started to ask question, but
then literally the next day,

354
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,830
[inaudible] ran the scenes of death and
destruction from Nepal today after a

355
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:52,060
powerful earthquake that
started outside Putman

356
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:01,800
[inaudible] death toll is now over 5,800,

357
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,630
nearly 14,000

358
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,850
[inaudible] officials

359
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:12,780
say it is the most destructive earthquake
to hit Nepal in more than 80 years.

360
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:16,260
The death toll would ultimately rise to
somewhere between seven and 10 years.

361
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,370
A thousand Maya says
she was in New York, uh,

362
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,870
in a meeting and she gets
this voicemail from Tal

363
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:29,110
[inaudible] [inaudible]
and he was shouting

364
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,000
in earthquake. Just happened here.

365
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,020
We saved the babies and we got down
to the street where half naked,

366
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,500
we don't know what to do. And
he's crying over there and then

367
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,483
[inaudible]

368
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,370
it suddenly stopped the,
he lost the connection.

369
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:54,640
Mm. It was, uh, like 12 hours
with no connection to them.

370
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,610
We didn't know if they're alive
or not. You know, everything was

371
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:01,670
unknown. Yeah.

372
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:06,670
I don't know how baton took his
cell phone and we just ran barefoot.

373
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,220
Mayor says they ran out of the
apartment down the street, half naked,

374
00:23:10,221 --> 00:23:13,760
holding the babies and the phone on the
way. They ran into their friend Gil,

375
00:23:13,761 --> 00:23:16,340
who had four babies and another
couple who had two babies.

376
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:21,180
We are in this treat
and we are nine babies.

377
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:24,280
[inaudible]

378
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,850
they actually shot a video on [inaudible]
phone. You see tall only in shorts.

379
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,760
I don't have to go with this with a
look at a bunch of other couples holding

380
00:23:30,761 --> 00:23:35,650
babies and they're all literally
standing on a pile of rubber

381
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,910
as they're standing there. A
guy with a badge, walks, walks

382
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,060
by y'all policeman. I love
you all from the a American.

383
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,070
Yes,

384
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:50,570
we are Israeli citizen.
We have nine, nine babies.

385
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,320
We need El please. We don't have
food for the babies. Okay, thank you.

386
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:59,240
Go from this chase very quickly
to go from here. Thank you.

387
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:07,120
So they took us in to the embassy,

388
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:11,020
the u s embassy or the Israeli embassy.

389
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:15,760
They went to the Israeli embassy and
the Israeli embassy sort of went into

390
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:20,740
emergency mode, gave us a some
blankets and hay put up, put out tents.

391
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:25,930
And shortly after the news cameras
arrived from Tal Tyler is a palace.

392
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,230
He's like in the media and
stuff because he's the,

393
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,460
he's the sign language translator.

394
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,120
And so he realized that he doesn't have
any way of communicating back home that

395
00:24:34,121 --> 00:24:35,200
he's alive. So you, hi,

396
00:24:35,201 --> 00:24:38,590
says a towels shoved his way in front
of one of the television cameras.

397
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,290
[inaudible] my name started signing
12 hours after the earthquake.

398
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,640
Maya says she got a call from her partner
back in Tel Aviv and she said they're

399
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:53,020
on the news now. Good mothering.
I can see tiles speaking,

400
00:24:53,021 --> 00:24:56,920
sign language to his parents saying
everything is okay, they are alive.

401
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:02,050
Three babies are with them and they are
waiting to their rescue team to come and

402
00:25:02,201 --> 00:25:03,034
take them.

403
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:08,730
But what the camera's also captured
was the scene that hadn't really been

404
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:12,910
grasped yet. Cause this whole thing
has been going on kind of quietly.

405
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:15,430
Now you have an international earthquake.

406
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:19,210
Everybody's watching the television and
in the middle of the story they're like

407
00:25:19,211 --> 00:25:23,830
10 Israeli babies and gay people and
all this. It was more than that. Babies.

408
00:25:23,831 --> 00:25:28,060
Yeah. How many were
there? 24 on babies. 2024

409
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,043
um

410
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:34,910
wow. Yes. Whoa. Because there
is another agency that also,

411
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,760
it's like all of a sudden you realize
there's this pipeline of babies. Yes,

412
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:43,260
I'm moving from Nepal to Israel. Yeah.

413
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:50,460
[inaudible] Maya says when the images of
those 24 babies splashed across Israeli

414
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:55,030
TV screens was like the first time
that this other Augustine was eh,

415
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,210
discussed in the Israeli media such
way. She says, a huge debate broke out.

416
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:04,890
One side of the argument was, okay,
we are using women and it's Eh,

417
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:08,220
it's unmoral. And from the
other hand there was like, okay,

418
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:12,210
in Israel for gay couples, they
don't have a lot of choices. I mean,

419
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,810
and everyone was asking, what do we do
with all these babies and the surrogates?

420
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,790
There was like a huge argument in the
Israeli media about the questions of there

421
00:26:20,791 --> 00:26:25,690
are women that are waiting to give birth
and we need to bring them to Israel to,

422
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:28,260
to give birth here cause
the fathers are here.

423
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:31,500
So they would fly the women to Israel,
have the baby and then fly them back.

424
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:35,440
Yes, they was talking about it. Yeah.
They talked about it. But I don't know.

425
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:39,130
I think the [inaudible] they could
not do that because that just,

426
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,410
it feels like kidnapping a lady. Yeah.

427
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,400
And so what happened was that very quickly

428
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:49,430
Israel sent over a search and rescue
and medical aid delegation in all the

429
00:26:50,221 --> 00:26:51,690
babies and their parents.

430
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,400
They were basically just all put on
a plane and sort of the process was

431
00:26:56,401 --> 00:26:58,830
expedited and they just brought
everybody over to Israel.

432
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:01,300
[inaudible]

433
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,520
back in Israel, a parade of newborns.

434
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,910
It will celebrate together knowing the
medical stress they've been through.

435
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,570
I'm very much aware of that. Many
in Nepal are still going through it.

436
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:14,080
So what happened to the
surrogates? Any idea

437
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,480
they checked with the agency, what is
the situation with the surrogate mothers?

438
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:23,481
And the answer was that two of them
are becking in the already and the warn

439
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,200
there in the earthquake.

440
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:28,140
And what about all the surrogates who are
in the Pol but hadn't given birth yet?

441
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:30,920
Yeah, I mean about them.
There's a big question.

442
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:35,930
I mean no one knows there were
like a worried fathers in Israel.

443
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:38,480
It's terrifying. All my thoughts,

444
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,620
all my prayers are for the surrogate
mother and for the unborn child

445
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,970
telling him your made it back to Israel
with their babies. They were fine.

446
00:27:45,971 --> 00:27:50,350
But there was still a lot of questions
and if I were one of you guys,

447
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,080
I would still be
wondering after all these,

448
00:27:53,081 --> 00:27:57,220
both of these women gave you as
you point out, a remarkable gift.

449
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Both of you believe that you hope rather
both of you hope that that gift was

450
00:28:03,461 --> 00:28:05,830
well rewarded and it was life changing.

451
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:10,630
But both of you don't know at this point
you're just a little suspicious that

452
00:28:10,631 --> 00:28:11,500
maybe it wasn't.

453
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,150
And don't you have this funny feeling
that you need to find out whether they got

454
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:17,980
paid what you thought you'd paid them?

455
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:19,130
Yes. Like,

456
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:24,020
this is why we're so glad that we made
the connection with you guys and we heard

457
00:28:24,021 --> 00:28:25,010
that you can,

458
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,380
hey, hi. And then maybe, yeah, so

459
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,583
yeah,

460
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,180
we started a kind of a
whole new leg of the story.

461
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:38,330
Hello? Hello. Hi Molly. Can you
hear me? Yes, I can hear you. Woo.

462
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:40,820
I hear some other things
too. Oh, what'd you, yeah.

463
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:43,340
Actually it might just
be static on the line,

464
00:28:43,341 --> 00:28:46,250
but it kind of sounded like the
ocean. I'd just switch up the fan.

465
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,260
Just give me a second.

466
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:51,480
A producer, Molly Webster was able
to track down a reporter in India,

467
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:55,410
Nilanjan a BOMAC and she asked her
if she could find those surrogates.

468
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,800
Okay, so you had given me a
name, right? Lotus, Lotus.

469
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:01,170
Lotus has got a prison that in Nepal.

470
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:06,710
I actually call that person in Nepal and
they did tell me in the location of the

471
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:10,200
clinic part, I spoke to the
doctor and she said that yes,

472
00:29:10,201 --> 00:29:12,420
I will put you in touch
with one of the surrogates.

473
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,200
And the next morning they were supposed
to touch base again, but then you know,

474
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:18,150
she just totally went in, communicated.

475
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:22,290
That's been the same day I opened my
mail and there was a mail from Israel.

476
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:26,280
You know them asking me like, just
like to stop the search for some time.

477
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,540
[inaudible] so

478
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,680
near them as far as we understand what
happened was that the doctor contacted

479
00:29:32,681 --> 00:29:36,940
Lotus, Lotus contacted Talan Amir
saying call off the reporters,

480
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,710
you're putting these
women's lives in danger.

481
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,110
If someone in their village
sees a reporter hanging,

482
00:29:41,770 --> 00:29:43,390
they'll know those women were surrogates.

483
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:48,300
That's not something these circuits
want people to know. Stop. Here's a,

484
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,280
here's my understanding and you
guys correct me if I'm wrong,

485
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:55,260
is say we had asked someone to look for
them and that person got kind of close

486
00:29:55,261 --> 00:30:00,261
and then word got back to the agency and
that's created some pressure for us to

487
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,470
change and you know that's really what
we're sort of staring at right now is how

488
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,160
to respond.

489
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:09,990
We heard that there is a real threat on
their alive because of the culture of

490
00:30:09,991 --> 00:30:14,590
the society that they live in. One of
them was Muslim. I don't know if a, if,

491
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:19,650
if the Muslim society is going to accept
the fact that she carried the pregnancy

492
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:25,020
to a gay couple and two
squarely and to Israelis.

493
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,310
Yeah. So that's a very, very weird,

494
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,490
very delicate situation. Yeah. Firstly,

495
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:37,050
we don't want anything that may hurt, Eh,

496
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,170
the surrogate. Well, I mean,
we want to tell this story.

497
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,850
We definitely don't
want anyone to get hurt,

498
00:30:41,851 --> 00:30:45,690
but I do feel like we have an ethical
obligation to hear from the women who do

499
00:30:45,691 --> 00:30:48,700
this, if not the specific
women in this case,

500
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,510
than people who represent their
experience to whatever degree it can be

501
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,040
represented, it would be,

502
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,280
it would feel wrong for that to be a
voice that we don't hear. I don't know.

503
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:59,480
It's like, Eh,

504
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:01,320
it's for us, it's

505
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,720
a, yeah.

506
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,710
We don't want that.

507
00:31:03,711 --> 00:31:07,700
Anybody will contact our surrogate and
if it says that it's not going to be a

508
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:11,630
without the story, so let's be it
because it's not worth it for us. Okay.

509
00:31:11,631 --> 00:31:15,500
Understood. Understood. We won't make any
further attempts to contact those two,

510
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:19,610
those two, uh, women. Yeah.
Yeah. Just so we're all clear.

511
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:24,320
I think what I'd like to do is to
continue to pursue people who have been in

512
00:31:24,321 --> 00:31:28,520
similar situations but are not in any way
connected to those two women or do you

513
00:31:28,521 --> 00:31:29,354
guys,

514
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:34,030
yeah. Okay. I mean

515
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,060
again, we need to wear only make sure that

516
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,740
eh,

517
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:43,000
nobody's going to be hurt.
Absolutely. Absolutely.

518
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:44,923
Okay.

519
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:48,480
That's where we left things
with telling Amir and then, uh,

520
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,720
and then the story changed a lot.

521
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,483
It's coming up.

522
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:06,560
Hi Radiolab. This is Sally

526
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:24,830
from WM YC studios comes the untold
story of one of the most aspirational

527
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:28,510
and delusional teams in sports history.

528
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,080
We knew that we can beat
anybody in the world.

529
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,440
I'm doing everything I should be
doing and it's still not working.

530
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,770
So what do you guys, you guys can

531
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:39,980
play about it. You guys are the
ones that fricking caused this whole

532
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,660
American fiasco.

533
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:46,880
One team's insane journey to
the 1998 World Cup hosted by me.

534
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:51,200
Roger Bennett had men in Blazers
available wherever you get your podcasts,

535
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,470
a bad world cuff is better than
their workup. You Bet your ass.

536
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,670
Okay. I'm Jen Abu Rod. I'm Robert
Krulwich and Molly Webster.

537
00:33:03,790 --> 00:33:06,950
This is radio lab and we will return
now to our collaboration with Israel.

538
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:10,940
Story producer is Maya
Kosovar and you. Hi, my tau a,

539
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,710
the story of telomere and their three
babies. Now, that's how it started for us.

540
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:16,570
It was a story of two guys
trying to have some kids,

541
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:20,950
but around the point of the earthquake,
uh, the story really shifted for us.

542
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,770
I mean, as it did for
the entire world really,

543
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:25,420
because we've been concentrating
the tale so far on the father's,

544
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:28,270
but with 24 some odd babies.

545
00:33:28,271 --> 00:33:30,880
That's an awful lot of women
who had to carry those babies.

546
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:34,120
So what could they be thinking?
What is the story about them?

547
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:38,740
How are they feeling about
this transaction? Uh, how
much are they getting it?

548
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,410
Will it actually change their life?
These are some of the questions we had.

549
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:44,460
We gave those questions to Molly and
she sort of ran with it. Yeah. Yeah.

550
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:47,680
So in the months after the
earthquake, I guess you could say the,

551
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,290
like the political situation in Nepal

552
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,650
changed how everyone started looking
at surrogacy changed once everyone saw

553
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:58,640
these pictures of all these babies
outside the Israeli embassy being put on

554
00:33:58,641 --> 00:34:02,330
airplanes and sent back to Israel, it
just cracked open this huge debate,

555
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,790
not just back in Israel,
but in Nepal and India.

556
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:08,840
Even internationally basically you
had groups coming out and saying like,

557
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:09,171
you know,

558
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:12,320
the feminists were saying
this is exploitation and
we're just using these women

559
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:13,071
for their wombs.

560
00:34:13,071 --> 00:34:17,000
And there are op ed articles about should
we be shifting women across borders?

561
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:18,860
Is this the way you want to do surrogacy?

562
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:22,920
And then sort of the next
thing that happens, uh,

563
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:25,790
like three weeks after
we talked to talent Amir,

564
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:30,520
is that Nepal actually decided
to ban surrogacy completely,

565
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:34,900
completely for both straits, for both
same sex couples, foreign couples,

566
00:34:34,901 --> 00:34:38,290
local couples, and for, for
Nepali, women couldn't do it.

567
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,740
An Indian woman couldn't come into their
borders and do it. No more surrogacy,

568
00:34:41,741 --> 00:34:44,230
no more loopholes. No more
surrogacy, normal loopholes.

569
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:48,280
But then the confusion was
that they banned surrogacy,

570
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,700
but there was still a pregnant
surrogates on the ground.

571
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:56,540
And so they sort of existed
in this gray zone. Um,

572
00:34:56,590 --> 00:35:00,070
and in the midst of that was when we
went out to try and find surrogates

573
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,680
in Nepal. All the surrogates are kept
in what are called shelter houses,

574
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:08,990
which are just like houses that, um,

575
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:13,510
agencies rent out that have a lot of
pregnant women. We still have these, yes,

576
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,450
they still have the houses,

577
00:35:14,451 --> 00:35:18,410
like the rumors are that they move the
houses further away from the city center,

578
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,270
like attract less attention.

579
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,570
And so we found a Nepali reporter DJ
and I am a freelance journalist based in

580
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:32,870
Kathmandu to go try and get into
one of these shelter houses. So

581
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,040
the shelter house is actually quite
far from the main city centers. Almost

582
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:42,270
half an hour, 40 minutes drive
from Kathmandu. It's on a,

583
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:46,170
on a hilltop because these
are the outskirts of Katmandu
where new settlements

584
00:35:46,171 --> 00:35:48,340
have just started. Uh,

585
00:35:48,350 --> 00:35:52,500
so it was actually a school building,

586
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:57,480
which they turned into a shelter because
I think the school had left after the

587
00:35:57,481 --> 00:35:58,314
earthquake.

588
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:06,300
The moment I reached the first floor,
I was so surprised. It was very noisy.

589
00:36:06,301 --> 00:36:11,000
A lot of children playing around and
turns out a lot of women bringing their

590
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:14,130
young children if they're too young
to be left alone. Really? Yeah.

591
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:18,120
And how many women were there? They were
around I think 20 or 22 women there.

592
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:20,970
20 or 22 women on the first
floor of this building. Yeah.

593
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:26,300
This shelter house was run by
another Israeli agency, so not Lotus,

594
00:36:26,301 --> 00:36:28,100
but a different one. And uh,

595
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:32,270
we're guessing that most of the women
were carrying babies for Israeli couples

596
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,860
and at least the women I saw who outside
the room or who had the doors open.

597
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:41,690
They seem to be around 30 to early
forties. Really? Yeah. I mean,

598
00:36:41,691 --> 00:36:46,150
the first time I saw, I saw the first
woman I talked to kidney's Algeo in May.

599
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:51,170
She was wearing like a mustard
color. Sadie. She had some bangles.

600
00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:53,510
All the women had some
bangles in their hands and

601
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,030
man [inaudible] she said
she was 36 years old.

602
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:04,760
[inaudible] from Kolkata.
[inaudible] she has two girls.

603
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,580
[inaudible] asked, how old are your girls?

604
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:13,910
And she said eight and 12 though
is how'd they do that? The N***A

605
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:18,140
[inaudible] number cutie asked like, why
are you doing this? And the woman said,

606
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,100
[inaudible] Oh, I'm doing it
for them. It's because you know,

607
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,520
we have a lot of financial problem.

608
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:30,320
My husband is a rickshaw driver and
we don't make enough and got him

609
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:35,000
[inaudible] she worked as a maid in Delhi

610
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,880
and ultimately she said she had no other
way to raise money for her daughters to

611
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:40,900
get married because

612
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,130
[inaudible] in Hindu weddings,

613
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,970
the bride's family pays off the
groom in the form of a dowry.

614
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,330
And the plan was to use the money from
surrogacy for the down room diets out of

615
00:37:52,690 --> 00:37:55,450
mind. She'd been in
Katmandu for three months.

616
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,380
So she was in her first trimester
of a named and when per asked her

617
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,290
scaly [inaudible] Scowl Guy [inaudible]

618
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,130
does she know who the baby is for

619
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:12,660
[inaudible] she said no, the
settleable but she knows it's not hers.

620
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,500
Yeah, but that's what's top.

621
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:19,880
And actually all the women that
per QT talked to were very,

622
00:38:19,881 --> 00:38:23,300
very clear about this. She's
at a middle one, not amendment.

623
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,210
This is a job we will eliminate
who I with the may have a Tiko.

624
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,730
The second woman I talked to, 30
years old, also a made in Delhi,

625
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,070
also two daughters. She
looked all dressed up.

626
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,130
She was already too as if she was about

627
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,680
to leave somewhere. And then I
realized, okay, her husband is here.

628
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:42,660
She had just given birth and she put
the job sentiment pretty plainly.

629
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:47,950
[inaudible] so she said, and I'm
translating here, may it by selling

630
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,470
[inaudible] I will give gladly, I will
give the baby from my wound. Yeah, but

631
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,410
[inaudible] if I will think this
is my baby, then how will it work?

632
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,470
I have two children. I
cannot take this child home.

633
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,870
[inaudible] I will have to give.
I have no sadness, no problem.

634
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,590
Anytime for QT asked these
women, are you conflicted?

635
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:14,830
Will you have trouble giving the baby
up? She always got the same answer.

636
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:17,680
Name Nay, nay, nay. Oh,

637
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:20,060
they always say that we would
happily give away the child and

638
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:26,110
[inaudible] if the baby comes out
right now I'll just give a trailer.

639
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:33,070
Did you get a sense that these women
didn't want it known that they were doing

640
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,050
this? Um,

641
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:38,920
I mean some of them did and some of
them didn't because some women were like

642
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,210
[inaudible]. They said like, now that
I'm here, my neighbors, my family,

643
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,780
everyone knows. Oh. And then
when recruitee asked her

644
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:53,990
[inaudible] do they have an opinion? Is
it right or wrong? She answered no, no.

645
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,280
[inaudible] I'm here for the money.
So I would not listen to any opinions.

646
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,350
If it was wrong, I would not come here.

647
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,620
But some of them were like [inaudible]
why would I tell anyone? You know,

648
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:11,990
there was one particular woman
[inaudible] 32 years old,

649
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,890
[inaudible] nail Polish on and
she had laid his pink lipstick on

650
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,860
[inaudible] she said, keep on my village,
simply do not believe these things.

651
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:23,240
We go nanny [inaudible]
and anyone's Oneida.

652
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:26,240
That one can have children by
getting injected or taking medicine.

653
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,550
[inaudible] they won't believe this.

654
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:33,200
She kind of do battles with how some
of the people in our village had done

655
00:40:33,201 --> 00:40:36,350
something similar when
they bred cows or fishes.

656
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:40,970
[inaudible] you said like maybe they'll
understand but my family would not

657
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:44,420
understand name. She
says who'd want to go?

658
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,340
I have told lies to them.

659
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:49,050
[inaudible]

660
00:40:49,050 --> 00:40:51,300
so how much in the end do they make?

661
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:54,930
I asked him [inaudible] how
much money do you get here?

662
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:58,050
I talked to four women and
the figure was the same.

663
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,163
Try to think

664
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,503
[inaudible]

665
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,340
Saturday the 3.5 lacks.

666
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,030
What does that mean in dollars?
So if you do the conversion, um,

667
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:14,490
today it's a 5,000, 300 US dollars.

668
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:18,210
And the way it works is that they get
paid a small amount of money every month

669
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,170
that they're pregnant.

670
00:41:19,171 --> 00:41:23,550
And then at the end they get a lump sum
for Cudi says that for these women at

671
00:41:23,551 --> 00:41:25,320
the end of the pregnancy, that lump sum,

672
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:28,150
it is like let's say around two or $3,000,

673
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,150
which is the amount that talent
Amir heard outside the embassy.

674
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:34,040
The total sum that they have
when they go back home is quite,

675
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:38,870
you know, it's not a lot. So five ish
thousand dollars is what you're hearing.

676
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,310
Yeah. Wow.

677
00:41:40,311 --> 00:41:43,970
That's a difference to sort of see if
this was a number that was just coming out

678
00:41:43,971 --> 00:41:48,680
of that shelter house or if it was
something that was like the going rate,

679
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:53,270
I guess. Uh, we talked to six
surrogates who are in India,

680
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,130
that same rate,

681
00:41:55,131 --> 00:41:59,450
around $5,000 kept coming up and we did
hear a range from one surrogate. Um,

682
00:41:59,451 --> 00:42:03,350
and this was about a friend of hers.
Uh, we heard as low as a thousand.

683
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,680
It's a surrogate getting only a
thousand dollars for a pregnancy. Yeah.

684
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,413
Yeah.

685
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,530
Hello? Hello.

686
00:42:17,750 --> 00:42:21,530
This is Jerusalem calling
New York. Answering.

687
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:25,400
Ultimately we took this information
back to Tom and mere because this was

688
00:42:25,401 --> 00:42:29,690
originally their question. So let's
talk about the money part now.

689
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,660
All right, so the last
time we talked to you,

690
00:42:32,930 --> 00:42:37,070
you thought you were paying
your surrogates $12,000 yes,

691
00:42:37,370 --> 00:42:38,570
around ish.

692
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:42,770
We've been off reporting and it seems
like the number that's coming up most

693
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:47,771
consistently for what surrogates are
reporting as their rate is 5,300 US

694
00:42:48,771 --> 00:42:49,604
dollars.

695
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,673
What?

696
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,970
Yeah, I don't if it's fast. Too much.

697
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:59,520
Whoa, whoa.

698
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,590
It's too low. It's too low.

699
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:10,250
Really? Yeah. I want to cry.

700
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:15,440
We explained to them that if you
actually look at the contract,

701
00:43:15,441 --> 00:43:19,400
the line that looks like it's to payment
straight to the surrogate doesn't

702
00:43:19,401 --> 00:43:21,470
actually say this is
painted for the surrogate.

703
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,680
It says this is payment to
surrogacy services and it's
sort of like once you add

704
00:43:27,411 --> 00:43:31,160
in that second word, it opens
the door to all kinds of things.

705
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,490
She's getting less

706
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:33,483
then the half.

707
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:38,000
It's very, it's like we feel like suckers.

708
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:42,790
It's a cool get the money.
So who got the money?

709
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:48,770
The question. It hung in the
air for a few weeks until

710
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,340
I have a around seven minutes before I
go into something that I did see my car

711
00:43:53,341 --> 00:43:54,070
now

712
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:57,760
I was finally able to talk to Don and
Muck Dossey who is the head of Lotus,

713
00:43:57,761 --> 00:44:00,460
which is the agency that
talent Amir used in Nepal.

714
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:02,950
She had just in the
morning I talked to her,

715
00:44:02,951 --> 00:44:07,300
she had just flown in from Nepal to Israel
and I caught her in a car on her way

716
00:44:07,301 --> 00:44:10,540
back to the airport and she was going
to fly off to Australia and I asked her

717
00:44:10,541 --> 00:44:12,370
how much do the surrogates
actually get paid.

718
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:17,540
I can tell you truly that I worked in
Indiana college since 2010 and I cannot

719
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:24,260
tell you exactly how much the Jerry
eight holding your hand at the end of the

720
00:44:24,721 --> 00:44:29,400
procedure because we don't transfer
the funds to the surrogate herself.

721
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:34,580
She's saying she has no idea and the
she has no idea is because she said this

722
00:44:35,221 --> 00:44:38,190
and other agencies I spoke to said
this is that when you're working on the

723
00:44:38,191 --> 00:44:41,940
ground in foreign countries
under the umbrella of surrogacy,

724
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:46,770
you are dealing with a lot of middlemen
and the middlemen have middlemen and

725
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:47,840
there are sub middle men.

726
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,840
The people who find the women in
India who get all the paperwork done,

727
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:53,970
who get them to the border,
who get them over the border,

728
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,380
who then bring them to some Paul,

729
00:44:55,620 --> 00:44:58,440
someone meets them in Katmandu gets
them to the shelter house and all those

730
00:44:58,441 --> 00:45:00,570
people may need to get paid.

731
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:05,280
I truly can't tell you that. I
truly don't know. After the agents,

732
00:45:05,281 --> 00:45:08,150
you know how much the surrogates,
they have three to hands.

733
00:45:08,190 --> 00:45:13,190
We don't come and ask the agent exactly
how much goes for her compensation.

734
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:17,520
Exactly how much goes for her and
nowadays we don't go into that.

735
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:18,730
I can tell you that.

736
00:45:18,730 --> 00:45:20,350
Well, I guess I was thinking about,

737
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,700
I would feel conflicted as the
head of an agency to be like,

738
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:28,990
I think the money's going to some
people, but I just don't know.

739
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:31,770
Like I think that would niggle at me.

740
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,570
Yeah, well that's a good thing
that you're doing what you do.

741
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:36,493
You and I'm dealing with that.

742
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:37,543
Yes.

743
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,670
And you know, you can look
the whole world and say, okay,

744
00:45:43,671 --> 00:45:45,620
I'm going to make it a brighter,

745
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,650
I cannot deal with all
the problems in the world.

746
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,110
We are trying to give
him as much as possible.

747
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:58,400
We paid the money for
this woman gets life and,

748
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:05,850
and now we understand it's
not exactly like that.

749
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,560
It's not right.

750
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,580
I mean that's the real, I think
the deep question here underneath,

751
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,780
after everything is over is when,

752
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,720
when we do a generous thing,

753
00:46:17,721 --> 00:46:20,660
like we give people families who
couldn't have families before,

754
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:23,270
but that becomes a business.

755
00:46:23,810 --> 00:46:28,810
Is there something about the business of
making a family that is always going to

756
00:46:31,461 --> 00:46:36,461
be a little troubling and there are no
perfect ways to do this or is there a way

757
00:46:37,401 --> 00:46:41,120
to pull this off in
some, I just don't know.

758
00:46:42,110 --> 00:46:42,943
I mean like

759
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:49,540
I still have three more embryos that
they're in the freezer in Japan.

760
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:56,000
I don't know if the next time I would
not do the process may be in the state.

761
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:03,200
The U S is like an entirely
different surrogacy scene,

762
00:47:03,201 --> 00:47:06,710
which we're just not going to get into
here. But the interesting thing that, uh,

763
00:47:06,711 --> 00:47:08,720
that uh, Donna said and and,

764
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,190
and ahead of another agency was that they
think that in the next like five to 10

765
00:47:13,191 --> 00:47:13,491
years,

766
00:47:13,491 --> 00:47:16,720
the US will be one of the only countries
where surrogacy is still happening.

767
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:16,910
Right?

768
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:20,310
These things are closing down. Most
of the things are closing down.

769
00:47:20,550 --> 00:47:22,690
So obviously Nepal has a band, Thailand,

770
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:27,160
it looks like a in a few days after this
piece comes out that India may ban it

771
00:47:27,161 --> 00:47:30,700
for foreigners, Cambodia, there's
rumors that they're about to ban it.

772
00:47:30,701 --> 00:47:35,020
And even in Canada, there are talks of
new restrictions on surrogacy and this,

773
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:39,850
these are bands like not just for same
sex couples, but uh, federal couples,

774
00:47:39,851 --> 00:47:43,120
single people, everybody.
Oh. And the main reason

775
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:47,520
all of these bands and restrictions as,
as worries about, uh, exploiting women.

776
00:47:47,710 --> 00:47:52,470
Yeah. I feel weird about that
a little bit though because,

777
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:55,890
cause if your ex, if
you're trying to, if you,

778
00:47:55,891 --> 00:47:59,130
as we heard these women are making a
business decision whether or not we agree

779
00:47:59,131 --> 00:48:00,780
with it as an entirely separate thing,

780
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,730
it seems they seem like
they're making a decision,

781
00:48:02,731 --> 00:48:07,620
then we're going to take it away in order
to protect them. Feels, I don't know.

782
00:48:07,650 --> 00:48:12,150
It's funny because it times, it also
feels it, you just think like, okay,

783
00:48:12,151 --> 00:48:14,660
these women can decide how they're
going to use their own bodies. Right?

784
00:48:14,661 --> 00:48:17,730
It's a little bit like a little black,
the abortion debate in a way. Totally.

785
00:48:18,030 --> 00:48:20,890
Yes. But by the same token, it is,

786
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:24,030
it's not wrong for a society to say, Hey,

787
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:27,030
there are certain things
we just won't allow.

788
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,250
We won't give you that choice because we,

789
00:48:29,730 --> 00:48:33,750
we find that the choice
itself is, um, is wrong.

790
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:35,630
[inaudible] I mean, it's fair,

791
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:38,000
but like one of the arguments
against banning it is that,

792
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:43,300
is that there's still a demand for
surrogacy and that that's not going to go

793
00:48:44,901 --> 00:48:49,820
away. And so it just pushes
this system underground. And so,

794
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:54,590
uh, and, and then that way it's a
lot, you know, shady or, yeah. Um,

795
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:55,580
but the other thing was,

796
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:58,400
is that then Prakruti actually went
and talked to the women about like,

797
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:04,020
[inaudible] what this job does
for them up gazebos. I go to much,

798
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:07,520
I think you owe me like, okay, so
it's not the crazy amount of money.

799
00:49:07,521 --> 00:49:10,520
We thought it might've been. It's
$5,000. Like what does that do for you?

800
00:49:12,310 --> 00:49:15,920
[inaudible] that Asuka one woman
said, you know, when I get this money,

801
00:49:16,130 --> 00:49:18,380
I'm willing to go back home
and start something when my

802
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,940
[inaudible] start a small shop. Do
you know my own little enterprise?

803
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,810
[inaudible] the other women,

804
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,870
all of them wanted to use
this money to build a house.

805
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:36,410
[inaudible] can you buy a plot of
land in New Delhi for five grand?

806
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,260
You definitely could not get a plot
of land in New Delhi for five grand.

807
00:49:39,261 --> 00:49:41,900
But what these women do is they take
the money and they go back to their

808
00:49:41,901 --> 00:49:45,470
original village and they use it
there to buy a small plot of land.

809
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,140
And that's totally doable and
it's actually no small feat.

810
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:51,710
Having that ownership of land is so
important in our societies in South Asia,

811
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,040
once you owned land in South
Asia, it raises your, um,

812
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:56,780
like socioeconomic status.

813
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,120
It's something that's passed
down through generations.

814
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,310
So you're like creating
something for your family.

815
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:04,280
And if you're one of the women
that may be already have land,

816
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,550
the thing you can do with that
$5,000 is build a house on it.

817
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:11,390
It's a very small like mud house or you
know, keep in mind like these women,

818
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:13,280
their day jobs are all made right?

819
00:50:13,281 --> 00:50:16,250
And so they make less than
a hundred dollars a month.

820
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,350
They said had it not
been for this, I mean,

821
00:50:18,351 --> 00:50:23,120
they would have never probably never
owned this much money at at a single

822
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:26,410
chance, but more than that,
like boom, guess what?

823
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,900
You're gonna cost when you go into
this, or at least when I went into this,

824
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,690
the thing that I expected to see
was like, okay, these are poor,

825
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:35,330
desperate women that are being
forced into this. Like right.

826
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:36,860
They'd been dragged across the border.

827
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:40,700
I think the thing that I was surprised
to see when I looked at the transcript

828
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,130
was that I'm cutting,

829
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:47,030
even though these women don't have a
lot of options and yes, they are poor,

830
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:51,650
they had chosen to do this out of
the limited options that they had.

831
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,360
They looked at them all
and they thought like,

832
00:50:53,361 --> 00:50:56,240
this is the thing that I'm
going to do to get what I want.

833
00:50:56,630 --> 00:50:59,300
It felt like these women
were making a choice.

834
00:50:59,420 --> 00:51:03,920
I asked him [inaudible] what if you
were given a challenge to go abroad,

835
00:51:03,921 --> 00:51:07,990
let's say Dubai or Qatar, because a lot
of women from India and [inaudible],

836
00:51:08,210 --> 00:51:13,130
one of them said that, you know,
[inaudible] like why would I do that?

837
00:51:13,131 --> 00:51:16,820
That would be very far away. She
says that here the kids can come,

838
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,100
their husbands can visit.
Oh, they're fed. Well

839
00:51:20,860 --> 00:51:23,660
[inaudible] the surrogates get good
medical care that taken care of during the

840
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:24,920
whole nine months and,

841
00:51:24,970 --> 00:51:29,120
and for this whole nine months they're
sending money back home and back home.

842
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:33,260
There's one less mouth to
feed. I think it'll be, I mean,

843
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:36,320
the way we passed judgment, you
know, you just pity on these women,

844
00:51:36,321 --> 00:51:40,280
but I think they've, they are
very aware of what they're doing.

845
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,340
They might be exploited to
some level like you said,

846
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:47,090
but it seemed like the women in some ways,

847
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:52,010
they are in charge of deciding how they
want their life to be and we don't have

848
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:55,160
to look at them with, um, with PT.

849
00:51:57,830 --> 00:52:02,720
No. [inaudible] the last woman
that Perkuto he spoke to,

850
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:05,660
she was a 32 year old
woman from Darjeeling.

851
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:08,210
She spoken to Polly and she told

852
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:15,110
[inaudible] [inaudible]
[inaudible] I came here in March.

853
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:17,300
My embryo transfer was done once,

854
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:20,150
but I don't know if it was due to
the earthquake or something else,

855
00:52:20,180 --> 00:52:22,460
but it didn't get heartbeat
and it got washed.

856
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,640
She said that she lost the fetus in
two months and he tried it twice on her

857
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,693
[inaudible]

858
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,920
per QT. How did you feel
when the child got washed?

859
00:52:37,870 --> 00:52:42,460
Surrogate one nugget. I felt bad.

860
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:50,010
Oh Kayla, not I did what to say op? No.

861
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:53,430
Afnan I have noticed that Lachsa
it felt like it was my own.

862
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:55,633
Okay.

863
00:52:55,790 --> 00:53:00,790
Buckle Tyna I'm a in queue and they
won't give money if it's unsuccessful.

864
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:06,540
They know they're not gum banana
[inaudible] well we, she, I, I'm like,

865
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:11,460
I didn't know if you miscarry you
don't get paid. Yes, yes, yes.

866
00:53:11,490 --> 00:53:13,710
She says it's treated like a business.

867
00:53:13,800 --> 00:53:18,800
You get paid for every month
you successfully carry and
if you do lose the baby,

868
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:21,420
depending on where it is in the pregnancy,

869
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:24,450
part of the money is refunded
to the intended parents.

870
00:53:29,970 --> 00:53:30,690
[inaudible] surrogates.

871
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:35,010
Most of my friends had successful
stories to share back in Delhi.

872
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:39,660
Some of my friends made a house with the
money. Some bought land. I felt good.

873
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:45,540
[inaudible] [inaudible] she basically
says she wishes she had done this earlier

874
00:53:45,541 --> 00:53:49,080
because now with the band she was
being sent back to her village.

875
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,910
She was still weeping on little of what
could have been if she was, you know,

876
00:53:53,911 --> 00:53:56,810
if the eggs were healthy enough,
if it held those old right one

877
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,120
[inaudible] [inaudible] the money for
Kuti will you come again if this opens

878
00:54:03,121 --> 00:54:04,350
back up and try again?

879
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:08,820
Repeat the own ones up
a 10 oh to surrogate.

880
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:12,060
Yes. I will come.

881
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:27,330
[inaudible] [inaudible]

882
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,163
producer Molly Webster.

883
00:54:52,610 --> 00:54:53,110
[inaudible] [inaudible]

884
00:54:53,110 --> 00:54:56,290
there's something on your face that
says we're not quite done here.

885
00:54:56,291 --> 00:54:58,490
What do you you want to wait?
We're done. We're done. No, no.

886
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,330
It was say which say what's on
your mind. Wow. I'm thinking.

887
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:05,020
I'm thinking about all the different
ways we've thought about the story along

888
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:07,840
the way of making it. I mean
you can read it as like,

889
00:55:07,841 --> 00:55:11,590
this is a story about the
business of family making,

890
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:16,150
the outsourcing of babies. You can
hear it as a story about exploitation.

891
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,520
All these different things are
happening in the story, but yeah,

892
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:23,870
but it occurs to me that this is also a
story about the inventiveness of people

893
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:27,270
in some way, way you mean?
What do you mean by that?

894
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:30,070
I guess what I mean is like
the way that culture is,

895
00:55:30,071 --> 00:55:34,420
we'll cross fertilize in these really
unexpected, like, okay, like this is,

896
00:55:34,470 --> 00:55:35,303
these are two,

897
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:39,220
these are two sets of needs that are sort
of reaching out and finding each other

898
00:55:39,550 --> 00:55:40,450
half a world away.

899
00:55:41,170 --> 00:55:46,170
And there's a kind of symbiotic benefit
even while it's troubling and maybe

900
00:55:46,631 --> 00:55:50,020
unfair, it's still kinda there and like,

901
00:55:50,021 --> 00:55:52,720
so I feel like we could talk about
the story in any number of ways,

902
00:55:52,721 --> 00:55:55,330
but I also feel like one of the things
that happened here is this is a story

903
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:59,890
about dreams and about aspiring
to have a better life. And how,

904
00:55:59,891 --> 00:56:00,461
in this case,

905
00:56:00,461 --> 00:56:05,080
those aspirations meet in this
really uncomfortable transaction.

906
00:56:11,620 --> 00:56:12,453
[inaudible] [inaudible]

907
00:56:13,530 --> 00:56:18,470
yeah, let's thank people I said we
should do next. Let's thank them. Yeah.

908
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,540
So many people. Okay. Okay. Well
first we should, uh, we should,

909
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:26,500
I began thinking, uh, posse it
Israel story in Maya COSERV air.

910
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,790
We have just, we went in deep
with those guys for the story.

911
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:33,340
Check them out. It's really cool stuff.

912
00:56:33,370 --> 00:56:38,260
At prx.org in Israel story.org what was
the one you were just telling us about?

913
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,190
Oh I love this one.

914
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:44,190
There's a story that they did last season
in which they went to every town in

915
00:56:44,261 --> 00:56:45,820
Israel that has a Hertzel street.

916
00:56:46,110 --> 00:56:47,560
Hurtles was like the George
Washington of Israel.

917
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:48,730
So they all have hurtful streets.

918
00:56:48,731 --> 00:56:50,890
They'd knocked on 48 cause
Israel was found in 48.

919
00:56:51,190 --> 00:56:54,220
They go knock knock who's there and
they opened the door in the interview,

920
00:56:54,221 --> 00:56:58,180
whoever's on the other side of the
door. It's just a wonderful, cool idea.

921
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,450
And they get to meet a
crazy quilt of Israelis.

922
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:05,350
Well huge thanks to these road story
team and to Barry Finkle and to our

930
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:33,350
And thanks to Ivan Zimmerman and for
music special thanks to Nos Jeeva,

had production help for this.

932
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:40,930
A story from Andy Mills and this piece
was produced and reported by Molly

933
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:44,650
Webster. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich. I'm Molly Webster.

934
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,280
Thanks for listening. Oh, one last
note. We should tell you that, uh,

935
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:54,330
telomere did meet their
surrogates very briefly one time.

936
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:56,680
And uh, it's kind of a cool moment.

937
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,810
We couldn't figure out where
to put it in this story,

938
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:03,940
but we have that scene on our
website@radiolab.org and it's worthless.
