00:00:08.516 --> 00:00:11.526
&gt;&gt;Social emotional learning
started out as I think,

00:00:11.526 --> 00:00:13.556
a little hobby that some people had.

00:00:13.846 --> 00:00:17.186
It was an idea that we
thought would be a good thing

00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:19.266
to help kids feel better
about themselves

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.246
and maybe prevent some problems.

00:00:21.746 --> 00:00:25.616
But as we started to study the
impact of this, we began to realize

00:00:25.776 --> 00:00:28.416
that this is a very
serious part of education.

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:32.436
That not one single
classroom can function

00:00:32.636 --> 00:00:36.686
without a good inter-personal set
of relationships between the kids,

00:00:36.686 --> 00:00:39.206
with each other and between
the teacher and the kids,

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:40.906
the teacher and the principal.

00:00:40.906 --> 00:00:42.416
The whole thing is inter-personal.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:46.736
So what we thought was sort of
marginal and maybe a little off

00:00:46.776 --> 00:00:51.186
to the side, now we start to
realize, this is the foundation

00:00:51.186 --> 00:00:52.656
of what all learning is about.

00:00:53.136 --> 00:00:54.316
And then we started to reflect

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:56.406
on teachers we've had
when we were younger.

00:00:56.896 --> 00:00:58.426
And we all had teachers
when we were younger.

00:00:58.426 --> 00:01:00.296
Some were good teachers,
some were not so good.

00:01:00.496 --> 00:01:02.186
But you know, we all
remember teachers

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:05.016
who affected us in a profound way.

00:01:05.446 --> 00:01:09.156
And it turns out that what we
learned from those teachers,

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.176
has stayed with us
longer than anything else,

00:01:12.716 --> 00:01:15.686
even when we've taken the
standardized tests and passed tests

00:01:15.686 --> 00:01:20.536
and I took the Regents in New
York and you do all that stuff.

00:01:21.276 --> 00:01:24.696
The only thing that matters is
whether there was a caring context

00:01:24.996 --> 00:01:27.866
for what you learned,
because that stays with you.

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.986
My own view is that we're
starting to realize,

00:01:32.106 --> 00:01:38.026
social and emotional development
is an absolutely essential part

00:01:38.026 --> 00:01:40.956
of academic success
and success in life.

00:01:42.116 --> 00:01:45.006
Unapologetically, we have
to make an integral part

00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.406
of everything that
happens in schools.

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:51.686
When that happens, I think
we're gonna have schools

00:01:51.686 --> 00:01:56.806
that are more productive and I think
we're gonna even transform kids

00:01:57.836 --> 00:02:02.846
to be the kinds of kids that I
think we talk about when we say,

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.906
"Oh we want our kids to
become better citizens.

00:02:05.236 --> 00:02:07.186
We want our kids to be more caring."

00:02:07.916 --> 00:02:11.446
We need to give them opportunities
to do that in the schools.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:14.466
And then they will actually turn
around and do that in their lives.

00:02:16.056 --> 00:02:20.266
So I am very excited about
where we're at right now,

00:02:20.986 --> 00:02:22.346
but we're at a crossroads.

00:02:23.336 --> 00:02:26.636
The crossroads is that
it's not something

00:02:26.636 --> 00:02:28.076
that only happens in classrooms.

00:02:29.316 --> 00:02:31.566
It's not something that
only happens in programs.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:36.786
It's something that has to be a basic
part of the way every single educator

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:39.226
that steps into the
building sees their job.

00:02:41.186 --> 00:02:46.566
Teachers, principals, psychologists,
social workers, counselors,

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:52.416
every school staff member, if you
ask them, "What are you doing here?"

00:02:52.416 --> 00:02:55.986
Their first answer should be,
"I'm here to promote the social

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.076
and emotional and academic
development of children.

00:02:58.756 --> 00:02:59.446
That's my job.

00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:00.816
That's what I'm here for."

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.476
And we're going to do this
in a collaborative way

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:06.106
and that's how we have a
chance to be successful.

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:10.226
But we're not there yet and that's
the big challenge that I see.

00:03:11.646 --> 00:03:13.096
I'm involved in a project

00:03:13.096 --> 00:03:15.656
in New Jersey called developing
safe and civil schools.

00:03:16.516 --> 00:03:19.226
And the State Department
of Education of New Jersey,

00:03:19.676 --> 00:03:23.756
has mandated our project to try to
bring social and emotional learning

00:03:23.946 --> 00:03:27.066
to all 2400 New Jersey schools.

00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:32.256
And we have over 600 districts
and we're gonna do this.

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:34.586
And the reason we're gonna do it,

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:36.556
is because we don't have
to start from scratch.

00:03:36.776 --> 00:03:38.656
It's already there.

00:03:39.286 --> 00:03:42.376
You talk to teachers and you ask
them why they came into this field

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:45.856
and they'll tell you, we
wanted to affect children

00:03:45.856 --> 00:03:47.366
and make them into better people.

00:03:48.366 --> 00:03:50.646
We just have to provide
the opportunities.

00:03:51.036 --> 00:03:55.246
And I think we'll find that when
we build from the bottom up,

00:03:55.246 --> 00:04:01.076
when we take what's already in place,
tweak it, nurture it and most of all,

00:04:01.406 --> 00:04:04.196
interconnect it, we are
gonna be successful.

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:07.896
The analogy that I like
to use is that of a quilt.

00:04:09.046 --> 00:04:12.516
There are many programs in place
that we're giving our children

00:04:12.516 --> 00:04:13.946
and I see them as pieces of a quilt.

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:18.306
They're all beautiful individually
but they don't make anybody warm

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:20.206
until you stitch them together.

00:04:20.906 --> 00:04:23.016
Two pieces, three pieces,
four pieces,

00:04:23.016 --> 00:04:25.726
stitched together coherently,
cohesively.

00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:29.386
And we don't know, nobody
knows really how many pieces

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:31.066
of a quilt it takes
to make a child warm.

00:04:31.886 --> 00:04:36.166
But I do know that it doesn't
take covering the absolute,

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:37.506
entire body of the child.

00:04:38.566 --> 00:04:40.856
We just have to keep
stitching those pieces together

00:04:41.596 --> 00:04:43.856
and we are gonna find
ourselves being successful.

00:04:43.856 --> 00:04:44.786
We're going to reach
the tipping point.

00:04:45.656 --> 00:04:49.236
And our kids and our schools
are going to find that they are

00:04:49.236 --> 00:04:52.006
in the business of promoting social,
emotional and academic learning

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:56.456
as a totality, as a
unity and not in pieces.

00:04:57.036 --> 00:04:58.106
And I think we can do this.

00:04:58.216 --> 00:05:00.736
And I'm very optimistic about this.

00:05:02.116 --> 00:05:05.656
This is a field that is as
well supported by research

00:05:06.216 --> 00:05:08.526
as any other endeavor in education.

00:05:09.206 --> 00:05:12.876
It's as well supported by
research as most of what we know

00:05:12.876 --> 00:05:15.356
about psychotherapy and
other kinds of interventions.

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:21.106
We are talking about a field
that makes sense in our hearts.

00:05:21.106 --> 00:05:22.716
It makes sense in our minds.

00:05:22.716 --> 00:05:26.556
It makes sense in our
data and we can do it.

00:05:26.866 --> 00:05:30.716
So I think this is something that
really can join us all together,

00:05:30.906 --> 00:05:36.076
across disciplines and not
just leave no child behind,

00:05:36.076 --> 00:05:41.356
but dedicate ourselves to moving
every child forward as far

00:05:41.356 --> 00:05:42.536
as their potential can take them.

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:44.446
That's an exciting
and fun thing to do.
