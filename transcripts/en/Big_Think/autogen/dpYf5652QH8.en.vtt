00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.450
In the past, we had what you might call a
temporal model of learning.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.280
First you'd learn, then you'd work.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.060
But in the current era, working and learning
will have to be much better integrated.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.350
They will have to be connected.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:26.510
If you think about the transition to the industrial
age a generation ago, people who went from

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:32.430
farm jobs to factory jobs, actually that transition
was not that difficult.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.430
It was essentially a different way of using
manual skills in order to be able to do the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.660
work that's required in that new age, in the
industrial age.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.840
In the transition from the industrial age
to the knowledge age, we have a very different

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.450
set of circumstances.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.680
So, for example, the people who were recently
laid off by GM are not going to easily transition

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.670
into coding jobs.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.370
It's a very different set of skills and abilities
that they will need to be trained in, that

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.640
they'll need to be educated in, in order to
be able to do these new jobs, to do the "human

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.300
work" that's required.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.780
So there's a growing understanding that human
work, the work that only humans can do, does

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.240
not need to take place in a job.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.240
It can take place in a context where you have
an interaction with someone who provides the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.550
resources, the money for you to pay for what
needs to be done, but is not in the context

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.550
of a job.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.870
And I think we're going to start to see that
in terms of how the learning system connects

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.720
with how we're preparing people for jobs.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.020
In other words we don't need to be preparing
them for "jobs" in that sense.

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.500
We need to be preparing them for the human
work, and we need to be thinking about people

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.930
not as students or as workers but as worker-learners
over the course of their entire lifetime.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.460
Now, in this context, I think it's important
for us to remember that as we prepare people

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.710
for that future of work we actually have to
make sure that they have both generalizable

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.530
knowledge and skills as well as content specific
knowledge.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:13.760
In other words, you're not going to be preparing
for a job in accounting or chemistry or graphic

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760
design.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.209
You're going to be preparing for a broader
set of knowledge skills and abilities that

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.950
you can apply in different work contexts.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.499
Some of that might be in the context of what
we today traditionally call a job, but going

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:31.209
forward I think people are going to be working
in lots of different ways, in ad hoc ways,

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.680
as independent contractors, et cetera.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.150
That's the kind of work we need to be preparing
people for.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.730
Lumina's vision for this is that we actually
have need to have a system where we match

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:49.159
the credentials that people attain with what
they will actually need in this future workplace.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:54.510
We need to make sure that the credentials
are transparent, that they actually show what

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.719
people know and can do.

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:02.029
That the learning providers are actually preparing
people to get those credentials â€“ whether

00:03:02.029 --> 00:03:09.510
they be degrees, certificates, certifications,
badges, licenses, whatever it may be, in ways

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.410
that are transparent, that actually do help
both the individual and the person employing

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.180
them or the company employing them understand
what they know and can do.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.079
And those transparent credentials actually
have to be applied in a way that aggregates

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.590
so that society benefits from those credentials.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.939
In other words, you as an individual need
to get a credential that is important to you,

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:42.700
but ultimately we need to have our eyes on
the prize, which is the combination of all

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.529
of those people with those credentials.

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:49.930
That talent is what's going to power our economy,
strengthen our democratic systems, ultimately

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:56.680
improve our well being, because of that talent
that's being developed and acknowledged through

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.419
the credentials.
