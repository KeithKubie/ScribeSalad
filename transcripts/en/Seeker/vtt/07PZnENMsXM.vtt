00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.410
AS THE SAYING GOES...LIES, DAMNED LIES AND
TWITTER...BUT SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING TO CHANGE

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.400
THAT WITH AN ONLINE LIE DETECTOR.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:13.500
[MUSIC]

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.059
HEY THIS IS ANNIE FOR DNEWS.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.279
DURING MAJOR EVENTS LIKE THE CURRENT UPRISING
IN UKRAINE, THE ARAB SPRING, NATURAL DISASTERS

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.230
OR EVEN THE OLYMPICS...SOCIAL MEDIA IS INVALUABLE
IN GETTING INFORMATION OUT TO THE PUBLIC.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.199
BUT JUST AS EASILY, REAL-TIME SOURCES LIKE
TWITTER CAN BE A LIE FACTORY. TAKE THE ACCOUNT

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.960
@SOCHIPROBLEMS, WHICH COLLECTED JOURNALIST
COMPLAINTS ABOUT BIZARRE BATHROOMS, HOTELS

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.360
AND GENERAL WEIRDNESS AT THE OLYMPICS...MUCH
OF IT HILARIOUS. THE PROBLEM? A LOT OF THE

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
PHOTOS WEREN'T REAL - OR AT LEAST, THEY WEREN'T
ACTUALLY FROM SOCHI. IN SOME CASES THE PHOTOS

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.870
PEOPLE PASSED AROUND ON SOCHI PROBLEMS WAS
TOTALLY UNRELATED STUFF FROM REDDIT.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.560
TWITTER LIES CAN HAVE MORE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
TOO, LIKE IN 2011 DURING THE LONDON RIOTS.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.910
TWEETS FALSELY REPORTED THAT ANIMALS WERE
LOOSE FROM THE ZOO AND THAT LANDMARKS WERE

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.230
ON FIRE. PANIC ENSUED, POLICE WERE DIVERTED,
AND IT WAS BAD.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.370
DURING HURRICANE SANDY, AN ACCOUNT CALLED
COMFORTABLY SMUG TWEETED OUT A SERIES OF LIES,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.230
INCLUDING THAT THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE
WAS FLOODED WHICH WAS RETWEETED HUNDREDS OF

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.720
TIMES.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.190
IN 2013, THE AP TWITTER ACCOUNT WAS HACKED
BY THE SYRIAN ELECTRONIC ARMY, WHO POSTED

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.500
THAT BARACK OBAMA WAS INJURED IN AN EXPLOSION.
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS CORRECTED PRETTY QUICKLY,

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.850
THE TWEET CAUSED THE DOW JONES TO DROP 143
POINTS.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
WHY ARE PEOPLE SO QUICK TO BELIEVE THESE LIES?
THAT'S A BIG QUESTION, BUT ACCORDING TO ONE

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.420
RECENT STUDY IT BOILS DOWN TO THIS - INTERPRETING
THINGS CRITICALLY IS JUST HARDER ON YOUR BRAIN

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.790
THAN BELIEVING IT AT FACE VALUE. OR IN SOME
CASES HITTING THAT RETWEET BUTTON. IT'S KINDA

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:27.770
HUMAN NATURE.

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.250
SO HOW DO WE SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF MISINFORMATION?
WELL, SOME HAVE SUGGESTED THAT IT SHOULD ACTUALLY

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.530
BE A CRIMINAL OFFENSE TO MAKE STUFF UP ON
TWITTER.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.430
BUT EUROPEAN SCIENTISTS HAVE A DIFFERENT ANSWER
- WITH FUNDING FROM THE EU, THEY'RE BUILDING

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.210
AN ONLINE LIE DETECTOR THAT THEY SAY CAN FILTER
OUT MISINFORMATION IN REAL TIME.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.479
CALLED FAY-MAY -AFTER THE GREEK REPRESENTATION
OF MALICIOUS GOSSIP - THE SYSTEM IS STILL

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.520
IN DEVELOPMENT, BUT THE RESEARCHERS HINTED
AT SOME WAYS TO TELL IF THAT RETWEET YOU KEEP

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.060
SEEING IS A LIE. BOTS FOR EXAMPLE ARE A FACTOR
- OR GHOST ACCOUNTS THAT DON'T HAVE MUCH ACTIVITY

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.710
ON THEM.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.670
AND THE KEY IS ALSO IDENTIFYING THE TYPE OF
LIE - WHETHER IT'S MALICIOUS, OR BASED ON

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.229
SPECULATION OR CONTROVERSY, CONNECTING THE
TWEET BACK TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCES TO ASSESS

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.280
WHETHER IT'S ACCURATE.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.950
SO IF WE CAN'T RELY ON HUMAN JUDGMENT TO SUSS
OUT FACT FROM FICTION ONLINE, THE EU IS BETTING

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.230
THAT COMPUTERS CAN. THE FAY-MAY SYSTEM WILL
BE TESTED BY THE Swiss Broadcasting Corporation

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.909
AND Institute of Psychiatry at King's College
London.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.279
DO YOU THINK THIS WILL WORK? SHOULD IT BE
A CRIME TO TELL LIES ON TWITTER? LET US KNOW
