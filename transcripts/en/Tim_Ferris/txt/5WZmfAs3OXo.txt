Speaker 1:          00:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:05          hey you people, I'm Tim asked me to make a quick video of our home gym. Now there's a couple things about the home gym that's crucial. If you are a busy working person, this is driving me crazy. If you're a busy working person, you absolutely have to have a home gym. At the very least a Kettlebell and a jump rope. You got to be able to train on your own. And if you own a Shim, you definitely have to have a gym on those. You're never going to train ever again. So this is our home gym J. Stars on the camera up my number one trading partner of all time. You'll see that there's a lot of bikes in here. Um, we have a walk bike, which we love lots of kettlebells. Um, we believe in the aerobic base. This is probably largely in part to a Brian Mckinsey's influence, um, from an urge to an assault bike to the, uh, to the concept to stand up skier, um, our bikes up there.

Speaker 1:          00:51          Then we have a few kind of miscellaneous mobilization pieces in here and then skateboards and bikes. Anyway, but this is where some of the other work happens. Call the things that are on our house. Um, Juliette has all of her girlfriends come over a couple times a week. How many times we j three times a week, four times a week, four times a week. They train here. We have the Cherryland to barbell club for men. So I bring all the boys over. We squat heavy. Then we had this thing called kids squat club and a once a week we're being all the kids over. And this is predicated on an idea that, uh, that our friend Matt Vincent put out, they said, hey, you know, someone's in interviewing him, they were like, how do you get strong? And he's like, well, just squat heavy once a week for 10 years.

Speaker 1:          01:25          Tell me what happened. So we started out with them once. Your kids, so we do a little squatting. Um, so we have the rogue rig here, which is nice tire flipping my current favorite things. Donny Thompson's fat bells. This is my, uh, it's really made a difference on my wrist. It's a kettle bell with a handle on the inside and you see over in the corner the Onnit Mace, hey, tell my feeling not athletic. I swing this bad boy. I love it. I think it's aesthetic and beautiful and uh, and, and make goes sir forwards. You can see all the other kit and then come this way because the home gym up slackline notice Lachlan got to have it up all the time. And then um, we decided that when we were finishing out the house, come on back real quick.

Speaker 1:          02:10          We made some tweaks to our pool design so, and this was directly influenced from Laird Hamilton, uh, all his work in the water, which you know, based on some interesting stuff he was doing. And then Wim Hoff course, another Brian Mackenzie and performance. But we went ahead and we made our pool 11 feet deep. So it's 11 feet, it's drop off, celebrate kid friendly pool. It drops straight down to box. And then, so we do a lot of interesting work around, come on this way, Jay would do a lot of interesting work around carrying the heavy ball. We have a hundred pound ball there. We've got dumbbells. Um, you can see all this stuff on XPT life. That's a double layered. His finally, you know, his, his vision, bringing in with Brian and whim. But, uh, this piece of it is a huge piece. So it's just about downregulation we're in the hot tub.

Speaker 1:          03:04          How many times a day you think, Jay? Probably two times a day at least in the summer. Maybe more. But uh, and then around the corner here you can see where, uh, we do normally have our boat storage for outriggers, but, uh, we have our little um, ice tank there. That's our ice bucket. Dumbbells for the pool, uh, a bin full of a million, a million snorkels and masks. And by the way, this is our home setup and I think ideas, you forget that we also have massive, massive outdoors and we have never lost track of the fact that you should be training to get outside. Anyway, this is the, uh, start at home health center, Jay store on the film.
