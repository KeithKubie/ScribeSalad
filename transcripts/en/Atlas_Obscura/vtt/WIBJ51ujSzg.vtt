00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.520
- What we're looking
at is a printing plate

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.460
from a World War II German operation

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.920
known as Operation Bernhard,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.360
in which the German Army attempted

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.350
to counterfeit British currency

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.460
to try to destroy the British economy.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.730
My name is Dr. Vince Houghton,

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.920
and I'm the historian and curator

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.690
of the International Spy
Museum here in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.630
The Spy Museum exists
to educate the public

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.310
about how important
intelligence work has been

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.460
throughout our history.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.120
The economy was the
strength of Great Britain

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.530
during the Second World War.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.080
But if you could strangle that,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.860
if you could destroy that foundation,

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.100
then you could bring the
British nation to its knees.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.520
The idea was to flood
Britain with fake currency,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.230
so that no one could trust

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.700
the British economic system.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.360
It evolved later on to
a way to launder money

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.910
and to create fake money
to pay German spies.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.250
So this plate represents
an extraordinary moment

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.240
in the Second World War.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.610
We think of the war as bombers and tanks,

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.950
and the blitzkrieg across Europe.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.810
But really, Germany was
thinking in different ways.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.000
This case is about economic espionage,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.870
about economic warfare.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.680
You can look at it and realize
how complicated this was.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.900
The British had installed
multiple security features.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.520
They had serial numbers that
were very well regulated.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.190
They had watermarks on the bills,

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.300
not to mention the fact
that the paper used

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.130
was very specific to British currency.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.980
When you touch it, it feels right.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.010
It feels like money is supposed to.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.520
Actually, it took a long time
for the Germans to figure out.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.070
So this Â£10 note is indicative

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.320
of how good these guys actually were

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.770
at counterfeiting this money.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.860
At the beginning of 1945,
the Germans realized

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.570
the war was coming to a close
and they were going to lose.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.040
The operation gathered up
all the printing plates

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.430
and all the fake currency

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.380
and decided to get rid of the evidence,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.300
and threw it into a deep lake in Austria,

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.830
hopefully to never be seen again.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.250
But we did find it.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.060
What's extraordinary
about this artifact is

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.050
it's the only surviving plate
from Operation Bernhard.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.830
We can actually make out the carving

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.380
and the artisanship and
how much craftsmanship

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.493
went into creating this object.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.250
The reason I like this artifact so much

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.870
is that it really bring across the idea

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.840
that you can win wars in different ways.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.280
This is indicative of
intelligence agencies

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.220
and governments trying to find the edge-

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.723
the way to defeat their
enemy any way possible.
