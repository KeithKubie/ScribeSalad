00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.390
Today's forecast: Sunny, with clouds rolling
in overnight, highs of 3300 degrees and a

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.470
chance of….

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.200
silicate downpours??

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.870
Hi there fellow alien folk, Trace here for
DNews.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.720
Obviously, we're not talking about Earth with
that forecast.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.270
Instead, this is a possible weather forecast
for distant “hot Jupiter” exoplanets,

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.380
according to new observations by NASA’s
Kepler space telescope: we know the weather

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.700
on other planets!

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.880
"Hot Jupiters" are one of the most commonly
found types of exoplanet.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.180
Like Jupiter, they're these massive gas giants,
but they orbit crazy close to their stars

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.830
-- making them, HOT.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.980
Like really, REALLY hot.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.140
As in as hot as a blow torch, hot.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.790
Because they are so close to their stars,
hot-Jupiters can orbit in less than 10 days.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.460
This means they become “tidally locked”
with their stars -- one hemisphere is always

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.290
facing the star in daylight, while the opposite
is in constant night.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.700
We know this, because of Kepler.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.920
Not Johannes, the telescope named after him.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.270
Kepler was launched in 2009 and is an an ace
exoplanet hunter (even though it broke in

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.020
2013 and couldn’t move at all, but that’s
another story).

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.310
When a planet passes in front of a star, it
blocks a tiny amount of starlight, and the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
space telescope measures the amount and timing
of that dimming and can then extrapolate the

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.140
size and orbital period of the passing planet
-- this is called a “transit.”

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.380
We have whole videos about it.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.310
But, Kepler doesn’t only detect the dimming
starlight of exoplanets; it can also detect

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.560
the light reflecting off exoplanets and see
the glow of their heated atmospheres!

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.149
This adds a whole new dimension to the study
of these extrasolar planets!

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.429
Now we can get to know their weather.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:44.850
In a new study published recently in The Astrophysical
Journal, astronomers were able to measure

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.749
the amount of light being reflected from these
hot-Jupiters as they orbit their stars.

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:53.930
Using the glow of the heated atmosphere, the
paper details how many clouds there are, what

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.670
chemicals those clouds are made of, AND even
where those clouds appear in the sky!

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.999
Depending on the chemical composition of the
exoplanet, the clouds could be in different

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.219
places or have different colors, and for the
hottest “hot-Jupiters”, the atmosphere

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.010
would glow like the embers of a fire after
the hellish heating from the exoplanet’s

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.010
star!

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.640
You can see the full range on the different
exoplanet temperatures and chemical compositions

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.750
here.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.750
Space is so awesome!

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.910
The researchers could even tell what the rain
on the planet would be like -- which is definitely

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.360
alien -- for example, some of these exoplanets
could drizzle silicate crystals.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.340
Basically, certain chemicals in the atmosphere
condense and “rain out," just like water

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.190
would here on our planet.

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.960
Obviously these planets are hundreds of light-years
away, so Kepler can't resolve tiny features

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.560
like "exo-clouds" DIRECTLY.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.320
Instead, the researchers used Kepler’s observation
and combined that with models for weather

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.830
and climate cycles here on Earth!

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.820
They used this to create models for the possible
weather conditions in alien atmospheres.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.530
A similar study published recently in the
journal Nature Astronomy learned that another

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.790
hot-Jupiter has clouds of the mineral corundum;
corundum forms rubies and sapphires here on

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:03.790
Earth.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.430
Can you imagine how beautiful those clouds
would appear from orbit?!

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.290
Look, understanding the weather on massive,
hellishly-hot worlds hundreds of light-years

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:18.080
away may not seem super important, but revealing
the weather systems on these hot-Jupiters

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.120
adds another level of understanding about
the rich diversity of alien atmospheres out

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.120
there.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.620
And, as astronomical techniques become more
sophisticated, it seems likely that we will

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.230
one day be able to study the weather systems
on nearby Earth-sized exoplanets, perhaps

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.300
revealing just how habitable these places
could be for alien life.

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.780
I say again, space is so.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.780
AWESOME.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.000
Hot-Jupiters sound pretty terrifying, but
they’re actually not the worst.To learn

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.430
But how do you think these space meteorologist
fare in comparison to your local meteorologist?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.560
