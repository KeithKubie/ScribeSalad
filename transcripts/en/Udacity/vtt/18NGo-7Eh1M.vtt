Welcome to the final third of the course. In the first section, you reviewed the

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.520
basic building blocks of the internet, and in

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.880
the second section, you learned how networks deal

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.710
with large amounts of network traffic. In

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.330
the final section, you'll learn how network operators

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.230
manage their networks. More importantly, these topics will

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.260
introduce you to the forefront of networking research.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.560
&gt;&gt; That's right. We're going to cover

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.690
software defined networking, traffic engineering, and network security.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; Let's get started.
