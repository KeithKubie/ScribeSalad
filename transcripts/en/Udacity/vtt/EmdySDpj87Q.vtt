00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.218
So to give you an example of the biological basis of introversion and

00:00:04.218 --> 00:00:09.551
extraversion. Researchers measured the level of introversion and extraversion

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:13.711
and then simply shined a light of the same intensity into everyone's eye, one

00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:18.420
at a time. As you know, pupils constrict when being exposed to a sudden

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.339
increase in light. So they get smaller. So based on Eysenck's theory of the

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.886
biological basis of introversion and extraversion. Whose pupil do you think

00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:34.344
will constrict or respond most to the light? Do you think introverts' eyes will

00:00:34.344 --> 00:00:38.478
constrict the most or extraverts'? Chose one.
