00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.380
Some people use the
letters FOIL as a strategy

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.870
for making sure they have
multiplied all the terms.

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:09.920
Use the FOIL
approach to multiply

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.680
3x plus 2 times 5x minus 7.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.180
I'm actually not
one of those people

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.910
who likes to use
the FOIL letters,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.844
because it's just a
form of memorization

00:00:18.844 --> 00:00:20.510
as opposed to realizing
that you're just

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.574
using the distributive
property twice.

00:00:22.574 --> 00:00:23.990
But with that said,
let's actually

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.200
use FOIL so you see
that it actually

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.460
is the same thing as using the
distributive property twice.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.150
So just to remember
FOIL, it literally stands

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:40.830
for-- so F-O-I-L. The F
in FOIL stands for First.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.570
The O stands for Outside.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.510
The I stands for Inside.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.552
And the L stands for Last.

00:00:49.552 --> 00:00:51.260
So not only do you
have to remember FOIL,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.630
you have to remember what
each of these letters

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.850
actually stand for.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.930
But let's see how that applies
to multiplying these two

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.990
binomials.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:11.280
So we have 3x plus
2 times 5x minus 7.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.295
So we're starting
with the first,

00:01:13.295 --> 00:01:14.845
we're starting with the F.

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.320
We have to multiply the first
terms in each of the binomials.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.020
So that's going
to be 3x times 5x.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.760
Then we do the outside terms.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.710
So that's going to be the
3x times the negative 7.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.610
So this is going to be
plus 3x times negative 7.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.400
Then we want to do
the inside terms.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.780
Then we want to do-- I'll
do that in green-- then

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.590
we want to do the inside terms.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.360
So that's the 2 and the 5x.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.770
So that's plus 2 times 5x.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.670
And then we want to
do the last terms.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.660
And the last terms are
the 2 and the negative 7,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.510
so plus 2 times negative 7.

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:07.589
And we end up getting 3x times
5x is 15x squared, plus--

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:09.130
or I should say
minus because there's

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.505
going to be a
negative sign here.

00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:15.980
So 3x times negative
7 is negative 21x.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.963
And then we have 2
times 5x is-- let

00:02:19.963 --> 00:02:22.710
me do that in that
same shade of green.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.340
So this is plus 10x.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.050
And then 2 times negative
7 is negative 14,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.942
or now it's minus 14.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.900
And we can add these two
middle terms together.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.775
If we have negative 21x and
then we add 10x to that,

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:43.070
that gives us negative 11x.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.350
So this right here
is negative 11x.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.680
And then these other
terms over here.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.290
We have 15x squared
minus 11x minus 14.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.614
So we just used FOIL.

00:02:54.614 --> 00:02:56.030
What I want to do
is show you this

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.630
is the same thing as applying
the distributive property

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.690
twice.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.560
So if we have-- I'll
rewrite the problem-- 3x

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.980
plus 2 times 5x minus 7.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.520
What we could do is
distribute the 5x minus 7.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.956
We can multiply
that times the 3x.

00:03:16.956 --> 00:03:18.330
And we could also
multiply that--

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.788
and let me make it
clear when I say

00:03:19.788 --> 00:03:23.230
that, I mean this whole 5x minus
7-- we can multiply it times

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.290
the 3x and by the 2.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.390
We're just distributing
it over the 3x plus 2.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:38.578
So we get literally
3x times 5x minus 7

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:51.410
plus 2 times 5x minus 7.

00:03:51.410 --> 00:04:00.030
And then this gives us 3x times
5x is going to be 15x squared.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.725
3x times negative 7 is
going to be negative 21x.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:09.680
And remember, in
this step we're just

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.610
applying the distributive
property again.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.440
So then we have 2 times 5x is
going to be 10x, so plus 10x.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.630
And then we have 2 times
negative 7 is negative 14.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.530
So we actually got
the exact same result

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.000
that we did when
we applied FOIL.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.474
And when you simplify it
you get this answer again.
