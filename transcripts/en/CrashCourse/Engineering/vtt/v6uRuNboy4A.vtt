00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.820
The future is going to require us to make
some dramatic changes to the way we produce
and consume electrical power.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.900
Climate change is happening whether we like it or not,
and switching to cleaner sources of energy is the main
way we’ll be able to keep it from getting worse.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.380
And we’ll run out of fossil fuels eventually
anyway.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:26.680
That’s why engineers are looking for ways to scale some
of the existing sources of energy that don’t rely on fossil
fuels, and maybe even find sources that are entirely new.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.300
There are all kinds of promising candidates
– from nuclear fusion to plain old hydrogen to
…poop.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:42.600
[Theme Music]

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.260
For at least the last 450 million years, another
form of life has been harvesting all it needs from the
sun without doing any harm to the planet.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.800
I’m talking about plants.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:59.480
The chlorophyll in a plant’s cells absorb light
and use its energy to combine carbon dioxide and
water to produce glucose and oxygen.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.820
That’s photosynthesis.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:08.400
Eliminating some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
and producing the oxygen we breathe is already pretty
great, but there’s another useful aspect to this.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.980
When the plants store some of that glucose,
it’s also storing chemical energy.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.380
And where there’s energy, there’s an engineer
who will find a way to use it.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.900
Biomass energy is a form of energy that relies
on burning biological matter, like plants, either
directly or by processing them into a fuel.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.020
As it burns, the chemical energy stored in
the plant’s matter is converted into heat.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.820
Like with many of the other energy sources
we’ve mentioned, the heat turns water into steam,
which in turn does work on a turbine;

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.140
in other words, it drives a heat engine.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.920
A generator then converts the turbine’s
motion into electrical power.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:49.040
About half of all biomass energy is delivered by
burning plant matter directly, which humans have
been doing long before the need for electrical power.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.880
A wood burning stove can keep your house warm
in the winter, or it can be used as a heat source for
something else – to cook pizza, for example.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:04.560
On a larger scale, scrap wood left over from wood processing or from waste produced by humans, along with food waste, can be burned in power plants more directly.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.040
Most of the other half of biomass energy comes
from processing biological matter into biogas
or biofuel.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.840
By pulping and chemically treating biomass
derived from crops and other plant matter,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.600
it becomes easier for special proteins called
enzymes to chemically break it down into a
more readily usable fuel source.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.460
One example of this is our old friend ethanol
– the type of alcohol you’ll also find in drinks.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.440
Ethanol is produced from enzymes breaking
down crops such as wheat or corn.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.320
That can then be turned into a liquid fuel
suitable for burning.

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.980
But it’s not just plants that we extract
energy from!

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.100
As certain types of agricultural waste, like
manure, decay, they can release what’s known
as biogas.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.260
These are gases like methane that can be burned
as a source of fuel.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.540
There’s also another small contributor to
biogas production: human waste.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.920
When I said engineers will find a way to get
energy from everything, I meant everything.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.240
Biofuels are already being used pretty widely.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.640
In Brazil, 4 out of every 5 cars produced
have hybrid engines capable of burning both
ordinary gasoline and bio-ethanol.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.300
To be clear, burning biomass fuels does
release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,
just like fossil fuels.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.840
But, because a nearly equivalent amount of
CO2 is captured from the atmosphere during
photosynthesis to store chemical energy,

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.220
on the balance of things, biomass energy is
what’s known as carbon neutral.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.120
We can also always grow more plants, which
makes biomass more renewable than fossil fuels.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.560
But given that plants absorb CO2 as they grow,
you could argue that we shouldn’t just release
it all back by burning them.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.500
And processing biomass into biofuels often
requires some amount of energy input, which
indirectly releases more CO2.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.580
Humans already use about a third of all the
CO2-absorbing plant matter on Earth.

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.200
Destroying even more of those plants to release
energy could be catastrophic for certain ecosystems.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.300
And even though we could grow more plants, we’d
have to trade off the use of land, water, and chemical
resources between growing food or providing energy.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.720
Demand for all of those resources is already high,
and projected to continue growing pretty quickly.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.580
As with any other power system, there are
places where engineers can make better of
use of what’s already there,

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.960
like improving the design of those hybrid engines
that burn both ordinary gasoline and biofuels.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.580
We also might be able to use different biomass
sources, like algae, or find more efficient chemical
reactions for processing biomass into fuel.

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.300
That might unlock new, more sustainable ways
to use biomass for power.

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.980
But there are other futuristic power sources
that don’t release any CO2 while being consumed.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.720
Although as we’ll see, that doesn’t mean
they’re carbon neutral!

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.180
Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the
universe, which makes it pretty surprising that
pure hydrogen is very rarely found on Earth.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:45.220
It consists of a single proton and electron, and
if you can produce it, it’s the perfect source of fuel
for the very aptly named hydrogen fuel cell.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.260
Fuel cells of this kind use a chemical reaction
between hydrogen and oxygen to directly generate
electrical power.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.220
And the only other byproduct of this
reaction is water.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.840
Much better than carbon dioxide.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.540
There’s a fairly big problem, though.

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.800
If hydrogen isn’t naturally produced on
Earth, how do you get it?

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.940
You can use the process known as electrolysis
to chemically separate water into hydrogen
and oxygen, and just store the hydrogen.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.800
Except, performing electrolysis uses energy.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.220
In fact, producing hydrogen fuel requires
more energy to produce than you get from using
it in a fuel cell.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.330
Efficiency-wise, that’s not great.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.800
But there are good arguments for having hydrogen
fuel cells in your power-producing arsenal.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:31.310
For starters, because hydrogen is the lightest
element, hydrogen fuel is incredibly lightweight, which
makes it great for transport, like on spacecraft.

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.760
And unlike solar-powered devices, if you
have hydrogen fuel at the ready, fuel cells don’t
require recharging like batteries.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.460
So they’re great for indoor vehicles like
forklifts, where releasing lots of fumes could
be problematic,

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:47.740
but you also need to use them pretty much
continuously, which makes batteries less practical.

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:55.000
Finally, if we can efficiently produce hydrogen
fuel by electrolysis from the surplus energy
provided by solar power on especially sunny days,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.300
hydrogen fuel could give us a carbon 
neutral way of storing electricity.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:07.200
On a larger scale, there is a power producing
process you’ve already heard of that’s already used
to provide a good deal of energy – 10% in the US –

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.770
while releasing comparatively tiny amounts
of CO2: nuclear fission.

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:16.160
In fission, an atom splits in two, releasing
a lot of energy in the process.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.060
Nuclear power releases the same amount or
even less of those greenhouse gases than most
renewable energy sources.

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.460
But don’t be fooled, it’s a non-renewable
source of energy!

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:34.280
The main fuel used in nuclear fission, uranium 2-3-5,
is a limited resource that has to be mined and purified
from the ground, much like fossil fuels.

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:40.560
The way we get power from uranium is by
assembling rods of uranium parallel to one another
and setting up a chain reaction.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:45.060
The nucleus, or core, of a uranium atom is
made up of protons and neutrons.

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:51.240
If a fast moving neutron hits a uranium atom at
just the right energy, it can split the uranium in two.

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.940
The uranium splits into atoms of other elements,
like krypton and barium.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.289
But three of the neutrons from the nucleus
will fly off, carrying some energy with them.

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:07.000
Those neutrons can then collide with another
uranium atom, causing fission that releases
even more neutrons, and so on.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.760
Meanwhile, the cascade of splitting atoms
gives off gamma radiation and heat, heating
up the reactor.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.560
So fission turns a nuclear reactor into a
heat source for a power plant.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:24.300
Unfortunately, once you’ve used up all the useful
uranium in the rods, you’re left over with the biggest
setback of nuclear power: nuclear waste.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:32.900
Nuclear waste consists of radioactive material that
emits highly energetic particles that can be extremely
dangerous for any living thing, including humans.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.720
Dealing with it safely is the sort of issue
nuclear engineers can help with.

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.520
They also design nuclear power plants to
carefully control fission to stop it turning into
a runaway process.

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.280
If that happens, it can lead to disasters
like the kind that happened in Chernobyl or
Fukushima.

00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:52.880
As for nuclear waste, nuclear engineers aim
to find as safe a way as possible for disposing
of it.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.920
Most of the time, used-up uranium rods are put into
thick steel containers and buried in deep underground
vaults far from any people,

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.840
or kept in tanks near the nuclear power
plants themselves.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:09.280
Neither of these solutions is ideal, and engineers
may find a better way of handling the problem
in the future.

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:16.660
But it would be better if we could find a
way of generating nuclear power that produces
no radioactive fuel as waste at all.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.320
Which is where nuclear fusion comes in.

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.460
It’s the same energy-releasing process that
occurs in the sun.

00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:25.940
So naturally, getting it to happen here on
Earth is something many engineers are looking
into!

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:34.160
In fact, the National Academy of Engineers in the US
has declared the goal of providing energy from fusion
one of its grand challenges for the 21st Century,

00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.480
in addition to the improved solar power we
talked about last time.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:43.400
The major setbacks to providing energy from
fusion are the intense amounts of heat and
pressure that atoms need to fuse.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:51.600
Without the gravitational strength of the sun on hand,
nuclear physicists and engineers have to design some
of the world’s most powerful magnets to contain plasma:

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:56.480
an extremely hot gas made up of ions, or
atoms with an electric charge.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:09:03.520
Unfortunately, the magnets require energy to operate,
so fusion has to deliver more power than the magnets
consume for it to be useful.

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:05.800
And we haven’t figured out how to do that
yet.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:15.480
In 2018, a test reactor in the U.K. announced they’d
reached temperatures of 15 million °C in a plasma –
well on the way to a sustainable fusion reaction.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:21.240
And currently under construction in the South
of France is what will be the world’s biggest
fusion plant, called ITER.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:32.220
The design is still experimental, but the hope is that it will be capable of delivering the first ever self-sustaining fusion process capable of generating more power than the magnets consume.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:38.800
Engineers have already contributed to the
effort by designing more efficient magnets
and contributing to the design of ITER itself.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:44.520
But if fusion ends up being a suitable power
source, they’ll have a lot more work left to do
to scale it for wider use.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.080
Between the sources like solar and wind power
we talked about last time,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:55.560
and less-developed tech like nuclear fusion, there
are lots of different ways we can change the future
of energy for a world less reliant on fossil fuels.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:10:01.160
No matter what, we’ll need a new power infrastructure
to support the cleaner energy world of the future.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:05.300
And that infrastructure, that future, will
be built by engineers.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.710
In this episode we looked at alternative energy
sources.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:14.740
We saw how biomass can be burned as a fuel
source, how hydrogen can be used in a fuel
cell to generate electrical power,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.780
and how nuclear fission provides power to the grid.

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:22.700
Finally, we saw how nuclear fusion might someday
do the same without any radioactive waste.

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:27.840
Next time, we’ll be looking at ways of storing
all that power when we look at energy storage
and batteries.
