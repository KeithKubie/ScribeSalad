00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.092
If you ever go to a music festival,

00:00:02.292 --> 00:00:04.513
especially a music festival in the UK,

00:00:04.713 --> 00:00:07.075
you might come across the problem that

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.763
there's always lots of toilets for you
to choose from

00:00:09.963 --> 00:00:12.118
and the problem with these toilets is

00:00:12.318 --> 00:00:14.077
they're not always that well
looked after.

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:16.509
And I have been to quite a few music festivals,

00:00:16.709 --> 00:00:19.420
and numerous times have I come
across this problem.

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:28.802
So, the mathematical part of this problem is:

00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.169
Let's say that you're in the queue
and you get to the first toilet

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.740
and you open the door
and it's really not that nice.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.925
You really don't want to use that toilet.

00:00:38.125 --> 00:00:40.243
So it's OK. You can try the next toilet.

00:00:40.443 --> 00:00:44.661
You open the door, but it might be
marginally better but still not that good.

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:47.780
The problem is you've got
hundreds of these toilets,

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.316
and how do you know which toilet
to stop on

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:52.470
and decide "Yeh, I'm going to
use that toilet,"

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.857
so you don't have to try them all.

00:00:55.128 --> 00:00:57.781
There must be a certain number,
an optimum number we can look at.

00:00:57.981 --> 00:01:01.306
So, there are two things that
we do need to stick to on this problem.

00:01:01.506 --> 00:01:04.319
The first is that ideally
I'm looking for the best toilet,

00:01:04.615 --> 00:01:06.627
the most hygienic,
the cleanest toilet.

00:01:06.827 --> 00:01:11.646
One with plenty of toilet paper in there,
hand sanitizer... has been looked after.

00:01:11.846 --> 00:01:15.328
Number two is that you can't go back
to a previous toilet.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.987
There are people queuing behind you.

00:01:17.187 --> 00:01:19.419
If you reject a toilet
you can't go back to it.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.998
So I start with a small example
where the number toilets

00:01:23.198 --> 00:01:24.601
is actually quite small
to begin with.

00:01:24.815 --> 00:01:27.572
It's a small music festival,
just so that we can see what's happening.

00:01:27.946 --> 00:01:28.972
So, there are my three toilets.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:32.484
Now, I'm going to number them
1, 2 and 3,

00:01:32.684 --> 00:01:36.159
and the numbers relate to
how hygienic they are.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.270
So, number 1 is the best toilet,
the most hygienic.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.438
Number 2 not quite as hygienic.

00:01:41.638 --> 00:01:44.520
Number 3 the worst.
You certainly wouldn't want to choose this one.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.172
OK, so the toilets at the moment
are lined up in this order.

00:01:47.372 --> 00:01:50.252
but it's not necessarily going to be
always this order.

00:01:50.452 --> 00:01:51.832
I could have came to the toilets

00:01:52.032 --> 00:01:55.221
and actually number 1 might have been
in the first position

00:01:55.421 --> 00:01:57.841
but number 3 could have been second

00:01:58.041 --> 00:01:59.814
and number 2 could have been third.

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:02.185
And if you think about
the number of permutations

00:02:02.385 --> 00:02:04.661
of the order of these toilets,
there are actually 4 more.

00:02:04.861 --> 00:02:09.152
So there are 6 permutations,
which is 3 factorial.

00:02:09.352 --> 00:02:12.113
So the likelihood that the first toilet
you are going to is the cleanest

00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:15.693
is quite slim, especially if the number
of toilets gets larger.

00:02:15.893 --> 00:02:19.715
So let's say that we're always
going to reject the first toilet,

00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:23.585
and then will choose the next best
out of our options.

00:02:23.785 --> 00:02:27.148
So if we take consideration
of the first example,

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:29.389
we're going to reject toilet 1,

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.113
even though it is the best,
I don't know it's the best

00:02:32.313 --> 00:02:33.341
because I can't compare it yet.

00:02:33.541 --> 00:02:36.411
I then take the best possible
option after that.

00:02:36.611 --> 00:02:40.402
2 - when I compare it to 1 is worse,
so I can't take 2.

00:02:40.602 --> 00:02:44.148
3 - although it is also worse
than 1 and 2,

00:02:44.348 --> 00:02:45.933
I have no more toilets left to choose,

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:49.513
so, unfortunately, I have to go with
the worst toilet in this case.

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:51.262
Brady Haran: It's a bad ending.
Dr. Symonds: Bad ending.

00:02:51.462 --> 00:02:54.692
If I take the second case,
again, I reject the first toilet,

00:02:54.892 --> 00:02:57.302
3 is worse than 1 so I reject 3

00:02:57.502 --> 00:02:59.581
and this time I have to select 2.

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:01.450
We move on to the third example.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.042
I reject 2.
Now, 1 is better than 2,

00:03:05.325 --> 00:03:08.203
so, because it is better, I choose
that one straight away and I stop.

00:03:08.403 --> 00:03:10.771
I first reject 2 on the fourth example,

00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:14.989
3 is worse than 2,
so I move on to the next toilet

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:17.506
and because it's the last toilet
I select that toilet.

00:03:17.706 --> 00:03:19.352
And from here I reject 3,

00:03:19.552 --> 00:03:23.043
1 is better than 3
so I select 1 and I stop.

00:03:23.243 --> 00:03:26.239
Here is reject 3,
2 is better than 3

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.849
so this time I select 2
and I stop.

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:30.865
So if I take a look
at how many times

00:03:31.065 --> 00:03:34.470
I actually chose the best toilet,
the most hygienic.

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.207
There are 1, 2, 3.

00:03:37.407 --> 00:03:41.976
So there are 3 out of 6 chance,
or a half,

00:03:42.176 --> 00:03:44.455
which is 50 percent chance

00:03:44.655 --> 00:03:48.355
that one would have chosen
the correct most hygienic toilet.

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:51.201
OK, So this is fine for
when you have 3 toilets,

00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:52.961
but what happens when
you have 4?

00:03:53.161 --> 00:03:57.690
With 4 toilets
we now have 24 different permutations.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.617
We have to consider every single one.

00:03:59.817 --> 00:04:02.514
Now, if you work through it in the same way

00:04:02.714 --> 00:04:05.470
we'll find that we're actually
only successful on

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.224
11 out of 24 of those opportunities,

00:04:09.424 --> 00:04:13.142
which is a percentage of about
46 percent.

00:04:13.342 --> 00:04:15.553
Brady Haran: This is successful for
finding the best possible toilet.

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:17.078
Dr. Symonds: The best possible toilet,

00:04:17.278 --> 00:04:18.500
so toilet number 1.

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.110
So the percentage has already decreased

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.507
by only including one extra toilet.

00:04:25.707 --> 00:04:28.749
As n gets larger, i.e.
the number of toilets gets larger,

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.713
this percentage gets smaller
and smaller and smaller.

00:04:31.913 --> 00:04:36.026
So the idea of rejecting the first toilet
and taking the next best after that

00:04:36.226 --> 00:04:37.288
is quite limited.

00:04:37.488 --> 00:04:41.395
We can see that as n gets large
it doesn't give us an optimal solution.

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:44.543
So, of course at music festivals there are
hundreds of toilets,

00:04:44.743 --> 00:04:49.728
so we'd like a solution that gives us
a better approximation for this percentage,

00:04:49.928 --> 00:04:53.532
to give us a better likelihood of
finding the best toilet.

00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:55.864
So we're going to do it
with a little bit of math.

00:04:56.064 --> 00:04:57.257
Brady Haran: I'm going to stop the video here,

00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:00.732
because as you probably guessed
things are about to get pretty mathematical.

00:05:00.932 --> 00:05:02.406
So I'm going to give you a choice.

00:05:02.606 --> 00:05:07.175
If you want to see all the mathematics
that leads to the answer here

00:05:07.375 --> 00:05:09.261
go to the Numberphile 2 channel

00:05:09.461 --> 00:05:11.980
and I have put all the rest of this video there.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.781
It's a bit over 15 minutes long.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:18.113
If you haven't got time for that,
you want to just get straight to the answer,

00:05:18.313 --> 00:05:20.264
maybe you're late to
a music festival yourself,

00:05:20.464 --> 00:05:23.490
stay here and we'll cut
straight to the chase.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.272
But I do recommend the mathematics,
it's really interesting.

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:29.225
I think most people will follow it,
and there's more really good animations from Pete.

00:05:30.425 --> 00:05:37.094
So... Make a choice...
I'll give you a second.

00:05:37.294 --> 00:05:38.770
OK, So here is the deal.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.559
Once Dr. Symonds has done all the mathematics,
it comes down to this.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:49.321
The base thing to do is to look inside
37 percent of the toilets.

00:05:49.521 --> 00:05:53.121
And after you hit that 37 percent
tipping point,

00:05:53.321 --> 00:05:58.477
you choose the first toilet after that
that's better than everything that came before.

00:05:58.677 --> 00:06:03.161
That gives you the best chance
of ending up in the best toilet.

00:06:03.361 --> 00:06:06.340
That doesn't mean you can skip that
first 37 percent.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.428
You've actually got to look inside
them unfortunately,

00:06:08.628 --> 00:06:13.460
so that you can make the comparison
after you've gone past the tipping point,

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:16.205
after you've gone past that
37 percent.

00:06:16.405 --> 00:06:21.082
To make it really simple
imagine Glastonbury, imagine a 100 toilets.

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:25.175
You got to look inside 37,
and after the 37th

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:29.880
pick the first one after that,
that's better than what came before.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:33.051
Dr. Symonds: So we've used the example
of choosing the best toilet,

00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:36.897
but this a famous mathematical problem
that you may have seen before

00:06:37.097 --> 00:06:38.020
in a different context.

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.335
You may have heard of it before
called "The Secretary Problem",

00:06:41.535 --> 00:06:42.873
which is the same process.

00:06:43.073 --> 00:06:47.055
This time you want to find
the best secretary for the job,

00:06:47.255 --> 00:06:50.105
but you were going to interview
an n number of people,

00:06:50.305 --> 00:06:51.717
say maybe a 100 people.

00:06:51.917 --> 00:06:56.699
You can only accept or reject each secretary
once they've been interviewed.

00:06:56.899 --> 00:07:00.770
So when do you stop interviewing
those secretaries

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.838
and start accepting one of them
hoping that you have the best for the job?

00:07:05.038 --> 00:07:08.525
Or another famous use of this
is in the dating world.

00:07:08.725 --> 00:07:12.000
If you want to find the best partner,
your soul mate out there,

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.511
then how many people should you date
before you should start accepting

00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:18.935
and settling down with that
next person

00:07:19.135 --> 00:07:22.058
and hoping that that is the person
you're supposed to be with

00:07:22.258 --> 00:07:23.478
for the rest of your life.

00:07:23.678 --> 00:07:26.314
Brady Haran: Thanks for watching.
Just a reminder,

00:07:26.514 --> 00:07:29.115
you can still go and look at all
the mathematics behind this

00:07:29.315 --> 00:07:30.546
over Numberphile 2.

00:07:30.746 --> 00:07:33.447
You've got all the stuff worked out
by Dr. Symonds

00:07:33.647 --> 00:07:36.007
and more excellent animations
from Pete McPartlan.

00:07:36.207 --> 00:07:39.022
We don't actually expect people to do this
at music festivals, by the way.

00:07:39.222 --> 00:07:41.632
It's just a bit of a fun twist on
an old problem

00:07:41.832 --> 00:07:43.481
that everyone talks about all the time.

00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:46.133
We didn't want to make it about
secretaries and dating,

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:48.088
so, why not toilets?
