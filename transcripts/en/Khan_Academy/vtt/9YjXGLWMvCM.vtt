00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
At Hogwarts, there are
four houses-- Gryffindor,

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.460
Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw,
and Slytherin.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.550
The bar chart below shows
the number of house points

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.320
that each house received today.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.550
How many house points
did Hufflepuff receive?

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.120
So if we look at
this bar chart, we

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.980
could assume that this column
right over here is Hufflepuff,

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.530
because it's the
only one that starts

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.430
with an H. This will be
Gryffindor, this is Ravenclaw,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.760
and this must be Slytherin.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.840
And so, if we look
at Hufflepuff's bar,

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.660
it looks like they have
3 points scored today.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.160
So let's put 3 points.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.920
All right, let's try one more.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.330
So here they're saying,
how many house points

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:41.830
did Slytherin receive?

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:43.640
So this is going
to be Slytherin,

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.220
and it looks like they
received 4 points.
