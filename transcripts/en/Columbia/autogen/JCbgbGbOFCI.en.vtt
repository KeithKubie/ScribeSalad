why not for a more complicated

00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720
why not for a more complicated
 

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:03.629
why not for a more complicated
arrangement which would be to have

00:26:03.629 --> 00:26:03.639
arrangement which would be to have
 

00:26:03.639 --> 00:26:06.180
arrangement which would be to have
multiple jurisdictions why not have you

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.190
multiple jurisdictions why not have you
 

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.570
multiple jurisdictions why not have you
know you know one giant federal this

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:09.580
know you know one giant federal this
 

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.389
know you know one giant federal this
jurisdiction for a use-of-force say and

00:26:12.389 --> 00:26:12.399
jurisdiction for a use-of-force say and
 

00:26:12.399 --> 00:26:14.399
jurisdiction for a use-of-force say and
then you know a federation of countries

00:26:14.399 --> 00:26:14.409
then you know a federation of countries
 

00:26:14.409 --> 00:26:16.019
then you know a federation of countries
that can implement whatever cultural

00:26:16.019 --> 00:26:16.029
that can implement whatever cultural
 

00:26:16.029 --> 00:26:19.940
that can implement whatever cultural

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:19.950
policies they want say at a lower level
 

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:22.409
policies they want say at a lower level
you know we see this kind of approach of

00:26:22.409 --> 00:26:22.419
you know we see this kind of approach of
 

00:26:22.419 --> 00:26:23.850
you know we see this kind of approach of
multiple jurisdictions within many

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:23.860
multiple jurisdictions within many
 

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:26.399
multiple jurisdictions within many
countries currently you know there's

00:26:26.399 --> 00:26:26.409
countries currently you know there's
 

00:26:26.409 --> 00:26:28.019
countries currently you know there's
local control over school districts and

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:28.029
local control over school districts and
 

00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:30.389
local control over school districts and
so on arguably in the medieval period

00:26:30.389 --> 00:26:30.399
so on arguably in the medieval period
 

00:26:30.399 --> 00:26:31.919
so on arguably in the medieval period
you had a very elaborate system that

00:26:31.919 --> 00:26:31.929
you had a very elaborate system that
 

00:26:31.929 --> 00:26:33.330
you had a very elaborate system that
we're overlapping jurisdictions

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:33.340
we're overlapping jurisdictions
 

00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:35.129
we're overlapping jurisdictions
religious and princely and economic and

00:26:35.129 --> 00:26:35.139
religious and princely and economic and
 

00:26:35.139 --> 00:26:37.860
religious and princely and economic and
so on that did not involve territory

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:37.870
so on that did not involve territory
 

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:39.299
so on that did not involve territory

jurisdictions with some overlapping and

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:47.950
jurisdictions with some overlapping and
 

00:26:47.950 --> 00:26:50.399
jurisdictions with some overlapping and
some not now Alice eNOS Villar I kind of

00:26:50.399 --> 00:26:50.409
some not now Alice eNOS Villar I kind of
 

00:26:50.409 --> 00:26:52.049
some not now Alice eNOS Villar I kind of
realized that this is a possibility but

00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:52.059
realized that this is a possibility but
 

00:26:52.059 --> 00:26:54.619
realized that this is a possibility but
they sort of push it to the side by

00:26:54.619 --> 00:26:54.629
they sort of push it to the side by
 

00:26:54.629 --> 00:26:58.860
they sort of push it to the side by
introducing a concept called economies

are costs you know that it can be more

kind of force getting territorial

kind of force getting territorial
sovereignty that way but if we think

00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279
sovereignty that way but if we think
 

00:27:15.279 --> 00:27:16.830
sovereignty that way but if we think
about the specific structure of the

00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:16.840
about the specific structure of the
 

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:20.159
about the specific structure of the

going to explain why it wouldn't always

be best to have a world government kind

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:24.940
be best to have a world government kind
 

00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:26.490
be best to have a world government kind
of at the highest level of jurisdiction

00:27:26.490 --> 00:27:26.500
of at the highest level of jurisdiction

to minimize you know defense cost

00:27:29.159 --> 00:27:29.169
to minimize you know defense cost

there are significant heterogeneity and

there are significant heterogeneity and
 

00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:37.769
there are significant heterogeneity and
preferences I think the real problem

00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:37.779
preferences I think the real problem
 

00:27:37.779 --> 00:27:39.330
preferences I think the real problem
with that kind of solution is how to

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:39.340
with that kind of solution is how to
 

00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.340
with that kind of solution is how to
guarantee the control of the defense or

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:41.350
guarantee the control of the defense or
 

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:43.919
guarantee the control of the defense or

wouldn't be hijacked by a minority that

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:46.090
wouldn't be hijacked by a minority that
 

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.269
wouldn't be hijacked by a minority that
would try to impose its particular

cultural preferences for example on

00:27:50.730 --> 00:27:50.740
cultural preferences for example on
 

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:54.230

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:57.600
 
so okay last argument for why we have

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:57.610
so okay last argument for why we have
 

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:01.129
so okay last argument for why we have
anarchy this one from Hobbes so

00:28:01.129 --> 00:28:01.139
anarchy this one from Hobbes so
 

00:28:01.139 --> 00:28:03.210
anarchy this one from Hobbes so
basically a one sentence remark in

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:03.220
basically a one sentence remark in
 

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:04.409
basically a one sentence remark in
Hobbes which is a very interesting

00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:04.419
Hobbes which is a very interesting
 

00:28:04.419 --> 00:28:06.600
Hobbes which is a very interesting
suggestion why didn't Hobbes argue for

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:06.610
suggestion why didn't Hobbes argue for
 

00:28:06.610 --> 00:28:08.190
suggestion why didn't Hobbes argue for
world government if he thought that

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:08.200
world government if he thought that
 

00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:09.779
world government if he thought that
anarchy was such a terrible thing and he

00:28:09.779 --> 00:28:09.789
anarchy was such a terrible thing and he
 

00:28:09.789 --> 00:28:10.990
anarchy was such a terrible thing and he
certainly did think that and

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000
certainly did think that and
 

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.290
certainly did think that and
was a really terrible thing and you know

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:14.300
was a really terrible thing and you know
 

00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:15.550
was a really terrible thing and you know
one of the things he did with he

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:15.560
one of the things he did with he
 

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.440
one of the things he did with he
famously gives international politics as

famously gives international politics as
 

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.510
famously gives international politics as
an example you say look you can see what

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520
an example you say look you can see what
 

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.580
an example you say look you can see what
happens between states this is the bad

00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:21.590
happens between states this is the bad
 

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.960
happens between states this is the bad
stuff that happens with anarchy

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:22.970
stuff that happens with anarchy
 

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:24.610
stuff that happens with anarchy
why didn't he then follow that on and

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:24.620
why didn't he then follow that on and
 

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.770
why didn't he then follow that on and
say well why did he offer argue for

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:26.780
say well why did he offer argue for
 

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.090
say well why did he offer argue for
monarchy but not for a universal

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:28.100
monarchy but not for a universal
 

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.610
monarchy but not for a universal
monarchy he says essentially nothing

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:30.620
monarchy he says essentially nothing
 

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.350
monarchy he says essentially nothing
about this except for one line at the

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:32.360
about this except for one line at the
 

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.090
about this except for one line at the
end of the famous chapter 13 which is

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.100
end of the famous chapter 13 which is
 

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.710
end of the famous chapter 13 which is
which is up here and he gives you this

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720
which is up here and he gives you this
 

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:37.900
which is up here and he gives you this
example of the anarchy of IR and then he

00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:37.910
example of the anarchy of IR and then he
 

00:28:37.910 --> 00:28:40.630
example of the anarchy of IR and then he
says but because the princes there you

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640
says but because the princes there you
 

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.160
says but because the princes there you
know uphold their by the industry of

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.170
know uphold their by the industry of
 

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:43.960

their subjects there does not follow

from it that misery which accompanies

00:28:45.610 --> 00:28:45.620
from it that misery which accompanies
 

00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:49.150
from it that misery which accompanies
the liberty of particular men so this

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:49.160
the liberty of particular men so this
 

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.230
the liberty of particular men so this
appears to be an argument that

00:28:50.230 --> 00:28:50.240
appears to be an argument that
 

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.630
appears to be an argument that
international anarchy is not such a bad

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640
international anarchy is not such a bad
 

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:55.530
international anarchy is not such a bad
thing as domestic anarchy let's call it

00:28:55.530 --> 00:28:55.540
thing as domestic anarchy let's call it
 

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:57.940
thing as domestic anarchy let's call it
because the competition among Kings

00:28:57.940 --> 00:28:57.950
because the competition among Kings
 

00:28:57.950 --> 00:29:00.430
because the competition among Kings
causes them to want their countries to

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:00.440
causes them to want their countries to
 

00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.050
causes them to want their countries to
be economically prosperous so they can

00:29:02.050 --> 00:29:02.060
be economically prosperous so they can
 

00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:05.620
be economically prosperous so they can
defend their Thrones so the idea being

defend their Thrones so the idea being
 

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.020
defend their Thrones so the idea being
that this international competition

that this international competition
 

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:09.880
that this international competition
limits monarchs abuses of their own

observation here but if you think about

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:28.370
observation here but if you think about
 

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:29.980
observation here but if you think about
it's not really an answer the question

00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:29.990
it's not really an answer the question
 

00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:31.000
it's not really an answer the question
of why anarchy

of why anarchy
 

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:32.200

that all right so so why international

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:09.140
that all right so so why international

think the right answer is pretty obvious

think the right answer is pretty obvious
 

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.680
think the right answer is pretty obvious
but that it's not been fleshed out

but that it's not been fleshed out
 

00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:16.750
but that it's not been fleshed out
because the question we just don't ask

the question and that you know fleshing

and anarchy so let's think again about a

and anarchy so let's think again about a
two-state world and they're gonna have

00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880
two-state world and they're gonna have
 

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.960
two-state world and they're gonna have

budgets government budgets g1 and g2 and
 

00:38:45.970 --> 00:38:48.240

they're gonna choose and successively

they make a choice like they decide how

00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359
they make a choice like they decide how
 

00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:56.580
they make a choice like they decide how
much to spend on arms and then whether

00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:56.590
much to spend on arms and then whether
 

00:38:56.590 --> 00:38:58.410
much to spend on arms and then whether
to use that to attack the other side and

00:38:58.410 --> 00:38:58.420
to use that to attack the other side and
 

00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.120
to use that to attack the other side and
if you attack the other side there's a

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.130
if you attack the other side there's a
 

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.019
if you attack the other side there's a
chance of winning which

00:39:01.019 --> 00:39:01.029
chance of winning which
 

00:39:01.029 --> 00:39:03.359
chance of winning which
depends on the arm the balance of arms

00:39:03.359 --> 00:39:03.369
depends on the arm the balance of arms
 

00:39:03.369 --> 00:39:04.649
depends on the arm the balance of arms
and obviously the more arms you have

00:39:04.649 --> 00:39:04.659
and obviously the more arms you have
 

00:39:04.659 --> 00:39:06.659
and obviously the more arms you have
better your chances of winning more arms

00:39:06.659 --> 00:39:06.669
better your chances of winning more arms
 

00:39:06.669 --> 00:39:08.519
better your chances of winning more arms
the other guy has the lower your chances

00:39:08.519 --> 00:39:08.529
the other guy has the lower your chances
 

00:39:08.529 --> 00:39:11.519
the other guy has the lower your chances
of winning going to war it's gonna be

00:39:11.519 --> 00:39:11.529
of winning going to war it's gonna be
 

00:39:11.529 --> 00:39:13.189
of winning going to war it's gonna be
decisive one state wins the other loses

you can handle that that's that's a

00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:21.999
you can handle that that's that's a
 

00:39:21.999 --> 00:39:24.059
you can handle that that's that's a
simple way to do it and then finally big

simple way to do it and then finally big
 

00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:25.529

big thing I'm going to talk about two

00:39:25.529 --> 00:39:25.539
big thing I'm going to talk about two
 

00:39:25.539 --> 00:39:27.209
big thing I'm going to talk about two
types of states democracies and

00:39:27.209 --> 00:39:27.219
types of states democracies and
 

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:30.719
types of states democracies and
autocracies so in an autocracy these gee

00:39:30.719 --> 00:39:30.729
autocracies so in an autocracy these gee
 

00:39:30.729 --> 00:39:32.219
autocracies so in an autocracy these gee
numbers the government budgets those are

00:39:32.219 --> 00:39:32.229
numbers the government budgets those are
 

00:39:32.229 --> 00:39:34.140
numbers the government budgets those are
like rents for the autocrat stuff you

00:39:34.140 --> 00:39:34.150
like rents for the autocrat stuff you
 

00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:37.169
like rents for the autocrat stuff you
can spend on your palace you know having

00:39:37.169 --> 00:39:37.179
can spend on your palace you know having
 

00:39:37.179 --> 00:39:41.069
can spend on your palace you know having
a garden at Versailles etcetera things

00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079
a garden at Versailles etcetera things
 

00:39:41.079 --> 00:39:42.049
a garden at Versailles etcetera things
like that

00:39:42.049 --> 00:39:42.059
like that
 

00:39:42.059 --> 00:39:43.859
like that
alternatively we can think of

00:39:43.859 --> 00:39:43.869
alternatively we can think of
 

00:39:43.869 --> 00:39:46.199
alternatively we can think of
democracies where we think of the

00:39:46.199 --> 00:39:46.209
democracies where we think of the
 

00:39:46.209 --> 00:39:47.429
democracies where we think of the
governed by just this is stuff you can

00:39:47.429 --> 00:39:47.439
governed by just this is stuff you can
 

00:39:47.439 --> 00:39:49.249
governed by just this is stuff you can
spend on public goods or that's you know

00:39:49.249 --> 00:39:49.259
spend on public goods or that's you know
 

00:39:49.259 --> 00:39:52.309
spend on public goods or that's you know
stuff that goes to public goods you know

00:39:52.309 --> 00:39:52.319
stuff that goes to public goods you know
 

00:39:52.319 --> 00:39:54.449
stuff that goes to public goods you know
whatever you don't spend on arms and

00:39:54.449 --> 00:39:54.459
whatever you don't spend on arms and
 

00:39:54.459 --> 00:39:56.069
whatever you don't spend on arms and
stuff that's spent on them for the

00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079
stuff that's spent on them for the
 

00:39:56.079 --> 00:39:57.439
stuff that's spent on them for the
benefit of the public

00:39:57.439 --> 00:39:57.449
benefit of the public
 

00:39:57.449 --> 00:40:02.069
benefit of the public
hopefully okay so what happens in that

00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079
hopefully okay so what happens in that
 

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.299
hopefully okay so what happens in that
world well there was basically two

00:40:06.559 --> 00:40:06.569
possible outcomes you can either have
 

00:40:06.569 --> 00:40:09.959
possible outcomes you can either have
you know the the parameters are such

00:40:09.959 --> 00:40:09.969
you know the the parameters are such
 

00:40:09.969 --> 00:40:12.059
you know the the parameters are such
that there will be a stable balance of

00:40:12.059 --> 00:40:12.069
that there will be a stable balance of
 

00:40:12.069 --> 00:40:14.640
that there will be a stable balance of
power at positive arms levels so I'm

00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:14.650
power at positive arms levels so I'm
 

00:40:14.650 --> 00:40:15.719
power at positive arms levels so I'm
going to talk about autocrats

00:40:15.719 --> 00:40:15.729
going to talk about autocrats
 

00:40:15.729 --> 00:40:17.449
going to talk about autocrats
okay so first let's talk about autocrats

00:40:17.449 --> 00:40:17.459
okay so first let's talk about autocrats
 

00:40:17.459 --> 00:40:20.069
okay so first let's talk about autocrats
who you know just consume what they

00:40:20.069 --> 00:40:20.079
who you know just consume what they
 

00:40:20.079 --> 00:40:21.809
who you know just consume what they
don't spend on arm arms as rent so

00:40:21.809 --> 00:40:21.819
don't spend on arm arms as rent so
 

00:40:21.819 --> 00:40:25.409
don't spend on arm arms as rent so
that's what they want in the in the

00:40:25.409 --> 00:40:25.419
that's what they want in the in the
 

00:40:25.419 --> 00:40:26.459
that's what they want in the in the
simple game there's two things that

00:40:26.459 --> 00:40:26.469
simple game there's two things that
 

00:40:26.469 --> 00:40:28.319
simple game there's two things that
could happen there could be levels of

00:40:28.319 --> 00:40:28.329
could happen there could be levels of
 

00:40:28.329 --> 00:40:30.059
could happen there could be levels of
spending such that each side is happy to

00:40:30.059 --> 00:40:30.069
spending such that each side is happy to
 

00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:31.499
spending such that each side is happy to
live with that level of spending and

00:40:31.499 --> 00:40:31.509
live with that level of spending and
 

00:40:31.509 --> 00:40:34.649
live with that level of spending and
doesn't and is doesn't see an advantage

00:40:34.649 --> 00:40:34.659
doesn't and is doesn't see an advantage
 

00:40:34.659 --> 00:40:36.899
doesn't and is doesn't see an advantage
to ramping up in a period and attacking

00:40:36.899 --> 00:40:36.909
to ramping up in a period and attacking
 

00:40:36.909 --> 00:40:41.729
to ramping up in a period and attacking
the other side and and so you know we

00:40:41.729 --> 00:40:41.739
the other side and and so you know we
 

00:40:41.739 --> 00:40:43.199
the other side and and so you know we
got a stable balance of power each

00:40:43.199 --> 00:40:43.209
got a stable balance of power each
 

00:40:43.209 --> 00:40:45.059
got a stable balance of power each
period and this is an inefficient

00:40:45.059 --> 00:40:45.069
period and this is an inefficient
 

00:40:45.069 --> 00:40:46.649
period and this is an inefficient
outcome they're spending money on arms

00:40:46.649 --> 00:40:46.659
outcome they're spending money on arms
 

00:40:46.659 --> 00:40:47.880
outcome they're spending money on arms
they'd rather be able to strike a deal

00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:47.890
they'd rather be able to strike a deal
 

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:50.489
they'd rather be able to strike a deal
where they don't spend anything but

00:40:50.489 --> 00:40:50.499
where they don't spend anything but
 

00:40:50.499 --> 00:40:52.919
where they don't spend anything but
that's not stable because you know once

00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:52.929
that's not stable because you know once
 

00:40:52.929 --> 00:40:54.839
that's not stable because you know once
I could cheat on the agreement by

00:40:54.839 --> 00:40:54.849
I could cheat on the agreement by
 

00:40:54.849 --> 00:40:56.279
I could cheat on the agreement by
building up the army and then taking

00:40:56.279 --> 00:40:56.289
building up the army and then taking
 

00:40:56.289 --> 00:40:58.229
building up the army and then taking
over the other side so that's one

00:40:58.229 --> 00:40:58.239
over the other side so that's one
 

00:40:58.239 --> 00:40:59.909
over the other side so that's one
possible outcome but it can also happen

00:40:59.909 --> 00:40:59.919
possible outcome but it can also happen
 

00:40:59.919 --> 00:41:02.449
possible outcome but it can also happen
that there is no stable balance of power

00:41:02.449 --> 00:41:02.459
that there is no stable balance of power
 

00:41:02.459 --> 00:41:05.130
that there is no stable balance of power
and that the amount they because the

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:05.140
and that the amount they because the
 

00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.659
and that the amount they because the
amount they would have to spend on arms

00:41:06.659 --> 00:41:06.669
amount they would have to spend on arms
 

00:41:06.669 --> 00:41:08.370
amount they would have to spend on arms
to deter the other guy from breaking out

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:08.380
to deter the other guy from breaking out
 

00:41:08.380 --> 00:41:11.160
to deter the other guy from breaking out
and attacking is so high that it makes

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:11.170
and attacking is so high that it makes
 

00:41:11.170 --> 00:41:13.410
and attacking is so high that it makes
just too unpleasant and you'd rather

00:41:13.410 --> 00:41:13.420
just too unpleasant and you'd rather
 

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.599
just too unpleasant and you'd rather
it's too expensive you'd rather just

00:41:15.599 --> 00:41:15.609
it's too expensive you'd rather just
 

00:41:15.609 --> 00:41:18.030
it's too expensive you'd rather just
take the chance of fighting a war and

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:18.040
take the chance of fighting a war and
 

00:41:18.040 --> 00:41:19.589
take the chance of fighting a war and
say you know winning even with the

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599
say you know winning even with the
 

00:41:19.599 --> 00:41:22.349
say you know winning even with the
probability of 1/2 after which one side

00:41:22.349 --> 00:41:22.359
probability of 1/2 after which one side
 

00:41:22.359 --> 00:41:24.150
probability of 1/2 after which one side
is eliminated and and this simple

00:41:24.150 --> 00:41:24.160
is eliminated and and this simple
 

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.380
is eliminated and and this simple
two-state world you don't have to spend

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.390
two-state world you don't have to spend
 

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:26.760
two-state world you don't have to spend
anything more on arms if you're the

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:26.770
anything more on arms if you're the
 

00:41:26.770 --> 00:41:28.829
anything more on arms if you're the
winner so you've got kind of get rid of

00:41:28.829 --> 00:41:28.839
winner so you've got kind of get rid of
 

00:41:28.839 --> 00:41:31.079
winner so you've got kind of get rid of
this efficiency inefficiency produced by

00:41:31.079 --> 00:41:31.089
this efficiency inefficiency produced by
 

00:41:31.089 --> 00:41:33.420
this efficiency inefficiency produced by
the arms competition or the need to

00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:33.430
the arms competition or the need to
 

00:41:33.430 --> 00:41:37.650
the arms competition or the need to
balance power so in that case and this

00:41:37.650 --> 00:41:37.660
balance power so in that case and this
 

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:38.940

anarchy it's natural to think in this

00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:44.950
anarchy it's natural to think in this
 

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.079
anarchy it's natural to think in this

ok so what if what determines whether

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:50.740
ok so what if what determines whether
 

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.280
ok so what if what determines whether
you get anarchy or hierarchy well the

00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.290
you get anarchy or hierarchy well the
 

00:41:53.290 --> 00:41:54.930
you get anarchy or hierarchy well the
more the offense defense balance favors

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:54.940

your chance of winning two small changes

00:42:02.549 --> 00:42:02.559
your chance of winning two small changes
 

00:42:02.559 --> 00:42:04.200
your chance of winning two small changes
in your level of arms if that's very

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:04.210
in your level of arms if that's very
 

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.410
in your level of arms if that's very
sensitive then then you know small

00:42:07.410 --> 00:42:07.420
sensitive then then you know small
 

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.000

increases in your armaments giving you

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:09.010
increases in your armaments giving you
 

00:42:09.010 --> 00:42:10.140
increases in your armaments giving you
what the other guys spend and give you a

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:10.150
what the other guys spend and give you a
 

00:42:10.150 --> 00:42:12.089
what the other guys spend and give you a
big bump on your probability of winning

00:42:12.089 --> 00:42:12.099
big bump on your probability of winning
 

00:42:12.099 --> 00:42:14.549
big bump on your probability of winning
that's offensive advantage that's a

00:42:14.549 --> 00:42:14.559
that's offensive advantage that's a
 

00:42:14.559 --> 00:42:16.890
that's offensive advantage that's a
situation in which you're likely to get

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:16.900
situation in which you're likely to get
 

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.569
situation in which you're likely to get
the war outcome rather than be unable to

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:18.579
the war outcome rather than be unable to
 

00:42:18.579 --> 00:42:21.859
the war outcome rather than be unable to
support peace with the balance of power

00:42:21.859 --> 00:42:21.869
support peace with the balance of power
 

00:42:21.869 --> 00:42:24.030
support peace with the balance of power
so the basic lesson here is that

00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:24.040
so the basic lesson here is that
 

00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:26.539
so the basic lesson here is that
offensive advantage makes peace with

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:26.549
offensive advantage makes peace with
 

00:42:26.549 --> 00:42:28.920
offensive advantage makes peace with
deterrence and I'm going to apologize to

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:28.930

which we talked about a lot when we were

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:32.890
which we talked about a lot when we were
 

00:42:32.890 --> 00:42:35.490
which we talked about a lot when we were
when we were in Berkeley years ago and I

00:42:35.490 --> 00:42:35.500
when we were in Berkeley years ago and I
 

00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:37.079
when we were in Berkeley years ago and I
take your point I think you're right

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:37.089
take your point I think you're right
 

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:40.349
take your point I think you're right
about that so let's call it peace with a

00:42:40.349 --> 00:42:40.359
about that so let's call it peace with a
 

00:42:40.359 --> 00:42:42.859
about that so let's call it peace with a
balance of power rather than deterrence

00:42:42.859 --> 00:42:42.869
balance of power rather than deterrence
 

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:46.349
balance of power rather than deterrence
with offensive advantage enough of it

00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359
with offensive advantage enough of it
 

00:42:46.359 --> 00:42:48.930
with offensive advantage enough of it
it's just the piece is too costly and it

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:48.940
it's just the piece is too costly and it
 

00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.000
it's just the piece is too costly and it
breaks down into hierarchy the main

few more people is to great and that's
 

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:13.740

basically an argument saying you have to

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:13.750
basically an argument saying you have to
 

00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:16.170
basically an argument saying you have to
get up to a sufficiently high scale in

01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:45.230
know potentially an argument against
 

01:10:45.230 --> 01:10:46.810
know potentially an argument against
some of the things i've said if for

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:46.820
some of the things i've said if for
 

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.790
some of the things i've said if for
example you get rid imagine getting rid

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800
example you get rid imagine getting rid
 

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.980
example you get rid imagine getting rid
of nuclear weapons and then despite you

01:10:50.980 --> 01:10:50.990
of nuclear weapons and then despite you
 

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:55.710
of nuclear weapons and then despite you
know fairly democratic major powers and

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:55.720
know fairly democratic major powers and
 

01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:59.500
know fairly democratic major powers and
you know nationalism if you know you

01:10:59.500 --> 01:10:59.510
you know nationalism if you know you
 

01:10:59.510 --> 01:11:01.630
you know nationalism if you know you
then would still see like an escalation

01:11:01.630 --> 01:11:01.640
then would still see like an escalation
 

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.930
then would still see like an escalation
of insecurity and and arming and return

01:11:04.930 --> 01:11:04.940
of insecurity and and arming and return
 

01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.490
of insecurity and and arming and return
to alliances then then that would would

01:11:09.490 --> 01:11:09.500
to alliances then then that would would
 

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:12.160
to alliances then then that would would
cut against what i was saying i do wanna

cut against what i was saying i do wanna
 

01:11:12.170 --> 01:11:14.200
cut against what i was saying i do wanna
say about about I don't think nuclear

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:14.210
say about about I don't think nuclear
 

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.580

look at the in the longer term
 

01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:26.930
look at the in the longer term
perspective you take a longer-term

war has been declining for a long time
 

01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:33.410

great power Wars of the scale when they
 

01:11:35.430 --> 01:11:36.800
great power Wars of the scale when they
have occurred you know their intensity

01:11:36.800 --> 01:11:36.810
have occurred you know their intensity
 

01:11:36.810 --> 01:11:39.320

has increased in terms of like number of
 

01:11:39.330 --> 01:11:42.080
has increased in terms of like number of

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:46.470
thought has been in decline since you
 

01:11:46.470 --> 01:11:52.550

know the 1500s and and it's actually

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560
know the 1500s and and it's actually

guess this guy Steven Pinker talks about

01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:57.450
guess this guy Steven Pinker talks about
 

01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:00.380
guess this guy Steven Pinker talks about
this or but but you know various

01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:00.390
this or but but you know various
 

01:12:00.390 --> 01:12:01.820
this or but but you know various
political scientists have seen this in

01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:01.830
political scientists have seen this in
 

01:12:01.830 --> 01:12:04.340
political scientists have seen this in
the data for some time so I think and

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:04.350
the data for some time so I think and
 

01:12:04.350 --> 01:12:06.260
the data for some time so I think and
and so that decline long predates

01:12:06.260 --> 01:12:06.270
and so that decline long predates
 

01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:09.350
and so that decline long predates
nuclear weapons so that so there are

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360
nuclear weapons so that so there are
 

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.300
nuclear weapons so that so there are
some some some longer-term trends that

01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:11.310
some some some longer-term trends that
 

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:12.500
some some some longer-term trends that
are going on and that those are maybe

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:12.510
are going on and that those are maybe
 

01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:14.390
are going on and that those are maybe
the things that I would be trying to

01:12:14.390 --> 01:12:14.400
the things that I would be trying to
 

01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.010
the things that I would be trying to
speak to with these arguments about

01:12:16.010 --> 01:12:16.020
speak to with these arguments about
 

01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:18.440
speak to with these arguments about
democracy and nationalism

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:18.450
democracy and nationalism
 

01:12:18.450 --> 01:12:21.950

Bob's comments so yeah I I think I agree

01:12:21.950 --> 01:12:21.960
Bob's comments so yeah I I think I agree
 

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:23.180
Bob's comments so yeah I I think I agree
with both and this is something I

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:23.190
with both and this is something I
 

01:12:23.190 --> 01:12:27.020
with both and this is something I
haven't got really resolved in thinking

01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:27.030
haven't got really resolved in thinking
 

01:12:27.030 --> 01:12:30.320
haven't got really resolved in thinking
about it yes there is this contradiction

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:30.330
about it yes there is this contradiction
 

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.660
about it yes there is this contradiction
or attention between no cos oh I'm

01:12:32.660 --> 01:12:32.670
or attention between no cos oh I'm

saying that on the one hand conflicting

01:12:33.950 --> 01:12:33.960
saying that on the one hand conflicting
 

01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:36.710
saying that on the one hand conflicting
preferences increased the cost of

01:12:36.710 --> 01:12:36.720
preferences increased the cost of
 

01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:39.050
preferences increased the cost of
anarchy but at the same time they make

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:39.060
anarchy but at the same time they make
 

01:12:39.060 --> 01:12:40.400
anarchy but at the same time they make
it harder to you free for you to

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:40.410
it harder to you free for you to
 

01:12:40.410 --> 01:12:43.730
it harder to you free for you to
construct a you know a governmental

solution to the problem on the other
 

01:12:46.530 --> 01:12:47.600
solution to the problem on the other
hand if you know we get rid of the

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:47.610
hand if you know we get rid of the
 

01:12:47.610 --> 01:12:49.100
hand if you know we get rid of the
conflicting preferences then the chaos

01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:49.110
conflicting preferences then the chaos
 

01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:52.070
conflicting preferences then the chaos
of Anarchy go down the incentive to you

01:12:52.070 --> 01:12:52.080
of Anarchy go down the incentive to you
 

01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:53.270
of Anarchy go down the incentive to you
know the cost of Anarchy or lower

01:12:53.270 --> 01:12:53.280
know the cost of Anarchy or lower
 

01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:54.650
know the cost of Anarchy or lower
there's kind of less lessening and

01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:54.660
there's kind of less lessening and
 

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:57.770
there's kind of less lessening and
lessening you to try to fix the problem

01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780
lessening you to try to fix the problem
 

01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:58.910
lessening you to try to fix the problem
by constructing higher level

01:12:58.910 --> 01:12:58.920
by constructing higher level

institutions so so yes and I don't know

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:02.100
institutions so so yes and I don't know
 

01:13:02.100 --> 01:13:03.650
institutions so so yes and I don't know
about you know curbs going up or down

01:13:03.650 --> 01:13:03.660
about you know curbs going up or down
 

01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.130
about you know curbs going up or down
there I just see it as you know effects

01:13:07.130 --> 01:13:07.140
there I just see it as you know effects
 

01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:09.110

that work in in different directions but

01:13:09.110 --> 01:13:09.120
that work in in different directions but
 

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.790
that work in in different directions but
that generally I guess in both case

01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800
that generally I guess in both case
 

01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:16.010
that generally I guess in both case
cases militate against a world

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:16.020

likewise with democracy yes I think

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:21.450
likewise with democracy yes I think
 

01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:23.490
likewise with democracy yes I think
that's right

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:23.500
that's right

anyway but I think it's also worth
 

01:13:49.360 --> 01:13:51.090
anyway but I think it's also worth
pointing out that if you look at

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:51.100
pointing out that if you look at

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:23.170
certainly true in the European Union and
 

01:14:23.170 --> 01:14:25.979
certainly true in the European Union and
and it's would be true in any kind of

01:14:25.979 --> 01:14:25.989
and it's would be true in any kind of
 

01:14:25.989 --> 01:14:28.140
and it's would be true in any kind of
world government solution I'm sure it's

01:14:28.140 --> 01:14:28.150
world government solution I'm sure it's
 

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:31.140
world government solution I'm sure it's
true in the United Nations just one

01:14:31.140 --> 01:14:31.150
true in the United Nations just one
 

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.520
true in the United Nations just one
minor qualification that point about

minor qualification that point about
 

01:14:32.530 --> 01:14:34.709
minor qualification that point about
nuclear weapons is true on significant

there's been no major award between
 

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:40.470
there's been no major award between
states with nuclear weapons but there

01:14:40.470 --> 01:14:40.480
states with nuclear weapons but there
 

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:43.080
states with nuclear weapons but there
have been too small limited wars between

01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:43.090
have been too small limited wars between
 

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:44.520
have been too small limited wars between

states with nuclear weapons on the
Ussuri 40 odd years ago and in Kargil a

01:14:47.100 --> 01:14:47.110
Ussuri 40 odd years ago and in Kargil a
 

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.330

decade ago on the asuri River and in
 

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:58.550
decade ago on the asuri River and in
Kargil yeah well that's what I said but

01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560
Kargil yeah well that's what I said but
 

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:43.400
Kargil yeah well that's what I said but
qualifications matter next

01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:43.410
 
 

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:46.010
 
we lived in a world with totally

01:15:46.010 --> 01:15:46.020
we lived in a world with totally
 

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:49.130
we lived in a world with totally
completely barriers and meanwhile the

01:15:49.130 --> 01:15:49.140
completely barriers and meanwhile the
 

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:59.180
completely barriers and meanwhile the
key media to everyone's mind

the energy what did you wish you were to
 

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:08.960
the energy what did you wish you were to
somehow create a sense of security the

somehow create a sense of security the

world's assuming you're a leader and
 

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:26.930
world's assuming you're a leader and
sort of well so the answer is is kind of

01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940
sort of well so the answer is is kind of
 

01:16:26.940 --> 01:16:28.310
sort of well so the answer is is kind of
along the lines of how I learned to love

one of the arguments was that you know

01:16:34.850 --> 01:16:34.860
one of the arguments was that you know
 

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:36.830
one of the arguments was that you know
in the current system the cost of an

in the current system the cost of an

not it's really not so bad and I think

not it's really not so bad and I think

not it's really not so bad and I think
to have a view you have to take a long

01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:45.390
to have a view you have to take a long
 

01:16:45.390 --> 01:16:47.300
to have a view you have to take a long
view and think about how bad things were

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:47.310
view and think about how bad things were
 

01:16:47.310 --> 01:16:48.860

agree very much with Ken here that's not

01:16:55.190 --> 01:16:55.200
agree very much with Ken here that's not
 

01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:56.780
agree very much with Ken here that's not
to say that you know nuclear weapons

01:16:56.780 --> 01:16:56.790
to say that you know nuclear weapons
 

01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:59.150
to say that you know nuclear weapons
don't create significant insecurities

01:16:59.150 --> 01:16:59.160
don't create significant insecurities
 

01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.890
don't create significant insecurities
and you know the Dane you know sooner or

01:17:00.890 --> 01:17:00.900
and you know the Dane you know sooner or
 

01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:02.890
and you know the Dane you know sooner or
later one's going to explode and it's

01:17:02.890 --> 01:17:02.900
later one's going to explode and it's
 

01:17:02.900 --> 01:17:05.350
later one's going to explode and it's
you know in a place with a lot of people

01:17:05.350 --> 01:17:05.360
you know in a place with a lot of people
 

01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.550
you know in a place with a lot of people
and this is going to be absolutely awful

01:17:06.550 --> 01:17:06.560
and this is going to be absolutely awful
 

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:10.330
and this is going to be absolutely awful
and so I would like to see clever

01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:10.340
and so I would like to see clever
 

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.100
and so I would like to see clever
thinking about you know here I might

01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:12.110
thinking about you know here I might
 

01:17:12.110 --> 01:17:13.990
thinking about you know here I might
differ well I don't know I don't differ

01:17:13.990 --> 01:17:14.000
differ well I don't know I don't differ
 

01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:17.490
differ well I don't know I don't differ
but clever thinking about international

01:17:17.490 --> 01:17:17.500

kind of direction of centralization in
 

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:30.610
kind of direction of centralization in
that area but you know so I guess I

01:17:30.610 --> 01:17:30.620
that area but you know so I guess I

thank you so much for validating like

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:53.030
thank you so much for validating like

thank you so much for validating like
you a nuclear power I've been published

01:17:55.990 --> 01:17:56.000
you a nuclear power I've been published
 

01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.250
you a nuclear power I've been published
about it and my view is that I want all

01:18:00.250 --> 01:18:00.260
about it and my view is that I want all
 

01:18:00.260 --> 01:18:01.990
about it and my view is that I want all
the nuclear power I can patent and

the nuclear power I can patent and

the nuclear power I can patent and
including area 51 so my question is with

01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:08.420
including area 51 so my question is with
 

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:11.770
including area 51 so my question is with
the idea nuclear power does it make a

01:18:11.770 --> 01:18:11.780
the idea nuclear power does it make a
 

01:18:11.780 --> 01:18:23.470
the idea nuclear power does it make a
lot of sense I would prefer a world very

01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480
lot of sense I would prefer a world very
 

01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.210
lot of sense I would prefer a world very
much in which Iran did not have nuclear

01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:25.220
much in which Iran did not have nuclear
 

01:18:25.220 --> 01:18:30.040
much in which Iran did not have nuclear
weapons but why can I think I see in the

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:30.050
weapons but why can I think I see in the
 

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:32.230
weapons but why can I think I see in the
long run it's it seems to me unlikely

01:18:32.230 --> 01:18:32.240
long run it's it seems to me unlikely
 

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.469
long run it's it seems to me unlikely
that that's a

01:18:34.469 --> 01:18:34.479
that that's a
 

01:18:34.479 --> 01:18:37.830
that that's a
that's a well actually I don't know I

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840
that's a well actually I don't know I
 

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:45.120
that's a well actually I don't know I
mean it is feasible I think that an

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:45.130
mean it is feasible I think that an
 

01:18:45.130 --> 01:18:47.520
mean it is feasible I think that an
attempt to prevent them from acquiring

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:47.530
attempt to prevent them from acquiring
 

01:18:47.530 --> 01:18:50.899
attempt to prevent them from acquiring
nuclear weapons by by military means is

01:18:50.899 --> 01:18:50.909
nuclear weapons by by military means is
 

01:18:50.909 --> 01:18:53.370
nuclear weapons by by military means is
you know in the long run unlikely to be

01:18:53.370 --> 01:18:53.380
you know in the long run unlikely to be
 

01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:56.100
you know in the long run unlikely to be
successful and would kind of guarantee

01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:56.110
successful and would kind of guarantee
 

01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:58.379
successful and would kind of guarantee
that you'd have you know further

01:18:58.379 --> 01:18:58.389
that you'd have you know further
 

01:18:58.389 --> 01:19:00.839
that you'd have you know further
attempts and possibly increases

01:19:00.839 --> 01:19:00.849
attempts and possibly increases
 

01:19:00.849 --> 01:19:03.989
attempts and possibly increases
likelihood of use by Iran in the future

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:03.999
likelihood of use by Iran in the future
 

01:19:03.999 --> 01:19:06.419
likelihood of use by Iran in the future
of nuclear weapons so I think it's a

01:19:06.419 --> 01:19:06.429
of nuclear weapons so I think it's a
 

01:19:06.429 --> 01:19:08.250
of nuclear weapons so I think it's a
difficult problem like I say I'd like to

01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:08.260
difficult problem like I say I'd like to
 

01:19:08.260 --> 01:19:10.640
difficult problem like I say I'd like to
see them not acquire nuclear weapons but

01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:10.650
see them not acquire nuclear weapons but
 

01:19:10.650 --> 01:19:15.919
see them not acquire nuclear weapons but
I don't see yeah I agree with

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:15.929
I don't see yeah I agree with
 

01:19:15.929 --> 01:19:17.729
I don't see yeah I agree with

nuclear power as they've come along and

it's turned out to be less horrific than

it's turned out to be less horrific than
 

01:19:29.130 --> 01:19:31.529
it's turned out to be less horrific than
than expected and I would actually

than expected and I would actually
 

01:19:31.539 --> 01:19:34.739
than expected and I would actually
expect that to be the case here as well

01:19:34.739 --> 01:19:34.749
expect that to be the case here as well
 

01:19:34.749 --> 01:19:37.379
expect that to be the case here as well
but I completely understand being

but I completely understand being

but I completely understand being

question is does it follow from that
 

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.899
question is does it follow from that
that as those things increase we should

it could be a bad thing but if we're

it could be a bad thing but if we're
 

01:26:27.719 --> 01:26:29.150
it could be a bad thing but if we're
talking if you're saying like how could

and it's but my question to you is my
 

01:27:00.210 --> 01:27:01.670
and it's but my question to you is my
understanding is that when we talk about

so in that sense I think there you know
 

01:29:00.330 --> 01:29:02.780
so in that sense I think there you know
there is this common you know there is a

there is this common you know there is a
 

01:29:02.790 --> 01:29:04.340
there is this common you know there is a
kind of clear common interest there and

01:29:04.340 --> 01:29:04.350
kind of clear common interest there and
 

01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:05.810
kind of clear common interest there and

advantage of that control of course and
use it for these other four things that
