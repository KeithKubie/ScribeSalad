00:00:00.866 --> 00:00:02.535
This old world is getting to me.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.540
There's just no trust,
no tegridy,

00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:14.114
so I loaded up the kids,
took my wife by the arm,

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.984
and I moved on out
to a Colorado farm.

00:00:22.355 --> 00:00:25.057
Now it's early to bed,
early to rise.

00:00:25.057 --> 00:00:27.393
The crops are plowed
and it's no surprise.

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.661
City folks are fighting,

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.097
and I don't give a darn,
darn, darn,

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.600
'cause I make my living
on a Colorado farm.

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:40.473
I gotta drive the tractor,
gotta cut the grass.

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:42.942
Chut-chut goes the baler,
like it's never gonna last.

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:44.276
There's food in the kitchen

00:00:44.276 --> 00:00:46.546
and there's bud in the barn,
barn, barn.

00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:49.249
That's life living
on a Colorado farm.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:58.924
Ice cold beer, pickup truck,
country music, listing shit,

00:00:58.924 --> 00:01:00.927
we got Tegridy
to keep us warm.

00:01:03.295 --> 00:01:05.465
That's what you get
on a Colorado farm.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.869
And I'm gonna stay
on a Colorado farm,

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.538
shit.
