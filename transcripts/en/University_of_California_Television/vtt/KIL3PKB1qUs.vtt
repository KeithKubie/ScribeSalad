00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:03.804
(perky synth music)

00:00:34.308 --> 00:00:35.570
- Good afternoon, I'm William Lester,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.560
professor of chemistry
and chair of the Hitchcock

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.180
Professorship Committee.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.760
On behalf of the Hitchcock Professorship,

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.260
we're pleased to welcome Sir John Gurdon

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.500
as this year's speaker in the Charles M.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.610
and Martha Hitchcock Lecture Series.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.770
So John Gurdon's groundbreaking studies

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.830
in nuclear transplantation
galvanized effort

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.970
to clone a mammal from an adult cell,

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.883
a quest that in 1996 produced
a healthy sheep named Dolly.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.270
The intellectual driving
force behind this success

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.210
was Gurdon's discovery
that cells of the body

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.410
are capable of differentiating
into all cell types

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.683
of the vertebrate animal.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:15.720
Gurdon provided unprecedented evidence

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.220
that nuclear transplantations
from specialized cells

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.430
could give rise to adult, fertile

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.463
genetic copies of their donor.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.000
His findings also yielded wide-ranging

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.490
medical implications for the use

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.890
of stem cells in tissue therapy.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.660
Gurdon recently revisited this field

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.420
to study nuclear
reprogramming and cell fate

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.360
determination in amphibians.

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.800
Gurdon was born on October 2nd, 1933,

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.720
in Dippenhall, England, and
entered Christ Church College

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.160
at Oxford University
intending to study Classics.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.500
He transferred to the
Department of Zoology,

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.233
earning his PhD in embryology in 1960.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.500
Following postdoctoral
work at the California

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.460
Institute of Technology,
and a six-month sabbatical

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.990
at the Carnegie Institution in Baltimore,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.240
in 1965 Gurdon returned
to Oxford University.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.860
In 1971 he moved to the
Medical Research Council's

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.750
laboratory of molecular
biology in Cambridge,

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.660
subsequently becoming head
of the Cell Biology Division.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.720
He was appointed professor of cell biology

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.350
in the University of Cambridge in 1983,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.070
and served as master of
Magdalene College Cambridge

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.100
from 1995 to 2002.

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.850
Gurdon is an active researcher
at the Wellcome Trust

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.770
Cancer Research UK Gurdon
Institute of Cancer

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.210
and Developmental Biology,
and served as its first

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.223
chairman from 1988 to 2001.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.070

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.275
Please join me in
welcoming Sir John Gurdon.

00:03:37.275 --> 00:03:39.525
(applause)

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.560
- So, thank you, indeed, Dean
Mason and Professor Lester

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.560
for this most welcome invitation
to give these two talks.

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:11.310
I'm told that one of my
predecessors was someone called

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:16.310
Joseph Needham, and he was a great expert

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:21.990
on Chinese history, and
particularly on Chinese painting,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.300
which in historic times was mostly done

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.900
with a paintbrush,
including their writing.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.550
Joseph Needham enjoyed the reputation

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.140
of a very focused approach to his subjects

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:41.120
and he was well known
to have offered a course

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.520
of five one-hour lectures entitled,

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.313
The History of the Brush.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.670
Now that's a more focused
approach than I planned

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:55.657
to take today and tomorrow,
when I would like to talk

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.340
about the, here we are.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.480
No, we're not; this is, oh, there.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.920
Thank heavens, yes,
I'm so nervous of these

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.740
computer things they may not work.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.920
So I'm going to talk
today about the process

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.730
by which an egg makes an early
embryo and a later embryo,

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:22.730
and finally an adult, and
in the case of mammals,

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:28.120
it's possible to take
these early embryo cells,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.950
place them in culture, and they're called

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.170
embryonic stem cells, implant
them back into an embryo,

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.170
and then grow eventually
an adult, and so one goes

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.840
from an egg, a fertilized
egg, through the early

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.270
developmental stages
so that you end up with

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.860
a range of specialized cells,
such as blood, and skin,

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.740
and these other things
of which we consist.

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.380
Now there are three
approaches that are often used

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:05.300
in this kind of work, which
are aimed at telling us

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:10.300
how early in development
cells actually take decisions.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.160
When do the early embryonic cells decide

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:16.270
what they going to become in development?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.580
And these three approaches
are essentially the following.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.820
One is to take the
early embryo and to mark

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.900
a few of those cells and
simply follow them through

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.050
and ask what they've become.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.653
This is called lineage studies,

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.090
and if you mark cells in
that part of an embryo

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.700
they will become the backbone, sometimes

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:40.880
called notochord, of the embryo.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.310
That's really just to tell
you what the normal history

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.480
of these early cells is.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:53.480
And then the second approach
is often called specification,

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:58.510
where you mark the same
cells, but then you take them

00:06:58.510 --> 00:07:02.450
out of the rest of the embryo,
and grow them in culture,

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:04.500
and ask what they've become.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.350
In many cases, these cells
already know what they're

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:10.950
going to become, and so
they will become backbone,

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.240
often called notochord,
in spite of the fact

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.820
that they have been
taken out of the embryo

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:21.820
and receive no information
from the cells around them.

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:26.330
And then the third approach
is called determination,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.700
where you again mark
these cells at that part

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:33.000
of the embryo, but you
then transplant them

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.470
into another part of another
embryo, a different part,

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:39.760
and if these cells really
know what they're going to be,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.440
if they've made up their mind
to follow a particular fate,

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.040
you will find that these
cells again become backbone

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:51.440
in a secondary embryo already
formed on top of the first.

00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:56.440
Those are the basic procedures
by which one can follow

00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.020
the early decisions that cells take.

00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.230
And one of the lessons
I'm going to talk about is

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.790
the fact that cells take
a very early decision,

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.310
even a few hours after they're formed

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:12.760
as to what they're going to become.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.933
They're very committed
to their future career.

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:21.190
Now, one can demonstrate
this rather easily

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.890
by putting a little
mark on a fertilized egg

00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.620
at one particular point,
actually the point

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.930
just below where a sperm
enters, and when you grow

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:33.100
those eggs into, in this case, tadpoles,

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:35.930
you can barely see it here,
but there is a blue mark

00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:39.500
just under the tail on
each of these larvae.

00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:43.410
It shows that that
particular bit of the egg

00:08:43.410 --> 00:08:47.260
already knows just as a one-cell stage

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.440
what it should become in the rest of life.

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:53.750
This is called the lineage analysis.

00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:57.080
One can actually, interestingly,
follow lineage analysis

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.300
of scientists, and when
you do this you find that

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:04.773
there's a famous early
scientist called Boveri

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:09.860
of whom a student was Spemann,
one of the most famous

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.313
embryologists there are.

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:15.560
Of him, a student was Baltzer.

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:17.680
This is now in Switzerland,
of whom there was

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:21.870
a student called Hadorn,
well known to Drosophila

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.210
embryologists, and so
you go down until you get

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:28.120
to Professor Richard
Harland, who is my host.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.842
Now, whether he knows or not that he was

00:09:30.842 --> 00:09:34.470
a great, great, great,
great scientific grandchild

00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:39.360
of Boveri I'm not quite sure,
but it's an interesting fact

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.730
that a large number,
perhaps even nearly all,

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:48.060
of the European people
in this field trace back

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.850
to one individual, in this case, Boveri.

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:56.850
So that exemplifies the
principle of lineage.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.930
Now what I'm going to do
in this talk is to try

00:10:02.930 --> 00:10:06.080
and cover four points, be
talking a little bit about

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.860
the pre-fertilization
control of development.

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:14.210
Interestingly, an awful lot
of what happens as we form

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:19.210
from an egg takes place
even before fertilization.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.530
I shall then talk a bit
about what we call asymmetric

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.880
cell division, and that's
one of the two fundamental

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.083
mechanisms by which different
kinds of cells are formed.

00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:34.070
The other of these two
mechanisms is called signaling

00:10:34.070 --> 00:10:37.623
between cells, and I shall
talk about that later.

00:10:38.482 --> 00:10:40.250
And then finally something about the

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.360
so-called community effect.

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.340
So that's what I want to talk about.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:50.340
And to start off with in
talking about pre-fertilization

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.280
control of development,
and that really has to do

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.820
with what information exists
in the egg and the sperm

00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:03.740
before they actually meet each other.

00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.270
Now this topic was of interest to people

00:11:06.270 --> 00:11:09.770
a long time ago, and I'm quoting here

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:14.340
from Hartsoeker, 1694,
and as a matter of fact,

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.030
Joseph Needham, to whom I've
referred was a well-known

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.410
historian of embryology.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.470
He shows this picture of
what was seen at the time

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.609
to be a clear view of the sperm,

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:31.360
and if you look carefully
you can see more or less

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.340
a complete adult with
the arms neatly folded

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:39.240
'round the legs of this
individual, which was imagined

00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:41.230
to be present in the sperm.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:46.010
And they thought that's
how people actually arose.

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:50.070
Now that's no longer believed
to be the case once we had

00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:53.333
better microscopes, so things
have moved on from then.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:59.200
But I do want to talk about
a very early experiment

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.780
which is largely overlooked
at the present time,

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:06.100
and this has to do with snails.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.180
Now this diagram looks
complicated, but actually

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.150
it's not actually complicated at all.

00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:17.150
And it relates to the fact
that snails come with a coil.

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.850
And you can call them right-handed snails

00:12:20.850 --> 00:12:22.990
or left-handed snails, depending which,

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:25.880
when you look down from
the top, the spiral

00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.380
goes one way or another.

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:33.380
Now back in the 1920s, people
began investigating this

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:37.450
and they found a rather curious effect,

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.277
that if you cross, this
is a left-handed snail,

00:12:41.277 --> 00:12:43.000
you can barely read the
writing, I'm afraid.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.590
That is a right-handed
snail; you see they coil

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:46.810
different ways.

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.770
When you do that all of the offspring

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.790
actually become left-handed snails,

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:55.470
and when you cross the
two left-handed snails,

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:58.443
all of their offspring
become right-handed snails,

00:12:58.443 --> 00:13:01.740
a very complicated situation.

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.740
But it managed to be interpreted
at that time correctly,

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:11.190
that all that really
matters is the genetic

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:13.670
composition of the mother.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:16.700
So in this case, they call it a small dd

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.480
meaning a sinistral, and when
the mother is of that kind,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.490
all her offspring will
have the left-handed coil

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.803
irrespective of what the
snail's husband might have been.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:33.280
And likewise, in this
case, you have this snail

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.520
which has a genetic constitution
of a right-handedness,

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:41.710
and all their offspring
will be right-handed snails.

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:45.780
And this was worked out
at that time in 1920,

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.750
and it was the very first
example where it was shown

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:55.750
that the mother's constitution
actually determines

00:13:56.330 --> 00:14:00.010
the major characteristics
of all her offspring,

00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:03.917
so there's a maternal
inheritance in this hand,

00:14:03.917 --> 00:14:07.400
in this case, of the
handedness of the individual.

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:09.270
The whole symmetry is changed 'round.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:10.863
Rather a remarkable case.

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.250
Now I quote that for a couple of reasons,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:19.050
and I rather like the original paper

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:21.200
where you couldn't do this nowadays.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.740
They show a picture of the South Yorkshire

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.530
Malacological Society on a Sunday outing

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:33.150
at King Lane Pond, Leeds,
where it so happened

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.913
that these left-handed snails
were extremely abundant.

00:14:37.084 --> 00:14:38.220
They're actually otherwise very rare,

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.420
so this was obviously not
a well-subscribed society

00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.060
where there's as far as I
can see about 10 members

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:48.640
neatly spaced 'round this
small puddle outside Yorkshire.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.210
It's nice that in those days
you could publish a picture

00:14:51.210 --> 00:14:53.710
of that kind of thing in
the middle of your paper.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:56.640
The other thing that's
particularly interesting

00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:01.430
about this particular work
is that one of the people

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:04.580
who did it was a man called Captain Diver,

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:06.800
Captain because he was an army man,

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.140
and he had a career in
the Parliamentary Service,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:12.600
so he worked for six months of the year

00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.440
as an administrator in Parliament
in the government circles,

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.447
and for the other six
months, he grew snails

00:15:19.447 --> 00:15:23.040
in his private house in jam jars.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.700
And he actually did the key experiments

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:28.863
working out how this all happened.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.670
And he actually was an
amateur; he was not trained

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:36.580
as a scientist, and it's
therefore interesting that

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:39.370
one of the fundamental discoveries about

00:15:39.370 --> 00:15:43.830
maternal inheritance was actually achieved

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:48.080
by an amateur who had no
scientific training at all.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.750
And it makes the point
that there is, in fact,

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:53.273
a role for amateur scientists.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:58.930
Now, I'm now going to
turn to the second point,

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.920
part of my talk, and this is the process

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.970
called asymmetric cell division.

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:08.450
We know that people, animals,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:11.970
including ourselves, have three axes.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.350
There's the anterior-posterior axis,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:19.020
and this is largely
determined by your mother,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.490
mother's composition.

00:16:20.490 --> 00:16:23.053
The second axis is the dorsoventral axis,

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:27.410
the back, the front; that,
as we'll see, is largely

00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:31.310
determined most cases by
an environmental influence

00:16:31.310 --> 00:16:33.860
such as where the sperm enters.

00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:36.660
The third axis, the difference
between left and right,

00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.270
is particularly interesting, but actually

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:42.230
we do not still understand the mechanism

00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:47.230
of how a completely
bilaterally symmetrical cell

00:16:47.370 --> 00:16:51.150
can somehow consistently
form two equal cells,

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:55.000
mirror images of each other,
and yet one will always

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.990
be the left-handed side
and the other the right.

00:16:56.990 --> 00:16:58.600
Why is the heart on the left?

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.803
We don't actually
understand that even now.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:07.310
But we do know this principle,
and that's illustrated

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.240
here by looking at cells.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.160
Here's a cell, and it makes some products

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:15.270
which are shown as the
red spots, and usually

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:18.130
these cells have something on one side

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:21.660
like another cell or
membrane, and as a result,

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:25.120
these products go to one side of the cell,

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:27.850
the one distal from that substrate.

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:30.730
And when the cell divides,
most of these products

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.500
go into one daughter cell, not the other.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:36.880
So it's an asymmetric
division, and the one

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:39.510
that gets most of them will then follow

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.480
a differentiated fate,
for example, becoming

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.290
a nerve cell, and the other
one remains as a stem cell,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.090
and later on will divide again to make

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:53.060
another kind of asymmetric division,

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:56.060
that being one important
example of this process.

00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.400
Now the other person who
contributed a great deal

00:17:58.400 --> 00:18:03.050
to this was Conklin; his
early work was actually

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:08.050
about 1905, and he worked
with a marine organism

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:13.170
called Styela, and he established
the important principle

00:18:13.170 --> 00:18:15.790
that this egg has, as
it happens, a little bit

00:18:15.790 --> 00:18:20.070
of yellow pigment, which
when you follow it through,

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:23.930
always ends up in the
tail muscle of the larva.

00:18:23.930 --> 00:18:27.470
So it's a yellow cytoplasm correlates

00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.900
with tail muscle determination.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:33.010
And that was an important
principle established

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:36.403
some hundred years ago
by careful observation,

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.100
and again illustrates
this important principle

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.150
that something is localized
in the very earliest stages

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:48.400
of development which commits
the embryo or organism

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.653
to follow a certain kind of fate.

00:18:53.410 --> 00:18:56.120
Then there are the eggs of amphibians

00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.650
which happen to be conveniently colored,

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:00.960
black on the top and white underneath.

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.130
And a really important work
by one of your colleagues,

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.520
John Gerhart, established some years ago

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.780
that the fundamental
principle here was that

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:15.053
there is a polarity in one direction.

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:17.720
And this is set up maternally.

00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.340
And the sperm generally enters at one side

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:25.440
and opposite it, it
forms a special structure

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:28.080
which this is called a Nieuwkoop center

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:30.680
after one of the famous embryologists,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:33.630
and there's a rotation and at this point,

00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:35.217
the cells start entering the embryo

00:19:35.217 --> 00:19:37.530
and they make the main axis.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:41.030
So this illustrates the
fundamental principle

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:45.860
that you have a maternal
polarity on top of which

00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.120
there is an environmental
polarity, which is

00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.033
at right angles to it, so you
establish the first two axes.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.820
Now mammals like ourselves
are often thought

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:00.270
to be a different principle.

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:03.660
This is a mammal egg and
they're difficult to work with

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.490
because they're extremely small.

00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.750
You may not know that the egg of a mouse,

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:13.680
a human, and an elephant are
all exactly the same size,

00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.980
about 70 microns across,
and it has been thought

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.980
for a long time that these
eggs have no preformed

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:25.440
maternal polarity because
you actually can't see any.

00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:28.720
They look completely even.

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:32.130
But in fact, there are
experiments by my colleague

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.260
Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz, who has done

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.980
some remarkable
experiments with these eggs

00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:40.410
where you divide out the
cells and you collect the ones

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:42.910
that are in a certain position in relation

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.850
to the result of fertilization,
and the main point

00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:50.700
is the green, blue, and red
embryos derived from this

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:52.660
follow completely different fates.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.760
But I show this for another reason

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:59.760
because the manipulations
involved in this process

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:04.900
are actually quite striking,
and we're going to see

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.150
how you have to do these things.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.730
In this case, this is a
very fine micropipette,

00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:13.200
which is going to pick
up a fluorescent bead

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:15.760
and attach it to one point on the embryo.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:18.060
And this is actually mouse
egg, but it would look

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.440
exactly the same if it was a human egg.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.020
This is a pipette which
will pull that cell

00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:27.560
away from the rest of the embryo.

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.560
You see it being dragged away
and a massive distortion,

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.560
but amazingly, the embryos survive.

00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:38.810
This one is actually taking a cell away

00:21:38.810 --> 00:21:42.820
from the rest of the
embryo and you can now see

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:46.600
they focus and prepare to
pull another cell away.

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:49.440
That's one of the
manipulations which can be done

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.820
and could just as well be done with humans

00:21:51.820 --> 00:21:55.730
and indeed, that is the process used

00:21:55.730 --> 00:21:59.890
when you take a cell from
a human embryo, one cell,

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.740
and test it for, say, a genetic disease.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.960
If you're looking for
cystic fibrosis patients,

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:08.250
that's a very good way
of identifying them.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.670
And amazingly, you can pull off one cell

00:22:10.670 --> 00:22:12.720
from the very early
stages, when there are only

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.160
about eight, and the rest
of the embryo survives.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.980
Now what we have not
been able to see so far

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:22.190
is the other video.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:23.190
Yes, this may do it.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:26.887
This is the one I meant to show first.

00:22:26.887 --> 00:22:28.950
The pipette pushes right into that egg.

00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:32.850
It's amazing how it can
tolerate this huge deformation.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:37.250
It's then going to pick up
a fluorescent bead, and now

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.607
you can begin to see these
beads waiting around there.

00:22:41.607 --> 00:22:45.310
And in a moment the pipette,
which is extremely small,

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:47.310
will come along and will pick up

00:22:47.310 --> 00:22:49.570
one of these beads on the tip.

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.640
There you see it now; then it will push

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.020
this again right inside that egg.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.750
It's amazing what these
eggs will tolerate.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.480
There it goes right inside,
about to go right inside,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.840
dig in, completely distort it and leaves

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.580
the bead on the outside.

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.260
And we'll see in a moment that that is,

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.800
since it's marked fluorescently
you will suddenly see

00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.600
this brightly colored fluorescent bead

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.200
sitting on the outside
which enables you to mark

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.980
one particular part of that embryo

00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:21.820
and heads to follow its fate.

00:23:21.820 --> 00:23:23.900
So these are the kinds of things which

00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:27.500
amazingly can be done, I
think with these small eggs,

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.803
extraordinarily tolerant to manipulation.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.263
Now the last example
of asymmetric divisions

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:39.650
is this one with a colleague Andrea Brand

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:43.820
who works with the future nerve cells.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:46.400
The red is the nucleus and the green,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.440
you can see, is a determinant.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.570
It's molecules which actually
tell the daughter cells

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.760
what to become, and in
the video, a brief video

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:57.490
we'll see in a moment,
you'll see that the green

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.430
is all segregated to one
of the two daughter cells.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.210
It all goes to one side.

00:24:03.210 --> 00:24:05.850
Now if you watch quickly the
green has all gone to that side

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.510
and it gets into that
cell, it's very short,

00:24:07.510 --> 00:24:08.490
not the other one.

00:24:08.490 --> 00:24:13.490
So this is a living image of the movement,

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:15.960
the partitioning of that material into one

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:18.110
of the two daughter
cells which then tells it

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:20.490
what it should become.

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:24.070
So the conclusion from
that part of the talk

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:28.480
is simply to say that one of
the fundamental mechanisms

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:33.420
of how we start life as eggs
and turn into individuals

00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.040
is this idea that cells, a parental cell,

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:41.207
puts its key molecules into
one of the two daughter cells

00:24:41.207 --> 00:24:43.440
and that then tells that daughter cell

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.750
what fate it should become.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:47.760
In this case it distinguishes a nerve cell

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.713
from the parental stem cell.

00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:53.740
So now the third part of the talk concerns

00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.570
signaling between cells, and this is

00:24:56.570 --> 00:25:00.690
the second fundamental mechanism by which

00:25:00.690 --> 00:25:03.063
different kinds of cells are formed.

00:25:04.050 --> 00:25:08.870
And the simplest possible
form of this process

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:13.120
is called a simple threshold signaling.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.450
Cells have to be close
together, and the whole process

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.790
is independent of time and concentration.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:22.810
And the principle is this:
that you have a so-called

00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:26.890
responding cell and another
cell that sends out signals,

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.620
and this cell comes adjacent to that one,

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:32.990
sends signals to this
cell, which now follows

00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:36.030
a new cell fate, and it does that because

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.570
it receives signals, signal molecules,

00:25:38.570 --> 00:25:41.610
some of which we know, from a nearby cell.

00:25:41.610 --> 00:25:44.830
A rather simple process,
and it doesn't really matter

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.810
how much information it gets,
as long as it gets enough

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:51.620
that exceeds the threshold,
it will follow this new fate.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:54.870
So that's the simple form of signaling.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:56.900
But there are more complex forms.

00:25:56.900 --> 00:25:59.330
And the one that I'll talk
about for a few minutes

00:25:59.330 --> 00:26:02.530
is the following one, and this is called

00:26:02.530 --> 00:26:06.263
signaling by a morphogen gradient.

00:26:07.350 --> 00:26:09.940
I talked about this in
some detail yesterday

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.330
but I'm going to just summarize
the main principles today.

00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:17.250
And the idea is this: that
you have a part of an embryo

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:19.560
often named after Nieuwkoop or Spemann,

00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.670
the people I mentioned early on,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:25.460
where cells emit a signal,
and the signal they emit,

00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:28.340
these little red spots that
you may just be able to see

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.533
around a cell called A
which is next to the source.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:37.380
In a little bit longer, and
it's typically an hour or two,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.280
more of these signal
molecules have been released

00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.890
and they spread further
away from the source

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:46.000
so as to surround the
second cell in the row,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.030
which now follows fate A, because it gets

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.803
the low concentration of them.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:54.810
And later still, say, three hours later,

00:26:54.810 --> 00:26:57.310
yet more of these
molecules have been formed

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.410
and they now reach the third
cell away from the source,

00:27:00.410 --> 00:27:02.610
which again follows A.

00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.950
Now, the cell that was near the source

00:27:04.950 --> 00:27:08.700
first decides to become A,
and then it changes its mind

00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.870
and decides to become B, and finally

00:27:10.870 --> 00:27:13.380
it may change its mind and become C.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:15.980
And the reason why this
process is so important

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:20.170
is that one signal coming from this center

00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:24.150
can tell several cells
what they should become,

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:27.770
whether they become, say,
nerve or heart or gut

00:27:27.770 --> 00:27:30.310
or anything, and the
position of those cells

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:33.610
is related to where the signal comes from.

00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:38.090
So it's a very fundamental,
important process.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.000
Now much of this work
happens to have been done

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.370
with amphibia, frogs, and it's interesting

00:27:44.370 --> 00:27:47.550
to reflect for a moment
as to why it should be

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.110
or how it came about that
the frog commonly used

00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:54.040
for this work is a South African frog.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.070
And when you go back in
history, you find that

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:59.450
the first description
of this were incorrectly

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:04.110
called Bufo was in 1803
by a French museum worker

00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:07.250
who never saw the animal
alive but he received

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.240
one through the post and
drew a picture of it.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:12.980
And the interesting thing is that the only

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.770
really striking feature of this animal,

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.110
which is called Xenopus
which means strange claws,

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:21.720
is that it should have claws on the feet,

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:23.143
which he failed to observe.

00:28:24.252 --> 00:28:26.740
You'd have thought if
you're given a dead frog

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:28.840
and there's nothing much to look at except

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.187
the fact that it has claws on the feet

00:28:30.187 --> 00:28:33.570
you might actually have noticed
it, but he didn't do that.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:37.500
And that's how it came into
existence, but a bit later

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.840
people wanted to grow
this animal like you do

00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.030
for laboratory animals,
and someone, as it happens,

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:45.710
in Britain then collected some animals

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:47.700
and tried to grow them.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.410
Now, they're tropical animals, and he had

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.540
a publication, the result
of which was to show

00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:55.540
that if you have a
Bunsen burner underneath

00:28:55.540 --> 00:28:59.480
a beaker with water,
you can keep the animals

00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:01.950
inside that container.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:05.470
It's an unbelievably crude
way of keeping animals warm,

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.810
and I think any animal
inspector in Britain, at least,

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.870
would immediately
disallow such a procedure

00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.490
but nevertheless, that's how Mr. Bles came

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:17.720
to add to his publications, by inventing

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:21.613
a not very sophisticated
procedure of keeping animals warm.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.140
Over the years a number of
people have worked on this

00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:28.510
and this is a picture
of a famous embryologist

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:31.650
called Johannes Holtfreter, who was one

00:29:31.650 --> 00:29:34.103
of the students of Spemann.

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:40.540
Spemann was a very austere
person with a rigid personality

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:45.490
and Holtfreter was a
rather lively student who

00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:48.330
was actually very famous
because he discovered

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.590
a way of preventing nearly all the embryos

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:52.950
that Spemann worked with from dying.

00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:57.160
So Spemann's famous experiment
which got him a Nobel Prize

00:29:57.160 --> 00:30:00.550
was to graft tissue from
one embryo to another.

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.000
Very elegant experiment but the fact is

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.450
that almost all the embryos died.

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:08.500
I think three out of 150 showed the effect

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.380
for which the Nobel Prize was awarded,

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:13.730
the other 147 having died.

00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:16.500
The reason they died was
that they got infected.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:19.570
Now, Holtfreter was
clever enough to think of

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:22.210
making a solution
actually out of chemicals

00:30:22.210 --> 00:30:24.633
from the shelf so there
weren't bacteria in it,

00:30:25.482 --> 00:30:27.120
but he had a lively personality and much

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.830
of his time was spent
painting in Indonesia,

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:31.780
which was his hobby.

00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:36.510
That infuriated Spemann and
so he disliked Holtfreter

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:39.880
and all his work, but
nevertheless, that's who he was

00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:43.070
and he was really very
fundamentally enabling

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.580
much of the experimental
embryology now done today

00:30:47.477 --> 00:30:50.110
to actually take place.

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:53.880
Now using these sorts of
methods one can explore

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.960
how cells signal to each other, and one

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:59.910
of the crucial methods
now is to take an embryo,

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:03.320
separate all the cells in suspension,

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.480
add to them some of these
known growth factors,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.090
and there's one that
happens to be called activin

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:12.427
for only 10 minutes, so
you influence the cells,

00:31:12.427 --> 00:31:16.660
and then you wash off
all the excess factor

00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.547
and put them together and grow them.

00:31:18.547 --> 00:31:21.810
And that's turned out to
be a very informative way

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:26.810
of establishing how
cells respond to signals.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.970
One of the remarkable things now is that

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.520
one particular molecule, a
member of the TGF-beta class,

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.700
can be used to treat these
embryo cells in suspension.

00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:44.780
And rather surprisingly you
can make almost every cell

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:49.380
in the body just by
treating these embryo cells

00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.450
for a few minutes with
different concentrations

00:31:52.450 --> 00:31:53.730
of this factor.

00:31:53.730 --> 00:31:58.730
So if you use a low
concentration, middle, high,

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:04.360
or very high, you send cells
in different directions,

00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:07.210
various genes are turned on,
and you can see that you end up

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:10.410
with blood, muscle,
cartilage, or intestine.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:12.830
And that's a very important point

00:32:13.770 --> 00:32:18.110
that by taking very early, naive cells,

00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:19.550
and they really are very early,

00:32:19.550 --> 00:32:22.960
you can give them different
amounts of the same substance

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:26.820
and tell them to form
totally different structures

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.700
which are the main components of our body.

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:33.090
And this point will be
quite relevant when I talk

00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:37.240
about the second part of
this process tomorrow.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:40.560
But it does raise the
question of how it is

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:45.010
that a cell can perceive or interpret

00:32:45.010 --> 00:32:48.090
these different concentrations of factor.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.320
And the concentrations are extremely small

00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:54.080
and only two- or threefold
changes in concentration

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.010
will make the difference
between, for example,

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.093
heart or intestine, or bone, or blood.

00:33:02.450 --> 00:33:07.250
We can see this process
working in this example

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.760
where these are beads, biochemical beads,

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.880
treated with the factor,
and they cause genes

00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:15.670
to be turned on in this group of cells,

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.980
and when you increase the concentration

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:21.420
this gene response is
further away from the source.

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:24.450
So the strength of this signal will decide

00:33:24.450 --> 00:33:27.330
how far away this response occurs,

00:33:27.330 --> 00:33:30.050
very much like dropping or
throwing a stone into a pond.

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.980
There's a ripple of gene
response among these cells

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:37.150
and if you do it even stronger, the ripple

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.730
reaches the edge, as it were, of the pond.

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.640
And the point of saying
this is that the same cells

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.940
will respond in completely different ways

00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:51.920
to the same purified biochemical
factor, same molecule.

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:55.550
It gives us a lot of
opportunity for determining

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:58.650
the way embryo cells
will develop and making

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.543
the kind of cells we
might wish them to form.

00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:06.780
One of the principles here
is that these determinants,

00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:11.780
these factors shown as blue
spots, move away from the source

00:34:13.146 --> 00:34:15.440
in the space in between cells.

00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:18.030
They bind to the matrix
with very low affinity

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:20.200
and occasionally they find a receptor

00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:23.260
here on the cells to which
they bind very tightly

00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:28.260
and will inform cells of the
fate that they should follow.

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.770
Now this is again a
rather remarkable process

00:34:35.770 --> 00:34:37.890
which I'm going to explain
in a little more detail

00:34:37.890 --> 00:34:40.010
by the use of, hopefully, a video.

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:44.270
If you take these cells, and
this is just one sort of cell,

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:48.530
and you treat them by adding this factor,

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:52.850
this TGF-beta molecule called
activin, for only 10 minutes,

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:57.210
you find that the molecule
in the cell which signals

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.240
to the genes to tell it
what it is, called Smad2,

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.170
goes into the nucleus,
and that green patch

00:35:03.170 --> 00:35:07.440
is the presence of these
molecules inside this cell.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:10.800
Now you notice that, for
only a 10-minute treatment,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.100
the green molecules move
in, and there they still are

00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.600
inside this cell as much as
four or five hours later.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.340
And it turns out that these
cells remember, curiously,

00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:26.500
the small amount of treatment they've had,

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:30.610
and they will follow a
fate, whether it's heart

00:35:30.610 --> 00:35:33.030
or liver, or whatever else it is,

00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:38.030
simply according to the
strength of that signal

00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:40.180
that they received for 10 minutes.

00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:43.380
So enhancing a point I've just made,

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.570
you can take these single cells, give them

00:35:46.570 --> 00:35:49.970
a very short treatment
of some known factor.

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:53.010
The factor actually is a
gene product now purified.

00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:56.263
And that very short experience of only

00:35:56.263 --> 00:35:59.080
a 10-minute treatment will tell the cells

00:35:59.080 --> 00:36:01.913
what kind of fate they should follow.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.663
And this is the process called memory.

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:12.020
And when you integrate this information

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.690
the way it seems to work is the following:

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:18.690
that these cells receive this
signal and they absorb it,

00:36:18.930 --> 00:36:22.550
and they start responding
to gene A, B, or C

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.130
according to the strength.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:28.580
They then will remain at
that level of response,

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.310
to what the level line
means, until finally

00:36:31.310 --> 00:36:34.203
they won't receive the signal anymore.

00:36:34.203 --> 00:36:37.860
They become noncompetent; they
just won't receive it anymore

00:36:37.860 --> 00:36:39.540
and the signal goes down.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:44.360
Now they have to remain
expressing a constant response

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:47.320
for some time to make
enough of the product

00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:49.470
to guide the cells in the directions

00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:52.113
they eventually need to go.

00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:56.500
I'm now going to try and explain how it is

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.610
that this whole process works.

00:36:58.610 --> 00:37:01.263
And there's one
fundamental principle here,

00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:05.570
and that is that what really matters

00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:09.600
is the concentration of this signal factor

00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:12.890
inside the nucleus of the cell,

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:17.890
and it actually is the
volume of that material

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.690
which is passing within
the cell to the genes.

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:25.560
And I show these two pictures because they

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:30.560
illustrate the point that
the flow rate of something,

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.283
the rate of flow is not
relevant here at all;

00:37:34.283 --> 00:37:35.720
it's the volume.

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:39.900
Now this rather splendid
picture of the Victoria

00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:41.363
waterfalls coming from there,

00:37:41.363 --> 00:37:46.363
there's a substantial distance
that the water is falling,

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.950
and of course the rate
at which that water falls

00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:54.490
will be more or less
proportional to the height.

00:37:54.490 --> 00:37:57.620
There's a certain rate of
flow, but in this case,

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.763
the source is very small.

00:38:00.632 --> 00:38:02.680
There's a little stream
there, and it will follow down

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:05.360
and the volume, though
it looks considerable

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:07.613
from this picture, is
actually quite limited.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.530
Now if we compare that
waterfall to another one

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.250
equally famous that you may have seen

00:38:14.250 --> 00:38:19.136
called the IguazÃº Falls
on the border of Paraguay

00:38:19.136 --> 00:38:23.070
and Uruguay and, I think, Brazil,

00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:26.370
the distance is the same,
the height is the same,

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:28.590
but the volume of water
is absolutely immense.

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.140
It kind of falls right
across that whole hillside

00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.160
and indeed 'round the corner.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.160
And it is the volume of flow that makes

00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:40.930
the difference in cells.

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:45.070
And, indeed, these two
examples, which show

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:46.990
the cells follow a
completely different fate

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.220
according to the volume of flow,

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.830
not the rate of flow or anything else.

00:38:51.830 --> 00:38:55.000
Now I have a video which
explains this clearly,

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.700
if the video shows, and it's going

00:38:56.700 --> 00:38:59.560
to work the following way:

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:03.440
We have outside the
cell these green objects

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.930
which are the signal
factors coming from a source

00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:08.300
and you'll see them coming from this side

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:12.160
and moving across, and as they move,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:16.050
they have some chance of some
of them finding a receptor.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.360
This is what they have to find.

00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:21.470
When they do find that,
the red signal molecule,

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.010
the one that was shown
as bright green before,

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:29.010
goes into the nucleus where
it forms a concentration

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:32.470
which is sufficient to turn
on the appropriate gene,

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.040
in this case, A.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.490
In order to keep this working smoothly,

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.050
something or other has
to come along and remove

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:41.810
all those molecules from outside the cell.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:44.060
There is a point in
showing these butterflies,

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:46.540
which you may wonder
why they're being shown.

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:49.720
And the point of doing
so is that this concept

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.940
of a morphogen gradient concentration,

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.860
and this actually applies fairly widely.

00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.520
Now you may be able to
see perhaps that these

00:39:57.520 --> 00:40:00.040
rather splendid undersides of butterflies

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.920
have these brilliant ring
spots with many ripples

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.030
of colors in this particular species.

00:40:05.030 --> 00:40:07.720
And the Femme Fatale is
a great expert on this

00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:11.550
but it seems almost certainly
that this coloration

00:40:11.550 --> 00:40:14.380
in butterflies, fish, birds, works

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:17.980
by a morphogen gradient
process by which cells

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.770
sense a wave of molecules going past them

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.800
and switch on genes accordingly.

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.673
And I draw this one because to me this is

00:40:25.673 --> 00:40:27.720
a really interesting
problem in the future.

00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:30.750
One is to understand how could these

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.440
complicated patterns arise with a source?

00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:36.820
But another butterfly,
this one, has the top side

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.440
completely black, and the other side

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.720
of the same butterfly has
this almost straight line

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.020
straight down the middle.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:45.110
And to me it's almost inexplicable how

00:40:45.110 --> 00:40:49.640
a mechanism that can produce
ripples of concentration there

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:52.060
can produce an almost ruled straight line

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.580
down the other side.

00:40:53.580 --> 00:40:57.840
It must have something
to do with the diffusion

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:02.110
of molecules, but
curiously it's a completely

00:41:02.110 --> 00:41:03.513
non-understood phenomenon.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:07.940
So the last few minutes,
what I'll talk about now

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:09.567
is the remaining point, and this is

00:41:09.567 --> 00:41:12.400
the so-called community effect.

00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:16.000
And the principle of this
idea is the following:

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.910
that we've talked about
cells that receive signals

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.170
as they come from one direction.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:26.270
But it turns out that another
mechanism of signaling

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:30.930
is one where cells
receive an initial signal

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:35.380
of one kind to get them
going at a low level.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.170
And then what they do is
to signal to themselves

00:41:40.219 --> 00:41:43.600
and enhance the response, so it's as if

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.090
various of you received some indication

00:41:46.090 --> 00:41:47.330
that there was something happening

00:41:47.330 --> 00:41:48.780
and then once you've got that signal

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:51.240
you all had to put your hands up and show

00:41:51.240 --> 00:41:53.720
your neighbors that you've got the signal

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:56.740
and that constitutes a
message to all your neighbors

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.610
that they must now respond
in a particular way.

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.770
So the idea is this:
that these two pink cells

00:42:02.770 --> 00:42:07.150
have received a signal,
and they've just started

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.000
following the muscle
pathway, like hard muscle,

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.380
but they're only pink
because the concentration

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.170
of black spots is very low.

00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:18.470
Now if all of these cells
in a group were to emit

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.920
the same black spots, but
they're next to each other,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:24.130
the concentration of those black spots

00:42:24.130 --> 00:42:27.210
is now enormously higher simply because

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.060
they are next to each
other and they build up

00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:31.410
this concentration, and when that happens,

00:42:31.410 --> 00:42:35.690
the whole group collectively
will then switch

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:38.600
and progress to another
kind of differentiation;

00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:41.000
in this particular case it's muscle.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.090
Now in this case you
really can't see anything.

00:42:44.090 --> 00:42:46.370
And I can see quite well on
the screen but you can't.

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:49.380
There are single cells which
are essentially invisible

00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:53.010
and they are sitting alone
without any neighbors.

00:42:53.010 --> 00:42:56.730
And when you look at that
there is no response.

00:42:56.730 --> 00:42:58.710
Had there been a response
there'd be black spots

00:42:58.710 --> 00:43:00.910
showing a gene response.

00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:02.860
Now when you have a lot
of these cells together

00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:05.650
and here is about 100 of them in a group,

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:08.000
they're all marked with
a lineage marker, red,

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.650
and when you look for the
response, here are the black spots

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.460
so all of those cells
have turned on a gene,

00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:16.750
the muscle gene, only
because they were present

00:43:16.750 --> 00:43:19.750
in this large community together.

00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:24.750
So that is the concept
of a community effect,

00:43:25.350 --> 00:43:28.930
and it does matter, so
that when they signal

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.940
to each other you get
something like a 10-fold

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.463
increase in the response.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:38.220
Now I'll now show another picture,

00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:43.220
and this is a fiendish fish,
you may be able to see,

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.740
which lives in the deep water, and it has

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:50.560
a light organ, here, it
has this sort of projection

00:43:50.560 --> 00:43:52.740
which is very brightly colored.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.650
In fact, it emits light.

00:43:54.650 --> 00:43:59.650
And what happens is that
the light attracts prey

00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:04.250
which this fiendish
animal then gobbles up.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:06.240
Now, what is the relevance?

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.220
It turns out that this process has a name

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:13.640
called quorum sensing;
it means that the quorum,

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:17.980
enough of them working
together produce a result.

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:20.380
And the explanation for
this is the following:

00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:25.050
that in that light
organ, there are bacteria

00:44:25.050 --> 00:44:27.050
and they live there, and the bacteria

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:32.050
cause the turning on of a gene
that emits light, Lux gene.

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.730
The interesting thing
is, for that to happen,

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:40.200
you need to have an
exceptionally high concentration

00:44:40.200 --> 00:44:42.810
of these bacteria, something like

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:44.940
a thousand million per mil.

00:44:44.940 --> 00:44:47.830
Whereas when there's a
much lower concentration,

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:50.430
a few hundred per mil,
that is insufficient

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.640
to activate the bacteria
to turn on the gene.

00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.960
And they even know the
name of the chemical,

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.410
which is called homoserine lactone.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.570
And the principle here
is that the concentration

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:06.420
of bacteria in that space
signal to each other

00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:09.520
to then cause the turning on of this gene,

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.430
which only happens when
there are enough of them

00:45:12.430 --> 00:45:15.880
actually working together, so what we call

00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:20.140
the community effect in
development and creating

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.600
cells like, organs like
the heart and muscle

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.500
depends on this community effect.

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:29.250
And unknown to me at the
time when we worked that out,

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.260
the bacteriologist had
worked out this process

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.700
of the homoserine lactone
working for quorum sensing.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:41.700
So the concept here is a
fairly general one in science

00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:47.260
and it makes the point that
for cells to actually follow

00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.290
a particular fate, you
need the combination

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:51.860
of the two processes.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:56.070
So here is a diagram to
indicate that if you have.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:57.970
I can barely read it at the top,

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:00.070
you have a concentration of this factor

00:46:00.070 --> 00:46:02.350
which I've been talking
about called activin

00:46:02.350 --> 00:46:06.403
ranging from about three
to 10 to 30 picoMolar,

00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:10.190
different three times-fold concentrations,

00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:11.730
only threefold changes.

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:15.690
At this concentration followed
by the community effect

00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:19.457
all of those cells now
switch on a gene called MyoD

00:46:19.457 --> 00:46:21.700
and that's shown as a black spot.

00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.840
And likewise they'll
turn on cardiac actin,

00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.210
the muscle actin at that concentration.

00:46:26.210 --> 00:46:31.210
But if you start them off at
a higher concentration here

00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.550
only threefold different,
then when they communicate

00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:37.720
with each other, they will then turn on

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.340
the gut gene, the endodermin gene.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.810
So it means that the principle is that

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.850
it's the combination of
a signal from some source

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:49.000
going through like a morphogen action

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.860
and then being amplified by the cells

00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:54.900
that receive that signal,
then signaling again

00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:58.730
to themselves to enhance
the original effect.

00:46:58.730 --> 00:47:01.800
And you end up in this way with organs

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:04.010
like we have the heart and so on.

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:08.573
But it does depend on this
sequential kind of signaling.

00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:13.180
So now let me first summarize
what I've said at some length.

00:47:13.180 --> 00:47:15.610
And then finally I'll
give you a bottom line.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:18.330
So I'm going to have to read this

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:19.570
'cause that light's in the way.

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:22.320
What it says is, reading from the top:

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:26.590
An embryo is usually formed
by a maternally created

00:47:26.590 --> 00:47:29.660
first axis, the mother
fixes that, followed

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.770
by an environmentally induced second axis

00:47:32.770 --> 00:47:34.810
such as sperm entry.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:38.800
And the second point is that
cells, tissues, and organs

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:43.230
are formed by a combination
of first, the asymmetric

00:47:43.230 --> 00:47:46.530
distribution of determinants
at cell division,

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:51.060
and secondly, by signals from other cells.

00:47:51.060 --> 00:47:53.430
The morphogen gradient interpretation

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:57.170
is an important mechanism for activating

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:59.820
gene expression in the correct position.

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:03.440
And lastly, the community effect converts

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:07.140
gene expression into final cell types.

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.220
Now you'll probably say
or people may say to you,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:14.710
what did the man say in
this 45 minutes of lecture,

00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:16.120
and they always expect a bottom line.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.690
So I'm giving you a bottom
line in case you have

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:20.790
no idea what I've talked about at all.

00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:23.307
And so what this, this is ...
(audience laughs)

00:48:23.307 --> 00:48:24.560
... a bottom line.

00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:27.900
It's a Biblical statement
you may recognize.

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.560
It says, Faith, hope, and charity,

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.410
and the greatest of these is charity.

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.650
Now, the embryologist
would say, Space, time,

00:48:37.650 --> 00:48:41.030
and concentration, and
the greatest of these

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:42.260
is concentration.

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:44.568
So the bottom line is concentration.

00:48:44.568 --> 00:48:45.490
(audience laughs)

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:47.640
And finally, let me
just say that the people

00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:51.360
whose work I've referred
to, colleagues Steven Dyson,

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.052
Pierre-Yves Bourillot, Jerome Jullien,

00:48:54.052 --> 00:48:57.240
and I've been kindly given
videos by my colleagues

00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:59.780
Andrea Brand and Magdalena Zernicka-Goetz,

00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.410
and we're supported by the Wellcome Trust.

00:49:01.410 --> 00:49:02.475
Thank you.

00:49:02.475 --> 00:49:04.725
(applause)

00:49:12.532 --> 00:49:15.080
- [Man With Snail Question]
You had the snails up there,

00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:20.080
and you had those four
rows, or four levels.

00:49:23.522 --> 00:49:27.340
The second-to-last level
was all sinistral, dextral,

00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:31.150
I don't remember which,
and then the last one,

00:49:31.150 --> 00:49:34.520
it was made up of recessive-recessive,

00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.357
recessive-dominant, dominant-recessive,

00:49:36.357 --> 00:49:40.090
and dominant-dominant,
they had the direction.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:43.240
But you explained that
all the way down but

00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.090
if you explained it, I didn't get it.

00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:51.180
The last line there, when
they're heterogeneous,

00:49:51.180 --> 00:49:56.180
but they're mixed with
the big Ds and the small.

00:49:56.410 --> 00:50:01.410
The last line on that slide,
are you following this?

00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.100
- I think I can; let me try
to contribute to your point.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:10.330
It did look a rather
forbiddingly complicated picture

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:15.240
but the basic principle
was this: that the genetic

00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:20.230
constitution of the mother,
which is variably described

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:25.230
as little dd or big
D-little d, or big D-big D,

00:50:25.750 --> 00:50:29.340
determines the dextrality,
D stands for dextrality,

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:33.760
so the principle is that if
it's a capital D-capital D,

00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:36.010
that's for dextral.

00:50:36.010 --> 00:50:38.590
It's a dominant gene, so
if it's big D-little d,

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.710
that also means dextral.

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:44.010
Only if it's a little d-little
d, the double recessive,

00:50:44.010 --> 00:50:45.760
does that make it sinistral.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.590
And the point of the diagram was that

00:50:48.590 --> 00:50:53.590
the only thing that actually
decides the coiling,

00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:58.820
or the shell pattern of the offspring,

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.840
is the genetic constitution of the mother,

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:04.660
not the genetic constitution
of the snail itself.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.110
That was the complication,
because normally

00:51:07.110 --> 00:51:10.950
we think that if we have
genes of a certain kind,

00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:12.700
that will determine what
we are, and that is,

00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.440
indeed, the normal situation.

00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.420
But it was very confusing,
the time that this

00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:21.710
absolutely didn't apply;
it only depended on

00:51:22.685 --> 00:51:24.460
the genetic constitution of the mother,

00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:28.250
not of the mother and
father as it would with us.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:32.360
And I might add that the case
was even more complicated

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:35.600
because they chose to do
experiments with snails

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:38.140
which have the extraordinary disadvantage

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.280
of being prepared, one snail would mate

00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:42.880
with another snail but, amazingly enough,

00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:45.260
the snail will self-fertilize itself,

00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:47.440
so it mates with itself
when it feels like it.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.190
So that is
(audience laughs)

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:51.227
quite extraordinarily confusing.

00:51:51.227 --> 00:51:53.150
- [Man With Snail Question]
Hermaphroditic, yeah.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:54.580
- If you were designing this experiment

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.560
you would never, ever start with snails

00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.890
that can self-fertilize
or cross-fertilize,

00:51:59.890 --> 00:52:01.930
and indeed, no one's ever done experiments

00:52:01.930 --> 00:52:03.725
with snails again as far as I know

00:52:03.725 --> 00:52:06.320
(audience laughs)
and for a very good reason.

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.700
So if you imagine it,
and you didn't understand

00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:11.540
anything about maternal inheritance,

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:15.450
it's really quite amazing
that this was worked out.

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.800
So the basic principle is
that once you understand

00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:21.180
that the only thing that matters here

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:24.020
is the genetic constitution
of your mother,

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:25.590
and your father's completely irrelevant,

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:27.214
then the whole thing makes sense.

00:52:27.214 --> 00:52:29.080
- [Man With Snail Question]
But didn't your last line

00:52:29.080 --> 00:52:31.710
have them all in the same direction?

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:33.367
- Yeah, they were all right-handed.

00:52:33.367 --> 00:52:34.860
- [Man With Snail Question]
But it was the opposite

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.240
of the previous line,
the opposite of the line

00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:40.520
of mother, of all that generation.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.567
- They were all dextral, right-handed.

00:52:43.567 --> 00:52:44.400
- [Man With Snail Question]
And the ones above

00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.687
were all sinistral?

00:52:47.534 --> 00:52:51.390
- The dextrals all came from a mother

00:52:51.390 --> 00:52:53.520
which was, herself, sinistral, but had the

00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.650
genetic constitution of being right-handed

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.760
so she became sinistral because her mother

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:03.470
had that constitution,
and she as a daughter

00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:05.910
then got a right-handed
constitution to ensure

00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:08.513
that all her progeny
were right-handed snails.

00:53:10.565 --> 00:53:12.340
- [Man With Snail Question]
It's constitutional ...

00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:14.150
- I didn't invent the way snails work,

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.787
but that's how it is, actually.

00:53:17.772 --> 00:53:20.022
(applause)

00:53:21.142 --> 00:53:24.142
(perky synth music)
