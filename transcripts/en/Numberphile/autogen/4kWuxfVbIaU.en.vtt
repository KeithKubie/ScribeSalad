works just like the seal bid that we
 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.159
works just like the seal bid that we
described before but now when we open

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:57.169
described before but now when we open
 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:05:59.020

the envelopes the high bidder will win

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030
the envelopes the high bidder will win
 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.899
the envelopes the high bidder will win
but they pay the second highest bid not

00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:01.909
but they pay the second highest bid not
 

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:04.119
but they pay the second highest bid not
the highest bid it's the minimum they

00:06:04.119 --> 00:06:04.129
the highest bid it's the minimum they
 

00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:06.249
the highest bid it's the minimum they
could have been and still won there's

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259
could have been and still won there's
 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:07.689
could have been and still won there's
one way to think about it this is the

00:06:07.689 --> 00:06:07.699
one way to think about it this is the
 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:09.100
one way to think about it this is the
price of that had they known what all

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.110
price of that had they known what all
 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.390
price of that had they known what all
the other bids were this is what they

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:10.400
the other bids were this is what they
 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.279
the other bids were this is what they
would have wanted to bid is that maybe

you wouldn't expect it to be a lot more

and in fact the mathematics of it
 

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:17.990
and in fact the mathematics of it
suggests you would you would expect less

00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000

not at all in fact you might have even
 

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:35.809
not at all in fact you might have even
gotten less what's your advice to

00:12:35.809 --> 00:12:35.819
gotten less what's your advice to
 

00:12:35.819 --> 00:12:38.179

most things that sell on eBay there's
 

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:41.960
most things that sell on eBay there's
more than one copy of it so that is to

00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:41.970
more than one copy of it so that is to
 

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:44.030
more than one copy of it so that is to
say you there are multiple copies of it

00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040
say you there are multiple copies of it
 

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.400
say you there are multiple copies of it
and so the hard problem on eBay

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:46.410
and so the hard problem on eBay
 

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:49.340
and so the hard problem on eBay
is not so much what to bid on the item

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:49.350
is not so much what to bid on the item
 

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:52.249
is not so much what to bid on the item
but which auction to bid in so my first

doesn't really make this all that easy
to know what what things sell for track

00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:06.509
to know what what things sell for track
 

00:13:06.509 --> 00:13:08.780
to know what what things sell for track
how much it sells for in different

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:08.790
how much it sells for in different
 

00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:10.879
how much it sells for in different
auctions and that gives you a well if

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:10.889
auctions and that gives you a well if
 

00:13:10.889 --> 00:13:12.590
auctions and that gives you a well if
I'm willing to wait six weeks here's

00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600
I'm willing to wait six weeks here's
 

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.059
I'm willing to wait six weeks here's
what I expect to pay if I'm willing to

00:13:14.059 --> 00:13:14.069
what I expect to pay if I'm willing to
 

00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:16.040
what I expect to pay if I'm willing to
wait three months I will expect to pay

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:16.050
wait three months I will expect to pay
 

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:17.870
wait three months I will expect to pay
less I'll see an auction that shows up

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:17.880
less I'll see an auction that shows up
 

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.540
less I'll see an auction that shows up
with a lower price and so that gives you

00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:20.550
with a lower price and so that gives you
 

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.850
with a lower price and so that gives you
information that arms you about what to

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:22.860
information that arms you about what to
 

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:27.199
information that arms you about what to
bid and then secure our submitted in one

00:13:27.199 --> 00:13:27.209
bid and then secure our submitted in one
 

00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:29.240
bid and then secure our submitted in one
auction as soon as it gets be Co

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.250
auction as soon as it gets be Co
 

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:32.179
auction as soon as it gets be Co
submitted in another auction as soon as

00:13:32.179 --> 00:13:32.189
submitted in another auction as soon as
 

00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:34.040
submitted in another auction as soon as
that gets beat go submit it in a third

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:34.050
that gets beat go submit it in a third
 

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:36.710
that gets beat go submit it in a third
auction and so on when you do this you

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720
auction and so on when you do this you
 

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.269
auction and so on when you do this you
should favor auctions that are about to

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:38.279
should favor auctions that are about to
 

00:13:38.279 --> 00:13:40.429
should favor auctions that are about to
expire why because that way you get the

00:13:40.429 --> 00:13:40.439
expire why because that way you get the
 

00:13:40.439 --> 00:13:42.170
expire why because that way you get the
information earlier about whether you're

00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180
information earlier about whether you're
 

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:43.579
information earlier about whether you're
going to get beat so you're kind of

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:43.589
going to get beat so you're kind of
 

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:45.620
going to get beat so you're kind of
running what we call a search algorithm

00:13:45.620 --> 00:13:45.630
running what we call a search algorithm
 

00:13:45.630 --> 00:13:47.810
running what we call a search algorithm
trying to find which auction is going to

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:47.820
trying to find which auction is going to
 

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.060
trying to find which auction is going to
get the item to sell at that low price

00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:50.070
get the item to sell at that low price
 

00:13:50.070 --> 00:13:52.040
get the item to sell at that low price
this obviously only applies for items

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:52.050
this obviously only applies for items
 

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.470
this obviously only applies for items
that are where there's more than one

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.480
that are where there's more than one
 

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.120
that are where there's more than one
item but that is the bulk of the things
