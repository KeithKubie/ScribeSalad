00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:03.080
Okay. Before we get in too much further into this, we should actually

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.615
talk about what we're doing so this class is going to have two lessons.

00:00:05.615 --> 00:00:06.590
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:09.880
&gt;&gt; Lesson one is on HTML and CSS, which are basically, how

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.050
does this webpage work or how does it look, I should say.

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.910
&gt;&gt; Yeah and then, lesson two will be on

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.780
the JavaScript, which is sort of more how, how

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.520
it works, how, the elements on the page are

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.170
controlled, how, things change when you interact with the page.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.660
&gt;&gt; Right and

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.840
so if you're an experienced programmer with a

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.920
decent amount of experience who doesn't wan to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.500
learn the basics of HTML and CSS, you can go ahead and skip to, lesson two.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.770
&gt;&gt; But it would still be super valuable to have you in

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.140
the forums, since the new programmers

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.050
will definitely benefit from your knowledge.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.280
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Nothing like having some experienced help

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.790
around, like Sarah, to help you in programming.
