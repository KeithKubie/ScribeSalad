00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:03.875
- [Voiceover] If the trip
home takes 39 minutes

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.115
at what time does Chris have to leave

00:00:06.115 --> 00:00:10.153
in order to be home by
a quarter after six?

00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:12.702
A quarter after six.

00:00:12.727 --> 00:00:15.433
So let's draw a timeline
and then think about

00:00:15.458 --> 00:00:17.091
what has to happen here.

00:00:17.116 --> 00:00:18.696
This is at least how
I need to visualize it

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:20.356
in order to solve this problem,

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:23.106
and I'm going to do the hours
before six and after six.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.007
So I'll start at five
and I'll go up to seven

00:00:25.007 --> 00:00:27.627
just to make sure that
we capture everything.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:29.227
I can draw a straighter line than that,

00:00:29.227 --> 00:00:31.767
so let me draw it a little bit straighter.

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:34.427
It's still not perfect
but it'll do the job.

00:00:34.427 --> 00:00:37.189
So let's say that this is 5 o'clock.

00:00:37.189 --> 00:00:40.182
This is 6 o'clock.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:43.623
And they don't specify
whether it's am or pm.

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.781
And this is 7 o'clock,

00:00:45.806 --> 00:00:47.021
7 o'clock.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.110
They tell us he has to be home

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.008
by a quarter after six, so
what is a quarter after six?

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:55.008
Well it's going to be a quarter of the way

00:00:55.008 --> 00:00:57.368
between 6 and 7 o'clock.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:59.269
So, this would be half of the way

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:01.079
between 6 and 7 o'clock,

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.219
and then a quarter would be half of that.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.875
So this would be a quarter after six,

00:01:05.875 --> 00:01:07.198
and if we wanted to specify

00:01:07.198 --> 00:01:10.089
what time a quarter after six is,

00:01:10.089 --> 00:01:12.779
a quarter of the way
between six and seven.

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:15.379
We know there are 60 minues in an hour

00:01:15.379 --> 00:01:17.179
so this distance is 60 minutes.

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:19.880
A quarter of 60 is 15 minutes,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.401
so this time right over here is 6:15,

00:01:23.401 --> 00:01:25.421
and that's when Chris has to be home.

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:29.201
Now, they tell us that the
trip home takes 39 minutes,

00:01:29.201 --> 00:01:31.480
so he would have had

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.867
to have left 39 minutes before this

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:37.701
in order to get home at 6:15.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.982
So let's go 39 minutes before this

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.283
to figure out the time
that he would have to leave

00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:45.706
in order to be home by 6:15.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.979
So, what is 39 minutes?

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.880
What is 39 minutes before,

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.799
before 6:15?

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.051
Now, the way my brain processes it,

00:01:55.051 --> 00:01:57.271
I like to think about,
well, how much time,

00:01:57.271 --> 00:02:00.071
how much time does it
take to get to the hour,

00:02:00.071 --> 00:02:02.151
and then, how much time do you have left

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:04.531
to kind of go before the hour.

00:02:04.531 --> 00:02:06.711
This part right over here,

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:08.913
this part right over here is 15 minutes.

00:02:08.913 --> 00:02:11.833
If you go back 15 minutes from 6:15

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:13.363
and go to 6 o'clock,

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:15.433
that was 15 minutes.

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:17.949
We've already gone 15 minutes back

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:19.489
if we go to 6 o'clock.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.350
Then how many minutes do
we have left to go back?

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.830
Well we went 15 of the 39,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.738
39 minus 15

00:02:27.763 --> 00:02:30.335
is 24.

00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:34.036
We have to go another 24
minutes before the hour.

00:02:34.036 --> 00:02:36.456
This time right over here.

00:02:36.456 --> 00:02:40.877
This time right over here is 24 minutes,

00:02:40.877 --> 00:02:43.781
24 minutes before,

00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:46.547
before 6 o'clock.

00:02:46.547 --> 00:02:48.807
Before 6 o'clock and once again,

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:50.148
the way we figured it out.

00:02:50.148 --> 00:02:51.628
Look, going from 6:15,

00:02:51.628 --> 00:02:54.128
if you go 15 minutes back,
you get to 6 o'clock.

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:56.448
We had to go 39, so we have 24 left.

00:02:56.448 --> 00:02:59.290
Then we have to go 24
minutes before 6 o'clock.

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.088
But 24 minutes before 6 o'clock

00:03:01.088 --> 00:03:04.413
would be how many minutes after 5 o'clock?

00:03:04.438 --> 00:03:07.618
Once again, we know that
there's 60 minutes in an hour.

00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:10.038
What's 60 minus 24?

00:03:10.038 --> 00:03:11.538
Let me do it right over here.

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:15.737
So 60 minus 24

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:18.952
is equal to 36.

00:03:18.977 --> 00:03:20.816
You could either do that in your head

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:23.596
or you could say, "Hey look,
I could maybe borrow here."

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:26.176
"This is a ten. This is a five or regroup.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:29.216
"Ten minus four is six.
Five minus two is three."

00:03:29.216 --> 00:03:30.757
The way my brain does it is I say,

00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:33.947
"Oh well, 60 minus 30 would get me to 30,

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:35.406
"but then I have to subtract,

00:03:35.406 --> 00:03:39.077
"or 60 minus 20 would get me to 40.

00:03:39.077 --> 00:03:40.200
"and then I need to subtract

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.200
"another four more to get to 36."

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.540
But either way,

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.360
if we're talking about 24
minutes before 6 o'clock,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.596
that's the equivalent to 36 minutes

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.924
after 5 o'clock.

00:03:55.044 --> 00:03:57.084
This time right over here

00:03:57.084 --> 00:04:00.604
is 5:36.

00:04:00.604 --> 00:04:02.484
When they say what time does Chris have

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:05.645
to leave in order to be
home by a quarter after six?

00:04:05.645 --> 00:04:08.290
5:36.
