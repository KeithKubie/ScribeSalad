00:00:00.623 --> 00:00:05.180
 "Humans eat hallucinogens, especially" magic mushrooms for more than nine thousand years 

00:00:05.414 --> 00:00:10.761
 Even today, this natural fungus is used as an ecstasy drug, causing hallucinations 

00:00:10.982 --> 00:00:13.046
 But how exactly does it work? 

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:16.675
 The main substance "psychologically active in mushroom" is called silosepine 

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:21.637
 When ingested, the body decomposes into the active compound seloxin, which reaches the brain 

00:00:21.799 --> 00:00:26.815
 This begins to prevent the re-uptake of the neurotransmitter called serotonin, which increases its effectiveness 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:30.903
 "Moreover, seloxin ... has a chemical structure similar to serotonin 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.199
 Which means that it can stimulate the receptors in the brain and bind them 

00:00:34.342 --> 00:00:39.197
 This overstimulated stimulus makes you realize and test things without any real stimulus 

00:00:39.343 --> 00:00:41.197
 Which is known as hallucinations 

00:00:41.348 --> 00:00:44.840
 These hallucinations may have ... a diverse nature of visual and acoustic sensations 

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:46.777
 Or introspection and insight 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.026
 ... although the experience may be very enjoyable 

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:51.756
 However, some drug abusers spoke about their experiences with abhorrent experiences 

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.621
 These feelings generally last from 3 to 8 hours 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.116
 But it may look much longer because of the change of anesthetic for your perception of time 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.777
 Scientists have also suggested that the brain ... may rearrange itself temporarily 

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:03.658
 ... by preventing normal brain activity 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.268
 And the creation of new, fully biologically stable brain connections 

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:12.792
 This makes it difficult to distinguish ... reality from imagination and amplifies the density of your thoughts 

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:16.423
 Making advance planning and conscious thinking almost impossible 

00:01:16.577 --> 00:01:22.299
 We also see active areas of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex associated with dreams 

00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:25.826
 Finally, emotional areas of the brain are activated chemically 

00:01:25.885 --> 00:01:28.651
 It may lead to a sense of expanded awareness 

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:31.829
 Because the drug temporarily shifts the passages in your brain 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.566
 "Become" thinking outside the box any creative "very natural" 

00:01:34.732 --> 00:01:36.198
 ... in a popular study in the United States 

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:39.198
 ... "36 students from the universities were given the silosepine 

00:01:39.274 --> 00:01:40.777
 They were monitored in the laboratory 

00:01:40.952 --> 00:01:46.560
 One-third of respondents said it was one of the most spiritual experiences of their lives 

00:01:46.643 --> 00:01:49.033
 And two-thirds put it among the top five experiences in their lives 

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:50.517
 ... after two months of taking the drug 

00:01:50.591 --> 00:01:54.647
 79% of participants showed signs of increased satisfaction and improved overall status 

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.775
 Family and friends were interviewed and confirmed these allegations 

00:01:57.898 --> 00:01:59.672
 But not all mushrooms are positive 

00:01:59.806 --> 00:02:02.433
 ... where 22% of individuals are clinically tested 

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:05.917
 They felt frightened and suspicious at certain moments during their experience 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:11.569
 Because of the state of their brains, they generally appeared as uncontrollable horrors 

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:13.481
 ... although we still do not know much about magic mushrooms 

00:02:13.557 --> 00:02:18.184
 However, it is not considered clinically addictive and causes little toxicity to other members of the body 

00:02:18.302 --> 00:02:23.378
 In fact, a study in the UK found that it caused less harm to users and those around them 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.731
 Compared to other narcotic drugs 

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:30.024
 Scientists believe that laws should change ... towards clinical testing of this drug 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 ... in order to conduct advanced research 

00:02:31.965 --> 00:02:37.161
 To understand the positive and negative effects of "magic fungus" on our brains
