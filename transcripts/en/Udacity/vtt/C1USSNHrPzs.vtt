00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Here's my answer--very simple--iterate over over the rows

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
and over the squares in each row print one out.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
A comma at the end of the print statement says put in a space but not a new line.

00:00:11.000 --> 09:59:59.000
At the end of each row, that's where I put in a new line.
