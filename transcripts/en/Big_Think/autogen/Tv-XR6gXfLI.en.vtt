ecology there are a couple of places
where there's clearly a lot of value

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010
where there's clearly a lot of value
 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.679

but in many ways again like the early

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040

days of the web we don't yet know what

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
days of the web we don't yet know what
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.520
days of the web we don't yet know what
the big winners will be and that from

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530
the big winners will be and that from
 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.229
the big winners will be and that from
the technology right but we know that

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239
the technology right but we know that
 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.940
the technology right but we know that
that this is something everybody will

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950
that this is something everybody will
 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.860
that this is something everybody will
need in one way or another so the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870
need in one way or another so the
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.300
need in one way or another so the
challenge right now is there's a lot of

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310
challenge right now is there's a lot of
 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.860
challenge right now is there's a lot of
options and many of them are fairly

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870

systems that's one reason we've chosen a
hyper ledger to focus on what are the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480
hyper ledger to focus on what are the
 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.210

simplest things we can do now and ship

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220
simplest things we can do now and ship
 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.640
simplest things we can do now and ship
out as product that people can use right

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650
out as product that people can use right
 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.069
out as product that people can use right
that they can actually run and the

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079
that they can actually run and the
 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.569
that they can actually run and the
second thing is really understanding

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
second thing is really understanding
 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.280
second thing is really understanding
that and this is really hard for many

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290
that and this is really hard for many
 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.050
that and this is really hard for many
