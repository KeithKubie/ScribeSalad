00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is yes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In nearly all cases of mapping, we have robot uncertainty in motion.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
That uncertainty might grow over time.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We need to address this; otherwise the map looks really bad.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Let me give an example .

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Suppose a robot drives down a corridor, and it senses surrounding walls.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
If this robot has a drift problem and because of uncertainty it its motion,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
it actually believes it drives a trajectory like this.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Then the surrounding map would look very much like that.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Now, these might be indistinguishable at first glance,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
but if this robot ever comes back to the same place,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
then it has an opportunity to correct all this.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
A good SLAM technique is able to understand not just the fact that the environment

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
is uncertain but also the robot itself runs on an uncertain trajectory.

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That makes it hard.
