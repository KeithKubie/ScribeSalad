1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:01,950
So,
um,

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,950
we just got to move on now and follow
up on what we talked about last time,

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,110
which is the seven fold permutation
is as kind of intimidating, um,

4
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,130
but it's actually what we'll be talking
about in the fall class that was devoted

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,180
to for whom devout hose.
Um,

6
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:24,350
and last time we talked a lot about
the voluntary versus involuntary

7
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,580
association, including, um, the idea
of the involuntary foreigners, right?

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,740
That both Americans and
the Spanish actually, um,

9
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,700
can be involuntary foreigners,

10
00:00:35,701 --> 00:00:40,410
the Americans in the simple fact that
they don't have perfect command of the

11
00:00:40,411 --> 00:00:43,750
language and also that they
are recognizable as far and as,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,480
as outsiders in the community.

13
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,920
But the Spanish can also be
outsiders in their own community, uh,

14
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,750
because of two things because of the
print illiteracy and because of the 10 of

15
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:58,830
the logical, uh, illiteracy.
So in those two ways, um,

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,750
they are both stuck with a kind
of voluntary association. Um,

17
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,670
today we'll move on to the
next, uh, way to configure,

18
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,140
um, the contents of for whom
the bell tolls. And, um,

19
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,000
I'd like to think of it as a very
sustained structure. Hemingway, um,

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,160
is, uh, uh, a writer
who actually, um, keeps,

21
00:01:23,161 --> 00:01:27,780
not only starts out with a pattern,
but kids elaborating on that pattern.

22
00:01:27,781 --> 00:01:32,190
So in many ways it really is a kind of a
musical structure, FEMA and very Asian,

23
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:32,970
um,

24
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,970
and the paradigm of distant home versus
onsite environment that actually is a

25
00:01:37,981 --> 00:01:42,940
theme and variation almost out the
entire for whom the bell tolls,

26
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:43,650
um,

27
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:48,650
and plugged into that is a kind of
play between the comic and the tragic.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,150
Uh, but really the, the main,

29
00:01:51,151 --> 00:01:55,950
the dominant theme today would be the
relation between distant homes and onsite

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,900
environment. Um, so I've seven
candidates for distant homes.

31
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:05,430
One is, um, in Paris, which
is very odd because you know,

32
00:02:05,431 --> 00:02:09,950
already where in the foreign countries
to American readers, um, Spain, uh,

33
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,880
but there's yet another foreign
country of France and especially Paris,

34
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:19,380
uh, which makes a cameo appearance.
Um, and then they have five locations,

35
00:02:19,381 --> 00:02:23,580
we'll spatial locations and 10 fro
locations in the United States that are

36
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,190
distant homes for Robert Jordan.

37
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:30,860
So we'll talk about why each of them
is involved. Um, and relation betrayal,

38
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,700
that distant home and the immediate
is Spanish setting. But first of all,

39
00:02:35,701 --> 00:02:38,380
Perez, um, Paris comes up, um,

40
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:43,230
in the context of Robert Drinking the
abstinence that he carries with him.

41
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,280
Um,

42
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,600
and right before that he's actually asked
for wine and there's not a lot is one

43
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:52,200
left. So Maria wants to give him one.
The public says there's not much left,

44
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,730
so he doesn't get to have to unwind
from the, from the, just the,

45
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,080
from the logos. Um, and instead he
pulls out this bottle of absence.

46
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,900
Um, and nobody there has seen this. Um,

47
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,370
so he tells them that
this is Madison and um,

48
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,290
the Gypsy state wants to tase where
there's medicine tastes like Robert Jordan

49
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:15,970
pushed the cup to what him,

50
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,360
it was milky yellow now with the water.

51
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:23,290
And he hoped that Gypsy would
not take more than a swallow.

52
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,690
And this was very little of it left.

53
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:30,960
And one cup of it took the place of the
evening papers of all the old evenings

54
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:37,320
in cafes of all IHG has not trays that
would be in bloom now in this month of

55
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:42,820
the gray slow horses of the
outer boulevards of bookshops,

56
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,970
of chaos and of galleries of the pop here
of the stat about the stock buffalo of

57
00:03:49,871 --> 00:03:54,110
the beauty Shamone of the
guaranty trust company. And again,

58
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,350
there was a day or four years,

59
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,410
oh hotel and being able to read and
relaxed in the evening of all the things

60
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:03,730
they enjoy it and forgotten.

61
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,530
And that came back to him
when he tasted that peg,

62
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:11,620
that her tone now main brain warming,

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:16,180
stomach warming,
idea changing liquid alchemy.

64
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,990
This is as beautiful praise
on to Paris as I've seen.

65
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,030
Um,

66
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,030
but what is odd about this praise Song
of Paris is that it actually is not

67
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,310
pointing to all the monumental,
um,

68
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,730
tourists attractions of Paris,
right? No Ivo Towel in there.

69
00:04:38,731 --> 00:04:42,700
I know off the tree on, um,
instead it is the chestnut trees,

70
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:47,230
actually the horse chestnuts
in this picture. Um,

71
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:51,760
but chestnut trees all from
Harris v very common site.

72
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:55,920
Um, kiosk, very, very common site. Um,

73
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:59,350
hot most who he is is not really,
it's actually kind of, um,

74
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,490
out of the way and it's not, it's not
very spectacular. It's just a park.

75
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,190
Um, and then this stat buffalo,
actually, I've never, I don't eat,

76
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:13,210
I have to look it up. You might not even
be there. Um, it's a cycling tracks. Um,

77
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,230
and then the pop, the abuse, um,

78
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:21,070
it's also not mean it's a nice pop,
but I don't think it's that famous. Um,

79
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,580
is more of a kind of a neighborhood park.
It's on the hill.

80
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,680
So are kind of this Hillary structure.

81
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,150
This is the Butte that
gives the pop the name. Um,

82
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,800
and that year they elicit is the, uh,
island in the middle of the sand. Um,

83
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,140
it's very beautiful place. But once
again, this is a neighborhood rather than,

84
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:41,680
you know, kind of major tourist
attraction. Although the, um,

85
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,660
the Notredam Cathedral, um,
is there, um, and finally,

86
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,310
uh, the hotel for you, once again,
it's a, you know, as a legend.

87
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:51,940
Um,

88
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,500
but there's also a place that you would
just walk by every day without noticing

89
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:57,260
it.

90
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,970
And that's really the main
point is that all those names,

91
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,620
um,
this,

92
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:07,610
I don't even think it is Hemingway's name
dropping because those names as we are

93
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:12,080
not rex recognizable to most of us.
Those are just a neighborhood

94
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,500
features, a logo features of one
particular various Paris neighborhoods.

95
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,550
Um,

96
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,550
and those are the things that people
would walk by every day and just take them

97
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:29,060
for granted.
And that is really what Harris means.

98
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,580
Uh, for Hemingway, he did spend, well for
him. I learned also for Robert Jordan.

99
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:39,620
Anyway, this spent several years
in Paris. He wrote about it, um,

100
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:44,780
in a movable feast. Uh, so, and
he, he wrote very well in Paris.

101
00:06:44,781 --> 00:06:49,460
He said he could have stay right about
Michigan best when he was in Paris.

102
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,630
He said that in the
movable fees. Um, so it,

103
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,150
it was Hemingway's home.
Um,

104
00:06:56,210 --> 00:07:00,050
in a sense that is a place
where a writer could write.

105
00:07:00,051 --> 00:07:04,910
And I think that there really is no better
definition of whom home is that as a

106
00:07:04,911 --> 00:07:08,930
place where you can work with ourselves
consciousness where you have a work

107
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,040
routine,
um,

108
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:15,170
and you can count on being able to produce
something every day. That's for me,

109
00:07:15,171 --> 00:07:19,690
that's also actually my, my own
definition of home. Um, so I'm in,

110
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,850
so it's kind of a minor variation on,

111
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:26,660
on the Hemingways can total
obsession with writing. Um,

112
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,720
but, um, so it just, you
don't have to think about it.

113
00:07:29,721 --> 00:07:33,760
It's just there every day and you can
just do the same thing every day. Um,

114
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,950
so that is the, it's the security. Um,

115
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,150
and the every day knows our Paris
that is contrasted with the,

116
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,740
um, onsite environment,
which is very violent,

117
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,140
unpredictable where he's
so obviously a foreigner,

118
00:07:51,141 --> 00:07:54,350
even though Hemingway was
so far in, uh, in Paris, um,

119
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,590
the fact that he was able to
write so well in Paris and that,

120
00:07:57,591 --> 00:08:02,480
that as they sue the
foreigners with the racket, um,

121
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:07,220
by his very, um, productive
relation to his own craft, um,

122
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:11,240
here, um, this in Spain's a
totally different relations.

123
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:16,241
So we'll look at what comes after that
invocation in his own mind of Paris that

124
00:08:18,951 --> 00:08:21,580
is brought on by the absence.
Um,

125
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,680
the Gypsy may the face and handed
the cup back is smells of banners,

126
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,390
but it's bitter as gall.

127
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:34,420
He said it is better to be
safe than have that medicine.

128
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,620
That's the wormwood probably told until
them in this through real absent there

129
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:44,000
is wormwood is supposed to rot your
brain out. But I don't believe it.

130
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:48,830
It only changes the ideas.
You should pour water in to it.

131
00:08:48,831 --> 00:08:53,780
Very slowly. A few drops at a time.
But I brought it into the water,

132
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:58,200
whether you saying hello, said
angrily, feeling the mockery,

133
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,460
explaining the Madison rubbish
and told him in Greenland,

134
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,920
I've bought it in Madrid.

135
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,270
It was the last bottle and
it's lasted me three weeks.

136
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:14,780
He took a big swallow of it and felt it
coasting over his tone and delicate and

137
00:09:15,061 --> 00:09:18,720
the Stesha in looked at
Pablo and grinned again.

138
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,560
So we've seen how aggressive the low
hosts can be when it comes to hopping on

139
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:27,500
Kashkin. Right. And you
know, there's four other,

140
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,040
just like Robin ran name debt.
Um,

141
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,200
Ooh, what's the explosive, um,
the aggressions on the logos, um,

142
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,380
is very well matched by when I would say
is to sue the good natured aggression.

143
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:47,790
But none the less aggression
on the part of Robert.

144
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,740
Um, these people know nothing about Paris
then never have been outside of Spain.

145
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,850
Um, they've never been able to
have the local community. Um,

146
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,760
so it seems that some of them,

147
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,940
many of them have never
been to Madrid even, ah,

148
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:07,790
because these are the local good drillers.
They have, you know, very much these,

149
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:11,460
they put in their own small community.
Um,

150
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,690
so even the drip is in many
ways a foreign country to them.

151
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:20,940
And Rather John in the American, there
was Perez, he knows the capital of Spain.

152
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,320
He knows this liquor they're never tasted,

153
00:10:25,321 --> 00:10:30,290
and he's fooling them into thinking
that this medicine, um, and his mother,

154
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,310
the last bottle of absence and Madrid.
Um,

155
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,310
so all of this, just like
the print illiteracy, um,

156
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,060
the, he comes apart, he just
discovers without meaning to, um,

157
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:50,120
this is actively highlighting the fact
that he is much more a man of the world

158
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:55,060
than they are. And there's no
competition, right? I mean,

159
00:10:55,080 --> 00:11:00,080
this is a very well travel man just by
the nature of what he's doing is wild

160
00:11:01,011 --> 00:11:02,490
travel.
Um,

161
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,060
and these people are completely
rooted in their own environment.

162
00:11:06,061 --> 00:11:11,061
Although I should say that
it is an entirely Alton
question by the Anna's novel,

163
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,480
um,

164
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,480
which is the better fair whether it is
the weld travel person who has a better

165
00:11:17,671 --> 00:11:21,370
future or whether it's actually people
who are rooted in the environments who

166
00:11:21,371 --> 00:11:24,070
have a better future. I think it's
very much an open question. Um,

167
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,740
but by the end as an Avo at this moment
though, this is the moment when, uh,

168
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,830
Robert has his law of victory over the
locals are just able to show them all the

169
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:34,734
things,

170
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:39,540
highlight dramatized to them other things
that he knows that they don't know.

171
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,560
Um,

172
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,560
so the first location of a distant
home has the effect actually,

173
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:51,150
uh,
bringing out an edge to say the least.

174
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,920
And Pablo suddenly recognizes that,
um,

175
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:00,060
and edge attention between Robert and
the locals who otherwise his comrades on

176
00:12:01,901 --> 00:12:06,760
the same side of the war. Um, it
has a funny effect on both sides.

177
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:11,530
It does something to Robert, it
does something to the locos. Um,

178
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,080
and that's just not even in
America. That's, you know,

179
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:18,700
Paris is really doesn't have any kind
of special connotation, I don't think,

180
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,070
um, to, to the vocals in a sense that
it, Robert is not really, you know,

181
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:27,550
um, never consider Frenchmen. Um,

182
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,780
but when it comes to the invocation of
the United States is a different story.

183
00:12:31,781 --> 00:12:36,100
They all know that that's something
that he has a relation to. Um,

184
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,540
and the eye within the progression.
Um, this is the kind of,

185
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,920
we're starting out with the most
benign, uh, most kind of, um,

186
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,300
at least not completely,

187
00:12:46,301 --> 00:12:49,810
not an innocuous invocation of
the United States and businesses.

188
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:51,940
Most Missoula Montana,

189
00:12:51,941 --> 00:12:56,830
where Robert Jordan it's from and where
he's thinking that he would go back to

190
00:12:56,890 --> 00:13:01,740
after war and that maybe he'll
take them rear, um, with him. Um,

191
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:03,670
and this is actually a good
moment to think about, you know,

192
00:13:03,671 --> 00:13:07,870
exactly the nature of that Romance
Between Rama, Jordan and Maria.

193
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,290
Why don't marry her sure
that I will marry her.

194
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,710
Then we'll be mister and missus
Robert Jordan of Sun Valley,

195
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:19,120
Idaho or Corpus Christi is
taxes of Beautiful Montana.

196
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,470
Spanish girls make wonderful wives.
I've never had one. So I know,

197
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,780
and when I get my job back
at a university, she can
be an instructor's wife.

198
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:33,430
And when undergraduates who take Spanish
four come into smoke pipes in the

199
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:38,431
evening and have those feel
valuable informal discussions
about Queer Vedo Lope,

200
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:42,850
Invega Geldof's and other
always admirable debt,

201
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,870
Maria can tell them about
how some of the blue shirt,

202
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:51,890
the crusaders for the true faith set on
her head while others twisted her arms

203
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,550
and put the skirts up and
stuffed it in her mouth.

204
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:03,100
Um, it, I began by saying
that this is relatively high,

205
00:14:03,101 --> 00:14:08,101
but if in fact there's no such thing as
benign evocation of a distant home in

206
00:14:08,981 --> 00:14:11,920
Hemingway, it might start out, you
know, even from beginning to end.

207
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,870
Is there's something very funny
about the tone of that invocation.

208
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,090
Um, the first poll of it
is, it's just a kind of, um,

209
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:26,550
the first little bit of that about
going back to all the cities, you know,

210
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,170
the kind of the heartland of America.
Um,

211
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,780
and then the particular job that he had,

212
00:14:31,781 --> 00:14:35,740
he was a professor at a university.

213
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm teaching Spanish. Um, and the
kind of the joke about, you know,

214
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:43,060
people coming in,
informal discussions best,

215
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,850
I would say that actually it's kind
of a benign or in the sense that, um,

216
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:51,010
we all tend to be ironic about things
actually that we are quite attached to.

217
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,550
I know this, yesterday I was
talking about a riot as I love, um,

218
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:58,940
who writes about food and I said, you
know, she's corners just two books out,

219
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,880
one suit. And I said that she
cornered the market on foot writing.

220
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,710
It wasn't as long and they
really looked at me. Um,

221
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:09,560
but I mean actually love this
author. Um, but that's just my way,

222
00:15:09,561 --> 00:15:13,290
you know, of, of, of not being,
being too attached and you know,

223
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:17,840
showing some critical distance.
Um, so the first part of their, um,

224
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:23,480
of, of, of that is just the kinds
of the typical professional RNA. Um,

225
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:27,330
you know, it was something that you
really actually do want to go back to and,

226
00:15:27,331 --> 00:15:31,310
and, and w, you know, have
some yearning for. Um,

227
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,890
but in the midst of that, um, the,

228
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,233
um,

229
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:44,080
the Robert just can't stop himself
from importing something else to that

230
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,040
otherwise benign environment.

231
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:54,370
And so we sort of know ahead of time that
Maria was once rate with no idea when

232
00:15:56,181 --> 00:15:59,330
that happened. Um, is it,

233
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,880
this is Hemingway's way
of telling the story.

234
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm giving this and he says of the story,

235
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,360
uh,
one at a time.

236
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,340
So this particular input Asian,
um,

237
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,400
of something that happens in Spain
into an otherwise innocent American

238
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:24,250
environment has to weigh not only of
darkening the textures of that otherwise

239
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,640
innocent college town,
um,

240
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,700
but also completely changes his
relation to the local setting.

241
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:38,180
Um, is not even just a place where
he's having trouble with Paolo.

242
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:40,680
That's the least of the problem.
Um,

243
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,910
they are much more deep rooted problems.
Um,

244
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:49,990
so this is another spin on the idea
of being rooted in your community.

245
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:54,830
Um, usually when we think of
being rooted in our community, uh,

246
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:57,830
we just think of, you know, being,
having stayed there for a long time,

247
00:16:57,831 --> 00:17:00,940
maybe having been there for generations,
uh,

248
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,610
or at least within the life of
a person many, many years. Um,

249
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,920
and usually is a good thing.
But this,

250
00:17:06,921 --> 00:17:10,730
another way in which being
rooted in your environment, um,

251
00:17:11,210 --> 00:17:16,130
means that all the dark episodes from
the past are visited upon you all.

252
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:21,080
A few other oh angers, oh hatreds, um,

253
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:26,140
are constantly being reactivated
sometimes just in memory and sometimes

254
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,240
reenacted in the bodies of people who
are otherwise young and is very young

255
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:36,500
girl. Um, but was being visited
upon her is not personal.

256
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:40,160
It really has nothing to do with her,
is not,

257
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:45,270
they don't mean to write Maria,
they made raping, verve, um,

258
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:50,070
as a symbol or something else. So
this is the other, this is hazard of,

259
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,840
um, spending all your life and being
rooted in one particular community.

260
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,700
Um, is that ancient angers, um, can,

261
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:04,860
uh, can be inherited by, by people
who are relatively young. So,

262
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,480
um,
this,

263
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,130
I will say this is the basic dynamics of
the relation between the United States

264
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,780
and Spain, is that there's a kind
of a spill over in both directions,

265
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,520
um, something very violence spilling
over into the American context. Um,

266
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,440
and then we'll see another way in which
the violence of the American context

267
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:30,390
will spill over into the
Spanish setting. Um, and um,

268
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,860
this is Ashley.
This is still relatively benign instance.

269
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,510
Um, but again, something
just not quite right.

270
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,920
Um,
yes.

271
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,510
And talking about Gypsies and I was just
say that the Hemingway actually is very,

272
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:48,900
um, um, uh,

273
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:50,880
kind of surprisingly,

274
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:55,620
I'm fascinated about the problem of the
Gypsy even as they're now called Roma

275
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:00,030
and is a huge problem in the sense
that the year that European Union is

276
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:04,620
recognizing the fact that the role most
actually have always been oppressed by

277
00:19:04,621 --> 00:19:09,330
various national government. And so
it's a quite a big issue in Europe. Um,

278
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:11,460
and Hemingway back in the,
in the,

279
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:16,450
when he was writing about Spanish or
war ready seem to have caught on? Um,

280
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:21,090
yes. And Samuel said the Gypsies belief
the bearer to be a brother of man.

281
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:26,220
So also believe the Indians in America,
Robert Jordan said,

282
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,390
and where they kill a bear,
they apologized to him and asked his part.

283
00:19:31,391 --> 00:19:34,260
And do you have any gypsy blood?
No,

284
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,520
but I seen much of them and
clearly seems to movement more.

285
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:41,820
They are many in the hills to them.

286
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,690
It is not as sin to
kill outside the tribe.

287
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,120
They deny this. But it is
true like the Moore's. Okay.

288
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:55,890
So it is not as sin to kill
outside tribe usually. I mean,

289
00:19:55,891 --> 00:20:00,030
if most of us, I think no, the in
gelatin is against killing period. Right?

290
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,390
So there's just no qualifying,
no qualify after that.

291
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,050
But according to the Samo,

292
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,640
it is completely okay for the Gypsies
to kill anyone outside of the immediate

293
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:15,410
tribe. So you know, is a straight, um,

294
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,850
ethnic divide within your own tribe.

295
00:20:18,210 --> 00:20:22,230
You don't kill anyone or you don't cure
anyone unless you are under serious

296
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,920
[inaudible] outside of your tribe,
you're free to kill anyone.

297
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,850
So that's of been crowd
or charge two level, um,

298
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,770
against the Gypsies.

299
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:37,520
But what is weird is that rather than
comes up with this and Knology is then to

300
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:41,880
Gypsies. I just liked the morals. Okay.

301
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,670
So this might not make
any sense to us right now,

302
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:49,880
but it turns out that this is actually
one of aspects of the deep cultural

303
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:54,840
groups in Spain. Um,
this is a beautiful, um,

304
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,480
instance of the mortgage
architecture in Spain.

305
00:20:58,510 --> 00:21:03,460
You guys know that the
Moore's, um, from Africa,

306
00:21:03,461 --> 00:21:05,260
from North Africa,
um,

307
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:09,310
Ashley were the rulers
in Spain for 800 years.

308
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:14,670
It was in 1492 the same year that
Columbus discover the new world.

309
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:20,200
It was the same year that the Moore's
were expelled from Spain along with Jews.

310
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:25,260
The more than the Jews were the two
persecuted ethnic groups in Spain.

311
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,480
Um, and so, uh, what,

312
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:33,600
what Isabella of Castille,
um, expelled the, the,

313
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,080
the, the from Granada, uh, other, um,

314
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,220
there was a, uh, policy,
uh, throughout Spain, um,

315
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,160
to try to erase, um,
Islamic book learning. Um,

316
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,960
Carter above was a huge,
uh,

317
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:55,600
centered learning throughout the Middle
Ages. Um, and people from all over Europe.

318
00:21:55,870 --> 00:22:00,700
We'd go the call over to study Arabic
science was very, very advanced,

319
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,950
Arabic, more edge architecture was
beautiful. Um, Coloma had bath houses,

320
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:08,380
more public baths than
any other city in Europe.

321
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,610
It was basically a beacon of enlightenment
in Spain, in, in all of Europe. Um,

322
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,490
and when they were
destroyed by the Catholic,

323
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:22,210
um, forces by the Catholic monarchs, um,

324
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:27,930
there was a much of an attempt to try to
erase all of that wasn't as successful.

325
00:22:28,271 --> 00:22:31,930
So we still today if we were to
go to quarterback or two later,

326
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:36,550
we're still seeing lots of borage
architecture. So there's one kind of,

327
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,593
um,

328
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:42,430
saw point in Spanish history is that
they really have done this to the very

329
00:22:42,431 --> 00:22:44,980
glorious, that legislation. Um,

330
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,270
but there's another sore point that is
more immediate to the Spanish civil war.

331
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:54,660
And this is reported by the American
poet most and he was who was there along

332
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,860
with Hemingway.
Um,

333
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,950
and lesson hills was really struck by
the presence of the Morris in the Spanish

334
00:23:02,561 --> 00:23:03,530
civil war.
Um,

335
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:07,980
so he wrote several pieces
about the Moore's outs,

336
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:13,110
sometimes seeing them in the hospitals
and actually having this very uneasy

337
00:23:13,631 --> 00:23:17,780
kinship between himself. And
the more, so this is, uh,

338
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:22,830
from his essay general Franco's Morris
to Morris truths were colonial crimes.

339
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,220
Grips on man from the Moroccan,

340
00:23:25,221 --> 00:23:29,730
the villages and ties into the
army by offers was theme to them.

341
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,700
Very good pay.

342
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,110
Franco's personal body guard
consisted of war as soldiers,

343
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,440
tall picture as fellows and flowing ropes
and winding turbans before I left home

344
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,350
American papers like Harry photographs
of turban or hammered and troops marching

345
00:23:46,971 --> 00:23:51,020
in the streets of Bogos. They'll
am locker and then, you know,

346
00:23:51,021 --> 00:23:56,021
then press dispatched from gelato that
summer and said Arabs having crossing

347
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,500
this trace that you brought Gibraltar
from Spanish Morocco to Algiers theorists

348
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,690
and a locker at a rate of 300,
400 a day.

349
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:11,560
General Franco intends to mass
50,000 new aerators in Spain.

350
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,580
So given the past history,
given the,

351
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:20,300
an easy relation between the Spanish,
it's the Spanish and,

352
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:25,510
and more Asian population of North Africa
for General Franco Ashley to use the

353
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:32,951
Morris trips as very active combat unit
against the Spanish Republican side that

354
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,230
is about the worst he could have done
was successful. Actually, you know,

355
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,800
he won the war.
Um,

356
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,880
but it was about was in
terms of being Tom Death,

357
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:51,920
he was probably about as tone deaf as
anyone could be one at the end. Um,

358
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:53,900
but, um, that's what happened.

359
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:59,170
And so they were in the loss and loss
of pink lots and lots of pictures of um,

360
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:02,840
the worst crossing over from Africa,

361
00:25:02,841 --> 00:25:06,170
just paying a five fight
the Spanish republic here,

362
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:09,870
here's a mortgage bodyguards and um,

363
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:13,760
the engage in then engage
in more active combat.

364
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:19,460
Um, so to bring up two more years,
um, I don't even know if it's,

365
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,350
you know, what motivates, um,

366
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,270
Robert to make that analogy
between the GPS and invoice,

367
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,210
it couldn't really be,
um,

368
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:32,390
just blinders or just carelessness.

369
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:35,600
I think there's some
intentionality in there,

370
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,970
but it's hard to know why he
would want to bring up this very,

371
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,900
very sensitive issue for the
Spanish. Um, so I think that,

372
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:45,680
um,

373
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,680
or we can say is that it
seems that it's very easy,

374
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,650
um, for an involuntary, for other, um,

375
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:59,740
to say something that is wounding to
locals maybe without intending it to have

376
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,530
the extent of the in south
the extended injury. Um,

377
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,350
that is actually the actual outcome
of saying something like that. Um,

378
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:17,390
Robert probably had no idea that managing
them wars with create those kinds of

379
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:22,510
connotations. Um, those kinds
of, um, just just as you know,

380
00:26:22,511 --> 00:26:26,480
is um, on the part of this vantage
hearers, but there's, um, what he's doing.

381
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,431
So once again,

382
00:26:27,431 --> 00:26:31,670
it kind of spilling over thinking about
native Americans with their own very

383
00:26:31,671 --> 00:26:33,500
uneasy history in the United States.

384
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:37,220
Think about the roof Americans thinking
about Gypsy's in Europe and thinking

385
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:39,800
about the Moore's three ethnic groups,

386
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,620
all with uneasy histories behind them.

387
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:48,980
And it is the invocation of all three of
them in the same breath that makes that

388
00:26:49,531 --> 00:26:53,930
particular exchange especially,
um, uncomfortable. Um,

389
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,950
if not downright hurtful, but, um,
let's just look at them more serious,

390
00:26:59,010 --> 00:27:01,240
instant, um, incidence of, of,

391
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:05,520
of this kind of distant home being
the kind of irritation, um, uh, to,

392
00:27:05,521 --> 00:27:07,640
to the immediate environment.
Um,

393
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:12,680
so also I'll know where Robert Johnson
and they start talking about lynching in

394
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:17,910
Ohio. Um, this is completely uncalled for.

395
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,150
This is in the context of talking
about the execution of the fascist.

396
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,210
And out of the blue,

397
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:32,510
Robert just mentioned this lynching
that he was the witness to,

398
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,990
um, and about the trunk and there's
on, they've had them done in it.

399
00:27:36,991 --> 00:27:40,620
So people in general, um, it
is so rubbish on is that, um,

400
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:45,600
when I was seven years old and going
with my mother to attend a wedding in the

401
00:27:45,601 --> 00:27:50,601
state of Ohio at which I was to be
the boy of a Po boy and girl who carry

402
00:27:51,001 --> 00:27:54,120
flowers. Did you do that?
That Maria, how nice.

403
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:59,690
In this town and Negro was hand to
a lamppost and they been burned.

404
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:05,220
It was an arc light, a light which
lower from the post to the pavement.

405
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,740
And he was hoisted first by the mechanism,
which was used to hoist the arc light.

406
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,850
But this broke,
this is a bizarre,

407
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:16,380
um,

408
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:21,380
description of lynching to say the least
is stuck in the middle of this long

409
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,270
story about execution of the fascist.
And not only that,

410
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,900
but it seems that much of the focus is
on the mechanism was hoisting this person

411
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:37,520
up who's about to be,
um,

412
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:41,940
and on how unreliable this mechanism is,
um,

413
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:46,980
that it adds to it bricks ones. And then
he was asked to be done over again. So,

414
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,083
um,

415
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:52,740
what we can say is that this
kind of slightly out of Focus,

416
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,360
um, uh, nature, uh,

417
00:28:56,430 --> 00:29:00,900
to the invocation of the United
States, um, the proper focus,

418
00:29:00,901 --> 00:29:03,660
really odd to be on the
act of lynching yourself.

419
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:08,010
Anyone telling the story it would have
been on the APP of lynching and instead

420
00:29:08,011 --> 00:29:09,960
it is our focus.
So that's,

421
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,250
it somehow is just focus on the
mechanism of hoisting the person up.

422
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,510
Um, and I think there's
a kind of a deliberate,

423
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,760
Lorraine is there suggest that this is
really how the United States looks, um,

424
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,600
to the Spanish logos that you know,

425
00:29:24,601 --> 00:29:29,601
they can get the focus right if some how
off and that all focus is dramatized by

426
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,670
Maria's response.

427
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:37,500
We just kind of completely inappropriate
shows the highest degree of ignorance.

428
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,440
Um, well she doesn't know what's coming,
but you know, just to say how nice.

429
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:45,820
She has no idea. She's completely,
all of it. Doesn't get any of it. Um,

430
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:49,900
so the reference to the lynching,

431
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:55,380
my seem out of the blue to us reading
a forum to the belt hosts right now,

432
00:29:55,690 --> 00:29:59,130
but lynching actually was a big issue,
um,

433
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:02,130
all through the 1930 is um,

434
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:07,170
even though the actual number of
lynching had declined at that point,

435
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,610
um, it was highlighted. Um,

436
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,870
it was brought to the public
consciousness for a number of reasons. Um,

437
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:15,360
one is,
um,

438
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:19,930
this very famous song and I think that
you guys probably have heard Billie

439
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:23,730
holiday, strange fruit, 1939. Um,

440
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:27,100
it's a great collaboration between um,

441
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,770
a black singer and actually
the song writer, um,

442
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,720
is um, with Jewish, um,
April Mirror on the wall.

443
00:30:35,721 --> 00:30:40,430
So this is one of the first instances
of a black Jewish collaboration with

444
00:30:40,431 --> 00:30:44,130
having in this class,
like, um, a song, um,

445
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,670
in the jazz repertoire.

446
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:50,980
But these are the lyrics of strange food
and you can see why it would that image

447
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:56,440
with lead to those lyrics.
Selling trees,

448
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,740
Bayer strange fruit,
blood on the leaves,

449
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:04,060
blood at the rude black bodies
swinging in the southern breeze,

450
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,060
strange fruit hanging from
the path of the trees.

451
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,780
Pastoral scene of the gallon self,

452
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,050
the bulging eyes and the
twisting of the sentiment.

453
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:19,870
Nalliah is Sweden fresh than the
southern smell burning flesh.

454
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Here is a fruit for Lacrosse to blog for
the rain together for the winter stuff.

455
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,490
Stop The Sun to rot from the tree to drop
here is a strange and there's a crap,

456
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:33,910
um,

457
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:38,910
the lyrics than Billie holiday was
the one who made the song famous,

458
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,930
but really it was an Abl,
mere Roho that,

459
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,800
that made. The songs are
such a great song. Um,

460
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:51,010
and I think the power of the song
religious comes from the contrast,

461
00:31:51,011 --> 00:31:55,300
the arch and the rhythm between the kind
of cliche image and the south, you know,

462
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:59,260
the past road south, um, the Madonna,
Leah, the smell of the Magnolia.

463
00:31:59,261 --> 00:32:02,950
And then the smell of burning flesh
is that alternate rhythm that creates,

464
00:32:02,951 --> 00:32:05,480
generates that peculiar power,
this song.

465
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:11,100
So that's partly why lynching a was such
an issue on everyone's consciousness in

466
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:17,920
the 30s. Um, but there were also
other issues and in fact, the song,

467
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,830
um,
it's a great song,

468
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,080
but it's also slightly misleading in
a sense that it's suggesting that's

469
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:28,770
lynching was strictly a
southern phenomenon, um,

470
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,480
which actually wasn't the case.
Um,

471
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:36,540
and so all we have to do is to look
at this New Yorker cover about March,

472
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,120
1919 38 for,
I laid really very,

473
00:32:41,121 --> 00:32:45,710
very late for this to be on the
New Yorkers cover. This raises, um,

474
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:46,191
you know,

475
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:50,960
just the northern population have been
flabbergasted at how lazy and drunken

476
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,760
blacks are,
um,

477
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:56,330
because they were migrating
in large numbers to the north.

478
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,580
So I'm relatively new phenomenon
in the 20th century, actually.

479
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:06,040
Was there, um, substantial
number of lynchings, uh,

480
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,860
both in the north east and
also, um, in the Midwest.

481
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,510
So this is a kind of very famous,
um, lynching, double lynching,

482
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:19,530
autonomous ship and Aaron
Smith and Indiana in 1938.

483
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:25,400
So once again, very, very late for
that. Um, and it's because of this, um,

484
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,870
Verizon station or a lynching
was in the north, um,

485
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:33,470
that the Anaise ACPA, um, Ashley, um,

486
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
had this,
um,

487
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,480
regular practice of just hanging up
a flag in the New York City office

488
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:45,010
announcing that the man was
still lynch yesterday. Um,

489
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,750
and that was also in the 1930s.
Um,

490
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:51,280
so it was something that
was an ongoing problem, um,

491
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:55,160
and have very much a kind of, um, uh,

492
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:59,340
a hot button issue in the 1930s. So, um,

493
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:02,870
as a consequence of that,
there was an anti lynching bill.

494
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,300
Those trying to make us wait,
uh,

495
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:09,060
through Congress and the Senate
and it passed in the house. Um,

496
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:12,990
but because of the filibuster
filibusters buster Senate,

497
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:17,540
it led to the withdrawal of
the bill in February in 1938.

498
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,530
Um, so, um, it, it, um,

499
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:25,370
it was just something
that just never went away.

500
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:30,380
I mean it was an unresolved issue,
um, all the way through the 1930s.

501
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:30,971
And so having,

502
00:34:30,971 --> 00:34:35,660
we actually was very much plugged into
the politics of the United States when

503
00:34:35,661 --> 00:34:39,470
all of a sudden he would make Ramadan and
suddenly make a reference to lynching.

504
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,310
Um, but just to go back, you know,

505
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:47,320
move away from that history of lynching
in the United States back to his impact,

506
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,450
um, on the Spanish environment. Um,

507
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,200
the response rear and um, and, and,

508
00:34:55,210 --> 00:35:00,050
and pillar two lynching in
another state is once again,

509
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:04,280
very art. As I said, when they lifted
the Negro up for the second time,

510
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:09,490
my mother and pull me away from the
window. So I saw no more children's that.

511
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:14,780
But since I've had had experiences with
demonstrate the drunkenness is the same

512
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,330
in my country,
it is ugly and brutal.

513
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:22,370
You and too young as seven, Maria said
you were too young for such things.

514
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:27,400
I've never seen a negro except in a
circus unless the mowers are Negros.

515
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:32,200
Some of Negroes and some are not pillows
that I can talk to. You have the morals.

516
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:39,210
This is mind boggling that this should
be the response to lynching in the United

517
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,290
States.
Um,

518
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,500
we can't even say that it would be
reassuring to say that it's just cultural

519
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,500
ignorance or the impossibility of cross
cultural understanding that is resulting

520
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,950
in the responses from Maria and polite.

521
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:01,530
It would be nice to be able
to just to say, you know,

522
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:03,750
it's because they don't know
anything about United States,

523
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,280
but I don't even think that that is the
case. Um, so I would invite you, actually,

524
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:10,590
this is something to think about.
You know,

525
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:15,390
why the Spanish always have some weird,
um, and that's putting it mildly.

526
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:20,450
We're responses to violin to
violence a United States period. Um,

527
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:25,760
the response to this and never the right
response is always so off focus that

528
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:29,580
is, you know, it's not even
the wrong response. It's just,

529
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,290
it's just hard to believe that anyone
would respond like that. Um, so, um,

530
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,210
but the, what we see right
there, um, is that this,

531
00:36:39,211 --> 00:36:43,870
once again, we're in vocation of
the Morris in conjunction. Um,

532
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,390
with violence in the United States.

533
00:36:45,391 --> 00:36:49,600
So all we know is that when they
try to make sense of something,

534
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,453
they don't understand.

535
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,730
When the Spanish try to make
sense of something that we
to the more than one. Um,

536
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,730
and the ones who are the people who
come to the mice. Um, so, but it's, is,

537
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,331
is,
is,

538
00:37:00,331 --> 00:37:04,900
is a moment when any kind of community
in between Robert and Marie and color,

539
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:09,510
any previous can chameleon between
them is completely breaking down.

540
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,410
Um, so I just want to, um,

541
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,490
talk about another episode that has
exactly the same kind of structure of

542
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:22,050
incomprehension ignorance and income
comprehension on the positive Spanish.

543
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,370
Um, and this has to do with the
Republican Party. You guys remember that?

544
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:30,960
The leftist in Spain where the Republicans
right there as they're defending the

545
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:31,950
Spanish republic.

546
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,870
So to be Republican in Spain
means that you are on the left.

547
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,050
And this is the context
for that conversation.

548
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,510
My father was Republican Eyes Live, Maria
Sat, it was for that, that they shot him.

549
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,740
My father was also a Republican, always
live. Also my grandfather Robert,

550
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:54,060
is that in what country? The United
States, they should them, the mother,

551
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,210
the woman asked Paver,
Maria said,

552
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,610
the United States is the
country of Republicans.

553
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:03,090
They don't shoot you for being a
Republican. They're all the same.

554
00:38:03,091 --> 00:38:06,180
It is a good thing to have a
grandfather who was a republican.

555
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,550
The woman said it shows a good blood.

556
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,690
My grandfather was on the
Republican National Committee,

557
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,930
Robert Jordan said that impressed even
Maria and it's my father's still active

558
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:21,530
in the republic polo ass. No, he is.

559
00:38:21,531 --> 00:38:23,940
That can one asks how he died.

560
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,230
He shot himself for
avoiding being tortured.

561
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,940
The woman asked yes,

562
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:33,540
or I'll visualize them
to avoid being tortured.

563
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:39,790
So this is where we get that
mix of the comic and the tragic,

564
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,970
it is a comedy of errors so far
for a good part of that passage.

565
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,820
It is accommodated of cross cultural era.
Um,

566
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:53,850
just not being able to wrap your mind
around the fact that to be a Republican

567
00:38:53,981 --> 00:38:58,000
and now this is a very different thing
being a Republican, um, in Spain.

568
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,560
So just not being able to, you
know, this is just a kind of a,

569
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,520
that the permanent blind there is,
um,

570
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,480
in the mind of Maria and pillow.

571
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:12,870
So if that was just the case
and it wouldn't go no further,

572
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,700
um, that would just be a
kind of comic, uh, you know,

573
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:23,170
kind of almost moment with common
relieved, um, in phoned about hose.

574
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,310
Um,

575
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:29,310
but as is always the case with Hemingway
in this particular novel to comics

576
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,340
certainly morphs into something
else without any warning.

577
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,640
So all of a sudden we get into detail
about Raga Jordan's father shooting

578
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,700
himself too for being tortured.

579
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,050
And that can only have only one
meaning for the Spanish. Um,

580
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,030
it fits completely into the person who
history of Maria, if it's completely, um,

581
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:55,570
in two philosophy understanding
of political history in Spain. Um,

582
00:39:55,600 --> 00:40:00,260
but right now we don't know why
his father killed himself, uh,

583
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:02,950
and what kind of torture
he is talking about.

584
00:40:02,951 --> 00:40:07,951
So we have to wait a little longer
to have that mystery clear up for us.

585
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:12,100
Um,
and to have that mystery clear up,

586
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:16,900
we actually have to go through
further into the past. So,

587
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,910
um, I've been talking about this 10
homes in terms to some spatial locations,

588
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:26,280
but this also a distant Tim fro home.
Um,

589
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:31,350
it turns out that the 19th century is
also unnecessary home for Robert Jordan,

590
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,130
especially the civil war.

591
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,760
It's almost the equivalent
of Paris in terms of psych,

592
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:41,460
psychological need for
that home. Um, and it,

593
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:46,210
it's not just any civil war
but his grandfather civil
war and this is his moment

594
00:40:46,211 --> 00:40:49,990
of homecoming. This is the home they
would receive him and shelter him.

595
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:55,390
Remember something concrete and practical.
Remember grandfather's Sabre,

596
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:00,280
Right and well oiled in a standard
scabbard and grandfather show you how the

597
00:41:00,281 --> 00:41:04,540
blade had been thin from the many
times it had been to the grinders.

598
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:07,060
Remember grandfather's Smith and Wesson.

599
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:12,061
It was the single action officers
model when 32 caliber and there was no

600
00:41:12,911 --> 00:41:15,030
trigger. Got It. Had to softer,

601
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:19,060
sweetest trigger for you have ever felt.
And there was always,

602
00:41:19,061 --> 00:41:21,520
well oil and boy was clean,

603
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:26,550
although the finish was all one off and
the bright meadow of the barrel and the

604
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:31,000
cylinder was one smooth from
the letter of the host or, um,

605
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:35,120
so this is like Hemingway's
description of the trout fishing, um,

606
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:40,070
in in our time, very, very clear the
smoothness cleaners of their operation.

607
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:43,410
Um, but in this particular context, um,

608
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,840
the smoothness and the cleaners
and the one alumnis, uh,

609
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:52,670
of that pistol suggest that
this is a well used weapon. Uh,

610
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:56,840
Robert Jordan [inaudible] grandfather
was a hero of the civil war. Um,

611
00:41:56,870 --> 00:42:01,020
his favor had been to the grinders
numerous times because it has been this,

612
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,660
the provide had been so well used.
So without saying anything,

613
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:08,870
without using the word glory or heroic,

614
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:13,750
any comparable adjective,
um, Hemingway gives us the,

615
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,450
um,

616
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:19,450
the sense that the civil war was the
heroic moment was the high point in the

617
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,000
history of Robert's family.

618
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:26,450
And it was very much
vested in his grandfather.

619
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,540
And at that point it has receded.
It has to,

620
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:33,320
it has to be received into the past
is belongs to the 19th century.

621
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:37,850
But Roger that wants to activate it over
and over again bring it up to the 20th

622
00:42:37,851 --> 00:42:42,851
century because he needs that and we know
why he needs to bring the 19th century

623
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:52,030
back on the next page when we
know what happens to that pistol.

624
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:58,360
Then after your father has shot himself
with a pistol and you had come home from

625
00:42:58,521 --> 00:43:00,740
school and they had a funeral,

626
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:04,820
Ricardo had returned it
after the inquest thing. Bob,

627
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:10,310
I guess you might want to keep
the gun. Um, he climbed. Okay.

628
00:43:10,311 --> 00:43:13,730
I should just stop and clarify. That is
something we'll be talking about. Um,

629
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,750
Ashley, the narrative switches from
second person Pronoun, rubber Jordan,

630
00:43:17,751 --> 00:43:21,150
interesting himself as to you.
So that's you is rubber Jordan.

631
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,030
And then it switches back to the person.

632
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:28,410
He climbed out on a rock and leaned
over and saw his face and there's still

633
00:43:28,411 --> 00:43:32,990
water and saw himself holding
the gun and that he dropped it,

634
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:35,780
holding it by the muscle.

635
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:40,730
And so I'd go down making bubbles until
it was just as big as a wash charm in

636
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:43,760
the clear water.
And then it was all the site.

637
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:49,730
So this passage that comes
just on the opposite page,

638
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:50,690
um,

639
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:55,240
from the previous evocation
of the civil war weapons,

640
00:43:55,330 --> 00:44:00,330
the grandfather tells us exactly why
the 19th century in the civil war is

641
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:05,510
unnecessary emotional shelter for Robin.

642
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:09,190
He's just so ashamed of his father.
Um,

643
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:12,890
he wants to clean out that entire episode,

644
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:17,420
drop it into the clear water so
that it will be completely outside.

645
00:44:17,890 --> 00:44:20,480
Um, he can do that too. The pistol,

646
00:44:20,750 --> 00:44:24,110
he can do it to the
actual history is that,

647
00:44:24,111 --> 00:44:28,970
but that's as close as he can
get to wiping out that history.

648
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:33,740
Um, and so in this moment, Ashley, uh,

649
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:38,810
there is no Spanish environment that
is invoked and I think that this is no

650
00:44:40,111 --> 00:44:45,111
mention of the immediate Spanish setting
and I think that that is suggestive as

651
00:44:45,781 --> 00:44:50,280
well. Um, in the sense that
really the homes for Robert,

652
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,290
I think, um, and it's a very
pessimistic reading of the novel.

653
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:00,300
Uh, they basically just two
homes. Robert. One is the Paris,

654
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,670
um, of the, um,

655
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:08,030
evening papers and the chestnut trees
and out the other home for him is a home

656
00:45:08,341 --> 00:45:11,820
that never was a home
that was in his lifetime,

657
00:45:11,821 --> 00:45:16,410
but the home that he can inherit
vicariously through his grandfather.

658
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,030
And that is the American civil
war as his spiritual home,

659
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:26,300
because this is the one place where he
has affirmation of himself that he's not

660
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:30,090
ashamed of himself, not ashamed
of his family history. Um,

661
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,360
and so those are impossible
Homans for them at this spoon.
