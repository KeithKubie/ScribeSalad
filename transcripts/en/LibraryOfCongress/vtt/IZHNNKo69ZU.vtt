00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.260
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.030
&gt;&gt; Robert Salazar: Good
afternoon and welcome

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.110
to the Library of Congress.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.950
Today's presentation, a book
talk about "This Chair Rocks,"

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.930
a manifesto against ageism
by Ashton Applewhite,

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:31.980 position:56%
is presented by the Library's Office

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.900
of Equal Employment Opportunity
and Diversity Programs.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.360
Today's guest, Ashton Applewhite,
didn't set out to become a writer.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.350
She went in to publishing
because she loved to read.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.440
And, according to her, because
she didn't have any better ideas.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.670 position:56%
She had a weakness for the kind of
jokes that make you cringe and burst

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.480
out laughing at the same time.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.740
Her boss kept telling her to write
them down and the collection turned

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.960
into the bestselling
paperback of 1982.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.890
She was a clue on the
television game show "Jeopardy."

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.470
Who is the author of
truly tasteless jokes?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.640
The answer?

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.940
Blanche Knott.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.240
Her pseudonym.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.840
And, as Blanche, she made
publishing history by occupying 4

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.410
of the 15 spots on the "New
York Times" bestseller list.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.810
The first woman to ever do
so, if I'm not mistaken.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.110
First person?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.190
Incredibly impressive.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.040
Her first serious book,
"Cutting Loose,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.590
Why Women Who End Their Marriages
Do So Well," was published

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.260
by Harper Collins in 1997.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.890 position:56%
"Ms. Magazine" named it or called it
rocket fuel for launching new lives.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.880
Since 2000 she has been on
staff at the American Museum

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.950
of Natural History where she writes
about everything under the sun.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.010
The catalyst for "This Chair
Rocks" was puzzlement, as she says.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.620
Why is our view of late
life so [inaudible] grim

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.410
when the lived reality
is so different?

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.810
She began blogging about aging and
ageism in 2007 and started speaking

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.360
on the subject in July
of 2012 which is also

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.090
when she started her blog
"Yo, Is This Ageist?"

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.800
During that time she has
become a Knight Fellow,

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.460
a "New York Times" fellow,
a fellow at Yale law school.

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.570
And she has written for
"Harper's," "Playboy,"

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.700
and many other publications.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.210
And she has been recognized
by the "New York Times,"

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.810
National Public Radio
and the American Society

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.780
on Aging as an expert on ageism.

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.230
Her book, "This Chair Rocks,"
a manifesto against ageism,

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.840
was published earlier
this year in March.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.510
Ladies and gentlemen, please help
me in welcoming the wonderfully

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:07.630 position:56%
and honestly humorous and
incredible author Ashton Applewhite.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.630
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Thank you.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.730 position:56%
I never -- I never open with my full
bio except I was going to today,

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.210
but then Robert beat me
to it because I was going

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.260
to tell my unorthodox
literary career starting

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.890
with all the publishing
companies that turned down

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:29.430
"Truly Tasteless Jokes" before
it was a phenomenon, well before.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.150 position:56%
It was called "What's the Difference
Between Garbage and a Girl

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.410
from New Jersey, the
Book of Tasteless Jokes."

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.750
And my two favorite declined notes.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:40.040
Simon and Schuster
said, "Publish this?

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.680
We can't even Xerox this."

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.740
And Viking Penguin said,
"If we publish this,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.660
the little bird would have to hide
its head under its wing in shame."

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.890
But then Ballantine
published it and it went

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:55.160
on to make publishing
history of a sort.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.530
I -- This isn't in the bio.

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.630
I am responsible for "The New York
Times" bestseller list introducing

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.470
the other and how to category
because Barbara Tuchman

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.030
and other fancy schmancy
editors at Random House felt

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.940
that Blanche was besmirching
the bestseller list

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:12.640
and they invented a
separate category.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.980
That is true.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.670
And so then Harper Collins
published my divorce book

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.290
and then 20 years later I
wrote -- I don't like writing.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.170
I like the thinking part,
but not the writing part.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.710
So I wrote this and submitted
it to Harper Collins.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.820
And they turned it down because no
one else was writing about this.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.980 position:56%
And a lot of other publishers turned
it down and I didn't want to sell it

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.830
for a little bit of money so
I ended up self publishing.

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.780
So this is a self published book.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:44.670
And I just want to
tip by hat to Roberto

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.470
because you could have
knocked me over with a feather.

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.800
There was a profile of me in
the "Washington Post" that some

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.100
of you may have seen and that's --

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.380
He told me today that
that's what he saw.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.780
But that was just a few weeks.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.410
The book was just three weeks old.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.650
So thank you everything, Library
of Congress, for taking a chance

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.410
on a book that no one had
heard of which is getting

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.000
out there in a really nice way.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.060
The reason I wrote this
book in hindsight was

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.400 position:56%
because I was afraid of getting old.

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.410
And I didn't know that
was the reason,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.810
but I started a project inspired
by my mother-in-law who was

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:21.110
in her eighties at the time.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:22.410
And she said, "Why
don't you write --

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.210
" She's a bookseller,
she and her husband.

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.610
And she said, "Why don't you write

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.880
about something people
ask us all the time?

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.140
So when are you going to retire?"

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.300
So I thought, "Well,
that's catchy and it's,

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.240
you know, upbeat and optimistic."

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.140
And the blog at the
time, the first one,

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.980
was called
sowhenareyougoingtoretire.com.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.060
And I started interviewing people
in their eighties and nineties

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.710 position:56%
who were working and they were
amazing and they were a dime a dozen

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.720
which -- neither of
which surprise me.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:52.760
But I also started reading and
researching about longevity.

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.800
And what I learned so soon and
so easily just knocked me over.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.730
I mean again and again.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.930
Like, for example, I
thought the odds of ending

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.890
up in a nursing home were,
you know, pretty good.

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:09.190 position:56%
And it turns out that the percentage
of the American population over 65

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.730
in nursing homes is
4%, down from 5%.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.580
It's dropping steadily.

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:18.940 position:56%
And that people were happiest at the
beginnings and ends of their lives.

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.800 position:56%
It's called the U curve of happiness

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.550
and it's incredibly well
substantiated independent

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.460
of class all around the world.

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:28.140
The older people get,
the less afraid of dying.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:32.030
I mean I won't bore you with more
statistics, but I just thought,

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:34.910
"Why don't people know this stuff?"

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.800 position:56%
And we don't know it because we live
in a culture that drowns out all

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.960
but the negative about
life after 65.

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.970
And the reason behind
that writ large is

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:51.250
because if aging is a problem then
they can sell you stuff to fix it.

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:55.390
And if aging is a disease then
they can sell you stuff to cure it.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.710
And it's not curable.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:58.010
It's not fixable.

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:59.430
It's not a problem.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.730
It's not a disease.

00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:04.730
It's a natural, powerful
lifelong process.

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.440
And I wanted to tell that story.

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.390
And of course then suggest
that we call out the voices

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.580
that frame it as decline alone.

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.800
So I'm going to start with
a definition of ageism.

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.170
The formal definition
is discrimination

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.650
and stereotyping on
the basis of age.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:29.620 position:56%
And we're ageist whenever we behave
towards someone or think differently

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:34.090
about a person or a group on the
basis of how old we think they are.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.740
And it's not a household world or
a sexy one, but neither was sexism

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.800
until the women's movement turned
it into a howl for equal rights.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.380
And, as with all ism, stereotyping
lies at the heart of ageism,

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:49.760
the assumption that all
members of a group are the same.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.930
It's why people think everyone in
a retirement home is the same age.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.690
That would be, "Old."

00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:57.510
Even though residents
can range from people

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.230
in their fifties to centenarians.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:00.530
So imagine.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.360
Can you imagine anyone
thinking that way

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.040
about a group of people
from 20 to 60?

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.160 position:56%
Right? And the older we get the more
different from one another we become

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:14.050
because we age at different rates,
physically, socially, cognitively.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:19.330 position:56%
So that's why doctors say if you've
seen one 80 year old you've seen one

00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.580
80 year old.

00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:26.250
Like racism and sexism, ageism
is a socially constructed idea

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.260
that has changed over time
and that serves a social

00:08:29.260 --> 00:08:31.310
and economic purpose.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:33.120
It's not about how we look.

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.480
It's about how people in power
assign meaning to how we look.

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.670
And unless we challenge
stigma, we reproduce it.

00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:44.520
We experience ageism any time
someone assumes we're too old

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.820
for something.

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:47.160
A task. A relationship.

00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.460
A haircut.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.400
Instead of finding out who we
are and what we're capable of.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.340
Or if someone assumes
we're too young.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.550 position:56%
Ageism cuts both ways as when people
complain about lazy millennials or,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.710
say, "Kids are like that."

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.110
Now I see ageism everywhere.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.280
When old pals cringe
at public mention

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.130
of how long they've
known each other.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:09.510
That's my old pal Judy
[inaudible] me her in ninth grade.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.650
Instead of savoring
their shared history.

00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:13.110
&gt;&gt; And what year was that in?

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:16.120
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Oh,
you're going to make me do math?

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:18.420
I was 15. Can I just
say how old I am?

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.720
That's easier.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:23.260
I'm 64. When men and women
feel compelled to lie

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:26.070
about their age on
online dating sites.

00:09:26.070 --> 00:09:29.640
When people bridle at being
kindly offered a seat on the bus.

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:33.360
On billboards, on television,
in hospitals and hotels,

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.400
over dinner and on the subway.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.700
"At age 80, who doesn't
need a facelift?"

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:41.130
A poster announcing a subway
station renovation asked brightly.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:43.040
That was on the [inaudible]
New York where I live.

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:47.450
In the incessant barrage of
messages from every quarter

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:51.480
that consigns the no longer
young to the margins of society.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.330
In our mindless absorption of
these messages and numb collusion

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:58.770
in our own disenfranchisement,
I've learned that most

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:02.040
of what I thought I knew about
the aging process was wrong.

00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.460
That staying in the dark serves
powerful, commercial, and medical,

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.560
and political interests
that don't serve mine.

00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:12.320
And that seeing clearly
is healthier and happier.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:16.560
So my instructions are to be wonky.

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.490
I'll start out being wonky and
if I'm too wonky you can --

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:23.270
So here's really interesting
information

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:27.690
which really surprised
me when I learned it

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:32.460
that links ageist stereotypes to
our physical and mental health,

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.520
that actually attitudes towards
aging affect how our minds

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.010
and bodies function
at the cellular level.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.850
A growing body of fascinating
research documents the link

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:45.980 position:56%
between people's perceptions of
aging and their health and behavior.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:49.230
Yale psychologist Becca Levy
has been measuring the effect

00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:52.080
of age stereotypes
for close to 20 years.

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.970
Over and over she and her
colleagues have found that people

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.960
with more positive feelings
about aging behave differently

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.380
as they age compared
to those convinced

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:04.320
that growing old means
becoming useless or helpless.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:07.250 position:56%
Long term studies show that
positive attitudes towards aging are

00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:10.950
associated with better functional
health and more predictive

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:16.910
of health status than socioeconomic
status or race or gender.

00:11:16.910 --> 00:11:19.170
That's really interesting, right?

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:20.510
Implicit interventions.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.860
Flashing positive age stereotypes
in the form of words like active

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:26.070
and creative on a screen so briefly

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:30.360 position:56%
that you just absorb it subliminally
improved not just self perception,

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.070 position:56%
but physical functions like balance.

00:11:33.070 --> 00:11:36.990
People with more positive views of
aging do better on memory tests.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.630
They have better handwriting
which correlates with good health.

00:11:39.630 --> 00:11:41.600
And they can walk faster.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.370
And they recover more fully

00:11:43.370 --> 00:11:46.930
from complete disability,
severe disability.

00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.280
And they live longer and not
just a little bit longer,

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.090
an average of seven and
a half years longer.

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:55.600
Those unable to overcome a
lifetime of internalized ageism,

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.840
on the other hand, were less
likely to seek healthcare

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.850
or to exercise, and died earlier.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:06.010
A goal of public health and aging
policy is more healthy years,

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:08.280
not years without health.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.970
Imagine the benefits to
health and human potential

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:16.160
of overturning ageist stereotypes
before they distort self image,

00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:19.300
shorten steps and limit prospects.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.380
Think what overturning
ageist stereotypes would do

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:28.430 position:56%
to extend not just the lifespan, but
the health span of all Americans.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:30.800
There will be -- I'm going to
leave plenty of time for a Q

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:34.870
and A after this because there's
also really interesting data

00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:39.380
about attitudes towards
aging and cognitive function.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:41.890
So feel free to ask me about that.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:46.210 position:56%
And also -- And my favorite study in
this vein was they took two groups

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:48.880
of college students and with
one they did the same flashing

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:52.540
of messages with words
like -- I love the choice.

00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:55.390
Florida and bingo were
two of the words.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.430
And then with the other group
they either used neutral messages

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:00.730
or positive messages.

00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:04.880
And what they measured in the
test was the fact that the group

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.650
of college kids that had received
the negative messages subliminally

00:13:08.650 --> 00:13:13.050
walked to the elevator more
slowly than the other group.

00:13:13.050 --> 00:13:15.220
And those, you know --
Those are 18 year olds.

00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:20.150
So imagine we get a lifetime of
messages about, you know, debility

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:22.390
and other, you know, ugly
things, what that does --

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:25.190
To the point at which they do
actually have the potential

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:30.740
to become self fulfilling
stereotypes.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:36.550
Okay. The -- So how about the myth
that older workers take jobs away

00:13:36.550 --> 00:13:40.060
from younger ones which is a
fallacy called the lump of labor

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.470
that economists have
debunked countless times?

00:13:43.470 --> 00:13:44.880
When older workers stick around,

00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.980
it does affect the upward
mobility of younger workers.

00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.230 position:56%
It is not easy to balance legitimate
seniority, the greater knowledge

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:55.200
and experience of older workers,
with the ambition of younger ones

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.150
to rise through the ranks.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.290
Instead of working toward
equitable solutions, though,

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:03.940
companies exploit the problem by
pitting older and younger employees

00:14:03.940 --> 00:14:07.670
against each other as early
twentieth century manufacturers did

00:14:07.670 --> 00:14:11.540
with workers of different races
or nationalities and as Walmart

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.740
and Amazon do today with
union and non union employees.

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.770
In an ageist and capitalist society
where corporate profits come first,

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.400
those tactics go unchallenged.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.040
The problem is structural

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:27.860
which these tactics
deflect attention away from.

00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:31.150
High unemployment rates aren't
a too many old people problem.

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:33.700
They're a labor market problem.

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:36.050
The amount and nature
of work is not fixed.

00:14:36.050 --> 00:14:38.190
Otherwise the expansion
of the female workforce

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:40.600
in the twentieth century would have
put hoards of men on the streets,

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:42.920
for example, but it didn't.

00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:48.010
If the job market is strong, a big
if, workers of all ages benefit.

00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.600
Having more salaries
generates more tax revenue.

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.560
Seasoned talent is valuable.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:55.150 position:56%
And it's not a zero sum proposition.

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.490
Older people are job creators.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:01.460
According to a 2012 Pew
charitable trust report, quote,

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:04.660
"Evidence suggests that grater
employment of older persons leads

00:15:04.660 --> 00:15:07.300
to better outcomes for the young.

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.690
Reduced unemployment.

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:09.990
Increased employment.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:11.370
And higher wages."

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:14.860
Unquote. It's not only that
older workers don't crowd

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.160
out younger ones.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.770
They also increase employment
among the young in many ways.

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:22.150 position:56%
As bigger earners, they can buy
more products produced by the young.

00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.530
They may be business owners
who employee younger workers.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:28.370
And of course they pass
along valuable skills.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:31.530
An aging population also means
unprecedented opportunities

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:33.280
for innovative kinds of jobs

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.870
that involve intergenerational
collaboration.

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:39.160
Older workers are typically
better at seeing the big picture

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:42.040
and can draw on institutional
knowledge, especially in a joint

00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.770
like this, I bet, while youngers
likely have an edge when it comes

00:15:45.770 --> 00:15:49.300
to seeing what's new and
integrating technology.

00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:53.160
Pitting workers against each other
also fails the common sense test.

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.720
It's not as though our lives

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:58.680
and financial obligations are
contained by generational moats.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:00.150
Children inherit.

00:16:00.150 --> 00:16:03.920
Grandparents exhaust their
savings or help with tuitions.

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.760
A Social Security check
makes everyone

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.600
in the household more
financially secure.

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.030
People with steady incomes
help unemployed family

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:13.170
and friends stay afloat.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:20.560
Independent of age and biology,
tribes and networks support us all.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:25.360
And now a little rant about
one of my least favorite terms

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.560
which is agelessness which you
see being touted, you know.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.320
All sorts of things are
just going to keep ageless.

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.690
Like anti-aging, I'm not
going to read the bit.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.740
There's a wonderful British
writer named Anne Karpf

00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:39.880
who wrote a terrific
book called "How to Age."

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.890
And, you know, aging is living.

00:16:41.890 --> 00:16:43.190
Living is aging.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:47.950
So think about that when a product
touts its anti-aging properties.

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:53.650
And she said, "You can no more be
anti-aging than anti-breathing."

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.830
So offering neutral
ground, an end run,

00:16:56.830 --> 00:17:00.280
around all these messy
ambiguities, agelessness sounds

00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:02.190
so seductive, doesn't it?

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:06.490 position:56%
On a tube of eye cream agelessness
promises to erase the trace of time.

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.390
In pop culture it describes
people who stay young

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:11.530
in their fifties and sixties.

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.010
In gerontology it suggests

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:17.060
that a youthful spirit can remain
unaltered within an aging body.

00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:21.000
None of these scenarios is
possible and they're all ageist.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.880
As sociology Molly
Andrews has argued, quote,

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:27.300
"The current tendency towards
agelessness is itself a form

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:29.830
of ageism, depriving the old of one

00:17:29.830 --> 00:17:31.800
of their most hard
earned resources."

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.030
Their age or years, right?

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.150
Rather, this is agefullness,

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.210
an accretion of all the
things we've done and been.

00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:43.710
Not catalogued or curated,
but stored random access

00:17:43.710 --> 00:17:47.540
within our bones and brains
that makes us who we are.

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:48.920
Hag. Spinster.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.720
Crone. Old fogy.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.140
Old fart. Old goat.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.440
Little old lady.

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.740
Dirty old man.

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.040
Sweet old thing.

00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.340
Geezer. Biddy.

00:17:57.340 --> 00:17:58.640
Codger. Fogy.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:03.220
Coot. These stereotypes are ours
to reject or subvert on the way

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:06.970
to more compelling and accurate
aspirational identities.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.050
At the moment I'm leaning
toward hag,

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:13.120
something a driver actually
called me last year when I banged

00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:15.130
on the trunk of his
car after he bombed

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:17.050
through the pedestrian crosswalk.

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:20.340 position:56%
Hag. Outside of Shakespeare, really?

00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:25.360
Maybe it was my funny fake
fur cat hat that undid him.

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.400
I wish I were young again.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.660
People say this all the time.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.950 position:56%
When pressed, however, few would
actually move their game pieces back

00:18:32.950 --> 00:18:34.250
to the beginning of the board

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:37.710
or anywhere close unless they
could transport their present day

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:40.480
consciousness back in time as well.

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.780
Adolescence again?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.110
No thanks, even though I'd get
to have more time with Judy.

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:49.350
I'd love my 18 year old cartilage
back, but I dance more now

00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:52.980
because I'm less self conscious
and I prioritize better.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:56.540
Whatever our trajectories,
however we've navigated loving

00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.900
and letting go, whether children
or houses or dreams, we are the sum

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.800
of those experiences and
what we learn from them.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.530
They make us us.

00:19:05.530 --> 00:19:10.830
That is agefullness, rich
and deep and invaluable.

00:19:10.830 --> 00:19:19.190
So this is from a section
called "What Makes it

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:22.260
So Hard to Ask for Help?"

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:24.920
In this country no myth
is more powerful than that

00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.140
of rugged individualism,
the notion that success

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.100
and independence are
paired and that relying

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.770
on others signals not just physical
frailty, but weakness of character.

00:19:34.770 --> 00:19:38.520
That myth serves us poorly,
especially people with disabilities

00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.950
and older people, to
increasing overlapping circles

00:19:41.950 --> 00:19:44.300
in the Venn diagram of life.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.410
Dignity and freedom of choice are
and remain critically important,

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:52.320
of course, yet the way we grow
old is governed by a whole range

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:56.580
of variables, including
environment, personality and genes,

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.490
compounded by class, gender,
race, luck and the churnings

00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:06.440
of the global economy over which
we have varying degrees of control.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.640
What happens when we
can't hoist a big suitcase

00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.830
in to the luggage rack anymore or
drive at night or drive at all?

00:20:13.830 --> 00:20:15.950
When we can't hear the
instructions anymore

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.200
or read the directions
or understand them?

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.250
When we can no longer
make it to the bathroom

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.690
or even heave ourselves out of bed?

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.950
A culture that idealizes self
reliance amplifies those anxieties

00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:32.290
and silences questions about
the structures that strand us.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:34.210
Where's the low luggage rack?

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:38.760
Why no large print or audio
assist or person to ask?

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.240
Why should diapers at the end

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.930
of life be any more shameful
than at the beginning?

00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:46.660
This culture demands
optimism without end,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:49.270
downplays life's challenges
and shames us

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.640
when inevitably we fall short.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.710
This ethic of individualism serves
the proponents of small government

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.010
who conveniently ignore
the role of services paid

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:02.610
for by their fellow citizens
in making many of them wealthy.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:06.650
This ethic has systematically
eroded communitarian values

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:10.090 position:56%
and sanctioned the U.S. government's
abdication of responsibility

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:12.010
for its vulnerable citizens.

00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:14.540
The effects can be seen in
decades of concerted efforts

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.040
to shrink the wealthier state

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.970
and public assistance programs
even though exactly the opposite is

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:23.920 position:56%
called for if the country is to meet
the enormous challenge of caring

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.400
for its older citizens
in the years to come.

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:32.050 position:56%
As long as those challenges are ours
to shoulder alone, there's no point

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:35.990
in addressing or even identifying
any of the larger factors

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.520
that make it hard for people

00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.990
to navigate the transitions
of late life.

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:44.700
Consider the terrible story
of the Crabtree family.

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:49.230
Jim Crabtree's wife developed
early onset Alzheimer's at age 56.

00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:51.270
For six years Crabtree's
parents were able

00:21:51.270 --> 00:21:52.970
to watch her during the day,

00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:56.240
but his 84 year old dad was
experiencing cognitive problems

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.830
and his mother, 80, suffered
from severe arthritis.

00:21:59.830 --> 00:22:03.900
In May 2013 Crabtree's
father shot both women

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.300
and himself while his
son was at work.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.430
Crabtree told NBC's Maria
Shriver that it was a great gift

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.390
from his father since it,
quote, "Ended my Alzheimer's

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:15.410
and elder care issues at once."

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:18.320
And since the three who
died were all ready to go.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.010
He loved them, you know.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.930
He was devastated, but
that's how he saw it.

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:27.930
NBC's only comment was
that care giving is tough.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:30.080
What does that say
about our society?

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.450
Imagine an alternative scenario.

00:22:32.450 --> 00:22:35.720
Decent, affordable healthcare,
subsidized care giving,

00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:39.280
and help from a team of social
workers, friends and neighbors.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.310
That support would
have gone a long way

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:46.330
to help Jim Crabtree's family cope
and spare them this horrific end.

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:49.960
His mother's only illness
was arthritis.

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:53.410 position:56%
Stories like these have even healthy
middle aged people wondering whether

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:58.030
suicide or, say, triple murder
will be the ethical alternative

00:22:58.030 --> 00:22:59.920
to asking for help.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.890
These are lethal forms
of internalized ageism

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:06.610
and they handily serve the American
government's twenty-first century

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.450
austerity program.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:11.410
I just imagine this like lightening
bolt coming over from the capital

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:14.380
and like smiting me at the lectern.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:18.200
But got to smite back.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:19.900
And let's see.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.390
Just one more.

00:23:23.390 --> 00:23:26.190
The call to action.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:28.970
Although we age in different
ways and at different rates,

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:31.120
everyone wakes up a day older.

00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.680
Aging is difficult, but few
of us opt out and the passage

00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:38.220
of time confers very
real benefits upon us.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:41.450
By blinding us to those benefits
and heightening our fears,

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:43.200
ageism makes growing older

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:47.120
in America far harder
than it has to be.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.040
That's why I've embarked
on a crusade

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.250
to overturn American culture's dumb

00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:54.370
and destructive obsession
with youth.

00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.800
As I've gone on this journey
from the person to the political,

00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.280
it's become clear that
ageism is woven deeply

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.020 position:56%
in to our capitalist system and
that upending it will involve social

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.490
and political upheaval.

00:24:06.490 --> 00:24:09.720
Ageism, unlike aging,
is not inevitable.

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:12.860
In the twentieth century
the women's movement

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.230
and the civil rights movements
woke mainstream America

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:19.060
up to entrenched systems
of racism and sexism.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:24.850
And a digression here is that all
change starts inside each of us

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.240
and that's why the tool

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:29.250
that catalyzed the women's
movement was consciousness raising.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:34.240
Women came together and compared
notes and realized in the process

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.170
that issues that they had been
thinking were personal problems,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:40.480
whether it was, you know, not being
respected at work or, you know,

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.400
tying it all to their
material status in the world,

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.480
that this was -- that these
were not personal problems.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.130
These were widely shared
political problems

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:51.170
that required collective action.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:54.400 position:56%
And that's, you know -- All of us --
You know, getting older is not easy.

00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:56.900
There are real challenges and
we need to deal with them.

00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:59.070
But the way it's framed in
the culture now is, you know,

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.870
"You're not doing a
good enough job."

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:04.490
Or, "It's your fault if you can't
-- " You know, if you have wrinkles

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:08.820
or you can't, you know, date --
find someone to date or whatever.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.750
And while those are our problems,

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:13.580
they are widely shared
political problems also.

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:16.420
Right? So we need to come
together and talk about that

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.590
and mobilize against
them as a group.

00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:22.000
More recently disability
rights and gay rights

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.490
and trans rights activists have
brought ableism and homophobia

00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:28.690
and transphobia to the
streets and the courts of law.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:32.950
It is high time to add ageism
to the roster, to include age

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:35.460
in our criteria for diversity.

00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.410
Duh. And to mobilize against
discrimination on the basis of age.

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:43.000
It is as unacceptable as
discrimination on the basis

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.980
of any aspect of ourselves
other than our characters.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:50.650
If marriage equality is here
to stay, why not age equality?

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.300
If gay pride has gone
mainstream and millions

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.550
of Americans now proudly
identify as disabled,

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:59.590
which is an amazing transition
in this society where physical

00:25:59.590 --> 00:26:04.040
and cognitive perfection are
so prized, why not age pride?

00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:06.670
Right? Aging is an accomplishment.

00:26:06.670 --> 00:26:09.140
The only reason that
idea sounds outlandish is

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.510
because this is the first
time you've encountered it.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.140
It won't be the last.

00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.910
Longevity is here to stay.

00:26:14.910 --> 00:26:16.680
Everyone is aging.

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.990
And ending ageism benefits us all.

00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:23.420
This book is a call to wake up
to the ageism in and around us,

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.400
embrace a more nuanced
and accurate view

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:29.160
of growing older, cheer
up and push back.

00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:31.590
What ideas about aging have
each of us internalized

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.710
without even realizing it?

00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:38.010
Where have those ideas come from
and what purpose do they serve?

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:41.740
How do they play out across our
lives, from office to bedroom,

00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:45.720
in muscle, in memory, and what
changes inside us once we perceive

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:48.250
these destructive forces at work?

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.120
What might an age friendly world,

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:53.250
friendly to all ages,
that is, look like?

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:56.070
What can we do individually
and collectively

00:26:56.070 --> 00:26:58.790
to provoke the necessary
shift in consciousness

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:02.350
and catalyze a radical age
movement to make it happen?

00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:03.830
I hope you will join me.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.630
Thank you.

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:12.200
[ Applause ]

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.420
Uh oh.

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.420
&gt;&gt; Congratulations
on the great turnout.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.720
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Thank you.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:24.580
&gt;&gt; I have to say that I'm
in charge of a senior and --

00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.800
aging and senior culture
area of studies

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.100
and professional organization.

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.400
We can talk later.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:32.810
And I have a good -- you know,

00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:34.950
a good challenge in
getting people to --

00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:36.250
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Yeah.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:37.550
People think aging --

00:27:37.550 --> 00:27:39.330
&gt;&gt; Not sexy, but you're
making it sexy.

00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.920
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Thank you.

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.220
&gt;&gt; Okay. And I'm so glad.

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:48.770
I'm so glad that you're [inaudible]
how you think of ageism mostly

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:53.460 position:56%
with older people and of course
maybe the prejudice is mostly there.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:55.100
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: We
are all in this together.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:56.630
Everyone was young.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:57.930
Everyone's going to get old.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:27:59.230
&gt;&gt; But okay.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:01.890
And everybody goes
through different ages,

00:28:01.890 --> 00:28:05.210
but I can't escape the
age cohort that I'm in.

00:28:05.210 --> 00:28:06.860
I'm a Baby Boomer like you are

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.270
and I don't think I have
all those characteristics.

00:28:10.270 --> 00:28:14.310
And how injurious are
these gen X categories,

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:16.560
millennial categories and so on?

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.620
And silent generation.

00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:19.920
Thank god.

00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:21.790
I know people from the silent
generation who are anything but.

00:28:21.790 --> 00:28:23.090
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Shocker.

00:28:23.090 --> 00:28:26.000
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so I mean,
you know [inaudible]

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.300
so that's how they [inaudible].

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.960
How injurious are those?

00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.080
How useful are those terms
and how do we combat them?

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.410
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: They're -- I
mean they're useful demographically

00:28:33.410 --> 00:28:36.270
and obviously, you
know, I too use them,

00:28:36.270 --> 00:28:42.070
but you know if any generalization
about an individual on the basis

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:47.260
of their age is, you know,
inherently problematic and if,

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.900
you know, stereotypes are always
wrong, but especially in the case

00:28:50.900 --> 00:28:54.410
of age because the older we are the
more different from one another --

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:56.700
So obviously a tribute,
a characteristic,

00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.410
to an entire generation is
absurd, although clearly there are,

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:03.600
you know -- We listened to
the same music growing up

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.280
and there are certain -- I mean
there are certain legitimate,

00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.080
you know, characteristics
that can be attributed to us.

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.710
The bigger problem with it, though,
and it is something I touched

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:18.140
on in the work thing, is that it
is an attempt to frame the issue

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:22.060
in terms of scarcity, in terms of
zero sum, in terms of conflict.

00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:26.340
And as long as it's old versus
young -- And it's bee, you know --

00:29:26.340 --> 00:29:28.090
This thinking has been debunked

00:29:28.090 --> 00:29:30.420
in countless fields
by countless experts.

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:34.820
It pits us against each other
and deflects our attention away

00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.570 position:56%
from the actual issue whether in
the workforce it's that, you know --

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:39.360
It's the way the job
market is structured.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.830
In care giving I don't
want to be stuck with,

00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:43.750
you know, caring for old people.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.370
I mean there's -- So that's
the problem with it really is

00:29:47.370 --> 00:29:49.460
that implicit in it
is the assumption

00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:51.880
that the generations are
pitted against each other.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:54.210
And we really need
to think radically

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.210
in the broadest possible terms
about how to meet the challenge

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:01.770
of an aging population because of
course the people who are now 20,

00:30:01.770 --> 00:30:05.120 position:56%
30, 40 are going to benefit from it.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.420
Here's another example.

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:09.040
It's why I say all age friendly.

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.490
You know, when they frame it as
we have to do this expensive stuff

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.440
to help poor pathetic old
people get up the stairs,

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:16.880
ramps also help people on crutches.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.830 position:56%
Ramps also help women with strollers
and men with strollers and people

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.010
on skateboards and -- Right?

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.490
So this -- And ditto
in the workforce.

00:30:25.490 --> 00:30:29.460
You know, flex time and
making buildings accessible --

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:33.530
People of all ages and anyone
trying to balance work life,

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.740
anyone with any kind of care
giving responsibilities, yes,

00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:41.500
those accommodations benefit
older workers disproportionately,

00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:44.440
but they also benefit
people of all ages.

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.770
So really try and push back.

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.120
Oh, and here's another thought.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.420
Sorry. Really long answer.

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:54.240
But when we think of it in
generational terms it's --

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:58.590
We often talk about allocating
resources by age and you see this

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.390
around healthcare all the time.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:02.970
We have enough money to
help newborns, but you know,

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:05.390
whey does that old guy need
a sixteenth hip replacement?

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:07.510
Well, you know, if
they botch my first 15,

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:09.270
I'd like a crack at the 16th.

00:31:09.270 --> 00:31:11.920
I would. But here's
the larger point.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:15.350
Don't get sucked in to that
argument like I just did.

00:31:15.350 --> 00:31:20.350
We no longer accept the idea
of allocating resources by race

00:31:20.350 --> 00:31:25.310
or by sex and it is no -- not any
more acceptable to do it by age.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:30.930
Period. Yes?

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.610 position:56%
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] is that I'm realizing
as someone who sits all day

00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.830
at my job that I'm
not even as mobile

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.130
as my 80 year old [inaudible].

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.060
So [inaudible] when you're
talking about ramps and all that.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.550
I feel like I'm going to
need all these things.

00:31:46.550 --> 00:31:47.850
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite:
You probably will.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.150
We all will.

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I was wondering, using the terms,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:55.280
do you think with the
Baby Boomers aging --

00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.260
Will that get more people involved
in the cause to help the rest

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.220
of us coming behind them?

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.750
Because like when I [inaudible]
and saw all the old people still

00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:12.760 position:56%
with their families, getting
around, I was like we don't do that.

00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:18.800
But then if my dad [inaudible] I
would have to be taking care of him

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.250
and trying to go to work.

00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.550
So.

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:24.220
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: I mean that
is a colossal, colossal question.

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:25.520
You know, of course.

00:32:25.520 --> 00:32:27.850
And one -- I mean when
I was floundering,

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:31.780
which I was for a long time,
trying to figure out what my way

00:32:31.780 --> 00:32:34.440 position:56%
through this topic was, at one point
I woke up in the middle of the night

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.820
and bought the domain
name botharetrue.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:38.120
Seriously.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.580
Because you can argue, you know,
with regard to the Baby Boom,

00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:44.280
you know, the good news is I think
most of us are getting old enough

00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:47.710
to realize we're actually
going to get old.

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:49.910
And some of us will be radicalized.

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.550
And I'm really hoping
that those of us who --

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:56.120 position:56%
You know, I grew up in D.C. and I
remember, you know, the big marches,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:58.020 position:56%
the -- You know, the anti war stuff.

00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.870
So -- And people a little older.

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:02.530
I missed part of the
women's movement,

00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.300
but my talks are almost
always attended by more women

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:08.610
and I think there's a lot of
women who learned about sexism

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:10.890
and who can apply what
they learned to ageism.

00:33:10.890 --> 00:33:15.050
So I'm hoping, you
know, that we mobilize.

00:33:15.050 --> 00:33:18.760
On the other hand, there is, you
know -- The counter force is, oh,

00:33:18.760 --> 00:33:20.060
well, we're Baby Boomers.

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:21.360
We're special.

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.660
We're healthier than ever.

00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:26.050
We are -- You know,
we are somehow exempt.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:31.090
And that if we, you know, eat
more sushi, do more, you know,

00:33:31.090 --> 00:33:33.310
sit ups, we can escape it.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:38.310 position:56%
And that is age denial and that's
what a lot of the -- Or I mean okay.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.840
AARP. Thunderbolt.

00:33:39.840 --> 00:33:42.320
But you know that is their message.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:44.250
You know, there's no gray
hair in their magazine.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:45.890
There's no talk about disability.

00:33:45.890 --> 00:33:48.590
There's no talk about
people over 70.

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:52.150
You know? And we need to embrace
the whole kit and caboodle.

00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:55.680
We need to do it, you know,
from the full age spectrum.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:58.660
So, you know, when you go to
Honduras, see what works there

00:33:58.660 --> 00:34:01.670
and see what you can do
to bring it about even

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.420
in just your family
life or your community.

00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.160
And I mean there's a ton of energy.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.170
Yes. The short answer
to your question is yes,

00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:11.920
because the Baby Boomers are aging
a ton of resources are pouring in.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.220
Some of them progressive.

00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.970
And some of them just
looking to make money.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:19.470
I mean now that federal prisons
can't be for profit anymore,

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:20.980
guess what those guys
are investing in?

00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:25.710
For profit nursing
homes, for example.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:32.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; So in terms of ideas for building
their movement and action plan,

00:34:32.950 --> 00:34:38.340 position:56%
it seems one of the reasons that
this may be more urgent than ever is

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:44.810
because the supreme court basically
eviscerated the older worker's act

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:47.950
and legalized age discrimination.

00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:49.830
So where the actual points?

00:34:49.830 --> 00:34:56.470
Who are the people who are working
on building the movement and,

00:34:56.470 --> 00:35:00.380
you know, what would be the next
step in terms of building that?

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:02.300
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: I've
never built a movement before.

00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:07.450
There are -- I mean
I'm speaking tomorrow

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.390
at a conference called The Positive
Aging -- Positive Aging Conference.

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:14.860
&gt;&gt; It's an international
conference on positive aging.

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.160
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: There we go.

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.460
Thank you.

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:19.200
It's at the capital hill

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.940
and I'm sure you could
show up if you wanted.

00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.600
I mean I met a fellow from
London just before I came

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.970
down who started this group

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.060
with a colleague called
The Age of No Retirement.

00:35:28.060 --> 00:35:32.650
There are lots and lots of people
coming together on this and one

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:34.560
of the ideas -- And there's
going to be a meeting at part

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:37.080
of the positive aging thing,
a sort of smaller meeting,

00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.150
sponsored by the National
Council on Aging

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:41.290
to answer exactly that question.

00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:46.780
I will throw it back at you to say
if you know anything about this,

00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:48.600
do what you can to make it happen.

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.920
It's going to take all of
us and, you know -- And I --

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:54.420
Sorry to sound like a shill, but
I really urge you to get people

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.000
to read my book because
it's really persuasive.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.740
Indeed you have [inaudible]
attending the conference.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.040
So.

00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:02.340
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] Ashton's
book, and I --

00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:03.640
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Oh, god.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:04.940
I didn't pay her to say this.

00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:07.850
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] public never met
her before, is that for all of us

00:36:07.850 --> 00:36:11.500
who are working out there -- I'm an
elder care anarchist and when I say

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.300
that everybody goes, "Gasp."

00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:15.530
But, you know, you have all
these grassroots people,

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.450
all these people who have a vision.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:21.980
But because of you being gutsy
enough to sit there and say, "Hey,

00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.180
I didn't get a publisher and
this has to be published,"

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:28.380
you've created a focal point.

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.460
You created a gathering point.

00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:33.230
And I'm trying to remember the
name of the group in New York.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.530
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Oh,
the radical age movement?

00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.550
Yeah. I mean that's
another grassroots thing.

00:36:36.550 --> 00:36:40.950
But I mean I'm one focal point,
but this is my proxy, you know.

00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:42.680
There's thousands of those.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.800
And so I don't want
to be the focal point.

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:47.750
I want there to be
10,000 focal points

00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:49.340 position:56%
and honestly I don't know what form.

00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:50.840
I mean I know some
stuff that we need.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:52.310
I mean we need clearing houses.

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:54.150
We need an association.

00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:55.450
But it is really happening.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:36:59.470
Yes. In the back corner.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:01.090
And then the woman in front of you.

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.800
You in the blue shirt?

00:37:02.800 --> 00:37:04.100
Yes.

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.400
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:07.550
I'm just wondering what your
research has shown about, you know,

00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:09.730
sort of I think a common fear

00:37:09.730 --> 00:37:14.720
of getting older is
dementia and Alzheimer's.

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.620
What can you say about that?

00:37:16.620 --> 00:37:19.380
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Well, for
one thing, no one knows that rates

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:22.980
of Alzheimer's have
dropped precipitously

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:24.770
in the last few decades.

00:37:24.770 --> 00:37:27.660
The absolute number of people
with Alzheimer's is growing

00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:29.900
because the percentage of
people of the population

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:31.820
who are old is larger,
but the chances

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:35.070
of any one individual
getting Alzheimer's have

00:37:35.070 --> 00:37:36.810
diminished significantly.

00:37:36.810 --> 00:37:41.830
So the real epidemic is anxiety
over memory loss which you hear.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:43.130
And every time -- I mean I used

00:37:43.130 --> 00:37:45.850
to think senior moment quips
were kind of cute, you know.

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:47.790
They were self deprecating.

00:37:47.790 --> 00:37:51.040
And then finally it dawned on
me that when I lost the car keys

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:55.210
in high school I didn't
call it a junior moment.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.780
And that every time you make
a joke like that you reinforce

00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.340
to whoever you're making
it to, and to yourself,

00:38:01.340 --> 00:38:04.440
that cognitive decline
inevitably accompanies aging.

00:38:04.440 --> 00:38:08.280
20% of the population escapes
cognitive decline entirely.

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.180
We all know some of those
super sharp 90 year olds.

00:38:11.180 --> 00:38:14.590
Right? Most of us will lose
some processing function,

00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.600
especially the thing where
you can't remember the name

00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.520
of the movie you saw with
what's her name at that place.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:25.110
But the main picture is most of
us don't lose much more than that.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:28.420
You know? It's just like -- And
the physical decline is inevitable,

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:32.830
but most of us remain able to do
some version of the things we love.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.750
The really interesting
thing about Alzheimer's is

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:38.700
that there are a bunch
of long term studies

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.060
and results keep coming in now.

00:38:41.060 --> 00:38:43.740
When people die they autopsy them.

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:45.140 position:56%
The brains of the some of the people

00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:48.560
who were completely
sharp were filled

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.950
with Alzheimer's type [inaudible]
and what those people had

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:57.370
in common is a sense of purpose,
a positive attitude towards aging.

00:38:57.370 --> 00:38:59.330
So, you know, this ties back

00:38:59.330 --> 00:39:01.320
to what I think is a
really compelling argument.

00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.030
So anyone out there in public
health or who knows anyone

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:08.140
in public health, an
anti ageism campaign

00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:13.520
as a public health initiative
is a really smart idea.

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:14.820
And -- Because if you --

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:17.720
I mean what's the main obstacle
to having a purpose in late life?

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.590
Structural discrimination
that sidelines older people.

00:39:21.590 --> 00:39:22.890
So let's work on that.

00:39:22.890 --> 00:39:25.200
And I hope that answered your
question and now the woman there.

00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:29.380
Yes. Can you speak any louder?

00:39:29.380 --> 00:39:32.600
&gt;&gt; I was listening to something
the other day on the news

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:40.470
and you can tell that healthcare
is really starting to discriminate

00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:45.420
against getting older because in
a lot of states now [inaudible]

00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:48.680
because of that they don't
[inaudible] the thing

00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:50.570
that Medicare and -- Medicare.

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:55.890
And so you have all these issues
where now you have to almost look

00:39:55.890 --> 00:40:00.190
at what state you go
to for your healthcare

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.480
because your particular
insurance company may be pulling

00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:04.280
out of that piece.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.760
So then you're going to get
discriminated against because --

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.030
with healthcare because
that has created --

00:40:12.030 --> 00:40:15.910
A really great thing about
the preexisting conditions.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:22.460
And so you have to almost look at
what state you retire in to look

00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:28.180
at the healthcare system and
what insurance company --

00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:29.480
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Yeah.

00:40:29.480 --> 00:40:30.780
It's a problem.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:32.080
You and then you and then you.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.380
So -- But the gentleman
in the corner.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.930
&gt;&gt; In terms of coalition building,
I wonder if you heard the term TAB.

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:38.360
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite:
Temporarily able bodied?

00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.070
&gt;&gt; Yeah. Offered by the disability
community just to remind people

00:40:41.070 --> 00:40:42.890
that it's a normal part of life.

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:44.190
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Yeah.

00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:47.170
I mean we have a ton to learn from
the disability rights movement.

00:40:47.170 --> 00:40:50.820
And their fantastic motto which
is "Nothing about us without us."

00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:53.140
And make sure that
in every group you're

00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:57.900
in that there is age diversity as
well as other types of diversity.

00:40:57.900 --> 00:40:59.200
Yes.

00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:00.580
&gt;&gt; I thought it was
kind of interesting

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.840 position:56%
because last year I was comparing --

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.890
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Temporarily
able bodied is what people

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:09.110
with disabilities call
the rest of us.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.410
Sorry.

00:41:10.410 --> 00:41:13.600
&gt;&gt; I was comparing long term
health insurance policies

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:19.400
and an insurance company agent came
to our house and said the number

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:24.070
of -- the reason for long
term health insurance is

00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:28.080
because of dementia or
Alzheimer's [inaudible].

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:30.370
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite:
50% or so of the people

00:41:30.370 --> 00:41:33.530
in nursing homes do have
advanced dementia, higher maybe.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:36.150
&gt;&gt; And so she said,
"So if you decide

00:41:36.150 --> 00:41:40.710
to take this particular policy,
it's likely you'll get a call

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.160
from the insurance company and in

00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:46.000
that call they ask you some
questions and at the end

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.700
of the call they'll see
if you have any -- "

00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:51.160
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: If you
remember who you're talking to.

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.640
&gt;&gt; Right. But so I got the call

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.670
and the first question was what
was today's date and that --

00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:59.820
Like every single day I
look at my phone or --

00:41:59.820 --> 00:42:01.390
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: I never
know what today's [laughs].

00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:04.110
&gt;&gt; What day it is until I --
You know, or can't remember.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:06.900
But I've been doing that all
the time so I thought, "Gee,

00:42:06.900 --> 00:42:08.200
I hope I get the insurance."

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:11.220
Because, you know -- But anyway.

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:13.710
But that's what they said,
that the number one reason

00:42:13.710 --> 00:42:16.200
for long term healthcare --

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.500
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: That's true.

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.650
Funny you should say because I just
applied for long term healthcare

00:42:19.650 --> 00:42:22.650
and they did the whole
thing and they did the quiz.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:26.550
And they turned me down
because I have osteoporosis.

00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:29.070
Yeah. Right?

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:30.710
That's -- What was [laughs].

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:32.960
I mean and I sort of
tried to appeal.

00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:35.980
It's like, "This really puts me
at risk of institutional care?"

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.610
I know. I'm going to try and figure
out how to make noise about it.

00:42:39.610 --> 00:42:41.070
Yes?

00:42:41.070 --> 00:42:43.160
&gt;&gt; Hi. I'm Kate [inaudible].

00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:44.460
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Oh, hi Kate.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.050
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] we are a global
organization that's looking

00:42:48.050 --> 00:42:52.240
at the issue of aging
all around the world.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:43:02.370 position:56%
But I wanted to just touch on the
thing about a public health campaign

00:43:02.370 --> 00:43:07.110
on ageism because you're in luck.

00:43:07.110 --> 00:43:13.740
The national day of older persons
[inaudible] is on October 1st.

00:43:19.350 --> 00:43:23.270
The theme this year is a theme
on ageism and countering ageism.

00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:26.810
The folks [inaudible] through
the World Health Organization,

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:31.350
but different organizations
around the world

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:33.660
that will be kind of
carrying this theme.

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:36.040
And we'll be doing
something here in the U.S.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.340
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Yeah.

00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.640
It's the theme for
the United Nations

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.540
and I'm giving the
keynote at the UN.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:41.840
Did you know that?

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:43.140
Yeah. Thank you.

00:43:43.140 --> 00:43:44.440
It really -- But -- And what I'm --

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:49.590 position:56%
I'm trying to think if I can get
away with the title there, you know.

00:43:49.590 --> 00:43:52.300
Confront ageism or
the rest is noise.

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.490
I probably need to do something
a little less in your face.

00:43:55.490 --> 00:43:58.510
But it's really true that whether
you have expertise in Medicare

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:02.870
or nursing home administration or
housing policy or workforce policy,

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:05.840
if we don't look inside
between our ears at our own --

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.390
you know, the ways in
which we are ageist sort

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.690
of counter intuitively -- Right?

00:44:09.690 --> 00:44:11.940
Not for evidence that we're
not, but at the prejudice

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.650
that we have all internalized
over a lifetime.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:22.550
I catch myself saying and
thinking ageist stuff all the time.

00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:25.720
It's ongoing and we haven't
had any counter messages

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:30.680
in the culture until
really recently.

00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.120
But -- So that's essential.

00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.290
And then whatever field
of expertise you have --

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:40.170
And then once you start to see it,

00:44:40.170 --> 00:44:47.560
it's like a genie getting
out of the bottle.

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:53.490
You see it everywhere.

00:44:53.490 --> 00:44:59.210
And then you can bring
that awareness

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.890
to whatever your expertise is.

00:45:01.890 --> 00:45:07.360
If we don't take that initial
step, all we do is Band-Aids.

00:45:07.360 --> 00:45:11.570
We really just do short fixes

00:45:11.570 --> 00:45:16.130
without addressing the
structural discrimination.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:21.770
You know, you can eat all the sushi
you want if you can afford it.

00:45:21.770 --> 00:45:29.170
But it doesn't help the fact
that you can't get a job.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:32.520
You know? That shit
is discrimination.

00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.820
You and then you.

00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:36.950
&gt;&gt; I'm just curious because
thinking about comparing ageism

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:44.000
to all the other isms I come
from a marketing background

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:50.380
so the biggest thing is, you know,
having other people who aren't

00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.060
in your group understand
your experience

00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:58.090
or that they care about
your movement too.

00:45:58.090 --> 00:46:04.160
The main thing about ageism is
that everybody has the experience.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:09.240
So I'm just wondering if you
have thought about that at all

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:13.870
and maybe it's kind of touching on
your -- I forget the term you used,

00:46:13.870 --> 00:46:16.190
but aging indifference or --

00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:18.560
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite:
Old person in training?

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:24.390
&gt;&gt; Well, it's just like in denial.

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:25.690
Aging denial.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:29.290 position:56%
Is there aging denial that's keeping
people from really embracing --

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:33.320
Because it's not like it's just
helping this small group of people.

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:34.770
It's everybody hopefully.

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:36.070
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: Right.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:39.150
I mean age -- Age denial is
the heart of the problem.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:41.830
As long as we pretend we're
not getting older, you know.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.230
And then, you know we celebrate
the ability to change and adapt

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.490
through life until we
hit late middle age

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:56.980
and then suddenly the goal
becomes to like put on the brakes

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:01.080
and have everything stay the
same which is, A, crazy, and B,

00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:04.410 position:56%
not doable, and, you know, punitive.

00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:10.820
The weird thing about ageism is
that of course is affects everyone.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:14.680
And I -- It's really important
I think always to point out.

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.710
Of course it disproportionately
affects older people,

00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:20.480
but it also affects
young people, you know.

00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:23.170
It's really hard to be in your
twenties and one of the things

00:47:23.170 --> 00:47:26.400 position:56%
that makes it harder is this
message like, "Peak life right now."

00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:33.200
If you're not, you know, building
that career and having awesome sex

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:37.280
with someone really beautiful
every night, downhill from here.

00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.270
So, you know, I mean that sucks.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:40.920
And that is ageism.

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:43.210
So it's really important to point

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.550
out that these forces
affect our whole life.

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.650
And another way I've been
thinking about it a lot, and I --

00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:50.740
is that this whole idea of --

00:47:50.740 --> 00:47:53.900
you know, that diversity
is important I think is

00:47:53.900 --> 00:47:55.240
critically important.

00:47:55.240 --> 00:48:00.220
And so is this idea of, big
word alert, intersectionality

00:48:00.220 --> 00:48:04.880
which was a word that came
out of black feminist studies

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:11.060
which when a scholar named Kimberle
Crenshaw realized that racism --

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:14.670
The civil rights movement
didn't address gender issues.

00:48:14.670 --> 00:48:17.020
The women's movement wasn't
addressing race issues.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:22.660
Well, all these forms of oppression
intersect and reinforce each other.

00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:27.220
So at the UN we're going to
be calling for a convention

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.540
on the rights of older people.

00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:32.400
And what I want to say is, you
know, there is already a convention

00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.560
on the rights of women,
on the rights of children,

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.590
on the rights of people
with disabilities.

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:41.280
If you [inaudible] a convention on
the rights of other people, you --

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.730
Most older people are women.

00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.440
It affects children too.

00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.530
And we, many of us,
age in to disability.

00:48:48.530 --> 00:48:53.660
So when we combat ageism, you know,
we make the world a better place

00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:57.060
to be female and to a be a
person of color and to be,

00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:58.780
you know, all those other things.

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:02.220
So I think -- Does that
answer your question?

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:05.270
I think that's the meta
message is it does affect you.

00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:06.570
It affects you now.

00:49:06.570 --> 00:49:08.610
And whatever your personal
issue happens to be,

00:49:08.610 --> 00:49:13.270
there's a way in which it is --
I mean, you know, are the people

00:49:13.270 --> 00:49:15.600
in your movement of all ages?

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:16.900
You know, is one thing to look at.

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:18.200
And who was -- Yes.

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:19.500
&gt;&gt; You had mentioned
earlier that the numbers

00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.800
of Alzheimer's patients
has gone down.

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.100 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: The incidence.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:23.400
They don't know.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.700
They don't know why.

00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.000
And so other things.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.300
Like there was a big -- It was a
big piece in the "New York Times"

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.600
about the incidence of old age.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:29.900
It's on my Facebook page which is
This Chair Rocks Facebook page.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.200 position:56%
And -- Oh, and I should say it's
available in all electronic editions

00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.500
and in an audio book read by me.

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.800
But if you -- But I put a ton

00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.100
of interesting research
up on my Facebook page.

00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.400
Also my blog is
thischairrocks.com/blog

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.700
or you can just go to it.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.000
And all my research is
searchable so it's all there.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.300
You can write me.

00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.600
Ashtonapplewhite at
Gmail or I'm easy to find

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:42.900
since I'm the only
person with my weird name.

00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:44.200
And also there's a
free downloadable guide

00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.500
to starting a consciousness
raising group around age bias

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:46.800 position:56%
which is how I met my friend Alberto
who lives here called, "Who, Me?

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:48.100
Ageist?" And it draws
on, you know, the --

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:49.400
sort of the way the women's
groups were structured.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:50.700
And gives questions
and resources also.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.000
Yes. Okay.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.300
How are we doing?

00:49:53.300 --> 00:49:54.600
Last question.

00:49:54.600 --> 00:49:55.900
&gt;&gt; I'm very impressed
with your eloquence

00:49:55.900 --> 00:49:57.200
and I was wondering what is
your educational background.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:58.500
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: It's
even lamer and weirder

00:49:58.500 --> 00:49:59.800
than my [inaudible] publishing.

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:01.100
I'm under educated.

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:02.400
I have no degrees.

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:03.700
Well, I did go to the National
Cathedral School for Girls

00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.000
which was hideous, but
I learned to write.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.300
I wanted to do my homework.

00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:07.600
I learned to focus.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.900
And then I went to
the Kirkland College

00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:10.200
which is the coordinate
college at Hamilton

00:50:10.200 --> 00:50:11.500
which got eaten by Hamilton.

00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.800
And that's all the school I had.

00:50:12.800 --> 00:50:14.100
I'm a completely auto whatever.

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:15.400
&gt;&gt; DIY.

00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.700
&gt;&gt; Ashton Applewhite: DIY.

00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:18.000
Autodidact.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.300
Kind of. Yeah.

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.600
Thank you all for coming.

00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:21.900
I hope -- I'll be over there.

00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:23.200
Thank you.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:24.500
&gt;&gt; Robert Salazar: Please take
advantage of the opportunity

00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:25.800
to purchase your book for
$18 and Ashton will sign it.

00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.100
Plus here I've got another
round of applause for you.

00:50:27.100 --> 00:50:28.400
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
