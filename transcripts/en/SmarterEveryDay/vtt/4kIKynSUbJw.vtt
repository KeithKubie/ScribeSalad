[Rushing waves]

00:00:14.937 --> 00:00:18.473
Hey it's me, Destin. We're in the Gulf
of Mexico and we're about to go fishing.

00:00:18.498 --> 00:00:20.798
And I'm gonna beat all
these guys at fishing.

00:00:20.823 --> 00:00:23.030
- It's not gonna happen.
- It's not gonna be me.

00:00:23.848 --> 00:00:25.327
(Destin) Alright ladies,
how're we doing over here?

00:00:25.352 --> 00:00:27.154
- Look at our basket and see
how we're doing over here.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.361
- ...Caught triggerfish.
(Destin) Triggerfish?

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:32.221
- I caught 'im.
(Destin) You caught it?

00:00:32.793 --> 00:00:35.393
So the reason they call it
a triggerfish is because

00:00:35.418 --> 00:00:38.602
you have to pull a trigger in order
to get the dorsal fin to go down.

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:43.539
(Destin) Ah!

00:00:44.104 --> 00:00:46.551
(Destin) Okay, if you ask me
it is awesome anytime there's

00:00:46.576 --> 00:00:49.622
some type of mechanical
device built into an animal.

00:00:49.647 --> 00:00:51.704
Well that's just the case
with the triggerfish.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:54.822
The front dorsal fin is a
spine that locks in position.

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:58.213
It cannot be folded down until the
rear one is folded backwards,

00:00:58.238 --> 00:01:00.174
just like pulling a trigger on a gun.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.726
Now, this is good for two reasons:

00:01:01.751 --> 00:01:04.440
The first reason is a triggerfish
likes to hide in a hole,

00:01:04.465 --> 00:01:06.516
and it'll lock the front dorsal fin.

00:01:06.541 --> 00:01:10.487
No predator can get it out unless
it chooses to unlock itself

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:13.396
Secondly, if a predator tries
to eat the triggerfish

00:01:13.421 --> 00:01:16.939
The huge dorsal fin on the front will
rip its insides apart, killing it.

00:01:16.964 --> 00:01:19.608
So, it's a build in defense mechanism.

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:20.975
[Cocking sound effect]

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.819
