00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.960
So in the Greek times people were very interested in regular polygons, and in geometry. It was the dawn of geometry, really

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.040
And they wanted to construct as many polygons as they could

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.560
But regular, all the sides are the same length all the angles the same

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.460
They where very interested in constructions with ruler and compass alone.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.480
Here's a good compass

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.300
Ruler meant just a straight edge

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.680
No markings on it at all. This one has markings but I'm gonna use it anyway. I won't use the markings.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.940
Here's a nice circle, drawn with a compass, in the old style

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.400
So if I pick a point in the circle, I'm gonna draw a hexagon

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.820
In a way that everybody will know, who has ever played with ruler and compass

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.620
I'm keeping the compass length the same as it was for the original circle. Oops, ran out of ink there

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:56.140
There we are. 
But the ink is so satisfying  to me that I don't mind the splodges occasionally

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.420
All the circles pass very nicely trough the center, showing that I haven't changed the width of the compass

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.420
And now I have six marked points on the circumference of the circle

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.420
And if I want to I can put lines through them and I'll get a beautiful regular hexagon

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.120
Make the lines longer looks even nicer

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.600
Ruler and compass constructions are something else.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.800
There we are, a beautiful hexagon.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.080
And of course if I just connected three of the points, like these three, I would get a regular triangle.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.760
If I have any line, I can divide it in half with ruler and compass alone.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.050
Think that's worth doing just to show
how it's done. I'm gonna use it a lot later.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.150
So suppose I have line and suppose I have a couple points that were already marked on it

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.220
and I want to construct the midpoint of
that segment and a

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.840
perpendicular line through the mid point.
I can do that with my ruler and compass

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.920
And I make some pieces of a circle on each side

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.520
and I look at the places where this circle meets them

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.540
and then if I connect those two points
those two new marked points

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.900
I get a perfect perpendicular bisector of this segment.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.600
So the the ancients knew how to do a triangle and a hexagon the way I did it.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.800
They knew how to do a square 'cos you can make these perpendicular lines and that makes it easy to do squares.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.360
They knew how to do a pentagon. That's a little more complicated

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.080
and that's all they knew. They could put
three and five together to get a fifteen-gon too

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.340
but for instance you know what's the
next number we know how to do 3, 4, 5

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.640
6, 7 right, can you do seven?

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.300
No one could say. And they asked can we do this? Is it possible to construct a 7-gon

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.510
or a 9-gon, or anything else anything else at all

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.040
other than the ones you can get by taking
three

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.100
or five or three times five, or dividing

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.180
those things by two you can divide again
and again by two just the way I did here

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.850
to get like a 30-gon or a 60-gon that's all easy

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.600
once you have a 15-gon. It was an
open problem from antiquity

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.430
for two thousand years people played
with the ruler and compass and

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.910
worried about that and then something
amazing happened it got connected

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.860
with the rest of mathematics that often happens in mathematics when, when a problem gets

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.580
connected to something else it becomes
accessible

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.630
actually this fell to a prodigy, a pimply
19-year-old

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.030
Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1796

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.020
what he did initially was just to prove
that you could construct

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.290
regular 17-gon with ruler and compass

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.830
and later on he'd analyze the problem
completely and

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.450
and said exactly what you can construct
I'm gonna do the construction for you

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.560
that Gauss proved it was possible but if I really
do it with a ruler and compass

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.660
then you'll be very disappointed because
it won't work

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:00.980
and that's just because the little
errors that I make along the way, there are

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.920
are so many little constructions to make
they're all the same

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.489
and they're all really easy but by the
time you're finished the errors have all built up

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.550
and so I might construct a 15-gon [instead of a] 17-gon

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.210
there's my circle so I wanna ... I would like to
construct a regular 17-gon in that circle

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:21.739
so here goes the first thing I'm gonna do
is to draw

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.530
a diameter. So the next step will be to
construct

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.600
a perpendicular bisector of this diameter. Maybe I'll do one

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.800
one such construction just so I'm not
cheating completely

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.840
I know where one point is already the center, so I don't have to draw that

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.080
then the other. I guess I want it to go on fro a while.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.070
Okay you know I can divide things in half with ruler and compass so I'm gonna divide them in half

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.890
and I'm just going to do it by eyeball. We
could do it with ruler and compass

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.570
but it gets tedious after a while.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.460
And then I want to divide each of these segments in half too

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.020
That's a half, and maybe that's a half, like
that

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.229
and then I get a draw another line

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.130
do that with that the real ruler through
the quarter mark

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.030
and then I'm going to do something
surprising

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.330
I'm gonna draw a circle which has this radius

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:21.530
this is half the length of the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.580
radius. This radius and based at that
point on this intersection

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.900
this quarter mark (a little more ink in there)

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.200
get it in the hole, and I'll draw this semi-cirle.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.290
Now I'm gonna draw a couple more lines. This construction is a lot of lines and it's really quite easy.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.000
Brady: Do you enjoy this?
Prof: I love it I love it

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.490
I don't know why but its like origami or something

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:56.640
it's very very precise craft stuff and it does something beautiful.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.720
Gonna draw that line

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.880
I'm gonna draw this line. I'm gonna divide them both
in quarters too.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.320
So you know I can do that, I'm gonna do it by
eyeball again

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:14.200
you know I could. So I want that quarter and I want this quarter

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:22.500
and I want this one, there's a half, and this one

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:27.190
Alright, and now I'm gonna draw some more lines
through this

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.260
point of intersection and through
those two new

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.790
points and I'm interested in where they
meet this line down here

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.050
there's a fundamental point that's gonna be
useful to me

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.130
and then another

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:47.229
okay so now I have these two important
points

00:06:47.229 --> 00:06:51.199
on this line marked and I'm gonna draw

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:54.370
I'm gonna do something funny, I'm gonna bisect
this segment

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.180
from this point to the edge it's about
here but we'll

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.819
hmm, maybe I'll do that accurately
because this is important

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.120
and I'm gonna draw a circle whose

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.259
centre's at that midpoint and whose radius is this

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.919
it'll be inside the circle like that. I'm interested in this point, by the way, where my circle meets this line.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:21.940
And I'm gonna draw a tiny little circle around

00:07:21.949 --> 00:07:25.580
the center point with radius this
little distance here

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:40.620
So now I have another circle and what I want is the line joins them there

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.979
and now I'm gonna draw a circle

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:47.020
which is centered at this funny point and

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:50.940
this radius so one more circle we're
almost done

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.270
almost there
Brady: you still enjoying it?

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:00.759
Prof: I'm getting a little tired of it to tell you the truth
then draw that circle

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:04.229
and the crucial thing is where it meets this line
there

00:08:04.229 --> 00:08:08.080
okay now we are ready

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:12.810
you might say well where's the ... where's
the 17-gon

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.860
and I have to draw out

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.310
a perpendicular to this diameter

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:23.830
which meets at that point and another one here
so I'm gonna draw a line here

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:28.130
and a line here. 
Should I eyeball it or should I do it for real?

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.810
If I had little more energy at this point

00:08:32.810 --> 00:08:35.890
I'd use the compass, but what I'm
interested in anyway is this point

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:40.310
and corresponding point here

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:45.500
now you might if you're looking really hard
you might say

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:51.320
that's not a 17th of the circle and in
fact it's 2 17ths of the circle

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:54.510
Or it would be if I had done everything exactly right

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:57.850
so I have one more division to do

00:08:57.850 --> 00:09:01.410
I draw this line I divide it in half

00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:05.320
and I get a point about here

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:09.360
I would say that's the point and now

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:13.680
I have my 17th of a circle, finally.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.020
By drawing this radius

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:22.920
One radius, and two radius

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:27.600
So this distance, from here to here, is supposed to be a 17th

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.910
of the circle. Now just for fun

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.120
and you may have to go off camera for this Brady

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.320
let's see how how close I came 
Brady: (laughing) alright

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:47.700
Prof: now I would say I didn't get quite halfway between 'cos I estimated that too

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.540
... three ...

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.760
... nine ...

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.120
... ten ...

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:59.100
there's another

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.670
and another, well, gee, I'm

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.010
it seems it's close to a multiple, and a last one.

00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:14.010
Brady: what did you make? What -gon have you made?
Prof: Let's see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.580
16, 17, 18, 19, 20

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:24.390
21 so I made a 21-gon by accident

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:27.530
an impossibility so it went wrong
because

00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:31.970
its I think probably not even a
numerically stable procedure even if I'd

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.300
tried to use the compass at every time

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:38.970
and done it as accurately as I could.
By the time I made all those divisions

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:43.210
things little errors would have built up
and it would have come out wrong one way or another

00:10:43.459 --> 00:10:49.819
but um its provably the right thing if
you were exactly right

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:53.649
let's see how'm I doing?

00:10:53.649 --> 00:11:00.649
so this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15

00:11:02.759 --> 00:11:08.839
Here's 16

00:11:08.839 --> 00:11:13.339
and then since it's a 17-gon maybe it should connect this way

00:11:13.339 --> 00:11:17.850
Brady: (laughing)
Prof: not quite a regular 17-gon but

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:24.850
what can you do?

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.300
we used to have the address 1000
Centennial Drive

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.900
because really we are actually a small
access road, Gauss way,

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:39.760
and Centennial Drive is the big road that's
nearby and

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.480
well was not a problem for us but it was
a big problem for our neighbors

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.010
our neighbors are the Silver space lab

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.610
and they build satellite experiments for NASA and so
these big big trucks would come rumbling

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.960
along with some delivery

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:57.600
or to pick up an experiment and there was
no 1000 Centennial Drive

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.100
so they would rumble right on by

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:02.650
and that was a continual source of trouble for them

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.320
so they finally convinced the University
of California Berkeley which is

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.570
the one who owns the land to
name the access road

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:14.470
and they had some idea that I didn't
much like for naming it after a double

00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.970
star whose colors were blue and gold

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:21.840
I forget the name the star actually and I
thought astronomers might know that but

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.640
mathematicians won't know it won't mean
anything so I went to them

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:30.080
it is said to my colleague maybe we should
name it after some famous scientist and

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:33.020
Gauss would be perfect because he was both
a mathematician

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:36.920
and he ran the ducal Observatory

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.940
in the town where he was, so he would be
... he was very important in astronomy actually too

00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:45.650
and my colleague at the time said oh you
know

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.790
you think he was an astronomer but the
astronomers will never heard of him

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.890
and I went over to the director the
space lab and I said you know

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.160
think we oughta name it after some famous
scientist, how about Gauss?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.800
he looked at me kinda surprised he said
oh, was Gauss a mathematician?

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.930
so that was a done deal right away

00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:08.340
and then they were very generous they
said okay

00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:11.690
you you been nice to us you can have
number one

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:15.540
and I said no we don't want number one
we want number seventeen

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.140
because that represents Gauss's first
big splash as a mathematician

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:25.400
and we very much about youth in mathematics and the success of post-docs and things like that

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:29.840
cultivating young talent so we got to be
17 Gauss way

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.920
and on our front doors instead a number

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.760
we put the construction the 17-gon that I've just showed you.
