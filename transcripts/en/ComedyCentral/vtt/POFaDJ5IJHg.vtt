WHATEVER THIS RELIGION IS,

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:29.263
THIS NEEDS--
EVERYONE NEEDS TO KNOW THIS.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.965

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:33.967

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:40.841
AND I HAVE--
MY WIFE IS GOING TO SPEAK

00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:44.778
YOUR MOTHER'S WORDS
THROUGH HANDWRITING.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:45.812
REALLY?

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.614
HOUDINI,
SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

00:00:47.648 --> 00:00:49.283
JUST QUIET DOWN.

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.686
I KNOW YOU'RE SKEPTICAL.
LET'S JUST DO THIS.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.889

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR--

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:58.325

00:00:58.358 --> 00:01:02.262
YAY! WE'RE ALL HERE.
WE'RE DOING THIS SEANCE.

00:01:02.296 --> 00:01:05.299
LET'S SPEAK
TO HOUDINI'S MOTHER.

00:01:05.332 --> 00:01:07.067
SO THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.136
OH!

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.306
MY SON, I'M SO HAPPY
TO SPEAK TO YOU!

00:01:12.339 --> 00:01:14.708
OH, THIS IS SO WONDERFUL!

00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:19.479
OH, THANK GOD FOR YOU
AND SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE!

00:01:19.513 --> 00:01:20.848
MR. SHERLOCK--

00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:23.417
OKAY, WELL, MOTHER, UM...

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.552
CAN YOU READ MY MIND?

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.788
[laughs]
OF COURSE!

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:30.390
I'VE ALWAYS READ
MY SON'S MIND.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.593
THIS IS--THIS IS GREAT!

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:35.429
UH, UM, YES.
[wand clatters]

00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:37.731
I--SORRY
I DROPPED THAT WAND.

00:01:37.764 --> 00:01:40.501
BUT YES, I'M GONNA PUT
A CROSS ON TOP OF THIS THING.

00:01:40.534 --> 00:01:43.637
SHE WROTE A CROSS
ON THE TOP OF THE THING.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.306
MRS. HOUDINI WAS JEWISH.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.643
AFTER SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
AND HIS WIFE

00:01:49.676 --> 00:01:54.781
[bleep]ED HIM OVER,
HE REALIZED THAT...

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:57.518
WHO HE--
ONE, TWO, THREE--

00:01:57.551 --> 00:02:00.087
HE--HE BECAME ANGRY.
HE'S LIKE, [bleep]!

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.658
I'M GOING TO FALSIFY
EVERY [bleep]ING SPIRITUALIST

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:05.726
THAT I COME ACROSS.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:05.826
HOUDINI WOULD GO AROUND
IN DISGUISE
