00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
&gt;&gt; I think India does have the capacity to
become a superpower.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.019
First of all, it is by far the largest country
within its own region.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.219
It has the capacity that sort of to play a
dominant regional role and

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.230
having a regional base from which to be a
global power is vital.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.991
China has the because within East Asia, the
United States has a base

00:00:22.991 --> 00:00:26.990
within its hemisphere, and traditionally Britain
and France had bases

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.350
within their hemispheres.
So this is very important.

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.520
Secondly, its size and its resources, its
human resources, also its

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.050
material resources, give it the capacity to
really take advantage of a

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.760
market power.
Part of what makes America a superpower is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.760
that people want access to
its market.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:48.800
People want our influence by its level of
worth.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.629
And over time by unlocking the potential of
its people, India can

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.090
achieve that kind of economic superpower base
without which it's very

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.380
hard to be a world power.
Ultimately, you've got to make a choice to

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.600
invest in defense to be a
superpower.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.650
And I know the Indian government is making
several steps in this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310
direction.
But over time, that's something that has to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.480
be sustained in order that
for a superpower status United States to be

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.590
retained.
To create and antibodies and reactions from

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.491
your neighbors which carry
a price and Indian government have to make

00:01:21.491 --> 00:01:24.539
its choice.
The final point I think would be about a system

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.549
of government.
To be a superpower, you need to have a strong

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:33.509
capacity to get power
from a strong, central political base.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.409
The United States, although like India federally
very split, has been

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.429
able to centralize power with its foreign
policy issues around the

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:47.689
President.
So the Congress is very powerful but it is

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.340
more powerful on domestic
issues than it is on foreign issues.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.420
That's a big question is whether India will
develop a similar type of

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.159
political structure with a center and really
play a active role in

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:05.090
foreign policy, while probably still being
very federal and divided in

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:11.090
some cases in its domestic policy.
