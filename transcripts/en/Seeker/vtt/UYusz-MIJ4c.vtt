00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.520
This is Titan, Saturn’s largest moon.

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.090
Though it’s 800 million miles from our planet,
it’s actually one of the most Earth-like

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.400
places in the solar system with a topography
full of oceans and lakes.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.510
And NASA has a crazy plan to send a space
submarine to explore it.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.680
But we’ll come back to that.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.680
Titan is larger in size than Mercury and is
the only world beyond Earth and Venus with

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.130
a dense atmosphere, which is why it’s often
dubbed Planet Wannabe.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.879
Within its atmosphere are a curious assortment
of clouds, including some made of noxious

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.030
compounds like hydrogen cyanide and benzene
and monstrous ice clouds that form in its

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.420
south pole.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.600
These help scientists investigate Titan’s
weather patterns, which could impact the landing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.719
of a futuristic space sub.

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.670
Unlike Earth, Titan’s incredibly thick atmosphere
is actually full of nitrogen and methane instead

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.739
of oxygen, which creates its glow.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.719
The orange haze kept Titan shrouded in mystery
for years, until NASA sent Cassini to peer

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.789
through it in 2004.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.610
Cassini made more than 100 fly bys of Titan
and eventually sent a probe dubbed Huygens

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.680
onto its surface.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.800
While en route, two imaging instruments collected
data and infrared photos of Titan’s surface,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.630
which is what you’re looking at right now.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.940
Huygens’ view gave NASA scientists their
first look at the mysterious moon.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.970
And what got NASA really excited is that Cassini
and Huygens images revealed that Titan has

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.020
lakes and seas filled with hydrocarbons like
methane and ethane, instead of H2O.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.340
These were the first leaks to be discovered
beyond Earth.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.760
Even more curious, if life exists on Titan,
it could have a completely different biochemistry

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.290
than life on our planet.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.960
Which means, methane based life forms.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.920
Or life as we don’t know it.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.180
And Titan’s cryogenic seas could hold clues
of life, so that’s why scientists are eager

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.610
to build a space sub for further exploration.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.400
The latest blueprints include a sonar array,
meteorology sensor, a retractable sail, and

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.570
a hydrodynamic skin for the 6 meter long sub.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.750
Plus cameras of course to take the best pictures
possible of what life is like underneath this

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.070
icy moon.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.359
The plan is for the sub to explore an area
called the Kraken Mare, which is Titan's largest

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:12.879
northern sea.

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.430
As it swims through the Kraken, it’ll determine
the lake’s chemistry, its depths, and map

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.430
the seafloor.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.129
But designing and constructing a submarine
that can survive at -300 degrees Fahrenheit

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.379
(-148 degrees Celsius) is a significant challenge
and one that quite frankly, might be completely

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.379
impossible.

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.999
And because Titan’s seas have concentrations
of ethane and methane, the liquid density

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.569
of the oceans and lakes could change, and
it could make it difficult for the sub to

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.650
propel through them.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.379
If NASA manages to overcome all these challenges
and is able to construct a fully autonomous

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.859
submarine, it’ll still take seven years
before it reaches Titan.

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:49.680
But we’re still holding onto hope that we’ll
see this crazy mission launch even if we have

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.260
to wait several decades for it happen.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.800
