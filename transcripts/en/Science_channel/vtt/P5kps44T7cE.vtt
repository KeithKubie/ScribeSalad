00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.667
♪♪

00:00:06.667 --> 00:00:09.000
Narrator: WORKERS UNLOCK THE TOP
OF THE STILL

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.467
AND POUR IN CHLORINE-FREE,
DEIONIZED WATER.

00:00:14.601 --> 00:00:16.667
ONCE THE STILL IS
ONE-QUARTER FULL,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:19.634
THEY ADD THE LEMONGRASS.

00:00:19.634 --> 00:00:22.267
THEY STACK THE BUNDLES
IN A CRISSCROSS FASHION,

00:00:22.267 --> 00:00:25.167
CREATING GAPS FOR STEAM
TO PASS THROUGH.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.033
THEY SCREW THE LID
TIGHTLY TO PREVENT

00:00:27.033 --> 00:00:30.067
THE LOSS OF STEAM
DURING DISTILLATION.

00:00:31.901 --> 00:00:33.367
THEY ACTIVATE THE STILL,

00:00:33.367 --> 00:00:37.334
AND IT HEATS THE WATER
TO THE BOILING POINT.

00:00:37.334 --> 00:00:40.868
STEAM RISES THROUGH THE PLANTS
AND PICKS UP THE OILS.

00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:43.133
IT CARRIES THE OIL VAPOR
UP THROUGH A PIPE

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:44.667
AND INTO A CONDENSER,

00:00:44.667 --> 00:00:48.000
WHERE THE VAPORS COOL
AND RETURN TO A LIQUID FORM.

00:00:50.067 --> 00:00:53.667
THE LIQUID OIL AND WATER
DRIP OUT INTO A FLASK.

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.200
OIL AND WATER DON'T MIX.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
SO THE OIL FLOATS TO THE TOP.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.734
AND THE WATER IS DRAINED OFF

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:03.000
AND RECYCLED BACK
INTO THE DISTILLER.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.701
THE TECHNICIAN THEN COLLECTS
THE LEMONGRASS OIL

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:09.501
IN A BOTTLE ONE DROP AT A TIME.

00:01:09.501 --> 00:01:11.200
THE LEMONGRASS OIL UNDERGOES

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.868
A SECOND DISTILLATION
IN A LABORATORY,

00:01:13.868 --> 00:01:16.534
USING A MORE SENSITIVE
PIECE OF EQUIPMENT

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.934
KNOWN AS
A ROTARY VACUUM EVAPORATOR.

00:01:19.934 --> 00:01:21.901
THE OIL FLOWS INTO A FLASK

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.467
THAT'S SPINNING IN A HOT BATH
OF VEGETABLE OIL.

00:01:26.434 --> 00:01:28.234
THE EVAPORATOR PUMPS OUT AIR

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:30.834
AND CREATES A VACUUM
IN THE FLASK,

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:32.901
WHICH LOWERS THE BOILING POINT.

00:01:32.901 --> 00:01:35.934
THIS PREVENTS DAMAGE
TO THE DELICATE MOLECULES

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:39.200
RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE LEMONGRASS SCENT.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.000
THE OIL VAPORS RISE
TO A CONDENSER COIL

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.767
WHERE THEY RELIQUEFY,

00:01:43.767 --> 00:01:48.300
LEAVING ANY RESIDUAL WATER
AND IMPURITIES BEHIND.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.400
THE PURE LEMONGRASS OIL DRIPS
INTO A RECEIVER FLASK.

00:01:54.234 --> 00:01:57.367
AS DISTILLED LEMONGRASS
OIL IS COLLECTED,

00:01:57.367 --> 00:02:01.300
MORE FLOWS INTO THE EVAPORATOR
BEAKER FOR PURIFICATION.

00:02:04.234 --> 00:02:08.367
THE DISTILLING PROCESS
IS CONTINUOUS.

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.801
THE ROTARY VACUUM
EVAPORATOR PROCESSES

00:02:10.801 --> 00:02:14.234
ROUGHLY 2 TO 3 QUARTS
OF FRAGRANT OIL PER HOUR.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.434
THEY STORE THE LEMONGRASS OIL
IN A COLD ROOM

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:22.701
WITH OTHER ESSENTIAL OILS.

00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:25.300
LIKE FINE WINE,
IT MUST BE KEPT COOL,

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.968
OR IT COULD SPOIL
AND RUIN ITS BOUQUET.
