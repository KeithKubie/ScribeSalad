00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:08.400
These things have been tucked away. And, you know, some of our scholars come to

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.679
use them and look at them to say, "Oh wow, this is a daguerreotype."  But the

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.189
biographies or the--you know, the autobiographical value--you know, people

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.600
sitting for these images, even if
it's being paid for by potentially

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.759
someone else. It's important, you know and
to know the context, you know, within

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.739
which these images were taken, and
therefore, kind of, the the memories that

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.540
would be associated with them
historically.  It gives the images more

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.219
depth and weight, right. And so I think,
you know, you have to spend time with

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.980
these materials to get to know the
materials. I mean, it sounds kind of weird

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.940
but that's research for you. You
know, you do a lot of work to get

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.850
the essence of--you know, it's the
questions that we ask. But it's also

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.939
developing a knowledge base where
you can be very articulate as it relates

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.590
to the time periods, but potentially
the people that you're looking at.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.960
I mean, the calico dress she's
wearing in this picture is not only

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.640
telling of of her class, but also what
she had access to. She may have been a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.900
seamstress, or someone else may have made
the dress. But the fact that she's

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.970
wearing this type of dress
in this kind of image, you know--and

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.430
it's an embroidered box as well, so
it was very personal. This may have been

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.240
a coin purse.
You know, it's like it was cut and then sewn on.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.480
An 1830s, 40s daguerreotype

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.900
such as this:

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
of an African American
man. Who...

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.720
I don't know what his occupation would've been.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.860
Daguerreotypes at this time
would have been expensive. So he could

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.320
have been a driver, owned by someone. Who
knows? He could have been a freedman like,

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.960
Frederick Douglas. But there's no
documentation.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.000
But when we put all these pieces together:
1829, 1840s, going back to
1818,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.700
there's a pattern here that develops.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.820
He potentially was a free man.
Where could he have lived? Maybe Ohio.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.140
Philadelphia. New York. Potentially.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.520
But he also could have
been enslaved, and this

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.200
was a way for his master, or owner, to
document his property.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.540
We don't know that.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.720
So all these different artifacts, these
different materials, tell a part of a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.880
larger story. And each of them had their--
you know, they have their own stories.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:59.220
But, you know, it's one of these,
you know, grand opportunities to try to

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:05.360
create sense, make sense, of history using
these materials, these artifacts.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.540
And we have that opportunity each and every day.
