00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.320
One of our deepest longings is for safety.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:09.140
We search for it through money, exercise, a good diet, a sound reputation,

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.140
insurance, seat belts, love.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.940
And yet we remain always horribly vulnerable.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.400
A tiny blood clot and we're gone.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.280
A small slip and our reputations destroyed.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.400
A moment of inattention on the road and we're dead.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.360
A few temptations and relationships shatter.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.080
We remain subject to a constant array of random accidents.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.560
Meteorites far above and malignant cells deep within

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.700
We don't have enough information to make
wise choices over a lifetime.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.760
We can hold back the chaos for a while but entropy, erosion and destruction will win out in the end.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.200
The calm of a sunny morning, the money you're saving

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480
the house you feel you own

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.020
the friendships you lay claim to

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.860
the relationship you think is beyond question

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.000
none of these promise lasting safety.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.640
We are all always desperately vulnerable.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.240
Our grasp on life, therefore, needs to be
loose, grateful, and ready for the worst.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.720
Our imaginations no strangers to the
full range of scenarios.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.020
We should also have a small, dark space in our minds
where we acknowledge just how perilous

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.680
everything we are and do really is.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.700
We should, in this space, be solemn and awestruck by the dangers we're up against.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.400
And, when we can manage it, before the small, everyday apocalypses

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.660
that do all of us in eventually

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.290
we should struggle to be kind and cheerful.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.880
