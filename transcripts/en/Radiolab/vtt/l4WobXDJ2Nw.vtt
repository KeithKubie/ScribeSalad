00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.920
I'm Molly Webster. This is gonads episode for this week.

2
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.450
We're releasing two episodes that are related starting with

3
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.530
hello [inaudible] bully. Now I said the TG gas. Yeah,

4
00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.210
I take it [inaudible] Radiolab say duty Chan is a world class runner from India.

5
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.790
Made us had Molly B TV. Hello, do you t? Hi, how are you?

6
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.590
Kinky. Have you had it? I called her with more perfect producers. Sar Cari,

7
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.220
I was having Sarra translate duty speaks Hindi. [inaudible].

8
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.950
We caught up with her and hydro bod where she's currently training and I called

9
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:49.820
her because a few years ago, right as her career was taking off,

10
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.210
she got caught up in this maelstrom that almost ended it and throughout the

11
00:00:57.021 --> 00:01:01.310
series we've been asking all these questions about biological sex inside the

12
00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:06.311
body and this moment in her life takes all of those questions and thrusts them

13
00:01:07.971 --> 00:01:11.480
out into the world in a very public way.

14
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.650
Casing. Just to start at the beginning, I've gotten better though. In p

15
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.700
made a joke. Go, hey duck.

16
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.370
<v 2>I'm from a village in Arissa called Chicago Board. How many?</v>

17
00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.980
There are nine people in my family. Six sisters.

18
00:01:31.981 --> 00:01:35.530
One brother and my parents, they [inaudible].

19
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.200
My oldest sister is the one who got me into running when I was five years old.

20
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.670
Duty sister was a track star in school. Okay.

21
00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:48.210
They made a wag board and [inaudible] and as I got older she started training

22
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:52.590
me, Brownlee club og Nikki. There was no track to run on,

23
00:01:52.591 --> 00:01:57.591
so I would run along the edge of the river or on the road or in the village,

24
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.340
what? Our family was poor and we couldn't afford shoes,

25
00:02:02.341 --> 00:02:06.420
so I would run barefoot and the tiny pebbles in the road would get stuck in my

26
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.370
feet. My sister pushed me.

27
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.220
She didn't let me slack off when I would complain or not want to train.

28
00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.551
<v 0>Years went on.</v>

29
00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:23.020
She kept training with her sister and she just got faster and faster and faster

30
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.690
until 2012 she had this big break.

31
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.930
<v 3>I'm trying to think of how old she was then.</v>

32
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.980
I think she was 16 this is a journalist who has spoken to and written about

33
00:02:33.981 --> 00:02:34.461
duty,

34
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.300
Ruth [inaudible] contributing writer at the New York Times magazine and Ruth

35
00:02:38.301 --> 00:02:38.721
says,

36
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:43.721
what happens in 2012 is do t qualifies for the National Youth Championships in

37
00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:49.160
Bangalore and she wins the a hundred meters in 11.8 seconds.

38
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.350
[inaudible] and usually Indian female runners are running that same race in 12.2

39
00:02:56.901 --> 00:03:01.901
or 12.3 seconds like grown up professional runners while she's still a teenager.

40
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.150
And then the next year she goes back to the youth national champion.

41
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.590
Chips wins gold in a hundred meters and the 200 meters that same year,

42
00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:15.340
still 2013 failure.

43
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.500
[inaudible] duty starts racing internationally.

44
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.210
Why did you jump into the World Youth Championship?

45
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.410
She ran her best hundred meter time yet this job that they do like number two

46
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.340
but that'd be live with one

47
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.960
11.62 only about a second slower than the world record.

48
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.450
And in June, 2014

49
00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.270
she wins gold again at the Asian championship in Taipei, medic, Boise

50
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.730
[inaudible]. My coach and my family started saying to me,

51
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:53.600
<v 0>duty, you're going to go to the Olympics.</v>

52
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.510
So duty is basically the hottest young female runner in India.

53
00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.140
And then 2014 was preparing for the Commonwealth Games.

54
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.770
Richard sort of like a warm up to the Olympics for certain countries.

55
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.090
And as she's preparing for the Games, um,

56
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.860
she gets sent to the team doctors for doping test and she said like,

57
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:23.170
this was kind of a normal part of her life, but

58
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.680
I had blood tests done ever since I was little.

59
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.180
We did take a dope test a month before every tournament and also after the race.

60
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.570
So she goes to see the team doctor and he's like, no blood,

61
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.380
we're going to do an ultrasound. Huh? Which is not normal.

62
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.910
And so she asked them why and they just said, oh,

63
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:51.750
we're like looking at your bone density. And so she's like, okay, whatever.

64
00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:55.740
Eventually she does do a normal blood test, uh, goes back,

65
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.680
keeps training for the Games. A couple of weeks later,

66
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.840
picks up the newspaper and sees her picture on the front page of the newspaper.

67
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.900
<v 2>[inaudible].</v>

68
00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:11.410
<v 3>There was a picture of me with a huge headline screaming dude,</v>

69
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.810
the disqualified from the

70
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.540
<v 2>team,</v>

71
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.540
Mitchell [inaudible] followed by the new story that said that [inaudible] I was

72
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:24.650
a male, not a female, she has no idea what's going on.

73
00:05:24.651 --> 00:05:28.730
But she said at that point, her phone starts blowing up when a number did best.

74
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:29.680
That was a bad call.

75
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.760
<v 3>The media called me and told me all the details like there was this gender test</v>

76
00:05:33.761 --> 00:05:36.930
that happened saying, is it true? Is it true you failed a gender

77
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.040
<v 2>test? No hybrids. [inaudible]</v>

78
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.200
<v 3>there was this hyperandrogenism test, this gender test,</v>

79
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.560
and the results said that I wasn't a woman, that I was a man. I

80
00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.120
<v 2>like [inaudible] and couldn't compete with the women, but men soon,</v>

81
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.170
good pride and ob, I was shocked.

82
00:05:52.171 --> 00:05:55.200
I didn't understand how this could happen again.

83
00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.700
And the media kept asking me, what are you actually, yeah, and I said,

84
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.750
I don't know.

85
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.260
My parents gave birth to me and I grew up the way that they raised me.

86
00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.450
The Miller King. I'm a girl,

87
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.590
I'm a woman and I didn't know about anything that was being reported about me.

88
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.903
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

89
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.470
<v 0>do you feel that gender test,</v>

90
00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.610
is that what was happening in the MRIs and the ultrasounds? Yeah.

91
00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:33.290
What exactly is a gender test like what is that exactly? I, yeah,

92
00:06:33.291 --> 00:06:37.670
I didn't I that he duty saying it was the first time I'd ever heard that phrase,

93
00:06:37.671 --> 00:06:42.590
but it's actually this thing that's been happening in sports for a long time and

94
00:06:42.591 --> 00:06:44.720
I'm going to take you on a journey back to the beginning of it.

95
00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:50.640
<v 5>[inaudible]</v>

96
00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.080
<v 0>so I didn't know this but the,</v>

97
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.850
but the sort of first modern day Olympics was 1896 which seemed very recent.

98
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.750
The reason, and there were no female athletes really and apparently like the,

99
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.380
the one of the people who is charged with sort of like restarting the Olympics

100
00:07:04.381 --> 00:07:08.430
said something like this is like no place for women. But sure enough,

101
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.540
by 1900

102
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.290
<v 5>I made great controversy.</v>

103
00:07:11.291 --> 00:07:14.300
It was decided to allow women to compete for the first time

104
00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.060
<v 0>you had 22 female athletes,</v>

105
00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:18.740
<v 5>which is,</v>

106
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:22.850
would express that athletic competition could physically damage the Lucas sex

107
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.060
<v 0>was not uncontroversial,</v>

108
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.830
but by the 19, by 1960, yeah.

109
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.570
<v 2>Wrote welcomes the summer games of the 17th Olympia,</v>

110
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.760
<v 0>which were the Olympics in Rome. There were 600 female athletes.</v>

111
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.550
And so two things complained at the same time,

112
00:07:40.551 --> 00:07:43.430
which is a lot of women now participating in the Olympics.

113
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.930
[inaudible] the Cold War, you know, the Soviet Union,

114
00:07:48.931 --> 00:07:52.240
the u s a lot of posturing. Yeah.

115
00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.250
And there was this like fear not very merited.

116
00:07:56.251 --> 00:08:01.251
It turns out that maybe the Soviets were taking men and putting them into female

117
00:08:03.811 --> 00:08:08.580
athletics to win more metals or that the US was doing that also. Huh.

118
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:12.690
And so what started were these things that everyone calls

119
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.240
<v 6>the nude parade?</v>

120
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.510
<v 4>Oh,</v>

121
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.343
<v 6>what is that?</v>

122
00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:22.530
So women would line up wearing bras and panties and they would go in front of

123
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.210
three doctors, often men. Um,

124
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.710
and they had to lower their underpants. And Are you serious?

125
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:37.030
Yes. And they were examined palpated and measured.

126
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.920
And this makes me very uncomfortable. Yeah, so invasive.

127
00:08:41.921 --> 00:08:45.130
So invasive. Invasive is the first word that comes to mind.

128
00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.470
So this is happening all throughout the city.

129
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.570
<v 0>People start to complain rightly</v>

130
00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:53.570
<v 6>and the IWF,</v>

131
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:58.810
which is the International Association of Athletics Federations and the

132
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.800
International Olympic Committee both come under criticism.

133
00:09:02.980 --> 00:09:03.813
<v 5>And so</v>

134
00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.250
<v 6>in the late 1960s they come up with another approach</v>

135
00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:09.640
<v 7>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.380
<v 6>another test. Okay. And that's a chromosome test. Okay.</v>

137
00:09:14.450 --> 00:09:18.430
I have to call the bar body test. Great. From the inside of the cheek,

138
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:23.670
a placed under a microscope and then tested for x's and y's dog spot showed up

139
00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:27.510
only on female cats. So anybody who has x,

140
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.520
x is okay cause that's supposedly equals female.

141
00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.870
And anybody who has something other than x, x is suspect.

142
00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.660
If they find a y chromosome in there, that means you your male.

143
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:40.210
Here you have a test that's theoretically less invasive.

144
00:09:40.211 --> 00:09:44.200
People don't have to pull down their underwear and way more precise.

145
00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:47.740
The idea at that point was, well,

146
00:09:47.741 --> 00:09:52.741
IOC in 1968 said that the chromosome test quote indicates quite definitively the

147
00:09:53.861 --> 00:09:54.940
sex of a person,

148
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:59.900
<v 5>except when it doesn't.</v>

149
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:04.580
<v 3>Like we talked about in our last episode,</v>

150
00:10:04.581 --> 00:10:08.450
there is a gene on the y chromosome that if you have it, and if it turns on,

151
00:10:08.451 --> 00:10:13.040
you will likely become a male. But there are a lot of x,

152
00:10:13.041 --> 00:10:17.690
y women in the world. These are women who had a y chromosome,

153
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:21.230
which is associated with male, but that little gene, it didn't turn on.

154
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.930
Conversely, you can have x, x males,

155
00:10:23.931 --> 00:10:27.890
meaning that little piece of the y chromosome got onto an x.

156
00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:32.150
There are all of these different chromosomes like aberrations.

157
00:10:32.151 --> 00:10:35.570
You could be x, x, x, x,

158
00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:40.130
you have two extra xs and you could have three extra xs as a woman,

159
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:45.050
as a female. Yeah Huh? You could be x, x, y, you can be x,

160
00:10:45.051 --> 00:10:48.530
y, y, and these are perfectly healthy people. It runs the gamut.

161
00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:53.300
You could have a fertility issues or developmental issues or no issues at all.

162
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:56.260
<v 6>And so the debate was, you know,</v>

163
00:10:56.261 --> 00:11:01.261
there were a lot of geneticists and endocrinologist who are saying sex isn't

164
00:11:01.991 --> 00:11:03.490
determined just by chromosomes.

165
00:11:03.491 --> 00:11:08.491
It's determined by hormones and by physiology and you know,

166
00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.070
totally getting away from gender, which is even more complicated.

167
00:11:12.071 --> 00:11:16.450
But just because you don't have x, x doesn't mean that you aren't

168
00:11:16.690 --> 00:11:17.523
<v 5>a woman.</v>

169
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:22.860
<v 3>And eventually all of the sports governing bodies came around to that</v>

170
00:11:22.861 --> 00:11:26.970
conclusion. And by 2000 everybody was like no more chromosome testing.

171
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.071
In fact,

172
00:11:28.071 --> 00:11:32.300
the World Federation that governs track and field has voted to scrap all testing

173
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:34.790
for gender. You have this moment where,

174
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:36.390
<v 7>mm,</v>

175
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:40.770
<v 3>it looks like gender testing is gonna go away. Cold War is over,</v>

176
00:11:40.771 --> 00:11:44.280
those fears are gone. Maybe we didn't need it anymore.

177
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:50.390
But then this other idea walked into the room that actually been there all along

178
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:53.070
this idea of fairness

179
00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:58.870
because the fact of the matter is if you compare male athletes to female

180
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.050
athletes and pretty much every track and field event, except for a few,

181
00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:04.480
here's a big difference in performance.

182
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.410
<v 5>[inaudible] marina paint drywall,</v>

183
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:09.040
<v 3>like take the 800 meters</v>

184
00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.400
<v 5>gone.</v>

185
00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:15.840
<v 3>The women's record is one minute 53 28 whereas the men, yeah,</v>

186
00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:20.150
<v 5>hello [inaudible]</v>

187
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:27.770
<v 3>almost 13 seconds faster. In fact, I talked to a,</v>

188
00:12:27.771 --> 00:12:31.900
I talked to on background to one female athlete world champion, uh,

189
00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:36.620
one of the fastest woman in the world and she said her fastest mile is regularly

190
00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:39.260
beaten by like a good high school boy.

191
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:45.670
And so if you're a female athlete or even like a spectator who's watching this

192
00:12:45.801 --> 00:12:50.060
sport, you want to make sure that females and males aren't racing each other.

193
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:53.960
And so what you saw, um,

194
00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:59.170
when this sort of like organized gender testing went away is that whenever

195
00:12:59.421 --> 00:13:03.410
someone got really, really fast, uh, whenever a female got really fast,

196
00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:06.350
there was finger pointing.

197
00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:08.010
<v 8>Okay.</v>

198
00:13:08.010 --> 00:13:09.870
<v 3>And this all came to a head in 2009.</v>

199
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:13.720
<v 5>So now we go down to trackside off all that excitement as the women try and</v>

200
00:13:13.721 --> 00:13:16.300
gather themselves for the 800 meters fine.

201
00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.900
<v 3>19th of that year, a South African runner, just 18 caster Semenya</v>

202
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.570
<v 5>[inaudible] Jessica crushes the field.</v>

203
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.140
[inaudible] is on again and she's great. Cyber showed up, cheese

204
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.700
<v 3>on the final lap she wins by is so much</v>

205
00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:39.640
<v 5>well that smashes the world list what, almost two seconds.</v>

206
00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:43.800
<v 3>And almost immediately after the race, my conclusion was, okay,</v>

207
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.820
something isn't a, something's going on here. There was something not right.

208
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.390
There was just a thought that there was a problem. Oh yeah. Yep.

209
00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:52.620
This is Madeline pape,

210
00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:56.730
my phd candidate in sociology and an Olympian for Australia.

211
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:59.640
She ran against caster Semenya and that heat is,

212
00:13:59.641 --> 00:14:02.700
she's since become a big defender of caster. But she says at the time,

213
00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:07.110
because the menus times were increasing so quickly because she was kicking the

214
00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:09.240
fields ass like so totally.

215
00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:13.200
People around me were talking about her spreading rumors and spreading.

216
00:14:13.410 --> 00:14:18.120
And what were the people around you saying? Oh um, is she a man? Look,

217
00:14:18.121 --> 00:14:22.440
she just looks like a man cause she's a tomboy. It wasn't that I was like,

218
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.650
I didn't hold a strong opinion about it. I just was like,

219
00:14:25.710 --> 00:14:29.040
I just want the IWF to, to deal with it and make it go away.

220
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.930
And so you had gotten to the point where you were opposed to caster competing.

221
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:34.141
Oh,

222
00:14:34.141 --> 00:14:39.141
I was opposed to Casta competing almost immediately at in Berlin

223
00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:41.863
<v 8>[inaudible]</v>

224
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.240
<v 3>over the next 24 hours.</v>

225
00:14:43.241 --> 00:14:47.320
She says the rumors got louder and louder basically like a cacophonous.

226
00:14:48.010 --> 00:14:50.590
<v 5>Well, there was a very dramatic race in Berlin last night,</v>

227
00:14:50.591 --> 00:14:52.070
but the drama had to do less with

228
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:55.490
<v 6>who won the race then who was in it and whether they should have been there.</v>

229
00:14:55.520 --> 00:14:57.410
There was discussion happening in the media.

230
00:14:57.470 --> 00:15:00.170
The big question this morning is whether one of the runners should be in the

231
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.680
men's or women's race. She runs like a man, talks like a man. Is she a man?

232
00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:10.160
Is the new world champion of the Women's 800 meter race? Really a woman at all.

233
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:14.200
When I'm pacing up, that's when the IWF the sport,

234
00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:15.440
<v 3>the governing body,</v>

235
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:20.090
the IWF claimed that they had no choice but to announce something at that point

236
00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:21.373
that yes,

237
00:15:21.890 --> 00:15:26.720
they were going to investigate Cassius ammonia because they had concerns about

238
00:15:26.721 --> 00:15:28.220
her sexual development.

239
00:15:28.330 --> 00:15:33.330
<v 9>If at the end of this investigation it is proven that the athlete is not a</v>

240
00:15:34.721 --> 00:15:35.554
female,

241
00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.940
we will reserve hall her name for the results of the competition today.

242
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:44.100
<v 3>It was one of those things I think where looking back I feel like,</v>

243
00:15:45.450 --> 00:15:48.180
um, it makes me sad. Yeah. It really makes me sad.

244
00:15:48.510 --> 00:15:50.100
What ended up happening to catch us the menu?

245
00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.700
<v 0>Well, the was banned her,</v>

246
00:15:52.701 --> 00:15:55.130
there were all these closed door meetings and she didn't raise for like a year.

247
00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:58.970
<v 3>What the IWF testing revealed about some menus.</v>

248
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.760
Physiological makeup never has been confirmed actually,

249
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:06.970
<v 0>but what emerged from all the Michigan is that in the end,</v>

250
00:16:07.431 --> 00:16:10.550
the eye devil AAF recommitted to gender testing,

251
00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.230
<v 6>trying to figure out some clear bright,</v>

252
00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:20.260
measurable way to draw a line between male and female.

253
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:24.410
We choose to have two classifications for our competitions,

254
00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.380
men's events and women's events.

255
00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:32.620
This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for those two

256
00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:33.674
categories

257
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000
<v 0>and the way they decided now to be clear was no longer about chromosomes,</v>

258
00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:42.730
no more medieval nude parades. Instead,

259
00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.240
they were going to look at hormones, specifically

260
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:48.050
<v 6>testosterone,</v>

261
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:53.050
testosterone either naturally occurring or artificially inserted into the body

262
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.070
provides significant performance advantages.

263
00:16:58.071 --> 00:17:00.440
I think there is little question about that.

264
00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:05.730
<v 0>The idea was we know that testosterone causes muscles that are like faster,</v>

265
00:17:05.981 --> 00:17:10.240
stronger, leaner, and that men have 10 to 30 times more testosterone than women,

266
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:12.220
which is a byproduct of having testes.

267
00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:17.260
And so the concern was in these women that have that, uh, y gene,

268
00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.510
um, either that they might have internal testes that haven't descended or like a

269
00:17:22.511 --> 00:17:23.830
gonadal streak,

270
00:17:23.831 --> 00:17:28.120
like some reproductive tissue that would be emitting testosterone,

271
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.550
giving them some sort of male like advantage.

272
00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:34.340
<v 6>And so in 2011, the um,</v>

273
00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.760
the IWF decides that they will institute a test for high testosterone levels.

274
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.130
And so if the testosterone levels falls

275
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.320
<v 3>with within the male range, um, then they're to be barred.</v>

276
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.160
And this is the first time they try and put a number on it.

277
00:17:50.161 --> 00:17:52.620
They say that your testosterone levels,

278
00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:56.460
if they're greater than 10 nanomoles per liter,

279
00:17:56.730 --> 00:18:00.060
you cannot run animals pretty. I know. What does that even mean?

280
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.080
So this rule gets put into place. Um,

281
00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.150
and this is the rule that do bumps into and ultimately pushes back against that

282
00:18:10.781 --> 00:18:12.900
part of the story. After the break,

so when do ti shows up in 2014 when they take her in for a secret gender test

299
00:19:21.030 --> 00:19:25.890
because she's doing so well. It is to test for high testosterone.

300
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:30.390
Lennix Federation of India, the cited, she did not count as a woman.

301
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.530
Her natural testosterone levels were too high and so

302
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.600
do t gets banned.

303
00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:45.750
I was just calling five, three days before the Commonwealth Games,

304
00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:49.600
one of the games and I was told that I couldn't participate because of

305
00:19:49.601 --> 00:19:50.740
hyperandrogenism.

306
00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:54.340
Had you ever even heard about like the idea that women could have high

307
00:19:54.341 --> 00:19:57.590
testosterone or something called Hyper Androgen Ism?

308
00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.530
[inaudible] hyperandrogenism give out. Admit.

309
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:05.250
So not talk about it man.

310
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.620
No, I didn't know anything about it. We'll blame what Judy's first thought was.

311
00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.870
Basically, this is bullshit.

312
00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:18.520
My family and my friends and my fans kept saying to me,

313
00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.160
you must be the victim of some kind of politics.

314
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:24.430
You were running so well and that's why someone's trying to stop you.

315
00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:30.340
So she gets her own doctor and she does the tests again.

316
00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.190
Well, she does the results in this test where the same

317
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.680
and I started to believe that there was something wrong with my body.

318
00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.063
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

319
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:46.380
<v 3>she told me that she cried for days.</v>

320
00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:48.310
The data [inaudible]

321
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.120
<v 2>it's not as mostly scared because I didn't know anything about it.</v>

322
00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:57.290
<v 6>She said, I felt naked. I am a human being, but I felt like I was an animal.</v>

323
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:59.780
I wondered how I would live with so much humiliation.

324
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.510
<v 2>[inaudible] in our village,</v>

325
00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:08.920
children are born at home and no one goes to the hospital to deliver babies.

326
00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:10.870
Had I been born at the hospital,

327
00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:14.460
maybe the doctor would have said what was going on inside my body and I would

328
00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:18.270
have probably understood this better as a child, like a named method,

329
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:21.250
but that wasn't the case.

330
00:21:21.251 --> 00:21:25.270
I was born at home and raised like a girl and there were no issues surrounding

331
00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:26.260
that though ligand

332
00:21:27.850 --> 00:21:30.550
[inaudible] and when suddenly the question was raised about my gender,

333
00:21:30.551 --> 00:21:34.150
calling me a male [inaudible] it was very confusing.

334
00:21:35.310 --> 00:21:39.310
Give me a [inaudible]. How could I have just become a man one day?

335
00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:49.630
<v 0>Ultimately duty decides I'm going to fight this and Ruth says she sends a letter</v>

336
00:21:50.331 --> 00:21:53.660
appealing her band to the Athletics Federation of India.

337
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.300
<v 6>She writes, I was born a woman, reared up as a woman.</v>

338
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.470
I identify as a woman and I believe I should be allowed to compete with other

339
00:22:01.471 --> 00:22:02.160
women,

340
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.270
many of whom are either taller than me or come from more privileged backgrounds,

341
00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.030
things that most certainly give them an edge over me.

342
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:14.400
<v 0>And eventually duty ends up at the, uh, court of Arbitration for [inaudible]</v>

343
00:22:17.370 --> 00:22:22.370
<v 4>[inaudible] is that a higher bodies and the I a a s it's like the,</v>

344
00:22:22.861 --> 00:22:26.760
it's like the Supreme Court of Sport. Wow. Everyone calls a cas.

345
00:22:27.510 --> 00:22:32.290
<v 0>So on the one side you have duty and on the other side you have the I a f I AA</v>

346
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.370
African [inaudible] track and field around the world.

347
00:22:35.610 --> 00:22:40.260
Sort of the way it breaks down is duties essentially making two main arguments.

348
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:45.120
The first is that the hyperandrogenism rule is discriminatory,

349
00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.980
discriminatory towards women, to which the IWF essentially says,

350
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.780
yeah, it kind of is,

351
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.200
but we're doing it for a reason and that reason outweighs the risk.

352
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.320
Right. Definitely. There's definitely an argument that if you eradicated gender,

353
00:23:02.110 --> 00:23:07.020
um, you would be screwing over hundreds of thousands of women. They're sort of,

354
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.210
their big thing is like, listen, as a society, even in this court case,

355
00:23:12.211 --> 00:23:14.700
we all seem to agree we want to separate men and women.

356
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.830
We need to figure out some way to do this. Do Tease response to that.

357
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.060
Her second argument is, sure, okay fine, we need you to separate the sexist,

358
00:23:24.061 --> 00:23:26.550
but the way you've chosen to do it is not solid.

359
00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:29.130
You have this number 10 nanomoles per liter,

360
00:23:29.131 --> 00:23:32.790
which is supposedly the high end of testosterone for women.

361
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:36.770
But if you actually look at the data, there's crazy variability.

362
00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:41.180
Like you will see women with levels that were like less than one and the levels

363
00:23:41.181 --> 00:23:46.070
that were above 30, um, which is typically thirties,

364
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.400
like considered high for men. So there was this, the,

365
00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.240
the studies that came out where one study was like, um,

366
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.040
we've, we've looked at all these different testosterone levels and you know,

367
00:23:58.041 --> 00:24:00.890
there's an average for men and there's an average for women and they're on

368
00:24:00.891 --> 00:24:04.610
different ends of a spectrum. But what we saw is there's totally overlap.

369
00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:08.020
It's not like one end, the other end, never. The two shall meet that.

370
00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:12.440
Like there's that, that some women go high and some men go low and you've got,

371
00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:13.190
you know,

372
00:24:13.190 --> 00:24:16.580
men with low testosterone who are world-class champions and you've got women

373
00:24:16.581 --> 00:24:19.460
with high testosterone that never win. It's just,

374
00:24:19.461 --> 00:24:24.020
it's not always clear the role that testosterone has in performance. Oh really?

375
00:24:24.021 --> 00:24:24.560
I thought it would.

376
00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.950
I thought that was well established that if the testosterone will make you

377
00:24:27.951 --> 00:24:29.930
faster and then what steroids do, well,

378
00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.990
th there's agreement that's synthetic testosterone,

379
00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.410
steroids ramps up performance helping both men,

380
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:40.310
male and female athletes jump higher and run faster.

381
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.600
But there's vehement disagreement about whether natural testosterone,

382
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:48.980
one's own testosterone has that same effect. Why, why wouldn't it?

383
00:24:49.670 --> 00:24:51.680
Well, that's a really good question. Um,

384
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:56.980
the IWF witnesses argue that logic suggests that natural testosterone is likely

385
00:24:58.761 --> 00:25:01.370
to work the way synthetic testosterone does.

386
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:06.670
But some scientists argue that a sudden burst of testosterone is much different

387
00:25:07.121 --> 00:25:12.121
than sort of a natural level of testosterone that your body's calibrated to the

388
00:25:12.561 --> 00:25:17.060
long and the short, the science is surprisingly contested. Furthermore,

389
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:20.720
duty argued, if you really want to talk about fairness,

390
00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:25.730
you need to look beyond sex. There are all sorts of advantages that people have.

391
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.061
You know,

392
00:25:26.061 --> 00:25:31.061
some people are born with increased aerobic capacity and others with resistance

393
00:25:31.371 --> 00:25:36.371
to fatigue or super long limbs or flexible joints are large hands and feet and

394
00:25:37.731 --> 00:25:39.950
other people have disadvantages. Like Dooty said,

395
00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:45.010
I came from a village and in southeast India where I raced for years with no

396
00:25:45.591 --> 00:25:49.370
shoes and only had vegetables and rice.

397
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.990
You know like if you want things to be fair then like we should all have the

398
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:58.280
exact same upbringing, the exact same coaching system,

399
00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:01.620
the exact same shoes. But the IWF say,

400
00:26:01.621 --> 00:26:04.320
well that's on about the division between men and women.

401
00:26:04.470 --> 00:26:06.360
If sports is divided by men and women,

402
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:10.110
we need to find out what the thing is that divides men and women.

403
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:14.730
July,

404
00:26:14.730 --> 00:26:19.440
2015 the court of Arbitration for sport rule today that duty Chandi could

405
00:26:19.441 --> 00:26:24.210
continue to race despite are higher than normal levels of testosterone court

406
00:26:24.211 --> 00:26:24.571
rules.

407
00:26:24.571 --> 00:26:29.571
That duty can continue to race and they say to the IWF like,

408
00:26:29.881 --> 00:26:34.260
you don't have enough scientific evidence to have this hyperandrogenism rule.

409
00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:36.270
Go work on that.

410
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.330
Let us know what you find and

411
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:45.720
[inaudible] through whole controversy. At least a year goes by.

412
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.400
Duty never stops running and he made it,

413
00:26:47.710 --> 00:26:52.020
cause my coach told me no matter what, just keep training,

414
00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.130
the bond was all day.

415
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:58.250
I wake up at 5:00 AM trained from six to 10 moto gloss in and then we hit the

416
00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:02.160
grounds again from four to six for the third round of training with the coach.

417
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:06.690
And the summer after the ruling at a big international meet in Kazakhstan

418
00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:12.910
<v 3>duty ran 11.3 in the hundred meter</v>

419
00:27:14.530 --> 00:27:15.011
setting,

420
00:27:15.011 --> 00:27:19.780
an Indian national record and she makes the Olympics India's duty.

421
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:24.340
Jon has scripted history becoming the first ever Indian woman to qualify for the

422
00:27:24.341 --> 00:27:28.180
three Olympics in the hundred meters event since 1980

423
00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:33.880
<v 0>meanwhile the IWF just like the court asked,</v>

424
00:27:33.910 --> 00:27:38.910
they go back to the drawing board and they commission their own study and last

425
00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:40.420
summer it was published

426
00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:42.650
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

427
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:47.270
<v 0>What they did was analyze blood samples from a couple thousand athletes at the</v>

428
00:27:47.271 --> 00:27:50.270
2011 and 2013 world championships.

429
00:27:50.271 --> 00:27:53.750
And what they were looking for was to see if the women with high testosterone

430
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.240
outperformed the women with low testosterone

431
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:58.110
<v 8>[inaudible].</v>

432
00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:03.110
<v 0>And what they found is that if you are a female runner who runs the 400 meter,</v>

433
00:28:03.751 --> 00:28:07.950
the 800 meter, the 400 hurdles are the mile,

434
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:14.000
you are conferred an advantage with high testosterone levels in only those

435
00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:17.640
events and only those events. Oh.

436
00:28:17.641 --> 00:28:22.290
And there's also a throwing event in one other. Um,

437
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:27.320
having high testosterone levels conferred an advantage of like 1.8% to four and

438
00:28:30.151 --> 00:28:34.100
a half percent faster, or like 2% to 4% roughly.

439
00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.530
And just to say like if you're a runner,

440
00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:41.540
1% could be like two tenths of a second,

441
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:46.640
one 10th of a second, which is, which is often how races are designed. Right?

442
00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:50.330
And these, so these, these distances are the higher distances.

443
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:53.720
Am I right to these distances of the middle distance idol distances? Yeah.

444
00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:54.613
So the sprint,

445
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:59.780
not the sprints and not the long with their study finds is that the sprints do

446
00:28:59.781 --> 00:29:03.170
not, you do not get an advantage from testosterone. The long distance.

447
00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:07.010
No advantage from testosterone. These middle distant races,

448
00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.100
seemingly an advantage from testosterone and a throwing event with a hammer

449
00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:15.470
throw what a fucking mess.

450
00:29:15.890 --> 00:29:20.090
So you're saying to me that like we started with like the nude parade and now

451
00:29:20.091 --> 00:29:25.091
where we end up with like the line that we've chosen to draw is in these middle

452
00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:27.230
distance races.

453
00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:31.130
That's where we're going to like make a big deal about trying to separate out

454
00:29:31.131 --> 00:29:33.840
the sexism. Yes. Like it feels just,

455
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:37.760
it feels like everyone's just arguing over change at this point.

456
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:40.670
Even since that study was published,

457
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.560
the data's been called into question and there's a call for retraction and they

458
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:47.290
publish it. There's a bunch of data errors.

459
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.090
The authors still stand behind the study and in fact the IWF is now using it as

460
00:29:52.091 --> 00:29:57.010
the basis for a new testosterone rule. They introduced this past April.

461
00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.900
We reached down to the IWF a few times, didn't hear back,

462
00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.410
but I mean, right now we're arguing about testosterone,

463
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.440
but I think that the bigger issue here is that we're like coming into a moment

464
00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:13.410
as society where we're more and more open to gender fluidity,

465
00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:18.960
but if we've all agreed on a whole that, that it,

466
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:23.430
that it's unfair to group women with men in sports,

467
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.250
then we do have to answer a real question,

468
00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.970
which is how do I keep the dichotomy,

469
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:31.770
the binary in athletics,

470
00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:36.840
while the rest of the world is changing and what you see with duty or any of

471
00:30:36.841 --> 00:30:41.190
these female athletes is they're sort of caught at the place where these two

472
00:30:41.191 --> 00:30:43.930
worlds meet. Those sort of things,

473
00:30:44.710 --> 00:30:49.610
which is a hard place to find yourself. TMZ

474
00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:55.980
Duty told me when this whole thing blew up, she was only 18 years old.

475
00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:01.830
I was at this age when boys and girls start falling for each other,

476
00:31:01.831 --> 00:31:05.880
and there was a guy who fell hard for me and I fell for him too.

477
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:12.360
We used to talk a lot on the phone and thought that one day when we got older

478
00:31:12.361 --> 00:31:13.200
we'd get married.

479
00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.800
But when the news in 2014 started appearing every layer,

480
00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.070
he started asking me who I was for real.

481
00:31:25.770 --> 00:31:27.060
He said, if you're a boy,

482
00:31:27.061 --> 00:31:30.990
then how can the two of us both boys stay together in the future?

483
00:31:30.991 --> 00:31:34.560
How will our dreams of having children or creating a family ever come true?

484
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.240
Eventually I did tell him that the results confirmed that I had hyperandrogenism

485
00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:47.040
and I asked him, are you going to love me and marry me or not?

486
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.990
He said, no,

487
00:31:54.010 --> 00:31:58.720
I don't love you anymore and I can't marry you because my family doesn't approve

488
00:31:58.721 --> 00:32:02.260
of our relationship I to kick it. So I said, fine.

489
00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:05.170
So he forgot me and I forgot him too.

490
00:32:09.510 --> 00:32:13.410
After that guy left me, there haven't been any other guys that like me anymore,

491
00:32:14.700 --> 00:32:19.080
but now a lot of girls have started liking me and a lot of them say that they

492
00:32:19.081 --> 00:32:22.530
want to settle down with me. How do you feel about that?

493
00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:24.900
Guess I'll look that up. Cool.

494
00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:34.260
I guess I feel happy and sad. My childhood dreams of having a husband,

495
00:32:34.261 --> 00:32:36.540
creating a family with him might not come true.

496
00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.010
But when I see all these girls still attracted to me, I often

497
00:32:40.010 --> 00:32:45.010
<v 2>wonder if I could make a home with a girl named [inaudible] in India.</v>

498
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.070
Only boys and girls get married. Girls don't marry girls.

499
00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:51.980
If it was more acceptable to marry a girl in India,

500
00:32:51.981 --> 00:32:53.210
do you think you'd want to do that?

501
00:32:56.300 --> 00:33:00.050
Right now I haven't thought about it and I'm focusing on my sports career,

502
00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.380
but after I'm done with my career,

503
00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.540
I am going to need someone to spend my life with. Right. They'll dictate.

504
00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:11.240
So I'll see if there is any guy that likes me,

505
00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:13.160
I would marry him and settle down.

506
00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:17.210
But if there aren't any guys interested in me and girls still like me,

507
00:33:17.211 --> 00:33:22.100
then I would settle down with a girl. Whoever likes me. Right.

508
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.650
It won't give me any like I would spend my life with them.

509
00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.833

Duty Chon made headlines by breaking her own national record in the 100 meter.

512
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.620
She beat it by 100th of a second.

513
00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:54.443
<v 4>Sure.</v>
