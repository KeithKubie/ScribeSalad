00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
MALE SPEAKER: Which brings our
event to its closing moments,

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.690
and gives me great pleasure
to invite the person who

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.200
brought it all
together onto stage.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.614
Mr. Rupert Whitehead.

00:00:07.614 --> 00:00:10.338
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:11.250
Thank you, Rupert.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.997
And some closing words.

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:14.830
RUPERT WHITEHEAD: Well,
thank you everybody.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.920
I mean, when we were first
putting this event together,

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.600
I was trying to think about
how we could squeeze the Google

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.640
world for developers--
or games developers--

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.060
into one single day.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.529
And we've had a
really crammed day,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.070
but I don't think we've actually
managed to cover everything.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.570
So we haven't
touched Chromecast,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.130
we haven't touched the web as
much as we could have done,

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.080
and there have just
been hints about some

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.910
of these other things
around the edges.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:42.770
It's a big world, but it's
a really exciting place.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.760
So in terms of what
I wanted people

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.860
to get out of
this, first of all,

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.360
it's understanding
a little bit more

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.980
about where Google
plays in this space.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.140
So what is it that we're
doing the makes us relevant

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.800
and will help you in your
world as games developers?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.170
So I hope we've got more
of an idea of that now.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.569
The second thing is, as
we've dived into the details

00:01:04.569 --> 00:01:07.760
of things like AdMob,
things like Google+,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.330
things like Games Play services,
you can see how that is going

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.720
to add concrete value
to your studios as well.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.320
And I hope also,
you've got the chance

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.670
to meet some really
interesting people

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.044
and chatted to
them in the break.

00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:23.150
So if you've ticked all
of those three things,

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.970
I think we've done
pretty well today.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.124
Now, it's actually kind of
an exciting time in Google,

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:31.540
because there's stuff that's
being announced all the time.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.320
And literally, at
this minute, there's

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.900
breaking news coming
from San Francisco.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.790
We've got a big Cloud
event that's running there.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.930
And Urs, who heads up
our infrastructure, that

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.420
runs all of our
Google services, is

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.640
making a big
announcement about Cloud.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.130
And he's making an
announcement on a number

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.280
of different points.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.742
So I haven't been able to
share slides with you on this,

00:01:56.742 --> 00:01:58.700
but I wanted to give you
some of the headlines,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.650
so you can go away,
think about that.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.200
And take that with you.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.530
And the first big
change is around price.

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.009
So in Google, we're a little
bit concerned in the sense

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.240
that you've got Moore's Law.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.860
And that's creating an
erosion of price on hardware,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.790
but you're not necessarily
getting those price

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.090
reductions-- in the
erosion of price

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.770
on hardware-- that gets
translated to you as a Cloud

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.000
customer.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.770
So the first big thing that
we're actually offering

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.410
is a 32% price drop in Compute
Engine, a 30% drop for App

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.040
Engine, a 68% drop
for Cloud Storage,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.740
which is pretty massive,
and a huge 85% percent cut

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.060
for Big Query-- which
we believe is about 75%

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.170
cheaper than any
other alternative.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.920
So we are expecting this to
have a significant impact

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.720
on the Cloud landscape as well.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.220
So all of you will have
with you some App Credits

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220
as well-- some Cloud
Credits-- that you

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.970
go in those little note pads.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.180
So use those.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.740
Explore the Cloud platform,
and get to know it better,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.630
because it's incredibly
cost competitive right now.

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.540
The second big announcement
that Urs will be talking about,

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.660
or is talking about,
is about simplicity.

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.240
To understand the pricing models
of Cloud worlds is complex.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.820
So figuring out things
like reserved instances,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.710
and exactly how much you're
going to pay is a tricky art.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.630
So what we're actually
implementing now

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.340
is something called automatic
discounts for steady state

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:40.230
workloads.

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.016
So that makes it a
lot simpler for you.

00:03:42.016 --> 00:03:44.540
We check your usage
over a monthly period,

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.422
and then apply the price drops
right at the end of the month,

00:03:47.422 --> 00:03:49.630
and so you actually make
some massive savings on that

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:50.420
as well.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.030
So in effect, you can save up
to about 53% for Compute Engine,

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.890
instance is if you've
got 24 by 7 usage.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.660
So again, big cost
savings there.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:04.540
He's announcing about new
operating system support.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.940
So we'll have Susie and Red Hat
support, Windows Server 2008

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.040
R2, and we're also
supporting Cloud DNS.

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.180
And so you can have DNS
as a service as well.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.360
And finally, we're
also building more

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.700
on what Mandy was talking
about earlier, blurring

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.590
this distinction
between infrastructure

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.130
as a service and
platform as a service.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.700
So making this much
more of a continuum.

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.210
So in the past,
you typically have

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:32.620
some sort of sense
of compromise.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.280
If you wanted the auto-scaling
functionality of App Engine,

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.647
but maybe a language
wasn't supported on it,

00:04:38.647 --> 00:04:40.480
you might have to go
towards Compute Engine,

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.600
but you wouldn't have
the auto-scale with it.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.000
But now with this hybrid model,
with managed VMs, which is now

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.430
in production, you can go beyond
that traditional compromise.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.800
You run whatever you want,
auto-scale it as well,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.850
on App Engine with
this managed VM model.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.850
And so summarizing all of that,
because that's quite a lot

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.892
to take on board there.

00:05:01.892 --> 00:05:04.100
I guess you can take away
that we're pretty committed

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.220
to Cloud, and that's
pretty important to us.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:09.820
Second, we're committed
to simplicity.

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:12.760
We want to make it easier to
understand the Cloud, easier

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.650
to be billed about
that, and easier

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.200
to be able to predict things.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.390
And third, we are
rethinking the way

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.300
Cloud computing can be done
with this hybrid model.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.100
So ultimately, all of
this should save you

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.280
time and money and effort.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.080
So lots to talk about there,
and lots to take in there.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.770
But the other thing
to mention, as well,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.360
is we're going to be
running a Cloud roadshow.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.970
So there are going to be
27 locations globally.

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:41.930
And there's one in
London, one in Manchester,

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.110
various events in the
Nordics, Italy, and so on.

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.930
So have a look at this
URL here, scan it later,

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.540
and explore that further.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.060
Because the Cloud
roadshow is going

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.382
to be where you can learn
a lot more about what we're

00:05:57.382 --> 00:05:59.590
doing in Cloud, and whether
that makes sense for you,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.040
and how it makes sense for you.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.150
So you can get a
next level of details

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.480
and get much more of an
unpacking of these Cloud

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.300
announcements than I've been
able to do justice to here.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:17.180
So in our closing words
really, a few impressions.

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.895
I mean, listening
to Dan's talk, there

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:22.380
was a lot to take
on board there.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:25.210
There was the social
graph, multiplayer

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.030
for iOS and Android,
increasing people's ratings,

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.224
the Unity support.

00:06:31.224 --> 00:06:32.640
But ultimately,
when I was looking

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:34.690
at a lot of those pieces
that come together,

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:36.070
it's about engagement.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.400
And so how do you create a
much more engaging experience

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:44.750
with your players to really
build loyalty, build your game

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.280
up, and build your following,
and ultimately revenue?

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.580
And Games Play
Services has clearly

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.690
got a pretty critical
role to do there.

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.850
On the analytics side,
again, engagement

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.290
is another running theme.

00:06:58.290 --> 00:06:59.860
How do you make
sure you understand

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.140
exactly what your
customers are doing?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.010
And actually, it
ties in quite neatly

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.440
to one of the things that
came up on the panel.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:13.280
Because actually, work starts
after you launch a game now.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.650
And that's really where
analytics fits in quite nicely,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.480
as well.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.530
Beginning to study
exactly where it

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:21.030
is that you can
retain your users,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:23.930
retain them, grow them, and
create the optimal gaming

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.590
experience.

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:26.970
And so hopefully you've
got some good sense

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.760
of where we go from there.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.460
And on the subject of
the panel, one thing

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.960
I kind of took away from
it-- even though it sounded

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.680
like kind of a pessimistic
title-- was this

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.620
is actually the best time
to be a game maker ever.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:44.790
And I think that kind of
comes through consistently

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:47.150
from pretty much all of
the talks that we've heard.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.180
We're in a really exciting time.

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:52.170
We're just getting
started, in a way.

00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:54.730
Lots of the pieces are
coming together now

00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.570
to really be quite
transformative

00:07:57.570 --> 00:08:01.860
and that's going
to be good to see.

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.350
With YouTube we
learned a lot more

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.470
about growing your
audience and engagement.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:09.840
And [INAUDIBLE] talk
on their experiences

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:14.419
of growing rapidly and scaling
very quickly, I think, show

00:08:14.419 --> 00:08:16.210
about that sort of
sense of the opportunity

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.550
that there is out there for us
as an industry-- and for games

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:22.500
developers, in
particular-- to go massive.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.560
And understanding that
going massive is great,

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.280
but being prepared for it and
having the right infrastructure

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.010
behind you is also a pretty
important piece as well.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.340
So that was an
excellent talk there.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.600
And [INAUDIBLE]
with AdMob talking

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.370
about all of these different
ways that you can monetize.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:45.010
Lots of new announcements like
the in-app purchase ad formats,

00:08:45.010 --> 00:08:47.510
having analytics
now more integrated

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:51.470
together, ad network management,
the app developer business kit.

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:53.430
All of this driving
towards an increased

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.870
revenue, which is valuable.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.530
And then we moved on to Addy's
talk, with Growing with Google.

00:09:00.530 --> 00:09:03.600
And for me, that was
about demonstration

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.570
we have a much more
joined up Google.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.400
This is not just
about social network,

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.980
it's about the identity
layer across Google,

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:14.170
and where identity
is important to you,

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:16.062
understanding your users.

00:09:16.062 --> 00:09:17.770
So it's about reach,
its about discovery,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.365
it's about acquisition,
it's about personalization,

00:09:20.365 --> 00:09:22.840
it's about retention,
and it's about the power

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.730
of recommendation to bring
new people to your game,

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:29.280
to make it stick here and
make it more effective.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.090
And then of course, with Noah's
talk, on the future of gaming,

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:35.880
I mean, that's incredibly
thought-provoking.

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.620
And I think we all feel that
it's such an exciting space,

00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.250
and there's so far that
we've still got to go.

00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:46.090
It's a nice place to be.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.750
So the last thing to say
is thank you all very much,

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:53.140
particularly our speakers,
and the events team, and Rich,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.670
for doing a great
job MCing, and mostly

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:57.900
to you for making this
such a fantastic day.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.500
Thank you.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.442
[APPLAUSE]
