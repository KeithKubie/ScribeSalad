yeah hello my name is Robert pusu and

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280
yeah hello my name is Robert pusu and
 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.430
yeah hello my name is Robert pusu and
I'm studying physics at the University

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440
I'm studying physics at the University
 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.670
I'm studying physics at the University
of rostock and my question to you what

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680
of rostock and my question to you what
 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.570
of rostock and my question to you what
was your motivation to to work in your

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580
was your motivation to to work in your
 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.870
was your motivation to to work in your
actually field so at the beginning I was

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880
actually field so at the beginning I was
 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.630
actually field so at the beginning I was
attracted by the subject of my PhD so

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640
attracted by the subject of my PhD so
 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.509
attracted by the subject of my PhD so
testing some suggestion by the Nobel

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519
testing some suggestion by the Nobel
 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.519
testing some suggestion by the Nobel
Prize navion malt he suggested that the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529
Prize navion malt he suggested that the
 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.370
Prize navion malt he suggested that the
spin of the electron can influence

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380
spin of the electron can influence
 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.110
spin of the electron can influence
strongly the conviction in ferromagnetic

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120
strongly the conviction in ferromagnetic
 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.299
strongly the conviction in ferromagnetic
metals so I could show in my PhD that

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
metals so I could show in my PhD that
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.240
metals so I could show in my PhD that
this was true that I can find some

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
this was true that I can find some
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400
this was true that I can find some
materials with a strong influence of the

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
materials with a strong influence of the
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.510
materials with a strong influence of the
spin in on the connection then after the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520
spin in on the connection then after the
 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.110
spin in on the connection then after the
pH team so I observe our ID on effects

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120
pH team so I observe our ID on effects
 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.090
pH team so I observe our ID on effects
you also to the effect of the spin on

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
you also to the effect of the spin on
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.770
you also to the effect of the spin on
the electrical conduction and my

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
the electrical conduction and my
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.790
the electrical conduction and my
motivation was also was all way to to

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800
motivation was also was all way to to
 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.399
motivation was also was all way to to
test my ideas and to explore a new

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409
test my ideas and to explore a new
 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.880
test my ideas and to explore a new
direction of a Saoirse always I try to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890
direction of a Saoirse always I try to
 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.890
direction of a Saoirse always I try to
avoid the action of Michelle what too

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900
avoid the action of Michelle what too
 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.800
avoid the action of Michelle what too
many people are walking and I prefer to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
many people are walking and I prefer to
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.940
many people are walking and I prefer to
two of my ideas my play with my

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
two of my ideas my play with my
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.630
two of my ideas my play with my
imagination and two so explore all the

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640
imagination and two so explore all the
 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.689
imagination and two so explore all the
new fields of research
