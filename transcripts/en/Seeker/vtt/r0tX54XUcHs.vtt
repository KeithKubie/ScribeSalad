00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:03.550
This is the face of an American environmentalist.

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.400
Richard Nixon, former republican President
of the United States.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.760
You see, not that long ago, environmentalism
was a fairly bipartisan issue.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.760
But all that changed.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.260
And it might be because of this guy... and
this guy.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.790
Many remember Nixon for Watergate, but a 2012
survey of top environmental groups named him

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.009
the 2nd greenest president in history, only
behind Teddy Roosevelt.

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.859
And that’s because it was Nixon who created
the EPA and NOAA.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.059
He passed things like the Clean Water Act,
the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.670
Species Act, the Pesticide Control Act and
extended the Clean Air Act.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.179
But some say this was all a political strategy
in order to compete with a potential 1972

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:46.809
presidential rival, Democratic Senator and
outspoken environmentalist Edmund Muskie.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.629
That’s right, in the early 1970’s the
republican strategy was to try to out-green

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:52.629
the democrats.

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.809
The tradition of the environmentalist president
continued up to George H.W. Bush, who not

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.929
only ran on environmental promises, he passed
an expanded Clean Air Act Amendment in 1990

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:04.750
and appointed the first conservationist to
lead the EPA.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.770
But as his presidency went on, Bush became
less environmental.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.030
Some think it’s due to the recession in
the early 1990’s, forcing him to put the

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.210
economy over the environment.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.820
And then there were these guys.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.780
Challenging Bush for the White House was a
democratic ticket featuring Al Gore, who had

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.560
just written a book that would eventually
be turned into the documentary “An Inconvenient

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.590
Truth.”

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.510
Gore’s environmentalism was seen as a threat
by the right, with Bush going as far as saying

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.370
he was “so far out in the environmental
extreme we’ll be up to our necks in owls

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.680
and outta work for every American.”

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.140
Clinton and Gore argued that environmentalism
isn’t just good for Earth, but would be

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.240
good for jobs and touted a “market-based
environmental strategy.”

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.450
Protecting the environment was now a split
political issue.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.730
Now, you can’t blame this change entirely
on the 1992 election, there were other factors

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.700
before and since that have added to the divide.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.640
But since the early 90’s, the general voting
population and members of congress have grown

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.000
farther and farther apart on the environment.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.171
The Democrats fight to enact laws to protect
the environment that they feel will help the

00:02:04.171 --> 00:02:08.500
economy in the long run and the Republicans
fight against environmental regulations they

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.570
feel are making it harder for companies to
prosper, hurting the present day American

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.940
workforce.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.210
Environmentalism was once a bipartisan presidential
stance because it was a bipartisan voter stance.

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.891
69% of the voting population was concerned
about air pollution when Nixon signed the

00:02:22.891 --> 00:02:24.140
Clean Air Act.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.300
It was a smart political move.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.780
So, until the voting public can agree on how
to move forward with things like global warming,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.060
fossil fuels, and federal land rights, America
probably won’t see the political parties

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.620
agree on the environment any time soon.
