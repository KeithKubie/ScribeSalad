00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.710
This is yarrow, a flowering plant

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:03.580
found all over
the Northern Hemisphere.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.549
Its feathery leaves have
natural astringent properties,

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.070
and its scientific name, Achillea,
comes from Achilles, the Greek

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.110
hero, who is said to have used
it on the wounds of his soldiers.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.580
And this is snakegrass, also known
as horsetail or, to the kids,

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.020
popgrass, because you can
just pop it apart, and then put it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.960
back together again. Although
on top there, it's dead now.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.110
And this is a ponderosa pine,
one of my favorite trees.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.710
They can grow hundreds of feet tall,

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.070
and on a warm day if you sniff
it, it smells like butterscotch.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.570
They all have different
shapes, sizes, and properties,

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.440
but each of these things is a
vascular plant, one of the most

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.499
diverse and, dare I say, important
families in the tree of life.

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:39.510
Since their predecessors first
arrived on the scene some

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.109
420 million years ago, vascular
plants have found tremendous

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:46.559
success through their ability to
exploit resources all around them.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.699
They convert sunshine into food.
They absorb nutrients directly

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.589
through the soil without the
costly process of digestion.

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:55.550
And they even enlist the help
of some friends when it comes

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.229
to reproduction, so often when
they're doing their thing it

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.729
involves a third party.
Which, y'know, good for them.

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:01.969
But these things alone can't

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.840
explain vascular plants'
extraordinary evolutionary success.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.790
I mean, algae was photosynthesizing

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.680
long before plants
made it fashionable.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.640
And as we learned last week,
nonvascular plants have reproductive

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.900
strategies that are tricked
out six ways from Sunday.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.870
So, like, what gives?

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.120
The secret to vascular plants'
success is in their defining trait:

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.100
conductive tissues that
can take food and water

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.580
from one part of a plant
to another part of a plant.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.290
This may sound simple enough,
but the ability to move stuff

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.530
from one part of an
organism to another was a

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.290
huge evolutionary breakthrough
for vascular plants.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.750
It allowed them to
grow exponentially larger,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.820
store food for lean times,
and develop some fancy features

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.290
that allowed them to
spread farther and faster.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.440
It was one of the biggest revolutions
in the history of life on Earth.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.190
The result? Plants
dominated Earth long before

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.710
animals even showed up.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.940
And even today, they hold
most of the world records:

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.160
The largest organism in
the world is a redwood

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.570
in Northern California,
115 meters tall.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.310
Bigger than 3 blue whales
laid end to end.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.880
The most massive organism is a
grove of quaking aspen in Utah,

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.810
all connected by the roots, weighing
a total of 13 million pounds.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.619
And the oldest living thing?

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.700
A patch of seagrass
in the Mediterranean

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.190
dating back 200,000 years.

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.920
We've spent a lot of
time congratulating ourselves

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.540
on how awesomely magnificent and
complex the human animal is,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:25.010
but you guys, I gotta
hand it to you.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.380
So you know by now, the more
specialized tissues an organism has,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.400
the more complex they are
and the better they typically do.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.590
But you also know that these
changes don't take place overnight.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.959
The tissues that define vascular
plants didn't evolve all at once,

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.180
but today we recognize three types

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.130
that make these
plants what they are.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.209
Dermal tissues make up their

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.790
outermost layers and help
prevent damage and water loss.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:53.900
Vascular tissues do all of that

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.880
conducting of materials
I just mentioned.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.550
And the most abundant
tissue type, ground tissues,

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.790
carry out some of the most
important functions of plant life,

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.470
including photosynthesis
and the storage of leftover food.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.340
Now, some plants never
go beyond these basics.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.319
They sprout from a germinated seed,

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.230
develop these tissues,
and then stop.

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.680
This is called primary growth,
and plants that are limited

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.130
to this stage are herbaceous.

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.130
As the name says,
they are "like herbs"

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.670
small, soft and flexible, and
typically they die down to the root,

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.250
or die completely,
after one growing season.

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.630
Pretty much everything you see
growing in a backyard garden:

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.780
herbs, flowers, broccoli
and that kind of stuff,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.569
those are herbaceous.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.680
But a lot of vascular plants
go on to secondary growth,

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.380
which allows them to grow
not just taller but wider.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.170
This is made possible by the
development of additional tissues,

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.989
particularly woody tissues.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.319
These are your woody
plants, which include shrubs,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.569
bark-covered vines called lianas,
and of course, your trees.

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.300
But no matter how big they
may or may not grow,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.970
all vascular plants are organized
into three main organs,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.720
all of which you are intimately
familiar with, not just because

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.180
you knew what they were when
you were in second grade,

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.739
but also because you probably
eat them every day.

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.910
First, the root. It absorbs
water and nutrients,

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.160
and serves as a pantry of
leftover food, and of course,

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.739
keeps the plant anchored
in the ground.

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.170
Next, the stem. It contains
structures that transport fluids,

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.050
stores nutrients, and also is
home to specialized cells

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.449
called meristems that are
responsible for creating new growth.

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.049
But their most important task
is to support the last organ:

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.620
The leaf. This, of course,
is where the plant exchanges gases

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.460
with the atmosphere and collects
sunlight to manufacture food,

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.160
with the help of water and
minerals collected through the root

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.330
and sent up through the stem.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.100
Now, each of these organs
contains all three tissues,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.380
which together work to
absorb, conduct, and exploit

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.880
one of the world's most
important molecules: water.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.520
So, since plants are pretty
much designed around water,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.639
let's follow some H2O to see
how plants make the most of it.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.720
First, as with most organisms,
nothing can get in or out of a plant

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.210
without getting past the skin,
in this case the dermal tissue.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.840
In smaller, non-woody plants,
most of this is just a thin layer

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.080
of cells called,
fittingly, the epidermis.

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.130
Naturally, this is great for
keeping the outside out

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:04.510
and the inside in, but the
epidermis can also sport

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.729
some snazzy features in
different parts of the plant.

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:09.740
In leaves and stems, for example,
it often has a waxy outer layer

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.990
called a cuticle that
helps prevent water loss.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.110
On some leaves, or on pods
that hold those valuable seeds,

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.400
the epidermis can sprout hairlike
structures called trichomes

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.960
that help keep insects at bay and
secrete toxic or sticky fluids.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.910
The same secretions that make
the yarrow useful for first aid,

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.770
for instance, are
also what discourage

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.350
ants from using it for lunch.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.930
Finally, in the roots, the epidermis
has similar features called

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.010
root hairs that maximize the root's
surface area for absorption,

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.229
just like we've seen in
our own organ systems.

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.500
This, of course, is where the plants
generally absorb the water they need.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.660
By the way, the cells that
make up this dermal tissue

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.130
are the most basic, essential
building blocks of vascular plants,

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.340
called parenchyma, or
"visceral flesh," cells.

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.780
These are the most abundant plant
cells, found not just in roots

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:53.750
but also in stems,
leaves, and flowers.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.850
They're thin and flexible
and can perform all kinds

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.990
of functions depending
on their location.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.360
Now, after passing through the
skin of the root and through

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.190
its starchy cortex, or outer layer,
water arrives in the first of

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:08.150
two kinds of vascular
tissue: the xylem.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.800
The xylem's main function is
to carry water and dissolved

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.410
minerals from the root
up to the leaves.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:16.100
But, like, how?
How, by Zeus' beard,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.130
can plants make water defy gravity?

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.009
Well, a lot of the reason is that,
up top, the plant is continuously

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.199
evaporating water through a
process called evapotranspiration.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:27.660
As water evaporates from the
leaves, which I'll explain

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.860
in greater detail when we get
up there, it creates negative

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.199
pressure inside the xylem,
which draws more water upward.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.080
Plants can transpire truly
staggering amounts of water,

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.770
and it's because of this that
our atmosphere is habitable.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.500
A single acre of corn gives
off about 3,000 gallons

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.160
of water every day.
A large oak tree, just one tree,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.820
can transpire 40,000
gallons in a year.

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.740
Only 1% of the water that plants
absorb is actually used by plants,

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:56.910
mostly in photosynthesis.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.960
The rest is slowly, and invisibly
released, providing one

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.400
of Earth's most crucial functions,
transporting water from

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.100
the soil into the atmosphere,
where it then returns to the

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:11.120
surface as rain, making
all life possible. Yeah.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.320
Chew on that as we
continue up the xylem.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:16.620
And as we get higher in the
plant, we begin to encounter

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.229
a greater diversity of cells,
designed not only for moving stuff

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:22.620
around but also for
providing structural support.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:25.190
For instance, elongated cells
with thicker cell walls,

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:28.380
called collenchyma, help hold
up the plant body, especially

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.600
in herbaceous plants and young
structures like new shoots.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.229
Celery is mostly made
up of these cells,

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:36.039
so you already know
what they taste like.

00:07:36.039 --> 00:07:39.759
In larger, woody plants,
you also find sclerenchyma cells,

00:07:39.759 --> 00:07:41.370
especially in the xylem.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:44.470
These have even thicker cell
walls made from lignin,

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.720
a super-strong polymer
that makes wood woody.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:48.710
What's weird about
sclerenchyma cells, though,

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:52.220
is that most of them when they
reach maturity, they die.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.319
They just leave behind their
hearty cell walls as a support

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:57.949
structure, and new cells form
a fresh layer during the next

00:07:57.949 --> 00:08:00.759
growing season, pushing the
old, dead layer outward.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:03.979
In warm, wet years these layers
grow thick, while in cold,

00:08:03.979 --> 00:08:06.169
dry years they're light and thin.

00:08:06.169 --> 00:08:08.860
These woody remains form tree
rings, which scientists can use not

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.250
only to track the age
of a tree but also the

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:13.600
history of the climate
that it lived in.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.940
Now, at the top of the
xylem, water arrives at

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.259
its final destination: the leaf.

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:20.889
Here, water travels through an
increasingly minuscule network

00:08:20.889 --> 00:08:23.550
of vein-like structures
until it's dumped into a new

00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:25.300
kind of tissue
called the mesophyll.

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.280
As you can tell from its
name, meso meaning "middle"

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:30.780
and phyll meaning "leaf,"
this layer sits between the

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.080
top and bottom epidermis
of the leaf, forming the bacon

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.140
in the BLT that
is the leaf structure.

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:39.419
This, my friends, marks our
entry into the ground tissue.

00:08:39.419 --> 00:08:41.240
I'm sure you're as excited
about that as I am.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.479
Despite its name, ground tissue
isn't just in the ground,

00:08:43.479 --> 00:08:46.370
and it's actually just defined
as any tissue that's either

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:47.880
not dermal or vascular.

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:51.480
Regardless of this low billing,
though, this is where the money is.

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.000
And by money I mean food.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.300
The mesophyll is chock full o'
parenchyma cells of various shapes

00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.350
and sizes, and many of them are
arranged loosely to let CO2 and

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.940
other materials flow between them.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.000
These cells contain the
photosynthetic organelles,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.910
chloroplasts, which as you know
host the process of photosynthesis.

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:11.740
But, where is this CO2 coming from?

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.080
Well, some of the neatest
features on the leaf are

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.540
these tiny openings in
the epidermis called stomata.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:21.339
Around each stoma are two
guard cells connected at both ends

00:09:21.339 --> 00:09:23.260
that regulate its size and shape.

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.800
When conditions are dry
and the guard cells are limp,

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.130
they stick together,
closing the stoma.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:30.850
But when the leaf is flush with
water, the guard cells plump up

00:09:30.850 --> 00:09:34.230
and bow out from each other,
opening the stoma to allow water

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:37.070
to evaporate and let
carbon dioxide in.

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:39.830
This is what allows
evapotranspiration to take place,

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.100
as well as photosynthesis.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:44.290
And you remember photosynthesis:
Through a series of brain-wrackingly

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:47.029
complicated reactions sparked
by the energy from the sun,

00:09:47.029 --> 00:09:50.440
the CO2 combines with hydrogen
from the water to create glucose.

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.550
The leftover oxygen is
released through the stomata,

00:09:53.550 --> 00:09:55.160
and the glucose is
ready for shipping.

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.260
Now, if you've been paying
attention, you noticed that earlier

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.620
I said that there are two
kinds of vascular tissue,

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.370
and here the circle is
made complete as the sugar

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:04.110
exits the leaf through the phloem.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:06.589
The phloem is mostly made
of cells stacked in tubes

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:08.690
with perforated plates
at either end.

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:10.300
After the glucose is
loaded into these cells,

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:12.540
called sieve cells or
sieve-tube elements,

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.019
they then absorb water from
the nearby xylem to form a rich,

00:10:16.019 --> 00:10:18.120
sugary sap to transport the sugar.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.260
This sweet sap, by the
way, is what gives the

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.029
ponderosa its delicious smell.

00:10:22.029 --> 00:10:24.050
By way of internal
pressure and diffusion,

00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.660
the sap travels wherever it's
needed, to parts of the plant

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.779
experiencing growth during the
growing season, or down to the root

00:10:29.779 --> 00:10:33.220
if it's dormant, like during winter,
where it's stored until spring.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:35.490
So now that you understand
everything that it takes for vascular

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.180
plants to succeed, I hope you
see why plants = winning.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.750
And I'm not just talking about
them sweeping the contests for

00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:45.390
biggest, heaviest,
oldest living things.

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.050
Though, again,
congrats on that, guys.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:49.790
Plants are not only responsible
for, like, making rain happen,

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.990
they're also the first and most
important link in our food chain.

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.769
That's why the world's
most plant-rich habitats,

00:10:55.769 --> 00:10:59.230
like rain forests and grasslands,
are so crucial to our survival.

00:10:59.230 --> 00:11:01.750
When those habitats
change, everything changes:

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:05.080
weather, food supply, even the
incidence of natural disasters.

00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.649
So I, for one, welcome our plant
overlords, because they've done

00:11:08.649 --> 00:11:11.360
a great job so far,
making life on Earth possible.

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.580
But, I know you're curious,
how do different kinds of plants

00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.700
make more plants? That's all
about the birds and the bees,

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.730
which is what we'll be
talking about next week.

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:22.670
