[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.170
ALLEN HARVEY: Everyone, welcome.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.830
Welcome to Create App-like
Experiences on Google Search

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.060
and the Assistant.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:12.290
I'm Allen Harvey.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm a product manager
on Google Search,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.090
and I'm really excited
you all are here.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.030
We're going to talk about
a new set of capabilities

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.100
that we're enabling
for you all to use

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.530
to create app-like
experiences on Google

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.000
Search and the Assistant.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.370
These are new capabilities
not released before,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.290
and we're really
excited that you're here

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.460
to learn about them.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030
So what am I going
to cover today?

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.170
Four things.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.380
So I'm going to introduce
a new way to engage users

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.240
on Search and the Assistant.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.480
I'm going to highlight these
unique, new capabilities

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.240
and talk about why they
can work for you all.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.510
I'm going to show you how
to create one live onstage

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.730
and see it appear on Search.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.235
And then I'm going explain
how you can get involved.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.040
So as you all know,
Google's mission

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.040
and Google Search's mission
is to organize the world's

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.230
information and
make it universally

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.540
accessible and useful.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.310
As a product manager
on Search, this

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.190
is what I work on every
day, figuring out new ways

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.560
that we can make Search
more useful to help

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.760
people find information
more quickly and easily.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.010
And Search has started
out with blue links.

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.540
You're all familiar with them.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.210
And they look something
like this on the left.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.420
And over time, we've
added rich new formats

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.590
such as structured data and
content, carousels, larger

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.290
images, all working
to make Search

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:41.630
more useful for everybody
who comes and uses it.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.110
And we've also added ways to
make Search more interactive.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.770
So for example, if you
search for how many calories

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.740
are in an apple, you get a
simple interactive experience

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.850
like this.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.785
It tells you the
answer right on Search

00:01:54.785 --> 00:01:57.650
where you can choose,
say, the variety of all

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.580
of apples in the dropdown or the
amount in the second dropdown.

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.480
Now this is a simple
interactive component,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.720
but it makes Search much
more valuable for people

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.820
who come looking for help.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.310
Of course, if you keep looking,
say, how many meters are

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.210
in a yard, you'll
get an experience

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.310
that shows you the
conversion right

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.540
on Search, same simple drop
downs there, but a few more

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.300
of them, and also
different types of inputs

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.530
we're starting to introduce.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.040
Here you can type answers,
type numbers and information

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.400
right into Search and see
the answer change right

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.400
on the search results page.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.950
And of course, there's
the translation capability

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.310
we all know and love.

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.930
If you search for, say, how
do I say love in French,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.870
you get the translation
right on Search.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.790
And you can tap
in and change it.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.180
You can see the translation
update in real time.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.360
You can change which language
you translate between,

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.040
and you can expand
the experience

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.570
to see more details
about that translation.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.780
All of this is starting to
introduce more interactivity

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.740
to the search results page.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.350
And if you think about other
rich experiences we have,

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.940
such as weather or sports where
you see rich experiences that

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.250
are interactive,
helping users find

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.920
what they're looking for more
quickly and easily on Search.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.280
And while we love
these experiences,

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190
we know there's more to do.

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.040
You all have created some of
the most engaging and rich

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.110
experiences on the
internet whether you're

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.350
a web developer, an assistant
developer, or a native app

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.350
developer.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.050
We said, how can we
expand upon this?

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.350
How can we help web
developers bring

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.650
rich, interactive, app-like
experiences to Search?

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.950
For example, you have
interactive actionable

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.350
workflows on your sites that
help users get things done,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.710
to help you put the best
foot forward when somebody

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:54.640
comes to your site or service.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.360
How could we help you
bring the beginning of that

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.090
to Search so you can engage
users right in the search

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.720
results page so they can start
that journey right on Search

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.480
or the Assistant?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.310
Or if you're an
assistant developer,

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.810
and say you want
to create an action

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.540
that has a visual
aspect to it, how

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.090
can you build one that
works both on Search

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.930
and the Assistant?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.170
How can we enable you to bring
those visual actions that

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:23.820
would work for both
services and build them?

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.900
And finally, if you're a native
app developer, many of you

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.160
may have static download pages
to engage users and tell them

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:34.160
why they should download
your application.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.650
But how can we help you move
beyond a static download

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.830
page on the web and engage
users with a focused

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.440
subset of that functionality
right on search

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.650
or the Assistant so you start
to get a feel for your service

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.880
or product right away?

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.620
In short, we asked
ourselves, how can we

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.260
go from interactive
experiences created

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.120
by Google to rich, interactive,
app-like experiences

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.040
created by you all?

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.730
So today, I'm excited
to announce that we're

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.650
introducing Mini-apps.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.230
So Mini-apps are a new
capability on Search

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.960
and the Assistant
that enable you all

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.900
to engage users with
interactive flows

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.650
and live content
right on each surface.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.380
These capabilities
are new, and we're

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.310
going to give you an
early preview of this

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:28.840
and talk about how it'll work
and how you can get involved.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.650
And we're excited to be
introducing this today.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.400
All right, so why
build a Mini-app?

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:40.980
So Mini-apps appear right
on the search results page

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:42.570
among the blue links.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.230
For example, standard, a set
of blue links on the left.

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:49.980
And if you're an online
course-providing company here,

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.140
you could create a Mini-app
that will appear right

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.660
among the blue links and
show a rich, interactive set

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:55.920
of results.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.780
In this case, an
online course provider

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.450
might want to show its most
popular classes when somebody

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:03.000
searches for them to
make sure users see

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.370
all the rich content that
they offer right away

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.910
right on search.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.520
They might want to
add interactivity

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.380
so a user can
discover what classes

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.520
are available by tapping in
to see which start this week

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.720
or those that are
made for beginners.

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.810
Mini-apps enable you to
bring your live content

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:22.890
and interactivity
right to Search.

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:25.870
But that's just the
first page of a Mini-app.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.425
Mini-apps can do more.

00:06:27.425 --> 00:06:28.800
They're designed
to make sure you

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.140
can build an experience
for users that

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.780
help you put your best
foot forward and engage

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.460
with the products
and services you

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.140
offer in unique ways on Search.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.410
In this case, this
online course provider

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.360
has wanted to tell users about
the latest offerings they have

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.610
and let them discover more.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.820
For example, in the
first page, they

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.100
would see those most
popular classes.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.920
But a user could tap on
one, say, Google Cloud

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.580
certification, and see
more about the course.

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:02.160
But the user's journey
doesn't stop there.

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.440
Mini-apps enable you
to hand off the user

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.020
to the best place on your site
or service to engage them.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:10.890
For example, if a user
decides they like this class,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:13.350
they can tap More Info
to go to your site,

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.150
or if they wanted
to enroll right now,

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.220
they could tap
Enroll in This Course

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:18.900
and go to the right
place on your site

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.020
to begin enrolling immediately.

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:24.310
Of course, they can also
click View More Courses,

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:26.820
go back and see
the full carousel

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.370
of offerings that were appearing
right on the search results

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:30.640
page.

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.120
This new capability is
designed to enable you all

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:36.840
to engage users with the key
aspects of your offering right

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.930
on the surface.

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:42.990
But many of you may not
have real-time offerings

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:44.370
like this you want to show.

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.850
What if you need to help users
look up more information?

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:49.460
Mini-apps can also do that.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.210
Say I'm a shipping
company and I want

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:55.020
to help users find the status
of a package right away.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.620
This demo Mini-app--
this example Mini-app

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:00.630
we've created here,
on the left, you

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:03.470
see when I look for
to track a package

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:05.190
number with this
shipping company,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.340
the Mini-app appears right
in the search results page

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:10.980
and prompts the user for input.

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:13.650
The user taps in, and you
get this expansive experience

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:15.720
that you see there
in the middle.

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:19.050
The user puts in their
package-tracking information,

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:23.250
clicks track, and sees the
real-time status of the package

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.860
appear right on search.

00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:28.170
Now that real-time
information comes

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:31.680
because Mini-apps make a call
to your APIs and infrastructure

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.200
to get the real-time content.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.100
So when you create a Mini-app,
the Mini-app calls in real time

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:41.250
your infrastructure to make
sure it's serving the content

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.970
that you know is the latest
that you want users to see.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:49.530
But even in this case, the user
journey doesn't stop there.

00:08:49.530 --> 00:08:52.540
It's decided by the company
that creates the Mini-app.

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.420
If you wanted to
enable users to call

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.400
you to get more
information, say there

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.890
is an exception in the
package-tracking journey

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.800
and the user needs to call
to understand what happened,

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.290
say, there's more functionality
and capability you

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.790
offer on your site.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.210
The user could tap through
to, say, redirect a package

00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:12.330
or view more information
about the package.

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:14.660
And finally, if they wanted
to track another one,

00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.340
a user could click
Track Another Package,

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.130
go back to the middle
screen, and engage

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:22.770
right with your rich
experience right

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:27.680
on Search and the Assistant.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.950
So Mini-apps, to help you
bring these rich capabilities

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.450
to Search and the
Assistant, we said

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:34.830
they had to do a
couple of things.

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:37.110
You saw them throughout
the examples.

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.860
First, they had to help you
all bring interactive workflows

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.010
to Search.

00:09:41.010 --> 00:09:44.210
You all have built wonderful
services and capabilities.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.360
And how can we help you help
users begin the journey right

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.180
on Search, starting with
interactive workflows that

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:51.630
take user input?

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:54.920
So as you saw, Mini-apps can
take user input and return

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.590
results right in line.

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.240
Second, our dynamic updates.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.210
So Mini-apps, because
they're powered by webhooks,

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:08.530
they can show live content right
on Search and refresh results

00:10:08.530 --> 00:10:10.720
as new information comes in.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.960
And finally, of course,
there's on-surface fulfillment.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:17.440
Mini-apps show right on Search
and right on the Assistant,

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.600
enabling you to put
your best foot forward

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.470
to show users the key aspects
of your product and service

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.278
right on Search
and the Assistant.

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:27.070
But that's not all.

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.670
We know you all have
built wonderful journeys.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:33.430
We don't expect you
to have to recreate

00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:35.680
the full journey on
the search results page

00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.480
or on the Assistant.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.540
If you take a look at that
first one we talked about,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.800
the course exploration
Mini-app example, here the user

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.750
completed the initial steps
of that journey on Search.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:50.770
They found the popular courses
that were interesting for them,

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.530
or they saw those
that were available,

00:10:52.530 --> 00:10:54.610
those that were starting soon.

00:10:54.610 --> 00:10:58.480
But then the Mini-app handed
the user off to your service

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.200
or app to continue and
complete the journey.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.530
Now there may be cases where you
want to offer the most premium

00:11:05.530 --> 00:11:08.110
experience you can and
make sure the user can

00:11:08.110 --> 00:11:10.970
do everything right on
the search results page.

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.000
This case is the
shipping company

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.280
wanted to provide the complete
package-tracking information

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.170
right on Search.

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:20.180
Mini-app can do that, too.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:24.100
So you can help users begin a
crucial piece of their journey

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.590
and get a single thing
done, such as discovering

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.990
the course they
like, or complete

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:32.900
the full journey such as finding
the status of their package.

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:36.220
They're designed to be able
to fit the needs of the users

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:40.360
you need to engage to help them
to get something done on Search

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:42.670
and get a good feel for
your services and products.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:49.550
OK, so I've talked a
little bit about Mini-apps,

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:54.020
how we've designed them, the
key capabilities we have.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.320
We've also built a few.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:57.140
And we wanted to
demonstrate how they feel

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:59.150
and look because one of
the key aspects of them

00:11:59.150 --> 00:12:02.930
is they're really fast and feel
really wonderful on Search.

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.460
So let me pull one up and
demonstrate it in front of you

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:05.960
right now.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.200
So I've got a Pixel 3 here.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.230
And I'm going to make
sure you can see it.

00:12:15.230 --> 00:12:16.220
Great.

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:18.260
So this is a
demonstration Mini-app

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:21.290
that we've put together using
some of the live content

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:23.690
from Coursera.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:26.960
It looks very similar to the
demonstration app I showed.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.910
And it's appearing right here
in the search results page.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:33.060
So in this case, I've looked
for Coursera machine learning.

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:36.140
You see the Mini-app there
appearing among the blue links

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.520
right on Search.

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:38.660
It's fully interactive.

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:43.270
You can swipe around and quickly
see more courses and offerings.

00:12:43.270 --> 00:12:46.100
And I think this
Google Cloud, how

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.220
Google does machine learning
is pretty interesting.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:53.060
I can tap in and I can
quickly get information.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.130
You saw that actually
load in real time.

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.380
That was a webhook
call to actually get

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.860
the content to appear right
on the search results page.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.620
This looks
interesting, but I want

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.980
to look around a
little bit more.

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.830
I can tap in if I want to
filter by TensorFlow because I'm

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:12.770
interested in machine learning
courses about TensorFlow.

00:13:12.770 --> 00:13:15.680
Scroll through and
see what's available.

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.600
Serverless machine learning from
Google Cloud looks interesting.

00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.970
Tap in, get that rich
exploration capability,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.560
tap back to see more courses.

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.270
And even as a user, tap
out, and I'm right back

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.590
on the search results page.

00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:34.370
Now keep in mind
how fluid and fast

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:36.770
this was, cutting
down on frustration

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:39.830
and churn for users,
enabling you to engage them

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.940
right on the surface with live
content and interactivity.

00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:46.580
And once again,
if I wanted to, I

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.980
could tap through on More
Information or Enroll Now

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:53.030
to go directly to
your site or service.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:54.950
Now of course, the
thing I promised

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:59.150
was that these worked on both
Search and the Assistant.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.160
So I'm going to
switch over here.

00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.940
And we've created a
demonstration Mini-app

00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:07.650
on the Google Home Hub as well.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.310
The goal of this is that
the Google Home Hub Mini-app

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.130
is powered by that
same live content that

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.170
powers the search one.

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:17.060
But we've laid out the
content a little bit

00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:20.660
differently just to show how
it's suitable for the Home Hub

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:21.343
as well.

00:14:21.343 --> 00:14:22.760
And Mini-apps can
help you do this

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:24.890
on both Search
and the Assistant.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:26.780
I'll lean in because it's noisy.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:32.150
And we'll see if the Home Hub
can show us Coursera's courses.

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.260
Hey, Google.

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:36.170
Show me machine learning
courses by Coursera.

00:14:41.623 --> 00:14:43.040
GOOGLE ASSISTANT:
Here is the list

00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:44.207
of machine learning courses.

00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:48.090
ALLEN HARVEY: So
you see the same set

00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:52.170
of courses come up, powered
by the same webhook and APIs.

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:55.110
So this is a Mini-app
working on both Search

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:57.240
and working on the Assistant.

00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.830
I can tap in to see
more information,

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:04.700
just like I could
on the Mini-app that

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.590
was appearing on Google Search.

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.630
You see the same
information here.

00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:10.490
It's scrollable.

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.140
Same content appearing
across multiple surfaces.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:19.270
I'll just swipe out
of that to close.

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.690
So in a nutshell,
that's Mini-apps.

00:15:21.690 --> 00:15:25.410
They enable you to create these
rich interactive experiences,

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:27.810
show up right on the
search results page,

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:31.440
and engage users with your
unique content and offerings

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.090
so users know what
you can offer to them.

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:37.650
So let's dig into
how Mini-apps work.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:40.600
I give you an understanding
of how to create one

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.200
and what you can do with them.

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:46.377
All right, so how
do Mini-apps work?

00:15:46.377 --> 00:15:47.460
I'm going to use this one.

00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:49.625
We're going to create a
Hello World Mini-app today.

00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.000
I'm going to walk
you through it,

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.920
and I'll talk through
the pieces of it.

00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.020
This Hello World Mini-app
is fairly simple.

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:57.840
It's got an image there.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.750
It's got some text, an input
box, and an update button.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.390
I wanted to show
off as simply as I

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:07.010
could the input, the real-time
interactivity right on Search

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.930
and the Assistant.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.030
So on this one, you'd
type in your name.

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:13.650
In this case, type
in some input.

00:16:13.650 --> 00:16:15.070
My name is Allen.

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:17.380
Click Update, and the
string will change.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.670
So instead of hello
from Google I/O 2019,

00:16:20.670 --> 00:16:25.020
you'll get hello, Allen,
welcome to Google I/O 2019.

00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.610
So how do they work?

00:16:26.610 --> 00:16:29.310
Mini-apps basically
have two pieces to them.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.050
There's the app itself.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:32.250
We talked about this.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.560
There's the configuration
information.

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.800
There's the user
interface definition,

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.520
and I'll get into that a
little bit in a minute.

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.130
And then there's the
triggering setup.

00:16:41.130 --> 00:16:42.930
So those are the
three main components

00:16:42.930 --> 00:16:44.790
of a Mini-app you define.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:46.590
And then you set
up a webhook that

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:49.980
has the content and business
logic for your Mini-app

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.780
so that when the
Mini-app appears,

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.788
it can call your webhook to
get the latest information

00:16:55.788 --> 00:16:57.330
and to understand
what it should show

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.920
and how it should
show it to the user.

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.640
So a quick demonstration,
when Google Search comes up

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.710
and the Mini-app triggers,
it says, hey, Mini-app.

00:17:09.710 --> 00:17:11.430
I need you to show
on Google Search.

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.790
The Mini-app says to the
webhook, send me your content.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:15.869
Pretty quick and easy.

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.609
The Mini-app turns
around, in our case,

00:17:17.609 --> 00:17:22.010
returns that nice I/O 2019
image, returns the string.

00:17:22.010 --> 00:17:25.140
Mini-app puts it together in
the user interface definition

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.810
and shows it right on
Search or the Assistant.

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.700
Now where do you
go to create them?

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:34.700
So for Mini-apps, they're
created in the Actions console.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.020
And why the Actions console?

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.420
The Actions console
has the ability

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.810
to help you make Mini-apps
that work across surface.

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:45.080
So coming up in the
early access program,

00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:49.220
Mini-apps will work on
Search with quick follow ons

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.280
for smart displays on
Google Assistant as well

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:56.950
as smart display and Google
Assistant on other devices.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:59.080
In addition, in the
Actions console,

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.350
there's basically four easy
steps you follow to create one.

00:18:02.350 --> 00:18:03.880
We talked about this.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.950
You create the
app configuration.

00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:08.890
You define your user
interface for each surface.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.300
You set up triggering.

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.200
And then of course, you specify
the location of your webhook.

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:16.870
All right, I'm going to
walk you through each step.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.020
They're quick and
hopefully pretty simple.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.640
App configuration--
and I'm going

00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:24.800
to use this app, the one
we've been talking about,

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:27.560
the Hello World app, and walk
through a sample configuration

00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.990
with it.

00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:32.320
So in the Actions
console, you'd go in

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.990
and you'd define a quick app
configuration for your app.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:36.080
You set up the name.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.740
We'll call this one the
Google I/O Mini-app.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:42.010
Description, Hello World
Mini-app for Google I/O.

00:18:42.010 --> 00:18:44.080
Since I'm creating it,
the company is Google,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.660
and the URL is Google.com.

00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:49.060
And we'll say for now the
supported languages and regions

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:52.210
are EU and US just
for the simple example

00:18:52.210 --> 00:18:53.620
here in this demo.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.880
And finally, I put an
example webhook URL there

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:01.000
in the configuration.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.590
But a lot of the
magic in Mini-apps

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.568
is from this library of
UI components we offer.

00:19:05.568 --> 00:19:07.360
So I talked about how
do you get a Mini-app

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.270
to show on Search
and the Assistant?

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.100
We've got a complete set
of UI components you use.

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:15.590
And Mini-apps on each
surface need to be Search

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.880
and Assistant UI
and UX compatible.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:20.590
So we've created
these Mini-apps so you

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.420
don't have to sit
there and build

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.470
all new components yourself.

00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:26.740
So we offer a complete
library of components.

00:19:26.740 --> 00:19:29.200
Here I've picked an example few.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:32.410
We've got text components and
carousel components, chips,

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:33.790
buttons, and images.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.325
We try to make it really easy
for you to define the user

00:19:36.325 --> 00:19:37.450
interface of your Mini-app.

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:43.110
For example, here's
if you wanted

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.110
to create the Update button
for our Hello World Mini-app.

00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:49.200
You simply say button,
put in the text,

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.905
put an on-event
handler in there.

00:19:51.905 --> 00:19:53.280
And then you've
got a button that

00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.080
meets Search specifications
and Assistant specifications

00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:59.460
that will appear
right on each surface.

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:01.260
Pretty simple and
easy to say, hey, I

00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:03.330
need an update button
in my Mini-app.

00:20:03.330 --> 00:20:06.390
And when it calls the webhook,
set up some event handlers

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:09.860
so I know what the user did.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:12.470
Of course, we don't want you
to have to redefine your user

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:14.150
interface every time.

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:16.880
You take these set of
components and you package them

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.320
into what we call a UI template.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.400
In this case, I've taken the
same set of four components--

00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.810
an image, a label, an
input box, and some text--

00:20:26.810 --> 00:20:29.600
and we'll package them together
in what we would call our UI

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.340
template for Search.

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.720
This way I can
reuse this template.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.540
I can use it, and
you saw earlier,

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:37.700
Mini-apps have
many pages in them.

00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.770
I could reuse templates
in certain pages

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.770
all to make it so you don't
have to rebuild the same UI

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:43.910
time and time again.

00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:45.980
You can package them
together and use them

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.918
across different surfaces.

00:20:48.918 --> 00:20:50.960
And of course, the same
would apply for something

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.030
such as Assistant.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.800
So you could take
those same components.

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.590
Those components know how
to work on each surface.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:21:00.140
But since each surface has
different capabilities,

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.670
you could lay them out
in a different way.

00:21:02.670 --> 00:21:05.990
Here you see my text image
are now again side by side.

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:08.690
The large text that I
specified is now even larger

00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:11.390
because it knows what to
do right on the Assistant.

00:21:11.390 --> 00:21:15.050
And some of the input boxes have
turned into suggestion chips,

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:17.540
because you can just
speak to the Assistant

00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.730
instead of typing in.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.460
So the goal here is we wanted
to make Mini-apps as simple

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:27.480
as possible to create and set
up to help you engage users

00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.670
on each surface.

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.560
All right, so finally
is triggering.

00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.410
Triggering is where you
get a bit of Google magic

00:21:36.410 --> 00:21:37.580
with Mini-apps.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.590
So here's a really
simple example.

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:42.260
I've wanted to say I want
this Mini-app to show up

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:44.525
on search when somebody
types hello, world

00:21:44.525 --> 00:21:47.370
or hello, Google
I/O. You notice,

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:50.450
I don't have to specify
misspellings or typos.

00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:54.410
A lot of that is taken care of
when you register your Mini-app

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:56.450
for certain query examples.

00:21:56.450 --> 00:21:59.390
And it's neat things
that when Google detects

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.030
that your Mini-app should
show when these examples have

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.640
happened, we'll make sure
that the Mini-app gets

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:07.970
the right inputs from the
user and knows when to appear

00:22:07.970 --> 00:22:12.010
on Search or the Assistant.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:15.220
OK, so Mini-apps are brand new.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.300
So I've walked
through what they are.

00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.750
I've walked through how do you
create one and how they work.

00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:23.840
I'm going to build an example
one right in front of you.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.750
We've got a quick
developer quick start guide

00:22:25.750 --> 00:22:28.150
that I'm going to walk
through and set up a Mini-app

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:32.002
and show you that we
can make one today.

00:22:32.002 --> 00:22:33.460
So I want to walk
you through this.

00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.930
This is very early DevX.

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.780
Mini-apps are brand new from
Google search and the Assistant

00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:38.630
teams.

00:22:38.630 --> 00:22:41.400
So let's get started.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.285
I'm just going to quickly
switch over to my laptop.

00:22:47.010 --> 00:22:50.990
All right, so I've pulled up
Mini-apps developer quick start

00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:52.550
guide here.

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:54.950
What I have going on
is I've got welcome

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:56.810
to developer quick start.

00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:58.880
This helps you get started.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.820
And we've got a developer
console here for Mini-apps.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:05.480
I've created one already with
this Hello World Demo backup.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.330
But I'm going to come in and
use what we have showing here

00:23:08.330 --> 00:23:10.460
to create one.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:13.430
I've got this app
configuration here

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:14.910
that I'm going to
show everybody.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:17.120
So this Mini-app, we
talked about it, right?

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.580
Hello I/O Mini-app, the
Hello World Mini-app.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.710
The providers of my company
will change that to Google.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:26.678
And it will change
that to example.com.

00:23:26.678 --> 00:23:29.280
And right here you can see
the intents I've set up,

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.810
so the Hello World intents.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:33.303
And I've specified the
location of a webhook.

00:23:33.303 --> 00:23:35.220
So I'm just going to
take this really quickly.

00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:41.055
And I'm going to put this
in our console over here.

00:23:41.055 --> 00:23:42.680
And I'm going to
create a new Mini-app.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:44.000
So I've got a
back-up one created,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.375
but I wanted to
create a new one.

00:23:48.758 --> 00:23:51.050
So I'm going to create one
right in front of us, set up

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:52.550
this app configuration.

00:23:52.550 --> 00:23:54.975
So you see the app config
here, Google I/O Mini-app,

00:23:54.975 --> 00:23:55.850
Hello World Mini-app.

00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.010
I'm going to change
this to Google

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.625
since I'm creating this one.

00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:03.520
And I'm just going to click
Save on this Mini-app.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.620
Great, so it says
saved, quick and easy.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.470
Come back here to
the special place,

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:09.820
demo Hello World Mini-app.

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.167
You saw that created.

00:24:11.167 --> 00:24:13.750
Now the next thing I need to do
is define that user interface,

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.080
right?

00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:16.090
So I said there is this
set of components you

00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:18.860
can use to create a Mini-app.

00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:22.280
So I want to define this user
interface really quickly.

00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:26.760
I'm going to come back here
to my developer quick start.

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:28.760
So in the user interface,
what did I say I need?

00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.670
I said I needed some
components, right?

00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.520
The first one was
this image piece here.

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:36.860
So I wanted to show
off this image.

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.630
The second one was
a text block that I

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.960
wanted to show off and put
in a quick line in there.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.360
Then an input button
for the input your name,

00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:47.100
and then a button
to take the update.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:48.980
So I'm going to pull
and take this here.

00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:53.700
And I'm going to
come on over here,

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:58.970
my developer console and define
my user interface template.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:01.060
So this is pretty simple
on the Mini-app, right?

00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.840
I've got my image.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.430
And that image,
you notice, says it

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:07.800
comes from payload.image URL.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.650
This mean your webhook
returning that live content puts

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.810
that image right
in the Mini-app.

00:25:12.810 --> 00:25:15.190
I've got the text block.

00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:20.490
For the Mini-app we wanted to
show the message Hello, World

00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:22.990
or Hello from Google I/O showing
right on the search results

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:24.125
page.

00:25:24.125 --> 00:25:25.750
So I've got payload
and output message.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:28.810
That means pull from the webhook
call, that output message,

00:25:28.810 --> 00:25:30.700
and show it in the Mini-app.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.010
And then we wanted
that input button.

00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:36.190
And remember, for our
app configuration here,

00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:38.530
we're triggering on--

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.903
this webhook I'm
calling in Hello World.

00:25:40.903 --> 00:25:42.820
So I'm going to quickly
go over and test this.

00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.700
And run one more time.

00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:55.500
I'm going to come back here
and make sure that I configured

00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:56.970
everything OK.

00:25:56.970 --> 00:25:57.660
Click Save.

00:26:04.510 --> 00:26:09.140
Hello, World-- looks
like my-- there it goes.

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:11.880
Sorry, a few hiccups
reaching my webhook

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.770
endpoint that I just set up.

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:17.940
So I've got my Hello World
Mini-app working right there.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:19.610
Here's the user
interface I defined.

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:20.490
Here's the image.

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:21.500
Here's the texturing.

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.180
I can type in right
here on Search.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.230
Update that Hello, Allen.

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:28.690
You saw that work right here
live on the search results

00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:29.950
page.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.498
You can see the
request we send out.

00:26:32.498 --> 00:26:33.790
So we talked about this, right?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.310
So it sends out-- here's
the input from that button,

00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:38.057
and the string value is Allen.

00:26:38.057 --> 00:26:39.640
And then you can see
the response that

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.093
comes back from the webhook.

00:26:41.093 --> 00:26:42.760
Hey, the payload,
which we talked about,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:46.983
had that image URL in it and it
had the output message showing.

00:26:46.983 --> 00:26:48.775
So you saw that work
right there on Search.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.780
And I've created a Mini-app.

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:56.693
Now we've also gone and said
so I've got this Cloud function

00:26:56.693 --> 00:26:57.610
webhook that's set up.

00:26:57.610 --> 00:26:59.027
And I'll go into
this in a second.

00:26:59.027 --> 00:27:01.930
But what I've seen is you
see this Mini-app working.

00:27:01.930 --> 00:27:05.500
So we've also created one
that works on the Assistant.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.140
And so I wanted to show
that this webhook powers

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.770
both the Assistant and Search.

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.600
So let me invoke the Mini-app
on the Assistant really quickly.

00:27:18.310 --> 00:27:19.420
Hey, Google.

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.950
Show me the Hello World Demo.

00:27:26.110 --> 00:27:28.510
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hello
from Google I/O 2019.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:29.768
What's your name?

00:27:29.768 --> 00:27:31.060
ALLEN HARVEY: My name is Allen.

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:37.180
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hello, Allen.

00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:41.020
Welcome to Google I/O 2019.

00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:44.260
ALLEN HARVEY: So there you
saw the same application

00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:47.410
working right on Search
and the Assistant.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:49.130
Give me two seconds here.

00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:52.300
I'm going to switch
back to my laptop.

00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:53.800
And one of the
things I wanted to do

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:58.290
is when I created this
Mini-app, I used this image.

00:27:58.290 --> 00:28:00.910
So I used this image
to create my Mini-app.

00:28:00.910 --> 00:28:04.660
But there's also this other
great Google I/O image.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:07.610
And to show you how it
updates in real time,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.352
I'm going to swap over
to this image here.

00:28:10.352 --> 00:28:11.560
So I'm going to go over here.

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.030
I've built this
Cloud function here

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.610
to help us get started easily.

00:28:15.610 --> 00:28:20.710
It's just a simple JSON
takes a request and response.

00:28:20.710 --> 00:28:22.990
And this is what is the
response is coming back

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.910
for the Mini-app.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:25.900
And I'm going to swap
over to this new image.

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:27.490
It's a really quick
simple update.

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:28.990
Here's the image URL.

00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.340
You saw here is the
payload I specified earlier

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:33.310
and returning that image URL.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:36.300
Pretty quick and
simple to update.

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:39.660
Now I'm going to deploy this.

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:41.330
This takes a moment to deploy.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:42.790
So we'll let that deploy.

00:28:42.790 --> 00:28:45.250
But one of the things I
wanted to talk through

00:28:45.250 --> 00:28:49.210
while that's deploying
is what's exciting

00:28:49.210 --> 00:28:51.730
about Mini-apps is you can
also get a quick preview of how

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.350
they'll look on Google Search.

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.950
So we see this View in Google
Search button down here.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.350
I'm going to click this
just while this happens.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:01.395
And you see, hey, look,
showing right there

00:29:01.395 --> 00:29:02.770
in the Google
Search results page

00:29:02.770 --> 00:29:04.510
I can get a nice
preview of my new app,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.000
get a feel for how it'll
show right there on Search.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.480
And this is private to you.

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:11.920
Only you can see
that, but you can

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.620
get a sense of how the
Mini-app is working right

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.577
on Google Search.

00:29:16.577 --> 00:29:17.660
So I'm going to back here.

00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.040
You see this Mini-app working.

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:21.410
I'm going to check in
on my Cloud Function.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:22.160
Still deploying.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.530
It takes a second here.

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:28.480
And come back-- and so
there it is, the preview.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.892
And you could put
anything in here.

00:29:31.892 --> 00:29:34.100
It's just to show that it
can take some live content.

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.170
Right here on Search,
we'll update that, Hello,

00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:41.900
everyone, showing that the
Mini-app can take that input.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.840
Now my web function is deployed.

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:47.780
I'm going to rerun
my Mini-app here.

00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.760
And now you saw the
image change because I

00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:52.410
deployed that new Cloud
Function with the new image.

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:55.730
So we've got the same APIs
powering your Mini-app

00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:58.850
right on search, showing
that they are powered

00:29:58.850 --> 00:30:01.220
by the same webhook
calls that you

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:03.650
saw me modify in that webhook.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:06.170
And now I'm going to switch
back to the Assistant

00:30:06.170 --> 00:30:08.150
because that Assistant
Mini-app is also

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.820
using that same webhook.

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.130
And in the Assistant, you'll see
that the second image updates

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:15.810
because that's where it
expects the payload response.

00:30:15.810 --> 00:30:19.270
So let's see if this
works right for us.

00:30:19.270 --> 00:30:21.880
Hey, Google, show me
the Hello World Demo.

00:30:26.770 --> 00:30:29.170
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hello
from Google I/O 2019.

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:30.188
What's your name?

00:30:30.188 --> 00:30:31.480
ALLEN HARVEY: My name is Allen.

00:30:34.998 --> 00:30:36.290
GOOGLE ASSISTANT: Hello, Allen.

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:38.870
Welcome to Google I/O 2019.

00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:41.120
ALLEN HARVEY: So you see
the image change there?

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.500
I updated in the webhook.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.480
You see the same
webhook response.

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.260
You setup once, powering your
application both on Search

00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:51.230
and on Home Hub, making it
simple to build a Mini-app that

00:30:51.230 --> 00:30:52.220
works across surface.

00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:58.125
All right, let's go
back to the slides.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.210
So Mini-apps-- they
enable developers

00:31:03.210 --> 00:31:05.370
to engage users with
interactive workflows

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:08.220
and live content directly
on Search and Assistant.

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.530
And this is a brand new
early adopters program

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:11.860
that we're talking about today.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.770
This is brand new
from us on Search

00:31:13.770 --> 00:31:15.630
and the Assistant,
brand new ways

00:31:15.630 --> 00:31:20.530
to engage users with interactive
experiences and live content.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:22.870
Remember they've got
three key capabilities

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:24.660
we wanted to introduce.

00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:27.690
They can take and respond
to user input right and line

00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:29.080
on Search.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:33.090
They can show live content as
new updates become available,

00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:37.890
and they enable you to engage
users directly on each surface.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:40.950
And finally, of course,
they have flexible handoff

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:43.560
so that you can direct the
user to the right place

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:45.750
in your service so
that they have the best

00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:46.920
experience on their journey.

00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:53.150
So if you have a
use case or you can

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.450
help a user accomplish a task
or retrieve more information

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.780
in a more delightful way
using these capabilities,

00:31:59.780 --> 00:32:01.770
we want to hear from you.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.490
We want to hear what you
can do with Mini-apps.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:07.970
We built these to enable
you all to engage users

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:12.270
on each surface using these
unique new capabilities.

00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:13.700
So today, I'm
excited to announce

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:17.390
that we're opening up an early
adopters program for Mini-apps.

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:19.640
The submissions are open now.

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.190
And the invitations
are coming in June

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:24.560
for those first submissions.

00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:28.550
Please go to g.co/miniapps
to get started.

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:32.030
As I mentioned, we're really
excited to see what do you all

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:33.710
want to build with Mini-apps?

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.750
How can you all
engage users on Search

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.430
and the Assistant
with Mini-apps?

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:41.470
So thank you so
much for your time.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:45.950
I'm Allen Harvey, and please
visit g.co/miniapps to get

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:46.450
started.

00:32:46.450 --> 00:32:50.290
And tell me what you would
like to create with them today.

00:32:50.290 --> 00:32:51.190
Thanks a lot.

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:55.140
