00:00:20.854 --> 00:00:22.645
PROFESSOR: Let's get
on with some dynamics.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.020
So the place I'm
going to begin is just

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.820
a comment about mechanical
engineering courses.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.010
The first, and you may have
heard this already in classes,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.440
you'll be taking
subject 2001 if you're

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.770
Course 2 majors through
2009, and if you're

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.700
2-A, most of the odd ones.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:57.920
But the subjects
2001 through 2005

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.510
are really basically engineering
science subjects that are all

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.650
foundational to
mechanical engineering,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.780
and they all have a common
or property through them.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.220
And that is that we make
observations of the world,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.340
and we try to understand them.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.610
We pose problems.

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.710
Why-- 400 years ago, is
the sun in the center

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.620
of the solar system or not?

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:32.470
And we try to produce models
that explain the problem.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.530
So here's the problem,
the question of the day.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.460
We try to produce
models to describe it,

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:49.370
and we make observations,
measurements, to see

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.000
if our models are correct.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.540
And if we feed that information
back into the models,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.160
we try out the models, we test
it against more observations,

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.419
and you go round and round.

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:03.960
And this is kind of
the fundamental--

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.630
this is the way all of these
basic first five subjects use,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.140
basically, this
method of inquiry.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.220
So in 2003, the way
this system works,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:29.140
my kind of mental conception
of this modeling process,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.201
is three things.

00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.200
And this applies to you.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.580
You have a homework problem.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.850
How do you attack
a homework problem?

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.690
You're going to need
to describe the motion.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.840
You're going to need to choose
the physical laws-- pick,

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.960
I'll call it
because it's short--

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:59.180
the physical law that
you want to apply

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.210
like f equals ma,
conservation of energy,

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:03.875
conservation of momentum.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:06.590
You got to know which
physical laws to apply.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:16.370
And then finally, third you
need to apply the correct math.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.224
And that's really--
most dynamic problems

00:03:18.224 --> 00:03:19.390
can be broken down this way.

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.530
That's the way I like to
conceptually break them down.

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.300
You might have another
model, but this is

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.450
the way I'm going to teach it.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:28.210
Can you describe the motion,
pick the correct physical laws

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:32.630
to apply to the problem, and
able to do the correct math,

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.260
solving the equation
of motion, for example.

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.550
And all this is what
fits in our models box.

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.400
And we test it against
observations and measurements

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.970
and improve those
things over time.

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.920
So I'm going to give you--
how many of you like history?

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.884
I find history and
history technology

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:54.050
kind of fun and interesting.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.924
So I'm going to throw
a little bit of history

00:03:55.924 --> 00:03:58.320
into giving you a
little quick course

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.000
outline of what we're going to
do in this subject this term.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.150
Because the history
dynamics and what

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.130
we're going to do in the course
actually track one another

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.110
remarkably closely.

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.410
So if I ever gave you a bunch
of names like Galileo, Kepler,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.280
Descartes, Newton, Copernicus,
Euler, Lagrange and Brahe,

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280
which one comes first?

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.384
Take a guess.

00:04:38.384 --> 00:04:40.764
AUDIENCE: Copernicus.

00:04:40.764 --> 00:04:41.940
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.440
Copernicus.

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.260
So Copernicus was
Polish, and the story

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:58.550
starts long before then, but
in about 1,500 Copernicus

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:00.618
said what?

00:05:00.618 --> 00:05:01.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:04.346 --> 00:05:06.230
PROFESSOR: The sun's the center?

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.950
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.625
PROFESSOR: Or the
Earth is the center?

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:10.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.430
PROFESSOR: Which did say?

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.320
Yes, so Ptolemy, back
around 130 AD said,

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.050
well the Earth's the
center of the solar system.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.720
Copernicus came
along and said, nope

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.080
I think that, in fact, the sun's
the center of the solar system.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.042
And it for the next 100 years--
more than 100 years, couple

00:05:27.042 --> 00:05:29.250
hundred years-- there was
a really raging controversy

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.250
about that.

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.520
So Copernicus, Brahe
Kepler-- so I'm

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.520
putting them in rough
chronological order here.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.995
Now, I'm going to
run out of board.

00:05:41.995 --> 00:05:42.710
Oh well.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:06:23.130
Galileo, Descartes-- I'm gonna
cheat-- OK, Descartes, Newton,

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.580
Euler, and Lagrange.

00:06:30.795 --> 00:06:33.420
So we're going to talk and say
a little bit about each of them.

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.955
And now that I'm--
like I told you,

00:06:34.955 --> 00:06:37.330
I haven't used this classroom
before so I gotta learn how

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.740
to play this game.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.780
I need to be able to
reach this for a minute.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.900
So Brahe, he was
along about 1,600.

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.450
Brahe was the
mathematician that wrote--

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.060
the imperial mathematician
to the emperor in Prague.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.530
And he did 20 years
of observations.

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:57.020
And he was out to prove
that the Earth was

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.190
the center of the solar system.

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.460
And then Kepler actually worked
with him as a mathematician,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:07.250
and then took over as the
imperial mathematician.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:12.160
And he took Brahe's data--
20 years of astronomical data

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.370
without the use
of the telescope--

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:20.720
and used it come up with the
three laws of planetary motion.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.130
And so his first and second
laws were put out about 1609.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.650
And one of the laws
is, like, equal area

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:30.160
swept out in equal time.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.330
Have you hear that one?

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.620
That actually turns out to be
a statement of conservation

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:37.100
of angular momentum, which
we'll talk quite a bit

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:38.960
about the course.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.520
Then came Galileo, and I'm not
putting their birth and death

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.020
dates here.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:45.700
I'm kind of putting
in a period of time

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.070
in which kind of important
things happened around him.

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:54.670
So 401 years ago a really
important thing happened.

00:07:54.670 --> 00:08:00.460
Galileo, in 1609, turned
the telescope on Jupiter,

00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.192
and saw what?

00:08:02.192 --> 00:08:03.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:03.104 --> 00:08:05.420
PROFESSOR: Four moons, right?

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.060
And then they really
started having some data

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:12.000
with which to really argue
against the Ptolymaic view

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.840
of the solar system.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.095
Descartes is an
important figure to us.

00:08:21.095 --> 00:08:26.950
And in the period of about
1630 to 1644-- in that period

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:32.809
Descartes began what is today
known as analytic geometry.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.130
He was geometer, he
studied Euclid a lot.

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:40.110
But then he came up with a
Cartesian coordinate system,

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.370
xyz, and the beginnings
of analytic geometry,

00:08:43.370 --> 00:08:47.790
which is essentially algebra,
coordinates, and geometry all

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:48.540
put together.

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.170
And we are going to make
great use of analytic geometry

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.830
in this course.

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:59.433
Then came Newton, kind of in
his actual lifespan, 1643.

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:04.070
It's kind of interesting
that he spans these people.

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:10.174
And in about 1666 is when he
first-- the first statement

00:09:10.174 --> 00:09:11.340
of the three laws of motion.

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:30.430
Then Euler, and he's 1707 to
1783, and that's his lifespan.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.780
Euler came up-- Newton never
talked about angular momentum.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.260
He mostly talked
about particles.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:40.950
Euler put Newton's three
laws into mathematics.

00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:44.810
Euler taught us about
angular momentum,

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:53.140
and torque being dh
dt in most cases.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:55.630
He's the most prolific
mathematician all time,

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:58.230
solved all sorts of
important problems.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:00.410
And then finally, is Lagrange.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:08.740
And Lagrange, in about 1788,
uses an energy method, energy

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:17.140
and the concept of work to
give us equations of motion.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:24.940
So the course, 203,
stands on the shoulders

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:26.140
of all these people.

00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.810
But with Descartes, we start
with kinematics, really.

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:33.350
This is analytic geometry.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:36.200
And that's where we're going to
start today is with kinematics.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.840
And very soon
thereafter, we're going

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.210
to review Newton, the
three laws, and what

00:10:40.210 --> 00:10:45.400
we call the direct method for
finding equations of motion.

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.020
Conservation of
momentum, fact that

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:50.070
force-- some of the
forces on an object

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:53.390
equals mass times acceleration,
or it's a time derivative

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:55.730
of its linear momentum.

00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:59.350
And we use that to derive
equations of motion.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:05.490
So we're going to go kinematics
into doing the direct method

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:09.580
to getting equations of motion.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.750
And we go from there
into angular momentum,

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:18.500
and what Euler gave us--
the same thing, torque.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.840
We're going to do quite a
lot with angular momentum.

00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.020
Because I know you know
a lot about f equals ma

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.380
and you've done lots of
problems 801 applying that.

00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:30.960
You've done some problems
on rigid body rotations.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.084
But I think there's
a lot more you

00:11:33.084 --> 00:11:34.750
need to understand
about this, and we'll

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:36.083
spend quite a bit of time on it.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:42.280
And then near the
last third the course

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:47.800
we shift, because Lagrange said
that if you just write down

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:53.030
expressions for energy,
kinetic and potential energy,

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:57.340
without any consideration
of Newton's laws

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.769
and the direct method, you can
derive the equations of motion.

00:12:01.769 --> 00:12:02.810
That's pretty remarkable.

00:12:02.810 --> 00:12:06.200
So there are actually two
independent roots to coming up

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:07.650
with equations of motion.

00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:10.400
And in this course, about
the last third of the course,

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.400
we're going to teach
you about Lagrange.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.320
And then all these
things are going

00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.522
to be-- one of the applications
that are important engineers

00:12:20.522 --> 00:12:21.605
is the study of vibration.

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:28.540
So we'll be looking
at vibration examples

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.250
as we go through the
course, and applying

00:12:32.250 --> 00:12:36.090
these different methods
to first, modeling,

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.455
and then solving interesting
vibration problems.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.980
Which brings-- ah, I
have a question for you.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.270
So how many of you were
in this classroom last May

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:49.060
with Professor Haynes Miller,
and I showed up one day

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.420
and we talked about vibration?

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:52.220
How many remember?

00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:54.480
I told you I was going to
ask this question, right?

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.000
Great.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.670
OK, it's good to
see you here again,

00:12:57.670 --> 00:13:01.400
and we will talk about
vibration in this course.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.750
So there's kind of the
subject outline built

00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:07.350
on the shoulders of
these people in history

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.400
that made important
contributions to dynamics.

00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:17.790
Any questions about the history?

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:19.920
If you want to
know, one of my TAs

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.590
compiled a pretty
neat little summary.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.880
Maybe I will see if I
go back and find this.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.810
I just printed out and
sent it-- how many of

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:29.018
you like to know a little
bit more about the history?

00:13:29.018 --> 00:13:31.194
These are like two
liners on each person.

00:13:31.194 --> 00:13:31.860
Anybody want it?

00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:33.580
Is it worth my time
to send this out?

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.450
OK, it's kind of fun.

00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:45.980
So let's do an example of this
modeling describing the motion,

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.760
picking physical laws,
applying the math.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:55.150
And that'll get us
launched in the course.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.890
And we'll do it using Newton
and the direct method.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:24.760
So last May, Haynes Miller
and I talked about vibration.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:27.400
So I'm going to start
with a vibration problem.

00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.310
And I brought one.

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.370
So here's my couple
of lead weights

00:14:35.370 --> 00:14:37.262
and a couple of springs.

00:14:37.262 --> 00:14:39.720
So really I just want to talk
about-- this is the problem I

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.960
want to talk about.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.560
Now you've done
this problem before.

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.480
Haynes Miller and
I did it last May.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:48.870
And you've no doubt
it in other classes.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.830
OK, it's a system which
has a spring, a mass,

00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:54.310
it exhibits something
called a natural frequency.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:58.220
But let's see what it takes
to just initially begin

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:03.410
to follow this modeling
method to arrive

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:05.160
at an equation of
motion for this problem.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:17.930
So what do I mean by when
I say, describe the motion?

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:19.590
Really what that
boils down to if you

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:23.240
have to assign a
coordinate system

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.419
so that you can actually say
where the object's moving.

00:15:26.419 --> 00:15:27.710
And I'm going to pick one here.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:30.980
So here's-- coordinate system
going to be really important

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:31.660
in this course.

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:41.670
And I'll give us an xyz
Cartesian coordinate system.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:48.250
And I'm going to try to adopt
the habit, for the most part,

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.960
during the course that
this o marks this origin,

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.340
but it also names the frame.

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.650
So we're going to
talk about things

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:58.860
in that are reference frames.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.500
And most important
one that we need

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:04.080
to know about in the course is
an inertial reference frame,

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.250
and when you can use
it, and when a system

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:08.210
is inertial and is not.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.691
So I'm gonna say that
this is inertial.

00:16:10.691 --> 00:16:11.690
It's fixed to the Earth.

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:12.960
It's not moving.

00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:17.250
And we're going to use this
coordinate x to describe

00:16:17.250 --> 00:16:19.110
the motion of this mass.

00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:31.560
And the motion is going to be--
this x is from the zero spring

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.850
force position.

00:16:33.850 --> 00:16:35.440
It's actually quite
important that you

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.230
pick-- that you
have to say what's

00:16:38.230 --> 00:16:42.580
the condition in the spring
of the system when x is 0

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:44.300
So we're going to say
it's, when there's

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.841
no force in the
spring means it's not

00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:48.782
stretch, that's where 0 is.

00:16:48.782 --> 00:16:50.490
So we've established
a coordinate system.

00:16:55.370 --> 00:16:57.630
Second, we need to
apply physical laws.

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:11.800
Now, I'm going to do
this problem by f equals

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.680
ma, Newton's second law.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:16.190
Sum of the external
forces is equal to mass

00:17:16.190 --> 00:17:17.740
times the acceleration.

00:17:17.740 --> 00:17:21.460
So that's the law
I'm going to apply.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:25.700
Sum of the external
forces, it's a vector

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.640
but we're just doing the x
component only so we don't have

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.930
to carry along vector notation,
is equal to, in this case,

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.350
mass times acceleration.

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:38.520
So that's the law
we're going to apply.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:44.975
And then finally the math to
solve the equation of motion

00:17:44.975 --> 00:17:46.970
that we find, that'll
be the third piece.

00:17:46.970 --> 00:17:49.090
But part of applying
the physics, in order

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:57.230
to do this now, we need
what I call an FBD.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:17:58.602
What do you suppose that is?

00:17:58.602 --> 00:17:59.810
AUDIENCE: Free body diagrams.

00:17:59.810 --> 00:18:01.400
PROFESSOR: Free body diagrams.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.140
You've used these
many times before,

00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.950
so we're going to do those.

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:10.210
And free body diagrams--

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:12.780
And I'm going to
teach you, at least

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.960
the way I go about doing
free body diagrams,

00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:17.150
as things get more
and more complicated,

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:20.280
you're going to have to be
more sophisticated in the way

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.350
that you do these things.

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:25.750
So I just have some
simple little rules

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.610
to do free body diagrams that
keep you from getting hung up

00:18:29.610 --> 00:18:31.480
on sign conventions.

00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.940
I think the thing people
make most mistakes about is

00:18:33.940 --> 00:18:36.030
they get confused about signs.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:39.390
So I'll try to show
you how I do it.

00:18:39.390 --> 00:18:54.540
So first you draw forces
that you know, basically

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:56.720
in the direction
in which they act.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.150
Seems obvious.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:07.115
So when you know
the direction-- so

00:19:07.115 --> 00:19:08.490
this is a really
trivial problem,

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:17.590
but the method here
is very specific.

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:18.780
So what's an example?

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.070
Well, gravity.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:23.960
So we'll start our
free body diagram.

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.490
Gravity acts at
the center of mass.

00:19:26.490 --> 00:19:27.550
It's downward.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:29.970
This is what I mean by the
direction in which it acts.

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:34.120
And it has magnitude, mg.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.740
OK.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:38.220
Now the other forces
aren't so obvious.

00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:41.050
The force that's put on by
the stiffness and this damper

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:43.600
in the spring, which
way do you draw them?

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.370
What's the sign?

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.950
What's the sign convention?

00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.560
So the convention, the way I
go about doing these things,

00:19:49.560 --> 00:20:08.900
is I assume positive values for
the deflections and velocities.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.960
So in this case, x and x dot.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:16.530
You just require that the
deflections that you're going

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:18.920
to work with are positive.

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:20.650
And then from the
positive deflection,

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.660
you say which way is
the resulting force?

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:25.650
So if the deflection
in this is downwards,

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:29.540
which direction is the force
that the spring applies

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:32.020
to the mass?

00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:32.690
Up, right?

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.660
What about if the
velocity is downwards,

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.360
which direction is the force
is the damper puts on the mass?

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.080
Also up, right?

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:42.580
OK.

00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:48.720
So this allows-- this gives us--
so here's f spring and here's

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.070
the f damper.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:53.610
And other any other
forces on this mass?

00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:57.190
So spring force, damper force,
and the gravitational force.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:18.385
And so third, you deduce
the signs basically

00:21:18.385 --> 00:21:19.760
from the direction
of the arrows.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:28.470
First we need what's called
your constitutive relationship.

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.600
So the spring force,
fs, well you've

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.370
made x positive so
it keeps things nice,

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:41.340
the spring constant's a
positive number, so fs is kx.

00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:45.430
Fd is bx dot.

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.440
And now we write the
statement that the sum

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:49.755
of forces in the x direction.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:55.000
We look at up here, we
say well that's going

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.680
to fs plus fd minus mg.

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.360
So that's-- whoops, I wrote
it the wrong way around.

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:10.170
Minus, minus, plus.

00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:12.170
Because I'm plus
downwards, right?

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:18.430
Well, spring minus fs
is minus kx minus bx dot

00:22:18.430 --> 00:22:24.809
plus mg equals mx double dot.

00:22:24.809 --> 00:22:26.600
And I rearranged this
to put all the motion

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.720
variables on one side.

00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:37.700
mx double dot plus bx
dot plus kx equals mg.

00:22:40.350 --> 00:22:43.670
So there's my equation of
motion, but with a method

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.710
for doing the free
body diagrams, which

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.684
will work with multiple bodies.

00:22:47.684 --> 00:22:49.850
So you have two bodies with
springs in between them.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:52.740
This is when the
confusion really comes up.

00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:55.940
Two bodies with a spring
trapped between them.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.490
What's the sign convention?

00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:59.540
You do the same thing.

00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:02.870
Both bodies exhibit
positive motions,

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:05.747
the force that results is
proportional to the difference,

00:23:05.747 --> 00:23:06.580
and you work it out.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.100
And you'll get the signs right.

00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:09.940
OK, so here's our
equation of motion arrived

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.720
at by doing the direct method.

00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:21.130
And if we went on to the
third step, which we're not

00:23:21.130 --> 00:23:24.570
going to do today, and
that is apply the math,

00:23:24.570 --> 00:23:27.430
it might because I want you now
to describe the motion for me,

00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:28.520
solve for the motion.

00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:30.570
That means solving the
differential equation.

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.600
And that's what we did last
may in Haynes Miller's class.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.560
We'll come back
to this later on.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:40.547
But for today's purposes,
we don't need to go there.

00:23:40.547 --> 00:23:42.130
Got something else
much more important

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:45.270
to get to about kinematics.

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:47.610
But I want to show
you one thing,

00:23:47.610 --> 00:23:51.700
and that is just a little
tiny introductory taste

00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:54.480
to this point.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.390
So I've derived the
equation of motion of this

00:23:57.390 --> 00:24:00.854
by Newton's laws.

00:24:00.854 --> 00:24:02.270
But I'm going to
ignore Newton now

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:04.144
and saw I'm going to
drive equation of motion

00:24:04.144 --> 00:24:04.950
by another way.

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:07.470
And it's an energy
technique, and that is-- well

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.020
let's talk about the total
energy of the system.

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.750
It's going to be the
sum of a kinetic energy

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.920
and a potential energy.

00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.290
And we'll find that even
with Lagrange, there's

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:24.400
a problem with forces
on systems that

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.430
are what we call
non-conservative,

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:28.840
things that either take
energy out of, or put energy

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:29.710
into the system.

00:24:29.710 --> 00:24:31.850
And the dashpot does that.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.469
Dashpot generates heat and
takes energy out of the system.

00:24:35.469 --> 00:24:37.510
So I'm going to have to
ignore it for the moment.

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.750
So the sum of the kinetic
and the potential energies

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:45.680
in this problem is
a 1/2 kx squared

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:53.040
for the potential of the spring,
plus a 1/2 mx dot squared

00:24:53.040 --> 00:25:00.600
for the kinetic energy of
the mass, and minus mgx

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.880
for the potential energy that
is due to the object moving

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:07.230
in the gravitational field.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:11.460
And that's the total
energy of the system.

00:25:11.460 --> 00:25:14.490
Now my problem, I've
allowed no forces.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:15.740
There's no excitation on here.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:18.085
This is just free
vibration only.

00:25:18.085 --> 00:25:20.460
That's all we're talking about,
make initial displacement

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:22.530
and it vibrates.

00:25:22.530 --> 00:25:24.410
If there's no
damping, what can you

00:25:24.410 --> 00:25:28.884
say about the total
energy of the system?

00:25:28.884 --> 00:25:30.198
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:30.198 --> 00:25:31.464
PROFESSOR: Say it again.

00:25:31.464 --> 00:25:32.380
I heard it over there.

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:33.800
It's got to be constant, right?

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:37.480
All right, well, so
this must be constant.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:55.200
Therefore, the time derivative
of my system, it better be 0.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.890
The energy is constant.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.860
Take it's time derivative,
it's got to be 0.

00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:00.610
Apply that to the
right-hand side of this,

00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:13.460
I get kxx dot plus mx dot
x double dot minus mgx dot

00:26:13.460 --> 00:26:15.530
equals zero.

00:26:15.530 --> 00:26:23.690
And I now cancel out the
common x dot terms go away.

00:26:23.690 --> 00:26:37.580
And I'm left with--
and I've essentially

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.600
solved for the equation
of motion of this system

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.010
without ever looking at
conservational momentum,

00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:46.695
Newton's laws, only by
energy considerations.

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.570
OK, so that's a
very simple example

00:26:52.570 --> 00:26:55.350
of that you can use energy to
derive equations of motions.

00:26:55.350 --> 00:27:00.840
But you then have to go back and
fix it to account for the loss

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:01.977
term, the damping term.

00:27:01.977 --> 00:27:04.060
And that you still have
to consider it as a force,

00:27:04.060 --> 00:27:04.800
we'll find out.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.920
Even was Lagrange you have to go
back and consider the work done

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.050
by external forces.

00:27:13.050 --> 00:27:15.320
OK.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.010
So you've just kind of
seen the whole course.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:19.390
We've described
the motion, we've

00:27:19.390 --> 00:27:24.090
applied to Newton's laws, the
physics to the direct method

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:26.360
to derive the
equations of motion,

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:31.540
we have gone to a direct method,
and have derived the equations

00:27:31.540 --> 00:27:32.660
of motion that way.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.290
And that's basically what you're
going to do in the course.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.630
But now you're going
to do it with much more

00:27:37.630 --> 00:27:39.880
sophisticated tools.

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:42.160
You'll have multiple
degree of freedom systems.

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.520
The description
describing the motion,

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.230
is maybe going to
be for some of you,

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.410
the most challenging
part of the course.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.615
And this is a topic
we call kinematics.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:59.380
And that's what
we'll turn to next.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.420
So reference frames and vectors.

00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.840
That's the topic.

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:20.110
This is now that we're
talking about kinematics,

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.610
and this is all about
describing the motion.

00:28:24.610 --> 00:28:29.330
So Descartes gave us the
Cartesian coordinate system,

00:28:29.330 --> 00:28:30.340
and we'll start there.

00:28:30.340 --> 00:28:34.080
So imagine this
is a fixed frame--

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.600
we'll talk about what
makes an inertial frame

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.300
the next lecture.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.840
But here we have
an inertial frame.

00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:51.620
And it's the frame we'll
call O-xyz or O for short.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:29:05.720
And in this frame, maybe this
is me, and up here is a dog,

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:12.840
and I'm going to call this
point A and this point B.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:18.190
And I'm going to describe the
positions of these two points

00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:19.890
by vectors.

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:24.050
This one will be R, and the
notation that I'm going to use

00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:30.330
is point and it's measurement
with respect something.

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:34.980
Well, it's with respect to this
point O in this inertial frame.

00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:38.910
So this is A with respect
O is the way to read this.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.310
There's another vector here.

00:29:41.310 --> 00:29:47.440
This is RB respect
to A And finally,

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:53.190
R of B with respect to O They're
all vectors on the board.

00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:55.660
I'll try to remember
to underline them

00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:56.860
in the textbooks and things.

00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.420
They're usually-- vectors
are noted with bold letters.

00:30:03.970 --> 00:30:07.930
And vectors allow us
to say the following.

00:30:07.930 --> 00:30:13.180
That R, the position of
the dog and the reference

00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.690
with respect to O, is the sum
of these other two vectors.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:26.390
R of A with respect to O plus
R R of B with respect to A.

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:29.200
And mostly to do
dynamics we're really

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.040
interested in things like
velocities and accelerations.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:34.010
So to get the velocities
and accelerations,

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:39.095
we have to take a time
derivative of our RBO dt.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:45.840
And that's going to give us
what we'll call the velocity,

00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:48.040
obviously you write
it as V. And it would

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:53.060
be the velocity of point B with
respect to O. And no surprise,

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:58.970
it'll be the velocity of
point A plus the velocity of B

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:04.330
with respect to A.

00:31:04.330 --> 00:31:13.200
And finally, if we take two
derivatives, dt squared,

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:17.690
we'll get the acceleration
of B with respect to O.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:22.730
And that'll be the sum of
A-- the acceleration of A

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:28.880
with respect to O plus
the acceleration of B

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.420
with respect to A.
All, again, vectors.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:41.502
Now, just to look ahead--
this seems all really trivial.

00:31:41.502 --> 00:31:43.210
You guys are going to
sleep on me, right?

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:52.460
If these are rigid bodies, this
is a rigid body that is moving

00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.360
and maybe rotating.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:01.370
And B is on it, and A is
on it, and O isn't on it.

00:32:01.370 --> 00:32:05.000
It starts getting
a little tricky.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And this, the derivative
of a vector that's attached

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:19.220
to the body somehow has to
account for the fact that

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:23.530
if I'm-- the
observer's on the body,

00:32:23.530 --> 00:32:25.010
this other point's on the body.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:28.550
Say it's, I'm on this asteroid,
and I've got a dog out there,

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.000
and the dog's run away from me.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.460
The speed of the dog with
respect to me, I can measure.

00:32:36.460 --> 00:32:37.949
But if I'm down
here looking at it,

00:32:37.949 --> 00:32:39.740
it'll look different
because it's rotating.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:41.198
So how do you
account for all that?

00:32:41.198 --> 00:32:44.810
So taking these derivatives
of vectors in moving frames

00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:48.590
is where the devil's
in the details.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:54.190
And that's part of what I'm
going to be teaching you.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.620
OK.

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:59.065
I'm still learning how
to optimize my board use.

00:32:59.065 --> 00:33:00.940
I haven't got it perfect
yet, but because I'm

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.898
having to move around a
lot here and improvise.

00:33:02.898 --> 00:33:04.670
But we'll persevere.

00:33:04.670 --> 00:33:09.160
You need to remember a
couple things about vectors,

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.916
how to add them, dot products.

00:33:13.916 --> 00:33:15.290
If you've forgotten
these things,

00:33:15.290 --> 00:33:18.469
you need to go back and
review them really quickly.

00:33:18.469 --> 00:33:20.510
There's usually a little
review section the book,

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:22.301
so you need to practice
that sort of thing.

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.710
Couple other little facts
you need to remember.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:32.687
So the derivative of
the sum of two vectors

00:33:32.687 --> 00:33:34.145
is just the sum of
the derivatives.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.180
And quite importantly,
we're going

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:48.170
to make use of this one
a lot, is the derivative

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.760
of a product of two things.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:53.340
One of them be in a vector,
some function maybe of time

00:33:53.340 --> 00:34:01.840
and a here is derivative of
f with respect to t times a,

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:11.139
plus the derivative of a
with respect to t times f.

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:12.750
That we'll make a lot use of.

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.350
So just your basic calculus.

00:34:16.350 --> 00:34:20.070
So now, I want to take up--
let's talk about the simplest

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:22.690
form of being able to
do these derivatives

00:34:22.690 --> 00:34:27.429
and calculate these
velocities, when everything's

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:33.199
described in terms of
Cartesian coordinates.

00:34:33.199 --> 00:34:36.946
Now I'm going to give you a
little look ahead because I'm

00:34:36.946 --> 00:34:42.620
going to try to avoid confusion
as much as possible here.

00:34:42.620 --> 00:34:47.204
The hardest problem is
when you have a rigid body,

00:34:47.204 --> 00:34:49.570
you got the dog on it, you've
got the observer on it,

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:52.300
it's rotating, and translating.

00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:56.260
And to take this derivative, you
end up with a number of terms.

00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.470
The simplest problem
is just something

00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:00.410
in a fixed Cartesian
coordinate system.

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:02.240
So we're going to start
with a simple one,

00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.239
and build our way up to
the complicated one, OK?

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.650
But let's now, we're going to
do the really, the simplest one.

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:15.050
We're going to do
velocity and acceleration

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.980
in Cartesian coordinates.

00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:29.750
And basically I should say
fixed Cartesian coordinates,

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.410
not moving.

00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.900
All right, so now let's
consider the dog out here,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:42.840
and his position in the
Cartesian coordinate system.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.620
And I could write
that and you'll,

00:35:45.620 --> 00:35:48.250
without any loss of
generality here, you'll

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:52.427
know what I mean if
I say RBx component.

00:35:52.427 --> 00:35:54.260
And I'm going to stop
writing the slash O's,

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:57.320
because this is now all in
this fixed reference frame.

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.080
And it's in I-hat direction.

00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:10.590
And I've got another component,
RBy in the J-hat, and an RBz

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.344
in the K-hat.

00:36:13.344 --> 00:36:15.010
And I want to take
the time derivative--

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:16.301
I was looking for the velocity.

00:36:16.301 --> 00:36:18.680
I want to calculate
the velocity.

00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:25.175
So the velocity here of
BNO is d by dt of RBO.

00:36:25.175 --> 00:36:28.070
.

00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:31.200
And now this is now the
product of two things,

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.950
so I've got to use
that formula over here.

00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:35.960
Product one turn times
the other, and so forth.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:39.330
So I go to these,
and I say OK, so this

00:36:39.330 --> 00:36:53.690
is R dot Bx times I plus R
dot By times J plus R dot

00:36:53.690 --> 00:37:00.610
Bz times K. And then the other--
the flip side of that is I

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:06.650
have to take the derivatives of
I times RBx, the derivative J

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.810
and so forth.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:10.940
But what's the derivative
of, let's say, I?

00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:15.380
Capital I is my unit vector
in the fixed reference

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.795
frame, my O-xyz frame.

00:37:17.795 --> 00:37:19.045
0 So it's a constant.

00:37:19.045 --> 00:37:23.390
It is unit length, and it points
in a direction that it's fixed.

00:37:23.390 --> 00:37:25.240
So what's its derivative?

00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:26.990
It's going to have
a 0 derivative.

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.770
So the second part of this--
second bits of that is zero.

00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:36.480
So that's the velocity in
Cartesian coordinates of my dog

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:40.750
out there running around.

00:37:40.750 --> 00:37:43.477
And the acceleration,
in a similar way,

00:37:43.477 --> 00:37:45.810
now to get the acceleration,
you take another derivative

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:46.309
of this.

00:37:46.309 --> 00:37:48.920
And again, you'll have to take
derivatives of I, J, and K,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.620
and again they're going to be 0.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:57.300
So you will find that the
acceleration then, is just R

00:37:57.300 --> 00:38:02.910
double dot x term
in the plus R double

00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:10.485
dot By in the J plus r
double dot Bz in the K.

00:38:10.485 --> 00:38:12.610
That would be our acceleration
term, and it's easy.

00:38:20.219 --> 00:38:22.760
Now imagine that we are doing
this in polar coordinates, unit

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.390
vectors in polar coordinates.

00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:27.350
Let me check, last year
the students told me

00:38:27.350 --> 00:38:30.110
that in your
physics courses, you

00:38:30.110 --> 00:38:34.380
use unit vectors R-hat,
theta-hat, and K. Is

00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:35.450
that right?

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:38.580
So I'll use those unit
vectors so they look familiar,

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.090
because in polar
coordinates people

00:38:40.090 --> 00:38:41.760
use lots of different things.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.710
But think about it, in
polar coordinates, theta--

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:48.460
it's a fixed, maybe,
coordinate system,

00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:54.020
but now theta goes like this
and R moves with theta, right?

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.550
So the unit vector
is pointing here,

00:38:55.550 --> 00:38:58.070
but over time it might
move down to here.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:01.710
And unit vector has
changed direction,

00:39:01.710 --> 00:39:04.210
and its derivative in
time is no longer 0.

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:06.810
So it starts getting messy
as soon as the unit vectors

00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.680
change in time.

00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:10.690
And so that's one of
our objectives here

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:12.420
is to get to that
point and describe

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.130
how you handle those cases.

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:51.460
So a quick point about velocity.

00:39:51.460 --> 00:39:54.250
You need to really understand
what we mean by velocity.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:40:00.010
So here's our Cartesian system.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:05.300
Here's this point out
here B. And now, this

00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.070
is the dog running around,
and the path of the dog

00:40:10.070 --> 00:40:14.440
might have been like this.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.885
And right in here he's
going this direction.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:30.800
And in a little
time, in delta t,

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:38.610
he moves by an amount
delta RB with respect to O.

00:40:38.610 --> 00:40:41.100
And that's what this is.

00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.015
He's moved this little
bit in time delta t.

00:40:44.015 --> 00:40:46.320
And he happens to be going
off in that direction.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.450
So this then is R
prime, I'll call it,

00:40:49.450 --> 00:40:53.790
of B with respect to O, and this
is our original RB with respect

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:59.780
to O. So we can say that
his new position, RB

00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:09.030
with respect to prime
is RBO plus delta R.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:10.550
And these are all vectors.

00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:24.332
And the velocity of
B with respect to O

00:41:24.332 --> 00:41:32.800
is just equal to this limit
of delta RBO over delta t

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:37.740
as t goes to 0.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.520
So what direction
is the velocity?

00:41:43.858 --> 00:41:47.410
The velocity is in the
direction of the change, not

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:50.600
the original vector, it was in
the direction of the change.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.580
And in fact, if
the path of the dog

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:58.310
is like this, at the instant
you compute the velocity,

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.710
you're computing the tangent
to the path of the dog.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.950
So that's what velocity
is at any instant time

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:06.990
is a tangent to the path.

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.650
And that's a good
concept to remember.

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:53.400
So we're still in this
fixed Cartesian space,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.190
and I have of couple of points.

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.250
I'll make it really
trivial here.

00:42:57.250 --> 00:43:04.820
Here's B, and here's A,
and the velocity of B--

00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:05.590
where's my number?

00:43:09.950 --> 00:43:13.920
We'll make this 10
feet per second.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:19.300
And it's in the J-hat direction.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:25.610
And A, this is the
velocity of BNO.

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:33.190
The velocity of ANO, we'll
say is 4 feet per second,

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.270
also in the J direction.

00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:38.590
And I want to know what's the
velocity of B with respect

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:44.005
to A. So now I'm chasing
the dog, he's running at 10,

00:43:44.005 --> 00:43:47.460
I'm running at 4.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:50.060
How do I perceive
the speed of the dog?

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.170
Well, to do this
in vectors, which

00:43:52.170 --> 00:43:54.420
is the point of
the exercise here,

00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:58.000
is we have the expressions
we started with over there.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.370
And we're going to use
these a lot in the course.

00:44:00.370 --> 00:44:04.120
So the velocity of
B with respect to O

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.730
is the velocity
of A with respect

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:09.520
to O plus the velocity
of B with respect to A.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:12.140
And if I want to know velocity
of B with respect to A,

00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:12.990
I just solve this.

00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:22.540
So velocity of B with respect
to O minus the velocity of A

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:26.340
with respect to O, and in
this case that's 10 minus 4

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:32.380
is 6 in the J.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.470
Point of the exercise is
to manipulate the vector

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.930
expressions like this.

00:44:36.930 --> 00:44:39.220
So take whatever known
quantities you have

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:40.470
and solve for the unknown one.

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:42.553
In this case, I want to
know the relative velocity

00:44:42.553 --> 00:44:44.490
between the two, and it's this.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:53.620
If I'm here, and I'm
watching the dog,

00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:57.110
that's how I perceive the speed
of the dog relative to me,

00:44:57.110 --> 00:44:58.200
right?

00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.180
6 feet per second
in the J direction.

00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:05.510
What's the speed of the dog from
the point of view of over here?

00:45:05.510 --> 00:45:09.570
The speed of the
dog relative to me.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:17.140
So it's again the velocity
of B with respect to A,

00:45:17.140 --> 00:45:22.300
but from a different position
in this fixed reference frame.

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:31.740
Really important
point, actually.

00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.085
This is a really important
conceptual point.

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.570
Somebody be bold.

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.490
What's the speed
with respect to O?

00:45:40.490 --> 00:45:44.570
The velocity of B with
respect to A seen from O,

00:45:44.570 --> 00:45:48.074
as computed from O, measured
from O. Got radar down there,

00:45:48.074 --> 00:45:49.115
and you're tracking them.

00:45:54.065 --> 00:45:56.045
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:56.045 --> 00:45:59.470
PROFESSOR: In what direction?

00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:04.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.110
It's the same.

00:46:06.110 --> 00:46:09.160
The point is it's the same.

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:15.740
If you're in a fixed reference
frame, a vector of velocity

00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:20.760
is the same as seen from
any point in the frame.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:23.680
Any fixed point in the frame
of velocity is always the same.

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.140
And in fact, in this case, the
velocity-- this is a moving

00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:30.820
point and the velocity
of him with respect to me

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:33.590
this is different
six feet per second.

00:46:33.590 --> 00:46:35.570
And I, from here,
say the velocity

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:39.140
of that guy with respect to this
guy is still 6 feet per second.

00:46:39.140 --> 00:46:43.930
Any place in that
frame or even any point

00:46:43.930 --> 00:46:45.470
moving at constant
velocity, you're

00:46:45.470 --> 00:46:47.955
going to see the same answer.

00:46:47.955 --> 00:46:50.740
So it doesn't
matter where you are

00:46:50.740 --> 00:46:54.510
to compute the velocity
of B with respect to A.

00:46:54.510 --> 00:46:57.011
That's the important point.

00:46:57.011 --> 00:46:57.510
OK.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:15.550
OK, we got to pick up with,
and I may not quite finish,

00:47:15.550 --> 00:47:22.795
but I am going to introduce
the next complexity.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:41.460
OK.

00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:06.120
So what we just
arrived at a minute ago

00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.590
is that the velocity
as seen from O

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:13.220
is the same as the velocity
as seen from A. And A is me,

00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:15.140
and I'm moving, and
I'm chasing the dog.

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:18.295
So I'm a moving
reference frame, I'm

00:48:18.295 --> 00:48:20.590
what's called a translating
reference frame.

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.490
So now we're going to
take the next step.

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.890
We had a fixed reference
frame before purely,

00:48:24.890 --> 00:48:26.390
and now I want to
talk about having

00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:28.680
the idea, the concept of
having a moving reference

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.200
frame within a fixed one.

00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:35.571
So this is the reference
frame O capital XYZ.

00:48:35.571 --> 00:48:37.820
And this little reference
frame now is attached to me,

00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.050
and it's A, and I call
it x-prime y-prime.

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:43.360
So just so you can--
it's going to be

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.910
hard to tell this X from this
X if I don't do something

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:49.860
like a prime.

00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:52.990
So that this is the concept of
a translating coordinate system

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:56.410
attached to a body, like
a rigid body, for example.

00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:59.180
We're going to do lots of
rigid body dynamics here.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.720
And within this
coordinate system,

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:05.759
I can compute the velocity
of B with respect to A,

00:49:05.759 --> 00:49:07.300
and I'll get exactly
the same answer.

00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.930
I'll get that 6 feet per
second in the J direction.

00:49:10.930 --> 00:49:14.340
So it's as if-- so
this concept of being

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.110
able to have a reference
frame attached to a body

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:20.220
and translating with it, you
can measure things within it,

00:49:20.220 --> 00:49:24.160
get the answer, and then
convert that answer to here

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.780
if you're using a
different coordinate.

00:49:27.780 --> 00:49:31.070
You could use polar coordinates
here and rectangular here,

00:49:31.070 --> 00:49:33.610
but they still can be
related to one another.

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:34.830
We'll do problems like that.

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.820
OK.

00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:51.340
So now what I'm doing is I
told you like in the readings,

00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:56.740
the end game is to be able
to talk about translating

00:49:56.740 --> 00:49:59.510
and rotating bodies,
and do dynamics

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:01.950
in three dimensions with
translating and rotating

00:50:01.950 --> 00:50:03.090
objects.

00:50:03.090 --> 00:50:07.740
And we're going to get
there somewhat step by step.

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:10.390
But I want you to
understand the end game

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.950
so you know where we're going.

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:14.110
And you need to have a
couple of concepts in mind.

00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:23.950
So the first concept is that
this is a rigid body now.

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:27.800
And you can describe the
motion of rigid bodies

00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:34.360
by the summation, the
combination of a translation

00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.410
and a rotation.

00:50:36.410 --> 00:50:39.680
And of the rigid body, if you
can describe its translation,

00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.510
and you can describe
its rotation,

00:50:41.510 --> 00:50:43.430
you have the complete motion.

00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:47.470
So you got to understand what
do we mean by what's really

00:50:47.470 --> 00:50:49.700
the definition of translation.

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:53.096
So translation--
so I've got this--

00:50:53.096 --> 00:50:55.450
I'll call it a merry-go-round.

00:50:55.450 --> 00:50:58.510
We'll use a merry-go-round
example in a minute.

00:50:58.510 --> 00:51:01.845
And you're observers in
a fixed inertial frame

00:51:01.845 --> 00:51:05.140
up above this
merry-go-round looking down.

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:06.640
OK.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.890
But so you can see it, I
got to turn it on its side.

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:11.680
So here's my merry-go-round.

00:51:11.680 --> 00:51:13.840
And if it's not
rotating, but let's

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:20.320
say it's sitting on a train,
on a flat bed and moving along.

00:51:20.320 --> 00:51:22.360
It's translating.

00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:24.620
And when you say
a body translates,

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:31.510
any two points on the body
move in parallel paths.

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:33.844
So two points, my
thumb and my finger--

00:51:33.844 --> 00:51:35.260
if I'm just going
along with this,

00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.510
those two paths are traveling
parallel to one another.

00:51:40.780 --> 00:51:50.180
If I got Y pointing
up, the body does this,

00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:52.605
is it rotating and translating?

00:51:52.605 --> 00:51:53.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:59.095
PROFESSOR: Are any two points
on a moving in parallel paths?

00:51:59.095 --> 00:52:00.050
Right?

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:01.200
OK.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.800
When it goes through
curved things,

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.090
it's called curvilinear
translation.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:07.220
But it's still just translation.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.200
OK, so I'll stop
and hold steady.

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:13.620
The train stopped, and
the thing-- let it rotate.

00:52:13.620 --> 00:52:17.200
So that's pure rotation.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.340
And the thing to remember
about pure rotation

00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:26.372
is that anywhere on the body
rotates at the same rate.

00:52:26.372 --> 00:52:29.800
If this is going
around once a second,

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.880
the rotation rate
is one rotation

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.450
per second, 360 degrees,
2 pi radians per second

00:52:35.450 --> 00:52:37.180
is its rotation rate.

00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.710
Every point on the body
experiences the same rotation

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:40.950
rate.

00:52:40.950 --> 00:52:42.760
That's a really important
one to remember.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.640
If I'm holding still,
merry-go-round's

00:52:48.640 --> 00:52:53.300
going round and round, it has a
fixed axis of rotation, right?

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:58.590
But do rotating bodies have to
have fixed axes of rotation?

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:07.605
So if I throw that up in the
air, not hanging onto it,

00:53:07.605 --> 00:53:11.200
it's got gravity acting
on it, it's rotating.

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:12.675
What's a rotate about?

00:53:12.675 --> 00:53:13.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:13.550 --> 00:53:15.180
PROFESSOR: Center of mass, OK.

00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:18.570
Is the center of mass moving?

00:53:18.570 --> 00:53:21.700
So this is clearly-- this
is an example of rotation

00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:22.580
plus translation.

00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:28.660
It rotates about an axis
but the axis can move.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.099
That's another important
concept that we

00:53:31.099 --> 00:53:33.390
have to allow in order to be
able to do these problems.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.410
But this is now
general motion, it's

00:53:35.410 --> 00:53:38.050
a combination of
translation and rotation,

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.329
and we figure out each
of those two pieces,

00:53:40.329 --> 00:53:42.620
then we can describe the
complete motion of the system.

00:53:47.140 --> 00:53:57.660
All right, where we'll pick up
next time is then doing that.

00:53:57.660 --> 00:53:59.076
And it would help
actually, if you

00:53:59.076 --> 00:54:03.570
go read that reading,
especially up to chapter 16,

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:07.700
we have to get into to taking
derivatives of vectors which

00:54:07.700 --> 00:54:10.700
are rotating, and come
up with a general formula

00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:13.680
allows us to do velocities
and accelerations

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:14.660
under those conditions.

00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:18.940
See you on Tuesday next.
