it's not hundreds of years old like the
other branches we're thinking about what

00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:13.540
other branches we're thinking about what
 

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:15.870
other branches we're thinking about what
are our standards to allow other people

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:15.880
are our standards to allow other people
 

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:17.490
are our standards to allow other people
to replicate the work what are our

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:17.500
to replicate the work what are our
 

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.150

what science is truly about a core and
 

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:27.930
what science is truly about a core and
how do we how do we create these

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:27.940
how do we how do we create these
 

00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:29.520
how do we how do we create these
standards and how do we promulgate them

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:29.530
standards and how do we promulgate them

guidelines this is really what they're

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:35.980
guidelines this is really what they're
 

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.320
guidelines this is really what they're
telling you about data management plans

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.330
telling you about data management plans
 

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.190
telling you about data management plans
so I think this so my impression is that

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:41.200
so I think this so my impression is that
 

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.270
so I think this so my impression is that
this is left perfect purposefully vague

this is left perfect purposefully vague
 

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.390
this is left perfect purposefully vague
there's a very close relationship

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:47.400
there's a very close relationship
 

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.190
there's a very close relationship
between how and SF thinks and how the

researchers think and I think NSF is
 

00:14:55.089 --> 00:14:57.900

rightly wary of being too far ahead of
 

00:14:57.910 --> 00:14:59.699
rightly wary of being too far ahead of
where researchers are so there's this

00:14:59.699 --> 00:14:59.709
where researchers are so there's this
 

00:14:59.709 --> 00:15:01.440
where researchers are so there's this
symbiotic relationship where one will

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:01.450
symbiotic relationship where one will
 

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.280

sort of push another if you think about

00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:05.290
sort of push another if you think about
 

00:15:05.290 --> 00:15:06.630
sort of push another if you think about
what it takes if you've ever done

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:06.640
what it takes if you've ever done
 

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.220
what it takes if you've ever done
computational work and you think about

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:08.230
computational work and you think about
 

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.990
computational work and you think about
what it takes to share the code and the

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.000
what it takes to share the code and the
 

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.440
what it takes to share the code and the
data that you use to

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.450
data that you use to
 

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:14.260
data that you use to
your work it's a non-trivial problem

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:14.270
your work it's a non-trivial problem
 

00:15:14.270 --> 00:15:16.030
your work it's a non-trivial problem
right for a number of reasons that

00:15:16.030 --> 00:15:16.040
right for a number of reasons that
 

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:17.560
right for a number of reasons that
probably are popping into your head and

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:17.570
probably are popping into your head and
 

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.290
probably are popping into your head and
some of those reasons probably pertain

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:20.300
some of those reasons probably pertain
 

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.060
some of those reasons probably pertain
to the type of data and the field that

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:22.070
to the type of data and the field that
 

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.110
to the type of data and the field that
you're in and are very domain-specific

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:25.120
you're in and are very domain-specific
 

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.300
you're in and are very domain-specific
so it's difficult for NSF to just come

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:28.310
so it's difficult for NSF to just come
 

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.180
so it's difficult for NSF to just come
down in a heavy-handed way and say you

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:31.190
down in a heavy-handed way and say you
 

00:15:31.190 --> 00:15:32.800
down in a heavy-handed way and say you
have to share a code and data I mean

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:32.810
have to share a code and data I mean
 

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:34.780
have to share a code and data I mean
that's all so vague what does that mean

00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:34.790
that's all so vague what does that mean
 

00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:39.160
that's all so vague what does that mean
is it dated from your raw gather data

00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.170
is it dated from your raw gather data
 

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:41.530
is it dated from your raw gather data
that then you filter is this data that's

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:41.540
that then you filter is this data that's
 

00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.150
that then you filter is this data that's
come from other sources and what's the

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:43.160
come from other sources and what's the
 

00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.340
come from other sources and what's the
provenance where do I share it NSF

00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:45.350
provenance where do I share it NSF
 

00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:46.810
provenance where do I share it NSF
hasn't told me where there's a site

where i can and am I expected to put
 

00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:50.050
where i can and am I expected to put
that on my webpage and what about the

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:50.060
that on my webpage and what about the
 

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.750
that on my webpage and what about the
code like how much and does the guy on

code like how much and does the guy on
 

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.130

we talking about here is it just other
research so there's a lot of these

00:15:59.290 --> 00:15:59.300
research so there's a lot of these
 

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.870
research so there's a lot of these
questions that I think there's not a

computational research itself is

computational research itself is
changing and how we do it so this is

changing and how we do it so this is
 

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.290

this is purposefully vague and NSF

00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:14.300
this is purposefully vague and NSF
 

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.960
this is purposefully vague and NSF
doesn't say anything like we need to see

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:16.970
doesn't say anything like we need to see
 

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:18.790
doesn't say anything like we need to see
that you're going to be open with the

that you're going to be open with the
 

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.080
that you're going to be open with the
data the idea here is there just

data the idea here is there just
 

00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:24.490

fact-finding at this point they want to

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:24.500
fact-finding at this point they want to
 

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:26.950
fact-finding at this point they want to
see what researchers write down where

00:16:26.950 --> 00:16:26.960
see what researchers write down where
 

00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:30.490
see what researchers write down where
the bottlenecks are where what the

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:30.500
the bottlenecks are where what the
 

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.040
the bottlenecks are where what the
thinking is and in a way you can gather

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.050
thinking is and in a way you can gather
 

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.470
thinking is and in a way you can gather
a fair amount of information about data

00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:35.480
a fair amount of information about data
 

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.330
a fair amount of information about data
sharing practices and how researchers

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:37.340
sharing practices and how researchers
 

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.070
sharing practices and how researchers
view data sharing and what the problems

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:39.080
view data sharing and what the problems
 

00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.230
view data sharing and what the problems
might actually be just from asking for

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:41.240
might actually be just from asking for
 

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:43.390
might actually be just from asking for
these two pages so at this stage my

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:43.400
these two pages so at this stage my
 

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:45.160
these two pages so at this stage my
understanding is in some sense it

00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:45.170
understanding is in some sense it
 

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:46.480
understanding is in some sense it
doesn't really matter what your even you

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:46.490
doesn't really matter what your even you
 

00:16:46.490 --> 00:16:47.800
doesn't really matter what your even you
can write that you can't share the data

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:47.810
can write that you can't share the data
 

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.460
can write that you can't share the data
or the data are you know always been

00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:51.470
or the data are you know always been
 

00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:54.490
or the data are you know always been
open and there's no problem um there

00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:54.500
open and there's no problem um there
 

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.040
open and there's no problem um there
isn't really any standards at NSF is

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:57.050
isn't really any standards at NSF is
 

00:16:57.050 --> 00:16:59.620
isn't really any standards at NSF is
expecting of the researchers that's my

00:16:59.620 --> 00:16:59.630
expecting of the researchers that's my
 

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:01.480
expecting of the researchers that's my
impression so that you know like I said

00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:01.490
impression so that you know like I said
 

00:17:01.490 --> 00:17:04.120
impression so that you know like I said
I'm just a person so I didn't smell my

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:04.130
I'm just a person so I didn't smell my
 

00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:05.949
I'm just a person so I didn't smell my
policy but but that's what that's what I

00:17:05.949 --> 00:17:05.959
policy but but that's what that's what I
 

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:07.960
policy but but that's what that's what I
think and I think that SF actually has a

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:07.970
think and I think that SF actually has a
 

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.640
think and I think that SF actually has a
wonderful opportunity here for collating

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:12.650
wonderful opportunity here for collating
 

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.560
wonderful opportunity here for collating
the information that comes in on these

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:14.570
the information that comes in on these
 

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:16.210
the information that comes in on these
data management plans and find out where

00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.220
data management plans and find out where
 

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:17.439
data management plans and find out where
what's going on in the research

00:17:17.439 --> 00:17:17.449
what's going on in the research
 

00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:19.420
what's going on in the research
community I think this is not cheap

00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:19.430
community I think this is not cheap
 

00:17:19.430 --> 00:17:21.400
community I think this is not cheap
right for people to share code and share

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:21.410
right for people to share code and share
 

00:17:21.410 --> 00:17:22.060
right for people to share code and share
data

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:22.070
data
 

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:25.390
data
and there may be hesitation about costs

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:25.400
and there may be hesitation about costs
 

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.680
and there may be hesitation about costs
and what it would take to underwrite

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:26.690
and what it would take to underwrite
 

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.630
and what it would take to underwrite
this and you know if people talk about

00:17:28.630 --> 00:17:28.640
this and you know if people talk about
 

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.510
this and you know if people talk about
what it costs and put that information

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:31.520
what it costs and put that information
 

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.610
what it costs and put that information
into their grant applications they can

00:17:33.610 --> 00:17:33.620
into their grant applications they can
 

00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:34.990
into their grant applications they can
actually start to get a handle on this

00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000
actually start to get a handle on this
 

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.700
actually start to get a handle on this
so I think this can be very valuable at

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:36.710
so I think this can be very valuable at
 

00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:40.090
so I think this can be very valuable at

fact I know there or not so um so that's

00:17:47.890 --> 00:17:47.900
fact I know there or not so um so that's
 

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.570
fact I know there or not so um so that's
that's the the overview of the data

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:49.580
that's the the overview of the data
 

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.960
that's the the overview of the data
management plan it may be a step forward

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:52.970
management plan it may be a step forward
 

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:54.760
management plan it may be a step forward
towards something more but right now

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:54.770
towards something more but right now
 

00:17:54.770 --> 00:17:56.290
towards something more but right now
it's not it's just something that comes

up it is peer reviewed so it is

00:17:57.820 --> 00:17:57.830
up it is peer reviewed so it is
 

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.160
up it is peer reviewed so it is
something that the NSF is allowing to

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.170
something that the NSF is allowing to
 

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:02.050
something that the NSF is allowing to
devolve to the communities to evaluate

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:02.060
devolve to the communities to evaluate
 

00:18:02.060 --> 00:18:03.910
devolve to the communities to evaluate

and and come up with their own standards
 

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.790
and and come up with their own standards
and in my opinion that's exactly right i

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:06.800
and in my opinion that's exactly right i

italicize here including digital data so

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:48.369
italicize here including digital data so
 

00:25:48.369 --> 00:25:50.369
italicize here including digital data so
now the data discussion is actually in

00:25:50.369 --> 00:25:50.379
now the data discussion is actually in
 

00:25:50.379 --> 00:25:53.700
now the data discussion is actually in
legislation and and there's talk about

00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:53.710
legislation and and there's talk about
 

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:55.259
legislation and and there's talk about
well how do we share this how do we

00:25:55.259 --> 00:25:55.269
well how do we share this how do we
 

00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:56.580
well how do we share this how do we
curate this how do we make it available

00:25:56.580 --> 00:25:56.590
curate this how do we make it available
 

00:25:56.590 --> 00:25:59.969
curate this how do we make it available
for a long amount of time and they're

00:25:59.969 --> 00:25:59.979
for a long amount of time and they're
 

00:25:59.979 --> 00:26:01.049
for a long amount of time and they're
also talking about peer-reviewed

00:26:01.049 --> 00:26:01.059
also talking about peer-reviewed
 

00:26:01.059 --> 00:26:03.930

scholarly publications and so on section

00:26:03.930 --> 00:26:03.940
scholarly publications and so on section
 

00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:07.139
scholarly publications and so on section
104 i mentioned mandates at the office

00:26:07.139 --> 00:26:07.149
104 i mentioned mandates at the office
 

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:08.789
104 i mentioned mandates at the office
of science technology policy in the

00:26:08.789 --> 00:26:08.799
of science technology policy in the
 

00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:09.169

including online access and long-term

00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:18.369
including online access and long-term
 

00:26:18.369 --> 00:26:21.089
including online access and long-term
preservation of such collections so they

00:26:21.089 --> 00:26:21.099
preservation of such collections so they
 

00:26:21.099 --> 00:26:22.649
preservation of such collections so they
don't specifically mention data there

00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:22.659
don't specifically mention data there
 

00:26:22.659 --> 00:26:24.330
don't specifically mention data there
but they are cognizant of the fact that

00:26:24.330 --> 00:26:24.340
but they are cognizant of the fact that
 

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.549
but they are cognizant of the fact that
we are moving online and we need to be

00:26:26.549 --> 00:26:26.559
we are moving online and we need to be
 

00:26:26.559 --> 00:26:28.019
we are moving online and we need to be
able to access digital and electronic

00:26:28.019 --> 00:26:28.029
able to access digital and electronic
 

00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:31.499
able to access digital and electronic
works and with section 103 this should

00:26:31.499 --> 00:26:31.509
works and with section 103 this should
 

00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:33.570
works and with section 103 this should
include data and I'm hoping that the

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:33.580
include data and I'm hoping that the
 

00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:35.279
include data and I'm hoping that the
discussion of code is subsumed in the

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:35.289
discussion of code is subsumed in the
 

00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:37.349
discussion of code is subsumed in the
discussion of data as well as as you as

00:26:37.349 --> 00:26:37.359
discussion of data as well as as you as
 

00:26:37.359 --> 00:26:38.549
discussion of data as well as as you as
I mentioned earlier I think it's a

00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559
I mentioned earlier I think it's a
 

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.940
I mentioned earlier I think it's a
mistake to talk about data in isolation

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:40.950
mistake to talk about data in isolation
 

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.529
mistake to talk about data in isolation
okay Oh actually in the interest of time

00:26:43.529 --> 00:26:43.539
okay Oh actually in the interest of time
 

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:45.539
okay Oh actually in the interest of time
I'll skip by doll act but this certainly

00:26:45.539 --> 00:26:45.549
I'll skip by doll act but this certainly
 

00:26:45.549 --> 00:26:49.259
I'll skip by doll act but this certainly
has many intellectual property

00:26:49.259 --> 00:26:49.269
has many intellectual property
 

00:26:49.269 --> 00:26:51.180
has many intellectual property
ramifications as we share code and with

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:51.190
ramifications as we share code and with
 

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:53.299
ramifications as we share code and with
shared data were also pulled by

00:26:53.299 --> 00:26:53.309
shared data were also pulled by
 

00:26:53.309 --> 00:26:55.889
shared data were also pulled by
incentive structures that have been in

00:26:55.889 --> 00:26:55.899
incentive structures that have been in
 

00:26:55.899 --> 00:26:58.169
incentive structures that have been in
place since 1980 from the bayh-dole Act

00:26:58.169 --> 00:26:58.179
place since 1980 from the bayh-dole Act
 

00:26:58.179 --> 00:26:59.279

work developed at the institution and
 

00:27:05.399 --> 00:27:07.830
work developed at the institution and
what I will point out is that the

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840
what I will point out is that the
 

00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:09.690
what I will point out is that the
bayh-dole Act notice it was passed in

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:09.700
bayh-dole Act notice it was passed in
 

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:11.999

nineteen eighty nobody had any idea of
 

00:27:12.009 --> 00:27:13.649
nineteen eighty nobody had any idea of
what was going to happen with computers

00:27:13.649 --> 00:27:13.659
what was going to happen with computers
 

00:27:13.659 --> 00:27:15.239
what was going to happen with computers
and with science and with the Internet

00:27:15.239 --> 00:27:15.249
and with science and with the Internet
 

00:27:15.249 --> 00:27:16.680

at that point they were thinking about a
 

00:27:16.690 --> 00:27:18.659
at that point they were thinking about a
wholly different world and so now with

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:18.669
wholly different world and so now with
 

00:27:18.669 --> 00:27:22.109
wholly different world and so now with

there's all sorts of discussion
happening often independently there's

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.080
happening often independently there's
 

00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.440
happening often independently there's
not a lot of communication about this

00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:13.450
not a lot of communication about this

so easy so we're trying to look across
these different disciplines and

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:10.760
these different disciplines and

really critical aspect of data curation

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:24.890
really critical aspect of data curation
 

00:32:24.890 --> 00:32:26.890
really critical aspect of data curation
and I'll talk a little bit more about

00:32:26.890 --> 00:32:26.900
and I'll talk a little bit more about
 

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:31.240
and I'll talk a little bit more about
that but the key takeaway for you is

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:31.250
that but the key takeaway for you is
 

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:34.120
that but the key takeaway for you is
that we believe preparing data and

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.130
that we believe preparing data and
 

00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:35.590
that we believe preparing data and
building an infrastructure and a

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600
building an infrastructure and a
 

00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:37.330
building an infrastructure and a
framework for preservation actually

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:37.340
framework for preservation actually
 

00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:40.450
framework for preservation actually
fosters a lot of reuse of data a lot of

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:40.460
fosters a lot of reuse of data a lot of
 

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:42.730
fosters a lot of reuse of data a lot of
sharing and I'd like to believe actually

00:32:42.730 --> 00:32:42.740
sharing and I'd like to believe actually
 

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.750
sharing and I'd like to believe actually
transparency and reproducibility now in

00:32:46.750 --> 00:32:46.760
transparency and reproducibility now in
 

00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.549
transparency and reproducibility now in
that spirit I want to share this slide

00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559
that spirit I want to share this slide
 

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:50.650
that spirit I want to share this slide
and I won't spend a whole lot of time on

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:50.660
and I won't spend a whole lot of time on
 

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:53.020
and I won't spend a whole lot of time on
it but I do think it's important to draw

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:53.030
it but I do think it's important to draw
 

00:32:53.030 --> 00:32:54.850
it but I do think it's important to draw
this distinction between archiving

00:32:54.850 --> 00:32:54.860
this distinction between archiving

this distinction between archiving
preservation and curation we sometimes

00:32:56.890 --> 00:32:56.900
preservation and curation we sometimes
 

00:32:56.900 --> 00:33:00.160
preservation and curation we sometimes
use the terms interchangeably and we

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.170
use the terms interchangeably and we
 

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.260
use the terms interchangeably and we
think of them very differently in the

00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:02.270
think of them very differently in the
 

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.480
think of them very differently in the
data Conservancy context and this is a

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:04.490
data Conservancy context and this is a
 

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.310
data Conservancy context and this is a
very deliberate representation from the

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320

have preservation which is actually the

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:05.300
very quickly is that if you're dealing
 

00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:07.600
very quickly is that if you're dealing
with different disciplines data models

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:07.610
with different disciplines data models
 

00:36:07.610 --> 00:36:10.000

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:12.490
get pushed around quite a bit it's very
hard to imagine to come up with one data

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:12.500

lots of different disciplines we seem to

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:17.690
lots of different disciplines we seem to
 

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:20.170
lots of different disciplines we seem to
be drifting migrating evolving however

you want to think about it to the idea

00:36:22.150 --> 00:36:22.160
you want to think about it to the idea
 

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.710
you want to think about it to the idea
of supporting multiple data models

00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:23.720
of supporting multiple data models
 

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.690
of supporting multiple data models
rather than trying to take one and

rather than trying to take one and
 

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:28.180

stretch it too far we were beginning to

stretch it too far we were beginning to
 

00:36:28.190 --> 00:36:29.890

that there will be multiple data models

that there will be multiple data models
 

00:36:31.610 --> 00:36:34.030
that there will be multiple data models
and that begs the question then how are

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:34.040
and that begs the question then how are
 

00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:35.350

extraction framework it's really a
 

00:36:43.850 --> 00:36:46.240

two-step process so if you have some

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:46.250
two-step process so if you have some
 

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:48.340
two-step process so if you have some
sort of format registry in place and you

00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:48.350
sort of format registry in place and you
 

00:36:48.350 --> 00:36:51.100
sort of format registry in place and you
can assert that this is this particular

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:51.110
can assert that this is this particular
 

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:53.350

kind of format and these are its salient
 

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.780
kind of format and these are its salient
properties then you can extract useful

00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:55.790
properties then you can extract useful
 

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:58.030

00:39:31.610 --> 00:39:31.620
and said we'd like to work together to
 

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.050
and said we'd like to work together to
do this and I think this is a really

00:39:33.050 --> 00:39:33.060
do this and I think this is a really
 

00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.450
do this and I think this is a really
important point to make the service that

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:35.460
important point to make the service that
 

00:39:35.460 --> 00:39:37.460
important point to make the service that
we've developed is run by the libraries

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:37.470
we've developed is run by the libraries
 

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.590
we've developed is run by the libraries
but we don't think of it as a library

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:39.600
but we don't think of it as a library
 

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.150
but we don't think of it as a library
service this is part of the research

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:41.160
service this is part of the research
 

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:44.060
service this is part of the research
support structure at Johns Hopkins so

00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:44.070
support structure at Johns Hopkins so
 

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:45.910
support structure at Johns Hopkins so
there are research compliance dimensions

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920
there are research compliance dimensions
 

00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:48.770
there are research compliance dimensions
there are reducing the burden on p

00:39:48.770 --> 00:39:48.780
there are reducing the burden on p
 

00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:50.270
there are reducing the burden on p
eyes there's producing better data

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280
eyes there's producing better data
 

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.310
eyes there's producing better data
management plans there's avoiding the

00:39:52.310 --> 00:39:52.320
management plans there's avoiding the
 

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.450
management plans there's avoiding the
kinds of things that you heard about

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:53.460
kinds of things that you heard about
 

00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:56.270
kinds of things that you heard about
that happened at Duke so it's come

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280
that happened at Duke so it's come
 

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:58.520
that happened at Duke so it's come
together into this larger framework of

00:39:58.520 --> 00:39:58.530
together into this larger framework of
 

00:39:58.530 --> 00:40:00.410
together into this larger framework of
how do you support researchers at a

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:00.420
how do you support researchers at a
 

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:02.690
how do you support researchers at a
research institution and how do you do

00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700
research institution and how do you do
 

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.640
research institution and how do you do
so in a way that reduces the burden yet

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:04.650
so in a way that reduces the burden yet
 

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.160
so in a way that reduces the burden yet
also produces better results both in

00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:07.170
also produces better results both in
 

00:40:07.170 --> 00:40:09.530
also produces better results both in
terms of the specific plan and then

00:40:09.530 --> 00:40:09.540
terms of the specific plan and then
 

00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:11.120
terms of the specific plan and then
actually the implementation of those

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.130
actually the implementation of those
 

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:13.910
actually the implementation of those
plans so I'm glad to say that the

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920
plans so I'm glad to say that the
 

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.230
plans so I'm glad to say that the
administration is actually stepped

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240
administration is actually stepped
 

00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.730
administration is actually stepped
forward and said okay we need to fund

00:40:16.730 --> 00:40:16.740
forward and said okay we need to fund
 

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:20.030
forward and said okay we need to fund
this independently of the NSF award so

00:40:20.030 --> 00:40:20.040
this independently of the NSF award so
 

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.280
this independently of the NSF award so
this service that's being run now does

00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:22.290
this service that's being run now does
 

00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.140
this service that's being run now does
not take advantage of any of the funding

00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:24.150
not take advantage of any of the funding
 

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:25.730
not take advantage of any of the funding
that we have through NSF it's being

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:25.740
that we have through NSF it's being
 

00:40:25.740 --> 00:40:28.100
that we have through NSF it's being
funded completely through the university

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.110
funded completely through the university
 

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:31.520
funded completely through the university
itself now I should point out there two

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:31.530
itself now I should point out there two
 

00:40:31.530 --> 00:40:34.730
itself now I should point out there two
stages to this particular service one is

that particular service post award we

00:40:59.660 --> 00:40:59.670
that particular service post award we
 

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:01.370
that particular service post award we
have a decision point basically which is

00:41:01.370 --> 00:41:01.380
have a decision point basically which is
 

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:02.840
have a decision point basically which is

by the institution post award it's part
 

00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.840
by the institution post award it's part
of the proposal budget and then of

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:29.850
of the proposal budget and then of
 

00:41:29.850 --> 00:41:32.540
of the proposal budget and then of
course we'd have to work out wonderful

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:32.550
course we'd have to work out wonderful
 

00:41:32.550 --> 00:41:34.160
course we'd have to work out wonderful
things like retention schedules and

00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:34.170
things like retention schedules and
 

00:41:34.170 --> 00:41:39.680
things like retention schedules and
selection criteria and so on these are

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:39.690
selection criteria and so on these are
 

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:41.810

more context about this particular
 

00:41:43.530 --> 00:41:46.250
more context about this particular
service the first one basically talks

00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260
service the first one basically talks
 

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:48.380
service the first one basically talks
about the process we went through well

00:41:48.380 --> 00:41:48.390
about the process we went through well
 

00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:50.900
about the process we went through well
very broadly speaking we just looked at

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:50.910
very broadly speaking we just looked at
 

00:41:50.910 --> 00:41:53.720
very broadly speaking we just looked at
supply and demand quite frankly as I'd

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:53.730
supply and demand quite frankly as I'd
 

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:56.600
supply and demand quite frankly as I'd
mentioned we've been working with the

00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:56.610
mentioned we've been working with the
 

00:41:56.610 --> 00:41:58.730
mentioned we've been working with the
research administration at Hopkins so we

00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:58.740
research administration at Hopkins so we
 

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.590
research administration at Hopkins so we
were able to get access

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:00.600
were able to get access
 

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.290
were able to get access
to the pis of NSF proposals for the past

00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:03.300
to the pis of NSF proposals for the past
 

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.570
to the pis of NSF proposals for the past
five years we ran a survey with them and

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:05.580
five years we ran a survey with them and
 

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:06.980
five years we ran a survey with them and
ask them what kind of day do you produce

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:06.990
ask them what kind of day do you produce
 

00:42:06.990 --> 00:42:08.660
ask them what kind of day do you produce
how much what are you doing with it now

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:08.670
how much what are you doing with it now
 

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.540
how much what are you doing with it now
where is it things of that nature made

00:42:11.540 --> 00:42:11.550
where is it things of that nature made
 

00:42:11.550 --> 00:42:13.910
where is it things of that nature made
forecasts estimates based on how much

00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920
forecasts estimates based on how much
 

00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.190
forecasts estimates based on how much
data we thought people might need to put

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200
data we thought people might need to put
 

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:19.250
data we thought people might need to put
into the archive and then on our side we

00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260
into the archive and then on our side we
 

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:21.590
into the archive and then on our side we
used experience that we have with data

00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:21.600
used experience that we have with data
 

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:23.330
used experience that we have with data
like Sloan or dry valleys and said it

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:23.340
like Sloan or dry valleys and said it
 

00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.550
like Sloan or dry valleys and said it
takes about this much time we think to

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:25.560
takes about this much time we think to
 

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:27.200
takes about this much time we think to
do these particular sets of activities

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:27.210
do these particular sets of activities
 

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.000
do these particular sets of activities
put all that together and came up with

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:29.010
put all that together and came up with
 

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:31.850
put all that together and came up with
the financial model the details of the

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:31.860
the financial model the details of the
 

00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:34.250
the financial model the details of the
service itself are described in that

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260
service itself are described in that
 

00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.740
service itself are described in that
second URL it actually has a lot of

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:36.750
second URL it actually has a lot of
 

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:38.300
second URL it actually has a lot of
information about good data management

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:38.310
information about good data management
 

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:40.190
information about good data management
practices as well but if you look at

00:42:40.190 --> 00:42:40.200
practices as well but if you look at
 

00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:41.870
practices as well but if you look at
that you can see what services are

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880
that you can see what services are
 

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.420
that you can see what services are
available and what process you have to

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:44.430
available and what process you have to
 

00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:46.670
available and what process you have to
go through then the last thing I want to

00:42:46.670 --> 00:42:46.680
go through then the last thing I want to
 

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.570
go through then the last thing I want to
say is these are early days we are still

00:42:49.570 --> 00:42:49.580
say is these are early days we are still
 

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:52.700
say is these are early days we are still
refining all aspects of the service so I

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:52.710
refining all aspects of the service so I
 

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:54.710
refining all aspects of the service so I
don't want to stand up here and pretend

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720
don't want to stand up here and pretend
 

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.050
don't want to stand up here and pretend
like it's done but i can tell you we're

reduction of computation earlier and the
 

00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:04.760
reduction of computation earlier and the
most important I think is that we

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:04.770
most important I think is that we
 

00:52:04.770 --> 00:52:07.190

increasingly getting a data submitted by
 

00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:48.640
increasingly getting a data submitted by
investigators and we do have built a

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:48.650
investigators and we do have built a
 

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:52.000

very useful for the investigator so

00:56:12.490 --> 00:56:12.500
very useful for the investigator so
 

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:15.010
very useful for the investigator so
using that because it's targeted at this

of intended repositories so these aren't

00:57:14.230 --> 00:57:14.240
of intended repositories so these aren't
 

00:57:14.240 --> 00:57:16.660
of intended repositories so these aren't
used just by people who want to submit

00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:16.670
used just by people who want to submit
 

00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:18.520
used just by people who want to submit
to us but people who want to submit

addition to this that we're working on

00:57:31.210 --> 00:57:31.220
addition to this that we're working on
 

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:33.880
addition to this that we're working on
is a tool that actually then allows

00:57:33.880 --> 00:57:33.890
is a tool that actually then allows
 

00:57:33.890 --> 00:57:34.690
is a tool that actually then allows
people to

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:34.700
people to
 

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.270
people to
show compliance with what they promised

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:37.280
show compliance with what they promised
 

00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:40.089
show compliance with what they promised
in their data management plans so when

00:57:40.089 --> 00:57:40.099
in their data management plans so when
 

00:57:40.099 --> 00:57:44.170
in their data management plans so when
they get their proposal funded and then

00:57:44.170 --> 00:57:44.180
they get their proposal funded and then
 

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.500
they get their proposal funded and then
submit data to our repository the

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:47.510
submit data to our repository the
 

00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:49.390
submit data to our repository the
information that they've provided in the

00:57:49.390 --> 00:57:49.400
information that they've provided in the
 

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.089
information that they've provided in the
data management plan will be linked to

00:57:52.089 --> 00:57:52.099
data management plan will be linked to
 

00:57:52.099 --> 00:57:54.790
data management plan will be linked to
the data sets that they have submitted

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:54.800
the data sets that they have submitted
 

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:57.579
the data sets that they have submitted
and they can easily get to our system

00:57:57.579 --> 00:57:57.589
and they can easily get to our system
 

00:57:57.589 --> 00:58:01.060
and they can easily get to our system
call up an award number and get a report

00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:01.070
call up an award number and get a report
 

00:58:01.070 --> 00:58:03.940
call up an award number and get a report
from our systems which data sets have

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:03.950
from our systems which data sets have
 

00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:07.480
from our systems which data sets have
been made available to our data facility

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:07.490
been made available to our data facility
 

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:10.270
been made available to our data facility
and that can go to NSF as part of an

00:58:10.270 --> 00:58:10.280
and that can go to NSF as part of an
 

00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.940
and that can go to NSF as part of an
annual report or as part of a final

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:12.950
annual report or as part of a final
 

00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:18.359
annual report or as part of a final
report so last but not least is the data

00:58:18.359 --> 00:58:18.369
report so last but not least is the data
 

00:58:18.369 --> 00:58:20.319
report so last but not least is the data
publication this is something really

00:58:20.319 --> 00:58:20.329
publication this is something really
 

00:58:20.329 --> 00:58:22.930
publication this is something really
close to my heart I think this will

00:58:22.930 --> 00:58:22.940
close to my heart I think this will
 

00:58:22.940 --> 00:58:27.310
close to my heart I think this will
drive a lot of the the willingness to

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:27.320
drive a lot of the the willingness to
 

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:32.560
drive a lot of the the willingness to
share data when in the past data of them

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:32.570
share data when in the past data of them
 

00:58:32.570 --> 00:58:36.960
share data when in the past data of them
not included in the publication and and

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:36.970
not included in the publication and and
 

00:58:36.970 --> 00:58:40.359
not included in the publication and and
people have not and when they then send

00:58:40.359 --> 00:58:40.369
people have not and when they then send
 

00:58:40.369 --> 00:58:43.150
people have not and when they then send
it to a colleague or shared it through a

00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160
it to a colleague or shared it through a
 

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.490
it to a colleague or shared it through a
repository they basically don't get

00:58:45.490 --> 00:58:45.500
repository they basically don't get
 

00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:48.880
repository they basically don't get
credit for it and making data actually a

00:58:48.880 --> 00:58:48.890
credit for it and making data actually a
 

00:58:48.890 --> 00:58:51.150
credit for it and making data actually a
sizable entity that can then be

00:58:51.150 --> 00:58:51.160
sizable entity that can then be
 

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.349
sizable entity that can then be
referenced in other people's

00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359
referenced in other people's
 

00:58:53.359 --> 00:58:55.990
referenced in other people's
publications in your own publications is

00:58:55.990 --> 00:58:56.000
publications in your own publications is
 

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.300
publications in your own publications is
a big advantage and there are many

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:58.310
a big advantage and there are many
 

00:58:58.310 --> 00:59:01.180
a big advantage and there are many
efforts going on to basically provide

00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:01.190
efforts going on to basically provide
 

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:04.180
efforts going on to basically provide
unique identification inside ability to

00:59:04.180 --> 00:59:04.190

data sets we're doing it through an

00:59:06.579 --> 00:59:06.589
data sets we're doing it through an
 

00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:08.319
data sets we're doing it through an
effort core data site it's an

00:59:08.319 --> 00:59:08.329
effort core data site it's an
 

00:59:08.329 --> 00:59:10.569
effort core data site it's an
international consortium that provides

00:59:10.569 --> 00:59:10.579
international consortium that provides
 

00:59:10.579 --> 00:59:16.780
international consortium that provides
services by basically cataloging

00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:16.790
services by basically cataloging
 

00:59:16.790 --> 00:59:19.059
services by basically cataloging
metadata for data sets and registering

00:59:19.059 --> 00:59:19.069
metadata for data sets and registering
 

00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:22.540
metadata for data sets and registering
these data sets within the DOI system so

00:59:22.540 --> 00:59:22.550
these data sets within the DOI system so
 

00:59:22.550 --> 00:59:25.569
these data sets within the DOI system so
a data set has a DOI and can be sided

00:59:25.569 --> 00:59:25.579
a data set has a DOI and can be sided
 

00:59:25.579 --> 00:59:28.530
a data set has a DOI and can be sided
inside a publication that also has a DUI

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:28.540
inside a publication that also has a DUI
 

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.349
inside a publication that also has a DUI
so and we were only starting this this

00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359
so and we were only starting this this
 

00:59:32.359 --> 00:59:34.150
so and we were only starting this this
is still in a beta version so I can't

00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160
is still in a beta version so I can't
 

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:37.150
is still in a beta version so I can't
give you any experiences on this but I

00:59:37.150 --> 00:59:37.160
give you any experiences on this but I
 

00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.440
give you any experiences on this but I
think it will really change and change a

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:41.450
think it will really change and change a
 

00:59:41.450 --> 00:59:45.099
think it will really change and change a
lot of the address a lot of the concerns

00:59:45.099 --> 00:59:45.109
lot of the address a lot of the concerns
 

00:59:45.109 --> 00:59:47.319
lot of the address a lot of the concerns
of the science community another

00:59:47.319 --> 00:59:47.329
of the science community another
 

00:59:47.329 --> 00:59:48.100
of the science community another
advantage

00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:48.110
advantage
 

00:59:48.110 --> 00:59:50.950
advantage
it actually has is that some publishers

00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960
it actually has is that some publishers
 

00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:53.980
it actually has is that some publishers
start to link to the data sets via these

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:53.990
start to link to the data sets via these
 

00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:56.290
start to link to the data sets via these
data set do is we have an agreement

00:59:56.290 --> 00:59:56.300
data set do is we have an agreement
 

00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:58.270
data set do is we have an agreement
already with elsevier they show

00:59:58.270 --> 00:59:58.280
already with elsevier they show
 

00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.060
already with elsevier they show
basically the links to the publications

01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:01.070
basically the links to the publications
 

01:00:01.070 --> 01:00:03.790
basically the links to the publications
and to the in the publication's the

01:00:03.790 --> 01:00:03.800
and to the in the publication's the
 

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:06.370
and to the in the publication's the
links to the data sets and it's

01:00:06.370 --> 01:00:06.380
links to the data sets and it's
 

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.770
links to the data sets and it's
interesting I just wanted to put this in

01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:08.780
interesting I just wanted to put this in
 

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:11.950
interesting I just wanted to put this in
what the impact can be data sharing can

01:00:11.950 --> 01:00:11.960
what the impact can be data sharing can
 

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:14.230
what the impact can be data sharing can
increase your citation index and that's

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:14.240
increase your citation index and that's
 

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.350
increase your citation index and that's
really I think it's something that

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:16.360
really I think it's something that
 

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:22.080
really I think it's something that
researchers are going to be looking for

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:22.090
 

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:27.220
that's my last slide I'm not going to

that's my last slide I'm not going to
 

01:00:27.230 --> 01:00:29.470
that's my last slide I'm not going to
get very deep into it what I wanted to

all of the talks were great just to add
another level of complexity and you were

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:39.650
another level of complexity and you were
 

01:02:39.650 --> 01:02:41.410
another level of complexity and you were

for rare diseases and they were laying

out a plan for archiving the data and a

out a plan for archiving the data and a
 

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.549
out a plan for archiving the data and a
repository and they ran into a huge

01:02:57.549 --> 01:02:57.559
repository and they ran into a huge
 

01:02:57.559 --> 01:02:59.589
repository and they ran into a huge
problem because one of the participants

01:02:59.589 --> 01:02:59.599
problem because one of the participants
 

01:02:59.599 --> 01:03:03.099

said well genomic data leaves the

individual completely identifiable and
therefore they argued that material that

seem to perhaps kill the data sharing
 

01:03:23.119 --> 01:03:24.910
seem to perhaps kill the data sharing
which is the whole point and then

01:03:24.910 --> 01:03:24.920
which is the whole point and then

and I furiously disputed this and said

01:03:38.739 --> 01:03:38.749
and I furiously disputed this and said
 

01:03:38.749 --> 01:03:41.469
and I furiously disputed this and said
it was an error but I'm wondering do you

01:03:41.469 --> 01:03:41.479
it was an error but I'm wondering do you
 

01:03:41.479 --> 01:03:43.089
it was an error but I'm wondering do you
have any observations about this issue

01:03:43.089 --> 01:03:43.099
have any observations about this issue
 

01:03:43.099 --> 01:03:44.259
have any observations about this issue
but it's something that the audience

01:03:44.259 --> 01:03:44.269
but it's something that the audience
 

01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:46.450
but it's something that the audience
should be aware of as something that

should be aware of as something that
 

01:03:46.460 --> 01:03:48.729
should be aware of as something that
will come up so you should take

01:03:48.729 --> 01:03:48.739
will come up so you should take
 

01:03:48.739 --> 01:03:52.019
will come up so you should take

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:02.590
access and I wonder to the commentators
 

01:04:02.590 --> 01:04:07.070
access and I wonder to the commentators
have any comments what's it take it I

01:04:07.070 --> 01:04:07.080
have any comments what's it take it I
 

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.960

can start there's a reason why we

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:12.970
can start there's a reason why we
 

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:17.790
can start there's a reason why we
started with astronomy data as

started with astronomy data as
 

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.580
started with astronomy data as
astronomers have told us 64 plus it has

no commercial value no privacy issues
and so on and I mean that's a facetious

01:04:26.220 --> 01:04:26.230
and so on and I mean that's a facetious
 

01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:28.620
and so on and I mean that's a facetious
comment but in all seriousness we did

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:28.630
comment but in all seriousness we did
 

01:04:28.630 --> 01:04:31.890
comment but in all seriousness we did
want to start with unencumbered data we

01:04:31.890 --> 01:04:31.900
want to start with unencumbered data we

want to start with unencumbered data we
another guiding principle I suppose we

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:33.790
another guiding principle I suppose we
 

01:04:33.790 --> 01:04:35.970
another guiding principle I suppose we
have is it's best to start with an open

01:04:35.970 --> 01:04:35.980
have is it's best to start with an open
 

01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:38.700
have is it's best to start with an open
system and tighten the bolts later when

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:38.710

anonymization of data so let me just put

01:04:47.970 --> 01:04:47.980
anonymization of data so let me just put
 

01:04:47.980 --> 01:04:50.250
anonymization of data so let me just put
that out there but my understanding is

01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:50.260
that out there but my understanding is
 

01:04:50.260 --> 01:04:51.660
that out there but my understanding is
that is the technique that's used

01:04:51.660 --> 01:04:51.670
that is the technique that's used
 

01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.840
that is the technique that's used
already in many disciplines in terms of

01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:54.850
already in many disciplines in terms of
 

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.849
already in many disciplines in terms of
trying to share the data so it's it's

01:04:56.849 --> 01:04:56.859
trying to share the data so it's it's
 

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:59.070
trying to share the data so it's it's
certainly well worth thinking about that

01:04:59.070 --> 01:04:59.080
certainly well worth thinking about that
 

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:02.520
certainly well worth thinking about that

data so the case that we came up with

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:19.630
data so the case that we came up with
 

01:05:19.630 --> 01:05:23.000
data so the case that we came up with
was apparently the North Slope of Alaska

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.010
was apparently the North Slope of Alaska

people built ice roads they basically

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:25.810
people built ice roads they basically
 

01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:27.480
people built ice roads they basically
just build channels out of lakes they

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:27.490
just build channels out of lakes they
 

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.950
just build channels out of lakes they
freeze and they become roads that you

01:05:28.950 --> 01:05:28.960
freeze and they become roads that you
 

01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:31.470
freeze and they become roads that you
can drive on and one of the big concerns

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:31.480
can drive on and one of the big concerns
 

01:05:31.480 --> 01:05:34.430
can drive on and one of the big concerns
is getting too close to a polar bear den

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440
is getting too close to a polar bear den
 

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.020
is getting too close to a polar bear den
because for obvious reasons some people

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.030
because for obvious reasons some people
 

01:05:37.030 --> 01:05:38.910
because for obvious reasons some people
don't do nice things to polar bears I

01:05:38.910 --> 01:05:38.920
don't do nice things to polar bears I
 

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:41.340
don't do nice things to polar bears I
suppose so there are people who have

01:05:41.340 --> 01:05:41.350
suppose so there are people who have
 

01:05:41.350 --> 01:05:44.550
suppose so there are people who have
data about where they think polar bears

01:05:44.550 --> 01:05:44.560
data about where they think polar bears
 

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.380
data about where they think polar bears
are located but they don't want to share

01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:46.390
are located but they don't want to share
 

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:49.410
are located but they don't want to share
that data in an open manner yet they

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:49.420
that data in an open manner yet they
 

01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.900
that data in an open manner yet they
also want to protect the polar bears so

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:51.910
also want to protect the polar bears so
 

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:53.820
also want to protect the polar bears so
the idea that we put forward we actually

proof-of-concept about this is to

01:05:57.870 --> 01:05:57.880
proof-of-concept about this is to
 

01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:00.270
proof-of-concept about this is to
basically build some sort of arbitrary

basically build some sort of arbitrary
 

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.099

region around where that polar bear

01:06:02.099 --> 01:06:02.109
region around where that polar bear
 

01:06:02.109 --> 01:06:04.680
region around where that polar bear
might be so when you're designing the

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:04.690
might be so when you're designing the
 

01:06:04.690 --> 01:06:07.500
might be so when you're designing the
ice road you just avoid that region but

01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:07.510
ice road you just avoid that region but
 

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:09.180
ice road you just avoid that region but
you don't get information about where

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:09.190
you don't get information about where

the polar bear is
larly and you can do the same thing with

larly and you can do the same thing with
 

01:06:12.349 --> 01:06:14.530
larly and you can do the same thing with
its food sources and things like that so

01:06:14.530 --> 01:06:14.540
its food sources and things like that so
 

01:06:14.540 --> 01:06:15.940
its food sources and things like that so
I think that's the kind of technique

01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:15.950
I think that's the kind of technique
 

01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:18.940
I think that's the kind of technique
will have to use as we move forward but

one of the challenges for open data but

that in in some cases we also need to

that in in some cases we also need to
think about levels of service so you may

01:08:56.669 --> 01:08:56.679
who told me that his data management
 

01:08:56.679 --> 01:08:58.709
who told me that his data management
plan is one line I do not generate any

01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719
plan is one line I do not generate any
 

01:08:58.719 --> 01:09:02.609
plan is one line I do not generate any
data so that may be the edge case but

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:02.619
data so that may be the edge case but
 

01:09:02.619 --> 01:09:04.740
data so that may be the edge case but
the reality is that in some cases your

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:04.750
the reality is that in some cases your
 

01:09:04.750 --> 01:09:06.629
the reality is that in some cases your
data management plan may explicitly

01:09:06.629 --> 01:09:06.639
data management plan may explicitly
 

01:09:06.639 --> 01:09:08.220
data management plan may explicitly
state you're not sharing the data and

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:08.230
state you're not sharing the data and
 

01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:09.930
state you're not sharing the data and
the example Victoria gave is very good

01:09:09.930 --> 01:09:09.940
the example Victoria gave is very good
 

01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:13.919
the example Victoria gave is very good
one so it's very much consistent with

01:09:13.919 --> 01:09:13.929
one so it's very much consistent with
 

01:09:13.929 --> 01:09:15.689
one so it's very much consistent with
the NSF view that this is not one size

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:15.699
the NSF view that this is not one size
 

01:09:15.699 --> 01:09:17.370
the NSF view that this is not one size
that's all but in cases where we can

01:09:17.370 --> 01:09:17.380
that's all but in cases where we can
 

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:19.349
that's all but in cases where we can
share the data especially when we

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:19.359
share the data especially when we
 

01:09:19.359 --> 01:09:20.609
share the data especially when we
typically have and I think that could be

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:20.619

terms of citing data I think one of the

01:09:39.349 --> 01:09:39.359
terms of citing data I think one of the
 

01:09:39.359 --> 01:09:42.599
terms of citing data I think one of the
barriers that we have is that those who

01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:42.609
barriers that we have is that those who
 

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:45.510

tracking the citation of the data and
 

01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:51.300
tracking the citation of the data and
the use of the data so there is a

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:51.310
the use of the data so there is a
 

01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:54.120
the use of the data so there is a
reaction and I think this will you know

01:13:04.220 --> 01:13:04.230
produced that data can search the
 

01:13:04.230 --> 01:13:06.740
produced that data can search the
literature for others who have used the

01:13:06.740 --> 01:13:06.750
literature for others who have used the
 

01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:09.020
literature for others who have used the
data look at their interpretation or use

01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:09.030
data look at their interpretation or use
 

01:13:09.030 --> 01:13:10.850

and be able to comment so it would

01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860
and be able to comment so it would
 

01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:13.370
and be able to comment so it would
generate some discussion about that so I

01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:13.380
generate some discussion about that so I
 

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:18.350
generate some discussion about that so I
think that's another added value I mean

01:13:18.350 --> 01:13:18.360
think that's another added value I mean
 

01:13:18.360 --> 01:13:20.990

again we did just just a brief comment

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000
again we did just just a brief comment
 

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:23.630
again we did just just a brief comment
back to that I think it's in that

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:23.640
back to that I think it's in that
 

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.290
back to that I think it's in that
respect also very important to have the

01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300
respect also very important to have the
 

01:13:27.300 --> 01:13:30.080
respect also very important to have the
data publication go through a certain

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.090

data publication go through a certain
process of review in that you want to

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:33.690
process of review in that you want to
 

01:13:33.690 --> 01:13:35.570
process of review in that you want to
make sure that there is appropriate

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:41.120
documentation of the data acquisition
process and so on that certain you know

impression is it's so new that I think

01:15:29.049 --> 01:15:29.059
impression is it's so new that I think
 

01:15:29.059 --> 01:15:30.609
impression is it's so new that I think
that the funding agencies are very open

actually doing this in the field it's
 

01:15:47.539 --> 01:15:49.089
actually doing this in the field it's
one thing to sit there and you know an

that so you know if there is a lot of

01:16:39.339 --> 01:16:39.349
that so you know if there is a lot of
 

01:16:39.349 --> 01:16:41.439
that so you know if there is a lot of
dissatisfaction for example in your

01:16:41.439 --> 01:16:41.449
dissatisfaction for example in your
 

01:16:41.449 --> 01:16:43.600

you could go to NIH and say well we

01:16:45.429 --> 01:16:45.439
you could go to NIH and say well we
 

01:16:45.439 --> 01:16:46.959
you could go to NIH and say well we
would like to build something better or

would like to build something better or
 

01:16:46.969 --> 01:16:49.089
would like to build something better or
something more sophisticated and then it

01:16:49.089 --> 01:16:49.099
something more sophisticated and then it
 

01:16:49.099 --> 01:16:51.220
something more sophisticated and then it
can actually happen I

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:51.230
can actually happen I
 

01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:54.510
can actually happen I
I chance me for an NIH whether that's I

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:54.520
I chance me for an NIH whether that's I

think that's something that you would

01:16:56.440 --> 01:16:56.450
think that's something that you would
 

01:16:56.450 --> 01:16:57.880
think that's something that you would
have you'd have to make a difficult

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:57.890
have you'd have to make a difficult
 

01:16:57.890 --> 01:16:59.800
have you'd have to make a difficult
argument to NSF for them to actually

01:16:59.800 --> 01:16:59.810
argument to NSF for them to actually
 

01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:01.270
argument to NSF for them to actually
fund something like that I think that

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:01.280
fund something like that I think that
 

01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.490
fund something like that I think that
would be tough and I have seen are

01:17:03.490 --> 01:17:03.500
would be tough and I have seen are
 

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:06.820
would be tough and I have seen are
people who have done a lot of so again I

01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:06.830
people who have done a lot of so again I
 

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:08.290
people who have done a lot of so again I
want to bring this back to software

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:08.300
want to bring this back to software
 

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.580
want to bring this back to software
because it's about software sharing as

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:09.590
because it's about software sharing as
 

01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.320
because it's about software sharing as
well and people who have done a lot of

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:11.330
well and people who have done a lot of
 

01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:12.729
well and people who have done a lot of
open source software and coding and

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:12.739
open source software and coding and
 

01:17:12.739 --> 01:17:14.290
open source software and coding and
sharing and they would like say NSF

01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:14.300
sharing and they would like say NSF
 

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.840

support for their software that's used
 

01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:18.640
support for their software that's used

in many applications and so on and it
 

01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:20.590
in many applications and so on and it
just goes nowhere so I mean the

01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600
just goes nowhere so I mean the
 

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.510
just goes nowhere so I mean the
arguments are still kind of tough in

01:17:22.510 --> 01:17:22.520
arguments are still kind of tough in
 

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.310
arguments are still kind of tough in

there I mean it's one thing if NSF is

there I mean it's one thing if NSF is

already so but but my impression is that

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:06.110
already so but but my impression is that
 

01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:07.660
already so but but my impression is that
is something that's percolating in

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:07.670
is something that's percolating in
 

01:18:07.670 --> 01:18:09.310
is something that's percolating in
people's minds so this could be

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320
people's minds so this could be
 

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.720
people's minds so this could be
something that we're moving towards and

01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:10.730
something that we're moving towards and
 

01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:12.580
something that we're moving towards and
it's certainly an open question at which

this something that a federal agency
would fund and sort of set up like you

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:23.150
would fund and sort of set up like you
 

01:18:23.150 --> 01:18:25.150
would fund and sort of set up like you
searched to the VN NSF cloud I mean

01:18:25.150 --> 01:18:25.160
searched to the VN NSF cloud I mean
 

01:18:25.160 --> 01:18:26.590
searched to the VN NSF cloud I mean
these are sort of open questions that

01:18:26.590 --> 01:18:26.600
these are sort of open questions that
 

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:30.700
these are sort of open questions that
people are grappling with and also again

it's the problems are so granular that

01:18:32.710 --> 01:18:32.720
it's the problems are so granular that
 

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:34.570
it's the problems are so granular that
it becomes a domain-specific question as

it becomes a domain-specific question as

well in that respect just to add this I

01:18:37.330 --> 01:18:37.340
well in that respect just to add this I
 

01:18:37.340 --> 01:18:38.979
well in that respect just to add this I
mean for the earth sciences there's

01:18:38.979 --> 01:18:38.989
mean for the earth sciences there's
 

01:18:38.989 --> 01:18:42.490

actually currently a planning effort

01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:42.500
actually currently a planning effort
 

01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.520

computation I mean not the
 

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.620

high-performance computation that

01:18:57.620 --> 01:18:57.630
high-performance computation that
 

01:18:57.630 --> 01:19:00.140
high-performance computation that
a real significant effort to actually

01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:00.150
a real significant effort to actually
 

01:19:00.150 --> 01:19:03.050
a real significant effort to actually
build an infrastructure yeah i can say

01:19:03.050 --> 01:19:03.060
build an infrastructure yeah i can say
 

01:19:03.060 --> 01:19:06.680
build an infrastructure yeah i can say
that from from my perspective that there

01:19:06.680 --> 01:19:06.690
that from from my perspective that there
 

01:19:06.690 --> 01:19:09.260
that from from my perspective that there
is a and NSF sometimes actually looks

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:09.270
is a and NSF sometimes actually looks
 

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:12.890
is a and NSF sometimes actually looks
for ideas that they can fund rather than

01:19:12.890 --> 01:19:12.900
for ideas that they can fund rather than
 

01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:16.430
for ideas that they can fund rather than
being you know hesitant to to put money

01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440
being you know hesitant to to put money
 

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.460
being you know hesitant to to put money
into that area i think that there is a

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:18.470
into that area i think that there is a
 

01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:21.500
into that area i think that there is a
yeah as has been said by by all of you

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:21.510
yeah as has been said by by all of you
 

01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:23.450

you know we are in a field of transition

01:19:23.450 --> 01:19:23.460
you know we are in a field of transition
 

01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.220
you know we are in a field of transition
but i personally made the experience

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:25.230
but i personally made the experience
 

01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:30.140
but i personally made the experience
that they are very open to ideas for how

01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:30.150
that they are very open to ideas for how
 

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:33.770
that they are very open to ideas for how
to get data out in a way and content and

01:19:33.770 --> 01:19:33.780
to get data out in a way and content and
 

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:35.690
to get data out in a way and content and
preserve them in a way that maximizes

01:19:35.690 --> 01:19:35.700
preserve them in a way that maximizes

the scientific output from the

the scientific output from the
investment bomb finally yeah well i mean

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:41.870
investment bomb finally yeah well i mean
 

01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:45.050
investment bomb finally yeah well i mean
unfortunately it's not a linear thing i

01:19:45.050 --> 01:19:45.060
unfortunately it's not a linear thing i
 

01:19:45.060 --> 01:19:47.210
unfortunately it's not a linear thing i
mean this is a side in response but in

changed it's mine and it's cut them way
 

01:19:55.530 --> 01:19:57.620
changed it's mine and it's cut them way
back and you know it's very hard to

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:57.630
back and you know it's very hard to
 

01:19:57.630 --> 01:19:59.810
back and you know it's very hard to
figure out and which I guess that's my

01:19:59.810 --> 01:19:59.820
figure out and which I guess that's my
 

01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:01.940
figure out and which I guess that's my
question which gets back to the NSF data

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:01.950
question which gets back to the NSF data
 

01:20:01.950 --> 01:20:05.180
question which gets back to the NSF data
management plans which is that you know

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:05.190
management plans which is that you know
 

01:20:05.190 --> 01:20:07.940
management plans which is that you know
NSF actually had a data plan requirement

01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:07.950
NSF actually had a data plan requirement
 

01:20:07.950 --> 01:20:10.160
NSF actually had a data plan requirement
from a long time and I remember being on

01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:10.170
from a long time and I remember being on
 

01:20:10.170 --> 01:20:12.890
from a long time and I remember being on
review panels where the reviewers the

01:20:12.890 --> 01:20:12.900
review panels where the reviewers the
 

01:20:12.900 --> 01:20:15.080
review panels where the reviewers the
panel and the program officers didn't

01:20:15.080 --> 01:20:15.090
panel and the program officers didn't
 

01:20:15.090 --> 01:20:17.080
panel and the program officers didn't
even notice when it wasn't there or

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:17.090
even notice when it wasn't there or
 

01:20:17.090 --> 01:20:19.340
even notice when it wasn't there or
didn't spend any time it made no

01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:19.350
didn't spend any time it made no
 

01:20:19.350 --> 01:20:22.100
didn't spend any time it made no
difference in decisions so I mean now

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:22.110
difference in decisions so I mean now
 

01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:26.060
difference in decisions so I mean now
that there's a one or two page plan the

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:26.070
that there's a one or two page plan the
 

01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:29.480
that there's a one or two page plan the
important thing is our reviewers coming

01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:29.490
important thing is our reviewers coming
 

01:20:29.490 --> 01:20:32.930
important thing is our reviewers coming
from the community are our panels as

01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940
from the community are our panels as
 

01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:35.330
from the community are our panels as
managed by program officers actually

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:35.340
managed by program officers actually
 

01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:39.980
managed by program officers actually
going to take the plan seriously and you

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:39.990
going to take the plan seriously and you
 

01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:42.680
going to take the plan seriously and you
know that includes when somebody budgets

01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:42.690
know that includes when somebody budgets
 

01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:45.980
know that includes when somebody budgets
X dollars for for data management that

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:45.990
X dollars for for data management that
 

01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:48.680
X dollars for for data management that
they take it seriously and don't cut it

01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:48.690
they take it seriously and don't cut it
 

01:20:48.690 --> 01:20:52.940
they take it seriously and don't cut it
when a budget has to be negotiated and

01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:52.950
when a budget has to be negotiated and
 

01:20:52.950 --> 01:20:56.060
when a budget has to be negotiated and
I'm also curious so the the difference

01:20:56.060 --> 01:20:56.070
I'm also curious so the the difference
 

01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:59.270
I'm also curious so the the difference
between access and archiving versus

01:20:59.270 --> 01:20:59.280
between access and archiving versus
 

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:02.180
between access and archiving versus
stewardship and curation whether you

01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:02.190
stewardship and curation whether you
 

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.180
stewardship and curation whether you
have any sense that

01:21:03.180 --> 01:21:03.190
have any sense that
 

01:21:03.190 --> 01:21:05.729
have any sense that
NSF is actually if somebody actually

01:21:05.729 --> 01:21:05.739
NSF is actually if somebody actually
 

01:21:05.739 --> 01:21:07.770
NSF is actually if somebody actually
talked about curation they want you know

01:21:07.770 --> 01:21:07.780
talked about curation they want you know
 

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.959
talked about curation they want you know
and wanting to spend time and money on

01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:09.969
and wanting to spend time and money on
 

01:21:09.969 --> 01:21:11.840
and wanting to spend time and money on
curation whether that would really be

01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:11.850
curation whether that would really be
 

01:21:11.850 --> 01:21:14.310
curation whether that would really be
credible as opposed to yeah I'm making

01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320
credible as opposed to yeah I'm making
 

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.800
credible as opposed to yeah I'm making
data available so I'm just curious what

01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:16.810
data available so I'm just curious what
 

01:21:16.810 --> 01:21:19.290
data available so I'm just curious what
your impressions are of whether NSF and

01:21:19.290 --> 01:21:19.300
your impressions are of whether NSF and
 

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:22.470
your impressions are of whether NSF and
maybe NIH is experienced in actually

01:21:22.470 --> 01:21:22.480
maybe NIH is experienced in actually
 

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:28.170
maybe NIH is experienced in actually
enforcing this policy I mean yeah so I

01:21:28.170 --> 01:21:28.180
enforcing this policy I mean yeah so I
 

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.060
enforcing this policy I mean yeah so I
think one thing that hasn't been clearly

01:21:30.060 --> 01:21:30.070
think one thing that hasn't been clearly
 

01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:31.709
think one thing that hasn't been clearly
stated but it's worth mentioning is that

01:21:31.709 --> 01:21:31.719
stated but it's worth mentioning is that
 

01:21:31.719 --> 01:21:33.660
stated but it's worth mentioning is that
each of the directorate's with an NSF

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:33.670
each of the directorate's with an NSF
 

01:21:33.670 --> 01:21:35.700
each of the directorate's with an NSF
has different policies and requirements

01:21:35.700 --> 01:21:35.710
has different policies and requirements
 

01:21:35.710 --> 01:21:38.640
has different policies and requirements
too so just to reinforce that point of

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:38.650
too so just to reinforce that point of
 

01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:41.660
too so just to reinforce that point of
that there really isn't an NSF view I

01:21:41.660 --> 01:21:41.670
that there really isn't an NSF view I
 

01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.070
that there really isn't an NSF view I
don't work for NSF either but just

01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080
don't work for NSF either but just
 

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.300
don't work for NSF either but just
looking at there looking at their

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:45.310
looking at there looking at their
 

01:21:45.310 --> 01:21:47.640
looking at there looking at their
website you can tell obviously different

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:47.650
website you can tell obviously different
 

01:21:47.650 --> 01:21:49.320
website you can tell obviously different
directors have different views of what

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:49.330
directors have different views of what
 

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:52.290
directors have different views of what
what's happening so with that in mind I

01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:52.300
what's happening so with that in mind I
 

01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:54.600
what's happening so with that in mind I
think that again one thing that hasn't

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:54.610
think that again one thing that hasn't
 

01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:56.490
think that again one thing that hasn't
been explicitly stated but I'll say it

01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:56.500
been explicitly stated but I'll say it
 

01:21:56.500 --> 01:22:00.330
been explicitly stated but I'll say it
is disciplinary or institutional or

01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:00.340
is disciplinary or institutional or
 

01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:03.120
is disciplinary or institutional or
other models are complimentary I don't

01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:03.130
other models are complimentary I don't
 

01:22:03.130 --> 01:22:04.800
other models are complimentary I don't
think they're mutually exclusive or

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:04.810
think they're mutually exclusive or
 

01:22:04.810 --> 01:22:07.709
think they're mutually exclusive or
competitive in some ways Kirsten's

01:22:07.709 --> 01:22:07.719
competitive in some ways Kirsten's
 

01:22:07.719 --> 01:22:09.660
competitive in some ways Kirsten's
talking about a community that has she

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:09.670
talking about a community that has she
 

01:22:09.670 --> 01:22:11.760
talking about a community that has she
mentioned years of experience and

01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:11.770
mentioned years of experience and
 

01:22:11.770 --> 01:22:14.120
mentioned years of experience and
capacity and knowledge in this area I

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:14.130
capacity and knowledge in this area I
 

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:16.380
capacity and knowledge in this area I
think it would be reasonable for that

01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:16.390
think it would be reasonable for that
 

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:18.090
think it would be reasonable for that
community come forth and say we'd like

01:22:18.090 --> 01:22:18.100
community come forth and say we'd like
 

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:19.860
community come forth and say we'd like
to do curation we'd actually like to

01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:19.870
to do curation we'd actually like to
 

01:22:19.870 --> 01:22:21.840
to do curation we'd actually like to
move up that stack to do more

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:21.850
move up that stack to do more
 

01:22:21.850 --> 01:22:23.880
move up that stack to do more
interesting and innovative and useful

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:23.890
interesting and innovative and useful
 

01:22:23.890 --> 01:22:25.170
interesting and innovative and useful
things and seems like that's already

01:22:25.170 --> 01:22:25.180
things and seems like that's already
 

01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.860
things and seems like that's already
started where is it some communities

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:27.870
started where is it some communities
 

01:22:27.870 --> 01:22:30.540
started where is it some communities
that they have no tradition of sharing

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:30.550
that they have no tradition of sharing
 

01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:32.520
that they have no tradition of sharing
data they have no existing resources it

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:32.530
data they have no existing resources it
 

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.620
data they have no existing resources it
would be really hard to say we're going

01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:34.630
would be really hard to say we're going
 

01:22:34.630 --> 01:22:36.920
would be really hard to say we're going
from zero to a hundred and three seconds

01:22:36.920 --> 01:22:36.930
from zero to a hundred and three seconds
 

01:22:36.930 --> 01:22:39.120
from zero to a hundred and three seconds
so I think it would have to be tailored

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.130
so I think it would have to be tailored
 

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:41.430
so I think it would have to be tailored
according to each of those communities

01:22:41.430 --> 01:22:41.440
according to each of those communities
 

01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:43.470
according to each of those communities
in terms of what existing capacity they

01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480
in terms of what existing capacity they
 

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.500
in terms of what existing capacity they
have and what science is driven I mean I

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:46.510
have and what science is driven I mean I
 

01:22:46.510 --> 01:22:48.060
have and what science is driven I mean I
think we don't want to lose sight of

01:22:48.060 --> 01:22:48.070
think we don't want to lose sight of
 

01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:50.130
think we don't want to lose sight of
that is that ultimately it's about

01:22:50.130 --> 01:22:50.140
that is that ultimately it's about
 

01:22:50.140 --> 01:22:52.260
that is that ultimately it's about
better science it's not just about

01:22:52.260 --> 01:22:52.270
better science it's not just about
 

01:22:52.270 --> 01:22:54.630
better science it's not just about
infrastructure so I don't know that

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:54.640
infrastructure so I don't know that
 

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:55.890
infrastructure so I don't know that
that's a specific answer to your

01:22:55.890 --> 01:22:55.900
that's a specific answer to your
 

01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:00.689
that's a specific answer to your
question let me bring in a question for

that that was posted online and that
 

01:23:04.330 --> 01:23:07.020
that that was posted online and that
thing was by Tiffany Shaw who asked

thing was by Tiffany Shaw who asked
 

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:10.290
thing was by Tiffany Shaw who asked
about archiving output from computer

01:23:10.290 --> 01:23:10.300
about archiving output from computer
 

01:23:10.300 --> 01:23:12.330
about archiving output from computer
simulations in her case I think its

01:23:12.330 --> 01:23:12.340
simulations in her case I think its
 

01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:14.190
simulations in her case I think its
atmospheric

01:23:14.190 --> 01:23:14.200

insert miss fabric models we in my era
 

01:23:17.290 --> 01:23:21.500
insert miss fabric models we in my era
we prod at our probably 10-15 years ago

01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:21.510
we prod at our probably 10-15 years ago
 

01:23:21.510 --> 01:23:23.940
we prod at our probably 10-15 years ago
because we found the state of producers

01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:23.950
because we found the state of producers
 

01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:25.980
because we found the state of producers
we actually often need for our

we actually often need for our
 

01:23:25.990 --> 01:23:28.740
we actually often need for our
interpretation to see what models are

01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:28.750
interpretation to see what models are

who had the simulation was willing to

have the same question but I don't think

01:23:47.370 --> 01:23:47.380
have the same question but I don't think
 

01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:51.500
have the same question but I don't think
we have made big progress so what is the

particular field of expertise about
archiving output from computer

01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:02.770
archiving output from computer
 

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:04.500
archiving output from computer
simulation it could be you know related

01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:04.510
simulation it could be you know related
 

01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:06.120
simulation it could be you know related
to science too but but there are

01:24:06.120 --> 01:24:06.130
to science too but but there are
 

01:24:06.130 --> 01:24:07.890
to science too but but there are
computer simulations everywhere now and

01:24:07.890 --> 01:24:07.900
computer simulations everywhere now and
 

01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:11.610
computer simulations everywhere now and
the resistance often comes from those

01:24:11.610 --> 01:24:11.620
the resistance often comes from those
 

01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:14.910
the resistance often comes from those
who do these assimilating or you know we

01:24:14.910 --> 01:24:14.920
who do these assimilating or you know we
 

01:24:14.920 --> 01:24:16.770
who do these assimilating or you know we
are doing so many of them we need too

01:24:16.770 --> 01:24:16.780
are doing so many of them we need too
 

01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:18.660
are doing so many of them we need too
much storage space i mean i think that

01:24:18.660 --> 01:24:18.670
much storage space i mean i think that
 

01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:21.330
much storage space i mean i think that
should be out of the way right now and

01:24:21.330 --> 01:24:21.340
should be out of the way right now and
 

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:24.930
should be out of the way right now and
it just seems to be some discomfort to

01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:24.940
it just seems to be some discomfort to
 

01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:28.470
it just seems to be some discomfort to
to make that available is there any way

01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480
to make that available is there any way
 

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.320
to make that available is there any way
to encourage that and standardize it so

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:31.330
to encourage that and standardize it so
 

01:24:31.330 --> 01:24:33.090
to encourage that and standardize it so
that we have a little bit more parity

01:24:33.090 --> 01:24:33.100
that we have a little bit more parity
 

01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.190
that we have a little bit more parity
between those who are simulating at

01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:35.200
between those who are simulating at
 

01:24:35.200 --> 01:24:37.650
between those who are simulating at
those who are observing i mean i know

01:24:37.650 --> 01:24:37.660
those who are observing i mean i know
 

01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.840
those who are observing i mean i know
that some communities have started to

01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:39.850
that some communities have started to
 

01:24:39.850 --> 01:24:44.960
that some communities have started to
you know archive and and put models into

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:44.970
you know archive and and put models into
 

01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:47.550
you know archive and and put models into
repositories I mean systems is when the

01:24:47.550 --> 01:24:47.560
repositories I mean systems is when the
 

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:51.090
repositories I mean systems is when the
earth surface modeling community they

01:24:51.090 --> 01:24:51.100
earth surface modeling community they
 

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.770
earth surface modeling community they
just contacted me actually about

01:24:52.770 --> 01:24:52.780
just contacted me actually about
 

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:56.220
just contacted me actually about
registering models with do is so there's

01:24:56.220 --> 01:24:56.230
registering models with do is so there's
 

01:24:56.230 --> 01:24:58.740
registering models with do is so there's
clearly you know a movement in doing

01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:58.750
clearly you know a movement in doing
 

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:01.230
clearly you know a movement in doing
that and it's probably dependent on what

01:25:01.230 --> 01:25:01.240
that and it's probably dependent on what
 

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.830
that and it's probably dependent on what
the community sees as as necessary and

01:25:04.830 --> 01:25:04.840
the community sees as as necessary and
 

01:25:04.840 --> 01:25:07.470
the community sees as as necessary and
larger effort something like systems

01:25:07.470 --> 01:25:07.480
larger effort something like systems
 

01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.570
larger effort something like systems
where you want to participate you want

01:25:09.570 --> 01:25:09.580
where you want to participate you want
 

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.520
where you want to participate you want
to take advantage of computing

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:11.530
to take advantage of computing
 

01:25:11.530 --> 01:25:13.560
to take advantage of computing
infrastructure and so on if those

01:25:13.560 --> 01:25:13.570
infrastructure and so on if those
 

01:25:13.570 --> 01:25:15.960

communities put up policies and say you

01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:15.970
communities put up policies and say you
 

01:25:15.970 --> 01:25:18.600

know if you're using our infrastructure

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:18.610
know if you're using our infrastructure
 

01:25:18.610 --> 01:25:20.259

you're gonna have to make those models

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.010
you're gonna have to make those models
 

01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:28.790
you're gonna have to make those models
available that will drive it forward I'm

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800
available that will drive it forward I'm
 

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:30.649
available that will drive it forward I'm
not sure about other communities but

01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659
not sure about other communities but
 

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:33.679
not sure about other communities but
that's an example that I know of so some

01:25:33.679 --> 01:25:33.689
that's an example that I know of so some
 

01:25:33.689 --> 01:25:36.859
that's an example that I know of so some
progress being made in I my sense is my

01:25:36.859 --> 01:25:36.869
progress being made in I my sense is my
 

01:25:36.869 --> 01:25:39.169
progress being made in I my sense is my
sense is that this is also highly

01:25:39.169 --> 01:25:39.179
sense is that this is also highly
 

01:25:39.179 --> 01:25:42.080

community-specific the simulations that

01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:42.090
community-specific the simulations that
 

01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:45.199
community-specific the simulations that
I did as a statistician it would be

01:25:45.199 --> 01:25:45.209
I did as a statistician it would be
 

01:25:45.209 --> 01:25:47.540
I did as a statistician it would be
enough to share the code right and then

01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:47.550
enough to share the code right and then
 

01:25:47.550 --> 01:25:48.949
enough to share the code right and then
if someone had the code they could get

01:25:48.949 --> 01:25:48.959
if someone had the code they could get
 

01:25:48.959 --> 01:25:50.750
if someone had the code they could get
the output you didn't have to both share

01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:50.760
the output you didn't have to both share
 

01:25:50.760 --> 01:25:53.929
the output you didn't have to both share
the code and the output I think that if

01:25:53.929 --> 01:25:53.939
the code and the output I think that if
 

01:25:53.939 --> 01:25:57.799
the code and the output I think that if
you have simulations that require you

01:25:57.799 --> 01:25:57.809
you have simulations that require you
 

01:25:57.809 --> 01:26:03.290
you have simulations that require you
know hpc to forget the output or they

01:26:03.290 --> 01:26:03.300
know hpc to forget the output or they
 

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.419
know hpc to forget the output or they
just take like two months to run or

01:26:05.419 --> 01:26:05.429
just take like two months to run or
 

01:26:05.429 --> 01:26:07.129
just take like two months to run or
something then maybe there's an inn or

01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139
something then maybe there's an inn or
 

01:26:07.139 --> 01:26:09.290
something then maybe there's an inn or
maybe there's an incentive to put the

01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300
maybe there's an incentive to put the
 

01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.850
maybe there's an incentive to put the
output out there as well so that people

01:26:10.850 --> 01:26:10.860
output out there as well so that people
 

01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:12.259
output out there as well so that people
can work from what would be your final

01:26:12.259 --> 01:26:12.269
can work from what would be your final
 

01:26:12.269 --> 01:26:13.609
can work from what would be your final
data set and perhaps that's what

01:26:13.609 --> 01:26:13.619
data set and perhaps that's what
 

01:26:13.619 --> 01:26:15.469
data set and perhaps that's what
produced your figures in your paper but

01:26:15.469 --> 01:26:15.479
produced your figures in your paper but
 

01:26:15.479 --> 01:26:17.209
produced your figures in your paper but
the way I think about reproducible

01:26:17.209 --> 01:26:17.219

research is being able to say well

01:26:20.390 --> 01:26:20.400
research is being able to say well
 

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.909
research is being able to say well
here's where I started with the data the

01:26:22.909 --> 01:26:22.919
here's where I started with the data the
 

01:26:22.919 --> 01:26:24.169
here's where I started with the data the
digital version of the data here's

01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179
digital version of the data here's
 

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:26.600
digital version of the data here's
everything digital I did to it so you do

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:26.610
everything digital I did to it so you do
 

01:26:26.610 --> 01:26:28.250
everything digital I did to it so you do
run into issues where you know there are

01:26:28.250 --> 01:26:28.260
run into issues where you know there are
 

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.770
run into issues where you know there are
long computation times and so on and so

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780
long computation times and so on and so
 

01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.979
long computation times and so on and so
maybe you know there's providing support

01:26:33.979 --> 01:26:33.989
maybe you know there's providing support
 

01:26:33.989 --> 01:26:35.659
maybe you know there's providing support
for data sets produced part of the way

01:26:35.659 --> 01:26:35.669
for data sets produced part of the way
 

01:26:35.669 --> 01:26:37.759
for data sets produced part of the way
through is a way to shortcut that that

01:26:37.759 --> 01:26:37.769
through is a way to shortcut that that
 

01:26:37.769 --> 01:26:38.989
through is a way to shortcut that that
process so that when you're trying to

sitting there waiting for things to run
 

01:26:44.429 --> 01:26:46.879
sitting there waiting for things to run
or you're not waiting for time on the

01:26:46.879 --> 01:26:46.889
or you're not waiting for time on the
 

01:26:46.889 --> 01:26:49.100
or you're not waiting for time on the
Terra grid or something like this but

01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:49.110
Terra grid or something like this but
 

01:26:49.110 --> 01:26:50.569
Terra grid or something like this but
but again but you know I want to argue

01:26:50.569 --> 01:26:50.579
but again but you know I want to argue
 

01:26:50.579 --> 01:26:52.429
but again but you know I want to argue
that those I mean maybe I'm wrong on

01:26:52.429 --> 01:26:52.439
that those I mean maybe I'm wrong on
 

01:26:52.439 --> 01:26:54.370
that those I mean maybe I'm wrong on
this but I would argue that those are

01:26:54.370 --> 01:26:54.380
this but I would argue that those are
 

01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:57.140
this but I would argue that those are
not the common cases where we have this

01:26:57.140 --> 01:26:57.150
not the common cases where we have this
 

01:26:57.150 --> 01:27:00.109
not the common cases where we have this
enormous amounts of data and simulation

01:27:00.109 --> 01:27:00.119
enormous amounts of data and simulation
 

01:27:00.119 --> 01:27:01.609
enormous amounts of data and simulation
I think there's tons of simulations that

01:27:01.609 --> 01:27:01.619
I think there's tons of simulations that
 

01:27:01.619 --> 01:27:03.350
I think there's tons of simulations that
go on we're sharing the script to

01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360
go on we're sharing the script to
 

01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:05.449
go on we're sharing the script to
produce the simulation itself is enough

01:27:05.449 --> 01:27:05.459
produce the simulation itself is enough
 

01:27:05.459 --> 01:27:06.919
produce the simulation itself is enough
for people to see what you did and

01:27:06.919 --> 01:27:06.929
for people to see what you did and
 

01:27:06.929 --> 01:27:10.489
for people to see what you did and
replicate your results yeah I think one

01:27:10.489 --> 01:27:10.499
replicate your results yeah I think one
 

01:27:10.499 --> 01:27:12.259
replicate your results yeah I think one
again I don't think we've used this word

01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:12.269
again I don't think we've used this word
 

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:14.299
again I don't think we've used this word
yet but I think provenance is a really

01:27:14.299 --> 01:27:14.309
yet but I think provenance is a really
 

01:27:14.309 --> 01:27:16.310
yet but I think provenance is a really
important concept in all of this and one

01:27:16.310 --> 01:27:16.320
important concept in all of this and one
 

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:18.469
important concept in all of this and one
working definition we have very much

01:27:18.469 --> 01:27:18.479
working definition we have very much
 

01:27:18.479 --> 01:27:20.270
working definition we have very much
resonates with what you just said it's

01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280
resonates with what you just said it's
 

01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:23.060
resonates with what you just said it's

this data and what did they do with it

01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:24.570
this data and what did they do with it
 

01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:27.469
this data and what did they do with it
and from a preservation perspective

01:27:27.469 --> 01:27:27.479
and from a preservation perspective
 

01:27:27.479 --> 01:27:29.540
and from a preservation perspective
you'd love to get all of that and track

01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:29.550
you'd love to get all of that and track
 

01:27:29.550 --> 01:27:30.370
you'd love to get all of that and track
that over time

01:27:30.370 --> 01:27:30.380
that over time
 

01:27:30.380 --> 01:27:32.050
that over time
but from a pragmatic perspective or

01:27:32.050 --> 01:27:32.060
but from a pragmatic perspective or
 

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:33.879
but from a pragmatic perspective or
maybe even a scientific perspective that

01:27:33.879 --> 01:27:33.889
maybe even a scientific perspective that
 

01:27:33.889 --> 01:27:35.890
maybe even a scientific perspective that

of how data sharing happens in the

of how data sharing happens in the

project I I think I think there's an

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:27.260
project I I think I think there's an
 

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:30.790

underlying argument here though that in

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:30.800
underlying argument here though that in
 

01:29:30.800 --> 01:29:32.649

a paper that was co-written with my

advisor and a few other people we tried
 

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:36.939
advisor and a few other people we tried
to make the argument that really the

01:29:36.939 --> 01:29:36.949
to make the argument that really the
 

01:29:36.949 --> 01:29:39.010
to make the argument that really the
person who is benefiting from data and

01:29:39.010 --> 01:29:39.020
person who is benefiting from data and
 

01:29:39.020 --> 01:29:40.959
person who is benefiting from data and
code sharing is the researcher right

01:29:40.959 --> 01:29:40.969
code sharing is the researcher right
 

01:29:40.969 --> 01:29:43.490
code sharing is the researcher right
from the beginning that they will do

01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500
from the beginning that they will do
 

01:29:43.500 --> 01:29:45.110
from the beginning that they will do
our science and sharing the code in the

01:29:45.110 --> 01:29:45.120
our science and sharing the code in the
 

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:47.420
our science and sharing the code in the
data so it's not I think the argument if

01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:47.430
data so it's not I think the argument if
 

01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:48.860

you make it to other scientists that

01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:48.870
you make it to other scientists that
 

01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:50.660
you make it to other scientists that
this is good for science it's a very

01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:50.670
this is good for science it's a very
 

01:29:50.670 --> 01:29:52.820
this is good for science it's a very
difficult argument to hear when you have

01:29:52.820 --> 01:29:52.830
difficult argument to hear when you have
 

01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:54.950
difficult argument to hear when you have
deadlines on you and people knocking on

01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960
deadlines on you and people knocking on
 

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.360
deadlines on you and people knocking on
your door and you have to do this and so

01:29:56.360 --> 01:29:56.370
your door and you have to do this and so
 

01:29:56.370 --> 01:29:58.280
your door and you have to do this and so
on but if the argument is really

01:29:58.280 --> 01:29:58.290
on but if the argument is really
 

01:29:58.290 --> 01:30:00.590

personal and I did some survey research

01:30:00.590 --> 01:30:00.600
personal and I did some survey research
 

01:30:00.600 --> 01:30:02.000
personal and I did some survey research
about this too it seems to be more

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:02.010
about this too it seems to be more
 

01:30:02.010 --> 01:30:04.250
about this too it seems to be more
resonant so the idea of doing better

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:04.260
resonant so the idea of doing better
 

01:30:04.260 --> 01:30:05.810
resonant so the idea of doing better
science and des was mentioned earlier

being able to actually access your

being able to actually access your

previous results and so on and
 

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:10.820
previous results and so on and
communicate and your students are able

01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:10.830
communicate and your students are able
 

01:30:10.830 --> 01:30:12.980
communicate and your students are able
to come in and work on previous students

01:30:12.980 --> 01:30:12.990
to come in and work on previous students
 

01:30:12.990 --> 01:30:14.120
to come in and work on previous students
work because they've done work that's

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:14.130
work because they've done work that's
 

01:30:14.130 --> 01:30:17.090
work because they've done work that's
reproducible and open and then as Carson

01:30:17.090 --> 01:30:17.100
reproducible and open and then as Carson
 

01:30:17.100 --> 01:30:18.620
reproducible and open and then as Carson
mentioned and there's there's some other

01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:18.630
mentioned and there's there's some other
 

01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:21.230
mentioned and there's there's some other
bits of evidence to that you are excited

01:30:21.230 --> 01:30:21.240
bits of evidence to that you are excited
 

01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:23.210
bits of evidence to that you are excited
more and so these benefits kind of come

01:30:23.210 --> 01:30:23.220
more and so these benefits kind of come
 

01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:25.280
more and so these benefits kind of come
back to you and so I think that there

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:25.290
back to you and so I think that there
 

01:30:25.290 --> 01:30:30.650
back to you and so I think that there
are definite perceived disadvantages to

01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:30.660
are definite perceived disadvantages to
 

01:30:30.660 --> 01:30:33.520
are definite perceived disadvantages to
taking the time about data curation or

01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:33.530
taking the time about data curation or
 

01:30:33.530 --> 01:30:35.540
taking the time about data curation or
you know making your code available

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:35.550
you know making your code available

think in the long run those will

01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:40.830
think in the long run those will
 

01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:42.590

back to a point that you mentioned
earlier about the promotion and the

earlier about the promotion and the

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:08.010
disadvantage versus others who have
 

01:31:08.010 --> 01:31:09.860
disadvantage versus others who have
taken proactive steps to ensure

01:31:09.860 --> 01:31:09.870
taken proactive steps to ensure
 

01:31:09.870 --> 01:31:11.870
taken proactive steps to ensure
transparency in their work and taken

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880
transparency in their work and taken
 

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.280
transparency in their work and taken
care over their scientific communication

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:13.290
care over their scientific communication
 

01:31:13.290 --> 01:31:15.680
care over their scientific communication
so I think this is something that we are

01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:15.690
so I think this is something that we are
 

01:31:15.690 --> 01:31:17.330
so I think this is something that we are
starting to see changes that I've been

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340
starting to see changes that I've been
 

01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:20.180
starting to see changes that I've been
exposed to so but you know every field

01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:20.190
exposed to so but you know every field
 

01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:21.530
exposed to so but you know every field
is moving at its own pace and doing it

01:31:21.530 --> 01:31:21.540
is moving at its own pace and doing it
 

01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.740
is moving at its own pace and doing it
something definitely true and there are

01:31:24.740 --> 01:31:24.750
something definitely true and there are
 

01:31:24.750 --> 01:31:27.530
something definitely true and there are
also different shades of being

01:31:27.530 --> 01:31:27.540
also different shades of being
 

01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:29.360
also different shades of being
transparent of how you grade your

01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:29.370
transparent of how you grade your
 

01:31:29.370 --> 01:31:32.300
transparent of how you grade your
results versus having data out in a

01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:32.310
results versus having data out in a
 

01:31:32.310 --> 01:31:34.340
results versus having data out in a
transparent way but not having the time

01:31:34.340 --> 01:31:34.350
transparent way but not having the time
 

01:31:34.350 --> 01:31:38.090
transparent way but not having the time
over that to create synthetic results so

01:31:38.090 --> 01:31:38.100
over that to create synthetic results so
 

01:31:38.100 --> 01:31:39.800
over that to create synthetic results so
I think that that this is something that

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:39.810
I think that that this is something that
 

01:31:39.810 --> 01:31:43.970
I think that that this is something that
we have to keep keep some some attention

01:31:43.970 --> 01:31:43.980
we have to keep keep some some attention
 

01:31:43.980 --> 01:31:47.090
we have to keep keep some some attention
on as we are moving forward EST yeah I

01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100
on as we are moving forward EST yeah I
 

01:31:47.100 --> 01:31:50.180

was just adding to that aspect of

01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:50.190
was just adding to that aspect of
 

01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:53.000
was just adding to that aspect of
international data sharing i think you

01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:53.010
international data sharing i think you
 

01:31:53.010 --> 01:31:54.800
international data sharing i think you
know there are clearly and Bob could

01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:54.810
know there are clearly and Bob could
 

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:57.200
know there are clearly and Bob could
comment probably quite a bit on that

01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:57.210
comment probably quite a bit on that
 

01:31:57.210 --> 01:32:01.459
comment probably quite a bit on that
from the core data it's a perspective

01:32:01.459 --> 01:32:01.469
from the core data it's a perspective
 

01:32:01.469 --> 01:32:05.690
from the core data it's a perspective
that there are efforts underway to kind

01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:05.700
that there are efforts underway to kind
 

01:32:05.700 --> 01:32:07.040
that there are efforts underway to kind
of make sure that there is more

01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:07.050
of make sure that there is more
 

01:32:07.050 --> 01:32:09.979
of make sure that there is more
consistency and common understanding and

01:32:09.979 --> 01:32:09.989
consistency and common understanding and
 

01:32:09.989 --> 01:32:13.959
consistency and common understanding and
I've seen in the last year actually a

01:32:13.959 --> 01:32:13.969
I've seen in the last year actually a
 

01:32:13.969 --> 01:32:19.760
I've seen in the last year actually a
proactive engagement internationally the

01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:19.770
proactive engagement internationally the
 

01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:22.010
proactive engagement internationally the

sharing and so on so I think in many

01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:30.090
sharing and so on so I think in many
 

01:32:30.090 --> 01:32:32.060
sharing and so on so I think in many
countries and partly triggered by this

01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:32.070
countries and partly triggered by this
 

01:32:32.070 --> 01:32:36.380
countries and partly triggered by this
OECD report and so on all nations are

01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:36.390
OECD report and so on all nations are
 

01:32:36.390 --> 01:32:38.690
OECD report and so on all nations are
you know moving moving in this direction

01:32:38.690 --> 01:32:38.700
you know moving moving in this direction
 

01:32:38.700 --> 01:32:41.600
you know moving moving in this direction
of establishing infrastructures and

01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:41.610
of establishing infrastructures and
 

01:32:41.610 --> 01:32:46.130

seeing the the necessity to open an
 

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:48.470
seeing the the necessity to open an
international dialogue and it's it's

01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480
international dialogue and it's it's
 

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.170
international dialogue and it's it's
gonna come it's another piece of that

01:32:51.170 --> 01:32:51.180
gonna come it's another piece of that
 

01:32:51.180 --> 01:32:53.360
gonna come it's another piece of that
transition period that needs to be

01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:53.370
transition period that needs to be
 

01:32:53.370 --> 01:32:57.020
transition period that needs to be
resolved any other questions from the

01:32:57.020 --> 01:32:57.030
resolved any other questions from the
 

01:32:57.030 --> 01:32:59.810
resolved any other questions from the
audience doesn't seem to be the case so

01:32:59.810 --> 01:32:59.820
audience doesn't seem to be the case so
 

01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.970
audience doesn't seem to be the case so
I would like to thank again I was reap
