the thing I remember the most is one

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440
the thing I remember the most is one
 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.390
the thing I remember the most is one
doing we did several experiments with

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400
doing we did several experiments with
 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.070
doing we did several experiments with
cell lines with blood cells taken from

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
cell lines with blood cells taken from
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.320
cell lines with blood cells taken from
ex vivo we call it you take the blood

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330
ex vivo we call it you take the blood
 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.050
ex vivo we call it you take the blood
cells out and you culture them in a dish

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060
cells out and you culture them in a dish
 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.359
cells out and you culture them in a dish
and you work with them we had done four

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369
and you work with them we had done four
 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790
and you work with them we had done four
different experiments in vitro to in

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800
different experiments in vitro to in
 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.150
different experiments in vitro to in
vivo to in vitro and I'd analyzed that

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
vivo to in vitro and I'd analyzed that
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.220
vivo to in vitro and I'd analyzed that
data and I looked in the literature and

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
data and I looked in the literature and
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.430
data and I looked in the literature and
looked at genes that change and when

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440
looked at genes that change and when
 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.530
looked at genes that change and when
people are rejecting organs and I've

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540
people are rejecting organs and I've
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.389
people are rejecting organs and I've
been looking at all these tests

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399
been looking at all these tests
 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.420
been looking at all these tests
molecules that we had and there was this

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430
molecules that we had and there was this
 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250
molecules that we had and there was this
convergence that there were a couple of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260
convergence that there were a couple of
 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.750
convergence that there were a couple of
genes that we saw in all of our models

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760
genes that we saw in all of our models
 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.459
genes that we saw in all of our models
that changed and when I looked in the

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469
that changed and when I looked in the
 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.560
that changed and when I looked in the
literature they were changing in the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570
literature they were changing in the
 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.209
literature they were changing in the
opposite direction so when you were

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219
opposite direction so when you were
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.729
opposite direction so when you were
transplant in the transplant scenario

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739
transplant in the transplant scenario
 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.189
transplant in the transplant scenario
their expression level was going up and

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199
their expression level was going up and
 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.240
their expression level was going up and
in our models without our test drugs the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
in our models without our test drugs the
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.940
in our models without our test drugs the
expression level was going down that was

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950
expression level was going down that was
 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.710
expression level was going down that was
a very exciting moment because I thought

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720
a very exciting moment because I thought
 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.679
a very exciting moment because I thought
this is really cool I think I have

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689
this is really cool I think I have
 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.510
this is really cool I think I have
something I got on the phone and I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520
something I got on the phone and I
 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820
something I got on the phone and I
called call my colleague over in the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830
called call my colleague over in the
 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.830
called call my colleague over in the
therapeutic area I think I have

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840
therapeutic area I think I have
 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.690
therapeutic area I think I have
something I've got something this looks

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700
something I've got something this looks
 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.969
something I've got something this looks
very promising this looks really good we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979
very promising this looks really good we
 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.060
very promising this looks really good we
gotta test it and I think that was a

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070
gotta test it and I think that was a
 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.580
gotta test it and I think that was a
very exciting moment

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590
 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.649
