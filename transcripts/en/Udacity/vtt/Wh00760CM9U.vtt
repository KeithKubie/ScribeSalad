00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.670
Let's check out the final advice Moore
had for us on value propositions.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.988
Now, you'll notice he uses
the term positioning statement.

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:07.420
And that's totally okay.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.560
Many people use the term
positioning statement and

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.100
value proposition interchangeably.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.480
&gt;&gt; So, you hear a lot about
positioning in marketing.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.620
And I think your first
instinct is to think about,

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.680
that's something I'm supposed to do.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.150
But the first way you want to think
about positioning is actually

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.830
where you fit in your customer's head.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.976
So, in other words, the world,
or your customer base,

00:00:28.976 --> 00:00:32.658
only has a certain number of little
compartments to put things in.

00:00:32.658 --> 00:00:36.420
And so the first question is, what
compartment are they putting you in?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.980
And so remember in that positioning
statement we were talking about where we

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.420
said, our product or service is a blank.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.813
So the first positioning is to
make sure you're in the right box.

00:00:45.813 --> 00:00:48.113
You're put in the right
aisle in the supermarket.

00:00:48.113 --> 00:00:49.835
And that seems obvious,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:53.690
but sometimes there are multiple
boxes you could be in.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.846
So it's important to think about,
where do I want to compete and

00:00:56.846 --> 00:00:58.698
in what category do I want to compete?

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:02.630
So the first thing is then just get
yourself into the right category.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.190
Then the second thing is,

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.570
the way customers actually understand
you, is relative to your competitors.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.890
In other words, that's how they
understand the category, and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.690
that's how they're going to
understand you and

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.570
how you're different than the rest
of the people in the category.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.830
So it's important that you assemble
a set of legitimate competitors

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.360
that you have respect for.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.070
You don't want to be the best
house in a bad neighborhood.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.730
You actually want to
be the best house or

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:29.540
the right house in a good neighborhood.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.666
So, you want to pick worthy competitors
that, for some situations, you would

00:01:34.666 --> 00:01:39.648
acknowledge, they're actually better
at solving that problem than I am.

00:01:39.648 --> 00:01:40.483
But together,

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.820
we're all in the business of providing
this general type of service.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.940
And then the last piece of positioning.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.258
So after we've done
the generic category.

00:01:49.258 --> 00:01:52.430
After you've established what
we call the competitive set,

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.038
then the last piece of positioning
is okay now, why are we different?

00:01:56.038 --> 00:01:56.959
How are we different?

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.732
And why does that matter specifically to
the value proposition that the customer

00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:04.130
will be bringing to this purchase?

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:07.670
So you're helping the customer saying,
the question you want to answer is,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.420
you would want to call us when?

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.230
And the opposite of that answer is,
on the other hand,

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.400
if it were more of this situation, you
probably should call one of the others.
