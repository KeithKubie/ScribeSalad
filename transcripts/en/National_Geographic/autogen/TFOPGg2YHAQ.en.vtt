river in Cambodia and these fish move

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
river in Cambodia and these fish move
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.920
river in Cambodia and these fish move
out of the tonlé sap lake every year and

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930
out of the tonlé sap lake every year and
 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.729
out of the tonlé sap lake every year and
into the Mekong River we believe to to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739
into the Mekong River we believe to to
 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.470
into the Mekong River we believe to to
complete their spawning migration to

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480
complete their spawning migration to
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720
complete their spawning migration to
complete their lifecycle the head on

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730
complete their lifecycle the head on
 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.420
complete their lifecycle the head on
this thing is the same size as my head

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430
this thing is the same size as my head
 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.299
this thing is the same size as my head
and this almost rivals the size of some

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309
and this almost rivals the size of some
 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220

of the smaller Mekong giant catfish that
I've seen these fish have a very

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500
I've seen these fish have a very
 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.700
I've seen these fish have a very
delicate skin no scales and they have a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710
delicate skin no scales and they have a
 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619
delicate skin no scales and they have a
slime layer that protects them from

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
slime layer that protects them from
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.560
slime layer that protects them from
infection we're tagging and releasing

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
infection we're tagging and releasing
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.329
infection we're tagging and releasing
these fish to learn about their behavior

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339
these fish to learn about their behavior
 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.160
these fish to learn about their behavior
so this fat fish has an individual

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
so this fat fish has an individual
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.020
so this fat fish has an individual
numbered tag it's fish 3385 so this is

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
numbered tag it's fish 3385 so this is
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.990
numbered tag it's fish 3385 so this is
the 3,000 fish that we've tagged in the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000
the 3,000 fish that we've tagged in the
 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.330
the 3,000 fish that we've tagged in the
last four years and what we're doing is

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
last four years and what we're doing is
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.640
last four years and what we're doing is
we release these fish back into the

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650
we release these fish back into the
 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.289
we release these fish back into the
Tonle Sap River so they can continue

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299
Tonle Sap River so they can continue
 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.539
Tonle Sap River so they can continue
their migration and then if a fisherman

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549
their migration and then if a fisherman
 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.420
their migration and then if a fisherman
somewhere downstream catches this fish

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
somewhere downstream catches this fish
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060
somewhere downstream catches this fish
again we learn where where it's moved by

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070
again we learn where where it's moved by
 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:40.220
again we learn where where it's moved by
this individual identification number

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230
 
 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:51.210
 
why hold so now we've uh now we're in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220
why hold so now we've uh now we're in
 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.280
why hold so now we've uh now we're in
the middle of the river we want to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290
the middle of the river we want to
 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.950
the middle of the river we want to
release this fish away from the bank so

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960
release this fish away from the bank so
 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.800
release this fish away from the bank so
that it doesn't get caught again and

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810
that it doesn't get caught again and
 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.480
that it doesn't get caught again and
also want to make sure it can swim on

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490
also want to make sure it can swim on
 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.760
also want to make sure it can swim on
its own I'm gonna hop in seems to be

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770
its own I'm gonna hop in seems to be
 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.320
its own I'm gonna hop in seems to be
swimming pretty well really nice big

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330
swimming pretty well really nice big
 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.460
swimming pretty well really nice big
fish just needs a few seconds to get

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470
fish just needs a few seconds to get
 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:35.190
fish just needs a few seconds to get
acclimated to the river water again so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200
acclimated to the river water again so
 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.190
acclimated to the river water again so
we release the fish and it disappeared

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200
we release the fish and it disappeared
 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.500
we release the fish and it disappeared
and just saw it jump once and then go

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
and just saw it jump once and then go
 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.350
and just saw it jump once and then go
back down so it's all we can do a little

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360
back down so it's all we can do a little
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.660
back down so it's all we can do a little
naked
