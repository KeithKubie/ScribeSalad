00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.770
Vsauce!

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:03.400
Kevin here.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.660
Down here!

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.529
Wow you’re tall.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.590
That's because you’re actually a Tyrannosaurus
Rex.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.320
Seriously, look down at your funny T-Rex arms.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.110
They're not that funny.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.230
They’re more than three times stronger than
human arms so they're actually an upgrade!

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.300
Your genus name, Tyrannosaurus, comes from
the Ancient Greek tyrannos meaning tyrant

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.420
and sauros meaning lizard.

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.900
Rex is the Latin word for “King.”

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.120
So you’re literally the Tyrant Lizard King.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.390
Which is really cool.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.030
Wow, you’re tall.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.120
What’re you?

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.620
12 feet at the hip?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.430
Ah, that's better now we can see eye to eye.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.020
Here’s your view of a modern residential
area.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.420
You’re taller than a school bus.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.640
You could dunk your face through a basketball
hoop.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.860
You’re pretty much a one story house that
eats meat.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.780
Maybe I shouldn’t be this close to your
four foot jaws full of serrated teeth.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.990
With a bite force three and a half times stronger
than anything living on planet Earth today….

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.200
Look over there it's a delicious Triceratops!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.529
Oh, too bad you must've just missed it.

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:31.530
I swear it was there a second ago.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.860
Oh well.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.229
Woah, look what you did to the ground!

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.469
Your footprints are huge!

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:40.490
This is like three feet!

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.990
Y'know, if you stood on me with all 7 tons
of your body weight it’d be like piling

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.799
three and half cars on my chest.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.599
Speaking of cars...did you hear that?

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:59.990
Look over there!

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.329
That is how fast you run.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.700
Many scientists believe you run around 25
MPH.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.670
The fastest human runner in the world, Usain
Bolt, tops out at 27.44 MPH.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:21.400
So hunting humans, had we been around 66 million
years ago would’ve been right in your wheelhouse.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.530
Don’t hunt me though because I made a video.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.610
It's about you hunting.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.480
Here, let's watch it together.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.500
When it comes to finding food you’re likely
an active predator and scavenger.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.941
Healed bite marks on the tail of an Edmontosaurus
suggest you’d attack living prey and your

00:02:39.941 --> 00:02:45.290
incredibly large olfactory bulbs and nerves
suggest sniffing out dead prey from great

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.290
distances.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.380
A study in 2010 revealed you may have even
engaged in eating other T-Rexes so…cannibalism

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.380
too.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:59.070
So in conclusion you are hungry.

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.200
Very hungry.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.480
Very…very...very hungry.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.260
And I am very food-like.

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:20.360
But if I stand very still you can’t see
me!

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.100
You can still see me - can’t you?

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.660
That's because the whole vision motion thing
is a myth.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.110
Uhh.. before you eat me let me just say this
one thing...

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.370
AND AS ALWAYS - THANKS FOR WATCHING!
