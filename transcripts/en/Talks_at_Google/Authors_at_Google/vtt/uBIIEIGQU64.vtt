RACHEL O'MEARA: Hi, everybody.

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.260
Thanks for coming today.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.660
I'm Rachel O'Meara, and I'm
here to introduce Mark McClusky

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.190
today.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.400
We're very excited to host Mark
here at Google Mountain View.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.590
Mark is the CEO of
wired.com, which a lot of you

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.960
are probably familiar
with, and also has

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.890
his first book out,
"Faster, Higher, Stronger."

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.000
So we're going to be
hearing Mark talk about all

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.830
of the prowess of athletes and
how technology and data help

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.880
people strive to
be better athletes.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.860
Please welcome Mark.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.370
Thank you.

00:00:34.982 --> 00:00:36.440
MARK MCCLUSKY:
Thank you very much.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.523
Thanks for having me here.

00:00:37.523 --> 00:00:39.600
This is exciting to
get to come to talk

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.700
to you all about this book that
I've spent so long working on.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.030
The first question
almost everyone

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.190
asks me is like, why
did you write this book?

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.426
It's very interesting
that people always

00:00:52.426 --> 00:00:54.050
want to understand
the reasons that you

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.520
come to a subject matter.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.099
This is me at 17 looking really,
really gaunt as a cyclist.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:06.308
That's Franklin Shop 'n Save.

00:01:06.308 --> 00:01:07.557
That's Franklin, Pennsylvania.

00:01:07.557 --> 00:01:09.450
That was the local
grocery store chain.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.150
And I talked them into
sponsoring a cycling team.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.470
They sort of really
didn't understand

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.580
what I meant by a cycling team.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.886
But the investment was minimal,
and they were talked into it.

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:23.260
That's my best
friend growing up,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.320
Mike Dittman, in
front of me there.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.870
I talked him into racing bikes.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.370
He had been a swimmer, But I'd
just started a cycling team.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.520
I needed a team.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.090
And so it seemed sensible that
there be more than one of me

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.840
on the team.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.950
This is sort of the
first American bike boom.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.980
Greg LeMond had just won
the Tour de France in 1986.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.710
the John Tesh coverage on CBS
with, like, the weird synth

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.930
music that they'd play.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:52.890
And I loved it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.920
I thought it was the
most amazing sport ever.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.750
It really became a
huge part of my life.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.155
And, you know, like most
young athletes, I had dreams.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:03.520
I had dreams, someday I'll
ride in the Olympic Games.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.860
Someday, I'll ride in
the Tour de France.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:05.360
Right?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.340
So you get all the
gear and the kit.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.500
You grow the mullet,
because that was cool then.

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:14.060
Somebody should
have talked to me

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.375
about a lot of hair decisions.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.260
This is outside a race
in Lordstown, Ohio.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.980
And I finished second that day.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.100
I still remember the
sprint I lost that race.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.710
So I was good.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.030
I wasn't great.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.800
And I was a pretty big
fish in a very small pond,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.580
American cycling.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.940
Especially American cycling
in rural western Pennsylvania

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.460
in 1989 was not a
big pool of talent.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.671
And so you didn't necessarily
have to be that great.

00:02:47.671 --> 00:02:48.170
Got older.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.880
Went to college.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.980
Went to school in Minnesota.

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.990
The results started
to change for me.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.500
I started getting killed.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.060
And I did not handle that well.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.790
It was really disappointing
to me to lose races the way

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.200
I was losing races.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.400
My team, we qualified for
nationals our freshman year.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.590
And we got destroyed there
by schools like schools

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.990
out here, where it was sunny
and they rode all year.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.390
And we had been on
trainers all winter.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.910
I had reached a plateau.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.530
That wasn't the
progression that I

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.630
thought I would see from
the work I was getting.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:28.900
I saw people around me
who were working much less

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.190
and who were just really
beating me very badly.

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.255
So I kind of gave it up.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:35.350
I stopped riding.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.850
I actually stopped riding for
about 10 years, pretty much

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.400
full stop, because
it had never been

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.740
a recreational activity for me.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.725
It had always been a very
competitive activity.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.170
I still dream to go
into the Olympics.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.130
And I found a different
way to do that.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.180
Still some bad hair
choices there on the left.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.340
That's my credential for
the 1996 Olympics at SI.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.854
You can't see the ponytail.

00:04:01.854 --> 00:04:03.770
So I started my career
at "Sports Illustrated"

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.228
as a journalist and then have
been in Wired for nine years.

00:04:06.228 --> 00:04:09.980
I've covered three Olympics,
tons of other high-end sporting

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.480
events.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.660
And those questions really
still loomed in my mind.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.620
What separates great
athletes from even very,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:17.519
very good athletes?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.620
What are those
distinctions that lead

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.354
to being on the top
of the Olympic podium?

00:04:23.354 --> 00:04:25.270
And I've been lucky
enough, through my career,

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.280
to get to meet a lot
of those athletes

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.780
and coaches and scientists.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.230
And that's really where
this book came from.

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.100
One place that my
career took me was

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.766
to London on August 5, 2012.

00:04:38.766 --> 00:04:40.590
I'm going to play a quick video.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.410
This is the 100 meter final.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.610
One thing to watch here
is right before the final.

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120
It's going to happen sort
of behind those purple lane

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.790
markers.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.932
Somebody actually throws
a bottle from the stands

00:04:50.932 --> 00:04:53.390
and tries to hit the runners
before the start of this race.

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:55.100
Thankfully, that didn't work.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.540
But just something to watch.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.130
But we're going to watch
this race real quick.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.416
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:03.434 --> 00:05:05.392
-On their way, and Gatlin
got away brilliantly.

00:05:05.392 --> 00:05:07.872
And he's ahead at the moment.

00:05:07.872 --> 00:05:09.360
Bolt going [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.352
Here comes Usain Bolt!

00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:13.328
Usain Bolt storming
through, takes it again.

00:05:13.328 --> 00:05:16.800
Blake gets the silver-- 9.64.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.264
Oh, he's returned his title
in the most emphatic way.

00:05:21.264 --> 00:05:24.240
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:28.877
Usain Bolt of Jamaica is the
fastest man on the planet.

00:05:28.877 --> 00:05:29.710
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.560
MARK MCCLUSKY: So first of all,
let's talk about how awesome

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.510
that announcer is.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:36.740
You know, "He's
retained his title

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.130
in the most emphatic way."

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.010
And at the end
says, "Usain Bolt is

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:41.360
the fastest man on the planet."

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.810
And that's the
title that we give

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.890
the person who wins
the Olympic 100 meters.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:49.020
Incidentally, this was
my view of that moment.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:50.110
They do move pretty fast.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.000
You can see that my
camera couldn't quite

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.990
actually resolve the runners.

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:58.619
I actually love the sort
of abstract nature of this.

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:59.660
One other thing about it.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.930
This is the fastest
100 meters ever run.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.270
The first seven blurs there
finished under 10 seconds.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.940
And that's Asafa
Powell in the back.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.200
He pulled his
hamstring in the race,

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.560
and would have been
under 10 seconds.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.559
And there's never been a
race with eight runners

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.950
under 10 seconds before.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.710
Here's a slightly clearer view
of the finish of that race.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.160
This is the photo finish shot.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.522
So you think Usain Bolt's the
fastest man on the planet.

00:06:25.522 --> 00:06:27.730
And when you watch that
video, it does look emphatic.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:29.930
It looks like he's
destroyed these guys, right?

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.400
It's important to remember
how small the margins are

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.780
at the elite level.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:39.150
Will Hopkins is a
sports scientist

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.960
in New Zealand who's done a lot
of work trying to understand

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:44.650
the individual variation
of athletes' performances.

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.140
Not the differences between
athletes, but the difference

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:51.370
in an athlete in
his performances.

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.390
And by crunching a lot of
numbers, Will's a statistician.

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.410
In short track and field events,
that variation is about 0.8

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.070
of a percent.

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:03.880
So I've drawn a quick bell
curve of a 0.8% on either side.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:07.850
So if we just play with
a hypothetical here,

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:12.100
that means that Bolt could
have run as fast as 9:55,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.890
which destroys his
own world record.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:17.935
It's sort of an
otherworldly time.

00:07:17.935 --> 00:07:19.560
You could imagine
him running as slowly

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:23.820
is 9:71, which is still
great and ekes out the win.

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:24.782
Blake ran a 9:82.

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:29.720
But of course, Bolt's
not the only one

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.600
who has that variation.

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.558
So you can start to move
all these guys around.

00:07:32.558 --> 00:07:34.510
There's a scenario here,
with that variation,

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:37.880
at the same level of fitness,
the same sort of platonic state

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.370
that they were in,
where Yohan Blake wins

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:46.190
and Bolt and Gatlin
tie for the silver.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:46.740
It's fun.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.573
You can just really
start to mess with this.

00:07:48.573 --> 00:07:51.240
You can actually come with a
three-way dead heat for gold

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.660
and Tyson Gay just
out of the medals.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:55.220
It's just fun to
move these around.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.910
You can have a
four-way tie for bronze

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.482
if you really want
to mess with it.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:04.840
Now we're back to what
actually happened that day.

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.440
The point being that we
take these, in this case,

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.180
under 10 seconds,
and we think that is

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:15.830
the exact measurement
of the athlete.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:19.090
And it is the exact measurement
of that athlete for those 10

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.060
seconds.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.570
The next day, it's not the same.

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:27.040
An hour later, it's
maybe not the same.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:30.070
There's so many factors
that play into performance

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:32.730
at this level.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.070
So one of the ideas that I
really explore in the book

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:39.240
is how small those
margins are and what

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.230
it means to be playing at
that level with those margins.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:46.290
I want to talk about
a few ideas that

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.830
sort of cut across the book.

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:53.250
The book's organized by things
like nutrition and recovery

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.271
and what is fatigue
and skill acquisition.

00:08:55.271 --> 00:08:57.770
But then there are some sort
of themes that I think resonate

00:08:57.770 --> 00:08:58.603
throughout the book.

00:08:58.603 --> 00:09:00.910
And I want to talk about
those with you today.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.320
This is the first one.

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.460
Lots of little things
become big changes.

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.770
Dave Brailsford here.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:14.180
He took over British
Cycling about a decade ago.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:15.840
British Cycling was
a laughingstock.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.990
It was a terrible,
terrible program.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:21.560
Between 1924 and 1988, they
did not win a single gold medal

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.360
at the Olympics or
World Championships.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.620
They actually had won
two bronzes in that time

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:30.400
at the Olympics.

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:31.790
It was a mess.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:35.470
It was France, Germany, Italy.

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:38.380
Even the US had started
to outperform the Brits

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.750
in cycling, and
especially track cycling.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.330
And so they really started
to think about why that was.

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.850
And what did they need to
do to change their results?

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:52.220
And they came up with
a different approach.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.500
And Brailsford described
it as performance

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.560
through the aggregation
of marginal gains.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:00.070
What did he mean
by marginal gains?

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:02.830
We think of trying to
improve performance

00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.730
as this idea of, like, we
find one big, awesome thing,

00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:08.425
and suddenly we're 10%
better or 5% better.

00:10:08.425 --> 00:10:13.740
Or at the elite level, even
2% better is a huge change.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.190
I would argue that there
aren't many of those left,

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.140
especially at the elite level.

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:20.840
We're pretty good
at this stuff now.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.580
We've only been doing it about
150 years, sort of sports

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.090
as we think of them.

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.811
But we've optimized
a lot of things,

00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:29.810
and our understanding,
especially in the past 50

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:32.450
years, has really boomed.

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.080
It's really hard to
find a big thing.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.330
There are a couple that
people have been playing with,

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:38.950
and I'll talk about
some of those.

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.410
What Brailsford and British
Cycling sort of theorized was,

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:42.910
OK.

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:45.180
Like, let's stop
looking for big things.

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.520
So instead of one thing
that'll get me 10%,

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.450
let me start to add up 10
things at a percent each,

00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:53.900
or at a 0.10% each.

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.000
And when I stack these
on top of each other,

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.125
I start to get somewhere.

00:10:58.125 --> 00:11:00.040
These improvements
sort of accrue

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.560
like interest in this scenario.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.310
And those little
changes really add up.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:08.736
So let me give you some
examples of what they did.

00:11:08.736 --> 00:11:10.110
The first thing
they did was they

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:12.820
started to spend an immense
amount of time and energy

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.996
on their equipment.

00:11:14.996 --> 00:11:16.370
The nickname they
gave themselves

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:20.160
was the Secret Squirrel Club.

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.400
We would call it a
Skunk Works, right.

00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.770
But the British phrase
was Secret Squirrel Club.

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:31.190
Dimitris Katsanis was a Greek
competitive track cyclist

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:34.090
who then became a
composites engineer.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.273
So he was uniquely sort of
qualified when they came to him

00:11:37.273 --> 00:11:39.780
and said, build us the
fastest bike in the world.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.380
And so he went and
spent a couple of years

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:45.170
and built-- this is the
Mark II of the track frame.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.960
He built the Mark
I. His frames have

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.840
won over 50 gold medals at the
Olympic and World Championship

00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.340
level.

00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:55.550
They're incredibly
successful frames.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.990
They're crazy, crazy light,
they are incredibly stiff,

00:11:58.990 --> 00:12:00.375
and they are super aerodynamic.

00:12:00.375 --> 00:12:03.660
You can see some of the
shaping on the tubes.

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.280
They would do a lot of work.

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:08.660
British Motorsport is a very
huge resource, especially

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.720
on the aerodynamic side.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:14.100
All of the F1 constructors
live in Great Britain.

00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:17.000
And so they did a lot of
work with the F1 people.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.040
The handlebar there is
another thing they did.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.860
You can see the
shaping there, again,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.230
looking for aerodynamics.

00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:29.510
They called it the cobra, is
what the riders called it.

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:31.770
One thing that's interesting
about track cycling now,

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:34.620
and this is something
caused by this crazy arms

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.660
race on equipment,
is the UCI, which

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:38.405
is the world governing
body for cycling.

00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:44.820
They have to race on equipment
that can be purchased.

00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:48.125
You can't make bespoke gear that
is unavailable to the public.

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:53.840
So it's really hard to
buy because they actually

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.630
don't want to sell it.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.632
So it took me three emails
and a couple of phone

00:12:59.632 --> 00:13:01.840
calls for them to send me--
this is from the brochure

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.499
that I finally extracted
from British Cycling.

00:13:05.499 --> 00:13:07.290
I'm now going to put
up the prices for each

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.580
of these things.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:12.990
So that's a 25,000
pound track frame.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:14.200
So the frame's 25,000 pounds.

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.770
The bars are 23,000 pounds.

00:13:15.770 --> 00:13:16.480
So you add it up.

00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.170
That's 48,000, almost 49,000
pounds or approximately,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:27.470
according to Google's
search engine, $78,000.

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:29.960
And that's for a
frame and stems.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.680
No wheels, no equipment.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.550
The helmet that they
use, they will sell you

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.310
for about 10,000 pounds.

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:40.060
It's incredibly expensive gear.

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:41.527
It's very successful
gear, and they

00:13:41.527 --> 00:13:42.860
think it gives them a huge edge.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.220
So that's one gain.

00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:50.900
Anybody who's ever
slept in a hotel

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.610
has slept on a bad
pillow, and woken up

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:58.320
and their neck is killing them.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.350
British cyclists travel
with their own pillows

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.600
for that reason and for
another reason, which

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.880
is the same reason that they're
incredibly obsessive hand

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.080
washers and frankly won't shake
your hand when they meet you.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.937
Because you could be sick.

00:14:12.937 --> 00:14:14.770
Or you could have seen
someone who was sick,

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.000
or you could have been
around someone who was sick,

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.060
or somebody who was sick could
have been in your hotel room.

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:25.030
7% of competitors at the London
Olympics in 2012 got sick.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.620
And that sucks.

00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.960
Getting sick during the Olympics
after a lifetime of training

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.730
is a terrible, terrible
thing to have happen to you.

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.020
So anything you can do
to ameliorate that risk

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.060
is hugely important.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:43.950
Another trick in the British
Cycling arsenal, and not

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:46.802
just British cyclists,
is beet juice.

00:14:46.802 --> 00:14:50.720
This is kind of the hottest
performance drink in athletics

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.517
right now.

00:14:52.517 --> 00:14:53.350
Here's how it works.

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:57.210
So we all probably think
that nitrates and nitrates

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:00.040
are bad for us, because there
were studies done, usually

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.500
on processed meats, cured
meats, linking those

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.900
to possible higher
incidences of cancer.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.370
First of all, those
studies are really iffy,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.520
so I would suggest
you not worry about it

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.060
quite as much as perhaps you do.

00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:17.320
But also, it turns
out that nitrates

00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:19.240
have really interesting
effects on the bodies.

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.210
So beet juice is
very high in nitrate.

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:25.980
In the body, that's
turned into nitrite

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.500
and then into nitric oxide.

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:30.457
Nitric oxide in the
bloodstream does two things.

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:32.040
The first thing it
does is it actually

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.270
dilates the blood vessel.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:35.400
The blood vessel
gets bigger, and that

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.000
means that more blood flows
through that blood vessel.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.471
And that's good if you're
an endurance athlete

00:15:40.471 --> 00:15:42.470
because you're getting
more blood to the muscle.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:45.460
You can power your
efforts more effectively.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:49.500
The other is-- and this
is even more crazy--

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:51.410
it seems to make
the mitochondria

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:55.300
inside of that muscle
more efficient.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:59.290
So a two-for of I can get more
blood and oxygen to the muscle

00:15:59.290 --> 00:16:02.620
and the mitochondria use it more
efficiently is really awesome.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:04.570
That's sort of like, hurray.

00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:09.650
This is not so marginal.

00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.900
Right now, it looks
like about 3%,

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:17.810
and that's for efforts
between five and 30 minutes.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:21.389
For shorter efforts, for
efforts less than five minutes,

00:16:21.389 --> 00:16:23.180
this energy pathway
isn't really the energy

00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:25.900
pathway that powers that
sort of muscular work.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:28.230
For more than 30 minutes,
that research is ongoing.

00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:29.530
It's a little iffier.

00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:31.580
There's some studies
that seem pretty good.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:34.240
There are some that
seem not so good.

00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:36.482
But there is some hint that
even for longer efforts,

00:16:36.482 --> 00:16:37.315
it has that benefit.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.430
Ironically, it has more
benefit for people like me

00:16:43.430 --> 00:16:45.980
or any other weekend
warriors in the room

00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:47.930
than it does for elite athletes.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.000
They've optimized some of
those pathways already.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.892
They have incredibly
good capillary density

00:16:53.892 --> 00:16:54.600
in their muscles.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.641
So they're getting as much
blood as they possibly

00:16:56.641 --> 00:16:58.220
can to their muscles.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.000
I don't, because
I'm out of shape.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.160
And so this seems to
work better, actually,

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.800
for sort of recreationally
active athletes

00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.839
than elite athletes.

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:11.134
All that said, elite
athletes are using it

00:17:11.134 --> 00:17:13.050
because there doesn't
seem to be any downside.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.599
In fact, Andy Jones is
the researcher in the UK

00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:18.550
who's done most of
the work on this.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.630
His Twitter handle
is andybeetroot,

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:23.579
is how much he likes beet juice.

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:25.750
He was telling me that
during the London Olympics,

00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:29.160
it was actually very hard
to buy beet juice in London

00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:33.120
because all of the teams
were buying so much of it.

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.740
It does have one downside.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:36.790
Mark Cavendish is
a world champion.

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:43.870
And the hashtag
#pissingrainbows never quite

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.430
took off as much
as you might think.

00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:48.530
It was interesting when
you click on that hashtag

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:49.655
and see what else shows up.

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.690
Be ready for that.

00:17:55.690 --> 00:17:57.210
Yeah.

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:58.930
If you're going to
drink a lot of beet

00:17:58.930 --> 00:18:01.380
juice be ready, because
it will do things.

00:18:06.650 --> 00:18:10.490
Track races take place at a
standing start, track cycling

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:11.020
races.

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:15.769
So you're held either by a coach
or sort of in a timing device

00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:17.310
that sort of levers
the bike and lets

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.120
you go when the race starts.

00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:22.585
So that traction in that
moment is really important.

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:27.150
They believe, British
Cycling believes,

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:29.220
that by wiping down the
tires with isopropyl alcohol,

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.350
getting them as
clean as possible--

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:31.950
and it actually leaves
them slightly tacky,

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:33.783
depending on the rubber
compound-- that they

00:18:33.783 --> 00:18:36.280
get a little benefit
on that start.

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.030
It's maybe a
thousandth of a second,

00:18:39.030 --> 00:18:41.320
but thousandths of
a second matter.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:45.020
Like track races are won or lost
by a thousandth of a second.

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:48.850
One more here.

00:18:48.850 --> 00:18:53.510
This is Laura Trott, a
Great Britain cyclist.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:56.960
She's wearing hot
pants, which is

00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.430
what they called these warm-up
pants that they developed

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:03.360
with Adidas and one of the
universities in the UK.

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.220
They do huge warm-up,
and then there's

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:10.470
a holding area where the
cyclists have to sit and wait

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:12.280
for their race, sometimes
up to 30 minutes.

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.130
When you actually do that,
your muscles start to cool off.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.960
And part of the
point of the warm-up

00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.820
is to have the muscles warm
because that helps blood flow.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.500
These pants have
heating elements,

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.820
especially along the thighs
and the hamstrings, actually

00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:27.760
at 107 degrees.

00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.100
And so they would do their
warm-ups, they'd put them,

00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:34.340
and they'd sit there in the
area, in the holding area,

00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:40.060
with those on, peel them off,
get on the bike, do their race.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:45.780
Ironically, or perhaps not
ironically but interestingly,

00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.100
Australia showed up with
a very similar idea.

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:50.920
It was an idea
that everybody sort

00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.020
of-- that at least
those two countries,

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.300
which are sort of neck
and neck in sports

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:59.450
science in a lot of ways--
came to at the same time.

00:19:59.450 --> 00:20:02.280
The first study they published
is insane, the effectiveness.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.700
They found a 9% improvement
in sprint performance

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:07.260
on athletes who wore these.

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:09.490
I'll be interested to
see if that's replicable,

00:20:09.490 --> 00:20:12.020
because that's huge.

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.470
They aren't the most flattering
pant that was ever built.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:18.810
Laura probably didn't mind.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:20.685
This was after winning
her second gold medal.

00:20:20.685 --> 00:20:24.020
I love this picture of
her mom, especially.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.770
You add all of this up, and you
had an incredibly successful

00:20:26.770 --> 00:20:27.310
program.

00:20:27.310 --> 00:20:30.670
Of the 10 gold medals available
in track cycling in London,

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.904
the UK won seven of them.

00:20:32.904 --> 00:20:35.320
And would have won an eighth
except they were disqualified

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.329
for crossing a line on the track
by about a centimeter, which

00:20:39.329 --> 00:20:41.120
is not the sort of
mistake British cyclists

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.410
make very often, frankly.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.490
To me, it just really
shows the power

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:48.550
of adding up those
small gains, especially

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:51.350
in an elite environment where
the margins are so small.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:53.830
That if you really
interrogate every single thing

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.180
that you're doing, every
single part of your program,

00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.850
and try and optimize every
vector of it, it's hard to do.

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:00.350
Right?

00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:04.069
It's exhausting work
to think that way.

00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:05.610
But it can have
pretty huge benefits.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:11.660
The next idea I want to talk
about is this, n equals 1.

00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:15.500
For the science
types in the room,

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:20.720
N is the size of the population
under study in an experiment.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:24.050
Human beings are
incredibly individual.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:26.600
Crazily, crazily individual.

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:28.920
And I say that, and
everybody's like, yeah, yeah.

00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:30.487
We're individuals, right?

00:21:30.487 --> 00:21:31.070
No, seriously.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:34.900
We're like, really,
really, really individual.

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:41.800
So much of how we perform
in an athletic context

00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.290
comes down to genetic factors.

00:21:43.290 --> 00:21:46.670
It comes down to things that
are unique to each of us

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:51.340
as individuals, from nutrition
to motivation to how we respond

00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:53.470
to training and
to our physiology,

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.510
to our morphology, the
size of our bodies.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:59.650
And so I want to talk about
a couple of those things.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:22:03.630
Wendy Fox is a designer in
Melbourne who did this project.

00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:07.900
This is every female gold
medalist from London.

00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:09.240
She sells this awesome poster.

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.150
I would need to order one.

00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:18.040
She was kind enough to
let me use this material.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:22.320
This is one of those
gold medalists, a rower.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:27.410
Helen Glover had only
been rowing for four years

00:22:27.410 --> 00:22:28.640
when she won this gold medal.

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:35.200
And you might say,
hey, but 10,000 hours.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.390
OK, so I'm here to say that
10,000 hours isn't the be-all

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:42.590
and end-all because there are
things that sports require

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:48.680
of us that we may or may not
have innate abilities toward.

00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:52.870
Helen had been a competitive
field hockey player in the UK

00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:55.580
and a pretty good one.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.350
In the UK, it's
the county level.

00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:59.720
It's sort of like the
state level here in the US.

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:02.880
Not to the national or
international level.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.830
And she sort of plateaued there.

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:08.130
UK sport had this program,
and I love the name of it.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:09.900
They called it Sporting Giants.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:14.790
And in 2007, they put out
a call for tall athletes,

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.360
because there are some
sports where being tall

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.140
is really, really important.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:23.376
We all know basketball is
certainly one of those.

00:23:23.376 --> 00:23:24.500
Volleyball is one of those.

00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.958
Team handball, which is another
team sport in the Olympics,

00:23:26.958 --> 00:23:28.270
is one of them.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:30.920
Rowing is one of them.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:34.040
Being tall in rowing, all
other things being equal,

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.540
is awesome because
it's a physics problem.

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.660
You have a longer lever,
basically, to move an oar.

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.550
So if you were a woman who
was taller than 5' 11",

00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.080
you were asked to submit an
application to this program.

00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.090
For the men, I
believe it was 6' 2".

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:52.780
You might not 5'
11" is that tall.

00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:57.030
You sort of think, oh 5' 11"'s
tall, but not crazy tall.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:24:02.340
Fewer than 3% of women on the
planet are taller than 5' 10".

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.870
In the US, it's 2.4.

00:24:03.870 --> 00:24:06.010
In the UK, it's a
little less than that.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:07.190
So 5' 10"'s pretty tall.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:11.260
So fewer than 3% of women
were taller than 5' 10".

00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:14.210
16 of the 17 Olympic rowing
gold medalists were 5'

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.060
10" or taller.

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:16.970
It's really helpful.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.120
It's hard to compete
being shorter than that.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:24.430
I did leave off the
coxswain, who is not.

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:28.610
So that's cheating, I
guess. it's 16 of the 18.

00:24:31.804 --> 00:24:33.220
This is not an
average population.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:39.520
This is actually
the average woman

00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:42.070
in the United States,
is 5' 4" and 158 pounds.

00:24:45.812 --> 00:24:48.270
And then you line her up against
a couple of gold medalists

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.400
that show the range here.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.240
That's Gabby
Douglas, the gymnast,

00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:54.600
who's 5 inches shorter
and weighs 70 pounds less.

00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.760
Being small and light
as a gymnast or a diver,

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.130
again, a huge advantage.

00:24:59.130 --> 00:25:01.254
You're rotating a mass.

00:25:01.254 --> 00:25:02.670
You want something
short and light

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:04.090
because you can
rotate it faster.

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:07.770
You can complete more spins.

00:25:07.770 --> 00:25:12.130
Sylvia Fowles is
13 inches taller

00:25:12.130 --> 00:25:13.700
and weighs 43 pounds more.

00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.520
Obviously, Sylvia
at 6' 5" is actually

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:21.080
the tallest gold
medalist in London.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:28.310
That diversity of body type is
a relatively recent phenomenon

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.230
at the Olympic level.

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:32.390
David Epstein, who wrote a great
book called "The Sports Gene,"

00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:34.450
referred to it as the
Big Bang of body types.

00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:39.392
That there used to be a sort of
like generalized athlete body

00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:41.850
type in the middle, and that
that's really sort of exploded

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:44.530
into this diversity
that you see.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:48.000
There's no athlete
in the Olympic games

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.080
who's sort of average.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.120
It just doesn't happen.

00:25:55.170 --> 00:25:57.470
I don't have a name
for average woman USA.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.530
I keep thinking it would be
great to give her a name.

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:03.220
And let's think about
actually 100 of her.

00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:05.360
Because I want to talk
about another sort of factor

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:06.776
that leads into
elite performance,

00:26:06.776 --> 00:26:11.250
and that's your
response to training.

00:26:11.250 --> 00:26:12.700
This is Claude Bouchard.

00:26:12.700 --> 00:26:18.192
Claude is a researcher who
grew up in Quebec City.

00:26:18.192 --> 00:26:20.400
Tell me if this story sounds
familiar from the start.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.620
He was a hockey player.

00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:23.210
He was pretty good.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.390
Then he stopped growing.

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.690
Other guys got bigger.

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:27.474
And he wasn't able
to compete anymore.

00:26:27.474 --> 00:26:28.890
And when you talk
to him about it,

00:26:28.890 --> 00:26:30.931
he's like, I just didn't
know what was happening.

00:26:30.931 --> 00:26:34.750
I didn't know why I
couldn't get bigger.

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:37.370
And the answer is
well, because genetic.

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.230
We know that height is
about 70% heritable.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:43.950
And he didn't have the
genetics to get taller.

00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.430
Like me, those questions
sort of stuck with him.

00:26:46.430 --> 00:26:48.680
And as he started his
scientific career,

00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.920
he started wondering
about the genetic bases

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:54.450
of these differences
in athletic ability.

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.500
He started a study
called "Heritage,"

00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:01.630
which is sort of the key
study on genetic variation

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.910
as it applies to
athletic performance

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:06.711
and has been extracting data
from that for about 15 years.

00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:08.460
It's one of these huge
population studies.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:12.190
They took a huge group
of sedentary people,

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.380
put them on the same
training program,

00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:17.110
and then measured how
much they progressed.

00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:21.380
Your average person in
that 20-week program

00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:24.250
has an improvement somewhere
between 15 and 25%.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.420
And to be really
technical about it,

00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:28.790
that's the increase in
their VO2 max, their ability

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:30.905
to process oxygen as
an endurance athlete.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.400
So back to our 100
average woman USAs,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.890
60% sit right in the
middle of that bell curve,

00:27:39.890 --> 00:27:42.170
somewhere between 15%
and 25% improvement.

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.240
Those are your sort of
normal training responses.

00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.274
Another 25% have
responses that are

00:27:50.274 --> 00:27:51.690
a little further
out on the curve,

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.330
either below normal
or above normal,

00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.350
but not terribly extreme.

00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:58.810
So now we're down to
extreme responders,

00:27:58.810 --> 00:28:00.150
and we're down to 15%.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:04.360
We're down to 15 out of
our 100 average women.

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.610
7% to 8% of that
population will have

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:14.621
very low responses, like zero
improvement or 1% improvement.

00:28:14.621 --> 00:28:16.120
Matter of fact,
some of these people

00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.470
will show adverse responses.

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:21.490
Their cholesterol will go up.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:25.330
Their blood pressure will go up.

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.710
We don't ever even really
consider that possibility.

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:33.690
But for some people,
exercise is not a benefit.

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.160
So now we're left with 7%
or 8% of the population,

00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:40.700
again, with a high response
to aerobic endurance training.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:47.110
So these are people, like 8%
of the population roughly,

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:49.860
I would argue, even
has a shot here

00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.270
at reaching the elite level.

00:28:52.270 --> 00:28:55.480
You can be a normal responder
and have a high baseline

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.340
and have a nice athletic career.

00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.062
When you really look at
this sort of VO2 max values

00:29:01.062 --> 00:29:03.520
that you need to have to compete
at the elite level-- which

00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:08.450
are crazytown-- for women,
they tend to be in the 70s.

00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:10.850
For men, they're in
the mid 80s to even

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:15.360
there's been some
90s, which are insane.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.300
It's not even enough
to be a high responder.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.600
It's not even enough to be
one of these eight people

00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:22.450
because you need to also
have a high baseline.

00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:27.870
If I start from a 40 and
can get a 30% increase,

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:29.444
I'm nowhere near
where I need to be.

00:29:29.444 --> 00:29:30.360
I need to start at 50.

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:35.600
I need to start at 55, which is
already a pretty extreme value.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.900
You can crunch the
numbers on that.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:41.230
You get somewhere between 2%
and 3% of the population sort of

00:29:41.230 --> 00:29:44.770
has that combination
of high baseline

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:47.340
plus high trainability.

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:49.630
It's a pretty small slice.

00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:50.910
Before anything else happens.

00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:53.076
Before you even have to
start to train or work or do

00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:55.410
any of the things to actually
actualize any of this,

00:29:55.410 --> 00:29:57.780
that's a pretty small
chunk of the population

00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:01.120
that we're talking
about as given

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:04.850
the possibility of
this sort of success.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.739
Richard Lewontin has this
great quote that I really like.

00:30:08.739 --> 00:30:10.405
"Genes determine the
size of the bucket,

00:30:10.405 --> 00:30:12.363
and environment is how
much is poured into it."

00:30:12.363 --> 00:30:14.100
So for an athlete,
that environment

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:18.530
is work and practice
and opportunity.

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.070
Maybe I would have been, like,
a world-class soccer player.

00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:21.720
I don't know.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.245
I didn't really play soccer.

00:30:23.245 --> 00:30:27.050
So it wasn't even an
opportunity for me.

00:30:27.050 --> 00:30:29.567
This metaphor really
changed this summer

00:30:29.567 --> 00:30:30.650
with the ice bucket stuff.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:31.950
But I still like it.

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.230
Data has been a huge
theme, obviously.

00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:42.560
Coming to Google and
talking about data

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.080
is a little intimidating.

00:30:48.510 --> 00:30:51.410
It's really changed
sports, especially

00:30:51.410 --> 00:30:53.190
in the past 10
years, I would say.

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:56.730
But I want to go way
back to the '20s.

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.680
This is the Western
Electric plant

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.040
in Cicero, Illinois, also
known as the Hawthorne Works.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:09.904
And for those of you who have
done your social science stuff,

00:31:09.904 --> 00:31:11.820
there were really famous
experiments done here

00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.530
in the '20s and '30s,
sort of that dawn

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:16.950
of, like, scientific management.

00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:19.750
There were 40,000 workers
at this plant every day.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:23.200
And they were trying to
become more efficient.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.800
How can we make them
make more stuff?

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.750
And so researchers
from Harvard came out

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.600
and started doing
research on productivity.

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.190
And one of the groups
they researched

00:31:31.190 --> 00:31:34.720
was this group who made
telephone relay switches, which

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:39.580
were these big switches that
physically made your telephone

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.040
calls go where
they needed to go.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.670
There's some controversy
about these studies,

00:31:45.670 --> 00:31:48.630
like was the data good.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:54.270
So bear with me, because it's
a little apocryphal here.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:56.837
What they did is they started
to raise-- they're like, well,

00:31:56.837 --> 00:31:59.170
if we put more light in here,
maybe they can see better.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:00.300
Maybe the workers
can see better,

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:01.490
and they can make more switches.

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:02.560
And they turned up
the lights, and yeah.

00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.351
And lo and behold, they
made more switches,

00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:05.415
more relay switches.

00:32:05.415 --> 00:32:06.290
And they're like, OK.

00:32:06.290 --> 00:32:06.789
That's cool.

00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:09.000
And they turned the lights
back down to the level

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.375
that they started at, and the
workers made more switches.

00:32:14.402 --> 00:32:15.910
And they're like, OK.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:17.750
Well that's weird.

00:32:17.750 --> 00:32:19.084
What if we turn the lights down?

00:32:19.084 --> 00:32:20.958
And they turned the
lights down a little bit,

00:32:20.958 --> 00:32:22.210
and they made more switches.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:23.100
And then they turned them back.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.160
And so they do all these
environmental space.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.620
Heat, cold, all of this.

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.655
Everything made them
more productive.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:40.150
Which is the sort of thing
that scientific management

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:43.550
professors in the '20s
and '30s, were like, whoa.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.400
And so they tried
to figure out why.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:49.320
So here's where some
of the controversy is.

00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:50.980
The Hawthorne
effect is typically

00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.670
presented as the knowledge
that you are being observed,

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.030
being studied, causes you
to change your behavior.

00:33:00.691 --> 00:33:02.440
I think that's actually
pretty compelling.

00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:06.740
I don't know that these
studies actually prove that.

00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.570
One explanation,
just as a side note,

00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:10.520
is these weren't
workers who ever

00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:12.881
got much feedback at the time.

00:33:12.881 --> 00:33:13.380
Right.

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.024
And so they never really knew
how many switches they made.

00:33:16.024 --> 00:33:18.440
And suddenly they had somebody
in a lab coat standing over

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.050
them, saying, hey.

00:33:19.050 --> 00:33:19.925
You made 50 switches.

00:33:19.925 --> 00:33:21.375
Or you made 60 switches.

00:33:21.375 --> 00:33:22.000
Like, oh, cool.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.724
Maybe I can make 65.

00:33:23.724 --> 00:33:25.140
We've all experienced
that, right?

00:33:25.140 --> 00:33:29.640
You give me an artificial
goal, I'll try and surpass it.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:35.460
So it's possible that the
operators really got feedback,

00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.960
and almost coaching in a
way they never had before.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.380
Setting that aside, the idea
that we change our behavior

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:46.220
when we're tracking data
about ourselves, I think,

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.890
is kind of indisputable
at this point.

00:33:47.890 --> 00:33:51.411
We've seen this boom in
wearables in the consumer

00:33:51.411 --> 00:33:51.910
space.

00:33:55.296 --> 00:33:56.920
How many of you have
played with these?

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:03.630
And you notice that, like, even
if it's as silly as like, oh.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:05.610
I don't have 10,000
steps yet today,

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:07.985
and you're sort of marching
around your living room at 10

00:34:07.985 --> 00:34:10.330
o'clock at night,
that's behavior change.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.010
And behavior change
is really hard.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:16.169
The science of behavior change
is filled with failed attempts

00:34:16.169 --> 00:34:17.710
to get people to
change what they do.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:28.420
It's a really compelling way to
start to change your behavior.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.420
Now let's take that, put it
into an athletic context.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:35.826
And I'm going to go back to
myself racing bikes in 1987.

00:34:35.826 --> 00:34:37.409
So growing up in
western Pennsylvania,

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.739
there were no cycling coaches.

00:34:39.739 --> 00:34:41.050
Believe me.

00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:44.239
There was the guy at the bike
shop who was sort of my guru,

00:34:44.239 --> 00:34:46.670
and there was a book called
"Bicycle Road Racing," written

00:34:46.670 --> 00:34:48.980
by Eddie Borysewicz, who
had been the US Cycling Team

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:50.219
coach in 1984.

00:34:50.219 --> 00:34:51.625
He was a Polish guy.

00:34:51.625 --> 00:34:56.164
But one of Eddie's tips in that
book was if it was hot out,

00:34:56.164 --> 00:34:57.330
you had your cycling cap on.

00:34:57.330 --> 00:34:59.700
Because you didn't wear a helmet
because that wasn't a thing

00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:00.658
that cyclists did then.

00:35:00.658 --> 00:35:03.240
If it was hot out, you
could put a cabbage leaf

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:06.430
underneath your
cycling cap, just

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.390
like tour riders did
in the '20s and '30s.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.957
We no longer carried our
spare tires looped like that,

00:35:11.957 --> 00:35:13.790
although I think it's
a pretty awesome look.

00:35:16.580 --> 00:35:20.050
That was the advice that
I got from the guy who

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:22.017
coached in the
Olympic team in 1984.

00:35:22.017 --> 00:35:22.850
It's a cabbage leaf.

00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.550
AUDIENCE: Did it help?

00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:31.040
MARK MCCLUSKY: Um,
it kind of does.

00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:34.820
Yeah, it kind of does help.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:39.219
In the mid '70s, Polar,
the Finnish company,

00:35:39.219 --> 00:35:40.760
created the first
heart rate monitor.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:41.390
This isn't it.

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:43.310
This is the one that
came out in 1987.

00:35:43.310 --> 00:35:46.200
They developed the first
wireless heart rate monitor

00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:49.810
in 1977 for Finnish
cross country skiers

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:51.810
to help them in their training.

00:35:51.810 --> 00:35:55.090
In 1987, they released
this model, the PE300.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.400
I bought one of these.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.920
I had a job.

00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.890
And I took every cent
that I made in that job,

00:36:00.890 --> 00:36:02.250
and I bought gear.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:03.955
And nothing has changed.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:11.790
The idea of training with
heart rate was crazy new.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:14.630
And what this had,
the first-- this

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:16.880
was the first thing
that actually introduced

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.430
the idea of target
heart rate zones

00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:22.790
to anyone outside of a
super-elite training program.

00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:25.232
So you'd measure your
resting heart rate

00:36:25.232 --> 00:36:26.690
and then sort of
like do some math.

00:36:26.690 --> 00:36:28.720
It's like, well, if I'm training
here, I'm training really hard.

00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.844
And if I'm training here,
I'm not training so hard.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:34.590
So great.

00:36:34.590 --> 00:36:36.340
I had that thing
strapped to my handlebars

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.890
and tried to divine
the information from it

00:36:38.890 --> 00:36:40.325
with no coach or feedback.

00:36:42.830 --> 00:36:46.195
Two nights ago, I did this ride.

00:36:46.195 --> 00:36:48.060
So this is on a
Wahoo Kickr, which

00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:51.310
is this really amazing
resistance trainer and trainer

00:36:51.310 --> 00:36:51.970
road.

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.290
So this is the power
profile that I rode.

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.640
It's an easy ride because,
like I said, I'm out of shape.

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:04.170
This level of information
and data about my performance

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:09.060
and what I did would have
made my head probably explode

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.670
as a 17-year-old.

00:37:10.670 --> 00:37:11.170
Right.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.860
I'm just sort of like,
I just went and rode.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.920
At the same time,
actually, Greg LeMond

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.430
and some of his
colleagues were starting

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:19.830
to do the first work on power.

00:37:19.830 --> 00:37:22.880
One nice thing about
a bike and also rowing

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.577
is you can directly measure
the power that you output.

00:37:27.577 --> 00:37:29.660
So I could do this ride
one day, and my heart rate

00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:31.635
could be pretty low
because I felt great.

00:37:31.635 --> 00:37:33.010
I could do this
ride another day,

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:35.335
my heart rate could be 20
beats higher because I'm sick

00:37:35.335 --> 00:37:36.959
or I'm fighting an
infection or I'm not

00:37:36.959 --> 00:37:38.590
recovered from my previous ride.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.166
Heart rate's an OK way
to approximate this.

00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:42.540
Power's an incredible
way to know

00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:48.170
exact-- I produced 250
kilojoules of energy

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:50.550
in that ride, which
is not that much.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:57.940
This ability to really get
into these things, this

00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.640
is another example of it.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.434
Zwift has actually
just launched this.

00:38:01.434 --> 00:38:02.850
For the cyclists
in the room, this

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:08.010
is a massively multiplayer
virtual cycling game

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:10.280
that you can play with
your power trainer.

00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.460
And you network
around the world.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.070
Here's what's nuts.

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.520
Five pro teams,
like pro tour teams,

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.450
have talked about the fact
that their scouting people

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:24.570
in this game.

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:26.401
Because watts are watts.

00:38:26.401 --> 00:38:26.900
Right?

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.120
The numbers don't lie.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.010
If I could go out and put out,
famously, a little over 6 watts

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.530
a kilogram for an hour,
I have the physiology

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.790
to win the Tour de France or at
least be in the conversation.

00:38:39.790 --> 00:38:44.290
So if it's some dude on a
trainer in Omaha, that's fine.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:45.695
I know what he can do.

00:38:45.695 --> 00:38:48.320
He might not be able to handle
a bike, and we can work on that.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.880
But the physiology
is the tough part.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.588
I just think it's
incredible that they're

00:38:51.588 --> 00:38:54.630
scouting riders in this way.

00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:57.940
The wearable for consumers
are well and good.

00:38:57.940 --> 00:39:00.150
This is sort of the
professional version of it.

00:39:00.150 --> 00:39:01.500
Catapult sports makes this.

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.470
It's called the OptimEye S5.

00:39:03.470 --> 00:39:06.430
Catapult came out of a project
of the Australian Institute

00:39:06.430 --> 00:39:08.490
of Sport, where they
were really looking

00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:15.430
to track athletes' movement
in competitive settings.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:19.205
So this little guy, this
is a British rugby player.

00:39:19.205 --> 00:39:22.840
They tuck it in between
the shoulder blades there.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:26.410
It's worn in lots of sort
of commonwealthy sports,

00:39:26.410 --> 00:39:27.460
so Aussie rules football.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:29.950
Rugby players wear it.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:32.960
Tons of US teams have
started using it in practice.

00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:35.740
It's not legal in games
yet in the United States.

00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.280
And the people who are
least interested in having

00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.440
it in competitive
settings right now

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.500
are the players, or specifically
the players' unions.

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.845
Because I know now, like,
say at contract time,

00:39:50.845 --> 00:39:51.720
you know, like, yeah.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:55.130
You were great last year, but
this year, your average sprint

00:39:55.130 --> 00:39:58.250
acceleration's down a
meter and a half a second.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:39:59.030
What's wrong?

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.510
Have you been staying
out too late at night?

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:02.843
Because I'm sort of tracking
your sleep now, too, or I'd

00:40:02.843 --> 00:40:05.400
like to be.

00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:08.480
I mean these concerns
about privacy

00:40:08.480 --> 00:40:11.190
are a really
interesting subject.

00:40:11.190 --> 00:40:14.390
Culturally, I think, we
have a very different stance

00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:16.510
toward that than a lot
of other countries do.

00:40:16.510 --> 00:40:18.080
This is commonplace.

00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:21.300
So in Aussie rules
football, they actually

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.860
use it like real-time telemetry.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:26.780
So I'm sure there are
lots of Aussie rules fans

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.486
watching and in the room.

00:40:29.486 --> 00:40:31.110
It's kind of a weird,
interesting game.

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:33.557
One facet of it is you do
substitutions in real time.

00:40:33.557 --> 00:40:35.140
Like the flow of the
game doesn't stop

00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.980
and people run off and on.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.630
And so they're getting
feeds from their players

00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:43.130
onto an iPad showing things
like that acceleration rate.

00:40:43.130 --> 00:40:45.920
And, like, if Jim
isn't accelerating

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.169
the way he did at the
start of the game, maybe

00:40:48.169 --> 00:40:50.210
he's the player I should
be taking off for a rest

00:40:50.210 --> 00:40:51.910
right now.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:55.925
It's kind of like an F1 race
but with people and balls

00:40:55.925 --> 00:40:58.740
and tackling one another.

00:40:58.740 --> 00:40:59.970
One other thing about data.

00:40:59.970 --> 00:41:01.530
This is Kirk Goldsberry.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:05.290
I write about Kirk in the book,
and we did an excerpt in Wired

00:41:05.290 --> 00:41:07.947
about him.

00:41:07.947 --> 00:41:08.780
He's a cartographer.

00:41:08.780 --> 00:41:10.290
He teaches at Harvard.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:16.460
And he's also a crazy basketball
fan and basketball player.

00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.740
And as he watched NBA games,
he thought to himself,

00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:22.500
from his experience
as a player, I

00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.550
have places on the court where
I'm really comfortable, where

00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:25.380
I love taking shots.

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.713
And I have places on the court
where I'm not comfortable

00:41:27.713 --> 00:41:29.505
and where I'm terrible
at taking shots.

00:41:29.505 --> 00:41:32.480
And do NBA players
have that same thing?

00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.171
So it's an interesting question.

00:41:34.171 --> 00:41:35.920
The first trick in
answering that question

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:39.050
is finding the
data to answer it.

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.510
What Kirk ended up doing
is ESPN was running

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.490
shot charts on their box scores.

00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:50.430
And he scraped all the data
from that quasi-legally-ish

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:53.110
and eventually was
able to map every shot

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:57.590
that every player in the NBA
took over a five-year span.

00:41:57.590 --> 00:42:00.654
And then compare individual
players to that baseline,

00:42:00.654 --> 00:42:01.820
and you get two things here.

00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.750
So this is Dirk Nowitzki
of the Dallas Mavericks.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:08.330
Size of the dot is how often
the player shoots from there.

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:11.010
The color from sort
of cool to warm

00:42:11.010 --> 00:42:13.210
is how effective they are
from that area compared

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.180
to the average player.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.072
So you see Dirk's a
great three-point shooter

00:42:17.072 --> 00:42:17.780
from straight on.

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.750
He's an unbelievable
mid-range shooter,

00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:22.604
especially from the
right side of the court.

00:42:22.604 --> 00:42:24.270
He's actually the
best mid-range shooter

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.900
in basketball, which, is frankly
not a very efficient shot.

00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.010
The style of the time right
now is to shoot three pointers

00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:36.505
or try and be shooting layups
or close to the basket.

00:42:39.010 --> 00:42:42.130
So he was able to extract that
from sort of rudimentary data.

00:42:42.130 --> 00:42:44.800
At the same time,
there's a camera

00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:46.880
right there at the
bottom of the screen.

00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.040
And this is at the
United Center in Chicago.

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.830
Stats Inc., which
is this company that

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:57.030
provides statistical information
to most US pro leagues,

00:42:57.030 --> 00:43:00.675
had acquired this technology
called Sport View.

00:43:00.675 --> 00:43:03.660
It began as Israeli
missile defense technology

00:43:03.660 --> 00:43:07.440
to try and optically
detect missile launches

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:12.240
and was adapted to sports, first
soccer and then basketball.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:15.230
Because tracking everything
that happens on a basketball

00:43:15.230 --> 00:43:16.910
court is hard.

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:20.901
So there are six cameras,
and it tracks the position

00:43:20.901 --> 00:43:23.150
of everything on the court,
all the players, the ball,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.010
the officials 25 times a second.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:29.350
So you get basically
an x, y coordinate

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:31.206
for each of those things
25 times a second.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.210
So with that kind of
data, you can go well

00:43:35.210 --> 00:43:36.770
beyond just sort
of a shot chart.

00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:38.330
You can ask different questions.

00:43:38.330 --> 00:43:42.130
So here's the next
question Kirk answered.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:45.700
This is the scoring
percentage that NBA players

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:48.250
have on average
close to the hoop.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:49.750
This is the most
important territory

00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:52.280
on the basketball
court to defend.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:56.740
And you can see, like,
players are really successful

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:57.930
scoring there.

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.160
But when you swap in
different defenders, what

00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:03.240
happens to people taking
shots in that area?

00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:07.810
So any Warriors fans in
the house, David Lee,

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:12.830
who's been injured this year,
is a terrible interior defender.

00:44:12.830 --> 00:44:14.330
I really like David
Lee as a player,

00:44:14.330 --> 00:44:16.120
but this is not David
Lee's strong suit.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.760
David Lee is a good
scorer and rebounder.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.210
He does not perform
particularly well.

00:44:22.210 --> 00:44:25.060
We'll see what his
next contract looks

00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.430
like based on that information.

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:27.888
Scoring and rebounding
are actually

00:44:27.888 --> 00:44:29.670
easier to find than defense.

00:44:29.670 --> 00:44:34.570
Larry Sanders is an
incredible interior defender.

00:44:34.570 --> 00:44:36.920
He signed a $44 million
dollar contract the summer

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.830
after Kirk published
this research.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:42.180
With the Bucks, he scores,
like six points a game.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.697
It's about his defense.

00:44:44.697 --> 00:44:46.030
There's one other way to defend.

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:50.890
And that's to stop your opponent
from even taking a shot.

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:53.450
So this looks at what happens
when an opponent takes a shot.

00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:56.650
You can crunch the same
numbers a different way.

00:44:56.650 --> 00:44:58.970
What defender, by
his mere presence,

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.430
suppresses shooting rates?

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:05.080
And when you do that,
it was to Dwight Howard.

00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:08.660
So he was a Laker at the time
that Kirk did this research.

00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:14.800
Opponents shoot 9% fewer shots
when Howard is near the basket.

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.755
Like imagine if he
blocked 9% of shots.

00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:17.630
It's the same effect.

00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.820
Right?

00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:19.140
It's the virtual blocked shot.

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:21.410
It's an incredible thing.

00:45:21.410 --> 00:45:25.320
In the crowd that day,
when Kirk presented this

00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.870
at the Sloan Sports
Analytics Conference at MIT--

00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:32.150
Daryl Morey is the GM
of the Houston Rockets.

00:45:32.150 --> 00:45:37.390
And later that summer,
he signed Dwight.

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.570
I cannot confirm nor deny that
it's exactly because of that,

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:43.070
but it certainly
would have held up,

00:45:43.070 --> 00:45:46.971
because he does like seeing
this sort of shot blocking.

00:45:46.971 --> 00:45:48.470
A couple more quick
things, and that

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:51.850
is the importance of
getting the basics right.

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:52.520
Atul Gawande.

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.380
in his book "Better"
talks about this a lot.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:58.430
He talks about we're so
bad at doing the things

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:00.040
that we actually know work.

00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:01.930
We're constantly
drawn to the new,

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:03.820
to the novelty of
a new discovery

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.821
and not just like basic
blocking and tackling.

00:46:06.821 --> 00:46:07.320
Right?

00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:10.430
So a couple of quick ones.

00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:11.000
Eating well.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.390
The most popular food
venue for Olympians

00:46:17.390 --> 00:46:19.470
is that at the Olympic games.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:22.660
Here's a picture Bobby Lee took.

00:46:22.660 --> 00:46:25.300
Now, in fairness, this is right
after the closing ceremony.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:26.840
So the line's a
little bit longer.

00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:28.730
But McDonald's is a
huge worldwide sponsor

00:46:28.730 --> 00:46:29.396
of the Olympics.

00:46:29.396 --> 00:46:32.980
And every Olympiad, you read
about people who go and eat

00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:36.490
like 55 Big Macs and
then, like, wonder

00:46:36.490 --> 00:46:40.280
why they aren't
performing very well.

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:46.751
I think for most of us, diet
is a really fraught thing.

00:46:46.751 --> 00:46:50.080
I think we look for these fads.

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.100
We look for these
quick fixes again.

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:54.410
And this is another place
where our individuality

00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:55.920
is incredibly profound.

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:57.990
I have colleagues who've
lost a ton of weight

00:46:57.990 --> 00:47:02.240
on low-carb, high-fat diets.

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:04.730
I should not be on a
low-carb, high-fat diet.

00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:07.500
That's not how my body
processes nutrients.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:10.410
Everybody's body does
things differently.

00:47:10.410 --> 00:47:13.300
Phil Wagner is a sports
scientist down here in Menlo

00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:16.522
Park and has a lab called
Sparta Performance Science.

00:47:16.522 --> 00:47:18.480
His whole thing is just
trying to give athletes

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:19.560
a couple of things.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.460
He's like, it's so hard to get.

00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:24.690
I can't give them this
complicated regimen to follow.

00:47:24.690 --> 00:47:27.180
So he's got two rules that he
asks his athletes to follow.

00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.160
He wants them to eat
1 gram of protein

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:31.510
per pound of body weight a day.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.600
And he wants them to have
eight fist-size servings

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.006
of vegetables.

00:47:35.006 --> 00:47:35.810
It's like, look.

00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:37.550
If they do that,
they've done, like,

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.870
80% of what I need them to do.

00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:42.310
And given their travel demands
and the schedule on them,

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.410
that's hard enough sometimes.

00:47:45.410 --> 00:47:49.490
Here's the other one,
and that's sleep more.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:55.640
We have this incredibly
strange cultural bias

00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.540
against sleep in
the United States.

00:47:59.540 --> 00:48:01.745
We have this, like, faux
machismo about, like,

00:48:01.745 --> 00:48:03.870
I only need four hours a
night, like that's somehow

00:48:03.870 --> 00:48:05.530
an awesome thing.

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.080
This is the 2005
Stanford basketball team.

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.050
They weren't great.

00:48:09.050 --> 00:48:10.590
They went 16 and 4 that year.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:14.577
Sorry for any Stanford
alums in the room.

00:48:14.577 --> 00:48:16.660
But Cheri Mah, who is a
researcher at the Stanford

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:19.970
Sleep Center, did a really
fascinating experiment

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:20.690
with these guys.

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.760
They volunteered to
study the effects

00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:27.490
not of sleep deprivation
but of sleep extension.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:32.634
So when they started
the study, they

00:48:32.634 --> 00:48:34.800
reported that they slept
almost eight hours a night.

00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:37.880
Actually, by using tools, they
discovered that they actually

00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:42.410
slept about 6 and
2/3 hours a night.

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.442
So they measured their
baseline amount of sleep

00:48:44.442 --> 00:48:45.650
and then did testing on them.

00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:48.090
They tested them in
sprint performance,

00:48:48.090 --> 00:48:50.080
doing a shuttle run,
shooting free throws,

00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.534
shooting three pointers.

00:48:51.534 --> 00:48:53.200
Then they asked every
player on the team

00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.650
to sleep as much as
they possibly could,

00:48:55.650 --> 00:48:58.830
do everything they
could to sleep more.

00:48:58.830 --> 00:48:59.644
And they did.

00:48:59.644 --> 00:49:00.560
They slept a lot more.

00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:02.740
They slept 100
minutes a night more,

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:08.160
which is almost 8 1/2 hours
a night of actual sleep.

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:12.840
And they got better at playing
basketball because of that.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.620
The sprint times went down.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:17.050
This is out of 10 free throws.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:19.950
They made 9% more free throws.

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:23.220
And out of 15
three-pointers, they

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:27.170
made an extra 1 and change.

00:49:27.170 --> 00:49:29.330
You know, 9%
performance improvement

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:34.540
is the sort of thing you
usually get from doping.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:35.150
You know?

00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:39.330
So I'd encourage you to think of
sleep not as a necessary evil,

00:49:39.330 --> 00:49:41.060
but as a performance enhancer.

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.900
And I'm completely
fascinated by sleep.

00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:48.150
The only sustainable
advantage is to learn faster.

00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:52.060
This is something Scott
Drawer, who worked at UK Sport,

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:53.020
said this to me.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:56.750
And it comes out of
Shell, Royal Dutch Shell.

00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:58.210
And actually, this
is Arie de Geus,

00:49:58.210 --> 00:50:01.380
who ran the strategic planning
operation at Royal Dutch Shell

00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:04.300
and really invented a lot of
the idea of scenario planning.

00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:08.210
How do you come up with business
strategies for scenarios

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.610
that may or may not
occur in the future?

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:13.690
And that was his thought.

00:50:13.690 --> 00:50:17.190
That anything you do,
your competition's

00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:19.490
going to ape almost immediately.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:22.430
So the trick is that you have
to be able to learn faster.

00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:25.350
The way you get to
a moment like this

00:50:25.350 --> 00:50:29.410
is to not be stuck in
your ways, to not get

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.570
stuck in your thinking,
and to challenge

00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.290
all of your
assumptions constantly.

00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:36.020
And, as I said,
that is exhausting.

00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.480
It's brutal.

00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:40.410
But that's what these guys face.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:45.580
The joy and the torment they
face is that today's crazy,

00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:47.480
new experiment is
tomorrow's baseline.

00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:49.110
And you just have
to keep challenging

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:51.230
yourself to move forward.

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:53.010
So thanks for having me.

00:50:53.010 --> 00:50:55.625
This is my website if
you want to go there.

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.537
RACHEL O'MEARA:
Who has a question?

00:51:02.537 --> 00:51:03.120
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.244
Thanks for coming to speak.

00:51:04.244 --> 00:51:07.800
You mentioned that data
has been helping the sports

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.000
science explode in
the last 10 years.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.920
Why do you think
this is happening now

00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.037
as opposed to 20 years ago?

00:51:14.037 --> 00:51:15.870
MARK MCCLUSKY: On the
data front especially,

00:51:15.870 --> 00:51:18.000
it's the availability
of sensor technology.

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:18.500
Right?

00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:20.590
It's the fact that all
of us in our pockets

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:22.840
have something that has a
gyroscope, an accelerometer,

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.390
a GPS.

00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:26.970
Those things were really
specialized pieces

00:51:26.970 --> 00:51:28.700
of equipment before smartphones.

00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:32.870
I think the boom in
sensors and the way

00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:35.770
that their price has just
plummeted really has opened up

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:40.449
that market, especially
for normal folks.

00:51:40.449 --> 00:51:42.740
AUDIENCE: So you mentioned
the picture about the camera

00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:43.840
on the NBA court.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.530
So does that mean that
it can automatically

00:51:46.530 --> 00:51:49.370
analyze all the pictures,
who takes the shot, where

00:51:49.370 --> 00:51:52.170
and those data available
right now for analysis?

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.080
MARK MCCLUSKY: Yeah.

00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:57.300
So getting the whole data set,
you have to know somebody.

00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:03.218
Probably somebody
here knows somebody.

00:52:03.218 --> 00:52:07.689
The NBA actually publishes now
on their site, nba.com/stats,

00:52:07.689 --> 00:52:10.230
they publish a lot of statistics
derived from that Sport View

00:52:10.230 --> 00:52:11.460
data.

00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:15.140
But before last
season, the league

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.040
paid to have it
installed in every arena.

00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.379
It had only been in
about 15 before that.

00:52:19.379 --> 00:52:19.920
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:21.630
And are there
other sports do you

00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:24.230
think like, camera-based
or image-processing

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:27.889
based technology can enable
more improvements in the sports?

00:52:27.889 --> 00:52:29.430
MARK MCCLUSKY: So
I mean, a lot of it

00:52:29.430 --> 00:52:37.160
is about baseball
has had Sportvision,

00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:39.000
which is just down
the road here.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.940
Does PITCHf/x and
FIELDf/x, which

00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:44.840
tracks the movement of the ball
and the movement of players

00:52:44.840 --> 00:52:46.160
on the court.

00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:49.340
Tennis uses optical technology
to call in and out now.

00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.730
So there's an
interesting, I think,

00:52:51.730 --> 00:52:54.190
balance between sort
of physical sensors

00:52:54.190 --> 00:52:57.440
and that sort of
image-based thing.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.940
You know, outdoor sports,
it's much easier if I just

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:03.770
slap a GPS on you and trace
you in the accelerometer

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:04.960
and do it that way.

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.510
Indoor sports don't
have that luxury.

00:53:06.510 --> 00:53:09.070
So they have some other things
they need to figure out.

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:12.760
AUDIENCE: So you talked
scouting cyclists

00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.370
based on the Zwift
data, for example.

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:15.828
And you also talked
about genetics.

00:53:15.828 --> 00:53:18.300
I have two kids, like five
years old and two years old.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.510
Do you see a structured way
of scouting future athletes

00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:25.230
when they are young or
when they are teenagers?

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.506
MARK MCCLUSKY: I mean,
that's sort of the thing

00:53:27.506 --> 00:53:29.630
that everybody holds up,
is, like, someday there'll

00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:32.420
be a genetic test you
can give your kid.

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:37.530
And, oh, little
Billy can be an x.

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.960
I'll never say never when it
comes to science like that.

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.620
But we're a long way from that.

00:53:41.620 --> 00:53:45.290
Let me go back to height, right?

00:53:45.290 --> 00:53:50.202
Height's a pretty simple
trait in terms of the outcome.

00:53:50.202 --> 00:53:52.660
When you start to look at the
snips involved, when you look

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:56.580
at the actual genetic
variant on the genome that

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.880
seems to be associated with
that variance in height,

00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:02.650
there's something on the
order of 300,000 snips.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:05.670
So if something pretty
straightforward like height

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:07.880
has that huge a data
set that we have

00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:11.440
to look at that influences
it, something that

00:54:11.440 --> 00:54:13.000
seems much more
complicated to me,

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.074
not as a geneticist,
athletic ability,

00:54:16.074 --> 00:54:17.490
I can't imagine
that we're talking

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:21.090
about fewer snips than
300,000 certainly.

00:54:21.090 --> 00:54:22.820
So when people talk
about sports genes,

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:25.430
there have been genes
like ACE and actin

00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:28.920
that seem to have
some association with

00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:33.080
increased either sprint
ability or endurance ability.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:38.080
But you can't draw a
line between a gene.

00:54:38.080 --> 00:54:40.917
I think that was the sort
of dream of early genetics.

00:54:40.917 --> 00:54:41.500
It's like, oh.

00:54:41.500 --> 00:54:42.749
There's a gene for everything.

00:54:42.749 --> 00:54:46.100
It's, like, well, actually,
there is a gene for everything.

00:54:46.100 --> 00:54:48.020
But every gene is for
everything in some ways.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:55.770
So what I think we'll see
structurally in sports

00:54:55.770 --> 00:55:00.060
is a bigger effort
to match athletes

00:55:00.060 --> 00:55:04.360
to sports based on
their physiology

00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:05.360
and their morphology.

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:09.140
Like that sort of height
stuff that I talked about.

00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.570
My dream of playing in
the NBA died the day

00:55:11.570 --> 00:55:14.510
that I stopped growing
at 5' 11 and 3/4".

00:55:16.940 --> 00:55:18.690
AUDIENCE: In terms of
the different sports

00:55:18.690 --> 00:55:22.100
and different countries, how
does the technology evolve?

00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:24.890
Is it like a specific country
that really drives something?

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:26.980
Or what sports are
leading in what way?

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:27.813
MARK MCCLUSKY: Yeah.

00:55:27.813 --> 00:55:30.200
That's a great
question, I think.

00:55:30.200 --> 00:55:33.840
Let me take the countries first.

00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:35.770
Going even further
back, the Soviet bloc

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:38.310
in the '60s and '70s is,
frankly, where a lot of this

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.554
really got going.

00:55:40.554 --> 00:55:42.970
In some ways that were really
amazing in terms of research

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:45.890
and in some ways that were
really horrific in terms

00:55:45.890 --> 00:55:48.947
of what happened to athletes in
terms of state-sponsored doping

00:55:48.947 --> 00:55:51.030
programs, when they were
told, take your vitamins,

00:55:51.030 --> 00:55:55.250
and it was really testosterone,
which is an effective way

00:55:55.250 --> 00:55:56.850
to be a better
athlete but to live

00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:59.980
a really awful life eventually.

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:01.630
After that,
Australia really took

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:05.490
the lead in the '80s and
'90s and sort of the lead-up

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.250
to the Sydney Olympics.

00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:08.840
Australia made a
huge investment.

00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:10.860
They opened the
Australian Institute

00:56:10.860 --> 00:56:13.632
of Sport, which has really
been a world leader here.

00:56:13.632 --> 00:56:15.590
And that was really the
first place in the West

00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:20.170
that brought together
raw scientific research

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:22.610
and an elite
athletic population.

00:56:22.610 --> 00:56:26.840
Because doing this research
on a non-elite population

00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:29.290
is meaningless in a lot of ways.

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.110
In the past two or
three Olympic cycles,

00:56:34.110 --> 00:56:36.210
the UK has really
been ascendant.

00:56:36.210 --> 00:56:39.380
Part of that is because they
launched the national lottery

00:56:39.380 --> 00:56:42.160
in the UK, and a quarter of the
money from the national lottery

00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:45.840
is given to UK Sport for high
performance sports funding

00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.530
and research.

00:56:47.530 --> 00:56:52.110
The US spends zero dollars
as a country on any of this.

00:56:52.110 --> 00:56:56.760
The UK spends $400
million or so a year.

00:56:56.760 --> 00:56:57.899
We're a growth market.

00:56:57.899 --> 00:56:59.690
The USOC funds some of
this, but that's all

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.410
from corporate donations.

00:57:01.410 --> 00:57:04.100
In terms of sports, I
think endurance sports

00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:06.640
have traditionally
led a lot of this

00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:08.350
because they're
easier to measure.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:13.830
Just cycling, running,
rowing, cross country skiing.

00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:17.130
And they're a little more
directly physiologically

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:18.592
determined.

00:57:18.592 --> 00:57:20.550
There are other things,
but at a certain point,

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:22.800
the size of your engine and
your physiological ability

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:24.036
is really important.

00:57:24.036 --> 00:57:25.160
Team sports are way behind.

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:27.040
Team sports in the US
are way, way behind,

00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:29.107
but catching up very quickly.

00:57:29.107 --> 00:57:30.690
AUDIENCE: So at the
end, you mentioned

00:57:30.690 --> 00:57:32.030
about learning faster.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:34.810
And that seems like
quite a compelling idea.

00:57:34.810 --> 00:57:39.300
And I was curious to understand
if that's also something that

00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:42.270
comes with a natural baseline
and a natural rate of growth

00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:47.110
or improvement, or if
that is more learnable.

00:57:47.110 --> 00:57:49.676
MARK MCCLUSKY: Is
learning learnable?

00:57:49.676 --> 00:57:50.800
AUDIENCE: Or fast learning.

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:53.230
MARK MCCLUSKY: Yes I would
say probably a little.

00:57:53.230 --> 00:58:00.170
I mean, the answer to
nature or nurture is both.

00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:02.080
Right?

00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:04.130
And so I think that
there are probably

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.730
people who have Carol Dweck's
talked a lot about growth

00:58:06.730 --> 00:58:10.320
mindsets, and that's really
helpful in this context

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:14.210
because, again, you're
challenging your own ideas

00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:15.320
constantly.

00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.900
And it seems like
some people are

00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.600
more inclined to that worldview.

00:58:19.600 --> 00:58:21.640
I think you can
build organizations

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:26.074
that support it
particularly effectively.

00:58:26.074 --> 00:58:28.140
I think we talk a lot
about some of that

00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:30.465
here in the Valley on
fail-fast and iterate

00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:33.490
and do all those things.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:37.100
The trick in the
sporting world is

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:40.210
your outcomes are very clear.

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:42.031
And that's awesome
in a lot of ways.

00:58:42.031 --> 00:58:42.530
Right?

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:44.738
It would be nice to know at
the end of the day, like,

00:58:44.738 --> 00:58:46.870
did I win or lose?

00:58:46.870 --> 00:58:48.120
I sit and I edit a story.

00:58:48.120 --> 00:58:50.090
Like, am I awesome?

00:58:50.090 --> 00:58:52.520
This seems OK.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.090
But it's also hard,
because you can, I think,

00:58:55.090 --> 00:58:59.675
lose focus on process and
get very outcome-focused.

00:58:59.675 --> 00:59:02.050
So I think that's the tension
that the sports world faces

00:59:02.050 --> 00:59:02.550
on that.

00:59:02.550 --> 00:59:03.466
RACHEL O'MEARA: Great.

00:59:03.466 --> 00:59:06.157
Well, we'll close with that,
with a growth mindset mentality

00:59:06.157 --> 00:59:08.240
and that we all need to
challenge our assumptions.

00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:10.350
So thanks so much for
coming today, Mark.

00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:12.200
MARK MCCLUSKY: Thank you.
