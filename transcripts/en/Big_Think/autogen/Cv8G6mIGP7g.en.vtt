I think this is one of the major

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610
I think this is one of the major
 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.660
I think this is one of the major
unknowns about Obama he in some ways has

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670
unknowns about Obama he in some ways has
 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.340
unknowns about Obama he in some ways has
to succeed within a very traditional

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350

broadcast style of politics and

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:21.109
broadcast style of politics and
 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:27.019
broadcast style of politics and
governance but there's also the outlines

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029
governance but there's also the outlines
 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.980
governance but there's also the outlines
of a new system and I think the new part

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990
of a new system and I think the new part
 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.500
of a new system and I think the new part
is coming from a fact that's actually

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510
is coming from a fact that's actually
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.549
is coming from a fact that's actually
even bigger than Obama and our

00:00:36.549 --> 00:00:36.559
even bigger than Obama and our
 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:39.740
even bigger than Obama and our
preoccupations in electoral politics and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750
preoccupations in electoral politics and
 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.920
preoccupations in electoral politics and
that's that the falling costs for people

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930
that's that the falling costs for people
 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.959
that's that the falling costs for people
with the same interest to share

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
with the same interest to share
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.770
with the same interest to share
information and collaborate and find

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780
information and collaborate and find
 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.830
information and collaborate and find
each other in the first place that is

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840
each other in the first place that is
 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.990
each other in the first place that is
what's changing the world the falling

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
what's changing the world the falling
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
what's changing the world the falling
costs for like-minded people to locate

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410
costs for like-minded people to locate
 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500
costs for like-minded people to locate
each other share information do

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
each other share information do
 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110
each other share information do
something with it and then tell the rest

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120
something with it and then tell the rest
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.230
something with it and then tell the rest
of the world and whether your campaign

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240
of the world and whether your campaign
 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.500
of the world and whether your campaign
recognizes it or not that is out there

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510
recognizes it or not that is out there
 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.080
recognizes it or not that is out there
and it's happening and so there's no

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090
and it's happening and so there's no
 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.080
and it's happening and so there's no
doubt that an American government

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090
doubt that an American government
 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.770
doubt that an American government
realizing this shift could operate in a

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780
realizing this shift could operate in a
 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380
realizing this shift could operate in a
different way than our government does

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390
different way than our government does
 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.590
different way than our government does
now and there are people who want to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600
now and there are people who want to
 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.980
now and there are people who want to
make that transition happen who want to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
make that transition happen who want to
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.880
make that transition happen who want to

see the age not of Internet fundraising
 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.020
see the age not of Internet fundraising
and organizing a campaign over the web

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030
and organizing a campaign over the web
 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.450
and organizing a campaign over the web
but something much more profound which

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
but something much more profound which
 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.429
but something much more profound which
would be government of the people by the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439
would be government of the people by the
 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.230
would be government of the people by the
people and for the people in which the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240
people and for the people in which the
 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.300
people and for the people in which the
people actually have the same

people actually have the same
 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370
people actually have the same
information available to them that the

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380
information available to them that the
 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.270
information available to them that the
government has and that kind of openness

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280
government has and that kind of openness
 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.310
government has and that kind of openness
that kind of transparency is certainly

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
that kind of transparency is certainly
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.179
that kind of transparency is certainly
going to change government eventually

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189
going to change government eventually
 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.760
going to change government eventually
but we really don't know if the election

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770
but we really don't know if the election
 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.620
but we really don't know if the election
of Obama would bring it on we didn't

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630
of Obama would bring it on we didn't
 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.020
of Obama would bring it on we didn't
really don't know at all if he would

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
really don't know at all if he would
 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:12.470
really don't know at all if he would
govern any differently then Bill Clinton

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480
govern any differently then Bill Clinton
 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.980
govern any differently then Bill Clinton
or for that matter Joe

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990
or for that matter Joe
 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.870
or for that matter Joe
it's it's there as a kind of as a kind

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880
it's it's there as a kind of as a kind
 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:26.730
it's it's there as a kind of as a kind
of a undertone and as potential but the

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740
of a undertone and as potential but the
 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.430
of a undertone and as potential but the
rest remains to be seen and we have this

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440
rest remains to be seen and we have this
 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.290
rest remains to be seen and we have this
problem about talking about change when

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300
problem about talking about change when
 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.960
problem about talking about change when
it comes to technology and and these big

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970
it comes to technology and and these big
 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.080
it comes to technology and and these big
shifts is we ask you know whether it's

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090
shifts is we ask you know whether it's
 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.240
shifts is we ask you know whether it's
going to be one or the other we ask it

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250
going to be one or the other we ask it
 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.190
going to be one or the other we ask it
that if it's you know the internet is

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200
that if it's you know the internet is
 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.040
that if it's you know the internet is
taking over or really not much of a

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050
taking over or really not much of a
 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.090
taking over or really not much of a
factor at all

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100
factor at all
 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.280
factor at all
so we have to have some more complex

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290
so we have to have some more complex
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.970
so we have to have some more complex
images here sort of like they're still

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980
images here sort of like they're still
 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.650
images here sort of like they're still
running the old stadium but they're

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660
running the old stadium but they're
 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.720
running the old stadium but they're
building the new one right or you know

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730
building the new one right or you know
 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:57.780
building the new one right or you know
right around it you know we we function

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790
right around it you know we we function
 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.510
right around it you know we we function
in both worlds at the same time the old

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520
in both worlds at the same time the old
 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.180
in both worlds at the same time the old
broadcasting system is still there for

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190
broadcasting system is still there for
 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.470
broadcasting system is still there for
much of the country and much of the

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480
much of the country and much of the
 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.900
much of the country and much of the
campaign is being run through it and

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910
campaign is being run through it and
 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.850
campaign is being run through it and
that underneath and around it there's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860
that underneath and around it there's
 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.729
that underneath and around it there's
this new distributed system of sort of

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739
this new distributed system of sort of
 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.370
this new distributed system of sort of
many-to-many politics and media and it

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380
many-to-many politics and media and it
 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.160
many-to-many politics and media and it
the to interact with each other so I

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170
the to interact with each other so I
 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.160
the to interact with each other so I
think we're gonna continue to see that

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170
 
 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.230
 
you
