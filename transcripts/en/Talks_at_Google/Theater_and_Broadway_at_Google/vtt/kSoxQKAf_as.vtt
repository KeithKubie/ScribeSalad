SPEAKER 1: Please give a
warm welcome to our guests

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.400
from "Hamilton."

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.356
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.356 --> 00:00:12.334
INTERVIEWER: Thank you.

00:00:15.268 --> 00:00:16.735
Come on up.

00:00:16.735 --> 00:00:19.658
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:19.658 --> 00:00:20.158
Thank you.

00:00:20.158 --> 00:00:22.114
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:28.471
Wow.

00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:31.090
It's standing room
only, this is crazy.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.764
Everybody has been super excited
about having you guys here.

00:00:34.764 --> 00:00:37.180
We bring in a lot of Broadway
shows into the Talks program

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.971
here in the office.

00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:40.810
And everyone always asks me,
when are you doing "Hamilton?"

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.310
When are you bringing
in "Hamilton?"

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:43.882
And now finally,
today is the day.

00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:45.340
Thank you all for
being here again.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.573
LEXI LAWSON: Yay!

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:45.807
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Thanks for having us.

00:00:45.807 --> 00:00:46.274
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Thank you very much.

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:46.741
Thank you.

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:47.240
Thank you.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.130
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.369
INTERVIEWER: So let's
just kick it off.

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.410
Let's go down the line
and start with James here.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.120
Tell us who you are and
what do you do in the show?

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.203
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: I
am James Monroe Iglehart,

00:00:57.203 --> 00:00:59.515
and I play Marquis de
Lafayette and Thomas Jefferson.

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:01.990
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.720
LEXI LAWSON: Hi,
I'm Lexi Lawson,

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.167
I play Elizabeth Hamilton.

00:01:05.167 --> 00:01:06.412
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:06.412 --> 00:01:08.370
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Hi,
I'm Anthony Lee Medina,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.596
and I play John Laurens
and Philip Hamilton.

00:01:10.596 --> 00:01:12.380
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.080
JOANNA JONES: Hi,
I'm Joanna Jones,

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.090
and I play Peggy Schuyler
and Maria Reynolds.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.027
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:18.027 --> 00:01:19.860
INTERVIEWER: Hi, I'm--
no, I'm just kidding.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:23.660
I just got to ask real quick,
just to warm this up here,

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.790
how much of American
history did you

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.080
all actually know before
getting into the show?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.310
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Ooh!

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.083
LEXI LAWSON: Ooh!

00:01:30.083 --> 00:01:30.496
JOANNA JONES: Oh no.

00:01:30.496 --> 00:01:32.037
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Well, speaking

00:01:32.037 --> 00:01:35.030
from a kid who graduated in
1992 in the wonderful American

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.474
school system--

00:01:36.474 --> 00:01:37.318
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:37.318 --> 00:01:40.940
--I knew that George Washington
might have chopped down

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:41.570
a cherry tree.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.680
I knew that Martin
Luther King had a dream.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.132
And then they let us go.

00:01:47.132 --> 00:01:50.090
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.340
I mean, we knew
some of what it was.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.310
But when you get into
something like this,

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.980
you start learning the
crust of a brother.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.732
And so we learn the
crust of some of the guys

00:02:00.732 --> 00:02:02.190
who helped make
this country great.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.750
So we knew the overview
hero look of our country.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.680
Like, ah, Thomas
Jefferson, third president,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.610
Louisiana Purchase.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.067
But we never knew cool things,
like him and Sally, his beef

00:02:14.067 --> 00:02:15.400
with Hamilton, things like that.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.480
So when you got into this
show, or even learned

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.330
about this show, it
made you just want

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.950
to go read about other people.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.030
It made you want to read
about Andrew Jackson,

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.150
and him just shooting people
just because he felt like it.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.930
It made you want to go
read about other folks that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.580
made our country
what it is and just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.159
learn that they were
real people too,

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:34.450
at least from my point of view.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.570
LEXI LAWSON: Well said.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:36.390
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Thank you.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.015
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
I'm About the same.

00:02:38.015 --> 00:02:40.970
I mean, like I remember
US history was a class.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.900
I took it.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.710
But it kind of disappeared
after high school.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.660
And then it came back
when the show came.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.719
I started having to
figure out what happened,

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.510
and why we're here.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.790
And I'm still learning things.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.530
Every day, I'm like, wait,
what did he just say?

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.920
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yes.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.040
LEXI LAWSON: Right.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.665
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:02:55.665 --> 00:02:57.950
INTERVIEWER: Personally, I
knew I knew about Aaron Burr

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:58.960
only from the milk commercial.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.080
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yes!

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.820
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
There was a commercial?

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.570
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.762
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh, I
did not remember this, no.

00:03:03.762 --> 00:03:05.262
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Oh, you're

00:03:05.262 --> 00:03:07.470
going to find out that some
of the people in our cast

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.894
are a little bit
younger than me.

00:03:10.894 --> 00:03:12.185
So there was a milk commercial.

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:13.268
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Right.

00:03:13.268 --> 00:03:15.704
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:17.120
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: And the guy

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.661
had his mouth full
of cookies, and he

00:03:18.661 --> 00:03:20.390
was supposed to
answer a question, who

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.089
shot Alexander Hamilton?

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:23.505
And he goes,
(MUFFLED) Aaron Burr!

00:03:23.505 --> 00:03:24.980
And the guy goes, oh, I'm
sorry, I can't understand you.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.880
(MUFFLED) Aaron Burr.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.270
And that was the joke, because
none of us knew who he was.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:30.640
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.140
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Leslie redid
that commercial, didn't he?

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.032
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Yes, he did the--

00:03:34.032 --> 00:03:34.856
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:35.740
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
That I've seen.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.560
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
He did the remake

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.565
of the original commercial.

00:03:37.565 --> 00:03:39.080
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: OK well, I
didn't know that was a thing.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.010
I'm 28.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.090
28, OK?

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.899
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Ugh.

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:45.690
We tease each other
like that all the time.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:46.495
INTERVIEWER: If those of you
in the room who don't know,

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:47.202
there you go.

00:03:47.202 --> 00:03:48.467
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:48.467 --> 00:03:50.800
So how did each of you get
connected to this production,

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.590
to "Hamilton", in
the first place?

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.256
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Go ahead, Joanna.

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:55.970
JOANNA JONES: Well,
I had the opportunity

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.940
to see the show a
couple of years ago.

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.870
I didn't know a whole
lot about it at all.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.939
And I was living in LA, and
I was in New York auditioning

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:04.730
for something else.

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.830
And I've known Leslie
for several years.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.510
And I was like, hey, I'm
staying across from your show.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.080
And he's like, OK, here's
some standing room tickets.

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.630
And I just walked in with no
idea what was about to happen

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.079
and just experienced
the whole thing.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:19.410
And my mouth was just
agape the whole time.

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.440
And I was weeping through the
last 20 minutes of the show.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.380
And so that was first
sort of introduction--

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.240
INTERVIEWER: Was that on
Broadway, or at the Public?

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.410
JOANNA JONES: On Broadway.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.160
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.180
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.190
I'm actually really
new to the show.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.150
I've only been on for
about 3 and 1/2 weeks.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.320
LEXI LAWSON: And killing it.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:34.010
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Every night.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.212
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Every scene.

00:04:34.212 --> 00:04:34.850
LEXI LAWSON: Oh, she's great.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:35.810
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
She's amazing.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.100
INTERVIEWER: I saw it
like, three weeks ago.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:38.400
It must been like your
second day or something.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:39.608
JOANNA JONES: Probably, yeah.

00:04:39.608 --> 00:04:40.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:41.660
INTERVIEWER: It was wonderful.

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.790
So I guess the rest
of you, real quick,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.530
how did you get connected?

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.840
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I
started going in for it

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.030
when it was the Mixtape,
before the Public,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.050
and then at the Public.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.870
And the only thing we had
got was like "My Shot."

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.927
So we had that, "I
imagine that so much it

00:04:56.927 --> 00:04:58.010
feels more like a memory."

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:00.600
And everyone just did
that rap for them.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.760
And then I didn't
know what it was.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:03.720
And then it was
transferring to Broadway,

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.490
and everyone was
like, there's a guy

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.740
that looks like you who
has the same name as you,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.156
and you're going
to play his part.

00:05:08.156 --> 00:05:08.860
I was like, OK.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:09.360
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.640
And then I spent an obscene
amount of money on a ticket.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.500
It was like right
after they opened.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.119
And I had like, four
cocktails before it started,

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:19.910
and I had no idea what
was going to happen.

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.230
And then I just wept
for 2 and 1/2 hours.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.400
And then I was like, this is
going to be my Broadway debut.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.950
And cut to like a year and a
half later, and here we are.

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:28.340
INTERVIEWER: Wow.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.960
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.251
INTERVIEWER: That's incredible.

00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:32.960
And then what about
the two of you?

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:34.285
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Loaded.

00:05:34.285 --> 00:05:35.220
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah, I know.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.720
No.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.560
My story is so long.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.630
So I'm trying to
condense it all.

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.990
I saw this show right when
it opened on Broadway.

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.460
My friend Morgan Marcell
was one of the dancers in it

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:46.740
at the time.

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:51.860
And I also knew
Lin from "Heights."

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.660
And so when I saw it,
it was standing room.

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:54.680
It was sold out.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.500
At this time, standing
room was even hard to get.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.160
And my friend and I saw it.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.050
I was living in LA at the time.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.890
And I was like, oh my goodness,
I need to do this show!

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:09.590
And I'd stopped doing
theater, because I suffered

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.130
for a long time from anxieties,
like severe anxieties on stage.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.470
After doing theater my
whole life, all of a sudden,

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:17.776
I got anxieties in 2011.

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:19.150
And so I stopped
and moved to LA.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.160
And when I saw the show, I was
like, I have to do the show.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.159
I have to figure it out.

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:23.140
I have to face my fear.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.360
So I started
preparing for the show

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.170
before I even had an audition,
about six months before I even

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:30.130
got the call.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.540
I put myself on
tape just in case

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.090
they weren't going to see me.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:35.620
And it went from there.

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:37.132
I felt so connected to the show.

00:06:37.132 --> 00:06:37.840
INTERVIEWER: Wow.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.590
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.590
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Mine's a little long too,

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:42.010
but I'll try to keep it short.

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:45.312
I've known the guys who created
the show for many years.

00:06:45.312 --> 00:06:47.020
I'm part of a group
called Freestyle Love

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.520
Supreme with Lin, Chris
Jackson, Daveed Diggs

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:50.800
and a couple other brothers.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.750
It's an improv hip-hop group.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.880
And when Lin was
creating the show,

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.800
he did this concert
at Lincoln Center.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.924
And he asked me to
be Lawrence Mulligan.

00:06:58.924 --> 00:07:01.090
So the first guy to do
Lawrence Mulligan in public--

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.110
I mean, Lawrence Mulligan-- uh--

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.114
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I was
like, who is he talking about?

00:07:03.114 --> 00:07:04.322
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Sorry.

00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:06.880
The first to do Hercules
Mulligan was me.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.500
And it was me, Mandy, Chris
Jackson, Utkarsh, all the guys

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.720
that Lin has around him.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.780
And we did the show.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.090
And I was like, oh,
this is really cool.

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.380
But then "Aladdin" happened.

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.120
So I was like, great.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.510
OK, cool.

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:20.970
"Hamilton's" "Hamilton,"
I'm in "Aladdin," great.

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.660
Then all of a sudden, while
I was in my third year,

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:25.035
they were like, hey, you want
to come back to the family?

00:07:25.035 --> 00:07:26.120
And I was like, really?

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.220
Sure!

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.680
That sounds like fun.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.190
And so that's how
I got back in it.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.420
But I've been around
it for a long time.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.650
INTERVIEWER: I imagine
you actually saying it

00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:33.870
like that on the phone.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.585
Sounds like fun!

00:07:34.585 --> 00:07:35.085
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:35.085 --> 00:07:35.570
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
No seriously--

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:36.699
That's what's really funny.

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:38.240
Because I didn't
take them seriously.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.720
They're like, you want
to be a part of the show?

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.680
I was like, yeah, sure.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:41.545
You don't mean that.

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:42.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:42.321 --> 00:07:43.570
INTERVIEWER: And here you are.

00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:45.892
So you're probably, I guess,
from the Broadway world,

00:07:45.892 --> 00:07:47.350
a little more well
known originally

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:49.360
for originating Genie, right?

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:49.540
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yeah.

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.664
INTERVIEWER: So did you
bring any of Genie with you

00:07:51.664 --> 00:07:53.130
to do these tracks now?

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:55.960
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: What's
really funny is I guess I did.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.130
But it's not Genie that
I'm bringing with me,

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.440
I'm like this all the time.

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:00.640
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:01.390
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:08.710
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: So that
silliness and that I'm kind

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.720
of just-- as my friends
like to call me--

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.880
being a friend with me
is like being a friend

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.170
with a person who's in 3D.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.950
I'm that big all the time.

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:18.190
So I kind of just brought
that with me to "Hamilton."

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:19.280
And I was hoping it would work.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.130
Because everybody in
"Hamilton" is so cool.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.102
LEXI LAWSON: Thank you!

00:08:22.102 --> 00:08:22.770
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
The original cast,

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:24.490
and even this cast,
everybody is so cool.

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:27.630
And I am like, just the biggest
Toys R Us kid in the world.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:28.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:28.210
LEXI LAWSON: He is.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:30.140
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: So I
was like, I hope this works.

00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.723
And so far, nobody's thrown an
apple at me while I'm on stage.

00:08:32.723 --> 00:08:33.623
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:33.623 --> 00:08:35.539
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I
thought it was wonderful.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:38.080
And actually, I saw all of you,
like I said, a couple of weeks

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:38.580
ago.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.009
But I had the pleasure too
of seeing the original cast

00:08:41.009 --> 00:08:42.925
years ago before the
soundtrack was out, even.

00:08:42.925 --> 00:08:46.299
And I remember I turned to my
wife, and I said, this is--

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:47.590
I knew nothing about it, right?

00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:50.048
And I turned my wife and I
said, this is changing Broadway.

00:08:50.048 --> 00:08:52.620
This is going to redefine
everything that we know.

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:54.670
And so the roles became iconic.

00:08:54.670 --> 00:08:55.930
The show has become iconic.

00:08:55.930 --> 00:08:59.150
What was it like for all of you
to step into these roles that

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:01.600
were already so well known?

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:05.090
LEXI LAWSON: I have to say, for
me, it was fairly challenging.

00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:08.310
I was the first replacement
for one of the leads.

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.560
I replaced Phillipa Soo, who
was fantastic in the show.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:15.490
And so I jumped into the
show when it was still--

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.350
it was right after the Tony's.

00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.590
And so there was so
much hype and so much

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.580
pressure that I felt to have
to take over for this role.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:29.400
And I was graced by our
wonderful creative team, Tommy

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:34.240
Kail, Alex Lacamoire, who gave
us the ability to find the show

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:37.060
and find the roles ourselves,
and that, we didn't necessarily

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.730
have to replicate or
duplicate their character,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.100
but bring what we know, for me
as Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton,

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.300
to life.

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:53.299
So that was really easing for
myself to be able to do that.

00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:54.340
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.570
LEXI LAWSON: But we're all like
one big happy family backstage.

00:09:56.570 --> 00:09:57.160
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yeah.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.080
LEXI LAWSON: So like the
hype is out in front of us,

00:09:59.080 --> 00:09:59.621
the audience.

00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:01.590
But when we're backstage,
we're all goofballs.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.240
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Completely.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.940
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Follow an Instagram story,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.840
and you'll see
some weird things.

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:05.590
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.312
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:08.312 --> 00:10:10.930
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah, it
was kind of the same situation,

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:12.305
I think, for all
of us, probably.

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:14.905
They were very insistent
that we are not

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:18.250
the people we were replacing,
and that they wanted us to find

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:20.134
the roles within ourselves.

00:10:20.134 --> 00:10:21.550
Yeah, I think my
first day, he was

00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:23.380
like you're not Anthony Ramos,
you're not Jordan Fisher.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.420
Don't be those people.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:25.870
It was like, OK, cool.

00:10:25.870 --> 00:10:27.100
I'll do a me version.

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.340
JOANNA JONES: It's a very
nurturing, supportive

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:28.620
environment

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:29.620
LEXI LAWSON: And you do it well.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.953
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Thanks, mom.

00:10:30.953 --> 00:10:33.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.270
JOANNA JONES: Yeah, again,
I'm pretty new to the show.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:39.670
But I would just say
that it was welcoming,

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:42.280
and a nurturing sort of
directing environment

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.010
from day one.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:46.090
So I really felt supported
and able to sort of ease

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:49.495
my way in, and just bring myself
to it as much as possible.

00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.792
And yeah, it's really wonderful.

00:10:51.792 --> 00:10:55.300
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, James
do they ever tell you--

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:57.530
you said, you're just
like this normally, right?

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:58.791

00:10:58.791 --> 00:11:00.166

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:00.970
LEXI LAWSON: It's true.

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:01.420

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.000
INTERVIEWER: Do they ever tell
you like, too much, bring it

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:04.180
back?

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:05.680
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
No, actually.

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.460
The fun part is--

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.680
I remember actually having
a very long conversation

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:09.670
with Daveed.

00:11:09.670 --> 00:11:13.617
And Daveed said, no man, look,
bring your swagger to the show.

00:11:13.617 --> 00:11:14.825
And I was like, are you sure?

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:21.090
He said, no, man, bring
what you do to the show.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.450
And the one cool thing, I
do have a degree in acting.

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.400
So I know when not
to be an idiot.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.810
So the first act, I am
the Marquis de Lafayette.

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.270
I am 19-year-old
Frenchman who comes here.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:33.900
I do that.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:35.460
And then I go on to
Thomas Jefferson.

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:40.530
And that's when I become the
absolute just purple craziness

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:42.550
that gets to go on stage.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:45.840
It's so fun just to
bring that to the stage.

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.610
The one thing they
allowed me to do was--

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:49.090
I'm surrounded by tenors.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:50.450
Almost everybody is a tenor.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:53.430
And so I'm a baritone-- so I
was able to bring my baritone

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:54.160
voice to it.

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.660
And I think that's
one of the things

00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:57.090
that the fans
noticed, was that--

00:11:57.090 --> 00:11:59.400
oh, Jesus Christ, there's
a guy is talking real low,

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.890
and I have a whole
different base to my voice

00:12:01.890 --> 00:12:04.120
when I play Jefferson
against Hamilton.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:05.190
So they liked it.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:05.810
It's cool.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:07.455
So they never told
me to tone it down.

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:09.330
They actually said, no,
no, come up, come up.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.410
I was like, but
this is "Hamilton."

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:11.130
No, no, no, come on.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:11.460
Bring it.

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:11.790
Bring it.

00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:12.290
Bring it.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:13.369
And I was like, OK, fine!

00:12:13.369 --> 00:12:14.160
And so here we are.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.315
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:16.315 --> 00:12:17.920
INTERVIEWER: That's awesome.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.960
Lexi, you mentioned that
the show called to you.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.330
Did this role
specifically speak to you?

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:26.124
When you put yourself
on tape ahead of time

00:12:26.124 --> 00:12:27.540
before your audition,
did you know

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.748
this is who you wanted to be?

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:30.380
LEXI LAWSON: No, You know, no.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.740
So I always play the sassy
kind of girl in all plays.

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:38.850
So I was thinking it was
going to be Angelica.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.340
Because I resonated--
not that I resonated,

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.800
but it was easy for me to do.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.370
Looking back, though,
when I did see the show,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:50.160
"Helpless," and "Who Lives, Who
Dies, Who Tells Your Story?"

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:57.920
were the ones that
stuck with me.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:01.970
When you are aligned with
something, it opens you up,

00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:03.720
and those two songs did.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:08.180
And so the reason why I
didn't necessarily associate

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:11.480
with Elizabeth Hamilton was
because I was fearful of it.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.790
I was fearful that I wasn't
good enough to do the role.

00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:18.047
And so that's why I
didn't think that role

00:13:18.047 --> 00:13:19.130
was going to come with me.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.588
And even when I
got the call that I

00:13:20.588 --> 00:13:22.730
was going to play Elizabeth
Hamilton on Broadway,

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:23.934
I was like, aah.

00:13:23.934 --> 00:13:25.225
And then I was like, oh my god!

00:13:25.225 --> 00:13:26.420
I can't sing those notes!

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.740
I can't do that!

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.320
And I started talking
myself out of it, which

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:31.850
is a good lesson to learn.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:36.050
Because come a year, nearly
a year and a half later,

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:37.587
and I could do it in my sleep.

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:39.920
And that goes to show your
growth, and how you can grow.

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.220
Even if you don't think you can
grow, you can grow, you know?

00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:47.835
So now-- yes, I can't imagine
being any other role right now.

00:13:47.835 --> 00:13:49.515
INTERVIEWER: What is
the Eliza project?

00:13:49.515 --> 00:13:50.499
How'd you get involved?

00:13:50.499 --> 00:13:52.040
LEXI LAWSON: I got
involved with that

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.360
because Phillipa Soo and Morgan
Marcell started this project.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.320
What we do is that we go into
Graham Windham, the orphanage

00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:02.060
that Elizabeth Hamilton started.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:06.650
And we take a group of kids that
excel in their academics that

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.830
are interested in the arts.

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:12.440
We take about 17 to 20
of them, and we put them

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.250
in environments that
can inspire them.

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:18.896
So this year, I created--

00:14:18.896 --> 00:14:20.750
not that I created,
I didn't create it.

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:25.739
I facilitated doing a workshop
in the same recording studio

00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:28.030
that Cindy Lauper, and Bon
Jovi, and some really greats

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:28.550
recorded in.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:33.380
So they had the experience to
come in with Anthony and Q.

00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.580
And they taught them how
to write, and rap, and sing

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.120
a song.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:40.310
And when I tell you this
song could be on the radio,

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.950
it really could.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:41.490
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
It's really great.

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:42.740
LEXI LAWSON: They are amazing.

00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.250
They did it all on their own.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:49.017
We also did a
project with dance.

00:14:49.017 --> 00:14:50.600
We had one of our
Broadway performers,

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.330
Lauren, come in and
teach them that.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:57.320
Our third week, we had a cooking
class with two of our people

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.450
on Broadway as well,
along with teaching them

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:04.880
how to write a movie script,
in the movie writing room.

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.310
And then we put on a performance
for all their friends

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.660
and their families to come see.

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.810
And this year, it was a packed
house, which was so inspiring.

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:14.386
I mean, I don't know where
any of you come from,

00:15:14.386 --> 00:15:16.010
but we all have our
own stories, right?

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:18.270
We all want to share
and tell our stories.

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:22.460
But what inspired me with
these children is that--

00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:26.360
for instance, one girl
did not want to speak,

00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.570
because she just wanted
her mother to be around.

00:15:29.570 --> 00:15:34.730
And when she saw her mom walk
in, her whole aura changed.

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:38.450
She cried, and she got up on
stage, and she started rapping.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:41.210
And she was inspired
that her mom was there.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.790
And for me, I was always
supported by my mother,

00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:47.840
so I don't know how that
feels to long for your mother.

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.749
And that inspired me.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.790
And so let me get back to
what Graham Windham is.

00:15:51.790 --> 00:15:56.540
It's a place where children
go when they're not really

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:59.280
gelling at home, whether
it's with their family,

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.860
or whether they're misbehaving.

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:05.450
It's a place for them to
get some extra nourishment,

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:06.380
let's say.

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.980
And so it really
inspired me, this one.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:11.470
So yes, that's
the Eliza Project.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:14.326
If you want to know about
it, go to grahamwindham.org,

00:16:14.326 --> 00:16:15.860
or go to the Eliza Project.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:16.850
Google Eliza Project.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:18.440
Google Eliza Project.

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.925
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:21.562
And you can read more about it.

00:16:21.562 --> 00:16:23.020
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Nicely done.

00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:23.490
LEXI LAWSON: Thank you.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:25.185
INTERVIEWER: Happy you
didn't say Bing, we're--

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:25.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.390
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Got to Bing.

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:28.015
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Is that a thing?

00:16:28.015 --> 00:16:30.470
INTERVIEWER: That's
what I said--

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:36.230
Joanna, you were recently
in NBC's "Hairspray Live,"

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:39.140
the first in their
series of these

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.940
live theater performances that
actually had a live audience.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.700
Was that experience
weird for you?

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:48.799
It seems to me like it's
a staged studio audience.

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:49.590
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:50.720
INTERVIEWER: How was
that experience to you

00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.490
compared to the live
theater experience?

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:56.584
JOANNA JONES: It's funny,
because in theater, you're

00:16:56.584 --> 00:16:58.500
trying not to break the
fourth wall and stuff.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.612
But with everyone
just watching you,

00:17:00.612 --> 00:17:02.570
they're taking your
commercial breaks with you,

00:17:02.570 --> 00:17:05.460
and they're seeing you stop the
dance and be like, oh my god,

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.290
that was so hard.

00:17:06.290 --> 00:17:08.390
They see all the behind
the scenes stuff.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.160
And also, their
reactions are kind of

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.780
influenced by their hype man,
who was like, clap really loud

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:13.920
right now, and stuff like that.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:14.329
INTERVIEWER: Oh really?

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.625
JOANNA JONES: So yeah,
but it was exhilarating.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:17.300
It was cool.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.800
It was like they were a part of
the show that we were creating.

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.569
And I don't know,
it was really fun.

00:17:22.569 --> 00:17:24.152
INTERVIEWER: Yeah,
that's interesting.

00:17:24.152 --> 00:17:27.410
I always watch these, and
I think it's weird to me

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:29.670
because the timing is different.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:31.910
Because you can't wait for
laughter, because you're

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:33.160
not hearing the laughter.

00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:34.400
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.982
INTERVIEWER: So
props to you, yeah.

00:17:35.982 --> 00:17:36.773
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:17:36.773 --> 00:17:38.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:40.160
INTERVIEWER: I want to
kind of switch gears

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.460
a little bit to talk about
the subject of the show,

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:46.160
or I guess, the genre
of the show is kind of--

00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:49.220
it is unique and
previously undefined.

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.720
And it's knocked
down walls, and you

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.470
could say we've raised
the bar of theater,

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:54.140
or changed the bar
of theater, whatever

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:55.370
you want to say about it.

00:17:55.370 --> 00:17:58.580
And the show is basically
an overnight smash hit,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:01.310
hit the ground running,
hasn't stopped since.

00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:04.370
I mean, what kind of barriers
for you all, personally,

00:18:04.370 --> 00:18:06.950
has it affected any
barriers that you previously

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:07.522
encountered?

00:18:07.522 --> 00:18:08.980
Or how has it
changed your careers?

00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:12.020
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I mean,
before this, I was mostly seen

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:15.560
as children, which is normal.

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.990
But then, it's like--

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:18.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.800
I'm still doing it.

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:23.370
But like, I have
played drug dealers,

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:25.640
and just straight off the
boat Latin American kids.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.020
And I'm like, I'm--

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:27.650
[THUMPING]

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:28.710
--ooh, that's a mic.

00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:30.501
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
That's a microphone.

00:18:30.501 --> 00:18:32.500
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I
was born in New York,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.745
I am Puerto Rican and Cuban.

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:35.870
I, of course, resonate with
Latin American culture.

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:37.190
That is who I am.

00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:40.790
But I shouldn't be boxed into
this world where I can only

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:42.950
play things that are
straight off the boat,

00:18:42.950 --> 00:18:44.910
or like some sort of
horrible stereotype.

00:18:44.910 --> 00:18:46.910
This show is the first
time I got to see people,

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.790
not only playing characters that
were out of the norm of what we

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.010
get to play, but also
taking on characters that

00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:55.030
aren't necessarily the race
that-- like Philip and John

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.906
Laurens are not
Puerto Rican-Cuban.

00:18:56.906 --> 00:18:58.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:58.650 --> 00:18:59.270
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Although, you couldn't tell that

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.210
to a high school now.

00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:00.560
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: No.

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:01.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:02.650
But that's the
most amazing thing.

00:19:02.650 --> 00:19:05.120
I think that's the most
beautiful thing, is that--

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:08.840
I don't know, for me, growing
up, I didn't see a lot of me

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.110
on television or on stage.

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:14.000
It was a lot of these
very specific beautiful,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.217
blond, tall girls, and
these Caucasian men

00:19:16.217 --> 00:19:17.300
that looked a certain way.

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.832
And the roles weren't
in existence for me.

00:19:19.832 --> 00:19:22.040
It didn't seem like there
was a possibility for that.

00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.947
And it's so amazing
now to, after the show,

00:19:24.947 --> 00:19:26.780
see all these kids come
on stage afterwards,

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.679
and to honestly be
like, I want to do this.

00:19:29.679 --> 00:19:31.220
And they see it as
a possibility now.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:32.840
And then on top of
that, also, they

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:36.050
see that, not only on a
performance side that you

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:40.120
can be anything and still
be a performer, but also

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.200
we're telling the story
of our forefathers

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.720
and that now they can
see that there is--

00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.240
I mean, we had Barack Obama.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.740
Praise.

00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:52.100
But they're seeing now
that this story of America

00:19:52.100 --> 00:19:54.410
is being told by
people of color,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.430
and that they can be a part
of the story of America,

00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:01.340
and they can go into
politics, and be elected,

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:02.310
and it is possible.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:05.670
And I think that's the most
amazing turn around in my head,

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:07.650
and I think worldwide.

00:20:07.650 --> 00:20:08.672
I don't know.

00:20:08.672 --> 00:20:09.630
Country-wide, at least.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.796
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: I
also think that this show--

00:20:11.796 --> 00:20:15.180
I've been blessed
for casting directors

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.270
and for shows to see me as not
just an African American man.

00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:21.130
So this show didn't
do that for me.

00:20:21.130 --> 00:20:24.720
But what I enjoyed that the show
did was this show seemed-- no,

00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:25.740
not seemed, it did--

00:20:25.740 --> 00:20:27.820
opened the mind of the
theater-going audience.

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:28.695
JOANNA JONES: Mm-hmm.

00:20:28.695 --> 00:20:28.965
Oh yeah.

00:20:28.965 --> 00:20:30.660
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: So
the theater-going audience

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.240
would go to a show and go,
oh, I know what this is about.

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.890
You're going to play this.

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:38.510
And now they see this, and
they're going, oh my god.

00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:39.910
It was amazing.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:42.060
It was like someone
had taken the box

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.590
and just pulled the walls off.

00:20:43.590 --> 00:20:46.440
And everybody went, oh, you mean
everybody can play everybody?

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.610
You're like, yeah, everybody
can play everybody.

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:50.766
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:54.950
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.450
And I think it kind of put the
audience on a level playing

00:20:59.450 --> 00:21:00.530
ground.

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.270
I think all of us
can attest, there's

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.728
that moment where you look out
into the audience when we're

00:21:04.728 --> 00:21:07.910
doing a song, and
you see the people

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.230
that look like they
would enjoy "Hamilton,"

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.220
that wonderful family of
color, whoever they are,

00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.350
that looks like they
could enjoy "Hamilton."

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.680
And then there's the
Beaver Cleaver family

00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.390
sitting right next to them.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.069
And the wife is literally
like, (SINGING) I

00:21:23.069 --> 00:21:24.110
am not throwing away my--

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:25.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.230
And you're like, where
did June Cleaver get

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:29.480
the ah, the two, and the four?

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:30.438
And they're just on it.

00:21:30.438 --> 00:21:32.939
And you're like, holy
crap, this is for real.

00:21:32.939 --> 00:21:34.230
JOANNA JONES: Oh, [? my god. ?]

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:35.646
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: And I think

00:21:35.646 --> 00:21:39.890
that's amazing to see that
group of people all of a sudden

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:42.489
not realize they're
listening to hip-hop.

00:21:42.489 --> 00:21:43.280
INTERVIEWER: Right.

00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:44.030 --> 00:21:45.489
Like, their child's
music comes on.

00:21:45.489 --> 00:21:47.654
All of a sudden, they're
like, I get that reference.

00:21:47.654 --> 00:21:49.130
If you don't know, now you know.

00:21:49.130 --> 00:21:49.700
You're like--

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:50.894
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.894 --> 00:21:52.310
They heard it in
"Hamilton" first,

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:54.768
and now, all of the sudden,
they know who Biggie Smalls is.

00:21:54.768 --> 00:21:57.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:57.140 --> 00:21:59.780
The show literally,
within a couple of years,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:02.600
broke this barrier down, where
everybody who came to Broadway

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.060
went, oh, I get it.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.110
I get it now.

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.120
And it's just permeating
through the nation.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.880
And it's really,
really fun to see.

00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.230
Because all of a sudden--

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:14.910
I mean, shows have had
diversity for years.

00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.600
But I think it took
this show, the way

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.490
it was put together,
the way it was written,

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.070
the way it was cast-- sometimes
you just catch lightning

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.970
in a bottle.

00:22:22.970 --> 00:22:25.280
And you can beat someone
over the head with the,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.026
you need to be diverse,
you need to have diversity.

00:22:28.026 --> 00:22:29.900
You need to beat them,
but they don't get it.

00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:32.060
And then, something just
seeps in real smooth.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.600
And they go, (GASPING) I get it.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.830
Sometimes you just don't
need to hammer somebody

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:37.714
with a definition.

00:22:37.714 --> 00:22:39.380
You just need to show
them a good story,

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.588
and just put people up there.

00:22:40.588 --> 00:22:41.810
And then they go, bam.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.976
So I think that's one of
those things this show did.

00:22:43.976 --> 00:22:44.845
JOANNA JONES: Yeah.

00:22:44.845 --> 00:22:48.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:50.155 --> 00:22:51.280
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Thanks.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:52.830
LEXI LAWSON: Thanks.

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:54.413
INTERVIEWER: You got
something to add?

00:22:54.413 --> 00:22:55.224
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:55.224 --> 00:22:56.265
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:22:56.265 --> 00:22:58.073
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you, thank you.

00:22:58.073 --> 00:22:58.355
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Thank you.

00:22:58.355 --> 00:22:58.546
Thank you.

00:22:58.546 --> 00:23:00.129
INTERVIEWER: Thank
you, and that's it.

00:23:00.129 --> 00:23:02.360
Good night.

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.430
Yeah, that's really interesting.

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:06.880
I love the juxtaposition,
like you were talking about,

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.420
the Beaver Cleaver family,
and your stereotypical--

00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.420
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Your hip-hop [? dudes. ?]

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:13.640
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, your
hip-hop dudes, right.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.449
In terms of the age
difference, do you guys

00:23:15.449 --> 00:23:17.740
notice any difference in the
audience feedback you get,

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.156
like from the high
school kids who

00:23:19.156 --> 00:23:20.440
come versus like your elderly?

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.981
LEXI LAWSON: I mean,
for some people,

00:23:21.981 --> 00:23:23.315
they bring their four-year-olds.

00:23:23.315 --> 00:23:24.939
And the four-year-old
is rapping along.

00:23:24.939 --> 00:23:25.660
I'm like, ooh!

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.205
And then you see-- what
really gets me-- oh,

00:23:28.205 --> 00:23:34.576
it gets me every time is
during "Yorktown," at the end--

00:23:34.576 --> 00:23:36.450
what's the last line
that we sing at the end?

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:36.926
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Down!

00:23:36.926 --> 00:23:37.283
LEXI LAWSON: Down!

00:23:37.283 --> 00:23:38.449
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yeah.

00:23:38.449 --> 00:23:39.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.685
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yorktown!

00:23:39.685 --> 00:23:40.860
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: The
world turned upside down.

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:41.420
LEXI LAWSON: The
world turned upside--

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.003
it's one time, at
least, for me, where

00:23:43.003 --> 00:23:44.400
I can see the full audience.

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:45.441
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:23:45.441 --> 00:23:49.130
LEXI LAWSON: And to see the
80-year-old woman and man

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:49.850
just--

00:23:49.850 --> 00:23:51.290
ah, ah!

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:54.380
And I mean, it just-- sorry,
I keep slapping my mic--

00:23:54.380 --> 00:23:57.650
but it just touches me, it
inspires me to see their face

00:23:57.650 --> 00:23:58.820
light up like that.

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.129
I've never seen anything
like that before.

00:24:01.129 --> 00:24:03.170
And then to see the
four-year-old doing the same,

00:24:03.170 --> 00:24:05.407
it is so interesting,
and it is so beautiful.

00:24:05.407 --> 00:24:06.990
And so that always
gets me every time.

00:24:06.990 --> 00:24:09.531
I always go to Mandy and say,
do you see that guy, fourth row

00:24:09.531 --> 00:24:10.460
mezzanine on the left?

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:12.017
I was like, he was so happy!

00:24:12.017 --> 00:24:14.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.360
So yeah.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:15.800
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: We won.

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.200
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: We won.

00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.120
INTERVIEWER: Spoiler, we won.

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:20.960
And he dies.

00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.106
Oh.

00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:24.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.340
(MUFFLED) Aaron Burr.

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:26.792
I keep going back to that.

00:24:26.792 --> 00:24:28.853
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:28.853 --> 00:24:30.680
I'm sorry, I'm in my
own mind right now.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:32.430
[? JOANNA JONES: ?]
That's OK, we are too.

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:33.307
INTERVIEWER: Good.

00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:35.390
Is there any particular
piece of audience feedback

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.180
that resonates, that has
stuck with you that any of you

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:42.965
have been told at the stage door
or through this social media?

00:24:42.965 --> 00:24:45.090
Because you guys are so
interactive with your fans.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:45.839
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:24:45.839 --> 00:24:47.600
We get it from A
to Z, I would say.

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:47.910
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Yeah, there's

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:48.780
little bit of everything.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.750
I mean, I think the most
amazing feedback we actually get

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:51.230
is probably--

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:51.920
I don't know if--
you haven't done

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:53.120
one of these yet, the EduHams.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:53.460
JOANNA JONES: No.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:54.626
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yeah.

00:24:54.626 --> 00:24:57.250
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: That
show is like a rock concert.

00:24:57.250 --> 00:24:58.250
There's nothing like it.

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:01.170
We walk out, and you hear
bum, bum-bum-da-da-da-dum.

00:25:01.170 --> 00:25:03.010
And it's like-- it doesn't stop.

00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:04.520
They're rapping along with us.

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:06.847
They sing the
entire first verse.

00:25:06.847 --> 00:25:08.180
And then afterwards, they like--

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:08.780
LEXI LAWSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.680
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
After the show--

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:10.394
no, they're in.

00:25:10.394 --> 00:25:11.560
I think most of them are in.

00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:12.740
Then there's couple
that are-- you're like,

00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:14.370
they're just like,
not here for this.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.997
But afterwards, I think
the most hilarious thing

00:25:16.997 --> 00:25:19.580
is there's school buses outside
to pick them up and bring them

00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:20.660
back to school.

00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.700
These kids run away
from the school bus

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.590
and start running
towards the stage door.

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:26.270
And I think like, the teachers
are going to get them.

00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.890
No, the teachers run with them.

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:29.387
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:29.387 --> 00:25:31.470
They're like, can you
please sign, take a picture,

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:32.040
oh, my god.

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.581
Like, we've been
studying US history,

00:25:33.581 --> 00:25:35.660
we did a whole Alexander
Hamilton thing.

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:37.707
And they not only
know the musical,

00:25:37.707 --> 00:25:40.040
but they know the history of
everything that's going on.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.240
So they're able to
ask questions that I

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.080
don't have the answers to.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:43.580
I'm like, I didn't read enough.

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:44.910
I'm so sorry.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:45.884
But let me know.

00:25:45.884 --> 00:25:46.550
What do you got?

Yeah, I just play John.

00:25:50.930 --> 00:25:53.045
That's it.

00:25:53.045 --> 00:25:54.680
LEXI LAWSON: It's
fairly inspiring

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.180
to know that these
kids growing up--

00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.100
I mean, from what
you were saying,

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:01.640
James, is that, in high school,
for me, my social studies

00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.300
class--

00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.766
sure, it was exciting,
and history teacher

00:26:05.766 --> 00:26:07.130
was like, really cool--

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:07.940
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
What class were you in?

00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:08.400
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
What class were you in?

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.540
LEXI LAWSON: No, I had a really
cool teacher, Mr. Harvey.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.179
He was cool.

00:26:11.179 --> 00:26:12.220
He played games, and he--

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.200
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Shout out to Mr. Harvey.

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.660
LEXI LAWSON: Mr. Harvey.

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.951
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Mr. Harvey.

00:26:14.951 --> 00:26:16.820
LEXI LAWSON: But I
think it's really cool,

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:17.870
and it inspires me.

00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:20.330
And it's something that I
can't necessarily relate to.

00:26:20.330 --> 00:26:22.370
Like, these kids are
writing us, and saying

00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:27.440
like, I got an A in history
last year because of "Hamilton,"

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.740
and like, history is cool.

00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.260
And I'm like, wow!

00:26:30.260 --> 00:26:31.760
It's just-- I'm sorry.

00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:35.550
I get inspired a lot by
from a lot of people.

00:26:35.550 --> 00:26:42.230
And so there's a part of me that
wishes I was them at this time.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:45.350
Because growing up, Broadway,
for me, wasn't this.

00:26:45.350 --> 00:26:47.300
And so good on Lin!

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:47.800
Yeah.

00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:48.270
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah!

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.895

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.660
INTERVIEWER: That's a good segue
into my next question here.

00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:57.980
I don't know if any
of you guys are aware,

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.271
we're celebrating Hispanic
Heritage Month, and honoring

00:27:00.271 --> 00:27:02.959
contributions to Hispanic-Latino
Americans in the US culture.

00:27:02.959 --> 00:27:04.000
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Hola.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.360
INTERVIEWER: That's right.

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.370
So the Google Cultural
Institute recently

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.980
launched an online
exhibition featuring exhibits

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:13.910
that showcase culture, and
art, and influential figures

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.940
throughout the history
of Latinos in the US.

00:27:16.940 --> 00:27:20.330
As artists, why do you
all think it's important

00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:23.090
that we elevate these
masterpieces, and not just

00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:26.790
Latinos, but all communities
that have been historically

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:27.800
under-represented?

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.060
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Because
this country is a melting pot.

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:37.390
You cannot have America without
all of the Americans who were

00:27:37.390 --> 00:27:41.050
here, whether they came
over here voluntarily,

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:44.350
or whether they came
over here involuntarily.

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:47.890
America would not be what
it is without those pieces.

00:27:47.890 --> 00:27:53.060
There are things in America
that we just take for granted.

00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:54.670
There are rhythms in our music.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:56.320
There are styles in our films.

00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:58.510
There are strokes in our art.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.940
There are sentences
and paragraphs

00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:03.640
that have been written by people
that we just take for granted,

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.820
not knowing that they were
created by a person of color,

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.909
or take it for granted that they
were not written by a woman,

00:28:09.909 --> 00:28:11.950
or take it for granted
that they were not written

00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:14.920
by a poor Caucasian man.

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:18.520
There are certain things in our
country that are just inherent,

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:20.680
and have been there
from the beginning.

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.130
And for us to just gloss
over it, and say oh,

00:28:24.130 --> 00:28:25.060
it's just America.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:27.340
No, we need to
point out-- no, this

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.890
was a Latin man who did this.

00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:30.390
This was a Latin
woman who did this.

00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:31.348
This was a black woman.

00:28:31.348 --> 00:28:32.830
This was a poor
white guy who was

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.670
struggling to get that
American dream he was promised.

00:28:36.670 --> 00:28:38.860
So he wrote something,
and that happened.

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.050
One of the reasons we have
to elevate those people--

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:42.730
so that we can
educate everybody,

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:45.540
so that those kids who we want
to be inspired by can see--

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:47.440
look, there was this
Puerto Rican dude

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.150
who lived in New
York City who had

00:28:49.150 --> 00:28:50.570
a dream of being on Broadway.

00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:52.780
So because he didn't
get the roles he wanted,

00:28:52.780 --> 00:28:54.670
he wrote a show called
"In the Heights."

00:28:54.670 --> 00:28:56.380
Then he turned
around on vacation,

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.380
read a book about a white
man, and wrote a play about it

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:00.520
and put himself in it.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:01.811
You understand what I'm saying?

00:29:01.811 --> 00:29:03.100
I mean, we--

00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:03.600
[CHEERING]

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.600
--need those things.

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:12.410
We need to know that
certain technology was

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:14.230
created by these black folks.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:18.750
We need to know that mostly,
all of the great normal things,

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.690
the way we treat
people, were created

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:22.550
by the women in the
world that brought

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.842
these guys up and taught
them how to speak,

00:29:24.842 --> 00:29:26.300
taught them how to
speak to people,

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.450
taught them how to act like a
man when the dad wasn't around.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.250
We need to elevate those folks.

00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:33.380
So why do we need that?

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.160
Because we need that.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:38.240
Because if not, we are taught
this weird history of, oh,

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:40.070
yeah, these things just happen.

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:42.920
No, America didn't just happen.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.620
Without those pieces,
without those Latin folks,

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:48.770
those black folks, those
Asian folks, the Indians,

00:29:48.770 --> 00:29:50.690
without the women,
without those people,

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:51.960
that stuff wouldn't happen.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.710
And also, we're also
getting to the point,

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:55.668
for those of us of color,
where we get just mad

00:29:55.668 --> 00:29:57.110
at white people for no reason.

00:29:57.110 --> 00:29:59.369
I'm sorry, there were white
people who came over here

00:29:59.369 --> 00:30:00.410
who created this country.

00:30:00.410 --> 00:30:02.180
And yes, there were some
horrible things that happened.

00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.846
But if they hadn't
come over here first,

00:30:03.846 --> 00:30:06.230
we wouldn't be sitting
at Google right now.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.832
So we need to
elevate all of them,

00:30:07.832 --> 00:30:10.040
but we definitely need to
elevate the folks of color.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:12.810
Because their story
hasn't been told yet.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:15.050
And so every time we
elevate someone else

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.730
we're letting some
kids see, oh, I

00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:18.680
can do something else,
which is also pushing

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.420
something else in this country.

00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.820
We have Google because
somebody thought of it.

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.880
Some kid's going to see this,
see this, see you, and go, oh,

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:27.190
snap, I want to make that.

00:30:27.190 --> 00:30:28.460
And they're going to make
something even greater

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:29.610
20 years from now.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:32.220
So we need to
elevate these people

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:34.520
so that this country can
keep being the great country

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.092

like, who lives,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:41.280
who dies, who tells your story?

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.982
And at the very end of the show,
we say who tells your story?

00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:45.690
And I love looking
out into the audience,

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:49.364
and just thinking about what
our purpose all is here,

00:32:49.364 --> 00:32:51.780
and what we're going to leave
behind, and what people will

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.500
remember us for, and
the good that we do,

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:57.191
and just to make the most of the
time that we're on this earth.

00:32:57.191 --> 00:32:57.690
Yeah.

00:32:57.690 --> 00:32:59.606
I think it's an
impacting line for me.

00:32:59.606 --> 00:33:00.235
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: You're going

00:33:00.235 --> 00:33:01.980
to have to help me with this,
because I know the first part.

00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.450
I don't know the second part.

00:33:03.450 --> 00:33:05.360
Legacy, what is a legacy?

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360
JOANNA JONES: Oh.

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:07.076
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Planting seeds--

00:33:07.076 --> 00:33:08.900
ALL: --in the garden
you never get to see.

00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.275
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: The reason

00:33:10.275 --> 00:33:13.850
why that line is cool to me, is
not because of the line itself.

00:33:13.850 --> 00:33:18.776
As a rapper, to put
what is a legacy?

00:33:18.776 --> 00:33:19.400
A legacy is a--

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.135
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Planting seeds

00:33:20.135 --> 00:33:21.250
in a garden you're
never going to see.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:21.346
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Planting seeds

00:33:21.346 --> 00:33:22.930
in a garden you
never get to see.

00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.967
Lin as one of the dopest
lyricists in the world.

00:33:24.967 --> 00:33:26.300
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: He's insane.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.140
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
On the Mixtape,

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:28.640
he has a song with
other rappers.

00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.710
And what's really
fun to me is, here

00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:32.960
are these guys who make
a living being rappers.

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.570
And here's this musical
theater guy who eats them up--

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:37.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.420
--in the rap.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:41.150
That line, the way it's written,
the way the rhyme scheme is,

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:44.150
the way it comes in, the fact
that legacy and never get

00:33:44.150 --> 00:33:44.987
to see--

00:33:44.987 --> 00:33:47.570
legacy is a word, never get to
see-- that's a couple of words,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.450
that he put that together.

00:33:48.450 --> 00:33:50.150
That is one of the
coolest lines in the show.

00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.650
To be just, as a
writer, you're just

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.932
like, that is just amazing.

00:33:54.932 --> 00:33:57.170
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Yeah, next question.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:33:58.610
AUDIENCE: So you're
doing did this

00:33:58.610 --> 00:34:02.730
show many days a week, for
many weeks, for many months

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:03.230
sometimes.

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:05.480
It's obviously an
amazing show, but how do

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.100
you kind of keep
your job interesting?

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.107
Do you guys ever
get bored of doing--

00:34:10.107 --> 00:34:11.690
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Well, number one--

00:34:11.690 --> 00:34:12.470
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:34:12.470 --> 00:34:13.850
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
There's, literally, there's

00:34:13.850 --> 00:34:15.056
many ways we keep
our jobs interesting.

00:34:15.056 --> 00:34:15.949
LEXI LAWSON: There's
so many, yeah.

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:16.639
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Number one, I think,

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:19.440
honestly, the thing that
keeps you on your toes

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:21.064
and invested
constantly is that--

00:34:21.064 --> 00:34:22.150
INTERVIEWER: The
double turntable.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.030
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
The double turntable.

00:34:23.030 --> 00:34:24.154
JOANNA JONES: Oh!

00:34:24.154 --> 00:34:24.469
LEXI LAWSON: Of course.

00:34:24.469 --> 00:34:25.370
You get used to that, though.

00:34:25.370 --> 00:34:27.036
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
The turntable, yeah.

00:34:27.036 --> 00:34:28.719
That suddenly becomes nonsense.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:32.000
But this show is hard.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.710
And because of that,
there's a rotating cast.

00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:36.139
Like I was out last night.

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:37.219
I'm probably going
to be out tonight.

00:34:37.219 --> 00:34:38.480
I have a [? messed ?] up knee.

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.370
But it makes you have to
work with someone new that

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.929
has a different
interpretation of the role.

00:34:41.929 --> 00:34:43.159
So constantly, I'm looking--

00:34:43.159 --> 00:34:44.989
my mom is a different
person sometimes.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.260
I'm like, all right, what
are you going to do, mom?

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.130
And this mom doesn't go to the
left, she goes to the right.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:51.550
And she doesn't want to
conduct, she just punches me.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:51.975
JOANNA JONES: (LAUGHING) Yeah.

00:34:51.975 --> 00:34:53.370
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: And I'm
like, Syndee used to punch me.

00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:54.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:56.960
Like, it keeps you invested.

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:59.062
And then off-stage, we're
a bunch of goofballs.

00:34:59.062 --> 00:35:01.020
There's no one serious
in that building at all.

00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:01.700
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: I don't
know what you all are doing.

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:02.856
I'm very serious.

00:35:02.856 --> 00:35:03.356
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:03.356 --> 00:35:04.172
LEXI LAWSON: Oh no.

00:35:04.172 --> 00:35:07.790
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Look, in
a purple velour pimp suit,

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.667
there is nothing
serious about this man.

00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:10.421
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:10.421 --> 00:35:11.300
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.290
And plus, we have a lot
of lines to deliver.

00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:18.561
There's no way you can become--

00:35:18.561 --> 00:35:19.560
what is it called when--

00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:19.940
JOANNA JONES: Complacent?

00:35:19.940 --> 00:35:20.540
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Checked out?

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.831
LEXI LAWSON: Like, checked out.

00:35:21.831 --> 00:35:24.110
Some people, they're
doing eight shows a week,

00:35:24.110 --> 00:35:25.085
it's robotic for them.

00:35:25.085 --> 00:35:26.460
You can't do that
with this show.

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.001
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Not this show.

00:35:28.001 --> 00:35:29.810
LEXI LAWSON: We must deliver--

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:32.210
I mean, how many
words are in our show?

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:32.380
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: Ridiculous.

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.040
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: And we
get eaten up sometimes, too.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:35.040
Sometimes, the words
start coming out,

00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.860
and then you start saying
things about bananas,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.580
and you don't know what--

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:38.330
LEXI LAWSON: Right,
it's happening.

00:35:38.330 --> 00:35:38.990
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
It just happened.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.100
Not me.

00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.120
Not one of anyone of us.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:41.270
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
How dare you?

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:41.696
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:41.696 --> 00:35:42.548
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: None of us.

00:35:42.548 --> 00:35:43.881
JOANNA JONES: It wasn't even us.

00:35:43.881 --> 00:35:45.210
No.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.360
LEXI LAWSON: I think we're
very alive and present.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:47.440
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:49.148
LEXI LAWSON: And
especially because we're

00:35:49.148 --> 00:35:52.140
telling a story that
needs to be told,

00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.449
there's no room to
become complacent.

00:35:54.449 --> 00:35:55.490
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:58.280
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Also,
every night, is a new audience.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:58.760
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.060
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: I mean, we

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:00.500
do have repeat
people who come back.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.600
But most the time, it's a
brand new group of people.

00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.220
And these people paid
their hard-earned money

00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:05.210
to come see the show.

00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:08.280
So you really want to give
them the best show possible.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.240
We know how we would
feel if we paid a hundred

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:11.360
some-odd dollars to see a show.

00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.443
We don't want people coming
in, just be like phone

00:36:13.443 --> 00:36:15.216
it in, like, yeah, it's cool.

00:36:15.216 --> 00:36:17.904
You're like, yeah, I'mma
just phone this in, you know.

00:36:17.904 --> 00:36:20.320
And people are laughing because
I said a hundred some-odd.

00:36:20.320 --> 00:36:20.963
They're like--

00:36:20.963 --> 00:36:22.569

00:36:22.569 --> 00:36:24.110

wait, where'd you

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:25.030

That is not what I paid!

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:32.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.325
Talk to my broker
about that one.

00:36:35.325 --> 00:36:36.950
But yeah, you want
to give the audience

00:36:36.950 --> 00:36:38.230
the best show possible.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:42.680
And when those people pay
astronomical amounts of money

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.769
to see the show, you want to
give them everything you can.

00:36:45.769 --> 00:36:47.810
Because folks-- don't get
me wrong, they love us.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:49.820
But if you've waited
a year, you don't

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.320
care if somebody is sick
or hurt, or something.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:52.420
You're like, I want
to see "Hamilton."

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.600
It better be good too.

00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:56.596

try to give them.

just one tower in the house.

And then I'm doing
the show, and I'm

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.170
like, whoever's sitting
behind that person

00:37:36.170 --> 00:37:37.760
must feel so shitty,
because they're not

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.110
seeing "Hamilton" tonight.

00:37:38.110 --> 00:37:38.830

neither is the other person

behind that person.

JOANNA JONES: That's sad.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:44.931
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: But
then I find out it's him.

00:37:44.931 --> 00:37:46.700
And then I spent the
whole show thinking,

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:47.720
what is he
experiencing right now?

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.500
Because it was right
after he got fired.

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:51.922
So it was this like, mind--

00:37:51.922 --> 00:37:52.880
I'm not going to curse.

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.240
Mind--

00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:53.890
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
You already did.

00:37:53.890 --> 00:37:54.590
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I did?

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:54.830
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yeah.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:55.954
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Whoops.

00:37:55.954 --> 00:37:56.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:56.641 --> 00:37:57.140
Mind--

00:37:57.140 --> 00:37:58.550
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: There's
a child in the audience, man.

00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:59.799
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Sorry, hi!

00:37:59.799 --> 00:38:01.942
ALL: Hi.

00:38:01.942 --> 00:38:03.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:03.462 --> 00:38:05.920
It just messed with my mind,
to like, spending the entire--

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:07.640
I'm thinking, like,
what is he experiencing

00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.431
watching this show?

00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:10.130
And then Sanjay
Gupta was there too.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:11.660
I didn't say that right.

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.915
But then, we had a conversation
about what he experienced

00:38:14.915 --> 00:38:16.040
probably watching the show.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:20.414
And it was just like, god, being
in American politics, watching

00:38:20.414 --> 00:38:22.580
American politics, the
history of America politics--

00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:24.290
oh, god, it was awesome.

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:25.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:25.705
So cool.

00:38:25.705 --> 00:38:26.580
That was my favorite.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:27.330
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:38:27.330 --> 00:38:28.660
That's a good one.

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:29.894
I mean-- ooh, jeez.

00:38:29.894 --> 00:38:31.185
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Go Lexi.

00:38:31.185 --> 00:38:33.530
LEXI LAWSON: Every time.

00:38:33.530 --> 00:38:35.912
We get a lot of
celebrities and people.

00:38:35.912 --> 00:38:36.620
I don't know who.

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.621
I really enjoyed when
Hillary Clinton came.

00:38:38.621 --> 00:38:39.620
That was my second show.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.120
[CHEERING]

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.226
JOANNA JONES: Whoa.

00:38:41.226 --> 00:38:43.552
[APPLAUSE]

00:38:43.552 --> 00:38:44.510
My second show was her.

00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:48.030
And I was like, ah, but she's
fantastic, and she's amazing.

00:38:48.030 --> 00:38:50.470
And you know--

00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:51.320
OK.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.764
I'm not going to elaborate.

00:38:52.764 --> 00:38:53.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:53.610 --> 00:38:55.670
But that was something else.

00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:57.640
That was something else,
and really special.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:58.205
Yeah.

00:38:58.205 --> 00:38:59.015
INTERVIEWER: Do you
have a favorite?

00:38:59.015 --> 00:39:00.110
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
I do, but it's

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:00.880
because it's going
to sound really bad.

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:01.760
JOANNA JONES: Oh, no.

00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.676
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
I don't get tripped out

00:39:03.676 --> 00:39:05.280
by regular celebrities.

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:07.120
I don't get tripped
out by politicians.

00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.930
I'm like, yeah, whatever.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.930
I am a certifiable nerd.

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:14.600
And I am a huge comic book nerd.

00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:15.770
I am a huge musical nerd.

00:39:15.770 --> 00:39:17.640
And I'm a huge professional
wrestling nerd.

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:18.140
Yes.

00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:18.639
I said it.

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:20.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:23.660
And the former United States
WWE champion, Kevin Owens

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:27.987
came to the show, and I lost it.

00:39:27.987 --> 00:39:29.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:35.690
Because he's an amazing
heel/villian on the WWE.

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:37.310
And everybody knows
how horrible he is

00:39:37.310 --> 00:39:38.380
and what he does,
blah, blah, blah.

00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.180
And he comes to this
show with his wife,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:41.180
and he's the nicest guy.

00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:42.410
And he's like, oh, my god.

00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:43.040
How do you do that?

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:43.940
You're jumping off a table.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:45.148
You're going around a circle.

00:39:45.148 --> 00:39:47.300
And I'm like, you fell
off a cage last night!

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.250
What are you talking about?

00:39:50.250 --> 00:39:52.130
Like, I've met some
of the guys before,

00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:55.640
and they come to "Hamilton,"
and they literally trip out.

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.785
They're like do you
guys do this every week?

00:39:57.785 --> 00:39:58.910
I mean, how does it happen?

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.618
And I'm looking at
them like, I literally

00:40:00.618 --> 00:40:03.650
saw you step on
a man last night,

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.442
and you are amazed
by what we're doing?

00:40:06.442 --> 00:40:08.650
And so we just had a great
nerd-to-nerd relationship.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.580
Like, he loves musical
theater, I love wrestling.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:11.750
So we just had a great time.

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.980
So people were like, James.

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:13.850
James Comey's here!

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:14.930
I was like, yeah,
yeah, what's up, dude?

00:40:14.930 --> 00:40:15.540
You got fired.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.282
Cool.

00:40:16.282 --> 00:40:17.557
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:17.557 --> 00:40:20.015
And other people come, I'm
like, oh, Shaq, what's up, bruh?

00:40:20.015 --> 00:40:22.052
Hey, bruh, cool-- you
know, WWE comes up,

00:40:22.052 --> 00:40:23.343
I'm like, (YELLING) I love you!

00:40:23.343 --> 00:40:24.862
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:24.862 --> 00:40:26.450
INTERVIEWER: You
have a favorite?

00:40:26.450 --> 00:40:27.020
JOANNA JONES: I don't know.

00:40:27.020 --> 00:40:28.860
I mean, I've only been
there a few weeks.

00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:30.800
There's been some dope
people coming through.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.020
Chance the Rapper, everyone
was really excited--

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:32.150
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh my god!

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:32.810
JOANNA JONES:
--about him coming.

00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:33.360
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh yeah.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.027
He was there.

00:40:34.027 --> 00:40:36.360
JOANNA JONES: And Shaquille
O'Neal was there last night.

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.160
That was fun.

00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.493
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Now, see.

00:40:38.493 --> 00:40:39.500
That's a big dude.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.344
Shaquille is bigger
than James Comey.

00:40:41.344 --> 00:40:42.635
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh, my god.

00:40:42.635 --> 00:40:42.890
JOANNA JONES: By height?

00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:43.730
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Shaquille is 7'.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.730
And Shaquille--

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:45.900
LEXI LAWSON: I don't know.

00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:46.870
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
--touched my hand,

00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:48.828
and literally, the
brother's fingers were here.

00:40:48.828 --> 00:40:49.670
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:56.140
It was like, you know when
men try to shake hands,

00:40:56.140 --> 00:40:56.890
we try to be cool.

00:40:56.890 --> 00:40:58.235
We don't want to be too
bad, we want to be manly.

00:40:58.235 --> 00:40:59.750
Be like, yo man, what's up?

00:40:59.750 --> 00:41:01.470
He was like, yo,
dude [INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:02.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:03.590
All right, dude.

00:41:03.590 --> 00:41:04.870
Cool.

00:41:04.870 --> 00:41:06.900
It's like, you can't be
too manly around him.

00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.676
You're like, you're so big.

00:41:08.676 --> 00:41:13.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.287
(LAUGHING) I wish you
could have seen it.

00:41:16.287 --> 00:41:17.620
JOANNA JONES: Dude, it was wild.

00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.250
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: All the
dudes kept walking away going,

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.687
do you feel small?

00:41:20.687 --> 00:41:21.561
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:21.561 --> 00:41:25.160
I know I am 275 pounds,
but I feel little.

00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.006
JOANNA JONES: Oh my god.

00:41:27.006 --> 00:41:28.400
INTERVIEWER: That's good.

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.120
Let's take another
question here.

00:41:30.120 --> 00:41:30.780
AUDIENCE: All
right first of all,

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.238
thank you all for
coming very much.

00:41:32.238 --> 00:41:33.020
ALL: Thank you.

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.670
AUDIENCE: My wife and I love to
rap to the instrumental album.

00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:37.900
And it is hard,
between some of rhythms

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:42.157
and the amazing stuff Lin did
together, it is so incredible.

00:41:42.157 --> 00:41:44.740
Especially "Lafayette," how fast
some of those lines come out.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.430
And I'm not even thinking about
facial expressions, and stage

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.945
positioning.

00:41:47.945 --> 00:41:48.820
So I have to wonder--

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.100
I'm sure it's never happened.

00:41:50.100 --> 00:41:52.776
But should you fudge a
line or just come out--

00:41:52.776 --> 00:41:53.688
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:53.688 --> 00:41:56.996
--how do you recover, given
how fast-paced the show is?

00:41:56.996 --> 00:41:58.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:58.270 --> 00:42:00.140
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
You're right.

00:42:00.140 --> 00:42:00.900
You're right.

00:42:00.900 --> 00:42:01.750
It's never happened to me.

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:02.250
Right!

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:05.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.790
You know what's funny?

00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:09.720
There's this old, old
saying on Broadway,

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.730
"The show must go on."

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:15.710
I have honestly, only messed
up "Guns and Ships" once.

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:16.530
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:18.390
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: And
I say once because I never

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:19.376
wanted to do it again.

00:42:19.376 --> 00:42:20.250
JOANNA JONES: Oh, no.

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.375
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: And
it sounded as if someone

00:42:22.375 --> 00:42:24.060
had skipped the record.

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:25.864
So I said, I'm
taking this hook--

00:42:25.864 --> 00:42:26.780
I'm taking this hook--

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:27.697
I'm taking this hook--

00:42:27.697 --> 00:42:29.905
I'm taking this hook-- and
I never going (SPUTTERING)

00:42:29.905 --> 00:42:30.660
and I went on.

00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.874
And you could see
the dancers going--

00:42:32.874 --> 00:42:36.213
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:36.213 --> 00:42:39.419
JOANNA JONES: Oh no!

00:42:39.419 --> 00:42:40.960
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
And basically,

00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.080
once my brain rebooted, you
just have to keep going.

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.160
There is no stop.

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.900
And also, the way
our band works,

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.220
they just have to keep going.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.480
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
You're on a train.

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:50.110
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Literally, you

00:42:50.110 --> 00:42:51.159
are on a musical train.

00:42:51.159 --> 00:42:51.700
It just goes.

00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.020
So once I messed up, I
got it and kept stepping.

00:42:54.020 --> 00:42:57.370
So we've all had
some kind of flubs.

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.040
And the crazy thing
is, with most musicals,

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.960
most people don't
know all the lyrics.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.980
This is "Hamilton."

00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:05.050
Everybody knows every lyric.

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:06.660
So you can see
the whole audience

00:43:06.660 --> 00:43:08.746
do this collective, huh?

00:43:08.746 --> 00:43:09.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:10.520
LEXI LAWSON: Huh?

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.150
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: So you
just get back on it and go.

00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:16.390
And then we have this great
thing on Instagram called

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:18.080
#burrscorner.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:21.250
So if you guys want to go
to it, #burrscorner, you

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.380
get to see all of us
discuss our mess-ups.

00:43:24.380 --> 00:43:29.117
Because the "Hamilton"
fan family is so big,

00:43:29.117 --> 00:43:30.700
the last thing you
want is for someone

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:34.699
to go out and start scooping
you on your own story.

00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:36.490
Tweeting, ooh, Lafayette
messed up tonight.

00:43:36.490 --> 00:43:38.530
So we quickly go backstage
and tell the fans,

00:43:38.530 --> 00:43:39.660
yo, we messed up,
this is what happened.

00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:40.480
They're like, oh,
that's so funny.

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:41.780
We're like, oh good,
we got in front of it,

00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:42.696
we got in front of it.

00:43:42.696 --> 00:43:43.925

00:43:43.925 --> 00:43:45.672
That's basically what it is.

00:43:45.672 --> 00:43:47.380
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah that
happened recently.

00:43:47.380 --> 00:43:48.000
INTERVIEWER: The rest
of you are all perfect.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.215
Let it lay.

00:43:49.215 --> 00:43:50.651
LEXI LAWSON: No, definitely not.

00:43:50.651 --> 00:43:52.900
AUDIENCE: Thanks for having
this conversation with us.

00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:52.930
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:54.180
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Of course.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.250
AUDIENCE: Several of
you have mentioned

00:43:56.250 --> 00:44:01.010
it's important to change the
mind of people in the theater

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:02.280
about who can play what.

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.520
And we've talked about learning
about the women behind the men

00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.700
throughout history, and
anyone can play anyone.

00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:12.005
So how about women
playing male roles?

00:44:12.005 --> 00:44:13.880
LEXI LAWSON: Well yeah,
I've been saying that

00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:14.440
from the beginning.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:14.465
Go ahead.

[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.090

So I have a dream--

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:16.405
LEXI LAWSON: OK.

00:44:16.405 --> 00:44:16.905
OK.

00:44:16.905 --> 00:44:19.900
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: --that one
day, Uzo Aduba will be Burr.

00:44:19.900 --> 00:44:21.901
Because that would be the
most incredible thing.

00:44:21.901 --> 00:44:23.483
INTERVIEWER: Oh that
would be amazing.

00:44:23.483 --> 00:44:24.020
She--

00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:25.580
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: She
has to fight Cynthia Erivo.

00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:27.064
Cynthia wants it really bad.

00:44:27.064 --> 00:44:29.480
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Look they
can both do it back to back.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:29.979
[INAUDIBLE]

00:44:29.979 --> 00:44:32.191
But you know, four shows
each, six months each.

00:44:32.191 --> 00:44:33.940
Whatever you want, I'm
down to watch, just

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.340
be at the gospel, that
would be that experience.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:37.940
Because hell yeah.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:38.600
LEXI LAWSON: I think
it's going to happen.

00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:39.530
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
It'll happen, I think.

00:44:39.530 --> 00:44:39.820
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
I think it will.

00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:41.020
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
I'm not Bethany Knox

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:41.860
from Telsey Casting.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.164
But if you are Bethany

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:46.830
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: You know.

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:48.558

00:44:51.188 --> 00:44:52.247
INTERVIEWER: Yeah?

00:44:52.247 --> 00:44:52.830
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:54.950
You all kind of touched on
this a little bit already,

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:55.990
but I was wondering
if you could talk

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.830
about what it's like interacting
with the fans of this show

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.330
and how it's, maybe, different
from other shows you've done,

00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.470
or if it's not different?

00:45:02.470 --> 00:45:03.115
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh, my god.

00:45:03.115 --> 00:45:05.200
JOANNA JONES: I think
it's really beautiful when

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:08.462
you meet people and you
hear how long they've

00:45:08.462 --> 00:45:09.670
been waiting to see the show.

00:45:09.670 --> 00:45:12.610
And you don't know what
they did to get there

00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:15.122
and what it means to them
personally and stuff.

00:45:15.122 --> 00:45:16.580
So getting to talk
to those people,

00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.920
and just see the
light in their eyes,

00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.670
and see what it means
to them specifically

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.500
is just so rewarding.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.839
And I also love talking
to the little children.

00:45:23.839 --> 00:45:24.880
They're just so adorable.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:28.250
And I want to know what they're
seeing when they see the show.

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:30.920
I loved this one time when I
met this little 7-year-old boy.

00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.320
And I was like, hey,
did you like the show?

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.980
And he was like, well, I liked
Act I. I was like, oh my god,

00:45:34.980 --> 00:45:35.936
what do you mean?

00:45:35.936 --> 00:45:37.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.400
He was like, Act
II was really sad.

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:41.790
I was like, (LAUGHING)
I know it was.

00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:42.290

LEXI LAWSON: That's awesome.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:49.330
I think what's interesting,
with our fans, that's

00:45:49.330 --> 00:45:56.120
different from any other show
is this new idea of fanart.

00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:58.780
I've never experienced fanart
in any of my other shows

00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.750
where they draw you.

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.820
And it's interesting,
because, let's say, I

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:06.250
put up a picture
with Joanna and Mandy

00:46:06.250 --> 00:46:08.740
Gonzalez, who plays Angelica.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:13.900
A week later, comes this
beautifully drawn art

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:15.619
of the picture, and it's good.

00:46:15.619 --> 00:46:16.660
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:18.550
LEXI LAWSON: I mean, you
could buy these pictures

00:46:18.550 --> 00:46:20.341
and blow them up and
put them on your wall.

00:46:20.341 --> 00:46:20.950
And I'm like--

00:46:20.950 --> 00:46:22.160
I don't know how--
does anybody know how

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.327
to draw in here really well?

00:46:23.327 --> 00:46:25.618
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: This
is Google, are you serious?

00:46:25.618 --> 00:46:26.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.127 --> 00:46:27.460
LEXI LAWSON: Drawing for me is--

00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:30.970
I don't know how it works.

00:46:30.970 --> 00:46:33.520
I can't wrap my head
around it and how you

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.860
can be so precise and perfect.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:36.940
And they're just fantastic.

00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:39.160
This new generation
of children have

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.670
been birthed knowing
how to draw, apparently.

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:43.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:45.930
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:46.480
It's amazing.

00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.554
And so the girls share a suite
with three different rooms

00:46:50.554 --> 00:46:52.720
where our dressing rooms
are, and we have a hallway.

00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:55.420
And so that's where we put
all of our fanart there.

00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:57.595
So we have a fanart wall,
which is really beautiful.

00:46:57.595 --> 00:46:59.720
INTERVIEWER: They'll actually
mail in the pictures?

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:00.700

mail in the pictures.

to the stage door with them.

I'm talking like, I'm
going to blow up the art.

you're an artist?

studying medicine.

ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
What do you mean?

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.150
And I guess the fact that
your hand has to be so--

00:47:31.150 --> 00:47:32.020
I don't know.

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:35.260

00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:35.940
I don't know.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:37.550
But the art is incredible.

LEXI LAWSON: No, it's amazing.

00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:39.900
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: But I
think the most incredible thing

00:47:39.900 --> 00:47:42.480
is that our fan has no
face or age or race.

00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.390
It's just like a conglomerate
of any type of person.

00:47:45.390 --> 00:47:48.457
And there are people
celebrating their 90th birthday

00:47:48.457 --> 00:47:50.790
at the show, and they're
celebrating their 7th birthday.

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:53.910

line, and both of them

00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:56.490
That's awesome.

Where do you get that?

00:47:58.129 --> 00:48:00.670
I haven't been in a show that
has had that experience before.

last question.

One more.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.570
OK, so I'll try to
make-- mine is quick,

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:15.820
but it's kind of two parts.

00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:18.390
First part is, you've have
this amazing experience now

00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:22.370
that has really elevated
the voice, the perspective

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:23.580
around theater.

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:27.000
Given your backgrounds, given
the diversity of the cast,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.770
being a Latina in
tech, sometimes I

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.870
feel like, because
I'm under-represented

00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:32.850
in an environment
like this, that I

00:48:32.850 --> 00:48:36.240
have a sense of
responsibility, which I do.

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:39.660
Showing up authentically,
showing up with a purpose,

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.640
unapologetically,
but at the same time,

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.620
having to be perfect.

00:48:43.620 --> 00:48:45.690
Do you get this same sense?

00:48:45.690 --> 00:48:47.070
Do you have those
sentiments when

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:48.830
you go and you are performing?

00:48:48.830 --> 00:48:50.832
Do you have this sense
of responsibility

00:48:50.832 --> 00:48:52.845
and a sense of
having to be perfect?

00:48:52.845 --> 00:48:55.270
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah, I 100% do.

00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:58.620
But I also think the
ideal expectation

00:48:58.620 --> 00:49:00.540
of wanting to be perfect
is also your demise.

00:49:00.540 --> 00:49:02.010
It's also your downfall.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:04.200
And I've learned that
with this show, that,

00:49:04.200 --> 00:49:09.660
when I took a backseat to
not having to show up and try

00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.880
to be perfect, but just try
to do the best that I can

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:12.690
every day.

00:49:12.690 --> 00:49:15.120
And then that's
when I realize life,

00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.690
and that fears have
subsided, and then I

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:23.730
can be who I am
without necessarily

00:49:23.730 --> 00:49:28.530
being apologetic or feeling that
I have to represent something

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:30.270
a specific way every day.

00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.150
Because we're all human,
and we all make mistakes.

00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:36.450
And even though
I'm of color, I'm

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:40.020
trying my best to represent
who I am with knowing

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.670
that I am not perfect.

00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:46.730
So that's my advice, at least
for this, is that I come and do

00:49:46.730 --> 00:49:49.397
"Hamilton," I tell this story,
I do it to my best ability,

00:49:49.397 --> 00:49:51.480
because I know that this
message has to get there.

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:54.582
But I'm the messenger, you know?

00:49:54.582 --> 00:49:56.900
AUDIENCE: Thank you,
[INAUDIBLE] So now

00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.000
that we've talked about how
this experience has really

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.590
elevated, what's next for you?

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:02.250
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Oh, my god.

00:50:02.250 --> 00:50:03.990
AUDIENCE: Now that you have this
experience, after "Hamilton,"

00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:05.820
let's say, do you have
any idea in mind what

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:06.653
you want to do next?

00:50:06.653 --> 00:50:08.410
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
The sky's the limit.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:09.307
ALL: Yeah.

00:50:09.307 --> 00:50:10.890
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
But I think we all

00:50:10.890 --> 00:50:13.710
have aspirations for
more TV and film.

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:16.056
And I will say this.

00:50:16.056 --> 00:50:17.430
The thing that is
really weird is

00:50:17.430 --> 00:50:20.242
that now, reading a script,
when it comes to me, if it's

00:50:20.242 --> 00:50:21.700
a theater script,
I go oh, but this

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.470
isn't as good as
"Hamilton," so now what?

00:50:23.470 --> 00:50:23.860
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:25.320
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
And everything

00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:27.120
has to rise to the occasion.

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:30.030
And it's both
amazing and horrible.

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.890
Because now I'm
judging everything

00:50:31.890 --> 00:50:33.040
in a very different way.

00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:35.980
But it's just because
Lin wrote a dope musical.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.150
And like, why would I
want to not do this?

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:42.680
Now my aspiration is I want
to escape into other roles.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:43.610
When are you bouncing?

00:50:43.610 --> 00:50:46.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.627
LEXI LAWSON: But I also
think, as a society,

00:50:48.627 --> 00:50:50.460
and what's going on
right now in the world--

00:50:50.460 --> 00:50:52.626
and I feel like it's important
to say this, is that,

00:50:52.626 --> 00:50:55.170
the reason why there's five
companies of "Hamilton"

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:56.635
that's going--

00:50:56.635 --> 00:50:58.260
there's one that's
coming up in London.

00:50:58.260 --> 00:50:59.850
And there's another second
tour that's coming out--

00:50:59.850 --> 00:51:01.433
is that this message
of the show needs

00:51:01.433 --> 00:51:03.129
to be told, especially
with the times

00:51:03.129 --> 00:51:04.420
that we're living in right now.

00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:06.794
And so if you're not
familiar with "Hamilton,"

00:51:06.794 --> 00:51:08.460
then I suggest that
you buy an the album

00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.876
and listen to the
political views.

00:51:09.876 --> 00:51:11.730
Because although we
are a Broadway show,

00:51:11.730 --> 00:51:13.680
we are talking politics.

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:15.690
And I think it's a
really wonderful idea

00:51:15.690 --> 00:51:18.060
that, as actors, we've
had the ability to be

00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:20.580
able to use "Hamilton"
as a platform to share

00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:22.170
our personal views on politics.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:24.780
And you can very much see
how we feel on Twitter

00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:28.920
about a lot of things and
to be able to have the voice

00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:31.470
to be able to share what maybe
you all are thinking as well.

00:51:31.470 --> 00:51:34.000
And you all may not necessarily
have the voice to do that.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.166
And that's why I feel like
things like with the NFL,

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:38.110
and things like
that are going on--

00:51:38.110 --> 00:51:39.741
and I won't get into
that-- but that's

00:51:39.741 --> 00:51:41.490
why I think "Hamilton's"
really important,

00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:44.620
so that we can share this
message across the world.

00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:46.290
And so what's next
is that I hope

00:51:46.290 --> 00:51:49.980
to continue sharing messages
that will uplift and encourage,

00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:53.790
inspire in any way or
any capacity, someone

00:51:53.790 --> 00:51:54.947
to be their better selves.

00:51:54.947 --> 00:51:57.030
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: And
also, the main message,

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:59.279
at least what I
take from the show,

00:51:59.279 --> 00:52:00.570
is history has its eyes on you.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:01.470
LEXI LAWSON: Yeah.

00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:03.886
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: What
are you going to do with that?

00:52:03.886 --> 00:52:06.120
As a person-- you say
that as a Latina woman,

00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:08.880
you feel that you have to
come in here and be perfect.

00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.661
Just be you.

00:52:10.661 --> 00:52:11.160
Just being--

00:52:11.160 --> 00:52:12.420
AUDIENCE: Pave the way.

00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:13.250
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Well, of course.

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.660
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: Yeah.

00:52:13.660 --> 00:52:13.870
LEXI LAWSON: Yes!

00:52:13.870 --> 00:52:14.010
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Yes.

00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:14.490
LEXI LAWSON: Paving the way.

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:16.000
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Paving
the way for other folks.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.520
But what's funny is history
does have its eyes on you.

00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.070
And it sees what you're doing.

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.610
And the way folks see you and
what you bring to the table,

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.360
they go, oh, cool, I
met a girl like that.

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:27.650
That's cool, that they
see someone else that

00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:29.505
maybe looks similar or
has your personality.

00:52:29.505 --> 00:52:31.080
They can go, oh,
yeah, you know what?

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:32.700
Yes, you know what I mean?

00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.300
So I feel that that's
what the show says.

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:38.830
The show says what
you're doing is not

00:52:38.830 --> 00:52:40.924
just not being seen by people.

00:52:40.924 --> 00:52:43.090
When you come to work,
you're representing yourself,

00:52:43.090 --> 00:52:44.635
but also, you're bringing
your heritage with you.

00:52:44.635 --> 00:52:45.400
You're bringing your style.

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:47.590
You're bringing your mom's
views, your dad's views,

00:52:47.590 --> 00:52:48.730
your family's views.

00:52:48.730 --> 00:52:51.790
And those positive things
are going to touch folks.

00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:54.580
And I think the reason
why the five shows go out,

00:52:54.580 --> 00:52:58.210
they let people know look,
hey, you may disagree with me,

00:52:58.210 --> 00:53:02.020
but it's how you respond
to the disagreement

00:53:02.020 --> 00:53:04.090
that people are going to
remember, not the fact

00:53:04.090 --> 00:53:05.215
that we had a disagreement.

00:53:05.215 --> 00:53:07.446
It's going to be how
you responded to it.

00:53:07.446 --> 00:53:09.070
Are you going to do
something positive,

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:11.070
or are you going to go
out there and act a fool?

00:53:11.070 --> 00:53:12.329
History has its eyes on you.

00:53:12.329 --> 00:53:13.120
Folks are watching.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:13.630
LEXI LAWSON: And at Google--

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:16.670
I mean, Google and "Hamilton"
correlate very well together.

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:17.230
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
They're like sisters.

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:19.313
LEXI LAWSON: You guys are
at the top of your game,

00:53:19.313 --> 00:53:21.040
and so are we.

00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.065
I would work for Google.

00:53:22.065 --> 00:53:23.356
I'm ready to come work for you.

00:53:23.356 --> 00:53:24.225
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:24.225 --> 00:53:24.724
[INAUDIBLE]

00:53:24.724 --> 00:53:26.206
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:26.206 --> 00:53:28.720
I want to be here.

00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.796
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
You want get the one more?

00:53:30.796 --> 00:53:31.210
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.

00:53:31.210 --> 00:53:31.670
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: You
wan to get that one more?

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.870
She's got one more.

00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.970
Come on.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:34.635
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, let's do
one more question over here.

00:53:34.635 --> 00:53:36.968
AUDIENCE: Thank you, guys,
so much for being here today.

00:53:36.968 --> 00:53:38.410
JAMES MONROE
IGLEHART: No problem.

00:53:38.410 --> 00:53:40.135
AUDIENCE: So I want to ask--

00:53:40.135 --> 00:53:45.510
so growing up, studying
theater, and even up until now,

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:50.410
who have you looked up to,
or who has influenced you

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:53.110
and what did you learn
from them, or whatever,

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:58.012
how did you bring
that into your role?

00:53:58.012 --> 00:54:00.960
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
I have a few folks.

00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:04.680
First, I got to say my mom was
a music teacher for 38 years.

00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.430
She's retired now.

00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:07.230
And my dad was an
actor in the '70s.

00:54:07.230 --> 00:54:11.220
So I always had this
around the house.

00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.462
The way I act--

00:54:12.462 --> 00:54:13.420
just imagine a cookout.

00:54:16.280 --> 00:54:18.622
A bunch of Igleharts just
all doing characters, being

00:54:18.622 --> 00:54:19.830
ridiculous, and being stupid.

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.000
That was my household.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.267
But there were certain
people in musical theater

00:54:24.267 --> 00:54:25.100
that I looked up to.

00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:27.210
There was a guy
named Ted Ross, who

00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:30.000
was the original Lion in
"The Wiz," who won the Best

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:32.340
Featured Actor Tony in 1979.

00:54:32.340 --> 00:54:34.950
Then there was Chuck
Cooper who won,

00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:38.012
I think, in 1996, he
played "In the Life."

00:54:38.012 --> 00:54:39.720
And then there was
Brian Stokes Mitchell,

00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:40.980
Norm Lewis-- all those guys.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:42.840
And what's funny is
three of those guys,

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:48.000
I'm actually friends with, which
is weird, to be in college,

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.840
and listen to the CDs
and go, oh my gosh,

00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.759
it'd be so cool to
sing like those guys,

00:54:51.759 --> 00:54:53.550
and then be next to
them, and talk to them,

00:54:53.550 --> 00:54:54.591
and have them talk to me.

00:54:54.591 --> 00:54:58.890
So they were great influences
on what I do on the stage.

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:01.470
But also guys I never thought--

00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:02.996
I didn't get to
meet them-- but I

00:55:02.996 --> 00:55:05.620
got to meet a couple my heroes,
Whoopi Goldberg, Billy Crystal.

00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:07.950
And I didn't get to
meet Robin Williams,

00:55:07.950 --> 00:55:09.660
but I met folks that knew him.

00:55:09.660 --> 00:55:11.220
And folks that came
to see "Aladdin"

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:13.520
told me that he saw the clips.

00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:15.000
And he-- meet a
lot of the heroes

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.550
that I grew up looking up.

00:55:16.550 --> 00:55:19.680
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: I think the
most influential, growing up,

00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:22.210
was John Leguizamo for me.

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:24.900
The things he did, and the
things he still continues to do

00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:26.460
are insane.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:29.090
There's nobody, there's
no reincarnation of him.

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:29.760
It won't happen.

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:32.079
He is a master at what he does.

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:34.370
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: The
best solo performer, period.

00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:37.860
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: If you have
not seen him do a solo show,

00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:40.025
I think HBO right now
has-- is HBO affiliated?

00:55:40.025 --> 00:55:40.950
I don't know.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.900
HBO has "Ghetto
Clown" right now.

00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:45.801
And "Ghetto Clown"
is phenomenal.

00:55:45.801 --> 00:55:47.550
He just tells the story
of him growing up.

00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:51.190
But he plays every single
person in his life.

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.737
And it's on like, on
the snap of a-- or drop

00:55:53.737 --> 00:55:54.820
of a-- what is the phrase?

00:55:54.820 --> 00:55:55.310
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
Yeah, drop of a dime.

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:55.950
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA:
Drop of a dime.

00:55:55.950 --> 00:55:57.900
He's his mother, and then
he's his grandfather,

00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.358
and then he's himself again,
and then, he's his girlfriend.

00:56:00.358 --> 00:56:01.710
And it's insane.

00:56:01.710 --> 00:56:03.300
And I think watching him--

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:04.980
all of his films, growing up--
my parents, for some reason,

00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:06.060
let me watch his films.

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.310
Which I was like,
what are you doing?

00:56:07.310 --> 00:56:07.420
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: Right.

00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:09.630
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: But
like, 15-year-old watching

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:12.270
"To Wong Foo," I was like,
I'm going to be in drag one

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:13.110
day and do that.

00:56:13.110 --> 00:56:14.005
I need to do that.

00:56:14.005 --> 00:56:14.505
He is--

00:56:14.505 --> 00:56:15.810
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART: You
realize when that musical comes

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:16.740
out, you just [? cast ?]
[? yourself. ?]

00:56:16.740 --> 00:56:18.500
ANTHONY LEE MEDINA: From your
mouth to everybody's ears,

00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:19.470
please!

00:56:19.470 --> 00:56:20.220
I'm ready!

00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:22.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:22.580 --> 00:56:24.950
Yeah, he's the one for me.

00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:25.450
Yeah.

00:56:25.450 --> 00:56:27.690
JOANNA JONES: I
think maybe vocally,

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:30.910
like in musical theater, I'd
have to say Audra McDonald

00:56:30.910 --> 00:56:34.950
and Barbra Streisand are the
most striking and just really

00:56:34.950 --> 00:56:38.640
affected me growing up, the
sounds and the excellence

00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:40.580
with which they work at.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:41.970
They're just the top for me.

00:56:41.970 --> 00:56:43.900
And Dame Judi Dench,
oh my goodness.

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:45.733
JAMES MONROE IGLEHART:
[? Word. ?] Yes, yes.

00:56:45.733 --> 00:56:48.129
That was nice.

00:56:48.129 --> 00:56:49.753
Britney Spears-- I'm
just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:56:50.116 --> 00:56:51.491
LEXI LAWSON:
(SINGING) I did it--

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:54.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:54.630 --> 00:57:01.795
You know, when I was growing
up, my parents, they were lucky.

00:57:01.795 --> 00:57:02.670
I didn't bother them.

00:57:02.670 --> 00:57:04.430
I kind of just like--

00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:06.009
they were.

00:57:06.009 --> 00:57:06.800
It was interesting.

00:57:06.800 --> 00:57:08.133
They'd give me "Sound of Music."

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:10.260
And I'd put "Sound
of Music" on repeat,

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:13.200
and do everything that
Julie Andrews was doing.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.700
And then I'd throw
on "Mary Poppins"

00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.900
and do the same exact thing.

00:57:15.900 --> 00:57:18.233
And then I'd invite my friends
over, and get in costume,

00:57:18.233 --> 00:57:20.410
and do them, but
reenact everything.

00:57:20.410 --> 00:57:22.260
And that was me as a kid.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.440
And growing up
multiracial, Mariah Carey

00:57:25.440 --> 00:57:28.450
was also super cool for me.

00:57:28.450 --> 00:57:30.780
But that was my thing.

00:57:30.780 --> 00:57:33.840
I've just been a Broadway
gal since I was little.

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.700
I didn't even know
what Broadway was.

00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:37.951
I was like, oh,
they do what I do?

00:57:37.951 --> 00:57:39.394
