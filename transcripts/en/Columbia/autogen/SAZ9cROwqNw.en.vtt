the hyper complexity of the
 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.480
the hyper complexity of the
post-colonial world and i think it's

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490
post-colonial world and i think it's
 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.719
post-colonial world and i think it's
it's remarkable that that the garden

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729
it's remarkable that that the garden
 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:29.290
it's remarkable that that the garden

of French or Spanish other languages or
 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.710
of French or Spanish other languages or
at least you have to know people who do

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720
at least you have to know people who do

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030
course but it does not mean that events
 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.540
course but it does not mean that events
take place in English or around the

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639
world I think that if wench is a global
 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:03.570
world I think that if wench is a global
language this is not only because of

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580
language this is not only because of
 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.129
language this is not only because of
political events or or geopolitics the

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139
political events or or geopolitics the
 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:12.040
political events or or geopolitics the
fact i was mentioning before but I think

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050
fact i was mentioning before but I think
 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:14.649
fact i was mentioning before but I think
it's also because of more fundamental

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659
it's also because of more fundamental
 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:17.890
it's also because of more fundamental
reasons France and America share a

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900
reasons France and America share a
 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.520
reasons France and America share a
common heritage and of course this has

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530
common heritage and of course this has
 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.980
common heritage and of course this has
to be with the the connection with the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990
to be with the the connection with the
 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.730
to be with the the connection with the
enlightenment values and I saw that Bill

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740

Georgetown University he said that

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469
Georgetown University he said that
 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:41.499
Georgetown University he said that
America is an idea and of course then he

00:05:41.499 --> 00:05:41.509
America is an idea and of course then he
 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.420
America is an idea and of course then he
developed and he said that this idea was

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:43.430
developed and he said that this idea was
 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:45.749
developed and he said that this idea was
freedom and that the shape of America

00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759
freedom and that the shape of America
 

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:50.499
freedom and that the shape of America
was the kind of consequence of idea and

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:50.509
was the kind of consequence of idea and
 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:52.659
was the kind of consequence of idea and
I think that we could say the same about

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669
I think that we could say the same about
 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.779
I think that we could say the same about
France I think that France is an idea to

France I think that France is an idea to
 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:58.180
France I think that France is an idea to
it would not be the same maybe it would

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190
it would not be the same maybe it would
 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.980
it would not be the same maybe it would
have to see more with equality than

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990
have to see more with equality than
 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.040
have to see more with equality than
freedom maybe something more complex

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050
freedom maybe something more complex
 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.430
freedom maybe something more complex
than i could say tonight but i think

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440
than i could say tonight but i think
 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.769
than i could say tonight but i think
that the whole structure of the country

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779
that the whole structure of the country
 

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.680
that the whole structure of the country
and all the relationships between the

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690
and all the relationships between the
 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:15.730
and all the relationships between the
people can be understood as consequences

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740
people can be understood as consequences
 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:19.240
people can be understood as consequences
of ideas as for example the importance

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.250
of ideas as for example the importance
 

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:22.839
of ideas as for example the importance
of the states in forms or many other

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:22.849
of the states in forms or many other
 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:27.380
of the states in forms or many other
things that I mean actual themes

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:27.390
things that I mean actual themes
 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.790
things that I mean actual themes
and for that I think that it makes

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:31.800
and for that I think that it makes
 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.980
and for that I think that it makes

simple idea it's not very sophisticated
 

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.890
simple idea it's not very sophisticated
and everything but it's part of the

french language integrates a part of the

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:23.490
french language integrates a part of the
 

00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:26.450
french language integrates a part of the
world maybe it's not not not a perfect

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460
world maybe it's not not not a perfect
 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.390
world maybe it's not not not a perfect
way of course but it there is a part of

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:29.400
way of course but it there is a part of
 

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:33.410
way of course but it there is a part of
that and if fine if french-language

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:33.420
that and if fine if french-language
 

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.920
that and if fine if french-language
integrates the outside world that means

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930
integrates the outside world that means
 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.800
integrates the outside world that means
that French is a global and coherent

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:39.810
that French is a global and coherent
 

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:43.280
that French is a global and coherent
system and I I dare say a point of view

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:43.290
system and I I dare say a point of view
 

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:49.280
system and I I dare say a point of view
on the world in a light nitin sense then

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:49.290
on the world in a light nitin sense then
 

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:51.350
on the world in a light nitin sense then
the line is had the idea that every

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360
the line is had the idea that every
 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.470
the line is had the idea that every
being was kind of a point of view on the

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:54.480
being was kind of a point of view on the
 

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.740
being was kind of a point of view on the
world and of course some have broader

00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:57.750
world and of course some have broader
 

00:07:57.750 --> 00:08:00.350
world and of course some have broader
than others of course a human being will

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:00.360
than others of course a human being will
 

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.420
than others of course a human being will
have a broader point of view on the

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:02.430
have a broader point of view on the
 

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.480
have a broader point of view on the
world than a tiger for example but every

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:05.490
world than a tiger for example but every
 

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:09.590
world than a tiger for example but every
being has one and I think that French is

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:09.600
being has one and I think that French is
 

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.800
being has one and I think that French is
the global perspective on the world and

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:12.810
the global perspective on the world and
 

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:18.050
the global perspective on the world and
on history so these two countries friend

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:18.060
on history so these two countries friend
 

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.290
on history so these two countries friend
France and America are to global

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:21.300
France and America are to global
 

00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:23.690
France and America are to global
perspectives and the world and I think

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:23.700
perspectives and the world and I think
 

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.240
perspectives and the world and I think
that therefore they have a lot to share

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:26.250
that therefore they have a lot to share
 

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:29.870
that therefore they have a lot to share
on international affairs and on every

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:29.880
on international affairs and on every
 

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:32.900
on international affairs and on every
subject for fundamental reasons and not

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:32.910
subject for fundamental reasons and not
 

00:08:32.910 --> 00:08:37.930
subject for fundamental reasons and not
only for accidental reasons

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:37.940
 
 

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.240
 
people taught English or around the

people taught English or around the
 

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:42.850
people taught English or around the
world it does not mean that people think

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:42.860
world it does not mean that people think
 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:46.120
world it does not mean that people think
in English or around the world and we

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:46.130
in English or around the world and we
 

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:49.360
in English or around the world and we
can communicate in english but i think

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:49.370
can communicate in english but i think
 

00:08:49.370 --> 00:08:52.360
can communicate in english but i think
we cannot insert ourselves into another

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:52.370
we cannot insert ourselves into another
 

00:08:52.370 --> 00:08:55.150
we cannot insert ourselves into another
world view without a certain language

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:55.160
world view without a certain language

world view without a certain language
and even if words are translatable and

00:08:59.610 --> 00:08:59.620
and even if words are translatable and
 

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:02.910
and even if words are translatable and
they are not always by the way but

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:02.920
they are not always by the way but
 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:07.930
they are not always by the way but
thoughts and worldviews are not in the

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:07.940
thoughts and worldviews are not in the
 

00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.250
thoughts and worldviews are not in the
world they exist in the blanks or in the

and these spaces between words are not
 

00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:21.790
and these spaces between words are not
translatable means the difference

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:21.800
translatable means the difference
 

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:25.510
translatable means the difference
between Google and a human soul for

more concretely what is the situation
 

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.340
more concretely what is the situation
now in the US of course we we all heard

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:18.350
now in the US of course we we all heard
 

00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:21.400
now in the US of course we we all heard
and we all had many concerns about the

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.410
and we all had many concerns about the
 

00:11:21.410 --> 00:11:24.400
and we all had many concerns about the
situations especially for example in

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:24.410
situations especially for example in
 

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:31.300
situations especially for example in
Albany and yeah the initial plan was to

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:31.310
Albany and yeah the initial plan was to
 

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.689
Albany and yeah the initial plan was to
this activate or dismantle the the whole

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:34.699

French department there and i went there
and told to his president Philip of

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:40.310
and told to his president Philip of
 

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:44.050
and told to his president Philip of
French of SUNY Albany and it's plain

00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:44.060
French of SUNY Albany and it's plain
 

00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:48.699
French of SUNY Albany and it's plain
that the reasons were all more than

00:11:48.699 --> 00:11:48.709
that the reasons were all more than
 

00:11:48.709 --> 00:11:51.460
that the reasons were all more than
everything else financial because of the

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:51.470
everything else financial because of the
 

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.680
everything else financial because of the
budget codes and cuts and everything you

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:53.690
budget codes and cuts and everything you
 

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:59.500
budget codes and cuts and everything you
already know and we proposed to try and

00:11:59.500 --> 00:11:59.510
already know and we proposed to try and
 

00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:03.160
already know and we proposed to try and
enhance the number to try and help

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:03.170
enhance the number to try and help
 

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:06.340
enhance the number to try and help
enhance the number of french student

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:06.350
enhance the number of french student
 

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:09.670
enhance the number of french student
there because it's always a key for the

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680
there because it's always a key for the
 

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.939
there because it's always a key for the
protection of French departments and we

00:12:12.939 --> 00:12:12.949
protection of French departments and we
 

00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:15.430
protection of French departments and we
learnt as I'm sure you learn to the few

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440
learnt as I'm sure you learn to the few
 

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.430
learnt as I'm sure you learn to the few
years a few days ago that finally they

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:18.440
years a few days ago that finally they
 

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:21.639
years a few days ago that finally they
will keep the minors in French that we

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:21.649
will keep the minors in French that we
 

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:24.129
will keep the minors in French that we
did not keep the majors in French

00:12:24.129 --> 00:12:24.139
did not keep the majors in French
 

00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:28.269
did not keep the majors in French
unfortunately the this is the bad point

00:12:28.269 --> 00:12:28.279
unfortunately the this is the bad point
 

00:12:28.279 --> 00:12:30.790
unfortunately the this is the bad point
but the good point is that the tip the

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:30.800
but the good point is that the tip the
 

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.790
but the good point is that the tip the
minor and therefore there will still be

00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:33.800
minor and therefore there will still be
 

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:37.629
minor and therefore there will still be
a French department so we take that as a

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639
a French department so we take that as a
 

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:40.449
a French department so we take that as a
starting point and from this point we

00:12:40.449 --> 00:12:40.459
starting point and from this point we
 

00:12:40.459 --> 00:12:44.679
starting point and from this point we
will try to help this department to

00:12:44.679 --> 00:12:44.689
will try to help this department to
 

00:12:44.689 --> 00:12:47.530
will try to help this department to
increase the number of French students

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:47.540
increase the number of French students
 

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.530
increase the number of French students
so this is an example maybe a night when

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:50.540
so this is an example maybe a night when
 

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:53.019
so this is an example maybe a night when
it example but the situation is kind of

00:12:53.019 --> 00:12:53.029
it example but the situation is kind of
 

00:12:53.029 --> 00:12:56.110
it example but the situation is kind of
paradox here because there is an

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:56.120
paradox here because there is an
 

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.030
paradox here because there is an
increasing of the number of students who

00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040
increasing of the number of students who
 

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.360
increasing of the number of students who
are studying French in the US this

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.370
are studying French in the US this
 

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:03.689
are studying French in the US this
increasing is five percentage here and

00:13:03.689 --> 00:13:03.699
increasing is five percentage here and
 

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:05.220
increasing is five percentage here and
in the

00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:05.230
in the
 

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:08.120
in the
same time there is a big increasing of

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:08.130
same time there is a big increasing of
 

00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.590
same time there is a big increasing of
collaborations between French and

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:10.600
collaborations between French and
 

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.430
collaborations between French and
American universities in all disciplines

00:13:13.430 --> 00:13:13.440
American universities in all disciplines
 

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.200
American universities in all disciplines
from French literature to

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:16.210
from French literature to
 

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:21.230
from French literature to
nanotechnologies or history on biology

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:21.240
nanotechnologies or history on biology
 

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:24.870
nanotechnologies or history on biology
even at the highest believer we are

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880
even at the highest believer we are
 

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.890
even at the highest believer we are
talking about a lot of dual degrees and

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:28.900
talking about a lot of dual degrees and
 

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:35.840
talking about a lot of dual degrees and
even dual phd's 707 thousand articles

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:35.850
 
 

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:40.620
 
have been co-written and cosine by

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:40.630
have been co-written and cosine by
 

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:43.680
have been co-written and cosine by
French and American strollers so the

00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:43.690
French and American strollers so the
 

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:46.520
French and American strollers so the
situation of collaborations between

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:46.530
situation of collaborations between
 

00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:49.020
situation of collaborations between
French and American universities is

00:13:49.020 --> 00:13:49.030
French and American universities is
 

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:50.520
French and American universities is
rather good and we have a lot of

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:50.530
rather good and we have a lot of
 

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:56.460
rather good and we have a lot of
instruments helping this increasing as a

instruments helping this increasing as a
 

00:13:56.470 --> 00:14:00.840
instruments helping this increasing as a

00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:00.850
puf we can talk of that later maybe in
 

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:04.320
puf we can talk of that later maybe in
the questions and at the same time there

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:04.330
the questions and at the same time there
 

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.760
the questions and at the same time there
is a threat on many French departments

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:08.770
is a threat on many French departments
 

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:12.440
is a threat on many French departments
in the u.s. because of project codes and

in the u.s. because of project codes and

also humanities that somehow are

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:36.700
also humanities that somehow are
 

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.060
also humanities that somehow are
threatened in the u.s. University so we

00:14:39.060 --> 00:14:39.070
threatened in the u.s. University so we
 

00:14:39.070 --> 00:14:40.890
threatened in the u.s. University so we
don't take it personally but it doesn't

00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:40.900
don't take it personally but it doesn't
 

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:42.900
don't take it personally but it doesn't
mean that we don't have to do we don't

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:42.910
mean that we don't have to do we don't
 

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.680
mean that we don't have to do we don't
have to react and I heard many people

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:46.690
have to react and I heard many people
 

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:49.440
have to react and I heard many people
asking if it was important in this

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:49.450
asking if it was important in this
 

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:52.770
asking if it was important in this
context to keep french departments and

00:14:52.770 --> 00:14:52.780
context to keep french departments and
 

00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:54.480
context to keep french departments and
French studies in the universities and

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:54.490
French studies in the universities and
 

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:56.910
French studies in the universities and
people are doing that as there are many

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:56.920
people are doing that as there are many
 

00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.830
people are doing that as there are many
collaborations in sciences and

00:14:58.830 --> 00:14:58.840
collaborations in sciences and
 

00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.630
collaborations in sciences and
everything it might prove that we don't

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:00.640
everything it might prove that we don't
 

00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.540
everything it might prove that we don't
need it and I think that we really need

00:15:03.540 --> 00:15:03.550
need it and I think that we really need
 

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:07.730
need it and I think that we really need
it and I mean what would be an important

00:15:07.730 --> 00:15:07.740
it and I mean what would be an important
 

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.530
it and I mean what would be an important

without any math department it wouldn't

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:28.250
without any math department it wouldn't
 

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.449
without any math department it wouldn't
and I think that it is because math is

00:15:31.449 --> 00:15:31.459
and I think that it is because math is
 

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:34.090
and I think that it is because math is
the language is the language of sciences

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.100
the language is the language of sciences
 

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.460
the language is the language of sciences
and I think that it's the common point

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:36.470
and I think that it's the common point
 

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.920
and I think that it's the common point
between french and math there are both

00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:38.930
between french and math there are both
 

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:42.519
between french and math there are both

that every ethnologist would have to

that every ethnologist would have to
 

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:06.160
that every ethnologist would have to
speak French of course but I think that

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:06.170
speak French of course but I think that
 

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:09.960
speak French of course but I think that
it is important that some of them do and

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:09.970
it is important that some of them do and
 

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.509
it is important that some of them do and
that they could talk of literature and

00:16:13.509 --> 00:16:13.519
that they could talk of literature and
 

00:16:13.519 --> 00:16:16.030
that they could talk of literature and

an isolated field of learning and I

00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:25.189
an isolated field of learning and I
 

00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:28.660
an isolated field of learning and I
think that the the French department of

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:28.670
think that the the French department of
 

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:32.019
think that the the French department of

00:16:32.029 --> 00:16:37.120
Columbia is is really the perfect
example of of this here I understood

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:37.130
example of of this here I understood
 

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:41.620
example of of this here I understood
that every French stroller a very French

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:41.630

department of Columbia University it

00:16:48.759 --> 00:16:48.769
department of Columbia University it
 

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:51.639
department of Columbia University it
could be history or ethnology and so and

could be history or ethnology and so and
 

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:55.840
could be history or ethnology and so and
so and it's of course very very clever

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:55.850
so and it's of course very very clever
 

00:16:55.850 --> 00:16:58.660
so and it's of course very very clever
and very important to do so because it

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:58.670
and very important to do so because it
 

00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.090
and very important to do so because it
protects French department and it shows

00:17:03.090 --> 00:17:03.100

in the US 24 forge this kind of links
 

00:17:22.159 --> 00:17:26.740
in the US 24 forge this kind of links
because these links give value to French

00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:26.750
because these links give value to French
 

00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:28.870
because these links give value to French
departments and protect them

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:28.880
