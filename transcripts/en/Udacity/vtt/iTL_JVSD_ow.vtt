00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.460
It's as simple as adding a correctly linked .constructor property to that

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.689
prototype object.

00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:10.090
Now, lookups for .constructor property would fall through from amy and

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.400
stop when they hit Van.prototype.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.620
They'll report the right constructor because Van.prototype.constructor has been

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.430
set to equal Van.
