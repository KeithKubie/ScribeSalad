Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So then if we can introduce this, how would you convince the many people listening to stay listening? Cause it's a great story. It doesn't matter that it's figure skating. It's like a really good story. It's a good story that like pops off of. It's like, Hey, I'm Jad, I bring Ron, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and La. I've never been a huge fan of figure skating. But like this story I think asks a really interesting question. The question would be, what if you with all your heart wanted to be the best at something, but the persons who judge, what's the best at this? Something you want to do, don't share the best with your sense of business. So you do your best and their best and your best are different and now you can't best it out. What do you do? What do you do? Story comes from our producer, Latif Nasser and also producer Tracy Hunt. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. Okay, so let's start then. So okay, so we're starting in 1998 we're at the Olympics in Nagano in Japan, Japan. And so we've seen warming up on the ice. You have this woman, this figure Skater Serea Bonnelly how do you spell? Yeah. S. U. R. Y. A. She's French, 24 years old. She's flat

Speaker 2:          01:10          less than five times European champion, but all sorts of problems, particularly injury problems.

Speaker 1:          01:15          She's got an Achilles tendon that's been stitched together, hold a muscle. He's on painkillers and [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          01:21          he did for France in 1994 and just missed the podium.

Speaker 1:          01:24          Never metal with the Olympics before. This is her, probably her last go, um, in, in front of the world. But France, there is Suria bodily and it was during this performance that's [inaudible] fondly did something that had never been done by anyone. Anyone ever. And you could either see it as a, as a kind of middle finger to the establishment, like this huge SFU

Speaker 2:          01:53          or

Speaker 1:          01:59          just this beautiful moment of self affirmation.

Speaker 3:          02:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:07          what'd she do? Uh, we'll get there. Hello. Hello. How are you doing? Pretty good. Thanks. I laughed out loud when I, when I heard you say that you would call me on your Zamboni break. I know it was like this. The only time. Okay. So to really understand just the context of all this and the stakes of that, that moment, we got to go all the way back. So. So how did you, how did you first get into skating? Well, I did start skating because of my mom actually. So Suria was actually adopted as a baby by this white couple in the south of France. She grew up in Nice. My mom was a sport coach and she was able to be a, like a volunteer for a gymnastic club and skating club. So even though I was small, tiny, tiny, um, she just put me on the eyes and say, hey, just hang around

Speaker 4:          03:00          and chill on the ice and you know, and I spend lots of hours there just waiting for my mom and one day I go find out that's a hat, you know, some skidding boots who fit me. And she started skating. Yeah. Fortunately I was good at it. Pretty soon she had a coach from the local ring, I guess a coach can have called and having a meeting with your parents. Say, Hey, you know, it'd be nice if you could come like two times a week, probably may now. We'll be nice. We'll do maybe four times a week. Well, how about every day it was like, okay, here we go. And so by the age of 10 she decides she wants to spend her life figure skating. It was my dream to, you know, to do it. And I know I can. So she would go to these ice shows like holiday or nice.

Speaker 2:          03:44          So when this is a show, I love being, I love showtime and just, you know, those fantastical students, she would see all these famous skaters dotting my i's guru on those skaters. They would just be flying through the air. It was like amazing. And she would go to practice and she would practice all of the things she saw, all the, the double axles and the triple pill loops and speed jumps and that sal cows and the double sal cows and the, you know, quadruple double the triple action.

Speaker 4:          04:12          Do you have any idea what you're saying right now? No, no, no. These are all just words to me. It was very fast that every week, every month you can see a difference. And speaking of difference, you know, if we fast forward a little bit

Speaker 2:          04:26          and here she is on the world stage, sorry, urban la in 1989

Speaker 4:          04:31          when she appears at the world champion,

Speaker 2:          04:35          the thing that becomes really apparent is that

Speaker 4:          04:37          she is different. Yeah. Because I was black so I was like people like what? Oh, French black. So I'm black and I definitely remember when she was a baptist skate, my mom would be like, the black girl was skating. So we all had to like pay attention. And so people saw to whom

Speaker 1:          04:57          you can of curious, this girl is very different than Oh, it was, um, it was arrested. That's done at Howard. He new writer for espn.com Obama Lee is a striking and exotic figure on the ice. She, you just arrested your eyes when she skated. The, the contrast of her skin on the ice was beautiful.

Speaker 5:          05:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          05:17          and then there were these fanciful stories that sprung up about where she came from. We are now taking you about as far away from the skating world as possible. Pretty much as soon as she hit the scene and you started hearing these rumors that she had been adopted from a coconut strewn beach in reunion island off the coast of Madagascar

Speaker 2:          05:37          and unlikely place to find it. World-Class figures, candor. Right. And

Speaker 1:          05:40          that she had, um, that she, what was it though to us here, here that she never cut her hair, cut her hair since her birth, that she existed on a diet of bird seed and you know, all these things. Yeah. Id like 60 some kind of black forest princess or exactly. Exactly.

Speaker 6:          05:58          Yes. Suria says, you know, at that age she really didn't know too much about what was going on. I know as a kid I was like, whatever my coach deal, it's, you know, he's the one who speak English. See, you're barely speak English. She was barely 16. She wants to live a young baby. I, you know, I did talk to the Guy who was coaching her at the time, this guy named DDA Guy Gay and, and he told me he planted these stories. We use the press very well. Wait, what? He said that he made up the beach thing. He made up the hair thing because he was trying to, she was a star. And what are you willing to hear stories, right? So we made some stars, some good ones. Do you know what I mean? I'm just saying that we making up stories because you want to hear them. That is just creeped out. Yeah, you're absolutely right. It's Shitty as hell. I can kind of see where he was going because what he was trying to do with that, he was trying to present her to the world as this like radically new kind of skater because female skating at that moment

Speaker 4:          07:00          where Nice, cute girls, especially for ladies, they like to keep the girls parading hours for Catarina. So it's famous skater like Katharina with the ravishing Karina or Sonya Haney is, we're like totally like woman, you know, pretty graceful. Who makes those men's, you know crazy. When you were watching it's, you know, they were also,

Speaker 6:          07:23          why would I say they? They had a certain conception of females. Katie, we didn't have the same one and it wasn't just that she looked different. She also skied it different. Lee, it was a totally different approach. Suria was always very like

Speaker 7:          07:44          [inaudible] explosive ladies and gentlemen. Elvis Stojko is in the building, retired world figure skating champion and met three at junior's 1990 for me it was sort of a new, a new face on

Speaker 8:          07:55          same part is the the like the fresh stick of Yom tiny 15 year old French girl who's captured everyone's imagination here.

Speaker 6:          08:03          Say a Tonya Harding style skating. She was just so exciting and there was just no boundaries for her.

Speaker 7:          08:08          This is Tonya Harding and she and surreal,

Speaker 6:          08:12          the strength and the power. She'd step on the ice and yeah,

Speaker 8:          08:17          people were crazy too. Yeah. She strike a pose and then just take off. Suria would go from one end to the other speed across the ice line across the room with powerful stroking, her opening at triple lights in a triple tall. She comes early into these jobs, soaring through the air with powerful spin, NTT jump back jump. That really was a cool combination after combination other dreadful, I prefer to hit a triple, triple jump. Then just to do a pretty spray goal and she would attack everything. That's a very first step. Secrets she had the stepping,

Speaker 2:          08:56          the gliding through running. Okay. She had an all talent and the crowd here. I appreciate it is such jumping ability and there's no end to what she might achieve. Side of competitions. You could do these ice shows and exhibitions

Speaker 1:          09:18          and that's when you would see like what she can really do. Just do all kinds of other jumps that weren't even allowed in competence, you know, didn't backflips she would do that. Yes. That slips very first time that I ever saw her do a back flip. I mean I just, my mouth just dropped open. That's tiny Harding again. I was like, how did you do that? Because it's really dangerous. Elvis Stojko told us that one time he tried it and it did not go well. I came down right on my face and I split my eye open and almost broke my neck and I was just like, you know what? I don't think this is going to be a good thing. You know, this little teenage girl cerea bodily, no problem. Just doing it like it was nothing. Absolutely fearless. And the crowd loved it. People like

Speaker 2:          09:57          Dunlop is south making noise and tubs or fits into the ground. I can feel the lugs, a whole grueling building. I'm like, I swear it looks like an earthquake, but

Speaker 1:          10:08          here's what happened. And this is where things kind of get confusing as Syria blows up and all these people who never liked figure skating fall in love with her over and over,

Speaker 2:          10:19          the judges don't artistic impression. And you just see disparity from the judges and the crowd. You're not like the mark

Speaker 1:          10:29          subset. No doubt. Even when she doesn't get high scores, no tears begin to flow happen all the time. I escaped. Good. But somehow I, it's not for me.

Speaker 9:          10:43          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          10:44          so the judging system and figure skating goes from zero to six and on Syria's artistic marks, she would get scores like five zero five zero five ones. Yeah, you get your low fives, which like sounds like it's a good mark, but that's not a good,

Speaker 9:          10:59          there he is. What did you think of those Meyer? Very, very disappointed. [inaudible] never mind.

Speaker 1:          11:09          What'd you say there? She said, nevermind. That's life. I'm used to it. I fought it. Sue Sports sports mean challenge every day. I try to do the best that I could do. You do your best is fine, but clearly there were some times where I got hurt. There was this one time we found on youtube where she, she boozed the judges after she gets her score crowd is bullying. Well we said why was she getting bad marks to begin with? What was the, what was the problem? Well, that's the question and it's kind of complicated. I think there's several things. I'm Janet Howard, that ESPN writer. She says, the first thing you got to know, and just to take a quick little dive into the Weirdo world figure skating bucks dive, is that there's this

Speaker 4:          11:54          fundamental tension in the sport of figure skating between artistry on one side in athleticism on the other and powerfulness [inaudible] readiness. They want these people to look like little ballerinas, but leap into these jumps like predators. And at the time, skating was sort of locked in this loud and fractious debate about what do we want to be. And Suria was sort of the epitome of almost the end point. What could happen if somebody with unrivaled athleticism and no aversion to risk was willing to go after it. And I think there were a lot of people in skating that didn't want it. I went through it. I know all about it

Speaker 1:          12:34          now. Tonya Harding, she said that she had this issue. I didn't want to skate like what they wanted skating to look like Elvis Stojko to butt. In Maria's case, there's a lot of work to be done on the choreography yet there's a lot of work to be done on the grace. Oh those words used to criticize her skating. There's a lot through to who fixed. I'd like to see your stop jumping for six months in women's escape.

Speaker 4:          12:55          We're just a little bit more loaded.

Speaker 1:          12:57          They would say things like, oh, we're all tied up in a different, it's a lot of raw talent but it's not a, it's not fully kind of hasn't been refined and, and it's for us like non skaters. Like that's been one of the challenges of this story I guess is like trying to see like is that a legit criticism?

Speaker 4:          13:16          Alright. Is this just a way of saying that sees black? They chose racism. I have the courage to say it because she was black.

Speaker 1:          13:25          So this is Marie Ren Laguna and she is a former French figure skating official. And She was part of a team whose job it was to decide which girls to send to the, uh, world junior championship.

Speaker 4:          13:35          And then we have to choose to only two girls. And we had three possibilities. She said that she backed serea and the majority of the people didn't, didn't want them. Black Skaters. Um, were they saying it out loud? Look, we don't want somebody, we don't want her because she's black. It was very [inaudible]. In fact, according to her, what they would say, she, they would say the kind of things like she was too muscular or she wasn't elegant enough. Oh yes. I have to say that's word. Elegance. Many times I have heard that word and she's got to elegant.

Speaker 1:          14:10          Marie [inaudible] is an outsider in the figure skating world these days because of an unrelated scandal. And so we weren't totally sure what to think about that. But wait, how did Ceria feel about all this? Well, I asked her, did you feel like any of the difficulty was because you're black? No, I feel like any of it was about race. No, no, no, no, no, no. But then moments later she said,

Speaker 4:          14:31          well, you know, when you block, you know, everybody knows that you have to do better than anybody else who's white. Well, I think the idea that she was held back in Martin, her marks for any other reason other than the quality of your skating, I think is incorrect. That Sandra, I'm been

Speaker 6:          14:52          involved in the skating world my whole life as a competitor, as an Olympian, a commentator, and actually as a commentator I'd like to see him stop jumping for six months and living to skate. She was kind of hard on Syria. Yes. And when we asked her why, this is what she said, everything about skating is built on circles. The radius could be huge, but it's still a circle. Everything is about edges and leaning into those edges and leaning into the turns and and carving massive circles on the ice. And that is our sport, which leads to Syria. I mean if you watch your jumps there, they were on straight lines and if a jump is on a straight line, then it can't land with flow because the idea is to land your jump with as much speed and flow as you had going into it.

Speaker 6:          15:45          And that's something that she couldn't do because she was jumping on straight lines. And then the other thing about skating that you don't necessarily get on camera is the sound of the edge, the sound of, of a beautiful skater going from edge to edge, from lean to lean. What does that sound bad? It's, it's a beautiful sound. It's a sound that we all love. It's a, it's a, it's a gentle carving. Um, image. Clean sound in my head is like, like a hockey stock. But that's probably not the, no, no, no, no, because there's no there. I can tell you there are no scratches. It's a glide.

Speaker 6:          16:35          It's just a, it's a ham. I, Gosh, I wish I had a good word to describe it. And there are different sounds. I mean, like there's the sound of Brian Boitano, his back crossovers that, you know, used to like excite me when I was in the rink with them. But then there's also sort of the gentle, almost soundless, um, quality of say a UK Asato or a Katia Gordeeva, um, where they're like a whisper across the ice. And yet they're, you know, flipping from one edge to another edge. Um, and, and forward to backward. And it's almost, it's just that this glide, um, I haven't got a good word for it. Yam. So when, when Suria was skating, would she have that sound? No, she would be

Speaker 10:         17:23          scratchy

Speaker 6:          17:30          male, we should say. That wasn't the sound of Ceria skating or any of those other people. We just like miked up a whole bunch of like pretty good finger skaters. Were they professional skaters? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. These are legit scares figure skaters. And we sent the clip to Sandra and she was like, yes. So she gave you the thumbs up that we get it right? Yep. Let's see.

Speaker 1:          17:50          I don't necessarily hear whatever it is she is hearing and think. Yes. I mean they sound different but not even that different really. So that's exactly the problem. Uh, ice skating is largely

Speaker 11:         18:00          about aesthetics. So as far as sports go, it's, it's like kind of in its own category. Like if you're talking about Serena Williams who's facing a lot of these same kinds of criticisms, it doesn't matter. There's a line on a court and it's either inside or outside, there are rules, whereas there aren't these rules. When it comes to beauty, it's, it's super slushy

Speaker 1:          18:22          and that makes someone like Sareah much more vulnerable. So. So what ended up happening? Well after a couple of years of getting these kinds of marks, does she eat, does some soul searching? I mean I was a bit more mature in 1992 at the age of 18 I had new curl grad changed my whole skating walls, you know, I change cultures and she decides to take the note. She actually travels to California and works with Frank Carroll who's like this legendary American coach. And what she's doing is that she's trying to, you know, be more graceful, more beautiful, more elegantly, more circley. Yeah. And after that you kind of see a difference. You can watch the youtube videos from that period and it, it's like she's a different skater, Huh? Yeah. Does it work yet? In 1993 in the world championships, she comes in second and then by the time 1994 rolls around, she is a favorite. She is, she is probably gonna win. And what happens? Things take a really strange turn. We'll be back right after the same buddy break.

Speaker 12:         19:52          [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 13:         19:53          hi there. This is Kirsten recording from Orlando, Florida. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 1:          20:13          this is Radiolab. Uh, let's get back to our story about Suria bodily or Bernali as it said in French from producers, Tracy Hunt and lot of Nasser. I, I was, I was, I'm really curious what, what happened at that, at that metal ceremony in 1994, um, oh, as a Walsh in between the world champion, not the Isaacs. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Well, we had this water and been shipped in Japan,

Speaker 12:         20:38          seven Olympic titles, 17 world championship.

Speaker 1:          20:41          Just to set this up, the world championships or the second most important event in figure skating after the Olympics and at the Olympics. Richard, just a month before the top three ladies, 16 year old Oksana Baiul Oxana by Yoga Gold Nancy Kerrigan. It's just fancy care. Again, got silver. 10 Lou got the bronze and fourth plays with Ceria. Now those top three ladies, Oxana, Nancy Lou out of the picture, out of the picture for various reasons and juries and some turn pro and stuff, but whatever the point is at these rural championships, the the, the highway had been cleared for Maria. She was going to take it. It was hers.

Speaker 2:          21:22          Take us through her winning season. Will it be gold? So jumping

Speaker 1:          21:27          forward to the final day of the championship, Suria is in second place. She takes the 80 years old from Nice in the south of France, starts their program.

Speaker 8:          21:40          [inaudible] immediately starts with this double axle that's very incredible. After that is just triple, triple, triple, triple, triple. And that man was still [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          21:51          It was just one of the best skates of her life. I knew I did my best, I did everything. It was not perfect because nobody's perfect but pretty good come to competition overall. Eventually after about four and a half

Speaker 2:          22:02          minutes, she finishes her skate or you're going to lay the ball days for seasons loads and loads of technical difficulty. The question is how will I see her artistic effort goes over,

Speaker 1:          22:17          ah, off to the side, to a bench with her coach, um, to await her result. [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          22:26          technically called narrow and some five nines at plays or those are as high as any we've seen.

Speaker 1:          22:38          When she gets her marks, she jumps into first place and, and, and there's only one skater left. It's a skater who usually finishes below I in competitions. You could sato again, that's Sandra Bezac. We all know you could skate it. She's the kind of scary that puts a smile on your face. And UCO was, you know, one of these really lyrical skaters making his return. Elvis Stojko and Yuca had it had this

Speaker 2:          23:04          very beautiful style and grace give her skating

Speaker 1:          23:08          gentle, almost soundless quality like a whisper across the ice. Basically heard skating style was the exact opposite end of the spectrum from Syria's

Speaker 2:          23:21          Todd, the 21 year old from Tokyo. This is

Speaker 1:          23:24          so she gets up

Speaker 8:          23:27          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          23:27          what does her final skate in front of the home crowd?

Speaker 8:          23:30          You guys, one of my favorite skaters, but she doesn't have the combination jump like finally did. So she's going to need all her jumps opening up in their triple lips and she,

Speaker 2:          23:41          it's

Speaker 1:          23:41          first gen crowd loves it. Should it go? She, she had maybe less triples than me, but she was maybe poor, prettier, and in her routine there were these moments where it just looks like she was just sort of skipping across the ice. Just very balletic moves. I know she's good and all

Speaker 2:          23:59          they stand as one here at Mako Hari Events Center for the local favorite Yuca Sato. Now it's down to the judges as to whether the gold metal belongs to Sato of Japan or Bono. Leo France. You could, you know, get off the ice. She goes to wait for her marks. First marks, of course, her technical merit bone Elise soco stated in jumps so well and every one of those marks except the finish judge goat Juke Bona. She wins eight out of nine technical merit.

Speaker 1:          24:35          But when it came down to the artistic mark,

Speaker 2:          24:37          it's just the opposite. Then the technical marks, eight or nine judges all but the French judge giving her higher marks. Those go to you. Casada this is going to be close. It actually ends up being a tie.

Speaker 1:          24:52          So it goes to being a tiebreaker and that's been the, the judges basically pick first, second and third. And in a five, four decision,

Speaker 2:          25:02          she's [inaudible] world champion for sure. The trues Hearn ought to the dressing room or the new champion, she'll be back. And so will we.

Speaker 1:          25:18          What happens next is one of these moments that really defines serious story for a lot of people. So what happened was that

Speaker 2:          25:25          right,

Speaker 1:          25:27          right after all the results were out, they set up the medal ceremony. They called out the skaters, they first called out Yuca she comes out from this tunnel backstage onto the ice.

Speaker 2:          25:38          What a moment wades smiles at everybody. And then after about a minute, we had one about the silver medalist. He called out Syria [inaudible] and where is the European champion? All the cameras crowding around. And uh, she didn't come out, not immediately, a late arrival. And here she comes,

Speaker 1:          26:06          she skates out onto the ice. She waves but her face isn't smiling. No. And then when she gets to the podium, she congratulates you. Casado but then finally has chosen not to stand on the podium. She just stopped before getting on the podium. She just stood right next to the podium.

Speaker 2:          26:26          I think this is a form of protest. I really hope she doesn't go to with this. You wouldn't

Speaker 1:          26:32          stand on it. She was crying. Elvis actually was in the crowd watching. I felt bad for her cause I know what she was going through where you know, you out skated your competitor and they just wouldn't give it to you. And I was like Sareah just get on the podium. Take the metal.

Speaker 2:          26:48          The international skating union presidents hold off the a ticker skating official who's giving up the metals he gives you good. The gold puts it around her neck, but then when he turns to, yeah,

Speaker 1:          27:02          he just sort of stands there. Looks at her. He says something but you can't hear what it is. She shakes her head. He puts the metal around Sabrina's neck, shakes her hand, and then he holds onto her hand and just kind of like, he's her onto the podium.

Speaker 2:          27:19          This is a first she takes off the metal. Yeah, sure. She, she takes the silver metal off of her head

Speaker 1:          27:38          like, oh my God, Holy Shit, he's actually doing this. It was huge. It was a huge, it was a huge deal. The camera zooms in on her face and she is just weeping. Oh, what's going on inside that young man?

Speaker 4:          27:51          Yes. [inaudible] so after the medal ceremony is over, she just gets mob

Speaker 8:          28:02          by report. Why did you not accept the metal? What was the problem? Because men, my face [inaudible] they unfair to use sir. Yeah. What I, the judges unfair to you today? Do you feel you were robbed tonight? Is that what you're saying? Did you deserve the gold medal? Syria. And eventually what she says is, I'm just not lucky.

Speaker 4:          28:30          I'm just not lucky. What, what was going on? Like what happened? You had a feeling it was more like a point I'll say, is this, is it? Stop now. You know, and you put your, your face on, on a, on a table. Is it okay? No enough is enough. That's it. And say, Hey, you know, I'm not dumb and I'm just getting sick and now I'm sick of it. I keep my eyes open is that it's not fair. We has asked has to stop. I know. It was just so depressing and it was so not fair. Mostly it was not fair and about, it felt unfair. Joseph Suno up and over and over so many times. That's every time. It's never me because whatever I can do, how many triple I can be pretty. It can have as the best choreographer I can show everything was made to be on a top and still I'm like, what do you need more of me to do at this point? You know how many troubleshoot all you want me? If I don't, do you kill me? And if I do, you don't care in any way. You took somebody, you choose somebody else. Don't you think that that's a little unsportsmanlike? Yeah, totally. Absolutely. Yeah. But if she, all these other girls have been worked just as hard as she has one presumed.

Speaker 1:          29:35          Sure. But okay, so picture yourself. If you're at that position, you're, you're in that position. You find yourself second second. You feel like you're not, you're not. She came in second. That's always, so the margin was so close. It was so close. I think it is close. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          29:51          Can I like it? Yeah. Yeah. Google. Um, I, I just more like felt empathy for her, for her. I can't imagine what it must be like. Well, I can't imagine what it must be like, but I, you know, in that kind of, on that scale to be the only one and there is this, um, I think for, you know, a friend of mine once told me that racism can make black people crazy, which is very, very broad way of looking at it in the sense that you kind of almost never know why people are reacting to you the way that they do. And it's, and it's kind of, you're always sort of second guessing, you know, was that, you know, did, did, did they, oh, that guy just came in and he said hi to everybody in the room. But he did say to me, what does that, what was that about?

Speaker 6:          30:45          And so there's no obvious thing about it, but it, it can make you feel a little paranoid, a little crazy. Now, I cannot put myself, I can't imagine what, how, you know, Suria felt in that moment, but I didn't necessarily like think that, you know, these prejudice people had denied her this. If anything, I felt more like, man, it Maly must suck to be the only black woman skating at that kind of level and not really understand why things are happening or maybe it must be like a very confusing situation to be in. And that is, and, and it was more like empathy. I don't know, you know, if, if, if it, there was racism, quite frankly. UCO Saddo is an amazing skater. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          31:35          Well I think you're right. It's very legitimate

Speaker 14:         31:37          to feel like you can't quit your finger on this feeling, which

Speaker 1:          31:44          never goes away. No. And never

Speaker 14:         31:47          resolves and is always there and always makes you feel weird.

Speaker 1:          31:54          Happens. What happens after the A, that's our producer Matt Kielty after the ceremony. I think the, I think the, the, the rep that she got after this moment was that she was a sore loser and that she was defiant, that she had a bad attitude. And does she, uh, quit at this point or no, she keeps going. She, she competed again in the real championships in 1995 the very next year. And she came in second again, again for three years in a row in a similar pattern. Was there like, just the one sort of, that one wasn't as close, but she was second again for the third year. She's getting a lot of other competitions after 95 or

Speaker 6:          32:30          I think the various, you know, European championships, you know, Skate America. So

Speaker 1:          32:35          yeah, she was doing a lot or she never wins. Not The Olympics. Not at the world

Speaker 4:          32:40          championships. No. So she never gets first. Oh, what? I guess it depends on how you define first. What do you mean? Oh, you'll see. So that actually takes us right back to the beginning.

Speaker 12:         32:54          We're here

Speaker 1:          32:55          live at 10:00 AM on Saturday morning in Japan. So to be forward, rewind, we're in Nagano, Japan, 1998 Winter Olympics. I knew he was my last Olympics, last major, major, big competition and everything was fine until the day before the short program. I, uh, I pull a muscle,

Speaker 4:          33:16          her left leg, and I couldn't lift. I couldn't do anything to make matters worse. Ceria at that moment was already recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon. People had to leave to carry me to walk stairs because I couldn't get stairs. So they'd have to lift me to go to my room because, you know, at the Olympic village I couldn't walk.

Speaker 4:          33:35          You know, even I'm broken, I'm damaged. I'm like, used cars as ready. Good. Good for like for trash. Oh. Like, you know, Raleigh, I was so messed up between my legs and my Achilles. I was like, no, it's the disaster. And the doctors say, maybe we should withdraw. I'm like, no, I'm already here. You know, I don't want to dress. Maybe retires. My, probably my last completion. I don't want to just retire like that. Just to give them anything you can. Yeah. I have to keep going. And so on the final day, she says that she, you know, between Medici massage, acupuncture appeals, she goes back out on the ice

Speaker 1:          34:11          that is now getting ready to skate for her country. She's in this golden blue sequined outfit and she starts her routine. You can tell she's favoring one leg, but she manages to land. The two jumps didn't work. Can you say, okay, then

Speaker 12:         34:28          false.

Speaker 1:          34:32          She gets back up, keeps going through her routine. There's the triple sale code, and then she says, she just got to this point where she just knew she couldn't do it. It was so much in pain and Josie and I was a program. I was supposed to go to more triple and I say, no, what? I'm not good. I don't feel it. I know I'm gonna crush. Um, I can do, I'm not capable. My leg is not with me anymore. And then what comes to her is that there is this move that she has in her repertoire that you can do, but it's illegal. [inaudible] a special thing in my backpack and say, Hey, I can't do it. It's my last, it's my last come to show this all going through your mind as you were skating. Yeah. Oh yeah, totally. You know me, it's like a computer who know if I would have missed something or jump as, okay, here I can fit a triple here. Obviously I can do a combo triple, triple. I know I need to fit something. You're like the GPS lady. You're like recalculating. Yeah, totally rerouting. Okay. Renewed. Do we have to know right now? So in her rerouting, she turns around from skating forwards. The skating backwards picks up speed just like she's about to do a triple. But

Speaker 12:         35:36          yeah,

Speaker 4:          35:39          she does eat backflip but not any old back flip. She's swings one leg over. Does the splits in the air upside down? Yeah. And then

Speaker 10:         35:49          lands on one foot. [inaudible] stop. When you do

Speaker 4:          36:02          the backflip, do you go, do your skates, go up towards the ceiling and then come back down underneath you? [inaudible] why? Why was it illegal? Well, it's illegal because it's so dangerous. Um, also she says you're supposed to land all your jumps on one foot, but she did that here. Oh. Like, oh well good. You did. I don't want full toll. Just hold, hold on. Just one. Just hold. And she couldn't be like totally illegal because say as long as land on one foot, maybe we'll be, we will finger about

Speaker 10:         36:38          [inaudible] the program with your back to the judges

Speaker 4:          36:43          and you know, usually is it you skate, you perform, you can smile in front of the camera. But what it gives you as a mark next scary for me took like 10 minutes. Seriously. 10 minutes. People feel about what should we do? I was like, oh my God, they didn't know what to do with me. And I'll say whatever. Just put a zero and so we can move on. Yeah.

Speaker 9:          36:59          Here are the marks that you get mailed. Absolutely. Four, eight, five two she knew. How do you get noted and Olympic competition do a backwards.

Speaker 4:          37:09          So they didn't change their mind about the back flip in the end. Nope. So she ends up finishing 10th I'd like, yeah, I finished in. That's okay.

Speaker 15:         37:17          You go here

Speaker 11:         37:20          now afterwards, a lot of people interpreted that backflip as a big fat middle finger to the entire skating world. I know you don't want me to, uh, but I'm going to do this anyway. But when I asked Ceria if that's what was happening, she,

Speaker 4:          37:37          no, I don't know why people keep saying [inaudible]. You know, I was just trying to be happy. She said she just wanted something that was hers. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Had anyone ever done this back? Flip onto one blade before? No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm the one who created this one. That's why he's calls a Bonelli. Oh, that's [inaudible] anyone who did it. Wow. Yeah. You're the first person in the history of the human race who has done that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So knock on wood, I hope, you know, I'll be able to die in peace. Don't steal my backflip is mind my bad. Yeah, let's, yeah, it's mine. So I'm just curious, like what has happened since this story ended? Well, uh, she retired from figure skating after the 98 Olympics. Um, she continues to do ice shows like occasionally, but right now I think the main thing that she's doing is she's coaching.

Speaker 1:          38:36          She lives in Minnesota and she's coaching skaters. Yeah. But, but like when we asked people like, oh, did she, did she change the sport? Did she change figure skating? The answer they would keep giving to us was no, no, she did a lot of you were like, you know, it's not like all of a sudden, you know, figure skating rinks across the country, across the world are flooded with little black girls learning their sock howls in their letters and things like that. I will say from my, from, from what I can tell for the first time that there are, there's more than one black skater competing at the same time internationally at least, uh, backflips or their back lips. They no, no back, no back. Sadly. Are they still illegal? They are still illegal. Yeah. Yeah. Yes. So, um, she was just this sort of like almost this sort of blip on the skating scene where she was just, you know, no one was like her before and there hasn't really been anyone like her since.

Speaker 1:          39:41          But, but there is this kind of ironic thing I guess, which is that if you took her and, and, and you put her in competition today, if she was competing on the world stage today, she would probably do better than she did back then. They've changed the, the, the, the scoring system. So, so now, um, you get points for doing the kinds of power moves that she was doing way back when and, and even if you, if you spill, even if you fail at those moves, you still get points. You get points for trying. Yeah. Just for, for daring and surreal was uh, was, was daring. She was a Derrer

Speaker 16:         40:28          pretty sure lots of Nasser and Tracy Tracy spent the last few months with us producing that story as part of the deputy NYC fellows program. Tracy, we won't miss a lot.
