00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.160
- [Instructor] In this video,
were going to think about

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.790
the market for apples, but
the more important thing isn't

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.310
the apples, it's to appreciate
that the demand curves

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.480
for a market are really the sum

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.840
of the individual demand
curves for every member

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.020
of that market, and most
markets will have many tens

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.220
or hundreds of thousands of actors in it,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.100
maybe millions or tens of
millions of actors in it,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.950
but for the sake of simplifying things,

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.510
we're going to assume
that the apple market

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.350
has only two buyers,

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.210
and we have their demand
curves right over here.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.180
This is the demand curve for buyer one,

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.950
and this is the demand
curve for buyer two,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.350
and so if the vertical axis is price,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.190
and maybe this is price
per pound of apples,

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.108
and quantity, let's just say
that's pounds per time period,

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:47.000
maybe pounds per week, we can see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440
that from buyer one's demand curve

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.400
that at a price of one, two,
three, four, five dollars

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.640
per pound, they don't
wanna buy any pounds.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.040
At a price of three dollars per pound,

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.400
they're willing to buy one pound per week.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.818
At a price of one dollar per pound,

00:01:02.818 --> 00:01:04.440
they're willing to buy
two pounds per week.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.100
We can similarly look at the
demand curve for buyer two,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.933
and sometimes you'll
see this in table form

00:01:10.933 --> 00:01:13.150
where it's called a demand
schedule, but you can see

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.870
at one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.300
at seven dollars, buyer two
is not interested in apples

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:20.550
at seven dollars a pound.

00:01:21.507 --> 00:01:23.400
At five dollars a pound,
they are interested

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.300
in buying two pounds of apples per week.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.740
At three dollars per pound,
they're interested in buying,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.540
so let's see this is one,
two, three, four, five pounds

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.440
per week, and at one dollar
per pound, they're interested

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.300
in buying six, seven,
eight pounds per week.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.760
So based on this data here,
buyer one and buyer two

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.600
are the only individuals in this market.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.960
Once again, a huge oversimplification.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.300
What would the market
demand curve look like?

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.650
Pause this video and try
to think that through.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.440
Well, if we go to the
various prices, so let's see,

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.873
at a price of seven dollars,

00:02:01.873 --> 00:02:06.450
there is not going to be
any interest in any apples.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.120
So, I could maybe put
that right over there

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.240
at a price of seven dollars,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.850
but what happens is the prices goes down

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.200
and we could just sample
what happens when we get

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.690
to a price of five dollars?

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.210
Buyer one is still not interested,

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.910
but buyer two is now willing
to buy two pounds per week.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.850
And so, at a price of five
dollars, the market as a whole

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.730
is willing to buy two
pounds from buyer two

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.750
and zero pounds from buyer one,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.203
so we'll have a total of two pounds.

00:02:37.061 --> 00:02:38.361
So we're right over there.

00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:40.930
So that is at five dollars per pound.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.010
The market is willing to,

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.950
is demanding a quantity
of two pounds per week.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.490
And then let's go to three dollars.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.270
At three dollars, now, buyer
one would buy one pound

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.910
per week and buyer two would
buy five pounds per week.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.020
So in total, there would
be six pounds demanded

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.600
or the quantity demanded
would be six pounds.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.520
So three dollars, the quantity demanded

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.100
is three, four, five, six.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.490
So that would put us right about there.

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.074
And then last but not
least, and once again,

00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:14.910
I'm just sampling these points
to make the point to you

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.110
that we really would just
add, we would take the sum

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.620
of these curves but we're
kind of stacking them,

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.850
we are stacking them horizontally
as opposed to vertical

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.780
because for any given price,
we're adding up the quantities.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.840
So let's go to one dollar a pound.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.420
At one dollar a pound,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.450
buyer one is willing to buy two pounds,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.320
and at one dollar a pound, buyer two

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.780
is willing to buy eight pounds.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.790
You put those together, two plus eight,

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.400
you get to 10 pounds.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.400
So this was two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.680
and then nine and ten,
we're going a little bit off

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.280
the screen here, I could
have planned better for it,

00:03:51.872 --> 00:03:55.087
but let me go all the way over
here so I'll extend my axis

00:03:55.087 --> 00:03:57.919
so that's nine and then this
is ten so that at one dollar,

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:02.200
the market would be willing
to buy ten pounds per week.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.310
And you could sum at any other
point or any other points

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.550
in between and what you
would do is you would get

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:12.470
a market demand curve that looks

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.720
a little something like this.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.520
And you can see, visually,
what has happened here.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.300
For any price value, we
are summing the quantities

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.900
for all of the buyers in the market.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.166
Now here, there's only two buyers.

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.915
Now if you were doing this
in the real world, you might

00:04:28.915 --> 00:04:30.600
be dealing with millions
of buyers, but this is just

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.290
to understand how a market or
where a market demand curve

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.023
is actually coming from.
