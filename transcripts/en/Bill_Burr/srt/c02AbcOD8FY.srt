1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:01,850
Okay.

2
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:03,440
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr.

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:07,280
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, Monday,

4
00:00:07,281 --> 00:00:11,030
December 4th,
2000 and fucking

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,370
17. Yeah, that'd be great.

6
00:00:15,371 --> 00:00:18,530
I just realized I just gave a fuck and
just gave Dean del Rey a check and I

7
00:00:18,531 --> 00:00:22,880
wrote December 5th on it. I thought
tomorrow was December 5th. Well,

8
00:00:22,881 --> 00:00:27,110
it is by the time you hear this, but
I did this Sunday night. Now fuck it.

9
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:31,100
Tell him not to deposit the check. Well
they can. You can still deposit it right?

10
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:35,180
And then they don't fucking whatever.
I del Ray opened for me this weekend.

11
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:39,710
Holy Shit. We got the levels up
too high here. There are too high.

12
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,120
I can't hear myself thinking here.
For God sakes.

13
00:00:44,121 --> 00:00:49,010
Could you just shut it
down please. Thank you. Um,

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,150
dude, I'm fucking sitting there. What do,

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,900
and I'm sitting there minding my own
business in my house, my fucking house.

16
00:00:56,901 --> 00:01:00,530
Fuck you bankers. It's my now until
I die. And then you get it back.

17
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:05,220
Don't you get cuts? Um,
they just sit there waiting.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,970
If you have a pay off your house,
look out your window.

19
00:01:07,971 --> 00:01:11,750
There'll be a banker sitting out there
like a fucking like a God damn vulture

20
00:01:11,751 --> 00:01:14,240
waiting for you to fucking look at.
Look at him. Look at him eating bacon.

21
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,360
I guess Bacon's good fee.
Now I don't know what the fuck.

22
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,370
I don't know what I know what
I'm talking about. Um, anyways,

23
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,450
um, I wonder what room I'm
going to die in this house.

24
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,790
You ever think about that
when you just get the house?

25
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:31,810
Like I'm not fucking leaving. I'm staying
here. Right? And then you just, when you,

26
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,810
once you make that decision you like,
but then I'm going to fucking die in here.

27
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,540
What room is it going to be? I think a
lot of people die at breakfast nooks.

28
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,480
You know,
just sitting down and having some toast.

29
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:48,680
Read the morning paper.
That wouldn't be a bad way to go.

30
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,290
Let's go face down until like fucking
half piece of grapefruit. Alrighty.

31
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,670
What room would you want to die? And you
don't want to do it in the shower, right?

32
00:01:58,671 --> 00:02:02,270
That's fucking awful. Then you're all
waterlogged, you know, Bang your head on.

33
00:02:02,271 --> 00:02:06,500
The fucking lot of people die in
the shower. They slip and fall,

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,770
you know,
and they can't get up right.

35
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:11,480
And that's why they came
out with that fucking,

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,490
that thing there for all the old people.

37
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,630
But what a lot of people don't realize
is a lot of them fall in the fucking

38
00:02:17,631 --> 00:02:20,060
shower and then they did
go to use their little,

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,640
I've fallen and I can't get up thing.
And then they get electrocuted.

40
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:27,050
I don't think that happens,
but I would be worried about that.

41
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:31,260
Trying to drag my old pruned
as out of the fucking tub.

42
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:37,240
Oh my God. That's gotta be the
worst. When you get so old,

43
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,770
you're afraid to take a shower.

44
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:41,570
You got to bring like a
fucking lazy boy in there.

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:51,410
Oh Shit. I'm sorry. That just
fucking struck we, it's funny,

46
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,940
he just got a giant lazy,

47
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,050
you got a recliner in your
shower so it's waterproof.

48
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,590
I don't know the fuck you.
I liked.

49
00:02:59,591 --> 00:03:03,760
I love that flashlight that just came out
that, that, that runs on water. I mean,

50
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:07,420
give me, what are we doing? What the
fuck are we doing in the Middle East?

51
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,520
Jesus Christ.
Jesus Christ.

52
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,670
Just put that in a fucking car stick
20 olds flashlights in the car.

53
00:03:12,671 --> 00:03:16,800
I'll drive slower. Let's just
get out of there already, right?

54
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:20,050
The fuck we think we're doing.
You don't find the Middle East is like,

55
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:24,160
Molly's is like you're a civilian and
you get in the middle of like a domestic

56
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:28,180
violence fucking incident, you
know, and you try to break it up,

57
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,070
you know, and the second you go to break
it up, the woman starts beating on you.

58
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:36,340
I get off my abusive husband.
That's what it's like over there.

59
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:39,970
Just fucking get those water flashlights.

60
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,801
This is what you do.

61
00:03:41,801 --> 00:03:46,240
You get those water flashlights and
you put them into fucking Scotus that

62
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:49,600
everybody has to ride his scooter.
Whether you're fat or old or whatever.

63
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,480
You got to ride one and cars are illegal.
All right?

64
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:55,180
The amount of people wipe
it out, dying, right.

65
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,670
Frees up the fucking traffic.

66
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:00,250
We're not using as much oil and
then they go bankrupt over there.

67
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,180
How about that there? Did I
solve the Middle East Obama
me to do that every week.

68
00:04:04,181 --> 00:04:08,950
Every week I'm going to have a new
fucking solution for the Middle East. Um,

69
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,860
anyway, I don't want the fuck
I'm talking about. I just,

70
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,880
can you imagine just having a
giant fucking recliner, you know,

71
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,630
and then you have like that little grabby
thing and you just turn on the fucking

72
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:22,870
water. What are those grabby
things? You know, you fucking, you,

73
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:27,820
you pull the handle and, and you've
got an x, like the fucking groceries.

74
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:30,070
They always grab like a
can of soup or some shit.

75
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:31,520
Yeah.

76
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,000
What,

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,300
why are you bringing from Broccoli
whenever they go up there and they fucking

78
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:39,680
Yank it down? I don't if that
doesn't happen anymore. There's no,

79
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:43,430
there's no regular person running a
fucking grocery store anymore. Is there?

80
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:46,200
Okay.

81
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,850
Grocery stores is a fucking weird man.
Dot.

82
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,190
It can kind of like the
food version of a casino.

83
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,460
Like he just feel like there's somebody
up in the ceiling watching you buying

84
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,390
like a two way mirror.

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,533
When you go in there,

86
00:04:58,630 --> 00:04:59,820
there's really nothing
stopped. But yeah, man,

87
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,400
one time I walked to this grocery store
with Patrice and we acted like fucking

88
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:07,540
children. He got me going
like he was so fucking silly.

89
00:05:07,541 --> 00:05:09,280
I remember one time he just goes,
uh,

90
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:13,030
we will go on and he was staying
at my apartment for pilot season.

91
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:17,680
Both of us creeps trying to get on my CTV.
Yeah. How do you think that worked out?

92
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,600
So,
um,

93
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,460
we were in like Ralph's of some shit
and he just kept going. They bill,

94
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:29,950
you want some of these?
And when he would go to point at it,

95
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,870
he would like key to have his hand
way too close to the bag, the bag,

96
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:38,920
any like it was like bread or something.
He goes, Bill, you need some of this.

97
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:39,850
And he would,

98
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:43,510
he would just push his finger into like
fucking three slices of bread through

99
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:44,344
the wrapper.

100
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,910
And he just started doing that around the
grocery store and I was fucking crying,

101
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:50,970
laughing.
He did it.

102
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,690
The cookies he was doing is doing it to
fruit and these giant fucking fingers.

103
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:57,440
Hey Bill,
you want one of these things?

104
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,990
Just like all the way
through the fucking thing.

105
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,270
And I'm immature is fuck. And it was
just making me fucking cry, laugh.

106
00:06:05,271 --> 00:06:08,550
And he's a comedian, so he just kept
doing it and I was trying to do it.

107
00:06:08,551 --> 00:06:12,500
I could even, you know, my fingers were,
I don't know. I was laughing too hard.

108
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:17,090
I couldn't fucking do it as
good as him. Um, anyways, Geez.

109
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:20,750
I hadn't thought about that for
fucking ever. And I want to apologize.

110
00:06:20,751 --> 00:06:24,380
Maybe it wasn't Ralph's. Where the fuck,
where are we? I always hated rouse,

111
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,570
you know, she's a fucking pain in the
ass. The one that was down the street.

112
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,910
I used to live office
sunset and there was a,

113
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,840
Ralphs used to be called rock and roll.
Ralph's, everything was rock and roll.

114
00:06:35,841 --> 00:06:40,430
Denny's rock and roll. Ralph's steps back
like leftover from the hair metal shit.

115
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,510
You know the rock and roll Hyatt right
next to fucking the comedy store.

116
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,780
John Bonham used to ride motorcycles.
There's some shit into the fucking thing.

117
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:51,614
I Dunno what?

118
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:54,663
MMM.

119
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,060
I have no idea. I don't what the fuck
it was. I even know where we were at.

120
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,160
MMM.

121
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,130
Jesus Christ. I have a side of that. And
Fred, what the fuck was I talking about?

122
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,180
It's talking about being an old man,

123
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,130
but there were cleaner
and a God damn shower,

124
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,760
whatever that moments come and gone.
That's what happens on the podcast.

125
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:14,990
I just fucking talk and whatever
happens, it happens. By the way,

126
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,590
I would like to thank everybody
that came out to Albuquerque,

127
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:25,020
New Mexico. I had a great fucking
time at route 66 casino. I've,

128
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,620
that's the second time I played there.

129
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:31,210
I fucking loved that place to crowd
was awesome. And then the next, uh,

130
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,780
the next last night I played in
Tucson, Arizona, another great town,

131
00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:38,500
just fucking great people,
great parts of the country, um,

132
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:43,090
fun fucking crowds. And
um, I gotta tell Ya,

133
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,760
I'm acting like a fucking idiot on stage.
Like at,

134
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:48,550
I think it's my reaction to this fucking,
this,

135
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,210
this weird fog that is starting to roll
in slowly rolling in over the last five

136
00:07:54,281 --> 00:07:58,090
years on standup comedy where all of a
sudden I sit there on stage and sometimes

137
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:00,730
I think after I say something like,
did somebody record that?

138
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,070
Am I going to get into trouble?
I haven't thought,

139
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:06,130
I never thought that the first fucking
20 years of my career in the last five

140
00:08:06,131 --> 00:08:10,840
years, it just keeps creeping into my
head. And in order to beat it down, I, I,

141
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:12,290
yeah,

142
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:15,350
I dunno. I think I've gone a
little harder. Somebody got,

143
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:19,160
there's gotta be some sort of pushback
on this fucking vibe that's out there

144
00:08:19,161 --> 00:08:23,990
that everything is so god damn serious.
Now Jesus fucking Christ.

145
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,060
Couple guys want to be women.

146
00:08:26,061 --> 00:08:29,030
A couple of guys take their dicks
out at work and then all of a sudden

147
00:08:29,031 --> 00:08:32,870
everybody's got to go, whew.
How did he mean that joke?

148
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,220
Is that a joke or is that
legislation for a new law?

149
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,120
Like this whole fucking vibe that's out
there. It's, it's, it's really weird.

150
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,263
Okay.

151
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,710
It fucking young people are
acting like old people, you know?

152
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,800
And I think that's because they're on
social media and all that shit and they're

153
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,680
just watching this stuff.
24 seven. It's like fucking,

154
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,273
I don't know.

155
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:01,310
It's fucking up their brains.
I mean, come on millennials,

156
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,610
you've got to do something. That spot
you're supposed to make me uncomfortable.

157
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,410
Donors and bureau. Jack Crunch.
What are they going, you know?

158
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:13,350
I guess they have that new
documentary, Meth town on fucking, uh,

159
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,850
Hbo. D Del Ray told me to wash it.
I can't fucking watch that shit.

160
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm not going to watch a
bunch of toothless fucking
people. Those goddamn people,

161
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:23,850
I swear to God, they look like
they're from the 18 hundreds.

162
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,200
That's how bad they fuck their
faces up with that meth shit.

163
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:34,370
I'll tell you, once you lose your
fucking teeth, he look like you're 80.

164
00:09:34,371 --> 00:09:35,510
I don't care how old you are.

165
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:40,400
You could take one of those
gorgeous Victoria's secret
models that if they don't

166
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:41,450
have any fucking teeth,

167
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,630
they didn't get a partial or a fucking
implants or whatever the fuck you call

168
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:50,710
them. Dentures is some shit. If
you just walk around toothless,

169
00:09:50,711 --> 00:09:52,000
you immediately look,

170
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,660
you look like homer Simpson's
fucking that guy that falls asleep.

171
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:59,180
His Dad is his dad.
Um,

172
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,690
that grandfather, right? I
Dunno. Yeah. So I had that on.

173
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,990
I was talking to someone on the
phone and dean kept telling me,

174
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,360
what you got to see it, dude, you
got to see. And even dean said, man,

175
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:13,540
I fucking shut this thing off like three
times. He goes, it's fucking brutal.

176
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,680
So I just had the sound down and I was
watching all these toothless fucking

177
00:10:17,681 --> 00:10:22,660
people with these crazy
looks on their faces. And uh,

178
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,980
I was on the phone and at one point
I just saw somebody kicking dog shit,

179
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,420
like piles of dog shit,
different piles all around the house,

180
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:37,720
like hoarding dog shit out of the way in
this person's house with newspaper all

181
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:42,280
over it and stuff. And um,
that's when I turned the channel.

182
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,830
I don't know about you guys,
but I drew the line at the, uh,

183
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,740
I drew the line at the dog.
Shit,

184
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,980
there's a few things that make
me turn the channel. Okay.

185
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,580
Drug addicts would dog
shit in their house and,

186
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,290
and strong female characters
make me turn the channel.

187
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,130
And not because I have anything
against a strong female character.

188
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,810
It's just that they don't develop them.

189
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,830
I think everybody in Hollywood is so
afraid of getting yelled at by these

190
00:11:10,831 --> 00:11:14,220
women's groups that they just throw
in these strong female characters,

191
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,740
but they don't, they don't make
a three dimensional character.

192
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:21,390
They just have a woman yelling at guys
and grabbing them by their fucking lapels

193
00:11:21,391 --> 00:11:23,730
of their suit and throw
them over couches and shit.

194
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:27,570
It's like they took like leftover Steven
Seagal Shit and the guy will give it to

195
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:32,571
the woman he or see she strung all of a
sudden every fucking shy a fuck you with

196
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:36,310
Dick and balls
to like,

197
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,830
who is this fucking Parson sky outweighs
there by like a fucking hundred pounds.

198
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:42,660
What am I,
what am I watching?

199
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,190
I watched that recently.
I might even say the fucking show,

200
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:50,070
but I'm watching this guy,
this guy's like 40 fucking years old.

201
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:54,220
He's talking to a 19 year old redneck
woman who lives next to a fucking lake in

202
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:56,950
the middle of Arkansas and she's having
a battle of wits with them and she's

203
00:11:56,951 --> 00:12:00,310
winning like Jesus fucking Christ.

204
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,530
The Fun.

205
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:07,530
What kind of a fucking 19 year old could
beat a fucking 50 year old guy in a

206
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:12,541
battle of wits once it talking about
fucking did $10 whatever the fucking kids

207
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,040
play in the Ted though.
Sorry. Whatever you guys play.

208
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,560
Yeah.

209
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:21,930
Um, I'm not a Gamer. All right.
I used to be a Bose sound.

210
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:24,660
I'm still not drinking the fuck is it?

211
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:27,810
It's a one of my a hundred and
some days in at this point.

212
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,080
It's one oh five days,

213
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,970
three days in and it's one oh eight we
went oh nine by the time you listened to

214
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:36,810
this thing. But I gotta tell you
I'm fucking, I'm getting weak.

215
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,110
I'm getting a week.
All the holidays are rolling in.

216
00:12:40,111 --> 00:12:42,180
I think I'll be good through December,
but uh,

217
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:47,580
I'm going to the fucking rose bowl again
this year. This is my 10th. Rosebowl.

218
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,550
Alright. It's the 10 anniversary for
me and Joe Barton. Nick the originals,

219
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,500
the original fucking drunk
maniacs at that game.

220
00:12:58,501 --> 00:13:03,300
And what's so fucking awesome now about
the college football playoff is that

221
00:13:03,301 --> 00:13:06,330
every three years now,
the Rosebowl is a playoff game.

222
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:11,100
Last time it was a Florida state
and Oregon, I believe. Uh, Jameson,

223
00:13:11,101 --> 00:13:14,550
Winston and uh, the guy from
fucking a Tennessee, Tyson's,

224
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:19,050
I can't remember his name. Mary
Yoda. Is that the coach? I know.

225
00:13:19,051 --> 00:13:21,780
What the fuck the guy from
Oregon, he's great. Right? Um,

226
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:26,790
and this year it's going to be the
Oklahoma sooners versus the fucking,

227
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,640
uh, who else got in? Let's see.

228
00:13:29,641 --> 00:13:33,280
It's Clemson versus
Alabama and then we got a,

229
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:37,470
the fucking Oklahoma's playing.
Whoa. Nobody in the big 10 got in.

230
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,610
Yeah.

231
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:43,510
TCU got their fucking asses kicked
and whenever I watch Tcu, they win.

232
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,050
Can't believe I fucking miss that.
Who the fuck is Oklahoma player?

233
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:48,820
Yeah.

234
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:53,710
Wasn't Wisconsin. Clemson is
Alabama. I got to hit pause here.

235
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:57,520
This is going to draw a fuck that you guys
can listen. How dumb I am. I know this.

236
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:00,550
USC didn't get in.
It's gotta be a conference.

237
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:04,810
Fucking champion Miami laws to Clemson.
Auburn didn't get in.

238
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:13,110
Who the fuck is it? I've got to hit
pause. I don't know the fuck it is.

239
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:17,280
I'm an asshole. Georgia. I
actually didn't look it up.

240
00:14:17,281 --> 00:14:19,020
I just sat there and I
fucking started thinking like,

241
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:23,010
who the fuck else is in there?
Miami Central Florida,

242
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:29,010
Florida State, South Carolina,
gators, Georgia. That's how I did it.

243
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,650
Started down, I was stuck down in
Miami and it fucking worked my way up.

244
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:35,820
The George, Jim, Georgia bulldogs. And I
know there's a lot of people were upset.

245
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,710
A lot of people were upset that a,
it's such a flawed fucking system. Um,

246
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,300
I know Jay [inaudible] was telling me
that fucking Alabama didn't play anybody.

247
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:48,450
He's like, they didn't fucking play
anybody. And then I'm thinking like, well,

248
00:14:48,451 --> 00:14:50,430
the big 10 was in his fucking,
you know,

249
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:54,800
Wisconsin being undefeated is amazing
until you fucking look at the,

250
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,653
you know,

251
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,700
the western side of the fucking big 10
Nebraska stanks Illinois was pathetic.

252
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,780
Indiana stakes, Minnesota, stags,

253
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,440
Northwestern was decent. They
were seven and two, but I mean,

254
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,960
if they won that last seven games,
but they played nobody.

255
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,250
Um, and I always sit in there
going like, so I'm like,

256
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,810
what the fuck is he talking about?
You know,

257
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,800
it's like you guys lost a fucking
Iowa. I was, was halfway decent.

258
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,520
Penn state was overrated. What the fuck
you talking about? So you know what I did?

259
00:15:30,521 --> 00:15:35,320
I actually listened to Jay law head and
I looked up the fucking Alabama crimson

260
00:15:35,321 --> 00:15:38,020
tide's fucking schedule
and I gotta tell you,

261
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:42,340
I think I could've got them
five fucking winds. J lie ahead.

262
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,690
Sorry j lie had I owe an apology to
this is who they play. Florida state.

263
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,190
Who stinks then they played Colorado
state at, I don't need what they,

264
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,370
those fucking people should be
selling insurance out there.

265
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:57,700
Get rid of that football team.
Mississippi. They stink this year.

266
00:15:57,701 --> 00:16:01,690
Arkansas stunk this year. Lsu. You
know Lee came on late, but they stink.

267
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,380
I love them. Mercer. Is that
a woman's college? I didn't
know who the fuck that is.

268
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:10,450
Fresno state. I went to that game. Fresno
state. You know, I'd say they stink,

269
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,520
but I've watched too many
of those behind the scenes.

270
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:17,360
Things about fragrance
[inaudible] carriers. I'm not
gonna say shit about Fresno.

271
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,071
I'm just saying,
you know,

272
00:16:18,071 --> 00:16:22,180
they could have been a little
better Vanderbilt at too
fucking smart to be good.

273
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,570
Texas a and M, they stunk.
Tennessee fucking stanks.

274
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,100
Mississippi state was decent and they
played Auburn who is a good fucking team.

275
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,080
And they lost. However they did
beat the shit out of people.

276
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,420
They want 24,
740120360 six to three 41 and nine.

277
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:44,890
They did beat the fuck out of people.
56 that nothing against a woman's college.

278
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:49,070
41 to 10 59 and nothing
against Vanderbilt.

279
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,900
Don't they play a bunch
of fucking architects. Uh,

280
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,590
Nate Barr Godsy was starting
at fucking punter 27,

281
00:16:56,591 --> 00:17:00,850
19 against the Texas a and
m 45, seven. Hey by the way,

282
00:17:00,851 --> 00:17:04,510
all those students that fuck that guy
out of that fucking head coaching job at

283
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:07,840
Tennessee were those signs
that they wrote, was that true?

284
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:13,880
And how? Cause they really
fucking, I don't know man.

285
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:18,990
I hope they did some research this
whole fucking trial by Internet.

286
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:23,920
Um, I left to look that up man. Cause that
just, that was like fucking and stuff.

287
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:28,800
Some of the shit that people wrote on
site. He was at Penn state. I don't know,

288
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,670
during the whole time or part of the
time when that Sandusky guy was there.

289
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,240
But it's just like,
you know,

290
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:35,900
yeah,

291
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:39,290
it's, I don't understand this. I love
how the, like one guy does some shit,

292
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,124
then all of a sudden,

293
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,750
like the most horrific fucking
thing you could do a basically,

294
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:48,890
and then all of a sudden everybody
fucking knew and nobody said anything.

295
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,610
Everybody.
Everybody.

296
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:52,190
Yeah.

297
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:54,410
I'm not saying they weren't
a few people like, oh Jesus,

298
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,450
we got fucking protecting the university,

299
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,660
but just anybody who was there
as automatically fucking guilty.

300
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,820
Some of these fucking
kids, man. I, you know,

301
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:06,200
this whole trial by fucking social
media is a little out of control there.

302
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:09,620
But anyways, I'm, I'm going,
going off the rails here. Um,

303
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,330
so I dunno. We'll see. We'll
see. What the fuck happens. Uh,

304
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,990
I know Jay was upset that Ohio state
didn't get in. I, you got to tell you, oh,

305
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,620
have stayed at a tougher schedule
than fucking Alabama. Easily,

306
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:27,850
easily at a tougher fucking schedule.
But what about, what about Auburn?

307
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:30,650
What about Arbor man, they beat
Georgia when they were number one.

308
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:33,900
Then they beat Alabama. They,
they be too fucking number once.

309
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,600
Then they had to go back and beat
fucking Georgia Gandy couldn't do it.

310
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,920
You know what happened with that?

311
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:42,310
That fucking Auburn's coach
opened his big fat fucking mouth.

312
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,020
We kicked a dog crap out of them.
Did we?

313
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:49,600
We don't check the dog crap out of
them. Didn't, but you know what I mean?

314
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:54,550
I hope every fucking person
who's in, um, sports journalism,

315
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,260
I hope they watch that.

316
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,730
They see that fucking clip and then you
see the fucking Georgia bulldogs showing

317
00:19:01,731 --> 00:19:05,780
up the next game with flames coming
out of their fucking nostrils.

318
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,000
You know,

319
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,420
the next time you're going to sit there
and trash bill Belicheck and say he's

320
00:19:11,421 --> 00:19:14,600
quote unquote was so boring
and his press conferences,

321
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:19,100
that's because the man is a genius.
Bill Belicheck is never going to be like,

322
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,380
we kicked the dog crap
out about dirt work.

323
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,460
We captain fucking dog crap on the boom.

324
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:30,110
Why the fuck would you say that?
You know,

325
00:19:30,111 --> 00:19:33,710
it says that the kind of guy who wears a
fucking golf in hand when he's coaching

326
00:19:33,711 --> 00:19:35,710
a football team,
um,

327
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:41,230
what a dumb fuck it think that that is
the stupidest fucking thing you can do

328
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:46,350
better when the fucking cowboys will
fucking kicking the shit out of the

329
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:50,420
Steelers and like Superbowl nine or
10, I don't know, about 40 years ago.

330
00:19:50,421 --> 00:19:54,350
You have a look at those highlights and
fucking Roy g irrele missed that field

331
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:56,960
goal and stupid as cliff
Harris got in his face,

332
00:19:56,961 --> 00:20:01,920
patted him on the fucking helmet and
then Lambert came over and just body slam

333
00:20:01,921 --> 00:20:05,900
cliff Harris back when you could do that
and there wasn't a fucking, you know,

334
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,400
a bunch of fines and you had to go fucking
sing acapella to some fuck a woman's

335
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:13,760
group. Whatever the fucking punishment
is now. Right. You could do that.

336
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,710
That turned the tide of the game.

337
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,400
Keep your fucking mouth shut until you're
holding the championship trophy and

338
00:20:21,641 --> 00:20:25,250
then you don't need to talk shit cause
you want it. You fucking Ugh. What?

339
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,570
I kept the dog crap out of him.
And what happened?

340
00:20:28,571 --> 00:20:32,630
She played him a few weeks later. You get
the old right there, Fred, don't you? Um,

341
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,410
so anyways, so it was a lot of
'em. There was a lot of uh, um,

342
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,810
I was 100% wrong. I thought j Lo
head was just being a fucking homer.

343
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:44,730
He was absolutely fucking right.
Alabama didn't play anybody,

344
00:20:44,731 --> 00:20:48,020
but they scored a lot of fucking
points. Who knows? We'll see.

345
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:53,290
We'll see. Now if Alabama goes in
and wins the whole fucking thing,

346
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,233
then what does that do?

347
00:20:55,690 --> 00:21:00,690
I actually like how vague this is and
how many arguments that it creates.

348
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:05,860
Just a whole fuck, you know? And
at the end of the day, you can't,

349
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:10,150
you can't open this up to some
giant fucking march madness.

350
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,880
The game is just simply
to fucking violent.

351
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,920
I love that it's four teams and I love
that people get left out, you know,

352
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,301
the same way.

353
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,900
I love seeing a little kid crying because
his mother wouldn't get him the toy

354
00:21:22,901 --> 00:21:25,900
that he wanted. That just warms
my heart whenever I see that.

355
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:29,200
He'd seen a little spoiled
brats like, yeah, fuck you.

356
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:34,300
I gave you cheerios this morning. Didn't
you didn't I, you know, meanwhile,

357
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,830
I'm going to spoil the
shit out of my daughter.

358
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,940
I'm all over the map here and what
the fuck I'm talking about. Um,

359
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,990
so that's what I did all day.
Uh,

360
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,570
all day on fry our Friday and Saturday.

361
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,420
I just watch fucking college football
other than when I was traveling,

362
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,160
going out to

363
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,910
the fuck that I fly out to Albuquerque,
New Mexico. And he was funny.

364
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,010
It was a six hour drive
from Albuquerque to Tucson.

365
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,740
I should have done that.
I wasn't paying attention.

366
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,440
I actually flew down and rather
than getting a direct flight,

367
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:10,680
I had to connect through Phoenix.
So it was the fire.

368
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,920
I could have flown from La to
the Goddamn Columbus, Ohio,

369
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,660
you know, and uh, speaking
of buckeyes right in that,

370
00:22:19,661 --> 00:22:21,000
the amount of time that
it took me in this,

371
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:25,060
the fucking person who flew us
from Phoenix, from, from uh,

372
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:29,650
Albuquerque to Phoenix. Okay.
We're taxiing out to get to the,

373
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:33,280
uh, I don't know, on our way
out to the runway. Right.

374
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,840
And the guide bags a left and then
quickly goes back to the right.

375
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:41,080
And I was just like, Whoa, what the
fuck? And I was like, why? You know,

376
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,340
maybe it was the tower.

377
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:47,350
Maybe they said make a left on a bravo
or ah, I mean, right. Sorry. Right.

378
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,970
Correction, go right on. Bravo. Right.

379
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,540
So I got this app where I
can listen to the tower.

380
00:22:52,541 --> 00:22:55,810
So I put it on to here to try and
listen to see if I could hear anything,

381
00:22:55,811 --> 00:23:00,280
which I couldn't.
So we take off flights,

382
00:23:00,281 --> 00:23:01,690
great flying,
everything's fine.

383
00:23:01,691 --> 00:23:04,270
Not No fucking problems would
come in and go land, land.

384
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:08,230
Landing was nice and everything. And
then we're going in. But taxing in,

385
00:23:08,231 --> 00:23:10,690
we go into, get into the [inaudible]
where you parked the plane,

386
00:23:10,691 --> 00:23:14,110
whatever the fuck he called it,
the gate. And this fucking guy,

387
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,580
he literally did a donut.

388
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,600
He did a three 60 with the
airplane he wants again,

389
00:23:19,601 --> 00:23:23,020
went left when he was supposed to go.
Right. And we fucking did an entire three.

390
00:23:23,021 --> 00:23:24,520
Not that,
maybe not an entire three 60.

391
00:23:24,521 --> 00:23:28,960
I think he just missed the gay and he
just drove by it and then he couldn't go

392
00:23:28,961 --> 00:23:31,730
right into it because he would have
hit the other plane. So we had to,

393
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:35,250
because it was on the right hand side,
he had a bang, the left and we lose it.

394
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,830
Did like a fucking doubt it. And
everybody's in the play. Like,

395
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:42,940
what the fuck are we doing?
Guide a bad day. He or she,

396
00:23:42,941 --> 00:23:47,390
whoever the fuck was up
front, um, it was hilarious.

397
00:23:47,391 --> 00:23:49,790
Everybody was getting off the
plane. I do. What the fuck was that?

398
00:23:50,690 --> 00:23:55,080
The hell just happened. You
know what happens? You know,
you drive down the street,

399
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:58,310
sometimes you miss the home depot. Like,
yeah, fuck, I gotta go back around again.

400
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,480
I don't feel like doing it legally. And
you just fucking bang a Uie. Right. Well,

401
00:24:02,481 --> 00:24:06,890
the same thing happens in aviation,
evidently ever fucking deadly.

402
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,550
The same thing happens. Um, Jesus,

403
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:13,130
what the fuck is going on
in Kansas City by the way?

404
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,010
They lost to the New York jets,
jets at decent.

405
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:17,580
Okay,

406
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,440
good Lord. This is why, you know,
coaching in the NFL has got to be a bitch.

407
00:24:22,441 --> 00:24:26,310
Can you imagine Andy Reed
after September starts to year,

408
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,180
they, they fucking beat the dog.
That the fair, we beat the dog crap.

409
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:34,440
All of them fucking Patriot
show like right. Not really.

410
00:24:34,441 --> 00:24:37,740
They just dominated the fourth quarter
and ran away with it at that point. Right?

411
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,340
Everybody's all excited. Holy
Shit. Then all of a sudden,

412
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:44,130
Tom Brady's fucking old and uh,

413
00:24:44,131 --> 00:24:47,530
the fucking water goes down the drain
the different way. Black is white, white.

414
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:47,971
He's black.

415
00:24:47,971 --> 00:24:51,210
You don't know what the fuck's going on
all the way through September. I bet he,

416
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,780
we started at building an addition
onto his fucking house, you know,

417
00:24:54,781 --> 00:24:57,430
getting ready to put that
fucking trophy in there. And uh,

418
00:24:57,450 --> 00:25:00,510
after these last two fucking months,
the last eight goddamn weeks,

419
00:25:00,511 --> 00:25:03,570
I would say that the,
that they've stopped the construction,

420
00:25:03,571 --> 00:25:08,160
he probably has a tarp over the
top of it. Um, I like Andy Reid.

421
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,710
I hope they turn it around.
I haven't been able to watch the game,

422
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:14,090
but Jesus fucking Christ,

423
00:25:14,091 --> 00:25:18,290
they can't get a goddamn when
they cannot get a fucking win.

424
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,350
So, um, I actually watched a bunch of
football today too when I, when I landed,

425
00:25:24,351 --> 00:25:26,180
I watched the Patriots first,
the bills.

426
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,370
I thought that was gonna
be a lot closer game.

427
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:32,360
I thought tie Rod Taylor was going
to give us headaches. All right,

428
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,240
tie Rod Taylor. I liked that
guy, but I'll tell you right now,

429
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,680
he is no Russell Wilson.

430
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:40,970
And after watching the fucking Seattle
Seahawks tonight I'm going to go out on a

431
00:25:40,971 --> 00:25:42,980
limb.
I think I could block for Russell Wilson.

432
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,820
I could just have a guy in about eight
seconds run around me and then just watch

433
00:25:48,891 --> 00:25:52,910
him fucking be like this
modern day Fran target did.

434
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:55,130
That guy is fucking unbelievable.

435
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:59,000
I don't even know how good
Seattle's offensive line is.

436
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,380
I don't even know if they're decent.

437
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:03,740
All I know is at the end of
every game they should be giving.

438
00:26:03,741 --> 00:26:08,741
They should be fucking making it rain at
Russell Wilson's locker because they're

439
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:15,050
all going to get a big contract because
I guarantee you he probably got sacked

440
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:19,130
probably, I dunno what, three times,
four times less than he should have.

441
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,510
The fucking eagles were in the backfield.
Oh,

442
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,380
it was like every time we
went back for the past,

443
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,470
the guy had run like an extra 40
yards until somebody got opened.

444
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,450
The Guy, I'm like, I dunno.

445
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:35,230
Like I felt like they got maybe two
or three times that game maybe. Um,

446
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:41,180
but Jesus Christ is that guy fun to watch
and Seattle looks to Seattle look fun.

447
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:42,550
They look really strong,
man.

448
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,220
I was actually kind of like root for
the Eagles because, uh, you know,

449
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,720
I don't know what the
Patriots going to do. I,

450
00:26:48,721 --> 00:26:51,990
you never know when you're
playing the AFC east, you know,

451
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:55,860
that's our fucking schedule is like
the Alabama Crimson tide. You don't,

452
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,030
Dolphin Stank bill stink that Jed stink
this year. They're all fucking average.

453
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:04,330
You know what I mean? There's literally
six wins right there. Um, so I,

454
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:08,160
I really don't know how good we are,
but, uh, that was a huge game tonight.

455
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,130
This always feels like a sports podcast.

456
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:15,180
I did start off talking about fucking
old people in Lazy Boys, right? Didn't I?

457
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,580
And I, I also believe I solved
the Middle Eastern crisis.

458
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,533
MMM.

459
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:26,100
I just watch, I'm sorry. I just watched
a ton of fucking football and uh,

460
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,830
well at this point you gotta be the
football if you're still listening.

461
00:27:28,831 --> 00:27:33,300
So I'm not gonna apologize.
I should apologize like
fucking 10 minutes ago. But,

462
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:38,310
um, I dunno. The defense
looked fucking great. Richard
Sherman isn't even in there.

463
00:27:38,311 --> 00:27:41,740
Can I ask you guys a fucking question
about the Achilles Tendon? Why do,

464
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,830
why do you rupture your Achilles
tendon but you tear your ACL?

465
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:48,331
Why is that?

466
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:51,870
Why don't you rupture your ACL and
tear your fucking Achilles Tendon?

467
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:55,260
Why is that? Is it because
your Achilles tendon goes up?

468
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,220
You fought back he leg like
a fucking window shade?

469
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,120
Is that what it is? You don't, I'm
actually going to look that up.

470
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:05,760
I'm going to look that up.
I'm going to put this fucking urban myth.

471
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,700
This is it a room with bill? No,
it's not. It's uh, I don't know.

472
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
It's a fucking question I have.
Why?

473
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,430
Yeah.

474
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:17,670
Do you rupture a,
that's not going to come out right?

475
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,300
Your Achilles. Okay. Wait,
now because there'll be like,

476
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,790
cause you fucking didn't stretch.
That's a wrong way to search. How about

477
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,670
rupture?

478
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:34,703
Verse Tear.

479
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:38,300
Achilles. All right, and let's see
what we got here. What do we got here?

480
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:40,260
Yeah.

481
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:45,060
Achilles tendon rupture is an injury that
affects the back of your lower leg. Oh,

482
00:28:45,061 --> 00:28:46,170
is that where it is?

483
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,260
Jesus Christ.

484
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:54,620
All right. It mainly occurs in
people playing recreational sports.

485
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:57,410
That means white guys playing pickup hoop.
Every fucking white dude.

486
00:28:57,411 --> 00:28:59,930
I know over the age of 40, 35, 40,

487
00:28:59,931 --> 00:29:02,600
who still plays hoops that every
one of them gets to Coby injury.

488
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:07,220
But it can happen to anyone.
That's why before you get out of bed,

489
00:29:07,221 --> 00:29:12,020
if you're a fucking old person,
especially an old white guy. All right?

490
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,900
I don't know. I mean the main black
guys other than than, than fucking, uh,

491
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:19,700
Richard Sherman and Koby Bryant like
superstar black guys do it right,

492
00:29:19,701 --> 00:29:21,890
but average white people
just all the fucking time.

493
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,340
I'm just making up shit here before
you get out of bed in the morning.

494
00:29:25,341 --> 00:29:28,850
I'm telling you, if you, if you run a
little tight, okay, I'm telling you,

495
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,310
I've said this before,
you fucking take your toes,

496
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,520
point them at your knees slowly.
All right? And if you get an a,

497
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,930
if you get a fucking Charlie horse in
your fucking calves immediately point your

498
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:41,710
toes in the other direction and a
little release. Okay? But if you don't,

499
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:46,810
just point in your fucking do it right
now. Your desk, what the fuck are you?

500
00:29:46,811 --> 00:29:50,440
Do you not doing shit right? But
will you sit down right? Don't do it.

501
00:29:50,441 --> 00:29:53,150
Wait to fucking lay it down. Don't listen
to me, but I'm still gonna talk to you.

502
00:29:53,151 --> 00:29:57,720
Right? Point your toes at
Unis and your knee caps.

503
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,450
That's saw you do. And you just do that
for a good, I don't know, 1520 seconds.

504
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,643
Right?

505
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:06,330
Then you pointed with the other direction
that the fucking wall or whatever,

506
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:08,410
I'm sitting in front of you.
All right,

507
00:30:08,411 --> 00:30:11,410
your dog that's laying on
the end of your bed, okay?

508
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,180
Then once you do that for 15 seconds,

509
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:18,210
then you roll your fucking feet clockwise
a couple times and counterclockwise.

510
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,230
Then you get out of bed.

511
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,780
Don't just lay there for fucking
eight hours sleeping with you,

512
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:28,980
God damn apnea and then just pop out
of bed and take that first step because

513
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:32,450
you're going to get you get you
gotta be fucked. Plant Fisher, right?

514
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,130
It's all that bullshit, right? Let's,
let's continue with the Achilles tendon.

515
00:30:35,131 --> 00:30:35,821
Is he strong?

516
00:30:35,821 --> 00:30:39,960
Fiber is cord that connects the muscles
in the back of your calf to your heel

517
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:43,910
bone. If you overstretch your
Achilles tendon, it can tear. Fuck,

518
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,560
wait a minute.

519
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:49,940
I thought it was cause you didn't
tear slash rupture completely or just

520
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:53,180
partially hits your
Achilles tendon ruptures.

521
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:58,570
You might hear a pop followed
by an immediate bitch like
scream that appears to

522
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:04,560
come from your mouth area now followed
by an immediate sharp pain in the back of

523
00:31:04,561 --> 00:31:08,550
your ankle and lower leg. That is likely
to affect your ability to walk properly.

524
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:11,850
Surgery is often performed
to repair the rupture.

525
00:31:11,851 --> 00:31:15,240
For many people who ever nonsurgical
treatment works just as well.

526
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,460
This is not answering my fucking question.

527
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,500
Okay.

528
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,370
Why do they say rupture

529
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,470
for a killies? I can't believe
I know how to spell Achilles.

530
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,950
So big a fucking Zeplin fan.
I am. I spelled it wrong.

531
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,000
Achilles tendon eruption shows
you what to do if you take,

532
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,660
you know what?
I don't even give a fuck anymore.

533
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:49,090
Somebody has got to be a Goddamn doctor
or a first responder who could fucking

534
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,260
tell me what it means. Um, all right,

535
00:31:52,261 --> 00:31:55,170
let me read a little a

Kansas City to do to, to Mandy's brds.

561
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,820
Eddie Reed's got sweaty titties.

562
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:39,000
He showed that put that shit
on the side of his house.

563
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:44,550
He's going to get fired and
they'll hire a fucking Laos goes.

564
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:48,810
That's what Kansas City does. They torture
their fans. What the fuck happened?

565
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,080

That'd be great if you just
do everything from your house.

627

648
00:38:53,391 --> 00:38:58,220
I wanted to talk about it that
night. Then I, dude, I um,

649
00:38:59,420 --> 00:38:59,901
oh,
you know what?

650
00:38:59,901 --> 00:39:03,250
I ordered this old modern drummer
because it was right around the time John

651
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:06,890
Bonam died and they had this little
John Bonam retrospective.

652
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,310
I thought they were going to be a
little more shocked that he was gone.

653
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,340
They just kind of said,
you know,

654
00:39:10,341 --> 00:39:13,760
he's one of the great drummers of all
time and he has all his beats and all that

655
00:39:13,761 --> 00:39:16,340
shit. You know, it's really,
it's really cool. And like,

656
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:18,280
what's his face on the cover?
Let me see who's on the,

657
00:39:18,281 --> 00:39:22,040
I don't even know who's on the
cupboards from so long ago. It's 1981.

658
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,000
Um, hang on a second. Hang on a
second as I walk across the room.

659
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,463
Okay.

660
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,300
It's uh,

661
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,180
oh shit. It's Peter Criss, Peter,

662
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,060
Chris and he's sitting,
I swear to God,

663
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,090
he is playing a pearl drum kit with
concert Tom's that you novices out there.

664
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:51,990
That means there's no bottom heads.
If you ever watch Phil Collins,

665
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,430
that's what he yet right and uh,
are still has,

666
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,130
he has a kick and a snare and then
he has one, two, three, four, five,

667
00:40:02,131 --> 00:40:06,180
six,
seven rack toms in two floor toms.

668
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,140
So he has an 11 piece kit
to play one a rock and roll.

669
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,910
All Nat a potter.
Ever read David Doo,

670
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:17,940

data but it is crashing. Um,

673
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:29,500
that's what I like about these old
fuck these fat fucking kid is the shit.

674
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,050
And then they got like back
then they had all of these, uh,

675
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:41,180
they got these fucking drum kits.
Do you guys remember when they'd had the,

676
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,770
on the bass drum they'd have the,

677
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,690
they mount to toms and then they'd have
a third one there. When I opened this up,

678
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:50,150
Ludwig,
they've always had the inside front cover.

679
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,060
They actually sky from reo.
Speedwagon Allen Grad, sir,

680
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,880
he has four fucking times.

681
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:04,910
How the fuck did you even reach those
ones up top? Unbelievable. Anyways,

682
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:05,870
I love looking at this shit.

683
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:09,110
You look at like the bass drum pedals
that they had and this was like the 80s.

684
00:41:09,111 --> 00:41:14,090
This was like 15 years after John
Bonam did good times, bad times.

685
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,660
So I can't imagine.
I know he was like the Ludwig speaking.

686
00:41:17,661 --> 00:41:22,340
Look at Peter Criss kid
fucking British racing green.

687
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:29,120
He looks good, man. He looks good, but
without the makeup back in 1981 anyways,

688
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,580
I don't know. I'm going to
do that old shit. I'm sorry.

689
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:36,230
I don't know what the
fuck I brought that up.

690
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,170
I just want to bore you guys to
tear. All right. Tears sparky.

691
00:41:39,171 --> 00:41:42,260
41 minutes and I can start reading.
God knows the way I fucking read.

692
00:41:43,190 --> 00:41:44,610
Does anybody know how you fucking,

693
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,130
you remember your iCloud password
or your Instagram password?

694
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,280
I just fucking, I just, once I
lose him and then I just, I can't,

695
00:41:53,281 --> 00:41:55,500
it's like I can't get into my own house.
All right.

696
00:41:56,310 --> 00:42:00,630
Girlfriend's friend's
boyfriend demands and apology.

697
00:42:01,890 --> 00:42:06,100
Girlfriend's friend's boyfriend.
All right,

698
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,930
so you have a girlfriend who has a friend
who was a boyfriend and they want an

699
00:42:09,931 --> 00:42:14,160
apology from you. Dear Burbank,
bad boy brain, red bird,

700
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:19,710
red bird, whatever the fuck
that means. A Bill Burbank.

701
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:23,970
That's going to be my fucking alias.
A, I've got an interesting one for you.

702
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:28,320
A little bit of context.
I am 24 and two years out of school.

703
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:30,930
I live with my girlfriend
of almost five years,

704
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:34,890
roughly two years ago on a
sorority trip with my girlfriend,

705
00:42:34,891 --> 00:42:36,990
her friend and her friend's boyfriend.

706
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,440
I gave the girl one of those awkward
side hugs after she went out for a beer

707
00:42:43,411 --> 00:42:46,620
run. No sexual intent
whatsoever just to thank you.

708
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:52,480
Evidently the boyfriend felt otherwise
and flew into a rage shortly thereafter

709
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,290
and salting the girl and my girlfriend.

710
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,400
I didn't learn about this
until well after and since.

711
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:05,120
I have no relationship with the guy was
content to let it be and wait a minute.

712
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:10,990
Did the guys see the side hug?

713
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,083
All right.

714
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,710
Wait,
what the fuck happened?

715
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,700
I gave the girl of one of one of those
awkward side hugs after she went out for

716
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:27,900
a beer run. No sexual intent,
whatever, just to thank you.

717
00:43:27,901 --> 00:43:32,760
Evidently the boyfriend felt otherwise
and flew into a rage shortly after.

718
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:34,860
I guess he waited to leave
and this guys a pussy.

719
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,450
Then what are you worried about? He was
fucking there, which she call him up.

720
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,033
Army fucking

721
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:47,380
touched this opposite side
shoulder of mine. All right.

722
00:43:47,381 --> 00:43:51,900
Flash Florida for two years later.
The two of them have just gotten engaged.

723
00:43:51,901 --> 00:43:55,740
My girlfriend will be a bridesmaid
and learn from the other girl.

724
00:43:55,741 --> 00:44:00,030
I will not be invited to the wedding
unless I apologize to the boyfriend now go

725
00:44:00,031 --> 00:44:03,960
fuck yourself.
Fuck this fucking pussy.

726
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:09,280
Why does he call you up?
You could be,

727
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:13,230
where do you that you pathologize me?
Why is this woman marrying this guy?

728
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:17,820
Two years later, he's still mad
about a side hug. Jesus Christ.

729
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,740
How possessive as this fucking maniac,

730
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,170
I feel bad for the woman
that's married this lunatic.

731
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,430
Alright for inappropriately touching
his girl. Well, dude, by the way,

732
00:44:26,431 --> 00:44:29,220
I'm just hearing your side of the story.
You know?

733
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:33,090
Did you do one of those awkward side hugs
and then g Han came off a shoulder to

734
00:44:33,091 --> 00:44:37,470
accidentally went across her ass if it
was just an awkward side Hug, I say,

735
00:44:37,471 --> 00:44:41,400
fuck this guy out of respect for my
girlfriend, I'm attempted to apologize,

736
00:44:41,401 --> 00:44:45,150
but since an apology is admission of
guilt and I didn't do anything wrong,

737
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:46,730
my pride is holding me back.
You know what?

738
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:49,470
Because you just said that actually
believe in you. I actually believe you.

739
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,940
I'm surprised that he's been too cowardly
to approach me and is having to work

740
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:57,690
through to people to get what
he wants. What we do do. Uh,
you know, and I would do,

741
00:44:57,691 --> 00:45:02,190
I would, I would go fucking find out
what sports is playing in that area.

742
00:45:02,550 --> 00:45:07,380
Tell my girlfriend to have a good time
at the fucking wedding. Love the podcast.

743
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:11,190
Loved to stand up. Thanks.
Um, this is what I would say.

744
00:45:11,191 --> 00:45:12,840
I would just say I did nothing wrong,

745
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:17,841
so I'm not apologizing and tell that
groom to be congratulations on getting

746
00:45:18,541 --> 00:45:18,961
married.

747
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:22,140
And at some point he might want to grow
a Dick if he wants to be the man of the

748
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:24,660
house or get some fucking balls.
Dude.

749
00:45:24,661 --> 00:45:27,230
Fuck that guy five ago.

750
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,210
Go It fucking tractor pull before
I would go to the fucking wedding

751
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,990
of Jesus Christ.
You will be fucking hilarious.

752
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:39,240
Go to the wedding anyways.

753
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:42,690
And then after they fucking exchange
their Goddamn viles go up and give her a

754
00:45:42,691 --> 00:45:47,220
side hug. Yeah, Dude.

755
00:45:47,221 --> 00:45:49,620
Fuck that. Fuck that. I don't feel,

756
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:52,980
I don't see any your your letter that
there's any pressure from your now

757
00:45:52,981 --> 00:45:56,430
girlfriend. Um, you know,

758
00:45:57,870 --> 00:46:01,050
however, if you don't go, she,
you know, she might be able,

759
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
went to fact David out outlets and ads
and they're getting married. Your game.

760
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,790
We have flex my rain. You might have to
go down that road, but I gotta tell you,

761
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,100
yeah,
this might be a twofer.

762
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,510
You've very human dating this
woman for five fucking years.

763
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,570
You're not giving her a ring.
So what the fuck did I say?

764
00:46:15,571 --> 00:46:20,571
You dump your current girlfriend and
tell that guy to go fuck himself at a,

765
00:46:20,881 --> 00:46:25,290
you know,
I dump everybody in this fucking story.

766
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,080
Sorry, I'm a little
grumpy. Don't listen to me.

767
00:46:28,081 --> 00:46:30,690
But I definitely wouldn't apologize for
that gun. I wouldn't go to the wedding.

768
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,590
I mean, Gee, you're a guy who the fuck
wants to go to a wedding. This is great.

769
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:37,710
You've got to know all right,
and just stay with that.

770
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,250
I just can't do it because they
feel it's an admission of guilt.

771
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,200
And during this sensitive time, this
climate, I'm worried that did this.

772
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:50,370
If I, if I say I'm sorry that Dennis
would somehow go into my Instagram,

773
00:46:50,371 --> 00:46:53,970
which is tied to me Facebook and overdue,
make Twitter and I might not get a job.

774
00:46:53,971 --> 00:46:56,940
Just call that fucking room.
Or You could just be a manager to say,

775
00:46:56,970 --> 00:47:01,710
I'm not apologizing that guy.
Fuck him. All right. And then you,

776
00:47:01,950 --> 00:47:05,940
you're fucking girlfriend. Unity
we, me, I would love to go,

777
00:47:05,941 --> 00:47:08,550
but I'm not going under
those circumstances. And
I'll tell you right now,

778
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:11,190
if you didn't do shit in
the fucking bride wanted,

779
00:47:11,191 --> 00:47:13,800
you apologize and you didn't want to,
I would back you.

780
00:47:14,550 --> 00:47:19,260
So I'm not going. If you
want to go, you can go off.

781
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,260
You're not going get over here and blow
me and let's go to the game day. You Go.

782
00:47:22,261 --> 00:47:26,910
That's what you say. All right.
Boyfriend rides. Motorcross dear bill,

783
00:47:28,140 --> 00:47:31,610
I love all your work, your comedy.
Thank you. You're so inspired. Ah,

784
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,400
Jesus Christ here buddy. [inaudible]
okay. Where'd I'd like where?

785
00:47:36,401 --> 00:47:38,470
I'd like your input.
Here we go.

786
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:41,980
I'm seriously dating someone who
loves to ride and race motocross.

787
00:47:42,010 --> 00:47:46,960
That's fucking awesome. I bet. I bet this
isn't the same woman from the last one,

788
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:50,440
you know? I bet this is the guy that's
getting married. The motocross guy.

789
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:51,640
This guy's fucking cool.

790
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:52,720
Yeah,

791
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,460
this guy doesn't like a fucking side hug.

792
00:47:54,461 --> 00:47:57,280
He's just going to fucking punch you in
the face with his motorcycle gloves to,

793
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,950
right. Uh, we've been
together for over a year,

794
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:04,180
so I'm starting to think about marriage
and a family with this person because

795
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,710
they're both 25. Well, that's, that makes
sense. Uh, he's awesome in every way.

796
00:48:08,711 --> 00:48:11,890
And the person I know I want to be
with forever. Well, there you go.

797
00:48:11,891 --> 00:48:16,330
But he loves to ride and race motocross.
It's not on the professional level.

798
00:48:16,331 --> 00:48:19,360
It's a hobby.
A sweetheart.

799
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:22,910
You're going to do this to you
going to take away his fucking Abi.

800
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,960
We had a talk recently where I asked
him how long he wants to keep riding.

801
00:48:26,961 --> 00:48:28,280
And he said forever.

802
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:34,290
I know someone who has two children who
husband had an accident riding a dirt

803
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:37,560
bike. He's paralyzed and doesn't
remember who his kids are.

804
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:40,150
Uh,

805
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:43,000
well, Jesus Christ is people who are
getting cars. I mean, come on, man.

806
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:45,820
What are you, what are you doing? This is,
come on, I'll tell you right now, if you,

807
00:48:45,821 --> 00:48:47,410
if this guy who you want to marry,

808
00:48:47,411 --> 00:48:51,070
if you want to make them fucking miserable
after explain this to my boyfriend,

809
00:48:51,071 --> 00:48:54,220
he said his, something's going
to happen to me. It will,

810
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:56,200
whether I'm riding motocross or not,

811
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:00,160
I'm not going to change what I love doing
because of fear of what could happen.

812
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,420
Uh, I gotta tell you this. I am, I
understand why you love this guy.

813
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,060
I'm starting to develop feelings for
this guy. He's holding his ground.

814
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:10,930
He's riding motorcycles. I mean, you
take the fucking Marlboro man here.

815
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,083
Um,
I think,

816
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:18,300
I think that's a selfish response when
it involves your children eight to try

817
00:49:19,091 --> 00:49:21,190
and, well, you get, you
don't have any kids yet.

818
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:22,693
All right.

819
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,770
You said, I hate to try to
convince them to stop something.

820
00:49:27,771 --> 00:49:28,880
He loves doing so much,

821
00:49:28,881 --> 00:49:33,110
but I can't imagine being with someone
who participates in an extreme sport as a

822
00:49:33,111 --> 00:49:35,300
hobby when I have children with them.

823
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:39,680
Is it wrong of me to ask them to promise
to stop and we have kids or am I being

824
00:49:39,681 --> 00:49:40,514
controlling?

825
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,713
Uh,

826
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:45,950
well first of all, the fact that
you asked that you're a cool person.

827
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:47,743
All right?

828
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:51,000
If you're actually questioning
your behavior, this is a thing.

829
00:49:51,001 --> 00:49:54,750
I think you're a little further ahead
emotionally in this relationship than when

830
00:49:54,751 --> 00:49:56,100
he's at where most women are.

831
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,930
All right?
Um,

832
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:04,720
and this is the thing, when you
become a dad, you do change.

833
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:09,580
All right? So that rather than
fucking Nag him about this shit,

834
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:14,830
just let the guy ride and
if you get married, okay,

835
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:18,130
I'm telling you right now, when you
get married and you have a fucking kid,

836
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:22,510
this guy is going to be so fucking
sleep deprived and so God damn tired,

837
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,040
he's not going to have time to ride.
Okay. Though, much as he used to,

838
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:31,420
which will then make it safer cause
he's not writing as much. But um,

839
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:35,750
I think there's a big thing you can't,
when you love somebody,

840
00:50:35,751 --> 00:50:40,100
you have to let them do what they
love. Unless it's heroin. Okay?

841
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:48,120
Or being a pedophile, obvious fucking
things. All right. But other, you know,

842
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,500
if my wife liked all of a sudden wanted
to be one of those roller Derby Queens,

843
00:50:54,501 --> 00:50:57,110
as much as it would fucking destroy me.

844
00:50:57,350 --> 00:51:01,160
Watching her taking those bumps is their
elbow and them is there skating around

845
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:05,450
if she really loved doing it, you know, I,

846
00:51:05,451 --> 00:51:07,230
I wouldn't tell her not to fucking do it.

847
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:10,230
I really would be worried
about concussions. It's
shit like that. I would be,

848
00:51:10,231 --> 00:51:14,920
I'm not gonna lie to you, but um, you
got to let people do what they do.

849
00:51:15,910 --> 00:51:18,400
Uh, it sounds like you've got a really
cool guy that you're dating by the way,

850
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:20,320
so congratulations.
Um,

851
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:25,510
and I think you're going to be a great
mom cause you're doing what a mom does.

852
00:51:25,570 --> 00:51:27,670
A mom's already looking
way into the future,

853
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:30,910
trying to figure out where the danger
is and try to eliminate it. All right.

854
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:34,450
So thank you both. Lucky to have
each other just fucking relax.

855
00:51:34,451 --> 00:51:38,470
Get yourself a god damn glass of wine.
Let the guy ride his bike. You know,

856
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,890
you guys get married someday.

857
00:51:39,910 --> 00:51:42,430
I'm telling you when you get fucking
knocked up and all of a sudden he's got to

858
00:51:42,431 --> 00:51:44,170
go to seven 11,
you know,

859
00:51:44,380 --> 00:51:47,950
cause you want beef jerky
in a fucking fucking,

860
00:51:47,951 --> 00:51:51,550
I don't know if it's some God damn ice
cream whenever you're craving is, uh,

861
00:51:51,551 --> 00:51:56,290
you know, believe me, like I have
had to make adjustments in my life.

862
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,320
Um, I think you'll be fine, but uh,
you definitely really, you know,

863
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:02,711
you know,

864
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,500
they would say a good man's hard to
find a good woman is also hard to find.

865
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,080
And the fact that you're cool
enough to actually be considering,

866
00:52:08,081 --> 00:52:11,290
am I being a Douche share? Uh, I think
you guys are going to be all right.

867
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,470
All right. There you go. Alright.
Neighbor, neighbor invasion.

868
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:20,800
Dear Billy Mango tits, I don't know what
that means. It's bizarre and I like it.

869
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:25,450
All right. I am an older lady, uh,

870
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:30,100
who just moved into a sweet cottage
in the boondocks last month.

871
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,953
All right.

872
00:52:32,650 --> 00:52:37,650
I met my next door neighbor before I
moved in and I liked her instantly as she

873
00:52:38,081 --> 00:52:41,860
seemed warm and funny as it turned out,

874
00:52:41,861 --> 00:52:46,861
she's a Kramer in the first week she came
knocking on my door numerous times for

875
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:50,220
social calls.
Oh No.

876
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,920
And she will stay for
long periods of time.

877
00:52:52,921 --> 00:52:56,610
Even if I tell her I'm busy
and she won't sit down.

878
00:52:56,611 --> 00:52:59,820
So I feel like a captive
audience to her monologues.

879
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,720
I'm a solitary person
and I don't like people,

880
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:06,240
people coming over unannounced
unless it's an emergency.

881
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:11,950
This eight saint little house,
a little house on the prairie.

882
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:16,990
I have told her firmly on numerous
occasions to fucking stop it. Oh,

883
00:53:16,991 --> 00:53:19,330
good for you. You're a
strong person. I like it.

884
00:53:19,690 --> 00:53:23,620
And that would appreciate her emailing
me and waiting for a response or leaving

885
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:28,260
a note if she wants to hang.
I'm not sure how much more clear I can be,

886
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,440
uh, that I am uncomfortable
with the situation,

887
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:35,880
especially when I see her face in my
kitchen window at night, waving me down.

888
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:38,970
It scares the shit out of me.
Yeah, that made me uncomfortable.

889
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,900
She's even knocked on my bathroom
window when I didn't answer the door.

890
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:47,640
I don't wish to be mean. Oh No, you
gotta be mean. You have to be mean. Uh,

891
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:50,760
since I live next to her, I know
she's lonely and well, yeah,

892
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,050
cause she's a fucking lunatic.
What kind of can you,

893
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,680
that's look what she's doing to you
and you don't even live with their,

894
00:53:55,681 --> 00:53:56,910
can you imagine living with this woman?

895
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:02,730
She'd be like that thing in alien that's
on for those fucking people's faces. Um,

896
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,990
I know she is lonely and it,
and I like to be friends with her,

897
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,560
but she,
but she just no comprendo

898
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:11,660
okay.

899
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:16,660
Love your podcast and advice and thanks
you ginger Moose knuckle for not being a

900
00:54:16,761 --> 00:54:21,650
sex offender because all my heroes
are going down. Uh, well, you know,

901
00:54:21,651 --> 00:54:24,800
it's still early in this game. You know,
someone could accuse me of something.

902
00:54:24,801 --> 00:54:27,080
God knows. It doesn't matter. What
the fuck. I mean, I don't know.

903
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:31,150
Nobody really innocent. Nobody who's
seemed innocent has fucking, uh,

904
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:36,150
seem to have been called out
yet. You know, as a couple
of people have been like,

905
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:38,550
I've never met that one of my life
and then it fucking goes away.

906
00:54:38,551 --> 00:54:42,450
So I think it's all right. Right. It
still makes you nervous as a guy going,

907
00:54:42,451 --> 00:54:44,280
Jesus Christ,
you know,

908
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:48,450
this whole trial by social media is
kind of scary over there. All right,

909
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,620
let's stay with the uh,
the, the topic here. Um,

910
00:54:56,450 --> 00:54:58,070
I, I don't, I don't know
when I would just be

911
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:03,010
like all like I can't tell you what to do.
All I can tell you is what I would do.

912
00:55:03,190 --> 00:55:05,410
All right.
I would do what you already did

913
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,460
and um,

914
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:10,200
yeah.

915
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:12,330
All right. You want to know what I
would do when she knocks on the door?

916
00:55:12,331 --> 00:55:15,380
I'd be like, get Outta here. Fuck off.

917
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,670
I would do that when she knocked on my
window and scared the shit out of me.

918
00:55:20,671 --> 00:55:22,770
I'd be like, duty. You
want to your fucking mind.

919
00:55:23,130 --> 00:55:24,330
You're scaring the shit out of me.

920
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:30,970
I want to be friends with you,
but you suffocate me. You asshole.

921
00:55:31,770 --> 00:55:34,720
All right. Do you want to be friends
with me? Yes or no? Yes. Great.

922
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,520
That stop being a fucking jerk off.

923
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:40,600
Stop knocking on my fucking door and my
window. Stop crying. All right. All right.

924
00:55:40,601 --> 00:55:44,080
Come on in. Come in. I'm sorry.
Let me make it some lemonade.

925
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:46,750
She's one of those people.
Um,

926
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,850
I dunno. I W W uh, I
don't, I don't know why.

927
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:55,880
I don't know what I would I get a BB gun?
Maybe shoot her in the fucking knee.

928
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:59,360
She comes over. Maybe she'll
think it's a beehive or some shit.

929
00:55:59,361 --> 00:56:00,320
I don't know what I would do.

930
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:05,340
I Dunno what the fuck I would do if
you've actually told her that she sounds

931
00:56:05,341 --> 00:56:09,240
like a crazy person. Why would you
want to be friends with a crazy person?

932
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,390
I think he just got it.
You just got to ignore.

933
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:13,750
Yeah.

934
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:17,200
Like the next time she knocks on her.
When you window like that,

935
00:56:17,201 --> 00:56:19,870
I would just knock back on the same
on the other side of the window.

936
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:24,100
I'd knocked back and then give her
the finger. See how she handles that.

937
00:56:25,080 --> 00:56:25,550
Yeah.

938
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:26,540
That's one way to do it.

939
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,990
The other way to do it is to start
talking about shit that freaks her out.

940
00:56:29,991 --> 00:56:31,280
If she's really religious.

941
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:35,810
Just talk about how much you love Satan
and you've given yourself over to him.

942
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:46,610
Uh, I dunno what else you could do fart
in her presence. I Dunno. I have no idea.

943
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,620
I don't know what to do.
I feel bad for you. Um,

944
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,870
for some reason it reminded me of misery.

945
00:56:52,871 --> 00:56:56,890
I just keep picturing that
woman walking up to the window,

946
00:56:56,891 --> 00:56:59,260
the CACA duty,
whatever fucking come up to the window.

947
00:56:59,410 --> 00:57:04,330
It's very American horror
story. Uh, wife cries at least.

948
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:07,600
So I hope that helps you out.
Um, I would just be more firm,

949
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:14,420
right? Or a letter. Dear
neighbor. Fuck off. Sincerely, uh,

950
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:19,250
solitary woman in college, uh,
cottage next to you, right? All right.

951
00:57:19,251 --> 00:57:21,980
Wife cries at least three times a week.

952
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:29,120
Dear Bill Burr Baggins a big fan of you,
of your f you attitude towards life.

953
00:57:29,121 --> 00:57:31,430
I don't have a fuck you
attitude towards life. Okay.

954
00:57:31,431 --> 00:57:36,431
I think it's very precious and know that
I am taking notes by telling people to

955
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:40,010
go fuck yourself. All
right. Anyways, anyways,

956
00:57:40,011 --> 00:57:43,880
I have an issue with my wife to
be because she cries all the time.

957
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,640
All right.
That's a deal breaker for me.

958
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,540
Yeah.

959
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:52,300
I'm sorry. I already had my
advice. Next time she cries,

960
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:58,030
just gently put your hands on on her
shoulders and be like, honey, honey,

961
00:57:58,090 --> 00:57:58,923
honey,

962
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:02,690
grow up.
Um,

963
00:58:03,170 --> 00:58:07,490
no, you can't do it. All right.
We've known each other since January,

964
00:58:07,490 --> 00:58:11,930
2017 and our marriage was
arranged, not forced, but arranged.

965
00:58:13,070 --> 00:58:15,890
All right. This is like tear and
rupture. What the fuck does that mean?

966
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:20,150
We both chose to marry each other after
our parents allowed us to talk on the

967
00:58:20,151 --> 00:58:24,450
phone for a few months.
Oh,

968
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:29,550
what the fuck is this? What? What in what
in guy will cause she did. If they, if,

969
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:34,030
if they didn't allow you to talk on the
fucking phone the first time you poke

970
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:35,470
your head out of the
ground. Yeah. You're gonna,

971
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:38,020
you're gonna marry whatever you do
just to get away from those controlling

972
00:58:38,021 --> 00:58:40,000
maniacs.
Anyways,

973
00:58:40,001 --> 00:58:44,380
since we'd been together and she's cried
more times than I've cried in my life,

974
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:47,410
including the Times I've cried
during my childhood, everything,

975
00:58:47,411 --> 00:58:49,360
she's crying because she
doesn't want to marry you.

976
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:50,560
That's what I'd be worried about.

977
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:55,120
She cries for various different reasons
and like her little sister annoys her,

978
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:58,870
feels like she's lucky to have me.

979
00:58:59,380 --> 00:59:04,180
Feels like her parents don't value her
or she feels like she won't do me proud

980
00:59:04,181 --> 00:59:07,690
as a wife. Oh my God. Oh my God.

981
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,920
Oh my God.
Oh my God.

982
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,230
I don't even know what
to do with this person.

983
00:59:15,430 --> 00:59:17,830
But you know that you seem like you're
from a different part of the world,

984
00:59:17,890 --> 00:59:19,690
the different cultures. So, but you,

985
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,120
you do

986
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,530
seem to know it,
but oh my God,

987
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:30,070
Jesus fucking Christ.
I,

988
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:33,110
I think I would start crying. I just,
if you don't stop fucking crying,

989
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,940
I swear to God I'm gonna kill myself.

990
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:39,020
And that would make her cry even more
and just be like, what do I have to do?

991
00:59:41,390 --> 00:59:42,223
Okay.
Anyways,

992
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,840
we are definitely getting married
is that line has been crossed.

993
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,620
So cutting it off isn't a possibility
to where the fuck are you in the world.

994
00:59:54,490 --> 00:59:58,200
I love her more than you love
the freckles on your face, but,

995
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,430
but this is crying is wearing me down.

996
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:04,810
Yeah.

997
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:04,811
Well,

998
01:00:04,811 --> 01:00:08,830
it seems like you still have a sense of
humor about it as I have to comfort her

999
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,831
every time and just stare at her
on facetime and she cries at times.

1000
01:00:15,641 --> 01:00:20,560
It just gets super annoying because
she does cry over small shit.

1001
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:23,650
I gotta tell you something.
I don't know this woman and she's already,

1002
01:00:23,651 --> 01:00:26,290
she's annoying the shit out of me.
Anyway,

1003
01:00:26,291 --> 01:00:30,940
she has a busy schedule because
she's training to be a teacher.

1004
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:34,750
Oh God. I hope she doesn't fucking
teach them under privileged kids.

1005
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:37,450
She'll have a goddamn nervous breakdown.
Second,

1006
01:00:37,451 --> 01:00:40,990
she starts crying and shows weakness.
It's going to be over anyways,

1007
01:00:40,991 --> 01:00:42,610
getting a Postgrad,

1008
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:48,100
organizing Islamic events,
parentheses,

1009
01:00:48,370 --> 01:00:53,050
no isis jokes please.
And she does and Islamic course at night.

1010
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:56,500
So I understand that she
has shitloads on her plate.

1011
01:00:58,260 --> 01:01:02,610
She's under confident and she feels like
she's not the model woman you see on

1012
01:01:02,611 --> 01:01:07,460
Instagram. Although I assure her
that she is beautiful and I love,

1013
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,780
or just the way she is,

1014
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:15,120
I really don't know how to deal with
this or even approached the situation.

1015
01:01:15,121 --> 01:01:19,470
Sometimes I find that I am avoiding
her because I know Allie will lead to

1016
01:01:19,471 --> 01:01:23,010
crying. And what you have
you, what do you suggest

1017
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:27,090
your podcast is?
Sex to my ears.

1018
01:01:27,091 --> 01:01:31,740
Nia is awesome and I hope Lola is not
giving me a too many sleepless nights.

1019
01:01:31,741 --> 01:01:35,340
Thank you for listening.
Old Bright Ball bag. Billy.

1020
01:01:36,970 --> 01:01:38,640
Um,
Jesus fucking Christ.

1021
01:01:40,020 --> 01:01:40,853
MMM.

1022
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:44,780
Jesus fucking Christ.

1023
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:48,650
I don't know what to tell you dude.

1024
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:50,420
Okay.

1025
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,880
I really, I really don't know
what the fuck to tell you.

1026
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:54,520
Yeah.

1027
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:57,690
Aye. Aye. I, I don't know how
to solve this. This is like,

1028
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:05,440
how do you tell a woman to stop crying
in a way that doesn't make them cry more?

1029
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:09,450
All right.
Okay.

1030
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:14,250
You know what I do when my wife is going
to cry and I don't think it's that big

1031
01:02:14,251 --> 01:02:16,670
a deal at or I just don't
want to deal with it

1032
01:02:18,730 --> 01:02:20,250
when starts to cry.

1033
01:02:22,100 --> 01:02:22,440
Okay.

1034
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:27,440
I just look at her and I jut out my
bottom lip and I make the saddest,

1035
01:02:28,471 --> 01:02:33,020
most pathetic. Just picture like
a sad clown. I make the saddest,

1036
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:37,440
stupid face, stupidest face. And I looked
down while still looking up at her.

1037
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,180
Just imagine that look,

1038
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:43,320
and it always makes her laugh and she
gets fucking mad at me because she can't

1039
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:46,470
continue crying because I
looked so fucking ridiculous.

1040
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:51,510
And another way you could do it is bright.
Before you make that face,

1041
01:02:51,670 --> 01:02:56,160
you take a big inhale, you go, Oh man, you
just make that face. And I'm telling you,

1042
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:58,410
if you,
if she has this sense of fucking humor,

1043
01:03:00,370 --> 01:03:04,470
that's what I would do. I the,
I think that's what I would do.

1044
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:07,680
I would just joke my way out of it.

1045
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:09,000
Yeah.

1046
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:13,380
Anytime she was crying over nothing,
I would start crying with her.

1047
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:19,990
Like, I just don't feel that I'm going
to be a good enough husband for you.

1048
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:21,430
And be like, oh. And I would just be like

1049
01:03:22,020 --> 01:03:23,810
worried about that too.

1050
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:32,470
Now you have to know this. I am a dick.
All right. But that's what I would do.

1051
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,870
I would just start doing that.

1052
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:39,760
And what's going to happen is hopefully
she'll toughen up a little bit. Um,

1053
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:43,230
Jesus Christ.
Do you know,

1054
01:03:43,240 --> 01:03:48,240
fucking nervous that would make me if
a woman was crying because she loves me

1055
01:03:48,731 --> 01:03:51,650
that much and was worried that
she wouldn't be a good fucking I,

1056
01:03:51,651 --> 01:03:54,680
I would break up with her. I'd be like,
I can't handle that pressure. Yeah.

1057
01:03:57,630 --> 01:03:59,300
Jesus Christ born. What is going
to happen when she finds out?

1058
01:03:59,301 --> 01:04:03,770
I can't fucking read out loud.
Uh, mom's comment on pizza.

1059
01:04:03,860 --> 01:04:07,940
Good luck to you, sir. That's what I would
do. I would use humor. I would use humor.

1060
01:04:11,640 --> 01:04:12,320
Yeah.

1061
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,170
You know, next time she goes, honey,
can I talk to you about something?

1062
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:20,230
I would have like 40 fucking boxes of
Kleenex and just fucking run over with

1063
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:24,380
like five boxes of Kleenex.

1064
01:04:24,381 --> 01:04:27,110
Just I would just do something
to make it silly and ridiculous

1065
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:33,320
and then she might get upset that you
do that. I guess I would then say, uh,

1066
01:04:35,390 --> 01:04:39,810
the fuck would I say. I would
just be honest. Just say, listen,

1067
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,720
I, I, I love you to death,

1068
01:04:42,721 --> 01:04:46,830
but why you delete the
amount that you cry?

1069
01:04:46,831 --> 01:04:51,620
I don't know how to deal with it. Oh
fuck that made you cry. Jesus Christ.

1070
01:04:52,850 --> 01:04:56,630
What do you guys see? What do, what do
you Islamic guys say when you curse,

1071
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:00,600
what do you, what do you say instead
of Jesus Christ? What do you, what do,

1072
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:04,960
what do you say? Uh, do
you say something you take,

1073
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:06,760
do you take Mohamed's name in vain?

1074
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,480
Do you do something like that and with
the whatever the fuck it is you say, I,

1075
01:05:09,490 --> 01:05:14,020
I would, I would be really
a, that would really fun.

1076
01:05:14,050 --> 01:05:18,940
I mean, that's a lot. These fucking
letters are a lot this week.

1077
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:23,770
Okay. The fucking neighbor,
the Goddamn fucking Douche bag.

1078
01:05:23,771 --> 01:05:27,340
Who needs an apology for a fucking
side hug through two different women?

1079
01:05:27,341 --> 01:05:31,950
He needs to get his apology.
That guy, he's such a pussy.

1080
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,640
What kind of fucking guy uninvited
another guy who a fucking wedding is.

1081
01:05:35,641 --> 01:05:38,880
If that's some sort of punishment,
he just made his day. You asshole.

1082
01:05:39,210 --> 01:05:43,650
If you really didn't like the side hug,
you should make them fucking go there. Um,

1083
01:05:45,210 --> 01:05:47,360
and that is the one cool check
who fucking boyfriend rights.

1084
01:05:47,770 --> 01:05:50,820
Motorcross all right.
Not saying the other people were cool,

1085
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:54,000
but could lord life cries
at least three times a week.

1086
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,110
I read that it's three times a day,
three times a week. That's still a lot.

1087
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,990
It's 156 times a year.

1088
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:11,980
That's what I would do. All right.
Three 65 minus one 56. Oh Jesus.

1089
01:06:12,730 --> 01:06:17,170
Two 56 to 50.
That's 100 9,494 days.

1090
01:06:17,171 --> 01:06:21,130
You're not crying
156 you are.

1091
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:23,663
Okay.

1092
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,350
That's like Marty Schottenheimer's
lifetime record that like that's the way

1093
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:31,230
you're crying.
Days you cry versus days you don't,

1094
01:06:32,160 --> 01:06:33,930
and that's not enough to
make it in this league. Okay?

1095
01:06:33,931 --> 01:06:37,350
So I'm going to need you to toughen
it up at least two thirds more.

1096
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,580
Why don't you tell us she,

1097
01:06:39,581 --> 01:06:43,680
she's allowed to cry once a week
unless something really bad happens.

1098
01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:45,613
Okay.

1099
01:06:47,730 --> 01:06:48,660
Um, you know, you could do,

1100
01:06:48,661 --> 01:06:51,300
you could go to the pet store and get
one little shocker college and every time

1101
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:56,250
she starts to cry just fucking sapper. Um,
I dunno. I don't know what to tell you.

1102
01:06:56,290 --> 01:07:00,900
All right.
Mom's comment on pizza leads to break up.

1103
01:07:03,070 --> 01:07:07,420
I have no idea where this is going. All
right. Hey, bill weekly listener here.

1104
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:11,470
Love F is for family and all your
standup stuff. Keep up the good work.

1105
01:07:11,500 --> 01:07:15,770
My question is what experiences
Ada.

1106
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:22,740
Ah, good to see you
come on in. Come on. And

1107
01:07:24,450 --> 01:07:29,340
a knee at this guy's fucking
wife. Christ. Three times a week.

1108
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:34,920
Why? That's hilarious. Did you
guys hear that? She goes, whoa.

1109
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:39,420
Are you going to cry?
She cries because she loves him so much.

1110
01:07:41,650 --> 01:07:43,300
She just did a spit take.

1111
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:50,080
I swear to God.
She does.

1112
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,580
Yes she does. So what do you love
somebody that much? They cry at the,

1113
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:55,870
that was the way. This is
the thing that they, they're,

1114
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:59,080
they're Islamic and their
parents allowed them

1115
01:08:01,240 --> 01:08:04,420
[inaudible] like well listen,
knock it off. Exactly.

1116
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:09,550
I was telling him what I do when you cry
baby at that time when you would cry.

1117
01:08:09,551 --> 01:08:11,150
And I just kept making that face.
I go,

1118
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,770
which was not helpful by the way.

1119
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:19,040
It helped me cause I just didn't want
to deal [inaudible] you, I know me.

1120
01:08:19,041 --> 01:08:22,070
If I'm crying, I'm having an emotion
about something and I Tell You something,

1121
01:08:22,110 --> 01:08:25,910
the jab is into like checkout and figure
out how to wait for you to deal with it.

1122
01:08:25,911 --> 01:08:30,500
Your job is to like check in and
figure out how I can deal with it.

1123
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:35,570
Your job is to make me feel better,
not cope for yourself. God. Yeah,

1124
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:39,640
but sometimes you just don't want
to deal with like, you know when I,

1125
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:44,330
you know when I occasionally deal
just fucking deal being nice person,

1126
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,920
be emotionally open,

1127
01:08:46,070 --> 01:08:50,900
don't be a fucking vast
wasteland of non emotion.

1128
01:08:50,901 --> 01:08:54,150
Man. Are you? Hi.

1129
01:08:56,460 --> 01:09:00,810
Yes you are the right not to answer that.
Um,

1130
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,040
nobody cries. She's lying cause she's
not crying that much cause she loves him.

1131
01:09:05,610 --> 01:09:08,460
Can I tell you something? Do
you know like, do you know?

1132
01:09:08,470 --> 01:09:10,440
Occasionally I'll get
upset and I go on a rant.

1133
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:14,610
Would it be great if you knew how to say
what your version of that is when you

1134
01:09:14,611 --> 01:09:18,470
cry? No, it is. No, it is no,

1135
01:09:18,690 --> 01:09:23,580
don't tell me how I feel.
Don't tell me how I react to things.

1136
01:09:23,581 --> 01:09:26,850
I don't cry. Like, don't respond
to my, don't tell me with your,

1137
01:09:26,851 --> 01:09:30,900
don't tell me I'm angry. I'm angry. If
I'm emotional, I'm fucking emotional. Hey,

1138
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:33,540
can I finish this?
These people are Islamic.

1139
01:09:33,840 --> 01:09:37,970
This is an arranged marriage.
It's, it's not forced.

1140
01:09:38,170 --> 01:09:41,940
Just listen for fuck sakes. Can we
get over it in the mic? All right.

1141
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:46,950
They actually were allowed to talk on
the fucking phone for a few months. Okay.

1142
01:09:46,980 --> 01:09:50,990
Okay. So yeah, these are,
these are fucking pissed
off. This is very respected,

1143
01:09:51,030 --> 01:09:54,780
secluded life here. I
got it. So, you know,

1144
01:09:54,781 --> 01:09:58,200
she's bur emotions are at the surface,

1145
01:09:58,201 --> 01:10:01,230
so she cries if for
little sister annoys her,

1146
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:04,020
if she feels she feels
she's lucky to have me.

1147
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:09,560
Feels like her parents don't value her
or she feels like she won't do me proud

1148
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:14,940
as a wife. Oh. So whenever
she's having emotions basically,

1149
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:18,510
right. What's a good way to be
like, honey, I love you to death,

1150
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:21,690
but could you fucking knock it off
because you're driving me crazy?

1151
01:10:21,960 --> 01:10:25,920
How do you say that to a woman
without making her cry more?

1152
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:32,970
Uh, I mean, yeah, she seems like
she would cry if you told him.

1153
01:10:33,030 --> 01:10:36,720
If you told her like, you know,
the t was not sweet enough,

1154
01:10:36,721 --> 01:10:38,820
so she's definitely a sensitive,

1155
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:43,840
I told him to start crying too.
Like she's just like,

1156
01:10:43,841 --> 01:10:45,700
I'm just worried. And I was like, wait.

1157
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,070
And I was thinking that
she would get mad though.

1158
01:10:49,490 --> 01:10:53,270
Probably because if she did it like that,
cause that, well then she stops crying.

1159
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:57,950
Hey, hang in here for this
last one. [inaudible] happy.
No, I don't know. I honestly,

1160
01:10:57,951 --> 01:11:00,890
I have no idea what I can tell
you as a man, when a woman cries,

1161
01:11:00,891 --> 01:11:05,420
all we want you to do is to stop
crying. We don't give a fuck. Yes.

1162
01:11:05,450 --> 01:11:08,150
Completely fucking selfish when
it comes to our emotions. Yeah.

1163
01:11:08,151 --> 01:11:11,120
We know you're selfish when I yelled.
That's an emotion.

1164
01:11:11,121 --> 01:11:13,710
You want me to stop yelling?
Yelling.

1165
01:11:13,740 --> 01:11:17,730
Like hearing somebody yell
constantly is like traumatic. Okay.

1166
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:21,270
When somebody crow all the
time was also traumatic.

1167
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:24,300
It's like you want you to this sad
movie that never ends. It is. No,

1168
01:11:24,301 --> 01:11:28,260
that would be a real, she sounds
like a real drip. You know Jesus.

1169
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:33,810
All right, come on. That looks good.
Well, what can he do? I don't know.

1170
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:37,380
Oh boy. Oh boy, buddy.

1171
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,760
It sounds like that's just kinda
how she is. I mean, listen,

1172
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:45,090
I don't know if your religion
allows you to do this,

1173
01:11:45,091 --> 01:11:47,730
but I would get some
Bose wireless headphones,

1174
01:11:48,090 --> 01:11:50,760
the noise canceling ones who
whenever she starts crying,

1175
01:11:50,761 --> 01:11:53,640
I just put them on and put on
your favorite fucking music.

1176
01:11:53,641 --> 01:11:56,490
Can you ask her dad or her
mom or whatever? Like just,

1177
01:11:56,491 --> 01:12:00,240
I just feel like she's very
sensitive. She cries easily, you know?

1178
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,020
Is that, yeah. I don't
know. I wouldn't do that,

1179
01:12:04,550 --> 01:12:07,110
but they finally let her
talk on the fucking phone
and then you're going to come

1180
01:12:07,111 --> 01:12:10,950
and be like, yeah, you know? Can you tweak
here a little bit this way of, anyway,

1181
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:14,010
mom,
mom's comment on pizza leads to break up.

1182
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:18,300
Hey bill weekly listener loveF is for
family and all you stand up stuff.

1183
01:12:18,570 --> 01:12:22,560
Keep up the good work.
All right. My question is,

1184
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:27,370
what experiences have you had with
dating while going through our of, hey,

1185
01:12:27,371 --> 01:12:29,520
a rough term with your
professional career?

1186
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:32,280
Bill has never dated anyone besides me.

1187
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,250
I'm the only woman in his life that
matters and I really don't appreciate you

1188
01:12:35,251 --> 01:12:38,850
asking me about the people that came
before me. I got to tell you something.

1189
01:12:38,851 --> 01:12:42,450
I dated a lot of great women,
a lot of Hardee's.

1190
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:47,190
There were absolute animals in the rack.
Uh,

1191
01:12:47,370 --> 01:12:51,810
my girlfriend and I dated for three years
and recently decided to go on a break.

1192
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:54,720
Yeah. All right. You're breaking
up a, we met in law school,

1193
01:12:54,721 --> 01:12:58,440
both graduated with good grades
and each passed the bar exam.

1194
01:12:58,890 --> 01:13:03,210
The big difference between us is that
she got a job right after graduation with

1195
01:13:03,211 --> 01:13:07,980
the high salary and sane benefits
and located in a wealthy suburb.

1196
01:13:08,250 --> 01:13:12,030
This was largely due to a family
connection, which she openly admits. Yeah,

1197
01:13:12,031 --> 01:13:14,400
good for her. Use your
connection. Meanwhile,

1198
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:18,750
I hope to get hired by a firm I worked
at during my final year of law school,

1199
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:23,280
but was told at the last minute that
none of the interns would be hired you

1200
01:13:23,281 --> 01:13:26,490
fucking cunts.
Oh my God.

1201
01:13:26,770 --> 01:13:29,310
Fte sat there going through their card
catalog and whatever the fuck it is you

1202
01:13:29,311 --> 01:13:31,050
guys do.
As a result.

1203
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,380
I've been living with my parents for
the past three months, making money,

1204
01:13:37,381 --> 01:13:42,300
teaching tennis lessons while sending
resumes and traveling for interviews all

1205
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:43,134
over the state.

1206
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:47,580
The decision for a break came when my
girlfriend was visiting me at my parents'

1207
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:48,180
house.

1208
01:13:48,180 --> 01:13:52,830
She and I went out for pizza and came
back with some leftovers by girlfriend,

1209
01:13:52,831 --> 01:13:57,180
put the pizza in the fridge. But my
mom, who has a heavy Russian accent,

1210
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:01,620
told her that putting the pizza
in the fridge destroys the flavor.

1211
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:06,480
I did not even bat an eye
at the interaction and went
to the couch to watch a

1212
01:14:06,481 --> 01:14:10,530
hockey game. These guys live in the
life. He's living at home. He's teaching.

1213
01:14:10,531 --> 01:14:14,320
Tennessee's watching hockey is
eating pizza. I love this guy's life.

1214
01:14:15,070 --> 01:14:19,210
After an evening of my girlfriend moping
around, I asked her what was wrong.

1215
01:14:19,270 --> 01:14:20,140
According to her,

1216
01:14:20,141 --> 01:14:25,141
I failed to stand up for
her and was supposed to tell
my mom to not speak to her

1217
01:14:25,331 --> 01:14:26,164
that way.

1218
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:31,840
While the defense or her girlfriend not
to put the pizza in the fridge. Yeah,

1219
01:14:31,910 --> 01:14:36,340
but [inaudible] in defensive or though
the Russian accent is a little harsh,

1220
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:37,810
they can't help it.

1221
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:41,080
Even when they're being like happy
and friendly towards each other,

1222
01:14:41,081 --> 01:14:43,480
they sound like they're screaming at each
other. They want to murder each other.

1223
01:14:43,510 --> 01:14:46,660
Yeah. That they're going to send you to
the fucking gulag. Don't get mad at me.

1224
01:14:46,660 --> 01:14:47,830
You know that shit is true.

1225
01:14:47,831 --> 01:14:50,590
And like think about your grandparents
and your aunts and your uncles,

1226
01:14:50,591 --> 01:14:51,480
like when you went in the room,

1227
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:54,190
nobody gets mad at anything on
this podcast and yeah, I've,

1228
01:14:54,540 --> 01:14:58,420
I've curated some of the dumbest people
on this planet and we all just sit in

1229
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:02,230
there and fucking bubble of stupidity,
enjoying all of this. All right.

1230
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:06,760
After an evening of my girlfriend moping
around, I asked her what was wrong.

1231
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,070
Okay.
Coordinator,

1232
01:15:08,070 --> 01:15:12,880
what I failed to stand up
from was supposed to tell
my mom to not speak to her

1233
01:15:12,881 --> 01:15:16,180
that way. I know my mom could sound
a little harsh with her accent. Yeah.

1234
01:15:16,181 --> 01:15:18,670
There you go.
And sometimes uses incorrect words

1235
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:23,710
that you use your imagination
when speaking English.

1236
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:26,470
But the two have always
had a good relationship.

1237
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:29,500
So there was no reason to think
she would be upset by the comment.

1238
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,540
This started an argument about how
I've become a mama's boy. Oh boy. Oh,

1239
01:15:34,541 --> 01:15:39,541
she went there and that I'm
not the situation and then
I'm not desperate enough

1240
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:41,500
to move out of the house.

1241
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:44,603
Woo.

1242
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,460
Somebody's going to throw a chair soon.
Uh,

1243
01:15:48,590 --> 01:15:52,460
these comments really pissed me off
because she has personally seen the amount

1244
01:15:52,461 --> 01:15:55,520
of hard work and long hours I've
put into my schoolwork, internship,

1245
01:15:55,760 --> 01:16:00,650
passing the bar exam, and not to mention
she got a hookup and sending out resume.

1246
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:01,251
Additionally,

1247
01:16:01,251 --> 01:16:06,251
this came a day after I was informed that
I was close a close second for a job I

1248
01:16:06,381 --> 01:16:10,310
was excited about potentially
receiving. Yes. So this is it. Yeah.

1249
01:16:10,311 --> 01:16:13,670
You seem branches. You know, land is
common. You like Christopher Columbus.

1250
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:20,430
MMM. Nia was commenting on this all
natural ginger Ale. I actually like it.

1251
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:23,520
Oh my God. Hey. But really quickly,
can I just ask you a quick question?

1252
01:16:23,550 --> 01:16:26,920
Do you consider a Ginger Ale soda?
I thought you guys would be,

1253
01:16:26,921 --> 01:16:30,220
do I consider Ginger Ale
offensive offensive names?

1254
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:35,950
Do you consider Ginger Ale
soda? Yes. You do? Yes.

1255
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,010
Yeah. People that follow me on Twitter,
I'll know what I'm talking about.

1256
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,970
I did a poll on Twitter because I realized
that I don't consider a Ginger Ale

1257
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:48,390
soda was because you only drink it when
you have, uh, when you're, your stomach's.

1258
01:16:48,391 --> 01:16:51,960
Not Everybody was saying to me, but
you know, I'm obsessed with Ginger Ale,

1259
01:16:51,961 --> 01:16:56,810
so I drink it all the time.
But people seem to, yeah.

1260
01:16:57,070 --> 01:17:01,180
Why don't you consider it
soda? Oh No, I have no idea.

1261
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:05,740
I consider soda like coke and orange.
Do you consider an apple of fruit?

1262
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,280
No. Why not? I don't know.

1263
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:11,660
I know it's super obvious,

1264
01:17:11,661 --> 01:17:15,110
but I just never made the
connection that it would be soda.

1265
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:19,400
If you said that on a first date, I, there
would be no second date. That'd be like,

1266
01:17:19,401 --> 01:17:23,810
this is the fucking Bimbo.
Jesus.

1267
01:17:23,930 --> 01:17:28,010
I thought I was dumb. Yeah, that's okay.

1268
01:17:28,011 --> 01:17:31,600
I can look it up. Let's try that story
in the pockets. That girl one time like,

1269
01:17:31,670 --> 01:17:34,790
hey, you want to go out? You want to go
grab some Sushi or something some night?

1270
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:37,190
Oh my God,
I love Sushi.

1271
01:17:37,460 --> 01:17:40,520
But one time I ate it
every day for like a month.

1272
01:17:40,970 --> 01:17:44,840
And what do you call the white part of
your eye? I'm like, ah, the white party.

1273
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:49,490
Your eye. She got here, it
turned all yellow and I was like,

1274
01:17:49,491 --> 01:17:51,770
hey bitch had jaundice.
Yes.

1275
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:55,670
And I conveniently had another
call coming in that I had to take.

1276
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:00,800
Um, well, but even if you thought it was
a bimbo, I still try to go out with them.

1277
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,310
Like you are attracted to me.
I still try to go out with her though.

1278
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:10,670
She was an underwear model. She modeled
me undies, me on DC though. She did.

1279
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:16,670
Um, so anyway, uh, pizza, sorry
to interrupt. Okay, additionally,

1280
01:18:16,700 --> 01:18:18,230
okay, blah blah blah
blah. This came, okay.

1281
01:18:18,370 --> 01:18:21,110
So the guy was excited when I
suspect the real situations,

1282
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:26,111
my girlfriend has an image of who her
partner is and saw potential in me meeting

1283
01:18:26,271 --> 01:18:29,330
that image someday. But right now
I'm not living up to that image.

1284
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:34,780
It's like she's an NFL GM and I am the
potential franchise quarterback who still

1285
01:18:35,451 --> 01:18:39,620
needs to work on his arm strength before
becoming the starter in her eyes and

1286
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:43,820
boozing it up like Johnny football
instead of hitting the gym. Um,

1287
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:44,870
I gotta tell you something,
Dude,

1288
01:18:44,900 --> 01:18:49,900
I'd let this girl go and I have to say
something to do not fall in love with

1289
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:55,460
potential and is a trap. No, no.
She, well she's, she's funnel.

1290
01:18:55,590 --> 01:18:56,423
Let's listen.

1291
01:18:56,660 --> 01:18:59,120
That's what I'm saying is for her to
like fall in love with his potential is

1292
01:18:59,121 --> 01:19:03,320
it's not a good idea. So it's really
about, that's the end of the question.

1293
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:06,980
Yeah. He kind of knocked it off there.
I know. I gotta be honest with you.

1294
01:19:06,981 --> 01:19:09,870
I actually thought this guy was going
to do better with the question. Yeah.

1295
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:13,670
I believed in his potential
for this question more. Yeah.
But I didn't go nowhere.

1296
01:19:14,210 --> 01:19:17,510
I think you grow couch,
Yo. Oh, I wouldn't say,

1297
01:19:17,511 --> 01:19:21,500
I think you'd grow from
making a point here. Um, yeah,

1298
01:19:21,501 --> 01:19:23,780
so clearly it's not about the pizza.

1299
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:29,120
It's about like the bigger picture
for him and where he's at in her life.

1300
01:19:29,121 --> 01:19:30,530
And she's not,
she is like,

1301
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:35,360
she's a spoiled Brat who just got a job
gifted to her so she doesn't understand

1302
01:19:35,361 --> 01:19:37,730
why she's still like good at it though.
Right?

1303
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:41,330
Like it's not as if she just got
it and she sucks at it. I know,

1304
01:19:41,331 --> 01:19:42,380
but you know something he didn't,

1305
01:19:42,410 --> 01:19:45,560
he didn't say that he brought that up
cause I would have brought that up still

1306
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:48,430
living labs. I'm sorry. I don't
fucking come from the Goddamn Walton's.

1307
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:51,710
What are the, who's a big lawyer
family on TV with a Waltons lawyers.

1308
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:56,890
Cliff Huxtable was, did you ever
watch the Waltons Clair Huxtable.

1309
01:19:57,620 --> 01:20:01,290
The Waltons was the Cosby show for
white people. What is the Walton,

1310
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:04,990
it's just a bunch of fucking
rednecks living in an old farm house.

1311
01:20:05,140 --> 01:20:08,640
It was like 90 of them. They all have
fucking overalls. Sounds terrible.

1312
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:14,460
What do you have against white people in
overalls? Fucking dilapidated buildings.

1313
01:20:15,420 --> 01:20:18,840
Can I John boy. Um,
that's that show. Yeah.

1314
01:20:19,810 --> 01:20:24,510
Denied whoever. Goodnight zones. Yeah.
Good, good. Good night. Mary sue.

1315
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:29,610
All right. Bobby Jo, can I, John
Boy, John Boy who was John Boy.

1316
01:20:30,270 --> 01:20:33,420
John boy was like the fucking
oldest dude on, he was like a man.

1317
01:20:33,421 --> 01:20:35,760
He was like a young man,
but he was a boy.

1318
01:20:35,970 --> 01:20:39,720
John Boy is his dad John Too.
And he's John Man.

1319
01:20:39,990 --> 01:20:44,730
He's John Man.
We're not answering this guy's question.

1320
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:48,450
I asked the question, there
is no question, but uh,

1321
01:20:48,690 --> 01:20:51,210
I think he just wants me to comment
on the situation. I have no idea,

1322
01:20:51,211 --> 01:20:54,930
but I would just say that,
um,

1323
01:20:56,220 --> 01:20:59,490
I would like, which, why would you
support me when I'm down? How about you?

1324
01:20:59,491 --> 01:21:02,130
How about your potential to be
a loving and supportive spouse?

1325
01:21:02,131 --> 01:21:03,840
Like why are you kicking me when I'm down?
Like,

1326
01:21:03,841 --> 01:21:06,450
don't you think that I'm trying to
make it happen? Don't you think?

1327
01:21:06,451 --> 01:21:09,810
I want to impress you. Don't you
think I want to be like, you know,

1328
01:21:10,500 --> 01:21:13,770
the man that like, you know, is, is
everything that you've ever dreamed of.

1329
01:21:13,771 --> 01:21:15,540
I'm having a hard time
right now. Like, you know,

1330
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:19,380
why have that fucking four hour debate
when you could just break up with

1331
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:21,720
somebody?
I see too many red flags here,

1332
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,580
too many fucking red flags there.
First of all, they're both lawyers.

1333
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:30,910
Okay. You can argue it out all
night long. Since they loved,

1334
01:21:31,020 --> 01:21:33,960
are they going to be competitive
there were in the same fucking field.

1335
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:38,730
Then it's posted and then she gets fucking
pregnant and like who the fuck puts

1336
01:21:38,731 --> 01:21:40,980
their fucking practice on hold?

1337
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:44,760
You know you would have to
obviously if she's carrying a baby,

1338
01:21:44,761 --> 01:21:48,510
like that's Kinda how it goes. Yeah. And
like she should be loving. So she's like,

1339
01:21:48,511 --> 01:21:51,180
so get your shit together because
eventually when we have a family,

1340
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:53,390
I'm going to have to take
time. Fuck that bitch. She,

1341
01:21:53,391 --> 01:21:57,330
she seems like the Alpha male here in
this and I think that she's going to want

1342
01:21:57,331 --> 01:22:00,420
to keep working alpha
and then this guy can,

1343
01:22:00,630 --> 01:22:04,530
this guy can just fucking chill
out with the kids teaching tennis.

1344
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:10,170
Yeah. I mean it's not like he doesn't
have a job. He's looking for a job.

1345
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:15,180
He almost got one. Okay, well
keep at it. Keep your chin up.

1346
01:22:17,820 --> 01:22:21,360
I don't know both of these
people's on annoying. Why?

1347
01:22:21,420 --> 01:22:26,160
How is he annoying Boba?
Knowing he's like, I'm playing
tennis, I'm doing my best.

1348
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:30,620
And she's like, get into gangs,
teaching tennis, whatever he's trying.

1349
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:32,910
He's making money. He ever,
she had to play it to teach it.

1350
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:35,913
Ooh.

1351
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,940
You're like killing in
your own head right now.

1352
01:22:41,941 --> 01:22:45,730
I don't know what's going on with you.
You find yourself very amusing. Alright.

1353
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:50,420
I do. Right. You know
something. All right.

1354
01:22:50,490 --> 01:22:54,390
I almost started crying like that guy's
fucking PR potential. Fucking wife,

1355
01:22:54,900 --> 01:22:59,400
his wife. Um, all right. That is the
podcast. I don't know if I helped anybody.

1356
01:22:59,460 --> 01:23:00,930
I don't even know when I talked about,

1357
01:23:01,470 --> 01:23:05,500
I want to thank everybody who came out
in Albuquerque and people who came out in

1358
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:08,410
Tucson,
Arizona at fucking Dean del Rey.

1359
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:11,740
Jesus Christ has been fucking murder and
in front of me. That's awesome. Yeah.

1360
01:23:11,741 --> 01:23:13,960
Like people is like an
audible like, Nah. When he's,

1361
01:23:13,961 --> 01:23:17,690
when he's fucking sets over to
knowing he's making me work out there,

1362
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,980
crushing it, deans the best. Uh,

1363
01:23:21,981 --> 01:23:25,290
and I will be with Dean
next Sunday night oven.

1364
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,330
Santa fucking Barbara said,

1365
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:30,460
I want to go.

1366
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:35,840
You go out and spend the money that you're
earning and go look at stuff you fuck

1367
01:23:37,300 --> 01:23:40,540
you and has nothing to do with.
What do you want to do in Santa Barbara?

1368
01:23:40,570 --> 01:23:44,700
I want to go and hang out and sees
in a and how much does that cost you?

1369
01:23:44,920 --> 01:23:48,340
It doesn't cost anything for me to
like see cause I'm paying for it.

1370
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:51,880
Paying for what exactly?
The trip to Santa Barbara.

1371
01:23:51,910 --> 01:23:55,720
You are working in Santa Barbara and I'm
tagging along with you like what is the

1372
01:23:55,721 --> 01:23:58,210
problem? You just don't what? You
don't want me to cramp your style?

1373
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:01,520
What do you and dean and I go, go dude's
like skipping to the vineyards together.

1374
01:24:01,630 --> 01:24:05,320
Then I'd go to a fucking brothel.
What do you think we're going to do again?

1375
01:24:05,321 --> 01:24:08,020
You're going to be there being
like, oop, you wear a condom.

1376
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:10,330
I don't need that shit.
Listen,

1377
01:24:10,331 --> 01:24:14,230
if you can try to with that fucking second
grade manipulation to try to turn the

1378
01:24:14,231 --> 01:24:17,950
conversation into that goddamn direction.
I'm just going to steer into Nia.

1379
01:24:18,100 --> 01:24:21,520
Why wouldn't I be able to come to
Santa Barbara? It's a beautiful place.

1380
01:24:21,521 --> 01:24:24,070
I haven't been there in years.
Like what is the problem?

1381
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:28,990
I'll tell you what the problem is
because fuck you. Fuck me. Why?

1382
01:24:29,020 --> 01:24:33,280
Because you only because you only
support me when I go to fun places.

1383
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:37,930
You never there when I need you. When
I go to, when I go to Sacramento,

1384
01:24:38,060 --> 01:24:41,380
you never want to tag along.
I would potentially go to Sacramento.

1385
01:24:41,381 --> 01:24:44,830
I mean it is the capital of what?
California.

1386
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,703
Okay.

1387
01:24:49,660 --> 01:24:53,590
Why would I go to a not fun city?
Like why would I do that?

1388
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:59,020
Why would I need you to come along to
a fun city? I'm already having fun.

1389
01:24:59,110 --> 01:25:00,970
You love when I come on the row with you.

1390
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,160
That's why I traveled so much
with you before us and he had,

1391
01:25:03,161 --> 01:25:08,010
these are things I say to keep the
relationship going on your podcast like I

1392
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:10,480
that you don't enjoy me being there
with you and you're on the road.

1393
01:25:10,570 --> 01:25:15,180
The Woolies lowly, the road who I
lose you. Oh, here's the baby. Like

1394
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:20,950
you're so in control controlling.
You're just like the man of the family.

1395
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,950
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1396
01:25:24,040 --> 01:25:28,630
Love when I'm there with you on the
road. So knock it off. Timeout. Timeout.

1397
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,640
You're talking a lot of shit.

1398
01:25:30,940 --> 01:25:34,060
I didn't get lonely on the road
like this until I had a daughter.

1399
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:39,220
Oh my God. Are you, are you see what
I did? A three week fucking run.

1400
01:25:39,310 --> 01:25:43,930
Are you suggesting that you
were not lonely on the road
before we had a daughter?

1401
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,150
Are you saying for the most part,
yeah.

1402
01:25:46,460 --> 01:25:50,120
You didn't miss me when you're on
the road for the most part, yes. Oh,

1403
01:25:50,230 --> 01:25:54,460
so then who are you lying to you?
You so you feel better?

1404
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:58,330
That's completely untrue. Yeah. Have
you ever seen what I do on the road?

1405
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:01,480
I go to steams. I go to games.
I'm hanging out with my friends.

1406
01:26:01,481 --> 01:26:02,740
I'm riding on a bus.
It's fucking,

1407
01:26:03,500 --> 01:26:06,290
the whole game thing is you've got to
make your wife feel like you're not having

1408
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:10,140
a good time out there. She's going
to get upset. Are you serious?

1409
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,480
A lot of the times, yeah.
Oh my God, no, but now that,

1410
01:26:15,481 --> 01:26:20,010
now that I have a kid, it's
different you, so you never miss me.

1411
01:26:20,010 --> 01:26:23,010
When you were on the road all those nights
that you called me and said you were

1412
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:24,080
lonely and was,

1413
01:26:24,100 --> 01:26:27,590
I was here and you'd saw something funny
and you're sending me a lot of those

1414
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:31,910
times all day and text messages all
day like I miss you. Check this out.

1415
01:26:31,911 --> 01:26:36,320
Isn't this funny, blah, blah,
blah, blah, and like you,
that was a lot of those times.

1416
01:26:36,990 --> 01:26:41,240
A lot of the times it's bullshit you.
Almost 15 years. That's all been bullshit.

1417
01:26:41,270 --> 01:26:44,170
Not all, but a lot of it is
bullshit. I don't believe you.

1418
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,560
That's how you do the road as a guy.
I don't believe you.

1419
01:26:48,280 --> 01:26:51,630
I will never trust you
again. If this is true, man,

1420
01:26:51,970 --> 01:26:53,290
you going to sit and
I'm going to Milwaukee.

1421
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:57,430
I'm seeing the Henry Winkler's statue.
I'm going Fonzie,

1422
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:01,180
I'm going to the fucking,
the Harley Davidson Museum.

1423
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:04,540
They have a statue of
him. Why? What did he do?

1424
01:27:04,870 --> 01:27:08,740
Cause happy days was filmed in front of
a live audience to the audience there,

1425
01:27:09,340 --> 01:27:12,730
but it's not like it's rocky.
Do they really have a statue of him?

1426
01:27:13,980 --> 01:27:14,813
Yeah.

1427
01:27:17,090 --> 01:27:18,590
Seemed like a waste of a statue.

1428
01:27:24,210 --> 01:27:25,043
Okay.

1429
01:27:25,480 --> 01:27:28,820
It's like the funniest thing ever.
A waste of a statue.

1430
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:31,670
The statue could have been something else.

1431
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:34,460
Say What are you going to chop their
head off and put fucking Merv Griffin's

1432
01:27:34,640 --> 01:27:35,473
head on?
There

1433
01:27:36,530 --> 01:27:40,160
is that character that iconic
that it deserves its own statue.

1434
01:27:40,190 --> 01:27:41,570
A that guy.

1435
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:50,720
That's why I love Milwaukee.
That's why I love Milwaukee.

1436
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,760
That's why I love Milwaukee's cause they,

1437
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:58,730
it's a city but it's small town.
God Milwaukee,

1438
01:27:58,820 --> 01:27:59,653
you got to do better.

1439
01:28:02,130 --> 01:28:02,963
Oh.

1440
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:10,500
Oh Nia. So me. That's one of
my favorite fucking cities.

1441
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:11,860
Okay.

1442
01:28:11,860 --> 01:28:15,010
I love Milwaukee.
You know what Milwaukee Euro k with me.

1443
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:16,523

1444

All right. Near this is the, of course
I met you on the road. I love you.

But this,

1446
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:24,560
there's times where I'm really
having a good fucking time out there.

1447
01:28:25,320 --> 01:28:30,200
So you have to text. Hey
honey, I'm thinking about you.
I'm not thinking about you.

1448
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,000
I'm,
I'm watching SCC football.

1449
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:36,980
I sometimes forget I'm married
when I'm at those games. I get it.

1450
01:28:36,981 --> 01:28:38,310
You don't have to keep like,
you know,

1451
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,960
don't because you went so hard the
other way. Go the news too. Like,

1452
01:28:41,961 --> 01:28:46,710

1453
01:28:46,850 --> 01:28:51,580

me now I get it. So it was self serving.

1454

the road like you and you know,

1456
01:28:58,630 --> 01:29:02,730

some sort. So I get it. I understand.
