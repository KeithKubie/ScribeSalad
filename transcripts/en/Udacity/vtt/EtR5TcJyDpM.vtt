00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.960
I'm here with Aaron Harris,
a partner at Y-Combinator,

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.698
one of the best accelerators
around the world.

00:00:05.698 --> 00:00:10.180
Before joining Y-Combinator,
Aaron was founder of Tutorspree,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.060
an online service that
connected tutors and students.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.240
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.170
&gt;&gt; My pleasure, thanks for having me.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.230
&gt;&gt; So
let's start with a personal question.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.740
How did you come up with the idea for
Tutorspree?

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.680
Well, it was actually initially
my co-founder Josh's idea.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.410
He had this thought that we were
going to build an online platform for

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.770
people to buy and sell their time, and
that kind of lent itself to tutoring.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.662
And the first way he
pitched it to me was,

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:38.820
it's this online platform that
will buy and sell time in any way.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.400
I said, that's a stupid idea, because
it just sounded too broad and general.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.720
As we started thinking about it,
the thing we realized

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.260
was that tutoring was kind of a perfect
fit for what we were talking about.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.710
I had tutored in high school and
in college, I'd had tutors.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.080
I had a lot of friends who
are professional tutors.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.650
We kind of talked to
them about this idea,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.450
we started uncovering these
things that they actually needed.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.129
And that's what
influenced us to sort of,

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.720
I guess, iterate our way towards
what Tutorspree became over time.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.830
&gt;&gt; You think this is common for
every founder?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.030
Do funders in Y-Combinator,
this is how to do it?

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.560
&gt;&gt; It should be.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.670
It isn't necessarily always.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.261
Sometimes people come to us with
ideas that are kind of made up.

00:01:23.261 --> 00:01:25.687
We call them sometimes solutions
in search of problems,

00:01:25.687 --> 00:01:28.567
where people just have this really
interesting technical idea that

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.450
doesn't actually relate to any problems.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.740
But I think the best ideas tend
to come from problems that people

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.700
themselves experience.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.190
So in that way I actually think
Tutorspree probably wasn't

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.720
the best idea we could have done.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.080
I wasn't a professional tutor,
neither were my co-founders.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.870
So there were things that
we didn't quite understand.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.385
We also weren't parents which
was kind of our target market.

00:01:48.385 --> 00:01:50.800
We didn't have kids go
through the process.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.910
So while we learned a lot through
customer conversations and

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.822
watching how people acted,
I think we missed things.

00:01:56.822 --> 00:02:00.298
&gt;&gt; So how do Y-Combinator
companies come up with their idea?

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:05.840
&gt;&gt; I don't think there's any one, single
way that founders come up with the idea.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.810
But there is a common thread between
the best of them, which is that people

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.100
are solving problems that they have,
problems that they really understand.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.200
I think Dropbox is
a great example of this,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.280
where Drew got annoyed of carrying
files around on a USB stick, right?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.120
It's crazy, you have one on your keys.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.820
It's a crazy way to carry files around
in a world where we have the Internet

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.900
and cloud storage.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.199
Now, in 2005, 6,
2007 when he was starting this,

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:34.110
remember, this concept didn't exist.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.879
When I first got my Gmail account,
I had to know the Gmail beta in 2005.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.515
I used it as cloud storage.

00:02:40.515 --> 00:02:41.410
I just realized this today,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.480
I was thinking like when was
the first time I used cloud storage?

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.950
I would send copies of my thesis to
myself, right, from my Harvard address,

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.250
just so I had a copy somewhere
in case my computer crashed or

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.100
in case I needed to print it up.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.830
That's such a silly thing to do.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.370
Email is not designed for that.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.935
But that was the only way really to do,
so

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:03.780
he said I'm going to go one step
further and Dropbox was born.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.946
&gt;&gt; Right.
And what do you look in when you look

00:03:05.946 --> 00:03:08.049
at applications to Y-Combinator?

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.310
What do you look in, in terms of ideas?

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.510
&gt;&gt; In terms of the idea or
the founder that we want to accept?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.982
&gt;&gt; So, our thinking on this, I guess, my
thinking on this has changed over time,

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:21.590
and I think the same is
true of my partners.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.130
I think we used to say that founders
were the only thing that mattered.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.490
Idea was important, but
mostly as an informed founders.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.930
A lot of other people will tell
you it's all about the idea.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.190
I think all these things
are probably too clear cut, or

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.130
it's not that black and white.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.450
I think you need both founders and
ideas.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.220
Because if you just take founders
who seem really great but

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.900
they don't have good ideas,
they're probably not great founders.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.810
because great founders have ideas
of what they're going to work on.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.040
And if you take something that just
seems like a really great idea and

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.180
the founders don't seem great,

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.690
they're probably not going to
be able to execute it.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.880
So I wish I had a clean answer but
the truth is, it's both.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.260
And so we're looking for founders who
seem really great and formidable.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.300
And the truth is,
we're not looking necessarily for

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.670
the most intelligent founders,
because that's actually not the thing.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.150
It's not pure horsepower.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.810
It's not intellectual horsepower.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.100
It's are you smart
enough to get this done?

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.617
But more importantly,
do you have the determination and

00:04:19.617 --> 00:04:23.583
the drive to just go through brick
wall after brick wall to do it?

00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:26.975
Because let's face it, you're going to
screw up again and again, and even if

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:30.660
you don't screw up, things aren't
going to work out the way you wanted.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.202
And if you can't go through that,
you're in trouble.

00:04:32.202 --> 00:04:33.395
On the other hand,

00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:37.795
if your idea is something that has
no chance of being a large business,

00:04:37.795 --> 00:04:42.360
It doesn't matter if you're the most
determined founder in the world.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.550
It's not going to go anywhere.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:44.050
&gt;&gt; Right.
