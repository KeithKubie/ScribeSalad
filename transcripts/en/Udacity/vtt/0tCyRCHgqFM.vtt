00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.430
&gt;&gt; We're going to have a final project in

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.130
this course where you're going to have a chance

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:05.480
to apply everything that you've learned to a sample

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.500
web site. By the time you're done, you should be

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.420
able to take that web site to a Page

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.400
Speed score of 90 or higher. We'll have the project

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.000
up on GitHub and you can find the instructions

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.990
for how to get that setup in the instructor notes.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.970
&gt;&gt; Also, when you're working on a portfolio, don't just leave

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.570
my information in there. Customize it to show off your own projects.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.960
You can find instructions for how to

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.810
customize it also within the Instructor notes.
