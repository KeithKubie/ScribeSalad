00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.110
In this lesson, we discussed if conversion, where

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.939
we convert difficult-to-predict branches into code that is

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.490
longer but has no branches. We also learned

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.560
about special instructions that we need for if conversion

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:19.220
to work. Now that we are up to speed with how control hazards are handled, we

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.030
need to learn how to handle data hazards

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.860
while keeping a good instruction flow in our pipeline.
