00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.460
I'm so like relieved that I finally
made it.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.840
It just feels so amazing you know to look around and say that I was a school like this.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.840
Here we are

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.800
about to graduate with everything that I wanted to do here.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.840
It was a long journey. I feel accomplished.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.280
I am the first in my family to graduate.
It's going to be something very huge.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.480
My toughest point was actually my first
quarter here.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.000
So I didn't have very good study habits.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.120
First year was kind of
hard figuring out how to study and stuff.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.380
My first quarter here after I transferred.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.720
First year was a very big struggle.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.080
Things like kept rolling like and you had no
time to stop.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.200
You get a midterm score back that's not what you wanted.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.480
46%

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.740
I didn't do better on the final.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.100
There was definitely times where I wanted to give up.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.420
You push through for
sure.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.040
I was just like staying up till 2:00 a.m. 3:00a.m. trying to finish.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.500
I gave birth to my daughter and I just remember

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.840
thinking oh my god I don't think I'm
gonna be able to do this.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
Hit the office hours. I was there like every office hour afterwards.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.720
Going in to your T.A.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.520
I had to make a lot of sacrifices and like
really learn how to manage my time.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.020
I'll start by thanking my family of
course.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.920
My parents.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
Love to thank my parents.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.920
Definitely my parents. I mean
that's pretty generic but they helped me

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.080
the most through my trek.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.600
My husband so
much.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.060
Having the same group of friends over the past four years.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.560
Ellie HernÃ¡ndez from the Chicano Studies department.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.420
My community college teachers.
They said like you'll thank me one day

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.740
for pushing you this hard.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.820
I feel like the resources here at UCLA like the AAP it definitely helped me.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.520
Dan Blumstein. It's just been nice to have his constant advice.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.380
Life happens but
that doesn't mean you stop trying and stop

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.520
like doing what it is that you want.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.480
Whenever people ask me what your school is it's nice to be able to say UCLA.
