00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.710
December 5, 1948
in New Mexico,

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.120
two different sightings
by aircraft that

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.710
were in the area at the time.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.330
The first was an Air
Force C-47 transport

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.920
plane which was in the vicinity
of Kirtland Air Force Base.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.830
The pilot and other
crew saw this object

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.170
that was greenish luminescent,
totally unidentifiable.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.250
And then shortly after that
there was a commercial flight

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.920
that radioed into
Kirtland Air Force Base

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.670
as well, essentially do
you have this on radar?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.040
Are you tracking
anything like this?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.420
We're seeing something
very, very unusual.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.580
That was the beginning of these
so-called green fireballs.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.210
And, in fact, throughout
December of 1948,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.380
more than half of the
remaining days in the year

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.080
had sightings of
these fireballs.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.380
I remember it happened in 1948
in Albuquerque, in the region

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.750
around Albuquerque,
which of course

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.120
was ground zero for a lot
of the atomic experiments.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.790
So people were concerned.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.120
One of the first questions
that people were asking

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.620
is are the Russians doing this?

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.790
And a lot of scientists--

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.460
the scientists themselves that
were charged with studying it

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.040
were often witnesses of it,
and a lot of military personnel

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.460
were certainly witnesses
to this phenomenon.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.960
But the reality is that there's
no evidence that the Russians

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.080
had anything to do with these
so-called green fireballs,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.250
and no one was able to find
out what these things were.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.120
There were theories that these
were meteors of some sort.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.120
The top meteorologist
in the country, a man

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.170
named Dr. Lincoln LaPaz did a
great amount of study of this

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.670
on behalf of the
United States military

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.790
and government of these
so-called green fireballs.

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.790
And the problem is LaPaz never
found any evidence that these

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.620
were meteoric in any way.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.670
There's no impact sites
that were ever found.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.500
There was no other evidence,
anything to come to show

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.830
that these were meteorites.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.500
So that was a problem.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.000
JACQUES VALLEE: Dr. Hynek knew
Dr. LaPaz and respected him,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.170
and that was something
that we discussed.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.670
But there was no
obvious explanation,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.830
and it didn't
continue after 1948.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.170
So the question is still open.
