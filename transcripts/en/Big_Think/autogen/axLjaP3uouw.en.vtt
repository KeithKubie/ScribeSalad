some consequences you know that gives us
 

00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.780
some consequences you know that gives us
a little free action and then we then

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:10.790
a little free action and then we then
 

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.370
a little free action and then we then
enhance the feedback and enhancing the

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:12.380
enhance the feedback and enhancing the

riffing off of that a bit I think that

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:38.180
riffing off of that a bit I think that
 

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.310
riffing off of that a bit I think that
also the other way the games are

00:24:39.310 --> 00:24:39.320
also the other way the games are
 

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.830
also the other way the games are
changing the way we are as a society is

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:41.840
changing the way we are as a society is
 

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:45.460
changing the way we are as a society is
that games have multi-variant inputs so

00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:45.470
that games have multi-variant inputs so
 

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.720
that games have multi-variant inputs so
especially simulation games so you've

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:46.730
especially simulation games so you've
 

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.820
especially simulation games so you've
got multiple things coming in and you

00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:48.830
got multiple things coming in and you
 

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.820
got multiple things coming in and you
have the ability to to to make a lot of

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:51.830
have the ability to to to make a lot of
 

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:53.890
have the ability to to to make a lot of
changes so in a sense simulation games

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:53.900
changes so in a sense simulation games
 

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.240
changes so in a sense simulation games
are really have the opportunity to

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:55.250
are really have the opportunity to
 

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:57.430
are really have the opportunity to
change the world to really educate us as

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:57.440
change the world to really educate us as
 

00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:59.560
change the world to really educate us as
global citizens because what our

00:24:59.560 --> 00:24:59.570
global citizens because what our
 

00:24:59.570 --> 00:25:02.980
global citizens because what our
simulation games are they are a they

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:02.990
simulation games are they are a they
 

00:25:02.990 --> 00:25:04.300
simulation games are they are a they
have multivariate inputs and

00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:04.310
have multivariate inputs and
 

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.980
have multivariate inputs and
multivariant outputs so when I play

00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:05.990
multivariant outputs so when I play
 

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:08.020
multivariant outputs so when I play
simcity I play a city manager and I you

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:08.030
simcity I play a city manager and I you
 

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:10.060
simcity I play a city manager and I you
make decisions you know and I can make

00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:10.070
make decisions you know and I can make
 

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:11.590
make decisions you know and I can make
decisions yet related to Godzilla or I

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:11.600
decisions yet related to Godzilla or I
 

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:13.060
decisions yet related to Godzilla or I
can make decisions to earthquake or fire

00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:13.070
can make decisions to earthquake or fire
 

00:25:13.070 --> 00:25:15.070
can make decisions to earthquake or fire
or I can you build it up but when you're

00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:15.080
or I can you build it up but when you're
 

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.110
or I can you build it up but when you're
done with the same city you actually

00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120
done with the same city you actually
 

00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:18.700
done with the same city you actually
know a little bit more about that you

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:18.710
know a little bit more about that you
 

00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:20.350
know a little bit more about that you
know a little more that world and what

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360
know a little more that world and what
 

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.790
know a little more that world and what
do we need what we really need right now

00:25:21.790 --> 00:25:21.800
do we need what we really need right now
 

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.170
do we need what we really need right now
are people who can understand

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:23.180
are people who can understand
 

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.330
are people who can understand
multi-variant systems to fight things

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:25.340
multi-variant systems to fight things
 

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.460
multi-variant systems to fight things
like global warming aids all of these

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:27.470
like global warming aids all of these
 

00:25:27.470 --> 00:25:29.620
like global warming aids all of these
problems we've pretty much dealt with a

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:29.630
problems we've pretty much dealt with a
 

00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:32.050
problems we've pretty much dealt with a
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so

00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:32.060
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so
 

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.000
lot of the low-hanging fruit here and so
you know i think the games play a really

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:34.010
you know i think the games play a really
 

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:35.950
you know i think the games play a really
serious role really important role in

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960
serious role really important role in
 

00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.170
serious role really important role in
elevating up our thinking to that next

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:38.180
elevating up our thinking to that next
 

00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:40.540
elevating up our thinking to that next
level of play and i think if we can do

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:40.550
level of play and i think if we can do
 

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:41.620
level of play and i think if we can do
that the world will definitely be a

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:41.630
that the world will definitely be a
 

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:45.090
that the world will definitely be a
better place

00:25:45.090 --> 00:25:45.100
 

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.200
growing up as a kid one of my favorite

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:48.210
growing up as a kid one of my favorite
 

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:51.029
growing up as a kid one of my favorite
wanted as a kid the thing that dropped

00:25:51.029 --> 00:25:51.039
wanted as a kid the thing that dropped
 

00:25:51.039 --> 00:25:53.549
wanted as a kid the thing that dropped
had me drop the most quarters was Star

00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559
had me drop the most quarters was Star
 

00:25:53.559 --> 00:25:56.789
had me drop the most quarters was Star
Wars the star was fights him I love the

00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799
Wars the star was fights him I love the
 

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:59.010
Wars the star was fights him I love the
the feeling of flying I love that that

00:25:59.010 --> 00:25:59.020
the feeling of flying I love that that
 

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.270
the feeling of flying I love that that
whole experience I felt like I was this

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:00.280
whole experience I felt like I was this
 

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.590
whole experience I felt like I was this
you know fighter pilot and I was you

00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600
you know fighter pilot and I was you
 

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:03.330
you know fighter pilot and I was you
know racing and I never got past level

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:03.340
know racing and I never got past level
 

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:05.010
know racing and I never got past level
seven but you know I love the way the

00:26:05.010 --> 00:26:05.020
seven but you know I love the way the
 

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.480
seven but you know I love the way the
audio came in i was in that universe

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:06.490
audio came in i was in that universe
 

00:26:06.490 --> 00:26:08.490
audio came in i was in that universe
even though it was only wireframe at the

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:08.500
even though it was only wireframe at the
 

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:09.930
even though it was only wireframe at the
time there's a wireframe kind of you

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:09.940
time there's a wireframe kind of you
 

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:12.720
time there's a wireframe kind of you
know flight sim and that that that

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:12.730
know flight sim and that that that
 

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.700
know flight sim and that that that
experience allowed me to extend my love

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:14.710
experience allowed me to extend my love
 

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.260
experience allowed me to extend my love
of the whole Star Wars universe which

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:16.270
of the whole Star Wars universe which
 

00:26:16.270 --> 00:26:17.820
of the whole Star Wars universe which
again was this you know this fan at this

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:17.830
again was this you know this fan at this
 

00:26:17.830 --> 00:26:19.230
again was this you know this fan at this
aspirational fantasy so it really

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:19.240
aspirational fantasy so it really
 

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:23.850
aspirational fantasy so it really
connected it you know yo for me and I

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:23.860
connected it you know yo for me and I
 

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:24.930
connected it you know yo for me and I
think that would be yeah that would

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:24.940
think that would be yeah that would
 

00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:27.900
think that would be yeah that would
definitely be my favorite game
