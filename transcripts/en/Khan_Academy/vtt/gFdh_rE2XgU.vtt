00:00:00.936 --> 00:00:03.003
- [Instructor] The graphs of
the linear function f of x

00:00:03.003 --> 00:00:04.380
is equal to mx plus b

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.569
and the exponential function g of x

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.168
is equal to a times r to the x

00:00:09.168 --> 00:00:11.067
where r is greater than zero

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.564
pass through the points
negative one comma nine,

00:00:14.564 --> 00:00:16.801
so this is negative one
comma nine right over here,

00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:18.352
and one comma one.

00:00:18.352 --> 00:00:19.906
Both graphs are given below.

00:00:19.906 --> 00:00:22.575
So this very clearly
is the linear function.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.835
It is a line right over here.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:28.545
And this right over here is
the exponential function,

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:30.444
so right over here.

00:00:30.444 --> 00:00:34.037
And given the fact that
this exponential function

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:38.227
keeps decreasing as x gets
larger and larger and larger

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:40.942
is a pretty good hint that
our r right over here,

00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:42.488
they tell us that r is greater than zero,

00:00:42.488 --> 00:00:43.321
but it's a pretty good hint

00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:46.268
that r is going to be
between zero and one.

00:00:46.268 --> 00:00:48.817
The fact that g of x keeps approaching,

00:00:48.817 --> 00:00:50.970
it's getting closer and
closer and closer to zero

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.303
as x increases.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:55.260
But let's use the data they're giving us,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.945
the two points of intersection,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.995
to figure out what the equations
of these two functions are.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.472
So first we can tackle
the linear function.

00:01:03.472 --> 00:01:06.389
So f of x is equal to mx plus b.

00:01:08.477 --> 00:01:09.767
So they give us two points.

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:12.887
We could use those points
first to figure out the slope.

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:17.466
So our m, our m right over
here, that's our slope.

00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:20.371
That's our change in y over change in x.

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.216
The rate and change of the vertical axis

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:24.490
with respect to the horizontal axis.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.060
So let's see, between those two points,

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.153
what is our change in x?

00:01:29.153 --> 00:01:30.486
Our change in x,

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:35.620
we're going from x equals
negative one to x equals one.

00:01:38.223 --> 00:01:39.211
X equals one.

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:41.836
So we could think of it
as we're finishing at one.

00:01:41.836 --> 00:01:43.729
We started at negative one.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.647
So one minus negative one,
our change in x is two.

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:49.318
We see that right over there.

00:01:49.318 --> 00:01:51.405
And what about our change in y?

00:01:51.405 --> 00:01:53.681
Well, we start at nine.

00:01:53.681 --> 00:01:55.497
Let me do this in maybe
another color here.

00:01:55.497 --> 00:01:58.747
We start at nine, and we end up at one.

00:02:01.379 --> 00:02:03.157
So we end up at one.

00:02:03.157 --> 00:02:04.698
We started at nine.

00:02:04.698 --> 00:02:08.096
One minus nine is negative eight.

00:02:08.096 --> 00:02:12.179
And just to be clear,
when x is one, y is one.

00:02:15.846 --> 00:02:18.929
When x is negative one, y is nine.

00:02:21.297 --> 00:02:22.619
Another way to think about it,

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:24.002
the way I drew it right over here,

00:02:24.002 --> 00:02:26.713
we're finishing at x
equals one, y equals one.

00:02:26.713 --> 00:02:31.209
We started at x equals
negative one, y equals nine,

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.863
and so we just took the differences.

00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:34.883
We get negative eight over two,

00:02:34.883 --> 00:02:37.263
which is equal to negative four.

00:02:37.263 --> 00:02:39.410
Which is equal to negative four.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.327
And so now we can write that f of x

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.171
is equal to negative four,

00:02:46.171 --> 00:02:50.117
negative four, that's our slope, times x.

00:02:50.117 --> 00:02:52.784
Negative four times x plus b.

00:02:53.825 --> 00:02:55.729
And you can see that
slope right over here.

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.312
Every time you increase your...

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.769
Every time you increase your x by one.

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.704
I gotta be careful here,
I got a little bit.

00:03:09.704 --> 00:03:12.546
Every time you increase your x by one,

00:03:12.546 --> 00:03:14.719
you're decreasing your y.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:18.320
And here on the x axis,
we're marking off every half.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.672
So every time you increase your x by one,

00:03:20.672 --> 00:03:23.051
you are decreasing your y.

00:03:23.051 --> 00:03:25.504
You are decreasing your y by four there,

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:29.135
so that makes sense that
the slope is negative four.

00:03:29.135 --> 00:03:31.678
So now let's think about what b is.

00:03:31.678 --> 00:03:34.628
So to figure out b, we could
use either one of these points

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:37.682
to figure out, given an x, what f of x is,

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:39.949
and then we can solve for by.

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.116
Let's try one, 'cause one
is a nice, simple number.

00:03:45.175 --> 00:03:47.609
So we could write f of one,

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:51.442
which would be negative
four times one plus b.

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:56.427
And they tell us that f of
one is one, is equal to one.

00:03:56.427 --> 00:03:58.341
And so this part right over here,

00:03:58.341 --> 00:04:02.975
we could write that as negative
four plus b is equal to one,

00:04:02.975 --> 00:04:06.507
and then we could add four to
both sides of this equation,

00:04:06.507 --> 00:04:10.119
and then we get b is equal to five.

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:14.286
So we get f of x is equal
to negative 4x plus five.

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:17.253
Now, does that make sense

00:04:17.253 --> 00:04:18.807
that the y-intercept here is five?

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:19.998
Well, you see that right over here.

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:23.123
By inspection, you could
have guessed, actually,

00:04:23.123 --> 00:04:25.051
that the y-intercept here is five,

00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:26.025
but now we've solved it.

00:04:26.025 --> 00:04:28.708
Maybe this was 5.00001 or something,

00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:32.742
but now we know for sure
it's negative 4x plus five.

00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:33.636
Or another way you could've said it,

00:04:33.636 --> 00:04:35.266
if the slope is negative four,

00:04:35.266 --> 00:04:37.468
if this right over here is nine,

00:04:37.468 --> 00:04:39.913
you increase one in the x direction,

00:04:39.913 --> 00:04:41.940
you're gonna decrease
four in the y direction,

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.313
and that will get you
to y is equal to five,

00:04:44.313 --> 00:04:45.538
so that is the y-intercept.

00:04:45.538 --> 00:04:49.636
But either way, we have figured
out the linear function.

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:52.816
Now let's figure out the
exponential function.

00:04:52.816 --> 00:04:54.933
So here we could just use the two points

00:04:54.933 --> 00:04:56.884
to figure out these two unknowns.

00:04:56.884 --> 00:05:00.432
So, for example, let's
try this first point.

00:05:00.432 --> 00:05:03.746
So g of negative one, which if we look

00:05:03.746 --> 00:05:04.579
at this right over here,

00:05:04.579 --> 00:05:07.829
would be a times r to the negative one.

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.880
They tell us that g of negative one

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.708
is going to be equal to nine.

00:05:13.708 --> 00:05:16.625
G of negative one is equal to nine.

00:05:17.527 --> 00:05:21.962
And so we could write this a
times r to the negative one.

00:05:21.962 --> 00:05:26.758
That's the same thing as
a over r is equal to nine,

00:05:26.758 --> 00:05:29.379
or we could multiply both sides by r,

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.212
and we could say a is equal to 9r.

00:05:33.165 --> 00:05:35.023
Now let's use this other point.

00:05:35.023 --> 00:05:37.401
This other point, they tell us.

00:05:37.401 --> 00:05:40.212
They tell us that g of one,

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:41.159
which would be the same thing

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:45.895
as a times r to the first
power or just a times r,

00:05:45.895 --> 00:05:50.062
that that is equal to one,
or a times r is equal to one.

00:05:52.415 --> 00:05:54.797
So how can we use this
information right here,

00:05:54.797 --> 00:05:57.404
a is equal to 9r and a
times r is equal to one,

00:05:57.404 --> 00:05:59.154
to solve for a and r?

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:01.956
Well, I have a little system here.

00:06:01.956 --> 00:06:04.823
It is a non-linear system,
but it's a pretty simple one.

00:06:04.823 --> 00:06:06.521
We could just take this a

00:06:06.521 --> 00:06:09.254
and substitute it in
right over here for a,

00:06:09.254 --> 00:06:11.671
and so we would get 9r for a.

00:06:13.897 --> 00:06:16.518
This first constraint tells
us a must be equal to 9r.

00:06:16.518 --> 00:06:20.256
So 9r, instead of writing
an a here, I'll write 9r,

00:06:20.256 --> 00:06:22.256
times r is equal to one.

00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:29.232
Or we could write, let me
scroll down a little bit.

00:06:29.232 --> 00:06:32.711
We could write 9r squared is equal to one.

00:06:32.711 --> 00:06:34.777
Divide both sides by nine.

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:38.202
R squared is equal to one over nine.

00:06:38.202 --> 00:06:39.791
And now to figure out r,

00:06:39.791 --> 00:06:43.433
you might wanna take the
positive and negative square root

00:06:43.433 --> 00:06:48.104
of both sides, but they tell
us that r is greater than zero,

00:06:48.104 --> 00:06:50.883
so we can just take the
principal root of both sides

00:06:50.883 --> 00:06:54.216
and we get r is equal to 1/3.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.655
And then we could substitute this back

00:06:57.655 --> 00:07:00.721
into either one of these other
two to figure out what a is.

00:07:00.721 --> 00:07:04.610
We know that a is equal to nine times r.

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:08.777
So nine times 1/3, a is equal to three.

00:07:10.016 --> 00:07:14.594
So our exponential function
could be written as g of x

00:07:14.594 --> 00:07:18.761
is equal to a, which is
three, times r, which is 1/3,

00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:23.930
1/3 to the x power.
