00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.780
ANDREW: Hey, everybody,
you're about to see

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.230
the seventh episode of "The
Boring Show," coming up

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.150
in just a second.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.640
What do we get into in this one?

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.250
We got--

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.792
EMILY: We added the iOS version
of the barometer plugin.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.250
ANDREW: That's
right, everybody got

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.240
to see me code with pointers--
like, real pointers.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.230
EMILY: In Objective-C.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.320
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.090
EMILY: And then we published,
or almost published, our app.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:34.370
Stay tuned to see
what happened there.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.286
ANDREW: Yeah, it's
normally very smooth.

00:00:37.286 --> 00:00:38.660
EMILY: We had a
guest appearance.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.880
ANDREW: By Dash, of course.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.220
And then I almost coded
something and then

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.590
you had a better way
to do it, and so we--

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.249
EMILY: So basically,
we streamified.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:49.790
ANDREW: Yeah.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.990
EMILY: So--

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:51.830
ANDREW: We're very
reactive and asynchronous.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.910
We're just very hip that way.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:53.450
EMILY: Yeah.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.370
Made it more darty.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.110
So the barometer plugin,
you could get one reading,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.360
and then we added so
that you can subscribe

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.480
to a stream of those results.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:01.980
ANDREW: Mhm.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.354
And then we used
a stream builder

00:01:03.354 --> 00:01:05.000
to display them in a text.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.380
All right, so all
that is coming up.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590
We hope you enjoy it.
