people started reporting out-of-body

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860
people started reporting out-of-body
 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640

experiences and after they were out of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650
experiences and after they were out of
 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.530

the body if he kept spinning them it

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
the body if he kept spinning them it
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660
the body if he kept spinning them it
would turn into a near-death experience

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670
would turn into a near-death experience
 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.260
would turn into a near-death experience
right so he's the person who has air

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

experiences and near-death experiences

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780
experiences and near-death experiences
 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.090
experiences and near-death experiences
are actually on the same continuum

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
are actually on the same continuum
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.920
are actually on the same continuum
they're they're part of the same chain

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
they're they're part of the same chain
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.899
they're they're part of the same chain
of effect and a lot of it has to do with

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909
of effect and a lot of it has to do with
 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.700
of effect and a lot of it has to do with
the right temporal lobe there's other

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710
the right temporal lobe there's other
 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.760
the right temporal lobe there's other
things going on as well and there are of

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770
things going on as well and there are of
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010
things going on as well and there are of
course certain mysteries right there are

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020
course certain mysteries right there are
 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539

unsolved things and near-death

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549
unsolved things and near-death
 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.210
unsolved things and near-death
experiences we've got lots and lots and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
experiences we've got lots and lots and
 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.749
experiences we've got lots and lots and
lots of research that shows people

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759
lots of research that shows people
 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.490
lots of research that shows people
report things when they were supposedly

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
report things when they were supposedly
 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590
report things when they were supposedly
dead that they should not have known

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600
dead that they should not have known
 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780
dead that they should not have known
about at all so there are people who

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790
about at all so there are people who
 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.940
about at all so there are people who
died on operating tables right in

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
died on operating tables right in
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280
died on operating tables right in
research studies came back were brought

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290
research studies came back were brought
 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.990
research studies came back were brought
back they had near-death experiences and

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000
back they had near-death experiences and
 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.810
back they had near-death experiences and
while they were dead the nurse would

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820
while they were dead the nurse would
 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.490
while they were dead the nurse would
take their glasses off and put it in a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500
take their glasses off and put it in a
 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.889
take their glasses off and put it in a
drawer and later when everybody was

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899
drawer and later when everybody was
 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.170
drawer and later when everybody was
running around looking around for their

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
running around looking around for their
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.180
running around looking around for their

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050
the person who was on the operating
 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.750
the person who was on the operating
table the time the patient who was dead

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
table the time the patient who was dead
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.800
table the time the patient who was dead
at the time said oh yeah they're in the

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810
at the time said oh yeah they're in the
 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.270
at the time said oh yeah they're in the
bottom drawer over there and this is a

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280
bottom drawer over there and this is a
 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.530

Pimm's my mom will study that was

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:20.540
Pimm's my mom will study that was
 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.760
Pimm's my mom will study that was
actually done in the Netherlands this is

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770
actually done in the Netherlands this is
 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.320
actually done in the Netherlands this is
where that actually happened but there's

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330
where that actually happened but there's
 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.660
where that actually happened but there's
a lots and lots of experiences like that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670
a lots and lots of experiences like that
 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.720
a lots and lots of experiences like that
so somewhere along the line information

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730
so somewhere along the line information
 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.000
so somewhere along the line information
is getting through right we don't know

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010
is getting through right we don't know
 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.190
is getting through right we don't know
that yet that's still the mystery but a

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200
that yet that's still the mystery but a
 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.050
that yet that's still the mystery but a
lot of the other stuff we understand the

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060
lot of the other stuff we understand the
 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.260
lot of the other stuff we understand the
biology behind it now

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270
