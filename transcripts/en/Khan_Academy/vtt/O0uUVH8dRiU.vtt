00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.300
Let's do some example problems
dealing with functions and

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.990
their domains and ranges.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.330
Just as a review, a function
is just an operator-- let's

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.860
say this function is f; that
tends to be the most typical

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.309
letter for functions-- that
operates on some input, in

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.140
this case, the input is x, and
it produces some output y.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
Or you could view it as you take
some input x, put it into

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.740
your function box f, and it's
going to operate on it and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980
produce some y.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.390
And the set of values that x
can take on is the domain.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.320
The set of values that f can
legitimately operate on,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.390
that's the domain.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.110
And the set of values
y that f can

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.140
produce, that is the range.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.080
Now, with that in mind, let's
figure out, one, the function

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.440
definitions for each of these
problems here, these example

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.250
problems, and then figure out
the domains and the ranges.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.140
So here we have Dustin charges
$10.00 per hour-- so let me

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.870
write that down-- $10.00 per
hour for mowing lawns.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:08.900
So how much does he charge
as a function of hours?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.020
So let's say Dustin charges, so
the function, I'll call it

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.670
d for Dustin.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.460
Dustin charges as a
function of hours.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.385
It depends on hours.

00:01:17.385 --> 00:01:20.440
The input into our box
is going to be

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:21.950
hours that he worked.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.290
It's going to be equal to the
number of hours times 10.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.020
It's going to be 10 times-- I
won't write the times there.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.640
Maybe I can just write 10h.

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.490
And, of course, he can't work
negative hours, so we could

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.210
write h is going to be greater
than or equal to 0.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.890
That's our function
definition.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.740
If you say, hey, how much is he
going to charge for working

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.750
half an hour?

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.160
You put 1/2 in here, which
essentially substitutes this h

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.120
with a 1/2.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.240
You do 10 times 1/2.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.970
Let me write that down
on the side here.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.780
So Dustin's going to charge
for 1/2 hour.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.470
He's going to charge 10--
wherever you see the h,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.050
replace it with 1/2-- times 1/2,
which is equal to $5.00.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.210
That's our function
definition.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.660
I was just showing you an
example of applying it.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.023
Now, let's figure out the
domain and the range.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.480
So I almost explicitly say
it here, you can't

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.500
work negative hours.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.900
This number, this function,
is not defined if h

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.380
is less than 0.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.630
So we could say non-negative.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.580
And we could say real numbers,
which it could be everything

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.700
including pi and e
and all of that.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.320
But you can't legitimately
charge

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.760
someone 10 times pi dollars.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.760
That's not a legitimate amount
that one can charge someone in

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.440
the real world, because at the
end of the day, you have to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.050
round to the penny.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.370
You can't actually
charge them that.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.040
So any number that he
charges is going to

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.010
be a rational number.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.880
It can be expressed
as a fraction.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.680
So we can kind of take out
numbers like e and pi.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.440
So if we want to be really cute
about it, we would say

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.860
non-negative.

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.210
rational numbers.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.160
And these are just numbers that
can be expressed as a

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010
fraction, which are most
numbers, just not these

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:23.040
numbers that just keep not
repeating and all of that.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.700
So non-negative rational
numbers is what he

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.890
can input in here.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:36.060
And then the range, which is
the valid-- once again,

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.750
whatever number you put in for
h, remember, you can only put

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.350
in non-negative values for h,
non-negative rational values

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.310
for h, so whatever numbers you
put in for h, you're going to

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.530
get positive values for how much
he charges for 10h, for

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.880
the value of the function.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.090
So once again it's going to be
non-negative, and if you put a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.700
rational number here and it's
being expressed as a fraction

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.130
and you multiply it by 10,
it's still going to be a

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.380
rational number.

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.840
And if you want to be really
cute, you could say any number

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.860
that could be expressed
as a dollar sign.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.730
But anyway, I don't want to get
too cute on this problem.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.960
I think you get the idea.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.660
Let's do more

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.649
problems. All right.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:21.100
Here we have Maria doing
some tutoring.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.410
Maria charges $25.00 per hour
for tutoring math with a

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.740
minimum charge of $15.00.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.010
So Maria charges as a
function of hours.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.710
So she's going to charge
$15.00 if you don't get

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.650
enough hours in.

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.510
So at $25.00 per hour, in order
to make $15.00, you've

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.980
got to work 15/25, so
it's 3/5 of an hour.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:53.100
So if her hours are less than
3/5 and greater than or equal

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.270
to 0, she's going to
charge $15.00.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.490
Because if she only worked 1/5
of an hour, the bill would

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.150
have been $5.00, but
she says she has a

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.120
minimum charge of $15.00.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.390
So she's going to charge $15.00
up until 3/5 of an

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.110
hour, or 36 minutes.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:15.365
And then after that, for h
greater than 3/5, she's going

00:05:15.365 --> 00:05:17.400
to charge $25.00 an hour.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.310
She's going to charge
25 times h.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.990
So that's her function
definition right there.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.890
Now, what is the domain,
the domain for

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.050
Maria's billing function?

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.940
Well, once again, this
is only defined for

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.190
non-negative numbers.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.030
And by the same logic we used
here, we got a little cute.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.860
We said, oh, she really can't
charge e hours or pi hours.

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.590
That's not realistic
for her to measure.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.900
Everything's going to be
expressible as a fraction.

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.930
For example, even 5,
if you say 5 hours,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.820
that's still a fraction.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:56.790
That's 5 over 1.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.840
So let's say non-negative
rational numbers.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.260
And what's the range of her
charging function or her

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.010
billing function?

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.660
Well, it has to be
at least $15.00.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.005
No matter what, she's going to
charge $15.00, so it's going

00:06:13.005 --> 00:06:15.430
to be $15.00 or more.

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:22.920
So it's going to be rational
numbers greater

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:30.420
than or equal to $15.00.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.200
There's no situation in which
she will charge $14.00.

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.230
There's no situation
in which she would

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.960
charge negative $1.00.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.380
Everything's going to be greater
than or equal to 15.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:42.950
So now we have these more
abstract function definitions,

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:45.260
so now can stick really
any number in it.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.930
Well, we're not going
to deal with

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.010
complexes, any real number.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:49.610
But let's see if they limit
it a little bit.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:50.453
So we have f of x.

00:06:50.453 --> 00:06:56.400
Let me rewrite it. f of x is
equal to 15x minus 12.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.870
So what's the domain here?

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.420
What's our domain?

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:06.016
Well, I can stick any real
number x in here and I'm just

00:07:06.016 --> 00:07:08.230
going to multiply it by 15
and then subtract 12.

00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:09.280
I could put pi there.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.780
I could put the square
of 2 there.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.450
I could put e there.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:13.900
I could do all sorts
of crazy things.

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.935
So I'm going to say
all real numbers.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:22.880
Any real number I put in for
x, I'm going to get a

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.540
legitimate output.

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.705
And then what is my range?

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:33.730
Well, once again, this can take
on any value out there.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.410
I can get to any negative
value if I

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.990
make x negative enough.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.970
I'm going to subtract 12 from
it, but I could get to any

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:39.660
negative value.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.920
I could get to zero.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.880
I could get to any
positive value.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:49.096
So this is also going to
be all real numbers.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:52.900
Now we have this function.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:56.560
It says f of x is equal to--
they forgot the equal sign--

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.970
2x squared plus 5.

00:07:59.970 --> 00:08:03.660
So what is the domain?

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:07.020
What are all of the valid values
for x that I could

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:07.800
stick here?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:08.700
Well, I could stick
anything here.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.550
I could put e there.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.030
2 times e squared plus 5.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.810
I could put a square
root of 2 there.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:14.220
I could put a negative
number there.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.910
So I could really take
on any real number.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:26.260
All real numbers, positive or
negative or otherwise, or even

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.420
non-rational.

00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:30.590
And then what is
the range here?

00:08:30.590 --> 00:08:32.260
And this is interesting.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.520
Because no matter what number
I put here, this value right

00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:38.559
here is going to be
greater than zero.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.045
This is going to be, right
here, non-negative.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.490
Even if you put a really
negative number here, you're

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:47.040
going to square it, so it's
going to become a really

00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:48.640
positive number when
you square it.

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.460
So this expression right here
is going to be non-negative.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:55.890
So if you take a non-negative
number and you add it to 5,

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:58.120
you're always going to get
something greater than or

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.140
equal to 5.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.250
Worst case, this is a zero,
and then you get a 5.

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.690
But if this is either slightly
less than zero or slightly

00:09:04.690 --> 00:09:07.750
more than zero, you're going to
get values greater than 5.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:16.740
So the range is all real
numbers greater

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.450
than or equal to 5.

00:09:19.450 --> 00:09:21.980
Your f of x could never take
on the value zero.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.080
There's no way to get zero.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.330
Problem 5.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.900
They have f of x is
equal to 1 over x.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:38.550
So, once again, our domain.

00:09:38.550 --> 00:09:40.550
Well, we could put any
value in for x.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.960
Any real number will
work here.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.480
We're just going to take
the inverse of it.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.830
So this is going to be all
reals, all real numbers.

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.380
And then what is the range?

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.450
This is interesting as well.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:58.640
Because no matter what I put
here, I can put anything here.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.550
Oh, actually, let me be
very, very careful.

00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:03.670
This is not defined for
x is equal to 0.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:08.980
All real that are not
equal to zero.

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:11.970
If I put zero here, I'm
going to get 1/0.

00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:13.260
It will be undefined.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.020
Let me write that down.

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:18.690
I almost made a mistake.
f of 0 is undefined.

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.380
And that literally means
we don't know what

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.150
to do with the zero.

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.680
We have not defined a way
to operate on a zero.

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.400
So f of 0 is undefined.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.020
So the domain is all reals
except for zero.

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.120
And now what's the range?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:37.210
Well, once again, we can take on
any value here except zero.

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:38.465
We could try to approach zero.

00:10:38.465 --> 00:10:41.220
If x got really, really, really,
really, really large,

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.500
then this will approach zero.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.890
If x got really, really
negative, it'll approach zero.

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.130
But in no circumstance will we
actually ever get to zero.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:58.210
So once again, all reals that
are not equal to zero.

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:01.830
All real numbers except
for zero.

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:02.370
All right.

00:11:02.370 --> 00:11:03.080
Problem 6.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.300
What is the range of the
function y is equal to x

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:10.100
squared minus 5 when the
domain is-- so they're

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.300
defining the domain.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.110
They're restricting it.

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.470
They're saying the domain is
just the numbers minus 2,

00:11:16.470 --> 00:11:20.410
minus 1, 0, 1, and 2.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.640
So this function definition
really should say f of x is

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:32.660
equal to x squared minus 5 for x
is equal to-- we could write

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:39.180
any member for x is a member
of the set minus 2,

00:11:39.180 --> 00:11:43.070
minus 1, 0, 1, 2.

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:45.420
It's not defined for x being
anything else to that.

00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:46.860
You don't know what
to do with it.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.600
You can only apply it if
x is one of these.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:50.590
So what's the range?

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.035
Well, the range is all of the
functions, all the values that

00:11:54.035 --> 00:11:56.200
f of x can take on.

00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:03.960
So the range is going to be the
set of values that we get

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.900
when we put in all of
these different x's.

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.280
So let's try this first
one: negative 2.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.040
Negative 2 squared minus 5.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.830
That's 4 minus 5.

00:12:13.830 --> 00:12:15.615
That's negative 1.

00:12:15.615 --> 00:12:17.220
Let's do negative 1.

00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:19.910
Negative 1 squared minus 5.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.000
That is 1 minus 5.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.050
That is negative 4.

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:25.140
You have 0.

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:26.450
0 squared.

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.750
So f of 0, you have 0 squared
minus 5, that's negative 5.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.560
And you have 1.

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.940
1 squared minus 5, that's
negative 4, so it's

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.180
already in our range.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.630
Then you have 2.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:41.110
2 squared minus 5, that's
negative 1,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:42.020
already in our range.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:46.190
So that's all of the values that
this function can take

00:12:46.190 --> 00:12:47.670
on, given that we've
restricted it

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.380
to only these inputs.
