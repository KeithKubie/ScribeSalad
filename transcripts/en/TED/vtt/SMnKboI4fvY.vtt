00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.976
I really love color.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.080
I notice it everywhere and in everything.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.496
My family makes fun of me

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.016
because I like to use colors
with elusive-sounding names,

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.176
like celadon ...

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.536
(Laughter)

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.760
ecru ...

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.280
carmine.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.056
Now, if you haven't noticed,
I am black, thank you --

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.096
(Laughter)

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.576
and when you grow up
in a segregated city as I have,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.816
like Chicago,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.480
you're conditioned to believe
that color and race can never be separate.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.736
There's hardly a day that goes by

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.480
that somebody is not
reminding you of your color.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.960
Racism is my city's vivid hue.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:09.096
Now, we can all agree that race
is a socially constructed phenomenon,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.496
but it's often hard to see it
in our everyday existence.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.496
Its pervasiveness is everywhere.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.416
The neighborhoods I grew up in

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.416
were filled with a kind of
culturally coded beauty.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.136
Major commercial corridors were lined
with brightly painted storefronts

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.736
that competed for black consumer dollars.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.216
The visual mash-ups of corner stores
and beauty supply houses,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.056
currency exchanges,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.176
are where I actually, inadvertently
learned the foundational principles

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.200
of something I would later
come to know is called color theory.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.216
I can remember being pretty intimidated
by this term in college --

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.816
color theory.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.696
All these stuffy old white guys
with their treatises

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.256
and obscure terminologies.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.480
I'd mastered each one of their
color palettes and associated principles.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.656
Color theory essentially boils down
to the art and science

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.416
of using color to form
compositions and spaces.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.640
It's not so complicated.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.600
This was my bible in college.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.736
Josef Albers posited a theory
about the color red,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.336
and it always has stuck with me.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.536
He argues that the iconic
color of a cola can is red,

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.416
and that in fact
all of us can agree that it's red

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.936
but the kinds of reds that we imagine

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.440
are as varied as the number
of people in this room.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.896
So imagine that.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.896
This color that we've all been
taught since kindergarten is primary --

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.496
red, yellow, blue --

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.896
in fact is not primary,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.696
is not irreducible,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.680
is not objective but quite subjective.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.696
What?

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.336
(Laughter)

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.880
Albers called this "relational."

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.800
Relational.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.896
And so it was the first time

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.200
that I was able to see my own neighborhood
as a relational context.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.200
Each color is affected by its neighbor.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.480
Each other is affected by its neighbor.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.376
In the 1930s,

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.416
the United States government created

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.656
the Federal Housing Administration,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.960
which in turn created a series of maps

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.976
which were using a color-coding system
to determine which neighborhoods

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.680
should and should not receive
federal housing loans.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.776
Their residential security map
was its own kind of color palette,

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.376
and in fact was more influential
than all of those color palettes

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.520
that I had been studying
in college combined.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.456
Banks would not lend to people
who lived in neighborhoods like mine.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.200
That's me in D86.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.696
Their cartographers
were literally coloring in these maps

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.320
and labeling that color "hazardous."

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.096
Red was the new black,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.519
and black neighborhoods were colored.

00:04:31.959 --> 00:04:33.416
The problem persists today,

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.160
and we've seen it most recently
in the foreclosure crisis.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.896
In Chicago, this is best
symbolized by these Xs

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.936
that are emblazoned
on the fronts of vacated houses

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.520
on the South and West Side.

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.576
The reality is that someone else's
color palettes were determining

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.440
my physical and artistic existence.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.160
Ridiculous.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.216
I decided that I'd create
my own color palette

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.856
and speak to the people
who live where I do

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.000
and alter the way
that color had been defined for us.

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.096
It was a palette that I didn't
have to search far for

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.536
and look for in a treatise,

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.840
because I already knew it.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.000
What kind of painter
emerges from this reality?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.080
What color is urban?

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:30.440
What color is ghetto?

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.600
What color is privilege?

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.920
What color is gang-related?

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.040
What color is gentrification?

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.480
What color is Freddie Gray?

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.800
What color is Mike Brown?

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.856
Finally, I'd found a way

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.976
to connect my racialized
understanding of color

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.120
with my theoretical
understanding of color.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.056
And I gave birth to my third baby:

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.616
"Color(ed) Theory."

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.400
(Laughter)

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.216
"Color(ed) Theory"
was a two-year artistic project

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.016
in which I applied my own color palette
to my own neighborhoods

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.560
in my own way.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.136
Now, if I walked down
79th Street right now

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:28.760
and I asked 50 people for the name
of the slightly greener shade of cyan,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.936
they would look at me sideways.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.976
(Laughter)

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.176
But if I say, "What color
is Ultra Sheen?" --

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.136
oh, a smile emerges,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.280
stories about their
grandmother's bathroom ensue.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.696
I mean, who needs turquoise
when you have Ultra Sheen?

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.296
Who needs teal when you have Ultra Sheen?

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:53.296
Who needs ultramarine when you have ...

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.376
(Audience) Ultra Sheen.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.056
(Laughter)

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.840
This is exactly how I derived my palette.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.896
I would ask friends and family

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.576
and people with backgrounds
that were similar to mine

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.536
for those stories and memories.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.776
The stories weren't always happy

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.400
but the colors always resonated
more than the product itself.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.520
I took those theories to the street.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.416
"Ultra Sheen."

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.480
"Pink Oil Moisturizer."

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.056
If you're from Chicago,
"Harold's Chicken Shack."

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.616
(Laughter)

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:33.720
"Currency Exchange + Safe Passage."

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.280
"Flamin' Red Hots."

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.280
"Loose Squares" ...

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.440
and "Crown Royal Bag."

00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.216
I painted soon-to-be-demolished homes

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.200
in a much-maligned area called Englewood.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.296
We'd gather up as much paint
as I could fit in my trunk,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.776
I'd call my most trusted art homies,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.776
my amazing husband always by my side,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.120
and we'd paint every inch of the exteriors
in monochromatic fashion.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.256
I wanted to understand scale
in a way that I hadn't before.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.056
I wanted to apply the colors
to the biggest canvas I could imagine ...

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.416
houses.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.456
So I'd obsessively drive up and down
familiar streets that I'd grown up on,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.176
I'd cross-reference these houses
with the city's data portal

00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.896
to make sure that they'd been
tagged for demolition --

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.400
unsalvageable, left for dead.

00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.216
I really wanted to understand
what it meant to just let color rule,

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.936
to trust my instincts,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.976
to stop asking for permission.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.416
No meetings with city officials,

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.416
no community buy-in,

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.496
just let color rule

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.799
in my desire to paint
different pictures about the South Side.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:08.240
These houses sit in stark contrast
to their fully lined counterparts.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:15.976
We'd paint to make them stand out
like Monopoly pieces

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.280
in these environments.

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:21.096
And we'd go on these early Sunday mornings

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:25.920
and keep going until we ran out
of that paint or until someone complained.

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.600
"Hey, did you paint that?"

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:37.240
a driver asked as I was taking
this image one day.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.416
Me, nervously:

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.640
"Yes?"

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.776
His face changed.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.536
"Aw, I thought Prince was coming."

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.696
(Laughter)

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:50.656
He had grown up on this block,

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:52.736
and so you could imagine
when he drove past

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:57.656
and saw one of its last remaining houses
mysteriously change colors overnight,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.736
it was clearly not
a Crown Royal bag involved,

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:03.376
it was a secret beacon from Prince.

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.240
(Laughter)

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:12.096
And though that block
was almost all but erased,

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:18.096
it was the idea that Prince
could pop up in unexpected places

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:22.296
and give free concerts in areas
that the music industry and society

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.040
had deemed were not valuable anymore.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.560
For him,

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:33.576
the idea that just the image of this house

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.776
was enough to bring Prince there

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:38.736
meant that it was possible.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.496
In that moment,

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.680
that little patch of Eggleston
had become synonymous with royalty.

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.456
And for however briefly,

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.320
Eric Bennett's neighborhood
had regained its value.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.736
So we traded stories
despite being strangers

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.256
about which high school we'd gone to

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.016
and where we'd grown up,

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.456
and Mrs. So-and-so's candy store --

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.536
of being kids on the South Side.

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.816
And once I revealed

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:09.016
that in fact this project had
absolutely nothing to do with Prince,

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:11.216
Eric nodded in seeming agreement,

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:14.136
and as we parted ways and he drove off,

00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.896
he said, "But he could still come!"

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.056
(Laughter)

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:23.656
He had assumed
full ownership of this project

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.496
and was not willing to relinquish it,

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.440
even to me, its author.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.240
That, for me, was success.

00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:37.816
I wish I could tell you that this project
transformed the neighborhood

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.736
and all the indices
that we like to rely on:

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.016
increased jobs,
reduced crime, no alcoholism --

00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.320
but in fact it's more gray than that.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:52.216
"Color(ed) Theory"
catalyzed new conversations

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.080
about the value of blackness.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.336
"Color(ed) Theory" made unmistakably
visible the uncomfortable questions

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.296
that institutions and governments
have to ask themselves

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.280
about why they do what they do.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:13.896
They ask equally difficult questions
of myself and my neighborhood counterparts

00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.096
about our value systems

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.040
and what our path
to collective agency needs to be.

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.816
Color gave me freedom in a way
that didn't wait for permission

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.360
or affirmation or inclusion.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.520
Color was something that I could rule now.

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.456
One of the neighborhood members
and paint crew members said it best

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.416
when he said, "This didn't
change the neighborhood,

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:45.136
it changed people's perceptions about
what's possible for their neighborhood,"

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.400
in big and small ways.

00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.176
Passersby would ask me,
"Why are you painting that house

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.136
when you know the city's just going
to come and tear it down?"

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.576
At the time, I had no idea,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.376
I just knew that I had to do something.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:03.656
I would give anything to better
understand color as both a medium

00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:07.840
and as an inescapable way
that I am identified in society.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.176
If I have any hope
of making the world better,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.216
I have to love and leverage
both of these ways that I'm understood,

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.320
and therein lies the value and the hue.

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.336
Thank you.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.200
(Applause and cheers)
