[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.467 --> 00:00:07.300
RON CARUCCI: So thanks
for being here today.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.890
I hope this is a meaningful
conversation for you.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.540
How many of you,
by a show of hands,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.027
have aspirations of
some kind to elevate

00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:14.610
your role at some
point in your career

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.079
and lead more people than
you're leading today?

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:16.579
Great.

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.530
So this will be super
relevant to you, I hope,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:24.610
to avoid some of the pitfalls
we found in our research.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:26.751
So I want to do three things--

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:29.250
talk about the data we collected
and how we got the research

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.750
and why, how it is that people
who rise up to bigger jobs

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.230
and organizations, some
seem to thrive, and then

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.820
talk with you in a
little bit of Q&amp;A

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.940
about how it is you are
thinking about applying it here.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.560
So a bunch of years ago--

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.850
our firm works on large, crazy,
transformational projects

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.060
with our clients.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.435
And a bunch of
years ago, we were

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:54.420
working with an organization
during which one

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.586
of the young leaders who
had been part of the effort

00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.030
was super-high-potential,
seen as very competent,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.200
people enjoy working with him.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.814
Everybody saw a long,
promising career for him.

00:01:05.814 --> 00:01:07.980
At the end of the project,
he was offered the chance

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.615
to take on a much
broader assignment

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:12.240
for the organization in this new
world we had just transformed.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.115
Nobody was surprised.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:14.980
Everybody assumed,
oh, he'll do great.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.460
About nine months later, I
saw his name on the caller ID,

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.280
and I was excited.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.040
I assumed, oh, he's
calling to tell me

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.290
about all the great
progress they've made

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.110
and how things are going.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.690
But sadly, he was calling
to tell me he'd been fired

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.730
and that he needed help
getting another job.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.550
I barely had time to recover
from that conversation, two

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.970
hours later the CEO of
this large multinational

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.210
gazillion-dollar organization,
who's our client, called

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.250
to also let me know
they'd let him go,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.670
and that he was a bit angry,
implying-- more than implying--

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.800
that some of the
responsibility for his failure

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.820
was mine, for not
better preparing him.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.090
That didn't feel good.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.880
I was devastated.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.130
I couldn't imagine, how could
we have possibly misjudged

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.480
his potential that much?

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.090
Every nine-box, eight-box,
six-box, whatever grid

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.780
you used, he was off the charts.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.470
How could somebody suddenly
go from being in one level,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.730
being the next coming,
to suddenly being

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.270
a disaster in nine months?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.290
That made no sense.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.450
I asked if we might come
back into the organization

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.820
to see if we could learn
what could have gone wrong.

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.400
That short investigation
we went back in and did

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.950
led us to a 10-year
longitudinal study

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.070
of more than 2,700 leaders.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:33.380
And what we found out was,
painfully, that more than 50%

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.600
of those that take on
broader assignments

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.290
in their organizations fail
in their first 18 months.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.690
That young leader was
just another statistic.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.700
We thought, gosh,
we can do better!

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:49.830
I don't ever want another phone
call like that in my career

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.380
again.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.930
So we began digging and
digging and digging to find,

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.736
why is it-- for
more than 20 years,

00:02:58.736 --> 00:02:59.860
we've known this statistic.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.401
This is not-- the
recruiters love it,

00:03:01.401 --> 00:03:02.870
because it's an
annuity for them.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.280
But short of that,
why is that OK?

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.027
50%, right?

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:09.860
That's a crap shoot.

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.560
Why is it OK that the carnage
of families that have relocated

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.060
and people who had promising
ideas and opportunities

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.250
that organizations were
hoping to capitalize,

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.360
that half of them go
sideways is reasonable?

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
That just seemed completely
unacceptable to us.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.630
So we began to go digging.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.000
And the scary thing we
found in the research

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:40.020
was, when we found out how many
landmines organizations put

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.210
in the way of people
on their way up,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.820
it's a wonder any
of them succeed.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.880
I couldn't wait to find out
what the other 50% were doing

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.064
to manage to traverse those.

00:03:50.064 --> 00:03:51.480
I went back to the
CEO and I said,

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.180
I will apologize and
take responsibility

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.050
for all the landmines I did
not prepare him to face.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.530
You need to take responsibility
for putting them there,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.760
because they're so unnecessary.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.930
So what I want to spend
time today talking about

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.100
that we found in this study of
2,700 leaders, 1,800 of which

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.570
were set aside as at least
bordering on exemplary,

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.110
we also isolated 100
of them in mid-ascent

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.560
to see if we could sort of watch
in slow-mo what was happening

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.990
across this elevation season.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.200
Whether it was to an executive
role or to middle management,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.650
from wherever they were, what
was going on on the way up,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.650
and what caused some to
stick the landing, and some

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.420
to faceplant?

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.820
To hopefully avoid those.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.130
So there's three parts
I want to chat about.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.630
One is, what's the weird things
that happen on the way up?

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.520
Why is there this
altitude sickness?

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.020
Right, you get to
a higher altitude,

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.630
you can barely breathe
as you land there.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.460
And then the great
news in the data

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.300
was, in fact, that
as we dug into,

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:05.700
what were the other half doing
that made them just thrive?

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.820
And it turns out there were
four recurring patterns.

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.600
I had the research team
do 99 regression analyses.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.610
And they finally said, enough.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.170
It's not going to change.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.800
The same four recurring
patterns, over and over, that

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.104
set apart those that succeeded.

00:05:23.104 --> 00:05:24.520
The problem was--
and that's where

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.145
we'll spend the most
of our time today.

00:05:26.145 --> 00:05:29.070
The problem was, the data said
you had to do all four well.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.680
So people who did three
of the four brilliantly

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.070
were in the failure group.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.195
So the reason I kept going
back to do more analysis

00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:37.695
is I didn't want to have to say
you had to do all four well.

00:05:37.695 --> 00:05:40.214
I wanted to say three of the
four is OK, but it's not.

00:05:40.214 --> 00:05:41.880
So we'll talk about
what those four are.

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.790
The great news was,
these weren't four--

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.480
like, some weird
genetic misalignments

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.480
that caused this superhuman
power in these folks.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.550
These were basic
capabilities that they

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.170
had acquired and learned.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.390
So the good news is
they're learnable.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.097
The best time to
learn them is not

00:05:59.097 --> 00:06:01.680
when you hit your first senior
director job or your first vice

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.310
president job.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.760
The best time to
learn them is now.

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.450
So here's just
some of the things

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:10.660
we found that were a
little bit shocking to us.

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.520
69% of the people
in our research

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.360
said, we were not
prepared for the roles.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.070
I'm sure, in your department,
that wouldn't be the case.

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.590
But in other companies,
that's what people told us.

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.640
76% said that all of
the formal development

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.100
efforts they had undergone
did not prepare them

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.750
for the challenges they faced.

00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.250
They had great
theories and models

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:35.708
and read some
interesting articles,

00:06:35.708 --> 00:06:38.810
but what they faced
in the challenges

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.710
was never covered in any of
their learning developments.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.620
And most of them
had no coaching.

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.190
Most of them had no preparation
work before, and none of them--

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:56.740
it was in the 80% of
what they had afterwards.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.650
67% of them struggled to let go.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.300
So they took-- as
they escalated,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:02.508
they took the work with them.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.370
One of the interesting things
about the notion of power,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:12.290
we studied, how do people
handle the notion of power?

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.370
And these days, that's a
pretty important conversation.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.860
60% of them felt like impostors.

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.020
They felt like people
ascribed more power to them

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.150
than they actually felt
they had themselves.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.770
And so they struggled
to reconcile

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.790
feeling like they're going to,
at some point, find me out.

00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:31.640
So you can see here, these
are not pretty stats, right?

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.380
This begins to give
a picture for why

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.330
it is that so many promising
young professional aspiring

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:41.910
leaders are arriving in
positions that they're not

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:43.050
ready for.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:44.320
We can do better.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.260
We absolutely can do better.

00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:51.420
So one of the metaphors we use
in the early part of the book

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.490
is this is very much
like wing-walking.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.370
Long before you
were born, people

00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:59.786
in the early part of the 20th
century would actually get up--

00:07:59.786 --> 00:08:01.410
both for aerial
entertainment, but also

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.170
to learn how to refuel planes--
would walk across the wing.

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:06.630
And of course, the rule
number one in wing-walking

00:08:06.630 --> 00:08:09.250
is never let go of
the strut you're

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:11.190
holding onto until
you have a firm

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.860
grip on the strut
you're going to,

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.150
because that doesn't go well.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:21.931
Well, too many wing-walkers
either let go too soon,

00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:22.930
or they couldn't let go.

00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:24.610
They became paralyzed.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.920
And they could never
cross the wing.

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.700
But both types of failures
happen on the way up.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.970
Leaders get too
confident and too cocky,

00:08:33.970 --> 00:08:37.390
and they just fly up there
without taking lessons

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:40.150
with them, or they freeze,
and they get paralyzed

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.830
in the terror of a
different orientation

00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:45.900
and a different
view of the world.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.170
So here are some of the--

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:52.519
five of the numbers of things
we found on the way up.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.560
How many of you have been
involved here at Google

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.761
in interviewing
people for other jobs?

00:08:56.761 --> 00:08:59.260
Now, I know a little something
about your selection process.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.610
You actually do a decent
job of asking people

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.529
for evidence-based
behavioral events

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:05.570
of their accomplishments.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:12.600
But many organizations still
interview people using what?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.010
Their resume.

00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:16.320
And what is it they
do with the resume?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.109
This is the part where you talk.

00:09:19.109 --> 00:09:19.900
They go through it.

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.340
Right.

00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:25.630
And then you hear eerie
statements like this.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:28.960
Wow, look at those great apps
you built at your company!

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:30.640
That's what we need!

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.489
Or, my gosh, look at this
incredible sophisticated coding

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.530
and engineering work you've
done at your company.

00:09:35.530 --> 00:09:36.910
That's what we need!

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:39.640
Or, wow, look at
these great brands

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.750
you were part of building.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.940
That's what we need!

00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:45.520
What's happening
in that statement?

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.820
You're setting
somebody up to fail,

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.570
because here's the
message you're sending.

00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.540
You're saying to them,
you have a formula.

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:54.940
You have a recipe
for success that we

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.010
would like you to bring here.

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:00.070
How many of you have watched
people enter the organization--

00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:03.250
maybe not here at Google,
but maybe other companies--

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:06.100
and have it not go well?

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.980
And what's the term we use
after about six or seven months?

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:12.190
They're not a good fit.

00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.810
Right?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.990
Which is code for all kinds
of things, usually not

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:18.550
the issue of a fit.

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:20.010
It's a failure of context.

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:22.740
Right, this person failed
to read the tea leaves.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:26.310
They come in with this mythical
mandate to prove themselves.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:28.260
You told me this
is what you wanted.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:28.800
Right?

00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.500
So they take the bait,
and they come in,

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:34.050
whether they've risen up and
got hired by somebody inside,

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.930
or came in from the outside,
they have a mandate.

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.840
So they took it seriously.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.670
Well, the mandate is
devoid of context, right?

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.950
I don't want your
success formula slapped

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.900
on my organization.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:47.760
I'm assuming there
is some wisdom you

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.340
can bring with you
from those experiences

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.350
that you can contextualize here.

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:59.000
But if you fail to learn me
before you try and change me,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.780
that's not going to go well.

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.950
So from the very beginning,
many of these leaders

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.230
with promising talent
and otherwise important

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.110
contributions failed because
they had this mandate

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:11.030
that they believed
they had to follow,

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:13.700
that they should
have never followed.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.320
Well, so let's play this out.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.740
So what happens when
I'm trying to slap

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:21.350
on this formula of success
you told me you wanted,

00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:22.925
and it's not working?

00:11:22.925 --> 00:11:24.800
What have you seen happen
to the person who's

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.360
not being able to get traction?

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.340
What do you see in them?

00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.570
They get frustrated.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:31.909
And why are they frustrated?

00:11:36.727 --> 00:11:37.810
They're not making impact.

00:11:37.810 --> 00:11:39.960
And they were told
to make impact.

00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.270
So my first conclusion about
why I'm not making impact

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:47.080
is usually not, it must be me.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.770
Right?

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:49.466
It's usually you didn't--

00:11:49.466 --> 00:11:50.590
I go to the hiring manager.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.390
You didn't tell me
it was this bad.

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:55.850
Or, you didn't tell me
they were this resistant.

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:59.110
And so now my diagnosis
of what's not working

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.540
becomes an indictment
and a judgment

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.040
of why they can't get this
brilliant thing that I brought.

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:08.960
Right?

00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.590
What happens when those
around this person

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.900
feel indicted by their presence?

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.060
And usually it sounds like this.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.880
Well, at Apple, we--

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.480
or, well, at Microsoft,
what we did was--

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.430
and what are people
saying in the hallway?

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:29.510
If I hear one more story
about where they came from--

00:12:29.510 --> 00:12:30.010
right?

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:33.540
So now, the minute
they start talking,

00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:34.660
when I was-- that's it.

00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.500
I've tuned out.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.629
What comes next
could be brilliant.

00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:41.170
It could be an amazing solution
to the problem we're solving.

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:43.810
I am not going to hear it,
because I don't give a crap

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:45.599
about where you learned it.

00:12:45.599 --> 00:12:47.890
And what you're telling me,
whether you mean to or not,

00:12:47.890 --> 00:12:51.021
is you don't give a crap about
where you're applying it.

00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:51.520
Right?

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.894
So now, this could have all
happened in three months, six

00:12:53.894 --> 00:12:54.860
months, whatever.

00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.820
But look, the death
spiral's already begun.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.150
And I have had no impact.

00:13:00.150 --> 00:13:02.760
Totally unnecessary.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.030
You still could have great
things to offer that we need.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:09.220
And that's the one
thing we're missing.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.280
So then, if I've
risen up, or I now

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.950
don't trust you to
handle my brilliance,

00:13:14.950 --> 00:13:16.700
I'm going to start
to exert control.

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.490
So if I'm in a
managerial position,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:21.190
and I fear I'm not having impact
and I'm being judged for it,

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:22.390
I'm going to exert control.

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.700
So my ability to let go
of decisions, my ability

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:27.280
to let go of
information, my ability

00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:30.760
to let go of influence that
those I lead should have,

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.450
is now impaired, because
I fear if I let it go,

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.350
I'll be set up to fail.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:38.500
What I'm not seeing is, you've
already begun to back away.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.590
We all see that
back away, that sort

00:13:41.590 --> 00:13:44.320
of virtual or physical
withdrawal of, OK, we

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.850
know where this is going to go.

00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:49.240
I don't want to be anywhere
near it when it happens.

00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:50.650
Maybe you've had
that experience.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:52.066
Maybe you've been
on the receiving

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:57.850
end of being backed away from,
as a leader or a colleague,

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.570
from those who've decided
you're not a good fit.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:05.500
So my ability to compress the
organization by making people

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:10.390
feel micromanaged,
distrusted, judged by me,

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:13.720
is now going to cause
frustration in the team

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.930
or the group or the colleagues,
among my colleagues.

00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.972
They're going to
feel disempowered.

00:14:17.972 --> 00:14:19.430
They're going to
feel-- they're not

00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.410
going to want to come to work.

00:14:20.410 --> 00:14:21.970
When they get the
engagement survey,

00:14:21.970 --> 00:14:23.590
I'm going to get dinged.

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:25.420
So even if I make
it for a full year,

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.430
I'm probably going to
get some feedback that

00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:30.490
says, either there's early signs
that this is not working out,

00:14:30.490 --> 00:14:34.910
or we're already past
it's not working out.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.860
The other thing that happens
on the way up is that people--

00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:43.060
the higher up in an organization
you go, the more longer-term

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:45.310
the result and impact you're
meant to have are, right?

00:14:45.310 --> 00:14:47.890
So there's a little bit more
ambiguity and uncertainty

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:50.094
about what impact is defined as.

00:14:50.094 --> 00:14:52.510
For somebody who's an individual
contributor or maybe even

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.700
a first-line manager,
impact can look

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:58.090
like the next few weeks or
months, or maybe, in your case,

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:00.070
probably hours.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.690
But for somebody who, as you
move up, you're thinking,

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.872
hopefully, three, six,
nine, 12 months out,

00:15:04.872 --> 00:15:07.330
which means there's a little
bit more uncertainty about how

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.340
those outcomes
will get achieved,

00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.010
and the pathway to those
outcomes is not quite defined.

00:15:12.010 --> 00:15:14.700
For some people, their need
for immediate gratification,

00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:17.140
their need for immediate
impact, is such

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.480
that they can't tolerate that.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.930
And so they struggle
with the uncertainty of,

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:25.840
how am I adding value if I can't
have an immediate line of sight

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.070
to that impact?

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:28.990
Because now my impact
is through you.

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:31.150
It's no longer at my own hands.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:32.320
It's usually through others.

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:34.611
And for some people, that's
just a very difficult thing

00:15:34.611 --> 00:15:35.590
to tolerate.

00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:38.227
It's an orientation you
have to shift, to say,

00:15:38.227 --> 00:15:40.060
I'm no longer the
smartest kid in the class.

00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:43.180
My job is now to make other kids
the smartest kid in the class.

00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:46.900
And if I've been rewarded
for a certain outcome

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.330
or a certain skill or
a certain deliverable

00:15:49.330 --> 00:15:51.280
or a certain kind of
work for a long time,

00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:53.290
and that's what I
pride myself on,

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:56.290
and now I have to
relinquish that in exchange

00:15:56.290 --> 00:16:00.210
for other people doing that
and me enabling them to do it,

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.720
that's a--

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.190
what if it doesn't work?

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.410
Or what if people don't
recognize me for the ability

00:16:05.410 --> 00:16:06.160
to have done that?

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:08.920
Or what if my impact
will be less visible now?

00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.330
What if I can't tolerate that?

00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:12.010
The good news is, if you
learn to tolerate it,

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:13.500
you're actually seen
as being a great leader

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.480
that everybody
wants to work for,

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.880
because people leave your
team and say, I learned a lot.

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:17.620
I grew a lot.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.420
I made a great contribution.

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:24.080
And the last one we found
is a little bit more--

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.461
some of these are more prone,
or look a little different

00:16:26.461 --> 00:16:27.710
when you come in from outside.

00:16:27.710 --> 00:16:29.751
But when you come in from
up in the organization,

00:16:29.751 --> 00:16:32.970
the problem is, my
guess is that if we

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:36.805
went back to hardware
and YouTube and support

00:16:36.805 --> 00:16:38.180
and assistance,
all the divisions

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:40.220
you mentioned, and I
asked you to describe some

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:43.417
of the cultural realities
of your organizations,

00:16:43.417 --> 00:16:45.750
I might hear some common
threads about Google's culture.

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:47.390
I might hear some differences.

00:16:47.390 --> 00:16:50.450
But Google has a very
strong environment,

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:52.700
and there are things
you know about Google.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:54.980
Well, the problem
is, your belief

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:57.110
that you know those
things causes you never

00:16:57.110 --> 00:16:58.730
to test those assumptions.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.670
So as you rise up, or as you
change groups and departments,

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.310
you bring what I
know with me, and you

00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:06.990
see the world
through those biases,

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:08.365
without ever
understanding, well,

00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:10.220
is that really how
it is in this group,

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:11.990
or how it is in
this team, or how it

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:13.730
is in this part of the world?

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:17.672
And so it's very important to
always test the assumptions

00:17:17.672 --> 00:17:19.130
you have about what
you believe you

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.040
know, about where
you're arriving at,

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:25.050
because they know
things about you

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.910
as well that may
or may not be true.

00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:31.380
And just as we don't want
to be labeled or concocted

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.570
in some way, neither do
the environments you have.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.430
So how do you let
go of what you know

00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:37.050
long enough to see
if all you know

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.380
is really all there is to know?

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:43.120
So those are just some
of-- there were probably--

00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.750
there's certainly a bunch more.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.720
So you can see, right,
any one of these

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.970
could take an otherwise
promising, gifted,

00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:54.200
talented person and
send them off course.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.110
All of them, avoidable.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:58.812
With just the right
kind of preparation,

00:17:58.812 --> 00:18:00.770
the right kind of
communication, the right kind

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:05.090
of conversations, nobody has
to step in these landmines.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.640
But every day in
organizations, we're

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:11.420
throwing these things in the
way, and people are doing them.

00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.600
But if you're lucky enough
to get to that place

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.494
and you arrive at
a new altitude,

00:18:17.494 --> 00:18:18.410
then there are these--

00:18:18.410 --> 00:18:20.284
you feel like you've
arrived on a new planet.

00:18:20.284 --> 00:18:22.850
There's this disorienting
aspect of a higher altitude.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.320
And these were
four of the things

00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:30.655
we discovered that leaders
struggled to be OK with.

00:18:30.655 --> 00:18:33.030
One of the problems is, when
you're leading other people,

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.730
especially if the people
you are leading are remote,

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:39.330
is there's now multiple
versions of you.

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:41.460
So you get this--
almost like your life

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:43.694
is now playing out
on the jumbotron.

00:18:43.694 --> 00:18:45.360
And people are watching
you, and they're

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.190
making up versions of you.

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.510
I have leaders say to me all
the time, I hear all the time,

00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:52.764
John said.

00:18:52.764 --> 00:18:53.430
I never said it.

00:18:58.457 --> 00:19:00.790
You have to assume that when
you become more influential

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:02.580
in an organization,
just assume there's

00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:05.280
a megaphone strapped
to your mouth 24/7.

00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.870
And everything you say
and do is amplified.

00:19:07.870 --> 00:19:10.260
You can't raise your
eyebrow without somebody

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.520
attaching meaning to it.

00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.410
Oh, she's in a bad mood today.

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:16.730
Or uh-oh, she just
came out of a meeting.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:17.640
It didn't go well.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:20.279
Or he's really frustrated
with something.

00:19:20.279 --> 00:19:22.320
Could be nothing could be
further from the truth.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.420
But we attach meaning
to our leaders--

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.850
their behavior, their
choices, their words,

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:30.850
how they act in meetings, all
has meaning, whether it's true

00:19:30.850 --> 00:19:31.850
or not.

00:19:31.850 --> 00:19:33.820
But we act upon it
as if it is true.

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:35.680
Leaders struggle
to know, what do I

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.110
do when people are making
things up about me,

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:41.797
or concocting versions
of me, that don't exist?

00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:44.130
And there are ways to manage
that, but for many leaders,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.450
it's paralyzing.

00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.870
The third one was the
access to information.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:56.270
So suddenly, people
who were my peers

00:19:56.270 --> 00:19:58.664
are now my direct reports.

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:00.830
Suddenly the way I get
information, or access to it,

00:20:00.830 --> 00:20:02.200
is a little different.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.400
It feels a little filtered.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.340
It feels a little
more sanitized.

00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.170
It's not quite as honest.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:11.780
And so how I get
people to tell me

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.080
the truth now becomes harder
and harder the higher I go,

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.330
because people don't want
to upset their bosses.

00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.076
And so dealing with a little
bit of a sifted data set

00:20:21.076 --> 00:20:23.450
becomes difficult when you're
trying to make hard choices

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:26.900
or make hard trade-offs
or allocate resources.

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.189
How we do that
becomes harder when

00:20:29.189 --> 00:20:31.230
I don't know if the
information I'm being given--

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.188
did my mic just go off?

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:34.770
OK.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:35.440
Should I wait?

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.410
Oh, there it is.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:39.300
When I don't know that
I can rely on the data

00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:40.850
that I'm getting.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.800
And so how do I make
it safe, to make

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.216
sure the people that I work
with are telling me the truth?

00:20:45.216 --> 00:20:48.060
How do I make it safe for
people to raise tough issues?

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.200
You are the company
case study for how

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.070
to create psychological
safety among teams.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.410
So my guess is that if I
went around and polled you

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:59.690
on how psychologically
safe is your team, just

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:00.920
because the case study
was written about you

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.990
doesn't mean it's happening
everywhere at your company,

00:21:02.990 --> 00:21:03.490
right?

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.600
So it's still a
difficult thing to do.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.770
For leaders, when they
then have to wonder,

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:11.570
why aren't they
telling me the truth,

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.740
and what is the information
that I'm not getting,

00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.150
and how am I getting access to
feedback, can be terrifying.

00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:22.460
For some leaders,
that loss of control,

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:27.380
that sense of influence loss,
can be completely debilitating.

00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:31.550
And lastly, the entire network
of relationships that shifts

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:33.140
can be very unsettling
for leaders.

00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:36.590
So people who were your
peers are now direct reports.

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:38.970
People who were bosses
are now your peers.

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:42.410
People who were
direct reports before

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:45.120
don't interact with you at all.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.379
And so what are the rules now?

00:21:47.379 --> 00:21:48.420
What am I allowed to say?

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:49.628
What am I not allowed to say?

00:21:49.628 --> 00:21:53.810
When you come to me saying, so,
you want to go out for beers?

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:55.490
And I'm like, well--

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:57.980
and then you get the whole,
oh, you're a boss now.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:58.610
Right.

00:21:58.610 --> 00:22:00.130
OK, never mind.

00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:02.960
You get this very
passive-aggressive response

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:05.840
to you around, oh, so
you're one of them now.

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.080
OK, fine.

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.760
Or they try and say,
hey, you can tell me.

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.430
What's going on with XYZ?

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:15.345
Well, you know I
can't tell you that.

00:22:15.345 --> 00:22:16.190
Well, why not?

00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.690
It's me.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.064
And there's this expectation
that the relationship really

00:22:19.064 --> 00:22:20.010
hasn't changed.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:23.570
So how you reset
all those boundaries

00:22:23.570 --> 00:22:26.990
and keep a critical network
intact, for some leaders,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:33.940
can just be frustrating
and confusing,

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.540
and they make two mistakes.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:37.190
They do it extremely,
so they really

00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:39.980
become a different person,
or they don't do it at all,

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:41.320
and they stay the buddy.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:43.070
And then their ability
to exert authority,

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:44.712
their ability to make hard
decisions, their ability

00:22:44.712 --> 00:22:46.420
to make decisions that
affect people that

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.640
don't want to be affected
by them is impaired later.

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.440
And so finding
the balance of how

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.990
to reset the boundaries while
keeping relationships intact

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.860
that are now different
is an art form.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:22:58.860
And it can be done.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:22:59.930
There are ways to do it.

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:01.995
But if no one says
to you, hey, you

00:23:01.995 --> 00:23:03.620
need to go sit down
with the people who

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:05.180
used to be your peers
who now report to you

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.220
and have the following
conversation with them.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:09.178
Or, you need to go sit
down with the people who

00:23:09.178 --> 00:23:11.120
you used to report to
who are now peers to you

00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:13.036
and have the following
conversation with them.

00:23:13.036 --> 00:23:15.530
So that everybody goes, oh,
yeah, this is different now.

00:23:15.530 --> 00:23:17.650
And now I know the new rules.

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.530
So those are just
some illustrative

00:23:20.530 --> 00:23:23.607
looks at the landscape
on the way up,

00:23:23.607 --> 00:23:25.690
and the landscape once you
land on the new planet.

00:23:28.804 --> 00:23:30.220
Like I said before,
the great news

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:34.960
was there are predictable things
that those that actually stuck

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.690
the landing and
thrived did when they

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.080
landed that can be learned.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.830
So these were the four things
that the exceptional leaders

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.870
did.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:46.960
We call them choice, context,
connection, and breadth.

00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.910
I'll talk about each
of them individually.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:51.850
So breadth-- these
were the folks

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:55.650
that were able to move
out of a narrow swim lane,

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.870
their discipline, whether it was
a business unit or a functional

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.490
discipline like
finance or marketing,

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:02.350
and see the bigger picture.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:05.110
They were able to understand how
the pieces of the organization

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.130
fit together.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.732
They knew that it was really at
the seams of the organization

00:24:08.732 --> 00:24:10.690
that actual transformation
and change happened.

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:13.120
So they can go from playing
first chair to conductor.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.130
They could build
bridges between people.

00:24:15.130 --> 00:24:17.680
If they grew up in finance,
they didn't see the world

00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:18.299
economically.

00:24:18.299 --> 00:24:19.840
Or if they grew up
in marketing, they

00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:20.830
didn't see the world
through consumers.

00:24:20.830 --> 00:24:23.038
If they grew up in YouTube,
they didn't see the world

00:24:23.038 --> 00:24:23.980
through just video.

00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:27.309
They could actually now
begin to broaden how

00:24:27.309 --> 00:24:28.600
the organization came together.

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.652
The broader your influence
in an organization,

00:24:30.652 --> 00:24:32.860
the more you have to bring
pieces together and see it

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.790
as a whole.

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:36.180
For some leaders who only
could stay in their swim lane

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.596
and see the world
through the lens

00:24:37.596 --> 00:24:41.800
they came in with, struggled
to see how peripheral-- how

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.039
they fit into a bigger story.

00:24:43.039 --> 00:24:45.580
These leaders instantly knew,
I fit into a bigger story here.

00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:47.320
I should want to know
what that story is.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.690
And they went and found out.

00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:54.310
They were able to-- if there was
factions or conflict or border

00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.409
wars among groups, they'd
bring those people together.

00:24:57.409 --> 00:24:59.200
Rather than running
around and negotiating,

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.116
they would bring people
together to force them

00:25:01.116 --> 00:25:04.570
into conversations that
built relationships.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:08.410
So breadth, stitch
the seams around you.

00:25:08.410 --> 00:25:12.700
Bring people together
in interconnection,

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:15.520
rather than letting
them be pulled apart.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.060
Ask yourself, where are there
disconnects among the groups

00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.402
I'm in or leading?

00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:21.610
How do I bring them together?

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.650
For too many leaders,
the failure rate

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:25.240
was an issue of just ignoring.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:27.130
They would aim their
influence at one group

00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:28.771
at the expense of
others, and actually

00:25:28.771 --> 00:25:29.770
make the division worse.

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.730
Context-- so these were the
leaders that were curious.

00:25:38.730 --> 00:25:41.460
They came in and
started asking, what

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.630
is it I have to adapt about
my ideas or my approach

00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:49.080
to fit in with this organization
just enough to be influential?

00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:53.040
They didn't go native,
but they realized

00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:55.462
that this environment has
as much to change in me as I

00:25:55.462 --> 00:25:56.420
have to change in them.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:58.470
So even if I thought
I had some mandate,

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.270
I didn't just go impose it.

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:01.260
I learned.

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:01.920
I adapted.

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.210
I read the tea leaves.

00:26:03.210 --> 00:26:06.720
I asked myself outside,
what influences or trends

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.060
or technologies or
disruptions are coming my way?

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.680
What do I have to anticipate?

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:15.270
What could be unforeseen by me
now that I should know about?

00:26:15.270 --> 00:26:19.140
They were innately
curious about the people

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:21.870
around them and the
business that they were in.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:26.640
So in your case, ask
yourself, of all the ways

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:29.220
Google competes, what's
the actual contribution

00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.080
and value my team creates?

00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:32.207
I know what my tasks are.

00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:33.540
I know what my deliverables are.

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:35.910
But how do I contribute
to the bigger story?

00:26:35.910 --> 00:26:39.570
How do I fit into the
context of Google?

00:26:39.570 --> 00:26:42.360
These leaders would start
with those questions.

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:44.520
The failed leaders
would start by assuming

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:45.960
the answer they
had was the answer

00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:47.520
that everybody else needed.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:51.030
And so being
brilliant, being smart

00:26:51.030 --> 00:26:54.540
was more important to
them than learning.

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:57.600
So read the
environment around you.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.450
And resist the need
to be constrained

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:02.370
by near-term results.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:05.222
Actually set your sights
on longer-term-- learn,

00:27:05.222 --> 00:27:07.680
as much as it is difficult when
other people are pressuring

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.810
you, to stay focused on
longer-term outcomes.

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:21.900
So choice-- turns
out decision-making

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:25.830
was a major impediment
for some leaders,

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:28.500
in terms of being able
to disappoint people.

00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.020
Leadership is the ability
to disappoint people

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.910
at a rate they can absorb.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.140
So if you're somebody
who says yes too much

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.570
because you want
to please people,

00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:40.020
or you don't want to deal with
the rejection of people being

00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:44.290
angry at you for disappointing
them, leadership will be hard.

00:27:44.290 --> 00:27:48.480
But narrowing the
focus of a group--

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.720
how many of you have
ever said, or thought,

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:54.390
I have just enough priorities?

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:54.990
Nobody.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.360
How many of you have said,
we have too many priorities?

00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:57.990
Right?

00:27:57.990 --> 00:28:00.900
We all feel overworked,
overstretched, unfocused.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.850
So what's the alternative?

00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:04.860
My only choice is,
OK, whatever you're

00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.660
screaming about today,
that's what's important.

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.660
That's the priority.

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:11.400
Not, I'm clear on
the three things

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.791
that are the most critical.

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:14.040
The other things I can let go.

00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.870
I know where to
make my trade-offs.

00:28:15.870 --> 00:28:18.210
These leaders could
not only themselves,

00:28:18.210 --> 00:28:21.450
but help those they lead,
make the hard trade-offs.

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.600
And they narrowed the focus of
the people to just a few things

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.190
to do them with excellence.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:28.050
Nobody wants to come
to work and feel

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:32.110
like I get to do a bunch
of things mediocre.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:35.400
But given the number of
priorities, or the urgent thing

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.090
de jour that you bring
up, I have no capacity

00:28:39.090 --> 00:28:41.277
to understand what's
really important.

00:28:41.277 --> 00:28:43.110
These leaders could
construct great choices.

00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:46.320
They knew what data,
what intuition,

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.390
and what other voices
they should include

00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:49.740
to construct a great decision.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.160
They weren't overly
cowboy-like and independent,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.210
and they weren't overly
false-consensus-driven,

00:28:54.210 --> 00:28:55.668
where I want to
make sure everybody

00:28:55.668 --> 00:28:58.644
feels included when I don't
really need to include them.

00:28:58.644 --> 00:29:00.810
How many of you have ever
been in a meeting, or part

00:29:00.810 --> 00:29:03.180
of a decision,
where you show up,

00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:05.250
and the leader starts
talking about a decision

00:29:05.250 --> 00:29:08.360
that you can already tell
they've already made?

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.340
We call that faux inclusion.

00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:13.190
Those leaders get
found out, right?

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:17.300
So you're sitting
there thinking, really?

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:19.760
You're going to make me do
this fake dance with you?

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:23.840
Watched a-- a consumer
electronics CEO--

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:27.620
I was having a regular
check-in with him one day.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:30.900
And his assistant buzzed him
and said, hey, Chad's here.

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:32.210
Do you want to see him?

00:29:32.210 --> 00:29:33.590
And so he said yes, send him in.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.048
I said, do you want
me to step out?

00:29:35.048 --> 00:29:35.780
He said, no, no.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:39.320
So in walks Chad, their IT
head, tattooed and pierced

00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.594
everywhere.

00:29:41.594 --> 00:29:42.260
And he walks up.

00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:46.776
And I see my client,
Barry, pull out a file.

00:29:46.776 --> 00:29:48.650
And I'm like, OK, this
is going to be boring.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.900
So I just take out my phone,
and I start dissociating.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.690
But I'm eavesdropping.

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:57.980
And Barry says, hey, I sent this
IT capital plan to the board.

00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.039
Just want to make sure--

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.580
before I send it to
the board, I want

00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:02.538
to make sure you're OK
with what I've committed

00:30:02.538 --> 00:30:05.485
to for technology next year.

00:30:05.485 --> 00:30:08.090
Well, I don't hear
Chad saying anything.

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:11.110
So I kind of peek up, and Chad's
got this really contorted look

00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:13.610
on his face.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:16.124
And he says, well,
I don't really

00:30:16.124 --> 00:30:17.540
know what you're
asking me, Barry.

00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:19.360
I know you already
signed off on that

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.030
and sent it to the
board yesterday.

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:23.480
So if you're asking me
to be OK with it, fine.

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.090
But don't ask my
opinion on something

00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:27.780
you've already decided to do.

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.070
And he left.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.710
And I could see Barry's
neck getting all red,

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.510
and he turns to me,
and he goes, do you

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:34.990
see the kind of disrespect?

00:30:34.990 --> 00:30:37.560
I said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:40.890
Barry, what is it you
think just happened here?

00:30:40.890 --> 00:30:42.820
I'm a CEO, [ANGRY NOISES].

00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:44.200
I said, no, no, no, no.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.860
Barry, my script
says you got caught.

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:48.694
He called you.

00:30:48.694 --> 00:30:50.610
You were trying to pull
the wool over his eyes

00:30:50.610 --> 00:30:52.950
to make him think he was part
of something he wasn't, and you

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:53.820
got caught for it.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:56.900
My script says your
next line is, I'm sorry.

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.237
He gave you a gift.

00:30:58.237 --> 00:31:00.570
He gave you the belief that
he trusted your relationship

00:31:00.570 --> 00:31:03.950
enough to tell you the truth.

00:31:03.950 --> 00:31:07.640
Your next move is to walk
down the hall and apologize,

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.809
not to be all up in
arms here, like--

00:31:09.809 --> 00:31:11.600
you weren't the one
that got offended here.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.300
He was.

00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.010
And they went on to have
a great relationship.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:19.615
But if you can't make the hard
choices honestly to the people

00:31:19.615 --> 00:31:22.240
you have to make them to and let
the chips fall where they may,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:24.250
leadership won't
be easy for you,

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:25.930
because sometimes
it means saying,

00:31:25.930 --> 00:31:27.910
this is what needs to
be done, or no, we're

00:31:27.910 --> 00:31:30.300
not going to do that, or
this needs to be done,

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.800
and I'm sorry it's going
to take some sacrifice.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.190
We can't call that from our
people and model it ourselves.

00:31:36.190 --> 00:31:39.400
Decision-making, especially
when your decisions

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.340
affect resources, priorities,
people's sense of importance,

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.010
how they spend
their time, how they

00:31:45.010 --> 00:31:47.530
use their discretionary
influence,

00:31:47.530 --> 00:31:52.170
if they feel jacked around,
your ability to be influential

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:53.470
is going to be impaired.

00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:54.580
So this was a hard one.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:31:58.150
One of the interesting things
we found about when people

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:01.240
had power in their
roles was that we

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:04.732
assumed we would find the
Harvey Weinsteins of the world.

00:32:04.732 --> 00:32:06.440
You know, we'd find
people misusing power

00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:08.710
for self-gain and self-interest
and immoral reasons.

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:09.670
They were there.

00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:13.420
That was not nearly
the abuse of power

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.360
as much as it was
people abandoning power.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.010
People were too
afraid to use it.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.030
They let go of it.

00:32:20.030 --> 00:32:22.510
And we need to see
that as as much

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.930
of an abuse of power
as self-interest,

00:32:25.930 --> 00:32:27.600
is self-protection.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.190
If you're too uncomfortable
using power, don't take it.

00:32:32.190 --> 00:32:34.650
But if you can't exercise
power to make things

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.750
more just, to make
things more fair,

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.610
to make things more
clear, to make things

00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:40.830
more compelling for people,
then decision-making

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:43.230
will be a struggle.

00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:47.600
And the last dimension
was connection.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.715
So these were the people
everybody wanted to work for.

00:32:50.715 --> 00:32:53.090
So how many of you have leaders
that you have seen this--

00:32:53.090 --> 00:32:55.410
there's the " I could
work for her or him" boss?

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:55.910
Right.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.490
So it's those people.

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:00.140
So they're trustworthy.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.380
They're compelling.

00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.270
They're credible.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.440
They're respected.

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.540
But one of the major
differentiators

00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:07.640
was that everybody
believed that they

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.130
were out to make other
people successful,

00:33:10.130 --> 00:33:12.920
that the thing on their
agenda highest in relationship

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.690
was, how do I help you succeed?

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:18.500
One guy in our study said he
asks everybody three questions.

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.960
He asks first, what can
I do to improve to be

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.910
a better colleague to you?

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.310
Second, what are you working
on that's really important?

00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:26.970
And three, what can I do to help
you with that really important

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:27.960
thing?

00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.160
And for a decade, this was his
mantra, and everybody knew it.

00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:32.750
And everybody knew he meant it.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.540
And so the interesting
differentiator was,

00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.370
I didn't build my
stakeholder network

00:33:37.370 --> 00:33:40.400
and focus on relationships that
I could get something from.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.530
I focused on building
relationships with--

00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:47.090
and this is peers, direct
reports, and bosses, all 360.

00:33:47.090 --> 00:33:48.740
How do I make other
people successful?

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.750
Not politically, but
because I genuinely

00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:52.580
enjoyed watching
other people thrive.

00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:55.760
I genuinely enjoyed watching
how I make other people soar.

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.935
And this was innate to
who these folks were.

00:33:58.935 --> 00:34:01.060
And that's how they maintained
their relationships,

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.143
and that's how they built
credibility and respect.

00:34:03.143 --> 00:34:05.500
So you can see, breadth,
context, choice,

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.580
connection-- they're four
really powerful and big muscles,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:11.710
and why it was
hard to say you've

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.920
got to be good at all four.

00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.090
But if you want to succeed and
be influential on the way up

00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:22.020
and navigate those
landmines on the way up

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.719
and navigate the
disorientation of being higher,

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:26.400
you can learn these now.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.960
For context, start
asking questions around

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.570
how you can adapt more to
the environment you're in.

00:34:33.570 --> 00:34:36.760
For breadth, ask, what
seams can I bridge?

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.699
What seams do I sit at that
I can connect better to?

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:45.698
For choice, ask yourself, how
comfortable am I saying no?

00:34:45.698 --> 00:34:47.489
How comfortable am I
disappointing somebody

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:48.630
for the right thing?

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:50.340
And for connection,
ask yourself,

00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:53.040
do the people in your
network understand

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.620
you to be somebody who is
out to make them successful?

00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:57.900
If somebody went and asked
on your behalf, what's

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.025
it like to work with you,
would they say, oh, yeah,

00:35:00.025 --> 00:35:01.720
they have my back?

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:04.960
So you can start now to
build these capabilities

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.217
and layer them into
your leadership

00:35:07.217 --> 00:35:09.550
so that as you become more
influential, and one day when

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:12.464
you're a CEO of Google or a
CEO of some other company here,

00:35:12.464 --> 00:35:15.130
you can have the impact you want
to have and make the difference

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:17.330
you want to make
and be successful.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:20.120
So, thanks.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:24.700
And so we'll do Q&amp;A. We have
time for some questions.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.945
So what do you want
to know more about?

00:35:27.945 --> 00:35:29.820
And there's a microphone
in the corner there.

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:34.749
So please go use that
microphone to ask your question.

00:35:34.749 --> 00:35:35.290
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:38.240
So I actually-- first of all,
thank you very much for coming.

00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.220
This is fantastic.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.170
RON CARUCCI: Thanks.

00:35:40.170 --> 00:35:43.970
AUDIENCE: I actually
have two questions.

00:35:43.970 --> 00:35:46.450
The first is, I guess
I was a little confused

00:35:46.450 --> 00:35:50.680
between how to distinguish
between the context

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:53.230
source of power and the
breadth source of power.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:57.340
They both seem to
be about having

00:35:57.340 --> 00:36:00.460
an understanding of the bigger
picture and elaborating there.

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:02.260
So I was hoping you
could elaborate on sort

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.190
of what makes those unique.

00:36:03.190 --> 00:36:04.398
RON CARUCCI: Great questions.

00:36:04.398 --> 00:36:07.180
Context is depth.

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.200
So it's deep.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.790
And breadth is wide.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:13.930
So context is about what's
happening right now, in front

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:16.330
of me, that I need to adapt to.

00:36:16.330 --> 00:36:19.080
Breadth is the puzzle,
so all the puzzle pieces

00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.600
and how they fit together.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.640
So if I'm in YouTube,
where does YouTube

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:24.730
fit into the broader
Google strategy?

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.560
What's the bigger
story we're a part of?

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.050
Context is, what's Vimeo doing
that I need to care about

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.492
right now in my job?

00:36:33.492 --> 00:36:34.200
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.640
And having both simultaneously
will allow you to traverse.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.420
RON CARUCCI: Yes.

00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.340
And so that's a great point.

00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:41.082
It's all four of
them simultaneous,

00:36:41.082 --> 00:36:42.790
because for me to act
upon that question,

00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:44.539
I have to have the
relationships to do it.

00:36:44.539 --> 00:36:47.630
I have to make the hard
choices to make it happen.

00:36:47.630 --> 00:36:51.430
So this is one thing with
four parts, not four things.

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.800
That's what makes it tricky.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.140
AUDIENCE: And I guess
the second question is,

00:36:57.140 --> 00:37:00.160
you mentioned earlier on about
all the different pitfalls,

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.670
and those who had established
poor relationships.

00:37:03.670 --> 00:37:06.460
If somebody has
walked down that path

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:11.500
and has sort of a negative
reputation preceding them,

00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:13.960
in your experience, are
they able to turn it

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.250
around by learning the skills?

00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.560
Or should they be moving
into greener pastures?

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.101
RON CARUCCI: That's
a great question.

00:37:18.101 --> 00:37:19.590
Yes, they can.

00:37:19.590 --> 00:37:21.550
And if you're in
the same environment

00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:23.050
that you already
expect people to be

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:25.990
looking at you a certain way,
you have to confront that.

00:37:25.990 --> 00:37:27.820
You have to say, I
understand you all

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.440
see me from this experience.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.190
I'm asking you not to.

00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:33.580
And I'm asking you to let
me earn my right to regain

00:37:33.580 --> 00:37:35.600
your trust and respect.

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:37.510
If I don't do that,
I want to be told,

00:37:37.510 --> 00:37:39.426
but I want to be innocent
until proven guilty.

00:37:39.426 --> 00:37:42.040
So can you give me the
suspension of disbelief

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.170
and allow me to succeed here?

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:46.090
And you have to ask for it.

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:48.040
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:49.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you for coming.

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:51.098
Would you mind sharing
some of the things

00:37:51.098 --> 00:37:54.100
that you found either
most surprising

00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:57.130
or that seem to be
most counterintuitive

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:58.360
about your research?

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.526
RON CARUCCI: Great question.

00:37:59.526 --> 00:38:00.760
Thank you.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.610
The power thing really
took us off guard,

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.400
that the biggest abuse
of it was abandoning it,

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.280
that people are more
cowardice than they are--

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.530
can I say "asshole"-- assholes.

00:38:11.530 --> 00:38:13.300
We have those,
but they're just--

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.430
and sometimes the
reason for the cowardice

00:38:15.430 --> 00:38:19.650
was so that I avoid
being seen as a jerk.

00:38:19.650 --> 00:38:21.610
But you took the job.

00:38:21.610 --> 00:38:25.540
You have all these C letters
next to your name now.

00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.660
But I think people are
not trained to understand

00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:30.997
that power is a great thing.

00:38:30.997 --> 00:38:32.830
You don't have to be
self-indulgent with it.

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:36.130
But you have the ability
to create justice.

00:38:36.130 --> 00:38:38.350
You can take things that
are not fair or not right

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:39.550
and make them right.

00:38:39.550 --> 00:38:42.400
And that should be
exciting to you.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:46.180
So that surprised me, because
why would you want the job?

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:48.430
The other thing that surprised
us that I didn't like--

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:49.930
I told you this
before-- was I hated

00:38:49.930 --> 00:38:52.364
that you had to be good
at all four of these,

00:38:52.364 --> 00:38:54.280
because I don't feel
good at all four of them.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:57.220
So I didn't feel good about
telling others to do it.

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:59.094
And so I really
wanted it to be true

00:38:59.094 --> 00:39:01.510
that the good ones who rise
up could do three of the four,

00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:04.430
at least, and have a couple
of rough edges on one of them.

00:39:04.430 --> 00:39:07.870
And the truth is,
some of us do, right?

00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:09.670
The other thing that
surprised me was--

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:14.970
anybody here from HR?

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:17.190
I'm gonna say [INAUDIBLE],,
but I'll pretend.

00:39:17.190 --> 00:39:22.380
So, so many of the devices
of the early failure issues

00:39:22.380 --> 00:39:25.000
are HR processes.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.100
Selection, reward,
development, all the--

00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:30.670
and I was surprised
because I come out of HR.

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:32.830
At some point in my
career, I spent time there.

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:35.170
I was surprised that--

00:39:35.170 --> 00:39:35.950
we could fix them.

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.990
Why aren't we fixing them?

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:42.800
So I was frustrated and
exasperated by that.

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.390
Thanks for the question.

00:39:44.390 --> 00:39:45.890
AUDIENCE: Hi, I
just had a question.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:52.320
Did the research
suggest that people

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:55.910
were self-aware of their gaps
in these four dimensions?

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:59.060
Or was it sort of like
they didn't realize it

00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:02.590
until after they had completely
failed, and that sort of thing?

00:40:02.590 --> 00:40:05.090
RON CARUCCI: I so wish I could
answer the question with yes,

00:40:05.090 --> 00:40:05.590
they were.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:07.010
But they weren't.

00:40:07.010 --> 00:40:09.380
So that young man
who I told you I

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:11.902
got the phone call about,
his failure was context.

00:40:11.902 --> 00:40:13.735
He had a failure of
just not reading the tea

00:40:13.735 --> 00:40:14.790
leaves around him.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.710
He got so overwhelmed with
the complexity of his job,

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:20.909
he just ignored it--

00:40:20.909 --> 00:40:23.200
not because he couldn't have
learned it, because no one

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:24.760
told him to.

00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:29.270
And so it was usually, to
your question, after the fact.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:31.060
And so often, so
many of them-- when

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:33.460
we talked to some of
the failure cases,

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:36.712
over and over, why
didn't someone tell me?

00:40:36.712 --> 00:40:38.170
If I had known they
were frustrated

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:40.150
with my frustration
with them because they

00:40:40.150 --> 00:40:42.800
weren't taking my good
idea, I could have changed.

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:45.100
People just backed away
and didn't say anything.

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.160
I tell leaders all the time,
if you went to a dinner party

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:51.040
with a significant other and
you decided to leave early,

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.123
and your significant other
turns to you in the car

00:40:53.123 --> 00:40:56.660
and says, honey, you have
a big thing hanging off

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.490
the end of your nose.

00:40:58.490 --> 00:40:59.520
Get it off.

00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:02.070
It's been there all night.

00:41:02.070 --> 00:41:04.400
What might your question be?

00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.540
You tell me now?

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.870
We all have Things hanging
off our behavior we can't see.

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:11.420
Get in on the conversation.

00:41:11.420 --> 00:41:12.420
You should want to know.

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.180
And so you should always be
asking, how can I do better?

00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:16.680
What am I doing
that frustrates you?

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:17.490
What can I improve?

00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:21.240
If you just ask
for the feedback--

00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.280
and don't wait
until it's too late.

00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:25.502
You can ask today.

00:41:25.502 --> 00:41:27.210
You can leave here
today, go to somebody,

00:41:27.210 --> 00:41:30.450
and say, what's the thing
we're talking about on my nose

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:32.840
that no one's telling me about?

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:35.562
And find a colleague that's
honest enough to tell you.

00:41:35.562 --> 00:41:37.520
SPEAKER 1: All right,
Rob, we've got a question

00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.460
from the livestream audience.

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:41.469
RON CARUCCI: Oh, cool.

00:41:41.469 --> 00:41:43.010
SPEAKER 1: So the
question is around,

00:41:43.010 --> 00:41:46.370
how do you get businesspeople
who are the agents of change

00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.614
here to actually abide
by these recommendations?

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.310
RON CARUCCI: Give
them my phone number.

00:41:54.310 --> 00:41:55.960
I would love to have
a chat with them.

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.900
You know, here's the
painful question.

00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.950
If you don't look
at these four--

00:41:59.950 --> 00:42:01.770
so we were very
humbled and honored

00:42:01.770 --> 00:42:04.270
that "HBR" named this as one
of the ideas that mattered most

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:05.370
in 2016.

00:42:05.370 --> 00:42:08.720
When we published this research,
we had hundreds of thousands--

00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.600
our website was almost crashing,
because people were like, yes!

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.910
But if you don't recognize the
self-evident obviousness of,

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:19.634
yes, that's what
I should do, then

00:42:19.634 --> 00:42:20.800
you don't believe it, right?

00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.330
But the question I would ask
is, OK, so if it's not these,

00:42:24.330 --> 00:42:25.532
then what?

00:42:25.532 --> 00:42:27.865
If you don't think that these
are the standards of being

00:42:27.865 --> 00:42:29.906
able to be influential,
2,700 people in the study

00:42:29.906 --> 00:42:32.760
wasn't enough, OK, I'll
suspend my disbelief.

00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:34.690
You tell me what they are.

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.820
You tell me, what are
the success factors

00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.780
that you want to abide by or
apply to your own behavior

00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:43.330
or pursue to be successful?

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:47.500
And then show me who else has
been successful with them.

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.910
That's what I would ask.

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:52.280
But otherwise, my
question would be,

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.050
if you're rising
up with influence

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:58.430
and you're rising up to want
to have broader change, what

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:01.170
standards are you using?

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:04.387
If you're making it up as
you go, if you're thinking,

00:43:04.387 --> 00:43:06.720
I'm all that and a bag of
chips and I've already arrived

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.520
and I have what I
need, you're dangerous.

00:43:14.339 --> 00:43:14.880
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:17.060
What recommendations do
you have for seeking out

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:18.969
mentorship and coaching?

00:43:18.969 --> 00:43:19.760
RON CARUCCI: Do it.

00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.120
So it's a very
personal issue, right?

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:29.930
So you want a relationship
that's mutually beneficial.

00:43:29.930 --> 00:43:34.220
You don't want someone to
clone themselves in you.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.466
And I think those
are different--

00:43:36.466 --> 00:43:37.840
I think mentorship
is a much more

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:40.460
intimate, ongoing relationship.

00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.220
Coaching should
start with feedback.

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:43.570
If you're going to
hire a coach, please

00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.190
make sure they're
trained and certified

00:43:45.190 --> 00:43:46.570
and not somebody
who somebody said,

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:47.653
hey, you give good advice!

00:43:47.653 --> 00:43:49.105
You should be a coach!

00:43:49.105 --> 00:43:50.230
They all hang shingles out.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:51.680
It's bad.

00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.260
The industry has become this--

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:53.990
it's terrible.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.020
There's people out there
just dispensing advice

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.145
because someone told them--
their mother told them,

00:43:58.145 --> 00:43:59.904
you're so smart!

00:43:59.904 --> 00:44:02.070
So make sure somebody has
got some clinical training

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:03.569
and some behavioral
science training

00:44:03.569 --> 00:44:06.346
and knows what they're
coaching you in.

00:44:06.346 --> 00:44:08.140
And get feedback.

00:44:08.140 --> 00:44:12.230
I hired a coach two
years ago for me.

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:14.355
And people were like, at
this point in your career?

00:44:14.355 --> 00:44:16.090
You probably think
it's too late.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.140
But it's never too late.

00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:19.450
And all I have
thought for two years

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:21.970
was, why did I wait so long?

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:23.790
Help is so good.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:25.900
I mean, none of us
can do this alone.

00:44:25.900 --> 00:44:31.220
And if you think you can,
please don't lead anybody.

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.780
So the idea of getting help,
and having somebody-- we

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:37.210
are notoriously bad
observers of our own reality.

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.890
We don't have good third eyes.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:40.510
So having another
set of eyes on you

00:44:40.510 --> 00:44:41.885
and how you function
in the world

00:44:41.885 --> 00:44:44.950
and how others experience you,
even if you have people getting

00:44:44.950 --> 00:44:46.690
in your face and
being honest, still,

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:48.810
to have an objective
third party tell you,

00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:50.350
here's who you are to the world.

00:44:50.350 --> 00:44:51.770
Now, if that's not what you
want to be to the world,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:53.061
here's how you can change that.

00:44:53.061 --> 00:44:54.010
What a gift!

00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:57.151
And the earlier you
do it, the better.

00:44:57.151 --> 00:44:59.400
I tell every one of my clients
who run big departments

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:01.470
or companies, I want--
you have to have--

00:45:01.470 --> 00:45:03.640
I want to be your
coach, and I want

00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:06.760
the name of your therapist,
your personal trainer,

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:09.166
and your nutritionist.

00:45:09.166 --> 00:45:10.880
There's a foursome there.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:12.910
You should not be
running tens of thousands

00:45:12.910 --> 00:45:14.410
of people and
billions of dollars

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:18.410
of budgets without at least,
if not more, those four things

00:45:18.410 --> 00:45:18.910
around you.

00:45:23.104 --> 00:45:25.520
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks for coming.

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.650
According to the study,
a majority of people

00:45:27.650 --> 00:45:31.660
didn't have all four,
hence the failure rate.

00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:33.410
For the people who
have three out of four,

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:35.034
was there a normal
distribution, or did

00:45:35.034 --> 00:45:37.940
you see that one particular
quadrant was just

00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:39.452
really hard for people to--

00:45:39.452 --> 00:45:40.910
RON CARUCCI: Such
a great question.

00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:45.620
So context and connection
caused faster failure.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.410
So in the 18-month window,
the six-month failures

00:45:51.410 --> 00:45:52.890
were all failures of connection.

00:45:52.890 --> 00:45:56.570
And specifically, peers
and direct reports

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:59.320
could pull the plug on your
career quicker than anybody.

00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.400
Bosses were a little
bit out of sight.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.714
Context was you're
obtuse, right?

00:46:06.714 --> 00:46:08.630
The interesting thing
about choice and breadth

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:11.420
was the failures came
later, because here's why.

00:46:11.420 --> 00:46:14.060
So if your company
sucks at decision-making

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:15.990
and your governance
structures are unclear

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.920
and it's either all false
consensus or all cowboy,

00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.970
you'll blend right in.

00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:21.909
People won't know you
suck at decision-making.

00:46:21.909 --> 00:46:23.450
And if your company
sucks at breadth,

00:46:23.450 --> 00:46:25.575
meaning it's very fragmented,
very siloed, and very

00:46:25.575 --> 00:46:27.440
individualistic and
very piecemealed,

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.670
you'll fit right in.

00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:31.707
The problem becomes after you're
trying to fight that, right?

00:46:31.707 --> 00:46:34.040
So if you're trying to introduce
better decision-making,

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:35.790
because you're good
at it and they're not,

00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.620
or you're trying to bridge
the seams and you get resisted

00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:43.887
and no one else is on that same
mission, you fail, but slower.

00:46:43.887 --> 00:46:44.470
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:46.400
I'd love to hear
some of your thoughts

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.370
on how to build trust
and relationship to get

00:46:49.370 --> 00:46:52.070
some of that honest
feedback, beyond just asking.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.630
How do you actually
get the real answer?

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:56.930
RON CARUCCI: So you have
to commit to other people's

00:46:56.930 --> 00:46:58.582
success, right?

00:46:58.582 --> 00:47:01.040
And find a couple of people,
find a couple of peer coaches,

00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.930
or get a small group
together and say, hey, can we

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:04.138
have each other's backs here?

00:47:04.138 --> 00:47:06.440
And there are some
great tools out there.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:07.610
Come to our website.

00:47:07.610 --> 00:47:10.971
We've got some great
tools to offer on,

00:47:10.971 --> 00:47:13.220
how are we going to learn
to give each other feedback?

00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:15.770
And how are we going to learn
to-- so in this meeting,

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:16.700
I'm about to give
this presentation.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.574
Or, in this meeting,
I'm about to go do this.

00:47:18.574 --> 00:47:20.720
Can you watch for
the following things?

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.410
It takes courage to ask.

00:47:22.410 --> 00:47:24.390
But if you find people
with whom you have--

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:26.060
the colleagues.

00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:29.510
If you don't have the
trust there, then ask them,

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:32.030
what would it take for us,
over the next few months,

00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:33.940
to build the kind of
trust with each other?

00:47:33.940 --> 00:47:36.080
And just say, I've
observed your insights.

00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.010
You seem someone who
has a lot to offer.

00:47:38.010 --> 00:47:39.140
I'd love your feedback.

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:40.782
And I recognize that
maybe right now we

00:47:40.782 --> 00:47:41.990
don't have that relationship.

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.840
But how, over the next
90 days, can we do that?

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:46.060
Lunch once a week?

00:47:46.060 --> 00:47:47.420
But be intentional about it.

00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:48.740
And people appreciate that.

00:47:48.740 --> 00:47:51.350
But be very-- those
relationships are made, not

00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:53.620
born.

00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:55.652
Yeah.

00:47:55.652 --> 00:47:57.110
Guys, thanks so
much for having me.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:57.790
It's been great to be with you.

00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:58.990
Enjoy your holiday.

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:02.340
[APPLAUSE]
