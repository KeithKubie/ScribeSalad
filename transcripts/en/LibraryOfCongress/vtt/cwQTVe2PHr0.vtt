&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Is this on?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.160
Ooh, it got quiet.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.720
To start the day, good morning.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.020
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.320
&gt;&gt; Amy Stolls: Woo-hoo.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.510
Welcome to the 2018 National
Book Festival: Here we go.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.060
[ Applause ]

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.580
I want to welcome you especially
to the Poetry and Prose Stage

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.400
which has been supported by the
National Endowment for the Arts,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.660
the NEA, since the
Festival began.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.940
And we're proud to
continue that support.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.020
My name is Amy Stolls and I
direct the Literature Program

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.410
at the NEA where we
celebrate literature as an art

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.710
and essential reflection

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.780
of our nation's rich
diversity of voices.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.610
And we do this by
helping writers

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.890
and translators create new
work and connect with audiences

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.180
through publishers and
other literary organization

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.030
and programs like
the NEA Big Read

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.400
which supports communities
coming together to read

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.370
and discuss one book,
and like Poetry Out Loud

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.810
which you're going to
hear about very shortly,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.670
and like this Festival.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.070
And there are several members

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160
of the NEA Literature
Team here today.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.550
They are floating around.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.340
You can see some of them.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.920
They're not in the back.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.840
They're probably around
[inaudible] oh, hello.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.340
They are standing by ready
to answer your questions.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.670
And though after each session
will be back at the table

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.570
where we have free stuff for
you if you'd like to pick it up.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.080
And we have a terrific line-up
for you today on this stage.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.650
I'm going to turn the
mic over to, in a minute,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.490
over to the superb and superbly
unflinching Lauren Miller

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.520
who managers the Poetry Out
Loud Program for the NEA

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.270
in partnership with
the equally superb

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.780
and superbly unflinching Steve
Young at the Poetry Foundation.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.350
But before I do, I want
to give a shout-out

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.200
to the five national student
poets from around the country

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160
who have been chosen among
the national medalists

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.090
in the Scholastic Art
and Writing Awards

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.120
for their original poetry.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.090
They just received their
awards from the Library

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.290
of Congress yesterday, on behalf
-- the Librarian of Congress --

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.110
on behalf of the Institute of
Museum and Library Services

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.710
and the Alliance for
Young Artists and Writers.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.510
And can I ask you guys just
to stand up and be recognized.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:12.600
[ Applause and Cheering ]

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.900
Thank you.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.410
I really think it's
students like these and these

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.910
who are going to save the world.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.210
I have no doubt.

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.690
So here we go.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.990
Let the games begin.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.290
Lauren.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.380
&gt;&gt; Lauren Miller: Hello.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.680
Good morning, everyone.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:34.980
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.280
&gt;&gt; Lauren Miller: Good morning.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.490
As Amy said, my name is Lauren
Miller and I manage the Poetry

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.650
Out Loud Program at the
National Endowment for the Arts.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.310
On behalf of everyone at
the NEA, thank you so much

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.650
for joining us here
this morning.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.980
So, first off, I'm going
to tell you a little bit

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.670
about the program and then I'll
introduce our wonderful guests

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.590
here on stage, and you'll
get a first-hand experience

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.860
of the power of poetry
being read aloud.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.780
So Poetry Out Loud is a National
Youth Arts Program that seeks

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.810
to foster the next generation of
literary readers by capitalizing

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.050
on the latest trends in poetry,
recitation and performance.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.880
Poetry Out Loud encourages
high school students to learn

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.630
about the classic and
contemporary poetry

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.390
through memorization
and public recitation.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.430
Started in 2005 as a partnership
between the National Endowment

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.820
for the Arts, the Poetry
Foundation, and the 53 state

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.030
and jurisdictional
Arts Agencies,

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.330
Poetry Out Loud has grown

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.230
to serve more then 3.6 million
students and 55,000 teachers

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.640
from 14,000 high
schools nationwide.

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.270
This means that Poetry Out
Loud is in very state, D.C.,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.590
Puerto Rico, and the
U.S. Virgin Islands.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.190
This program helps students
master public speaking skills,

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.350
build self-confidence,
and most importantly,

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.800
discover their own
creative voice.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.360
If poetry recitation sounds a
bit dry to you, just you wait.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.580
In a few minutes you'll see the
students here on stage recite.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.920
And they're phenomenal, and I
can't wait for you to see them.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.770
So you may be wondering how
does Poetry Out Loud work.

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.400
So Poetry Out Loud uses
a pyramid structure

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.230
that starts in the classroom.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.960
Winners in the classroom advance
to school-wide competition,

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.640
then to a regional and/or
a state final competition,

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.370
and then ultimately at the
national finals which is here

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.170
in Washington, D.C.
every spring.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:26.980
Poetry Out Loud students
are eligible for prizes

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.280
at the same national levels

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.000
of competition including
a $20,000 prize

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.610
for the National Champion.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.320
And every year, Poetry Out
Loud awards more than $100,000

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.800
in prizes and school stipends

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.550
for the purchase of
poetry materials.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.300
So, now if I've peaked your
attention regarding prizes,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.650
for any interested high
school students or teachers

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.900
in the audience, it's not
too late to participate.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.310
Please visit the
table in the back.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.090
We're giving away
free teachers' guides

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.250
for the 2018/'19 school year.

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.700
And we also have a
wonderful website dedicated

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.290
to the program,
poetryoutloud.org which has more

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.930
than 900 eligible
poems, video recitations,

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.950
and a comprehensive
teacher's guide.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.730
Last year, more than
300,000 high school students

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:13.540
participated in Poetry Out
Loud, and today you'll hear

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.800
from two state champions who had
it all the way to the top nine

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.470
at the National Finals.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.960
So let's now introduce
our guests

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.050
and moderator to the stage.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.140
Nicholas Amador is
the 2018 Hawaii Poetry

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.040
National Finalist.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.590
Nick is a first-year student at
Harvard studying Astrophysics.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:39.030

sing, act, and write poetry.

He is currently reading
<i>Infinite Jest </i>by David

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.420
Foster Wallace.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.870
He passionately wants to grow
a beard and for the first time

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.030
in his life he feels like
he truly can [laughter].

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.870
Next up is Xiadi Zhai.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:55.240
Xiadi is the 2018 Massachusetts

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.510

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.150
Xiadi is from Boston and

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.260

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.060
She's considering studying
Chemistry and English,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:09.810
but is excited to explore
all opportunities available

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.110
in college.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.760
In her free time she
enjoys running, writing,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.800
and meeting new dogs
in her neighborhood,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.820
including their owners.

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.300
Finally, we're extremely honored
and pleased to be joined by Poet

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.110
and Poetry Out Loud
National Semi-Finals Judge,

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:26.730

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:30.120
Javier is going to lead today's
discussion with out students.

So, without further
ado, please join me

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.510
in welcoming Javier,
Nick, and Xiadi.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:16.600
[ Applause ]

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.640
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: So what
I thought for this panel --

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.940
I want to introduce all of you
to the poetry, so they're going

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.910
to perform one poem and then
we're going to talk about it.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:31.440
And at the end, they're going
to close it up with a poem.

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:34.810
And do one of you want to start?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:36.390
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I'll start.

00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:37.690
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Sure.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.990
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: Okay.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.970
"Degrees of Gray in
Philipsburg" by Richard Hugo.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:54.910
You might come here
Sunday on a whim.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.110
Say your life broke down.

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:02.730
The last good kiss
you had was years ago.

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.780
You walk these streets
laid out by the insane,

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:15.530
past hotels that didn't last,
bars that did, the tortured try

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:20.790
of local drivers to
accelerate their lives.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.650
Only churches are kept up.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.390
The jail turned 70 this year.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:34.750
The only prisoner is always
in, not knowing what he's done.

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:42.040
The principal supporting
business now is rage.

00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.720
Hatred of the various
grays the mountain sends,

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.650
hatred of the mill,
the Silver Bill repeal,

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.280
the best-liked girls who
leave each year for Butte.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:03.410
One good restaurant and bars
can't wipe the boredom out.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:08.630
The 1907 boom, eight
going silver mines,

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:12.030
a dance floor built
on springs --

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:17.770
all memory resolves
itself in gaze,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:23.390
in panoramic green you know the
cattle eat or two stacks high

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:28.440
above the town, two dead kilns,
the huge mill in collapse

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.980
for fifty years that
won't fall finally down.

00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:40.750
Isn't this your life?

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:44.760
That ancient kiss still
burning out your eyes?

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.950
Isn't this defeat so accurate,

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:51.740
the church bell simply
seems a pure announcement:

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.870
ring and no one comes?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:10:01.330
Don't empty houses ring?

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:09.210
Are magnesium and scorn
sufficient to support a town,

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:18.660
not just Philipsburg, but towns
of towering blondes, good jazz,

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:24.530
and booze the world
will never let you have

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.670
until the town you
came from dies inside?

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.670
Say no to yourself.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.650
The old man, twenty
when the jail was built,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:46.930
still laughs although
his lips collapse.

00:10:46.930 --> 00:10:54.760
Someday soon, he says, I'll
go to sleep and not wake up.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:59.050
You tell him no.

00:10:59.050 --> 00:11:02.010
You're talking to yourself.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.350
The car that brought
you here still runs.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.210
The money you buy lunch with,
no matter where it's mined,

00:11:10.210 --> 00:11:17.240
is silver, and the girl who
serves your food is slender

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.970
and her red hair
lights the wall.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:27.170
[ Applause ]

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:28.470
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Thank you.

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:29.770
It's different being up on stage

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.380
because usually I'm
in the audience.

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:34.110
And being next to you, it's like
you make the poem come alive,

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.410
like literally with
-- like [inaudible].

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:36.710
Thank you.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:38.010
And now, you want
to share yours?

00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:39.310
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Yeah.

00:11:39.310 --> 00:11:41.610
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Absolutely.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.350
"Two Guitars" by
Victor Hernandez Cruz.

00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:54.150
Two guitars were left
in a room all alone.

00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:58.020
They sat on different
corners of the parlor.

00:11:58.020 --> 00:12:04.180
In this solitude they
started talking to each other.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:08.280
My strings are tight
and full of tears.

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.830
The man who plays
me has no heart.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.700
I have seen it leave
out of his mouth.

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:15.440
I have seen it melt
out of his eyes.

00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:18.080
It dives into the
pores of the earth.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.910
When they squeeze me tight
I bring down the angels

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.970
who live off the chorus.

00:12:22.970 --> 00:12:28.580
The trios singing loosen organs
with melodious screwdrivers.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:32.220
Sentiment comes off the hinges
because a song is a mountain put

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.250
into words and landscape is the
feeling that enters something

00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:38.010
so big in the harmony.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:42.950
We are always in danger of
blowing up with passion.

00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:50.580
The other guitar --
in 1944 New York,

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:52.450
when the Trio Los
Ponchos started

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:56.790
with Mexican &amp; Puerto Rican
birds, I am the one that one

00:12:56.790 --> 00:13:01.620
of them held tight like a woman.

00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.720
Their throats gardenia gardens.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.770
An airport for dreams.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:11.170
I've been in theaters
and cabarets.

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:13.760
I played in an apartment
on 102nd Street

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:17.060
after a baptism pregnant
with women.

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:22.630
The men flirted and were
offered chicken soup.

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:26.730
Echoes came out of
hallways as if from caves.

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:28.810
Someone is opening the door now.

00:13:28.810 --> 00:13:37.160
The two guitars hushed and
there was a resonance in the air

00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.790
like what is left by the
last chord of a bolero.

00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:44.070
Thank you.

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.140
[ Applause ]

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.440
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora:
And as you start

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.420
with a very simple question,
how did you choose the poems?

00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:57.280
Because my understanding is that
there's a book that you have

00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.670
to -- like a choice
of 160 or so poems,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.320
or what about these two poems

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:05.380
that you just performed
captured you or --

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.040
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: Would you
like to go for first?

00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.340
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
Sure, I'll go first.

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.730
Yeah. So the way we
picked the poems --

00:14:10.730 --> 00:14:15.980
it's a catalog online on the
poetryoutloud.org website.

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:18.840
And there's a bunch of different
ways you can browse it.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.770
You know, there are
some restrictions.

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.000
For example, of the three poems
that you pick, one of them has

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.930
to have been written
before 1900 --

00:14:25.930 --> 00:14:27.230
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Mm-hmm.

00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:28.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
-- and one of them has

00:14:28.530 --> 00:14:30.330
to be less than 25 lines.

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.570
How you distribute those
requirements is up to you.

00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:36.360
You can have one poem fulfill
both of those or you can have,

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.500
you know, two different
poems fulfill two

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:39.800
of those requirements.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:42.860
And then the other one can be
whatever you want it to be --

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:46.150
a really long poem that was
written really recently.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.060
But, basically, though,
there are so many poems

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.700
that it's really hard to pick.

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.000
At least it was for me.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.050
I've done the Poetry Out
Loud competition three years

00:14:55.050 --> 00:15:00.360
in a row, so what I always,
always did was I started

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.840
by just clicking the
Random Poem Button,

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.140
because there is one of those.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.340
And you can just read
a bunch of poems.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.340
And, you know, part of what I
did was the poems that I picked,

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.380
I sort of picked
them strategically,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:16.770
so I would have one
sort of funny one,

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:20.180
usually one really serious,
old one, and then one

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.060
that was kind of, you know --

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.890
had like elements of magical
realism in it that, you know,

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:27.770
parts of it were funny and
parts of it were very serious

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:31.840
and emotional, so "Two Guitars"
was that one for me this year.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:37.780
And also I would try to pick
poems that I felt like I could,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:40.250
you know, put my own voice
into because there are poems

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:43.200
that are wonderful, you know,
in my opinion, that I love,

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.020
but that I wouldn't
want to recite on state.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.800
You know, E.E. Cummings,
for example.

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.650
I love his poetry,
but that's, you know,

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:53.200
it doesn't necessarily translate
to the spoken word as well.

00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.030
So, yeah, that's how I
would pick those poems.

00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.730
The whole ordeal took
me several seeks.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.030
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: And did
they change [inaudible]?

00:15:59.030 --> 00:16:00.470
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Oh,
yeah, oh, yeah, all the time.

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:02.110
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: So you chose
different ones every year

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:03.410
that you competed.

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:04.710
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Every
year that I competed, yeah.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:06.010
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Oh, okay.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:07.310
How about you, Xiadi?

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:08.610
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I mean, the
best way I could describe it --

00:16:08.610 --> 00:16:09.910
both of us started
colleged recently,

00:16:09.910 --> 00:16:13.020
and orientation is throwing

00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:15.960
like a thousand-plus
freshmen together

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:18.300
and forcing them to socialize.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:22.010
And I feel like a poem or poems
for this is a lot like that.

00:16:22.010 --> 00:16:25.320
You meet a lot of different
people the first few days,

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.840
and eventually you develop
relationships with some of them.

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.540
And you learn and understand
them more deeply and sort

00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:33.220
of connect with them
in that way.

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:34.820
So I think the very start,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:36.780
when you start clicking
the Random Poet Button,

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.000
that's sort of the frantic
I know I have to socialize

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.690
but I don't really know what
I'm supposed to do right now.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:43.990
And it only gets
easier from there.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:49.120
And I think a lot of it is
choosing a poem that you feel

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.290
like really speaks to
you and, of course,

00:16:52.290 --> 00:16:54.330
can communicate clearly
on stage.

00:16:54.330 --> 00:16:57.070
But there are some poems
that are very complex

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:58.890
and have a whole
slew of emotions

00:16:58.890 --> 00:17:01.790
that really take your time
and energy to understand.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.370
And I think those poems
are really valuable

00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:07.860
and really the gems
of poetry, all that.

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:09.160
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Thank you.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.460
That's a beautiful metaphor.

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:13.360
And so that was what captured me

00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.220
because as a judge you
-- I learned so much.

00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:20.940
It's like I've read some
of these poems before.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:23.290
But I feel like the
best performances are

00:17:23.290 --> 00:17:27.830
when you really showed
another face

00:17:27.830 --> 00:17:30.320
that I've never really
thought of about the poem.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:37.290
So I was wondering how long did
it take you to find that niche

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:40.190
into the poem and how
long did you practice,

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:44.080
and like who helped
you and, you know?

00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:46.890
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: For me,
it took a lot of time.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:48.680
I don't even know how much time.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.500
But my English teachers
at school helped me a lot,

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:56.260
I think -- the fact that they're
so familiar with a lot of poetry

00:17:56.260 --> 00:17:58.760
and how they have
different visions.

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.450
But I think a huge part
is having multiple people

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:05.810
contribute to how your poem
is interpreted in the end

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.040
because everyone has a
different understanding

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.270
or different life experiences,
and it all changes the way

00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:13.790
that a poem is absorbed
by someone.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.600
So, for instance, the way that
my mom viewed "Degrees of Gray

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.660
in Phillipsburg" was different
than how I wanted to view it.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.260
But sort of interlacing
other people's experiences

00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.560
with your own and trying

00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.390
to understand it more
deeply in that way.

00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:30.300
So my process took a lot of
people and a lot of practicing

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.020
in my room and a lot
of time and effort

00:18:34.020 --> 00:18:35.600
in communication with others.

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:36.900
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Right.

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:39.270
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Yeah, I --
the -practice process, for me --

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:42.790
I sort of, like shamelessly,
asked to practice my poems

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:45.550
in front of anyone who wanted
to hear them [laughter].

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:48.460
You know, in front of my
mom or my dad, who's here,

00:18:48.460 --> 00:18:52.490
and my English Teacher and
Poetry Coach at my high school.

00:18:52.490 --> 00:18:54.630
Here name is Laura
Cowerland [assumed spelling].

00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:55.930
She was absolutely fantastic.

00:18:55.930 --> 00:18:58.290
I met with her once or
twice, you know, every week.

00:18:58.290 --> 00:19:03.900
And in terms of, you
know, the long term sort

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.510
of practice thing -- it's like
once you memorize the lines

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:09.670
and like really get
it to the point

00:19:09.670 --> 00:19:11.730
where like you can recite
the whole poem before you go

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:15.360
to sleep just really quickly
like two guitars, you know.

00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:17.120
That's the easy part, really.

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:18.420
And it's not easy.

00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:20.650
But it's the easy part
because after that,

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:24.040
it's sort of figuring out
not only what the poem means,

00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.070
you know, what these
complicated phrases

00:19:27.070 --> 00:19:30.380
and weird metaphors mean,
but what they mean to you

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.730
as the person who's reciting it,

00:19:31.730 --> 00:19:33.030
because that's what
it's all about.

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:37.000
Poetry Out Load is about, you
know, putting yourself into it

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.280
and realizing what it
means to you and what sort

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.090
of message you want to
convey to the audience.

00:19:43.090 --> 00:19:45.390
And the whole thing
is, you know,

00:19:45.390 --> 00:19:46.780
it's completely subjective.

00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:48.520
People, you know,
like Xiadi was saying,

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.700
they'll interpret one poem
completely differently.

00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:54.960
And one of the more interesting
things that I took away

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:58.280
from my three-year relationship
with this program is

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.810
that often two or three people

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:04.380
or even more will do the same
poem, and it's not boring

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:05.880
when you watch several people
do the same poem in a row,

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.180
because everybody
interprets it differently.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:11.140
There's an infinite amount
of ways to interpret a poem,

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:14.820
and that's what's so
beautiful about it.

00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.320
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: And did
you have a relationship

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:21.300
with poetry before
the program or --

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.690
I know you come from
an acting background.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:24.990
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
Mm-hmm, I do.

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:26.290
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: And do you?

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.590
Because like for
me I remember it.

00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.360
So I graduated high
school in 2008,

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.800
and this program
started like 2006/2005.

00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:34.100
So I actually knew
about the program.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.660
And my English teacher
said, you should do this.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.960
I'm like, no.

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:39.330
I'm so scared of being in front
of people, even though I'm --

00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:41.350
now I'm talking in
front of people.

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:47.240
But what -- if you didn't
come from a acting background,

00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:51.210
or if you did, what
inspired you to take that?

00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.450
For me, it was like that
extra step being a teenager

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:55.910
and being in front of people.

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:59.370
So like what inspired you and
how good poetry helped you?

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.670
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Well, yeah.

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.790
So I acted since
like middle school.

00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.650
I was doing musicals
and plays and stuff.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.600
So I'm generally comfortable
in front of crowds.

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.670
But Poetry Out Loud --

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:11.630
for me it's actually very
different from acting.

00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:14.120
You know, when you deliver a
monolog in front of somebody,

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.790
it's -- you're really -- I
mean, ideally, you're becoming

00:21:17.790 --> 00:21:20.630
that character who's delivering
the monolog in that play.

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.510
You know, you read the whole
play, you sort of figure

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:24.830
out what this character's
all about,

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:27.390
what their motivations are, what
their background is, you know.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.600
You sort of physically
like become that character,

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.550
and emotionally and
mentally and all of that.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.300
But when you're doing the poem,
or when I'm doing the poem,

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.600
I'm not in a different
character.

00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.960
I really am me.

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.480
You know, it's not -- I'm myself
when I'm delivering the poem.

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.210
So that actually makes
it a lot more vulnerable.

00:21:46.210 --> 00:21:49.050
I'm making myself a lot more
vulnerable when I'm doing a poem

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.680
as opposed to when
I'm doing a monolog.

00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.510
And I get a lot more nervous.

00:21:52.510 --> 00:21:57.280
But I did -- you know, there
are obvious similarities

00:21:57.280 --> 00:22:00.190
between acting and
poetry recitation.

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:05.600
And I started Poetry Out Loud
sophomore year, again, at --

00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.050
on my teacher's recommendation.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.090
And, yeah, because they had seen
me act and they had, you know,

00:22:13.090 --> 00:22:14.390
recommended that I do this.

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:15.920
And I was like, yeah,
sure I'll try it.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.790
And I mean, it's been great.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:21.090
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora:
Will you share?

00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.490
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: For me,
my poetry journey sort

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:24.980
of started in second grade.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:26.280
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Wow.

00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.860
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I had a
phenomenal English Teacher

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.710
who really was really
into the poetry unit,

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.010
and [inaudible] communicated

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.310
that really well
to his students.

00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:36.210
And I think that just goes

00:22:36.210 --> 00:22:39.270
to show how important
a good teacher can be

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:43.000
in someone's education and
development, just in life.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.490
But after that I started writing
poetry and reading poetry more

00:22:46.490 --> 00:22:48.770
and more, and having English
Teachers along the way

00:22:48.770 --> 00:22:51.100
who really encouraged
that and inspired me.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.810
And then I went to a high school
called Boston Latin School

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.280
which is very traditional.

00:22:56.280 --> 00:22:57.830
And we have a mandatory
component

00:22:57.830 --> 00:23:00.210
of our English class called
Declenation [assumed spelling]

00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:04.840
which is essentially memorizing
someone else's speech or book

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.430
or monolog and making it
your own and performing that.

00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.590
So that's when my involvement
with public speaking began,

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:14.140
and I didn't learn until my
junior year of high school

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.940
that somehow poetry and
public speaking actually went

00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:18.240
hand-in-hand pretty well.

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.650
And I'm really glad that
there happened to be a program

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.580
at my school and I happened to
discover it even if it was later

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.900
on in my high school period.

00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:26.200
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Wow.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.720
Wow. Well, good job, teachers.

00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:31.200
Keep telling her to do poetry.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:37.030
And what advice do you -- would
you have for like a freshman

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:40.860
or like somebody in middle
school who's thinking

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:44.190
about doing this program?

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:46.350
Like if they've never
heard of it?

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.150
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: My advice --
just like start reading poems.

00:23:50.150 --> 00:23:53.900
I did not get into poetry
as early as Xiadi did.

00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.070
You know, maybe -- there's
this story that I always tell.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.290
When I was in fifth grade there
was this project where we had

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.100
to memorize a poem and recite
it and like write it out

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:05.230
and do a little illustration
that went with it.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:08.650
And I was super happy about
it because I loved poetry.

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:10.190
I hadn't read a lot
of it in fifth grade,

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:13.950
but I recited "The
Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe.

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:17.840
And I got like a two out
of four on the -- well --

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.410
but the reason -- I think
I recited it pretty well,

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:25.600
but the reason was because
I -- when I illustrated it,

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.130
I didn't use color
which was one of the --

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.430
it's heartbreaking [laughter].

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:31.240
But "The Raven."

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:32.540
I mean, that poem isn't --

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.680
that's a black and white
poem to me [laughter].

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.840
But so I did that, and
got a two out of four.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.310
And I was like, I hate English.

00:24:40.310 --> 00:24:42.470
You know, all the way
until like eighth grade

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.780
when I read <i>To Kill a
Mockingbird </i>, and I was like,

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:46.980
oh, my god, I love literature.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.370
So that's when I started
get back into poetry.

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.410
But in terms of advice,
I mean, start early,

00:24:52.410 --> 00:24:55.490
start reading poems, start,
you know, reciting them.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.420
Really fall in love with it.

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.790
Find poems that you
really, really love.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.740
Memorize them, recite them, you
know, to people that you know,

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:08.240
and just, yeah, just immerse
yourself in the whole world

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:11.280
of it because it's a big world.

00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:12.630
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I
completely agree.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:17.600
I think reading is so important
to developing a love for poetry.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:20.270
When you start, there's sort
of like some famous ones

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.820
that you always read, like
Shakespeare's "Sonnets,

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:24.690
and then you think that's
sort of all there is to poetry,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:25.990
and you feel like
you've understood it,

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.290
you've seen it all.

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:29.940
And then, for me, at least,
in my AP Literature class

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:32.520
in 12th grade, my teacher
was really into T.S. Elliott.

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:35.020
And I'd never read
T.S. Elliott before.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.340
And to go from my
understanding of poetry to be

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.560
like Shakespeare's
"Sonnets" and like John Dunne,

00:25:40.560 --> 00:25:42.870
to reading like T.S.
Elliott and "The Love Song

00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:45.950
of J. Alfred Prufrock,"
like that's insane.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:49.120
It's incredible that you can
do all of that in poetry,

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.080
and I never would have learned
that if I didn't keep reading

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.220
and keep exploring and
discovering new authors

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.530
and new styles and new ways

00:25:56.530 --> 00:25:59.850
to communicate the same
emotions over and over again.

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:01.150
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Oh,
T.S. Elliott, huh?

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.020
Because you're a big
fan of that same poem.

00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.320
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Mm-hmm.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.620
"J. Alfred Prufrock," that's
my favorite poem of all time,

00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:06.940
"Love Song of J.
Alfred Prufrock."

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.240
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Wow.

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.510
Could you -- do you know
the beginning of the --

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:12.810
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
Oh, my goodness.

00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:14.110
I recited it last year to --

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:15.410
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Yeah.

00:26:15.410 --> 00:26:16.710
Without putting you on the spot.

00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:18.010
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
[Inaudible] you and I

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:19.310
when the evening
is spread out --

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.610
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: Against
the sky --

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:21.910
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
-- against the sky

00:26:21.910 --> 00:26:23.210
like a patient etherized
upon a table.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:24.510
Woo.

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:25.810
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Oh, yeah.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:27.110
Is that etherized?

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:28.410
Etherized?

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:29.710
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: It means

00:26:29.710 --> 00:26:31.010
that word etherized
-- I'm like, wow.

00:26:31.010 --> 00:26:32.310
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: It's
just like [inaudible].

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.610
It flips you on your -- yeah.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:34.910
It's -- I've never -- that's
the first time that I --

00:26:34.910 --> 00:26:37.660
poetry can do that, oh my god.

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.840
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: And
are you reading now?

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.440
And I know that you're
both starting college,

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.740
so you're both freshmen.

00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:45.940
You just had orientation.

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.240
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Mm-hmm.

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.540
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Are you --

00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.270
when I started writing
I didn't tell people

00:26:50.270 --> 00:26:51.930
that like I did poetry.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:53.340
I was like shy about it.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.640
It was like my own thing.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:58.220
So I wonder if your friends, or
if you're introducing yourself

00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.000
like in -- at college.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.300
Like, you know, I do this.

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.600
I do Poetry Out Loud, you know.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.250
I like recite poetry, or not.

00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:05.550
I don't know.

00:27:05.550 --> 00:27:06.850
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: You
can advertise.

00:27:06.850 --> 00:27:08.150
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: I know.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:09.450
This is what I do.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.750
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I don't.

00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:14.070
I think, for me, poetry
is a very internal thing.

00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:16.270
And even what you said
about being vulnerable --

00:27:16.270 --> 00:27:17.570
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Yeah.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:19.030
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: -- I think
even reciting in front

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.990
of like my parents is
actually pretty hard at times

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.120
because you have to
get into this mindset

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.980
where you really isolate
yourself into this poem.

00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:30.320
So I don't think I'm
thank public about it.

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.970
I don't go around, you
know, just saying --

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.270
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: I'm a poet.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:35.570
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: --
poetry [inaudible].

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.140
But I think for people who do
do that, like that's incredible,

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.490
and we need more people like you

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:42.920
who really emphasize the
effect of poetry on life.

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.220
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Yeah.

00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:45.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
I tell people that.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.820
I go around.

00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.410
I, you know, I, I'm
[inaudible] shameless about it.

00:27:48.410 --> 00:27:50.330
Like I said before,
because it's --

00:27:50.330 --> 00:27:53.460
this is such a big part
of who I am, you know.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:56.700
I would not be the
person I am right now

00:27:56.700 --> 00:27:59.130
if I didn't have
Poetry Out Loud,

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.590
let alone poetry in general.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:04.640
It's such a -- and it should be
a big part of who everybody is

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.940
because it's so important.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.130
It's such an important
way to share, you know,

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:11.020
ideas that can change the world.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.670
And even ideas that
don't change the world,

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:16.340
that just are important to you.

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:18.480
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora:
That was very --

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:25.670
it is about dreaming as well --

00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:28.200
[inaudible] that's why I
read poetry because it's

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.430
like thoughts that
imagine a different world,

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:40.330
and I am interested to hear if
you're still a huge fan -- -

00:28:40.330 --> 00:28:42.250
are you -- what are
you reading right now?

00:28:42.250 --> 00:28:44.270
And it doesn't have
to be poetry,

00:28:44.270 --> 00:28:49.460
but are you still writing, or do
you ever write at the same time

00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:52.900
that you're like
practicing to recite?

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.410
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I
definitely still write.

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:57.480
I think while you immerse
yourself in these poems

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:00.550
for Poetry Out Loud, it's sort
of hard not to be inspired

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:04.190
by them to write and to view
what you've viewed throughout

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:06.180
your life in a very
different way.

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:08.360
And I journal a lot.

00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:11.200
I think journaling is actually
really helpful in terms

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:14.990
of communicating your thoughts
and condensing them and trying

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.330
to see how you can just go
through your day and reflect.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:21.260
But I think, you know,
reciting poetry, reading poetry,

00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:23.800
and writing poetry,
they're all in one category.

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.310
And I think they build off
of each other extremely well.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:28.020
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: I agree.

00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.290
I a lot shyer about my writing.

00:29:30.290 --> 00:29:33.930
I do write, but that's something
I don't generally, you know,

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.810
share poems that I've written
or talked to people about it.

00:29:36.810 --> 00:29:38.860
There was one time that I did.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:43.120
I went on a date with this girl
last summer, and I was just

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.870
like -- it was just -- it was
like -- we went on one date.

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.950
And I wrote [laughter],
I wrote a poem about it.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.900
It was like this passionate love
poem, and I got it published

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.640
in this -- oh, god,
in the school --

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:54.940
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Tell us.

00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:56.240
I can Google it.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.540
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: -- magazine.

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:58.840
No, no, I don't think
you can find it.

00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:00.140
Don't look for it.

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.620
But, yeah, I got it published
it in the school thing,

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.150
and I didn't tell her about it.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.600
And like she read it
and she was like what?

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.350
Because it was the most
embarrassing thing.

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:09.730
It came out like in December and
I'd written it in the summer,

00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:11.960
so it was something
from a long time ago.

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:15.920
So I, yeah, I don't share
my poetry [laughter].

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.040
But I do write, and it
is important to do that.

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:23.680
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: And one last
thing before we close it off

00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:28.850
with you two reading --
reciting one more time.

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:34.400
What do you think
poetry can help us figure

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:37.750
out about the political world
that we're living in right now?

00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:39.870
It's a very difficult question

00:30:39.870 --> 00:30:41.530
and a very difficult time
that we're living in.

00:30:41.530 --> 00:30:46.520
So what, if anything,
did poetry teach you

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:48.640
or not teach you that it can do.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.380
I guess what I'm asking is,

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:57.510
what can poetry do
politically for us right now?

00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:01.050
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: There --
you know, when you watch debates

00:31:01.050 --> 00:31:02.700
and you watch the news,

00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:05.910
it's a lot of people just
saying the same thing over

00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:09.410
and over again to
me on the news.

00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:15.120
And I feel like at a certain
point the only real way

00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:19.860
that you can sort of
convey what's important is

00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:24.230
through something like a poem.

00:31:24.230 --> 00:31:28.140
And that's a difficult thing
to say because I, you know,

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:29.900
I'm not exactly sure --

00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:34.900
sometimes it's a fine line
between like delivering a speech

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:37.190
and delivering a poem.

00:31:37.190 --> 00:31:41.220
But, you know, poems
are all about like --

00:31:41.220 --> 00:31:43.830
they're short, usually, you
know, with the exception

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.410
of "The Love Song of
J. Alfred Prufrock."

00:31:45.410 --> 00:31:47.620
Most poems are pretty short.

00:31:47.620 --> 00:31:51.450
And it's all about
like packing in --

00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.640
a lot of the time
it's about packing

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:58.260
in a really important
message, often political

00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.440
into like a couple of lines.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:08.900
And because of that, because
of how condensed it often is,

00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:12.740
it really hits you like, you
know, like a ton of bricks.

00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:16.130
It is so much more
impactful, to me at least,

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:17.450
than a really long speech.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.050
You know, I can watch
something that's

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:23.090
like an hour-and-a-half
long, and it has a message.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:24.990
And I'm like, yeah,
I agree with that.

00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.110
But if it's something
that's really, really short,

00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:30.560
and it has that same
message, it's like, woo.

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:34.540
And especially today, you
know, in such a polarized

00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:39.870
and often dangerous political
climate, it's really, really,

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:42.770
really important that we all
sort of figure out what it is

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:46.190
that we believe in, and
figure out how to communicate

00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:54.590
that clearly, because, you know,
oftentimes it's, especially now,

00:32:54.590 --> 00:33:00.170
really important to say what you
believe and to put it out there.

00:33:00.170 --> 00:33:02.790
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: I wouldn't have
[inaudible] as beautifully

00:33:02.790 --> 00:33:07.010
as that, but I think empathy
is so important to poetry,

00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:09.730
and I think more than ever it's
also something that we need

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.680
to keep in mind when we're in
a political climate and talking

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.700
to other people with maybe
differing political views,

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.790
but justifications and their
own personal experiences

00:33:18.790 --> 00:33:20.090
to back it up.

00:33:20.090 --> 00:33:23.910
And I think, you know,
poetry - it just tries

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.780
to communicate the
human experience.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:27.750
And I think politics
is also centered

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:29.420
around the human experience.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:31.970
And both of these, if
we don't really try

00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:34.680
to understand ourselves and the
people around us and the people

00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.190
that make up our world, I don't
think it would be valuable

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:39.490
at all.

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:42.580
So I think in that way empathy
is the center of both in trying

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:46.190
to understand what we
need and what we want

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:48.870
in our futures I
think is very similar.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:50.170
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Yeah.

00:33:50.170 --> 00:33:52.400
Well, thank you two
for your thoughts.

00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:55.930
And, hopefully, the
President could think the same

00:33:55.930 --> 00:33:57.820
as you two [laughter].

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:03.020
But do you want to close it
off by reading another poem?

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:04.320
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: Sure.

00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.620
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Yeah, yeah.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.920
&gt;&gt; Xiadi Zhai: Okay.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:20.100
"The Golden Shovel" by Terrance
Hayes After Gwendolyn Brooks.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:32.010
I. 1981. When I am so small,
Da's sock covers my arm.

00:34:32.010 --> 00:34:37.280
We cruise at twilight until
we find the place the real men

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:44.530
lean, bloodshot and
translucent with cool.

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:49.600
His smile is a gold-plated
incantation as we drift by women

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:56.420
on bar stools, with nothing left
in them but approachlessness.

00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:02.110
This is a school
I do not know yet.

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:08.680
But the cue sticks mean we are
rubbed by light, smooth as wood,

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:12.190
the lurk of smoke
thinned to song.

00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:17.000
We won't be out late.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.300
Standing in the middle

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:24.340
of the street last night we
watched the moonlit lawns

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:28.640
and a neighbor strike
his son in the face.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:30.750
A shadow knocked straight.

00:35:30.750 --> 00:35:35.430
Da promised to leave
me everything --

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:43.670
the shovel we used to bury the
dog, the words he loved to sing,

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:51.060
his rusted pistol, his
squeaky Bible, his sin.

00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:57.000
The boy's sneakers
were light on the road.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.400
We watched him run to us
looking wounded and thin.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:06.460
He'd been caught lying or
drinking his father's gin.

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:11.790
He'd been defending his
ma, trying to be a man.

00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:17.870
We stood in the road, and
my father talked about jazz,

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:23.480
how sometimes a tune
is born of outrage.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:29.540
By June the boy would
be locked upstate.

00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:35.070
That night we got down
on our knees in my room.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:37.760
If I should die before I wake.

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:44.910
Da said to me, it
will be too soon.

00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:55.560
II. 1991. Into the
tented city we go,

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.560
weakened by the fire's
ethereal afterglow.

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:02.620
Born lost and cooler
than heartache.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:07.680
What we know is what we know.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.540
The left hand severed and
schooled by cleverness.

00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.240
A plate of weekdays cooking.

00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:17.950
The hour lurking
in the afterglow.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.880
A late-night chant.

00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.970
Into the city we go.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:25.200
Close your eyes and
strike a blow.

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.670
Light can be straightened
by its shadow.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:33.900
What we break is what we hold.

00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:39.010
A singular blue note.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:44.750
An outcry singed
exiting the throat.

00:37:44.750 --> 00:37:51.660
We push until we thin, thinking
we won't creep back again.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:58.400
While God licks his kin, we
sing until our blood is jazz.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.420
We swing from June to June.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:07.870
We sweat to keep from weeping.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:15.480
Groomed on a diet of
hunger, we end too soon.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:17.780
Thank you.

00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:26.320
[ Applause ]

00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:27.620
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Thank you.

00:38:27.620 --> 00:38:29.070
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador:
That was good.

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.370
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Nick?

00:38:30.370 --> 00:38:31.670
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Amador: Yeah.

00:38:31.670 --> 00:38:32.970
Talk about political poems.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:35.270
This is "The New
Colossus" by Emma Lazarus.

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:43.690
Not like the brazen
giant of Greek fame,

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:50.160
with conquering limbs
astride from land to land.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:57.970
Here at our sea-washed, sunset
gates shall stand a mighty woman

00:38:57.970 --> 00:39:02.540
with a torch, whose flame
is the imprisoned lightning,

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:08.190
and her name, Mother of Exiles.

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:13.270
From her beacon-hand
glows worldwide welcome;

00:39:13.270 --> 00:39:16.720
her mild eyes command the
air-bridged harbor the twin

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.910
cities frame.

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:24.290
"Keep ancient lands,
your storied pomp!"

00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:27.720
cries she with silent lips.

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:36.910
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses yearning

00:39:36.910 --> 00:39:42.590
to breathe free, the wretched
refuse of your teeming shore.

00:39:42.590 --> 00:39:50.420
Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tossed to me.

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:56.830
I lift my lamp beside
the golden door!"

00:39:56.830 --> 00:39:59.510
Thank you.

00:39:59.510 --> 00:40:07.080
[ Applause ]

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.650
&gt;&gt; Javier Zamora: Oh, thank
you, Xiadi, and thank you, Nick.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.690
And thank you all for listening.

00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:13.800
And, hopefully, if
you're teachers out there,

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.810
you encourage all your students
to participate in this program

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:22.180
and that you continue to teach
poetry and you continue to read.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:23.480
Thank you very much.
