00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.350
The finish line's in sight
and you put on an extra burst of speed.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.480
As your legs pick up the pace,
your breathing gets deeper,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.021
your heart pounds faster,

00:00:17.021 --> 00:00:20.526
and sweat pours over your skin.

00:00:20.526 --> 00:00:23.162
How does this substance
suddenly materialize

00:00:23.162 --> 00:00:26.460
and what exactly is its purpose?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.782
There are a number of scenarios
that can make us sweat:

00:00:29.782 --> 00:00:30.896
eating spicy foods,

00:00:30.896 --> 00:00:31.871
nervousness,

00:00:31.871 --> 00:00:33.589
and when we're sick.

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:37.892
But exercise is probably the most familiar
and common.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:41.403
In that case, sweating happens 
as a response to movement

00:00:41.403 --> 00:00:43.902
triggered deep inside your cells.

00:00:43.902 --> 00:00:47.093
As you increase your pace,
your muscles work harder,

00:00:47.093 --> 00:00:49.851
increasing their demand for energy.

00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.693
A process called cellular respiration

00:00:52.693 --> 00:00:56.913
consumes glucose 
and oxygen to form ATP,

00:00:56.913 --> 00:01:00.545
the energy currency of the cell.

00:01:00.545 --> 00:01:05.841
Much of this process takes place
in structures called mitochondria.

00:01:05.841 --> 00:01:07.275
The more you move,

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:11.713
the harder mitochondria work
to supply your body with energy.

00:01:11.713 --> 00:01:14.335
All this work comes at a cost, though.

00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:18.568
As the cells break down the ATP,
they release heat.

00:01:18.568 --> 00:01:23.002
The heat stimulates temperature sensors
throughout your body.

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:27.005
Those receptors detect the excess heat
being produced by your muscle cells

00:01:27.005 --> 00:01:30.713
and communicate that information
to the hypothalamus,

00:01:30.713 --> 00:01:32.991
which regulates body temperature.

00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:34.475
The hypothalamus responds

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:37.825
by sending signals out through 
the sympathetic nervous system

00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:40.695
to the sweat glands in your skin.

00:01:40.695 --> 00:01:42.896
These are distributed all over the body

00:01:42.896 --> 00:01:46.786
with especially high concentrations
on the palms of your hands,

00:01:46.786 --> 00:01:48.426
the soles of your feet,

00:01:48.426 --> 00:01:50.025
and on your head.

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:52.845
When a sweat gland first receives
the signal,

00:01:52.845 --> 00:01:56.121
the fluid surrounding the cells
in its coiled base

00:01:56.121 --> 00:01:59.986
contains high amounts 
of sodium and chloride.

00:01:59.986 --> 00:02:03.531
The cells pump these ions
into a hollow tube

00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.176
that runs through the sweat gland.

00:02:06.176 --> 00:02:09.757
Then, because it's saltier inside
the tube than outside,

00:02:09.757 --> 00:02:13.555
water moves into the tube by osmosis.

00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:18.268
As what's called the primary secretion
builds up in the bottom of the tube,

00:02:18.268 --> 00:02:24.057
water pressure pushes it up
into the long straight part of the duct.

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:25.818
Before it seeps onto the skin,

00:02:25.818 --> 00:02:29.968
cells lining the tube will reclaim
as much salt as possible

00:02:29.968 --> 00:02:32.057
so the process can continue.

00:02:32.057 --> 00:02:35.147
The water in sweat absorbs 
your body's heat energy

00:02:35.147 --> 00:02:39.027
and then evaporates off of you
when it reaches the surface,

00:02:39.027 --> 00:02:43.498
which in turn lowers your temperature.

00:02:43.498 --> 00:02:46.494
This process, 
known as evaporative cooling,

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:49.479
was an important adaptation 
for our ancestors.

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:53.199
This cooling effect isn't only helpful
during exercise.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:56.796
We sweat in many other scenarios, too.

00:02:56.796 --> 00:03:02.269
Eating particularly spicy food makes some
people sweat profusely from their faces.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:06.771
That happens because spices trigger
the same neural response in the brain

00:03:06.771 --> 00:03:12.600
that activates temperature receptors,
which usually respond to increased heat.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.935
Sweating is also part of 
the fight or flight response

00:03:15.935 --> 00:03:19.991
stimulated by stressful scenarios,
like asking someone on a date

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:22.290
or interviewing for a job.

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.821
This happens because adrenaline
stimulates muscle activity

00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:28.751
and causes blood vessels to widen,

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:33.481
two responses that increase heat
and trigger the sweating response.

00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:36.780
And sweating also occurs 
when we get sick.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.521
When we're feverish,
we sweat because infections

00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:43.281
stimulate the hypothalamus 
to increase muscle activity,

00:03:43.281 --> 00:03:46.951
which in turn releases 
more energy as heat.

00:03:46.951 --> 00:03:49.021
That increases your overall temperature,

00:03:49.021 --> 00:03:54.482
a protective mechanism that makes your
body less habitable for infectious agents.

00:03:54.482 --> 00:03:58.163
Like with running, sweating helps
your body vent that heat.

00:03:58.163 --> 00:04:00.561
When the fever's over 
or you've won your race,

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:03.960
your temperature receptors 
sense the decrease in heat

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.473
and the hypothalamus brings 
your sweating response to an end.

00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:10.352
In some cases, like after a run,

00:04:10.352 --> 00:04:13.004
the hypothalamus also signals
to your body

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:16.452
that you need to replenish the water
that you've oozed out.

00:04:16.452 --> 00:04:19.411
So, when you're pushing yourself
to reach that next goal,

00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:23.386
you can think of sweat as your body's
very own calibrator,

00:04:23.386 --> 00:04:26.193
enabling you to go that extra mile.
