&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:20.350
[ Applause ]

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.770
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.080
I'm Roswell Encina, the
Chief Communications Officer

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.380
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.940
And welcome to the
Library of Awesome.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.250
I'm not sure if you can tell,
I'm completely nerding out here,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.750
and it doesn't end
there, you know, so.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.280
If you're feeling awesome,
I need all of you to do

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.160
that big Wonder Woman pose.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.300
I know many of you have
seen the movie already,

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.260 position:56%
and I know for 40 years, you've been
watching our special guest tonight.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.500
So I mean, I was not
the only person,

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.990
I'm clearly not the only
person that was twirling

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.910
around when I was a kid, thinking
I was going to turn into, well,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.190
you know, to somebody wonderful.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.240
And I know somebody
here who did it a lot.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.320
So we want to thank you again
for participating here today.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.910
It's a big deal that we
have our special guest here,

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.850
and it's a big deal that our
collection is on display.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.770
If you didn't know,
the Library has one

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.910
of the largest comic book
collections in the world.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.210
So if you haven't seen it yet,

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.260
we have this amazing pop-up exhibit
called the Library of Awesome,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.280
where you'll see a lot
of number one comics,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.840
including the first time
Wonder Woman appeared

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.460
in Sensation Comics by DC.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.870
So it's truly a treat to see.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.780
Also, if it's your first time at
the Library, please, you know,

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.580
feast your eyes to, you know, to
our treasures and the ceiling and,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.650
you know, Instagram it
like crazy because we love

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.480
to see our pictures
all over the place.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.810
Also, I mean, if you're
having fun now,

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.450
there's more fun events
coming to the library.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.070
In a couple of weeks, in mid-July,

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.560
we're starting this first ever
outdoor summer film series.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.840
It starts the second Thursday
of July and it will run

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.910
for six consecutive Thursdays.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.110 position:56%
It's going to be amazing movies that
you'll remember growing up with,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.380
like "Ferris Bueller," "Top
Gun," "Raiders of the Lost Ark,"

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.630 position:56%
and a whole lot more so please make
sure you have your lawn chairs ready

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.020
and we're going to have a great
time this summer at the library.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.510
Now let's talk about
what's happening here today.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.070
We want to thank all the sponsors

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.970
and all the donors who
make this possible.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.000
We can't do what we do without,
of course, without Congress and,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.300
of course, our special donors

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.360
that make all these
amazing programs happen.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:36.090
But let's talk about
Lynda Carter, shall we.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.610
So for 40-something years, I think,
you know, when she first appeared

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.960
on TV, I think all of us
have identified one person

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.260
as Wonder Woman.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.150
So when you think of Wonder
Woman, you think of her.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.820
So in the past 75 years,
Wonder Woman, you know,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.880
she's looking great for being 75.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.570
And we've got a little clip for you

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.000
to show you how she
changed through the years.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.930 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I'm delighted to be
here with you at the United Nations,

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.460
to celebrate Wonder Woman
being named Honorary Ambassador

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.660
for the empowerment
of women and girls.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.110
As you know, I have some
familiarity with Wonder Woman,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.280
and I couldn't think of a
more perfect role for her.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.510
More than 40 years ago, I had
the honor of being cast --

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.510
more than 40 years ago,
more than 40 years ago.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:55.790
[ Laughter and Applause ]

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:02.410
I was cast as Wonder
Woman by Warner Brothers.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.950
This was a momentous
thing for, at the time,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.250
there were very few women holding
their own shows in television.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.570
They didn't think a woman
could hold a television show.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.790
We started getting
letters and phone calls.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.650
I started hearing stories.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.930
This miracle of an idea that came

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.630
from a 48-year-old woman
named Elizabeth started

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.030
to have an influence in some
girls' and women's lives.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.290
That was when Wonder
Woman became flesh.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.190
This idea became a reality.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.860
The she became we.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.950
In some magical and mystical way,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.950
there lies within each
of us Wonder Woman.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.620
She is real.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:08.050
She lives and she breathes.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.410
I know this because she lives in
me and she lives in the stories

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.990
that these women tell
me day in and day out.

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:24.700
I see it in the eyes
that dance before me.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.710
I see it in the letters
and in the stories.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.910
I read it on social media.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.740
I see it in the tears that
fall from the eyes of the women

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.910
who say it saved them from some --

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.380
it inspired them from some
awful thing that they endured

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.120
because they saw -- they saw that
they could do something great.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:01.230
You see, women really
know who they are.

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:09.140
We can be smart and beautiful and
strong and wise and kind and brave.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.800
We believe in fair play and fair
pay and playing by the rules.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.690
We build families and communities.

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:29.890
And, yes, we stand by our
men, as they stand beside us.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:37.060
Wonder Woman helps bring out the
inner-strength every woman has.

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:42.080
We are all inclusive,
that is who women are.

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.410
We are stronger together.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.080
We are half the world.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.760
We have a voice.

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.600
We are the mothers of all mankind.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.550
Your mothers and sisters
and daughters

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.500
and grandmothers and
great grandmothers.

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.410
We are black and brown and
white and red and yellow.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.570
We are tall and short
and thick and thin.

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:08.740
We are blondes and brunettes and
gingers and salt and peppers.

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:16.520
All you women of all colors,
all you children out there,

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.970
never forget Wonder
Woman lives inside you.

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.710
You can be anything.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:26.390
I see these beautiful faces.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:30.040
Learn. Know.

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:35.510

to the Library of Congress.

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:29.650
This crowd is wonderful.

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:33.800
There's also an overflow room too.

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.780
How does this make you feel,
Ms. Carter, after 40 years?

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.080
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Lynda,
please, Lynda.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.840
Can I call you Carla?

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.020
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh,
yes, definitely.

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.560

have to call you doctor?

&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Madame.

00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:05.980
You know, it's really interesting
that after all these years,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:12.920
that Wonder Woman has come full
circle and she's still so relevant.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:23.800
That speech that you saw was given
at the UN and it was for women

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.760
and girls across the world.

00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:33.340
And it was about the
idea of Wonder Woman.

00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:38.190
When I said Wonder Woman is real,

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:44.210
it's the idea of Wonder
Woman that is real.

00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:47.440
Because she does live in us.

00:09:47.440 --> 00:10:00.280
It is the idea of that piece of us
when maybe no one believes in us

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.380
or we've been bullied or someone
thinks we are not tall enough

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:14.680
or pretty enough or good enough
or smart enough or enough, enough.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:20.380
Or we have obstacles to overcome.

00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:24.530
Or we live in a nation that
wants to hide our faces.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:29.960
Or in an area that does
not have good education.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:38.790
Or the skin we live in is
not an easy color to live

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:44.410
in in our neighborhood
or in our country.

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:50.170
I had a singer, one of my
singers, who is an amazing person,

00:10:50.170 --> 00:11:02.450
said to me recently, she said, you
know, Lynda, I can't change this.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:09.210
And living inside this skin
just became harder for me.

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:14.300
What do you say to that?

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:20.130
What do you say to that?

help educate, to help you realize.

You know, I'm an old girl now, but
I will never and until my dying day,

I will never stop fighting
for the idea of Wonder Woman,

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:57.900
the idea of intellect and strength.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.580
Intellect and courage.

about tapping into your
own intellect and courage.

So Lynda, I'm ready to
put on costume and go

00:13:22.390 --> 00:13:24.690
out and do something, okay.

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:29.660
I don't know about you,
but that's what it means.

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:36.440
And even though -- and she's
celebrating her 75th birthday.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.740

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: No, no, no.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:47.940
The comic Wonder Woman
started in 1941.

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:51.500
Did you have any trepidation
when they said,

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:57.400
would you like to embody
Wonder Woman, in the '70s?

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.700

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.530

said, I'm ready?

&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter.

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:07.030
Oh, no. You have to
understand the time now.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:10.340
I was in Hollywood during a time

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:12.790
where there were no
women in television.

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:17.130
They did not think, first of all,
that a woman could hold a series.

00:14:17.130 --> 00:14:21.110
They did not think that women
would tune in to watch an hour long

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:30.040
with a woman as the lead.

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:33.710
They also said, oh,
women are just going

00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:41.370
to hate you, so just get ready.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:42.670
&gt;&gt; Audience: Love you.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.460
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: The
only other woman

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.760
on the set was a script supervisor,

00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:59.460
which is basically the
secretary of the set.

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:10.320
There were -- the stunt
person was a man.

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:12.770
The first time I got on the set

00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:20.350
and this guy had chest
hairs coming out the top.

00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:22.650
Two bullets here.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:26.910
Kind of walking like this.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:33.680
I said -- he said, oh,
the camera's going to be

00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:36.440
so far away, you'll never tell.

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:50.290
I said, I think this and
this, you're going to tell.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.310
And I started, we started,
that show started,

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.350
the Stunt Woman's Association.

00:15:57.350 --> 00:16:00.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, great.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:11.860 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Women have to be
doubled by women from that point on.

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:22.200
And, you know, so this latest
fantastic momentous Wonder Woman is

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.600
directed by my good
friend Patty Jenkins.

00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:31.710
She's a spitfire, oh my god, she's
amazing, and so is Gal Gadot.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:37.040
So if you haven't seen
it, go see it.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.340
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: In fact.

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.640
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I didn't
answer your question.

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.940
Yes, when I got the part.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.240
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You were ready.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.540
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Okay, I was ready.

00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.540
I knew what I wanted
to with the character.

00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:52.250
I knew that if you didn't want to
be her friend, you either wanted

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.450
to be her or be her best friend.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.770
And any guy that looked at
me and was with some girl,

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:04.470
I'd bop him upside the
head and say, get a grip.

00:17:04.470 --> 00:17:06.440
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well,
I have to tell you

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:14.720
that director Patty Jenkins -- see,
we've got a lot of energy up here.

00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:19.950
Because Patty Jenkins tweeted
this week a note from a person

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:21.910
who works at a kindergarten.

00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:25.290
And she talked about the
impact that Wonder Woman had

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.660
on her kindergarten class.

00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:30.360
And I just wanted to share
with everyone part of this.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.260
A boy who was obsessed with
Iron Man had asked his parents

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:41.000
for a new Wonder Woman lunch box.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:47.920
And Ms. Jenkins says, one little
girl said, when I grow up,

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:51.600
I want to speak hundreds
of languages like Dianex.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.260
And another little girl had
her parents revamp her Beauty

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:02.680
and the Beast birthday party in
three days because she simply had

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.390
to have a Wonder Woman party.

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:06.950
And that's the impact.

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:11.710 position:56%
And the note ended from Ms. Jenkins,
consider this your friendly reminder

00:18:11.710 --> 00:18:15.680
that if this movie completely
changed the way these girls

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:19.590
and boys thought about
themselves and the world in a week,

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:22.280
imagine what the next
generation will achieve

00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:25.830
if we give them more
movies like Wonder Woman.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:28.000
What do you think?

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:41.490
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I told Patty
that I was not going to see any --

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:45.340
we've spoken since the day after
it was announced that she was going

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.800
to direct this film,
we spoke the next day.

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:52.300
And we have become great,
great, great friends.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:19:01.550
And I was very free with my
own ideas not about her film

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.780
but about the essence
of the character.

00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.380
I never spoke to the
Gal about her character

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.690
because it's just not something
you do with one actress to another.

00:19:13.690 --> 00:19:20.510
But Gal and I were so in
sync about this character,

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:25.470
I told her that I did not want to
-- I did not watch any trailers.

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:30.880
I did not read any of her
interviews about her process.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.270
I only spoke to her directly.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:40.210
I wanted to go to the premier,
which she invited me to personally.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:43.980
I wanted to go to the
premier uncluttered.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.660
And so I went with my
family, my grown children

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:55.070
and my husband to the premier.

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:59.480
And my heart was pounding.

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:09.840 position:56%
And I was taken because the essence
of who that character is for so many

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:15.970
of us and for so long -- there's
a goodness, there's a heart.

00:20:15.970 --> 00:20:19.370
It's about something.

00:20:19.370 --> 00:20:30.040
It's about who we are as
people, as against the violence.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.170
It's about defending what's right.

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:37.110
It's about being momma
bears, you know.

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.190
It's about those things
that we hold so dear.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:47.120
And so this is great.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.560
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So did
you think about the fact

00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:56.410
that you would inspire
generations of girls and boys

00:20:56.410 --> 00:21:00.670
as you were really
fighting on the set

00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:04.590
and making sure things were
going the way you really thought

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:05.890
they should?

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:07.930
But did you know or
even have a sense?

00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:11.730
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I
really did believe I had

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:17.600
to fight for a lot of things.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.750
They tried to steer me --
they didn't think I was --

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:26.140
they thought I was too
sweet in the beginning.

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.900
And so they tried to
get me to be more,

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.090
you know, assertive with my stuff.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:36.890
And a couple of those
episodes are real stinkers.

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:42.360
They were like, I can't watch them.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:51.420
But when I kind of stuck to my
guns and just really wanted to --

00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:56.180
you know, it's like,
this is who she is.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.970
You know, you're born tall,
you can't make yourself short.

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:02.170
You know, it's just who you are.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.660
You're born with what you're
born with and this are --

00:22:04.660 --> 00:22:09.470
these are the cards you're
dealt and those are her cards.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:14.690
And, you know, this is who we
are as we talked about backstage.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:19.640
Whatever that is and whatever
age we are is what we are.

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.000
I like being a woman.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:34.580
I like looking good, you know.

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.070
Do I like being older?

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:38.510
Well.

00:22:38.510 --> 00:22:39.810
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's
growing on you.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:41.110
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I guess so.

00:22:41.110 --> 00:22:44.960
I can't change it.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.050
So I might as well embrace it.

00:22:47.050 --> 00:22:49.070
You know, it is what it is.

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:51.500 position:56%
And it's not exploitation, you know.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:56.490
It is we're going to do what we do,

00:22:56.490 --> 00:23:03.260
wear the dangly earrings
or not, you know.

00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:06.810
If you like to work
and serve, great.

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.110
It's just who we are.

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:13.530 position:56%
And we're not competing -- we're
certainly not competing against men.

00:23:13.530 --> 00:23:15.660
We love our guys.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.400
We are so thankful.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.280
I'm so thankful for
the men in my life

00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.220 position:56%
that have helped me on this journey.

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:26.760
I embrace every single one of you.

00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:32.330
I embrace every single one of
you who have stood by my side,

00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:39.530
who have helped me when I
was down and I needed a --

00:23:39.530 --> 00:23:42.580
you know, when I went
back to singing --

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.170
someone stole all my
music and all my stuff.

00:23:45.170 --> 00:23:48.120
I was going back on stage and
my son -- I said [crying sound].

00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:54.080
My son, you know, six foot five.

00:23:55.370 --> 00:23:57.640
Mom, look at me.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:10.580
[crying sound] If you go out there
and mess it up, we're still going

00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:15.040
to love you, so, you
know, things like that.

00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:18.850
I mean, you know, these
guys that support us --

00:24:18.850 --> 00:24:21.580
I'm tired of them being
marginalized.

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:23.710
They're not feminists.

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:28.750
We own feminism, you know, we
women own feminism, it's ours.

00:24:28.750 --> 00:24:34.130
You guys are not feminists.

00:24:34.130 --> 00:24:40.480
You support us and we support
you and come along for the ride.

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:46.720
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Now, we
mentioned the new Wonder Woman

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.710
and it's the number
one movie everywhere.

00:24:50.710 --> 00:24:55.200
How that make you feel
when you thought, wow,

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.960
this is -- it lives again.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:06.670
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I told Patty that
-- before I saw the movie, I said,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:12.320
this movie is going to kill,
this movie is going to be great.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.200
She was nervous, you know.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:19.480
There's -- she just made the
best movie she could make,

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:20.890
and that's all we can do.

00:25:20.890 --> 00:25:25.910
Is we go out there and we do
the best damn job we can do.

00:25:25.910 --> 00:25:29.160
And then the rest of it
is just the rest of it.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.120
There are many elements
that we cannot control.

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.830
So she just put every
effort into it.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.970
And she -- you know,
we talked an awful lot.

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:42.270
And she's brilliant.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:45.250
She's a brilliant director.

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:49.390
You know, women can't
make action movies

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:57.410 position:56%
and women don't go to action movies.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:01.040
So, you know, boom, boom, boom.

00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.480
And I said, this is
going to be great.

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:08.470
I said, this movie is going to
gross over a billion dollars.

00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:14.450
There was silence on the other
end of the text, just silence.

00:26:14.450 --> 00:26:21.210
And then after the first
week, the thing came in,

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:22.510
I said, what did I tell you.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:29.490
And she went, yeah, maybe.

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.800
So it's already done like a
half a billion or $600 million.

00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:39.650 position:56%
By the time it's over, it will be --
which is good, because you want it.

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:42.330
You want people to
six and seven times.

00:26:42.330 --> 00:26:46.980
And you want it, because it
just gives her more opportunity

00:26:46.980 --> 00:26:48.700
to do more things.

00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:54.080 position:56%
Because I'm sure she didn't get paid
nearly what other directors have

00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:58.710
been paid for similar kinds of
things, but that's okay, you know.

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:04.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I
think she will now.

00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.700
And if by chance they
asked you about appearing

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.870
in a sequel, would you consider it?

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:22.490
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: You know, she
asked me to do a cameo in this.

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.810
And she was in England, and
I was doing my concerts.

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.410
I went back to singing, it's
really how I started, is a singer.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:37.160
And I was a jazz at Lincoln Center
and I was at the Kennedy Center.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:43.890
And this year I'm finishing
up a new album.

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:48.720
So at that time, I just -- we
couldn't fit -- I couldn't --

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.190
we couldn't get it,
our timing, together.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:59.100 position:56%
And so this next time, if she writes
me a decent part, I might do it.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I think she will.

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.270
Because you have been busy
with your singing career.

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:05.570
You mentioned that.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.690
And I don't know if a
lot of people realize

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:09.890 position:56%
that you had a singing career before

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.410
and now you have a
new album coming out.

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:14.780
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I
do, I have a new album

00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:20.010
and it's really kind of eclectic.

00:28:20.010 --> 00:28:28.860 position:56%
I have quite a few original songs,
which I've been writing a long time.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.790
But this past year,
we were nominated

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:36.600
for best original music
for a video game.

00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.140
And guess what else?

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:54.430
The Library of Congress
is into video games.

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:57.030
Did you know that?

00:28:57.030 --> 00:29:01.220
I mean, this is very
cool stuff, comic books

00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:03.940
and video games, I mean, who knew.

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.940
And I do want to say
one thing, you know,

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:11.120
we're talking about Wonder Woman,
which is all fine and good.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.940 position:56%
But I had the great opportunity to
meet the 13th Librarian of Congress.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.240
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Dr. Billington.

00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:20.540
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Dr. Billington.

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:24.590
We were at a state dinner
and I sat next to him.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:34.470
And when I realized who he was --
his life's work was digitizing,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:39.640
beginning the immense work
of digitizing this library.

00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:46.940
And how he explained it was it's
not just putting things online,

00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:51.340
it is taking the original
work, not copies --

00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:53.260
which is what you see
everywhere else,

00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:57.010
is the copies of the
copies of the copies.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:30:03.750 position:56%
They're quite degraded by the time
you get to try to decipher anything.

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:10.480
So this was high-quality
digitizing of the original work.

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:26.110 position:56%
And I was just -- for a person with
ADD, which I have -- could you tell?

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:32.430
It is just a source -- I went
into the Abigail Adams' letters,

00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:35.080
and then, of course, there's
the little ole blue things.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.050
And you go oh, I want
to see what that is.

00:30:37.050 --> 00:30:39.110
Then you go over here and you go
over here you and you go over here.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.470
And pretty soon I'm over to Abraham
Lincoln and then I'm over here

00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:45.130
and then I'm over in Civil
War and then I'm over --

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:47.810
you know, it's like,
oh, my, it was just --

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:54.140
it is just such a treasure
trove of interesting --

00:30:54.140 --> 00:31:00.740
of learning almost anything that
you could possibly want to know.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:07.330
And seeing these documents
so clearly and paintings

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:12.490
and architecture and
anything that you -- anything.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:16.850
And video games and comic books.

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:21.280
And you can look up Lynda Carter.

00:31:21.280 --> 00:31:24.370
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And
things are going to come up.

00:31:24.370 --> 00:31:27.110
And that's why we call it
the Library of Awesome.

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:30.790
And we're building on that
legacy, Dr. Billington

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:36.030
and even the other Librarians
of Congress since 1802.

00:31:36.030 --> 00:31:37.760
And it's just carrying the baton.

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.320
So we're glad you're here to help.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:42.240
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: There have
only been 14, in the history

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:48.900
of the Library, only
14 Librarians, only 14.

00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:51.000
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And one woman.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:31.880 position:56%
So you can imagine how excited I was
to say, oh, Wonder Woman is coming?

00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:33.180
Oh, sure.

00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.480
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter.

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:37.800
I have to say that what is
interesting about this is

00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:45.800
that this is just -- I
mean, we are half the world.

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.590
As I said, we are half the world.

00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:51.650
We are the mothers of all mankind.

00:32:51.650 --> 00:33:03.990
Hello. This is about -- if
you're thinking of a family,

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:05.750
and you're thinking
-- well, you know,

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:12.310 position:56%
we all agree that raising a family,
you really want to have two parents,

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:14.440
you want to have a
mother and father.

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.850
You want to have a father
and a father and a mother

00:33:16.850 --> 00:33:18.630
and a mother, whatever it is.

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:23.670
But you want to have
coparenting and you want

00:33:23.670 --> 00:33:28.730
to have the yin and the yang.

00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:33.490
Why is it that we think
that's not purposeful

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:38.000
and important in our government?

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:54.110
It's a supportive and another
point of view, you know.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:34:00.760
But women I think are much
less about hierarchy and more

00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:03.440
about community in general.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:05.190
That may be an overstatement.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:10.000
But we don't ask how big is it.

00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:22.560
I couldn't help myself.

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.860
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Lynda.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I couldn't help it.

00:34:34.270 --> 00:34:39.030
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I think it's
time for question and answers.

00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:41.890
Because I've had the
great honor and pleasure.

00:34:41.890 --> 00:34:44.340
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I know, I get
myself in trouble all the time.

00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:47.490
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's
okay, you're Wonder Woman.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:53.510
But I know that I've had the
opportunity to speak with you

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:55.940
and ask you some questions.

00:34:55.940 --> 00:35:00.380
And there's just one before I
open it up and let everybody else.

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.380
Have you had -- I know you've
had down times in your life.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:06.880
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Oh, yeah.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Was there
something that you said to yourself?

00:35:09.890 --> 00:35:18.970
Or how did you channel something to
say, I'm going to just keep going?

00:35:18.970 --> 00:35:20.270
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: People
look at my life --

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.610
I was talking to my niece
who's in the audience.

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:31.260 position:56%
People look at my life and they
say, oh, you know, she's had it all.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:38.810
It's not the truth.

00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.520
It's not where any of us are.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:50.120
It's not what has happened
to any of us.

00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:57.800
Yeah, I've dealt with some really
rough times in my early childhood,

00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.500
in my middle childhood,

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:05.590
in my teenage years,
in my early adult life.

00:36:05.590 --> 00:36:14.040
And worked for every
dime I've ever had.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.830
Graduated high school.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.130
Never went to college.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:27.550
And I had to make a decision --
I actually got a scholarship,

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:33.340
an academic scholarship, to
Arizona State University.

00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:41.820
But I also got an offer to sing
on the road for $600 a week.

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:50.910
Work at a pizza parlor to earn
my way, you know, or, you know --

00:36:50.910 --> 00:36:57.990
I went the singing on the road.

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:02.040 position:56%
And was the girl singer in the band.

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:06.880
And making these decisions
all along the way,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:09.790
where you can go a
lot of different ways.

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:15.170
And I was pretty clear
on what I wanted to do.

00:37:15.170 --> 00:37:16.700
It wasn't easy.

00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:21.940
But there were a lot
harder times than that,

00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.300
where you think everything is --

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:27.510
everything is down,
down, down on you.

00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:31.790
And the world is crashing
in on your soul.

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:40.930
And I think the most
important thing I learned is

00:37:40.930 --> 00:37:48.560
that I didn't have to do it alone.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.650
I thought I did.

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:59.850
I thought I was just -- my
family broke up early in my life.

00:37:59.850 --> 00:38:03.330
And I just kind of, you
know, was out there.

00:38:03.330 --> 00:38:12.360
And I never -- I didn't go asking
for help for advice and help.

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.740
And you need to do that.

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:20.870
You need to ask your
teachers for instruction

00:38:20.870 --> 00:38:25.020
if you're not following your,
you know, you get your homework.

00:38:25.020 --> 00:38:27.670
Sometimes your children are
not doing their homework

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.830
because they don't
know how to do it.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:34.340
They don't know how to
organize themselves.

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.510
Sometimes that's the reason.

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:39.510
Both my children had
learning disabilities.

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:44.810
They had genius IQs, but
they fell off the map,

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.840
one in math and one in reading.

00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:53.380
I was able to figure that
out when they were very small

00:38:53.380 --> 00:39:00.030
and got them some extra help.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:07.960
Because they were so
frustrated and they felt stupid.

00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:16.130
And I'm sure they got that from me,
the ADD bit or the whatever it was.

00:39:16.130 --> 00:39:22.690
And they're both graduated law
school now and very successful.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.390
But we had to retrain their
brains to do a certain thing.

00:39:27.390 --> 00:39:35.260
But getting through it
is part of it, you guys.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:42.170
That's part of it, is step one
foot in front of the other.

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:46.630
Stepping through it helps
to train your brain on how

00:39:46.630 --> 00:39:49.970
to do the next step and
how you do the next step.

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:53.350 position:56%
And I figured if this doesn't work,
then this will, and if this doesn't,

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:56.010
then this will, and if this
doesn't, then this will,

00:39:56.010 --> 00:39:59.130
if this doesn't, then this will.

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.950
And ask for help when you need it.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.160
And I learned that lesson,
and I've been in recovery,

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.510
by the way, for 20 years.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:18.410
[ Applause ]

00:40:18.410 --> 00:40:20.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I'm telling
you, we're going to be fired up

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.620
and ready to go after this.

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:24.190
This is something.

00:40:24.190 --> 00:40:28.850
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: And it's a very
shameful thing, you know, to --

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:31.970
that's a shameful thing
to come to terms with.

00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:36.680
I can do anything, how
can that get me, you know.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.770
How could something
like that get me?

00:40:38.770 --> 00:40:42.000
I didn't even drink till
my mid-20s, you know.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.360
It was just the genetic components
in my body just, you know --

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:55.800
as soon as I started drinking
to get rid of feelings, boom.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.630
And you feel so, so, so ashamed.

00:41:01.630 --> 00:41:04.310
I don't talk about that much,

00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:06.140
but I'm not afraid to
talk about it either.

00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:13.000
You know, that's part
of being a grown-up.

00:41:19.070 --> 00:41:21.070
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: It's also
part of being Wonder Woman.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:24.180
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Yeah.

00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:27.060
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Because what
you have just said and as I said,

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:31.740
we'll be fired up and ready
to go, is that everybody has

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.420
that spirit and that Wonder Woman.

00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:38.250
And you have inspired so
many people for so long.

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.650
And we're just so pleased you
could be here with us today.

00:41:41.650 --> 00:41:48.320
I know I'm going to really --
well, I shouldn't say this.

00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:49.620
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: What?

00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:51.920
Kick butt next week?

00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:56.910
You're wonderful.

00:41:56.910 --> 00:41:58.300
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
thank you so much.

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.970
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: And you know what,
I like that you wear flats, yeah.

00:42:01.970 --> 00:42:03.870
I mean, they're little
kitten heels, I like those.

00:42:03.870 --> 00:42:06.360
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Kitten
heels, that's enough.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:08.420
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Yeah,
I've got my kitten heels

00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.960
in the bag, I'm putting them on.

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.260
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Well,
I had to step it

00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.540
up with you being here,
you must know.

00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:15.840
Had to do it.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.890
So I know and I've been taking
over the whole conversation.

00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:23.050
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: They told me
this is going to be 15 minutes.

00:42:23.050 --> 00:42:24.670
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: See.

00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:28.860
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I
knew they were lying.

00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:30.440
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: So
we have some people

00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:34.170
that are really anxious
to ask some questions.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:39.290
And we have two people, one on
both aisles, with the microphone.

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:44.620
&gt;&gt; I have to gain my
composer right now,

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:48.980
because I'm extremely
excited to be here.

00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:50.670
I just have a comment to tell you.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.690
My son passed away two years ago.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:56.700
He was a Batman fanatic.

00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.530
Graduated high school.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.640
And I obviously am a
Wonder Woman fanatic.

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.680
And the last memory
that I have of him --

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.180
like you said, it brings you
strength that you gave me

00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:11.300
that -- is I went to Starbucks.

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:14.480
And you know Starbucks, you
can be whoever you want to be.

00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:15.780
So one day I'm Lynda.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:17.080
One day I'm Diana.

00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:19.380
And a lot of times,
I'm Wonder Woman.

00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:29.600
And we went into Starbucks
and I had to use the restroom.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.840
And I said -- I ordered his drink
and I ordered my drink, and I said,

00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.820
Wonder Woman and Batman's
drink are coming.

00:43:35.820 --> 00:43:39.400
And he was like, are
you serious, mom?

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.700
I'm like, yeah.

00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:42.970
So when I got out of the
restroom, he had both of our drinks

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:46.320
and it was Wonder Woman and Batman
and it's one of the memories

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.900
and the pictures that I have in
our shadowbox that I made for him.

00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:51.420
And I just wanted to tell
you, thank you so much

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.540
from the bottom of my heart.

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:56.540
I love you so, so much.

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:00.650
I traveled far to be here
just to be this close to you.

00:44:00.650 --> 00:44:02.250
And you inspire me.

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:05.490
You inspire my niece,
my family back home.

00:44:05.490 --> 00:44:07.020
And I just I want to tell you.

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.380
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Oh, come here.

00:44:10.510 --> 00:44:44.410
[ Applause ]

00:44:44.410 --> 00:44:45.710
&gt;&gt; Is this working?

00:44:45.710 --> 00:44:49.650
Yes. I have a two-part question.

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:52.930
First part is lighthearted.

00:44:52.930 --> 00:44:54.580
I know you're an avid rower.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.990 position:56%
And I was wondering if you have been
invisible boat, because I've looked

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:03.920
for you and I can't find you.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:07.150
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I have not
been rowing this year yet.

00:45:07.150 --> 00:45:16.000
But I belong to the Potomac
Boat Club and Thompson's.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:26.500
so I gave my faster rowing
boat to the girls that are

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:31.070
in the Olympic rowing group.

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:34.510
They're rowing for --
practicing for the Olympics.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:35.810
It's a single.

00:45:35.810 --> 00:45:39.080
And anyway, it was too fast for me.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:45.390
And I have my MAAS at Thompson's.

00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:51.060
And as a matter-of-fact, I'm
going to get back on the river.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:52.360
&gt;&gt; Yay.

00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:53.660
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Yeah.

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:57.920
It's called sculling
for those of you --

00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:00.210
you know, it's that
really cool looking thing,

00:46:00.210 --> 00:46:02.170
you know, you see in the Olympics.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:05.810
It's very long and sleek.

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:11.030
And it's tippy, so if you do it
wrong, you boop right in the water.

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:14.700
&gt;&gt; So the second part
is, you look amazing.

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:20.920
So I'm wondering besides rowing
what you do to look so great?

00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:22.330
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Thank you.

00:46:22.330 --> 00:46:24.170
Oh, I love you.

00:46:24.170 --> 00:46:28.750
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: I think
we have another one.

00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:32.610
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I work
on it all the time.

00:46:34.860 --> 00:46:40.880
You have no idea the
pressure, from my daughter.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:49.110
Mom, why aren't you working out?

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:50.410
Hi.

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:51.710
&gt;&gt; Hi.

00:46:51.710 --> 00:46:54.920
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: My daughter the
lawyer who's studying for the bar.

00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:59.850
I said, are you in the bar
or studying for the bar?

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:02.540
&gt;&gt; She's probably both.

00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:03.850
So hi, my name Ada.

00:47:03.850 --> 00:47:07.210
I work across the street this year.

00:47:07.210 --> 00:47:10.180
So in my normal job, I work
for the Department of Defense,

00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.890
where I get to travel all over
helping people and the like so

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:17.570 position:56%
that we can live a better lifestyle.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:22.920
But part of it was traveling to
Iraq and Afghanistan and Jordan.

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:25.850
And I get to interact with women

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:32.690
who don't have the same
opportunities that we do here.

00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:38.000
And I wear Wonder Woman
paraphernalia everywhere go.

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:47.740
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: You're
in the military?

00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:52.910
&gt;&gt; No. They have a
height/weight requirement.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:57.230
No. But in every country I
went, the women would come to me

00:47:57.230 --> 00:48:01.650
and on the side say, I love Wonder
Woman, I want to be Wonder Woman.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:06.750 position:56%
And just thank you, because I always
wanted to be Wonder Woman too.

00:48:06.750 --> 00:48:09.560
And to them, I was helping
them to be Wonder Woman.

00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:11.000
So thank you.

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:22.530
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: You
know, there's --

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:28.060
I really do enjoy hearing the
stories, and I always have.

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:33.940
Many actresses or actors, they
want to divorce themselves

00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:36.270
from a role because,
you know, we are actors,

00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:43.230
we really aren't the
people that we play.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:46.450
But I knew very early
on that, you know,

00:48:46.450 --> 00:48:51.460
that this character is much
more than me certainly.

00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:58.030
And to try to divorce
myself from the experiences

00:48:58.030 --> 00:49:01.520
that other people have of
the character is silly.

00:49:01.520 --> 00:49:06.650
So truthfully -- and my
family experiences it as well.

00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:10.600
The stories that I hear from
people are always so much --

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:16.870
it's so much fun for me to hear and
to look at the glimmer in the eyes

00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:20.420
of parents who tell me about
their children or people who tell

00:49:20.420 --> 00:49:23.960
about their own experiences,
about feelings that they have

00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:28.450
about themselves, or
the little plaques

00:49:28.450 --> 00:49:31.470
that someone has given
them for their work.

00:49:31.470 --> 00:49:33.400
Wonder Woman works here.

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:42.780
The symbolism about overcoming
things, you know, tragedies

00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:46.750
or difficulties or the
admiration that someone has

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:55.220
for a certain woman, this is
all part of the sisterhood.

00:49:55.220 --> 00:50:00.150
It's all part of the
idea of Wonder Woman.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:03.760
And it's you, it's you and me.

00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:08.760
It's you and me and Patty and Gal.

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.140
It's all of us.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:17.050
And that is where some people
miss the boat on this character.

00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:19.190
Yes, it's comic book.

00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:24.750
I mean, we're not stupid.

00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:28.130
But there is something deeper.

00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:39.270
There is something more about this
-- it's not an ideal of a woman,

00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:41.660
it's about her intellect.

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.780
It's about her character.

00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:48.980
And that's what lives in us.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.280
And gave voice to.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:57.180
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: We have
time for one more question.

00:50:57.180 --> 00:50:58.480
&gt;&gt; So I want to thank you so much

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.870
for your career and
your inspiration.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:02.590
Growing up with you was awesome.

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:07.390
And I know your ethnic
heritage is Latino?

00:51:07.390 --> 00:51:08.690
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Uh-huh.

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:11.120
&gt;&gt; And I have my son's
Wonder Woman doll.

00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:13.270
I took it back when he got older.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:20.700
But how did growing up
Latino influence your life?

00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.000
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: I was --

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:28.670
the question is about
growing up in a Latino family.

00:51:28.670 --> 00:51:35.050
My grandmother came over
as an infant from Mexico.

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:39.400
And it was a very rich heritage.

00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:48.930
Those of you who know any kind of
ethnic family, that there's a lot

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:54.940
of food and music and
interactions and all of that.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.320
That's what it meant to me.

00:51:56.320 --> 00:52:06.070 position:56%
And it was a lot of fighting, a lot
of, you know, a lot of tamale making

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:08.850
and menudo making and
tortilla making.

00:52:08.850 --> 00:52:12.860
And it was really wonderful

00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:18.640
and my memories are very
rich in that regard.

00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:22.130
I wish that my own children
had had some of that --

00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:24.990
which they didn't because
we lived on the East Coast.

00:52:24.990 --> 00:52:30.230
But I'm still in touch with many
of my cousins over the years.

00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:39.290
And, you know, I have a
simpatico, I have an understanding

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:45.350
of the immigrant experience.

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:55.780
And I have an understanding
of being with my cousins.

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:05.390
And my mother came
from a family of 10.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:13.630
And in those days in these mining
towns where my grandmother was

00:53:13.630 --> 00:53:18.870
from -- her first husband died in
and the second had darker skin.

00:53:18.870 --> 00:53:21.770
And so the children that
came after had darker skin.

00:53:21.770 --> 00:53:25.570
And so the cousins and that,
so they had darker skin.

00:53:25.570 --> 00:53:32.080
And we would be together,
and I experienced this racism

00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:37.470
and this hatred of
others, the other.

00:53:37.470 --> 00:53:42.610
And it was so confusing to me.

00:53:42.610 --> 00:53:46.590
It was so unfair.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:52.580
It was -- my grandmother had
asked me to take something,

00:53:52.580 --> 00:53:56.280
return something, at the store.

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:58.630
And I said, why doesn't he do it?

00:53:58.630 --> 00:54:00.900
And she would say, because
they won't take it from him.

00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:06.720
I would take it back and
they would take it from me.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:13.890
But they wouldn't take the return
from the darker skinned cousin.

00:54:13.890 --> 00:54:21.990
And, you know, it hurts
you in a place that --

00:54:21.990 --> 00:54:27.110
you know, it hurts
you in some raw place

00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:30.800
that unless you've experienced
it, you don't understand.

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:36.330
Now, personally, did I experience
-- my children are Jewish.

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:46.720
So how far -- how many steps
removed are we from the pogroms

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:52.230
of Europe and, you know, people
yanking people off the streets

00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:56.410
like is happening with
ISIS right now.

00:54:56.410 --> 00:55:00.300
It's scary stuff.

00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:04.870
So anyway, that is my
Latino experience and most

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:10.080
of it is absolutely brilliant
and I loved it, I loved --

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.280
that's what I take from it is
a great amount of understanding

00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:25.510
and love for hard-working
immigrant families.

they told you 15 minutes,

and we have kept you a lot longer.

never said 15 minutes,

we just wanted to give you something

comes from us with deep gratitude.

to give you something first?

where's the other thing?

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, there's more?

00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:09.480

get some more stuff on our side.

is -- where's my little note?

&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: And everyone
is seeing me accept this

00:56:43.570 --> 00:56:50.160
for the Library, right?

00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:53.640
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: And this
is an original illustration

00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:58.420
by the artist Cat Skaggs, one
of the contributing artists

00:56:58.420 --> 00:56:59.990
of the comic book series.

00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:05.740
She created this piece of art
specifically for this event.

00:57:05.740 --> 00:57:09.860
And it's one-of-a-kind and
it will not be reproduced

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:13.780
from the DC Comic War.

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.840
I want it.

00:57:15.840 --> 00:57:17.640
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: You do?

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:31.040
[ Applause ]

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:34.810
Don't worry, you won't
see this in my office.

00:57:36.030 --> 00:57:37.730
Boy. There's more?

00:57:37.730 --> 00:57:39.900
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: This is
very cool, this is so cool,

00:57:39.900 --> 00:57:43.720
you just cannot believe
how cool this is.

00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.020
From the director Patty Jenkins.

00:57:52.050 --> 00:57:56.060
To Dr. Hayden and friends
of the Library of Congress,

00:57:56.060 --> 00:58:01.160 position:56%
on behalf of all of us who made this
film, Warner Brothers and DC Comics,

00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:05.710
we are so incredibly
honored to have a copy

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:15.260
of our script presented here today.

00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:21.180
Both comic books superheroes
and the art form of cinema,

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:26.440
for all our uniquely successful
American -- American --

00:58:26.440 --> 00:58:32.610 position:56%
phenomenas that can at times
symbolize the best the United States

00:58:32.610 --> 00:58:38.450
of America has to offer.

00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:44.350
With this film, we aspired to
live up to the highest hopes

00:58:44.350 --> 00:58:47.130
and ideals of both art forms.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:53.440
So it is a particular honor
to have this housed here among

00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.090
so many other great
treasures of our great nation.

00:58:57.090 --> 00:59:01.680
I truly wish that I could be
there to stand side-by-side

00:59:01.680 --> 00:59:12.350
with the great ambassador
of all things Wonder Woman.

00:59:12.350 --> 00:59:15.430
But we are all there inspirit
and wish you great success

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:19.040

00:59:38.710 --> 00:59:40.140
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: Isn't that great?

00:59:40.140 --> 00:59:41.440
&gt;&gt; Carla Hayden: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:46.600
&gt;&gt; Lynda Carter: And it
truly is a thrill for --

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:52.310
when I first contacted them
-- Patty wanted to be here.

00:59:52.310 --> 01:00:00.600
When I first contacted her to
do this, they were so thrilled

01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:03.350
because of this great institution.

And there is no other library
of its kind in the world.

01:01:05.290 --> 01:01:12.790
Truly, truly there is no other
library of its kind in the world.

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:20.230
And its steward is the first
woman, the first woman of color,

01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:26.510
