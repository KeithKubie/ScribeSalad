00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.350
 
yeah well human-made global warming is

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360
yeah well human-made global warming is
 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.839
yeah well human-made global warming is
caused by changes in the atmosphere

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:20.849
caused by changes in the atmosphere
 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.570
caused by changes in the atmosphere
which are due to burning fossil fuels

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580
which are due to burning fossil fuels
 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.040
which are due to burning fossil fuels
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal
 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.990
primarily as we burn oil gas and coal
this releases carbon dioxide to the

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
this releases carbon dioxide to the
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.290
this releases carbon dioxide to the
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs
 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660
atmosphere and carbon dioxide absorbs
heat radiation from the earth and that

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670
heat radiation from the earth and that
 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.330
heat radiation from the earth and that
traps the heat radiation and makes the

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340
traps the heat radiation and makes the
 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.240
traps the heat radiation and makes the
planet a bit warmer so we notice that

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250
planet a bit warmer so we notice that
 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.310
planet a bit warmer so we notice that
the world has warmed up about one and a

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320
the world has warmed up about one and a
 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.590
the world has warmed up about one and a
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.020
half degrees Fahrenheit in the last
century with most of that warming in the

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
century with most of that warming in the
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.940
century with most of that warming in the
last 30 years

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.890
 
there's now 387 parts per million of co2

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:57.900
there's now 387 parts per million of co2
 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.900
there's now 387 parts per million of co2
in the atmosphere 150 years ago it was

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910
in the atmosphere 150 years ago it was
 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.500
in the atmosphere 150 years ago it was
280 so it's increased by a hundred and

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510
280 so it's increased by a hundred and
 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.570
280 so it's increased by a hundred and
seven ppm what we thought a few years

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
seven ppm what we thought a few years
 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.810
seven ppm what we thought a few years
ago was that it would probably be safe

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820
ago was that it would probably be safe
 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.410
ago was that it would probably be safe
to let co2 go as high as 450 parts per

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420
to let co2 go as high as 450 parts per
 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.140
to let co2 go as high as 450 parts per
million the reason we thought that was

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150
million the reason we thought that was
 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.180
million the reason we thought that was
that we know that there were previous

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190
that we know that there were previous
 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.609
that we know that there were previous
periods in the Earth's history called

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
periods in the Earth's history called
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.700
periods in the Earth's history called
interglacial periods we're now in a warm

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710
interglacial periods we're now in a warm
 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.249
interglacial periods we're now in a warm
interglacial period which we have been

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259
interglacial period which we have been
 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190
interglacial period which we have been
in for about 12,000 years but there were

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200
in for about 12,000 years but there were
 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.950
in for about 12,000 years but there were
prior periods when the earth was warmer

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960
prior periods when the earth was warmer
 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140
prior periods when the earth was warmer
than it is now and the planet was still

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
than it is now and the planet was still
 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.310
than it is now and the planet was still
pretty much the way it is now

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320
pretty much the way it is now
 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.050
pretty much the way it is now
and we thought that it was then about a

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
and we thought that it was then about a
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.389
and we thought that it was then about a
degree or so Celsius which is about two

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399
degree or so Celsius which is about two
 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.420
degree or so Celsius which is about two
degrees fahrenheit warmer than it is now

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430
degrees fahrenheit warmer than it is now
 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.940
degrees fahrenheit warmer than it is now
and we thought that might be okay to be

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
and we thought that might be okay to be
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.940
and we thought that might be okay to be
that warm and 450 parts per million

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950
that warm and 450 parts per million
 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.070
that warm and 450 parts per million
would probably take us to that sort of a

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080
would probably take us to that sort of a
 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.700
would probably take us to that sort of a
climate but what we now realize is that

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
climate but what we now realize is that
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.999
climate but what we now realize is that
during those prior warm periods sea

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009
during those prior warm periods sea
 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.800
during those prior warm periods sea
level was about six or seven meters

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810
level was about six or seven meters
 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.010
level was about six or seven meters
higher than it is now and also we see

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020
higher than it is now and also we see
 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.800
higher than it is now and also we see
what's happening with the current 387

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810
what's happening with the current 387
 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.500
what's happening with the current 387
parts per million that's already enough

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
parts per million that's already enough
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.809
parts per million that's already enough
that the Arctic sea ice is melting

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819
that the Arctic sea ice is melting
 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.090
that the Arctic sea ice is melting
mountain glaciers all around the world

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100
mountain glaciers all around the world
 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.100
mountain glaciers all around the world
are melting which is going to affect the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
are melting which is going to affect the
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.820
are melting which is going to affect the
freshwater supply for billions of people

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830
freshwater supply for billions of people
 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.850
freshwater supply for billions of people
the climate zones are shifting so the

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860
the climate zones are shifting so the
 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.830
the climate zones are shifting so the
Southwest United States and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840
Southwest United States and
 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.839
Southwest United States and
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter
 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:36.740
Mediterranean region are becoming hotter
and drier

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
and drier
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.110
and drier
likewise Australia so you see increased

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120
likewise Australia so you see increased
 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.320
likewise Australia so you see increased
forest fires and reduced water supplies

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330
forest fires and reduced water supplies
 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.620
forest fires and reduced water supplies
in those regions coral reefs are already

in those regions coral reefs are already
 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.530
in those regions coral reefs are already
under stress they're going to many of

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540
under stress they're going to many of
 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.720
under stress they're going to many of
them are going to be lost if we continue

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730
them are going to be lost if we continue
 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.570
them are going to be lost if we continue
with increasing greenhouse gases so we

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580
with increasing greenhouse gases so we
 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.690
with increasing greenhouse gases so we
realize already the 387 is actually too

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
realize already the 387 is actually too
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.559
realize already the 387 is actually too
large about 350 parts per million is a

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569
large about 350 parts per million is a
 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.080
large about 350 parts per million is a
more realistic target and that means

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090
more realistic target and that means
 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.320
more realistic target and that means
we're going to have to phase out you

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330
we're going to have to phase out you
 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420
we're going to have to phase out you
of coal over the next couple of decades

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430
of coal over the next couple of decades

of coal over the next couple of decades
if we want to be able to get back to 350

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.210
if we want to be able to get back to 350
 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:18.040
if we want to be able to get back to 350
parts per million

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.140
 
look at the fossil fuels we see how much

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150
look at the fossil fuels we see how much
 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.010
look at the fossil fuels we see how much
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and
 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.980
carbon there is in oil gas and coal and
by far the largest is coal and we know

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990
by far the largest is coal and we know
 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:28.450
by far the largest is coal and we know
that we're going to use the oil in the

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460
that we're going to use the oil in the
 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.490
that we're going to use the oil in the
gas it's very they're very convenient

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500
gas it's very they're very convenient
 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.610
gas it's very they're very convenient
fuels the big pools are owned by Russia

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620
fuels the big pools are owned by Russia
 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.680
fuels the big pools are owned by Russia
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going
 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.640
and Saudi Arabia they're certainly going
to sell that gas in oil if we want to be

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650
to sell that gas in oil if we want to be
 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.710
to sell that gas in oil if we want to be
able to get back to 350 parts per

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720
able to get back to 350 parts per
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.120
able to get back to 350 parts per
million it's this huge coal reserves

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130
million it's this huge coal reserves
 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.220
million it's this huge coal reserves
that we're going to have to leave in the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230
that we're going to have to leave in the
 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.620
that we're going to have to leave in the
ground or we could burn the coal and

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630
ground or we could burn the coal and
 

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.570
ground or we could burn the coal and
capture the co2 and put it back in the

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580
capture the co2 and put it back in the
 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.700
capture the co2 and put it back in the
ground but that's very difficult we're

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:54.710
ground but that's very difficult we're
 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.270
ground but that's very difficult we're
gonna have to move beyond fossil fuels

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
gonna have to move beyond fossil fuels
 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.830
gonna have to move beyond fossil fuels
sometime within the next century anyway

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840
sometime within the next century anyway
 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.010
sometime within the next century anyway
so why not do it now and preserve a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020
so why not do it now and preserve a
 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.200
so why not do it now and preserve a
climate that will allow our children and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:05.210
climate that will allow our children and
 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.210
climate that will allow our children and
grandchildren to have the same sort of

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220
grandchildren to have the same sort of
 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:09.970
grandchildren to have the same sort of
planet that we enjoy and with all of the

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.960
 
huge step and that is putting a price on

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970
huge step and that is putting a price on
 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.260
huge step and that is putting a price on
carbon emissions it's it's really that

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270
carbon emissions it's it's really that
 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.740
carbon emissions it's it's really that
simple if we put a gradually increasing

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750
simple if we put a gradually increasing
 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.710
simple if we put a gradually increasing
price on carbon emissions by putting a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720
price on carbon emissions by putting a
 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.790
price on carbon emissions by putting a
tax at the source at the mine or at the

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:33.800
tax at the source at the mine or at the
 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.160

excited about this issue the way they
 

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:37.000
excited about this issue the way they
were about health care but we need to

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:37.010
were about health care but we need to
 

00:13:37.010 --> 00:13:40.290
were about health care but we need to
have that kind of an an open discussion

00:13:40.290 --> 00:13:40.300
have that kind of an an open discussion
 

00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:43.180
have that kind of an an open discussion
so that we see what the alternatives are

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:43.190
so that we see what the alternatives are
 

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:45.520
so that we see what the alternatives are
because this approach that is being

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:45.530
because this approach that is being
 

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.790
because this approach that is being
pushed by the Democratic Party is a

00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800
pushed by the Democratic Party is a
 

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.700
pushed by the Democratic Party is a
disaster

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:52.710
 
 

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:55.350
 
activism is going to be necessary it

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:55.360
activism is going to be necessary it
 

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.960
activism is going to be necessary it
seems so we have to draw attention to

00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:57.970
seems so we have to draw attention to
 

00:13:57.970 --> 00:14:00.930
seems so we have to draw attention to
the intergenerational injustice in

00:14:00.930 --> 00:14:00.940
the intergenerational injustice in
 

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:03.450
the intergenerational injustice in
climate change you know I went to

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:03.460
climate change you know I went to
 

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.970
climate change you know I went to
Massachusetts because I recognized that

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:05.980
Massachusetts because I recognized that
 

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.670
Massachusetts because I recognized that
they're very progressive state and I had

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:08.680
they're very progressive state and I had
 

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.460
they're very progressive state and I had
hoped that you know we have to find one

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:11.470
hoped that you know we have to find one
 

00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:16.080
hoped that you know we have to find one
state that will take an approach that

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:16.090
state that will take an approach that
 

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:20.640
state that will take an approach that
works and that means a carbon price with

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:20.650
works and that means a carbon price with
 

00:14:20.650 --> 00:14:22.850
works and that means a carbon price with
the money a hundred percent of the money

province in Canada that's doing that but

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:29.320
province in Canada that's doing that but
 

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.020
province in Canada that's doing that but
people in the United States don't pay

00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:31.030
people in the United States don't pay
 

00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.580
people in the United States don't pay
that much attention to what's happening

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:32.590
that much attention to what's happening
 

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.640
that much attention to what's happening
in British Columbia Canada if we had one

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:35.650

state that would pass a law with a

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:39.930
state that would pass a law with a

dividend to the public then I think

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:44.500
dividend to the public then I think
 

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:46.110
dividend to the public then I think
people would wake up and say and they

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:46.120
people would wake up and say and they
 

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.970
people would wake up and say and they
would say hey this works and it's to the

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:47.980
would say hey this works and it's to the
 

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.280
would say hey this works and it's to the
advantage of the public not to the

cap-and-trade so getting them to change

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260

is a good example but again I think they

try to make clear what the implications
 

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.630

are and I certainly have every right to

are and I certainly have every right to

do that and I think that scientific
 

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.320
do that and I think that scientific

recognizes this is an issue where we
 

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:36.240
recognizes this is an issue where we
have to educate the public

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:39.390
 
well if we if we allow emissions to

well if we if we allow emissions to
continue at a high rate then this

for us to hope that we could transplant
life from our planet to another planet

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:17.530
life from our planet to another planet
 

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:22.740
life from our planet to another planet
is really unrealistic

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:22.750
 
 

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:25.830
 
fact means once the planet gets warmer

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:25.840
fact means once the planet gets warmer
 

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:27.810
fact means once the planet gets warmer
and warmer then the oceans begin to

00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:27.820
and warmer then the oceans begin to
 

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:30.300
and warmer then the oceans begin to
evaporate and water vapor is a very

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:30.310
evaporate and water vapor is a very
 

00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:32.580
evaporate and water vapor is a very
strong greenhouse gas even more powerful

00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:32.590
strong greenhouse gas even more powerful
 

00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:34.860
strong greenhouse gas even more powerful
than carbon dioxide so you can get to a

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:34.870
than carbon dioxide so you can get to a
 

00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:38.220
than carbon dioxide so you can get to a
situation where it just the oceans will

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:38.230
situation where it just the oceans will
 

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:41.850
situation where it just the oceans will
begin to boil and the planet becomes so

00:18:41.850 --> 00:18:41.860
begin to boil and the planet becomes so
 

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:43.530
begin to boil and the planet becomes so
hot that the ocean ends up in the

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:43.540
hot that the ocean ends up in the
 

00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:45.360
hot that the ocean ends up in the
atmosphere and that happened to Venus

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:45.370
atmosphere and that happened to Venus
 

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:49.440
atmosphere and that happened to Venus
you know that's why Venus no longer has

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:49.450
you know that's why Venus no longer has
 

00:18:49.450 --> 00:18:51.450
you know that's why Venus no longer has
carbon in its surface

00:18:51.450 --> 00:18:51.460
carbon in its surface
 

00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:54.510
carbon in its surface
it's its atmosphere is made up basically

00:18:54.510 --> 00:18:54.520
it's its atmosphere is made up basically
 

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.370
it's its atmosphere is made up basically
of carbon dioxide because it had a

00:18:56.370 --> 00:18:56.380
of carbon dioxide because it had a
 

00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:00.290
of carbon dioxide because it had a
runaway greenhouse effect now the earth

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:00.300
runaway greenhouse effect now the earth
 

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:03.540
runaway greenhouse effect now the earth
it can go unstable either toward a cold

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:03.550
it can go unstable either toward a cold
 

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.740
it can go unstable either toward a cold
climate or toward a hot climate and the

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:07.750
climate or toward a hot climate and the
 

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.110
climate or toward a hot climate and the
earth has had a runaway snowball earth

00:19:12.110 --> 00:19:12.120
earth has had a runaway snowball earth
 

00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:14.010
earth has had a runaway snowball earth
situation this happened the most

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:14.020
situation this happened the most
 

00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:17.790
situation this happened the most
recently about 700 million years ago the

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:17.800
recently about 700 million years ago the
 

00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.310
recently about 700 million years ago the
earth froze all the way to the equator

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:20.320
earth froze all the way to the equator
 

00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:23.010
earth froze all the way to the equator
so these runaway situations can occur

00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:23.020
so these runaway situations can occur
 

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.170
so these runaway situations can occur
we've never had a runaway greenhouse

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.180
we've never had a runaway greenhouse
 

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.480
we've never had a runaway greenhouse
effect because if we did that would have

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:27.490
effect because if we did that would have
 

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:28.830
effect because if we did that would have
been the end once that's a permanent

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840
been the end once that's a permanent
 

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.860
been the end once that's a permanent
situation in the case of a snowball

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:31.870
situation in the case of a snowball
 

00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:36.540
situation in the case of a snowball
earth when the earth becomes ice-covered

00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:36.550
earth when the earth becomes ice-covered
 

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.110
earth when the earth becomes ice-covered
then the planet can escape from that

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120
then the planet can escape from that
 

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.690
then the planet can escape from that
situation because volcanoes continue to

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:42.700
situation because volcanoes continue to
 

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:45.350
situation because volcanoes continue to
go off but the weathering process is

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:45.360
go off but the weathering process is
 

00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.100
go off but the weathering process is
greatly reduced

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:47.110
greatly reduced
 

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:49.740
greatly reduced
so volcanoes put carbon dioxide into the

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:49.750
so volcanoes put carbon dioxide into the
 

00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.080
so volcanoes put carbon dioxide into the
atmosphere and it builds up more and

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:52.090
atmosphere and it builds up more and
 

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.540
atmosphere and it builds up more and
more until there's enough to melt the

00:19:54.540 --> 00:19:54.550
more until there's enough to melt the
 

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.470
more until there's enough to melt the
ice but we can't push the planet off of

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:58.480
ice but we can't push the planet off of
 

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.020
ice but we can't push the planet off of
the runaway greenhouse end that's that's

00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:01.030
the runaway greenhouse end that's that's
 

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:06.460
the runaway greenhouse end that's that's
the end for everybody if we do that

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:06.470
 
 

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.750
 
first of all you'd have to melt the ice

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:07.760
first of all you'd have to melt the ice
 

00:20:07.760 --> 00:20:10.500
first of all you'd have to melt the ice
sheets and that takes a while

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:10.510
sheets and that takes a while
 

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:12.640
sheets and that takes a while
Antarctic ice sheet is a couple miles

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:12.650
Antarctic ice sheet is a couple miles
 

00:20:12.650 --> 00:20:18.820
Antarctic ice sheet is a couple miles
thick but with continued rapid increase

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:18.830
thick but with continued rapid increase
 

00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:24.399
thick but with continued rapid increase
in greenhouse gases that you could melt

00:20:24.399 --> 00:20:24.409
in greenhouse gases that you could melt
 

00:20:24.409 --> 00:20:27.010
in greenhouse gases that you could melt
the ice sheets in less than a century

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:27.020
the ice sheets in less than a century
 

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:30.039
the ice sheets in less than a century
and then things started to get hotter

00:20:30.039 --> 00:20:30.049
and then things started to get hotter
 

00:20:30.049 --> 00:20:31.450
and then things started to get hotter
and hotter so over a period of several

00:20:31.450 --> 00:20:31.460
and hotter so over a period of several
 

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:34.299
and hotter so over a period of several
centuries it would be conceivable to

00:20:34.299 --> 00:20:34.309
centuries it would be conceivable to
 

00:20:34.309 --> 00:20:35.919
centuries it would be conceivable to
have a runaway greenhouse that would

00:20:35.919 --> 00:20:35.929
have a runaway greenhouse that would
 

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:38.620
have a runaway greenhouse that would
also require bringing into play what we

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:38.630
also require bringing into play what we

hydrates we already observe in the
 

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:48.820
hydrates we already observe in the
tundra region in Canada and Siberia that

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:48.830
tundra region in Canada and Siberia that
 

00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:52.360
tundra region in Canada and Siberia that
as the tundra is melting methane frozen

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:52.370
as the tundra is melting methane frozen
 

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.340
as the tundra is melting methane frozen
methane begins to be released and

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:54.350
methane begins to be released and
 

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:56.860
methane begins to be released and
methane is another powerful greenhouse

00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:56.870
methane is another powerful greenhouse
 

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.799
methane is another powerful greenhouse
gas and there have been times in the

gas and there have been times in the
 

00:20:59.809 --> 00:21:02.740

hydrates on the continental shelves
melted and went into the atmosphere and
