&gt;&gt;Female presenter: I'm really happy to introduce
Rich DeMillo who's the Distinguished Professor

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.880
of Computing and Professor of Management,
the former John. P. Imlay Dean of Computing,

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.330
and the director of the new Center for 21st
Century universities at Georgia Tech. , Previously,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.121
he had academic positions at Purdue, University
of Wisconsin, and University of Padua. He

00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:28.410
directed the Computer and Computation Research
Division of NSF. And was Hewlett Packard's

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.190
first CTO. The author of over 100 articles
and books, he's here to talk today about his

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:41.820
new book Abelard to Apple. Thanks so much
for coming here, Rich.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.820
[Applause]

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:52.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for
coming. I want to talk to you about what I'm

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:01.560
thinking of as the fate -- future fate of
American higher education. I'm sort of an

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.390
unlikely person to write a book about university.
If you think about the famous books about

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.369
higher education, they're usually written
by college presidents. The college presidents

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.380
leave and write a memoir of their experience.
Sometimes they're written by people who do

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.470
research in education so they present original
research results. Policy people, economists

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:34.229
who have kind of deep things to say about
education. And of course, I'm none of those.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.090
And to be honest, I didn't set out to write
this book. When I stepped down as dean in

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:53.579
2009, I really had a very different book in
mind. I was going to write a book about innovation.

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.090
Because they're just aren't enough books out
there about innovation. And unfortunately,

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.579
I was saved from that fate. When I did step
down, I decided to write as a lot of deans

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.340
do a valedictory. So I wanted to summarize
in four or five pages things I had learned

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:22.610
as a dean to hand off to my boss and my fellow
deans at Georgia Tech So I wrote this four

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:28.780
or five page little thing and circulated it
and started to get questions from people.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.730
I don't know that or I didn't believe that.
So grumble, grumble. I'd go back and expand

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.220
on something I had said and pretty soon my
little 5-page memo, was a 10-page memo, then

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.640
a 15-page memo, then 100 page memo and at
some point I decided to stop because I was

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:53.710
just tired about writing about being a dean.
And happened to make a trip to see my editor

00:02:53.710 --> 00:03:02.451
at MIT press for my innovation book. And she
happened to ask over lunch so what else are

00:03:02.451 --> 00:03:08.060
you working on? And I said, "well, really
nothing, except I've got this 100-page thing

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.060
that I don't know what to do with." And she
said oh, what's it about. And I said it's

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:21.290
about why college costs so much, why the outcomes
are so bad, why universities are slow to change.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.780
And she said oh, well, that's really interesting,
because that's the number one thing we hear

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:38.460
about these days as an opportunity for books.
So I quite wisely dropped by book on innovation

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.820
and spent the next year putting together this
book on the future of universities. And I

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:53.480
was a little ways into the project. I sort
of anticipated this book to be a book written

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.670
by a professor for other professors and I
was a little ways into the project and was

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.340
at a social gathering and someone said, "oh,
what are you working on" and I told this story.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.800
And they said, "well give me an example",
so I gave some examples. Eyes glazed over.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.540
Not because they were â€“ well, they were
probably bored with the conversation, but

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.190
they had no idea what I was talking about.
And these were people that were on my advisory

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.510
board, that had advanced degrees from Georgia
Tech and Carnegie Mellon and MIT. They just

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:32.410
had no idea what this conversation was all
about. So a couple months into writing the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:40.040
book, I made a right turn and the right turn
was to stop writing a book for people in academia

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.220
and start writing a book for my friends. So,
the book I'm going to talk to you about today

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.760
is really a book that was intended to be a
conversation starter for everyone else in

00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:01.630
the world who's not deeply involved in the
minutia and processes of higher education.

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.500
And you know, we'll talk along the ways about
some of the things that people are concerned

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.380
about. I guess the first thing to do is explain
the title of the book. Abelard to Apple. First

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.810
of all, why Apple? Well, I searched really
hard for a medieval scholar that began with

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:31.360
G or Y. And sorry there aren't any. There
are barely any with M. But there are a lot

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:39.910
with A. Anselm, Aquinas. Peter Abelard, who
it turns out, has an interesting story independent

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:47.930
of the history of western universities. So
Peter Abelard was an 11th century French monk.

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:55.050
And he's mainly known for his unfortunate
love affair with a woman named Heloise. It

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:02.450
ended badly for both of them. That's how most
people know about Peter Abelard. I'm the product

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.470
of a Catholic liberal arts education, so I
knew about Peter Abelard from early day. But

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:19.020
I had a chance to get reacquainted with him
when HP bought Compaq, because they had code

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:32.050
names. HP was called Heloise. . And Compaq
was called Abelard. It was unfortunate. [laughter]

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:39.610
And it was entirely Michael Capellas' own
doing for not Googling Peter Abelard to realize

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:45.710
that Carly Fiorina who, of course, was the
classic scholar knew the history completely

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:52.980
and knew that as a result of this love affair
Peter Abelard was castrated. [laughter] So,

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:58.290
I did a little digging around that time. Sort
of stuck in the back of my mind as I was looking

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:06.430
for a title for this book. So, that's the
Abelard of Abelard to Apple. Apple is the

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:16.300
Apple of Abelard to Apple. Sort of inspired
by iTunes U. And really the book is about

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:23.040
this historical arc -- I'm not only not an
economist I'm not a historian -- but I do

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:30.050
talk about the historical arc from this 11th
century monk who's arguably the first true

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:36.730
pure university professor to what's happening
in education today. At the time that I wrote

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:44.130
the book, that was kind of epitomized by iTunes,
iTunes U. Peter Abelard was physically imposing,

00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:51.760
compelling, handsome guy who would draw thousands
of people to hear his lectures. He was an

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.580
iconoclast. He thought nothing of tweaking
the nose of the ecclesiastical establishment.

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:05.199
His master work is something called 'yes and
no'. 'Sic et non' in Latin. And it's really

00:08:05.199 --> 00:08:12.720
a way of using the inherent contradictions
of the church hierarchy of the day to form

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:18.240
these arguments and students would learn how
to argue on that basis. So it was all about

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.040
mentoring. It was all about the physical presence
of Peter Abelard and what he had to offer

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:33.779
to his students. And what's that got to do
with iTunes U or YouTube edu? Well, in many

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:39.199
ways what we're talking about is projecting
modern day Peter Abelards out to, not an audience

00:08:39.199 --> 00:08:45.119
of thousands of people who come from medieval
towns in Europe, but to a global audience

00:08:45.119 --> 00:08:53.829
who are looking for that kind of engagement.
The subtitle of the book is "the Fate of American

00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:59.220
Colleges and universities." So why not the
future of American colleges and universities?

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:04.869
As one of the reviewers of the book said fate
is a much more interesting word than future.

00:09:04.869 --> 00:09:10.869
Sort of draws you into a discussion of what
the fate [audience member comments] -- yes,

00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:20.790
well, so the fate of universities, it turns
out, is to be subject to the same economic,

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:28.800
political, geographic forces as every other
human institution. And from that premise,

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:34.760
a lot of things follow. And we'll talk about
some of them today. Believe it or not, believe

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:38.720
it or not, you can get into a very good argument
in faculty lounges about whether or not that

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:49.480
proposition is true. Maybe we'll have that
discussion today. But my view on this is not

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.180
that I'm making a prediction about where universities
are going to go. I'm not making a prediction

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:59.009
about higher education. I'm simply making
the observation that higher education, whether

00:09:59.009 --> 00:10:05.910
it's here or in China or in Europe, is a human
endeavor. And it's going to be following paths

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:12.420
that we have seen historically and we kind
of know how things are going to turn out in

00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:17.059
some of those cases.

00:10:17.059 --> 00:10:21.290
[pause]

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:33.350
Well, let me kind of get into it. There are
some controversial things in this book. And

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:41.519
let me just begin by facing those head on.
Not nearly as controversial as I thought some

00:10:41.519 --> 00:10:53.869
of my arguments were going to be. I was with
a colleague -- so I'm very hard about criticizing,

00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:58.319
for example, accrediting agencies and the
idea of accreditation in higher education.

00:10:58.319 --> 00:11:03.519
And I thought I was really going to be edgy
about this. And I was with a colleague last

00:11:03.519 --> 00:11:09.329
week who said, "well, why did you pull your
punches about accreditation?" So take this

00:11:09.329 --> 00:11:15.410
idea of controversy with a grain of salt.
But some of the things that people have mentioned

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:24.470
and talked about have to do with comparisons
that I make. So for example, I talk a lot

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:32.379
about faculty-centrism and student-centrism
in universities. And I do this in a way that

00:11:32.379 --> 00:11:39.300
could very easily be misunderstood which is
great for selling books. But the idea is that

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:47.089
very early in the history of western universities,
there was a schism in the idea of a university.

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:53.540
So the Italian universities -- the first universities
were what are called student-centered universities.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:59.100
Students would come from all over Europe,
all over the world actually to places like

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:06.699
Bologna because there was a concentration
of scholars who knew about law in Bologna.

00:12:06.699 --> 00:12:12.489
But the university played virtually no role
in that at all. Students would show up. They

00:12:12.489 --> 00:12:17.560
would decide whether or not they wanted to
pay to attend. They would decide whether or

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:27.220
not a professor was giving them value for
what they sought. The state provided sanctions

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:32.269
for non-performance. The students sort of
ran the show. Then, the French got a hold

00:12:32.269 --> 00:12:38.110
of the idea of universities and the whole
picture changed. French became what are called

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:44.759
master universities. And the idea of a master
university is that the faculty members are

00:12:44.759 --> 00:12:51.670
in charge. And of course what happens when
a profession takes over an institution is

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:57.940
the minutia of the profession tends to dominate
the internal discussion. So you'll find these

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:05.170
letters among French professors from the 13th
century that talk, for example, about how

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:10.800
fast they should write -- you know, write
out their notes. You want students to actually

00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.759
be able to take notes contemporaneously. There's
a group that says yes; there's a group that

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:26.119
says no. There's a lot of the sociology of
the way the university works that owes directly

00:13:26.119 --> 00:13:32.569
to this kind of contradictory view of university.
Southern universities in Europe were basically

00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:41.540
run by and for students. Northern universities,
by and for faculty members. When the U.S.

00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:47.480
kind of imported the idea of a university,
what universities did they look toward? Oxford,

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:53.730
Cambridge, Johns Hopkins looked toward the
German research university. So this idea of

00:13:53.730 --> 00:14:01.920
a faculty-centric culture kind of is carried
along in that way. And Frederick Rudolph,

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:08.509
who has a wonderful history of higher education
in the U.S., makes the point that at the point

00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:13.629
in which the Johns Hopkins faculty just after
the civil war was deciding how they were going

00:14:13.629 --> 00:14:21.660
to work, they decided that it was the purpose
of the students to stimulate the faculty rather

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:28.119
than the other way around. And that's kind
of a metaphor for how universities develop,

00:14:28.119 --> 00:14:37.079
particularly research universities. I'm critical
of presidents in this book. In fact, I have

00:14:37.079 --> 00:14:42.699
a whole chapter called the Smartest Kid in
Class. And I think the title kind of says

00:14:42.699 --> 00:14:48.399
it all. Presidents are the people who are
most able to change directions when they see

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:58.519
universities heading off in unproductive ways.
And some of them have in the past. You know,

00:14:58.519 --> 00:15:05.250
when Harvard abolished its required curriculum,
it was because Charles Elliot, much to the

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:11.480
surprise of the people that hired him as president
said, "we're not going to have required courses

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.239
anymore." And sort of brought the required
classical Latin based curriculum of American

00:15:17.239 --> 00:15:29.119
higher education down. And I really do lament
the -- I think decreasingly small fraction

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:38.779
of American presidents that are willing to
do bold things. There are relatively few.

00:15:38.779 --> 00:15:49.739
And we'll come back to that. I mentioned some
of them in the book as well. I guess the other

00:15:49.739 --> 00:15:56.189
thing that tends to draw incoming fire is
actually not something I say in the book,

00:15:56.189 --> 00:16:04.769
not something I intended, but it's a kind
of made-up clash between the sciences and

00:16:04.769 --> 00:16:10.819
the humanities. So I talk in the book a lot,
for example, about the value of a university.

00:16:10.819 --> 00:16:18.389
I'm not the first person to talk about the
value of a university. Discussion's been going

00:16:18.389 --> 00:16:27.369
on for a long time. But liberal arts professors
have interpreted this as me requiring a dollar

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:36.239
value to be placed on the output of a university
on the university degree. And I guess the

00:16:36.239 --> 00:16:40.259
unwritten assumption there is that if you're
in the arts, if you're in the humanities it's

00:16:40.259 --> 00:16:45.319
much more difficult to quantify the value
of your degree. That's an interesting discussion.

00:16:45.319 --> 00:16:52.920
It's not one that I intended. Although given
the dramatic increase in cost of a college

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.449
education, sort of a timely discussion to
have. Because when you're paying $2,000 a

00:16:59.449 --> 00:17:04.449
year for a college education and you decide
that you want to major in art history, it

00:17:04.449 --> 00:17:09.490
becomes relatively less important about how
you're going to pay off that college loan

00:17:09.490 --> 00:17:16.970
than when you're paying $50,000 a year which
is the situation that we have now. It's only

00:17:16.970 --> 00:17:23.250
been a couple of months since student loan
debt crossed over credit card debt as a major

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:32.150
source of indebtedness for American families.
So a lot of the things that we believe about

00:17:32.150 --> 00:17:36.781
the value of a college education has this
context around it which says well, the college

00:17:36.781 --> 00:17:43.270
education is relatively cheap. It's a place
where post adolescents go, grow and learn

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:51.840
this stuff and then they leave and do other
things. And that world has certainly changed.

00:17:51.840 --> 00:18:11.570
[pause] Yeah, I talked about kind of backyard
summer picnic conversations I had with neighbors.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:17.130
There's a big discussion that's taking place
kind of outside earshot of college professors

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:23.441
about colleges. And a lot of it is informed
by what you see in the media. A lot of it

00:18:23.441 --> 00:18:30.750
is informed by assumptions about the way universities
work. If you spend any time, for example,

00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:35.490
watching cable news broadcasts, you'll see
someone get up and say, "we're producing too

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:41.180
few college students, we're producing college
students that flip burgers for a living. Cost

00:18:41.180 --> 00:18:47.720
of college is driven by the availability of
student loans." A lot of statements made about

00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:55.669
the way higher education works. So I wanted,
in this book, to not be a textbook about how

00:18:55.669 --> 00:19:02.990
universities work, but to be a story. That's
how I got to this Abelard to Apple title.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:10.419
I wanted it to be a story that kind of conveys
not only the sweep of what's happened over

00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:16.679
the last thousand years in higher education,
but also drills down on some of these issues.

00:19:16.679 --> 00:19:22.070
So this issue, for example, of how many college
students should we be producing. Are we producing

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:28.889
college students that flip burgers for a living?
Is kind of conditioned on the fact that no

00:19:28.889 --> 00:19:36.539
one has ever checked to see. How many college
graduates should we be producing? A guy named

00:19:36.539 --> 00:19:44.240
Anthony Carnevale from Georgetown university
decided to do a horizontal study, a macroeconomic

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.970
study of the production of college graduates
-- and it turns out that the U.S. has been

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:55.740
under-producing college graduates for the
last 30 years. To the tune of about a million

00:19:55.740 --> 00:20:04.720
students a year. So, we sit here today in
2012 and we are probably 20 million short.

00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:05.720
Yes?

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:07.399
&gt;&gt;Male#1: [inaudible]

00:20:07.399 --> 00:20:12.660
&gt;&gt;Rich: So the question is what does it mean
to say you're under-producing? The demand

00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:20.159
for college graduates exceeds the supply by
about a million students a year. Now, you

00:20:20.159 --> 00:20:24.600
know that's the number that you can look at
and say, 'yeah, but where are those students

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:29.331
going to go?' And they went further than that.
So what they did is they looked at the Department

00:20:29.331 --> 00:20:35.370
of Labor ranking of skill levels that are
required for jobs. So just, you know, kind

00:20:35.370 --> 00:20:43.200
of in rough terms there are jobs that have
very low threshold for skill requirements.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:48.850
Retail clerks, for example. There are highly
skilled jobs. Rocket scientists. Google engineers.

00:20:48.850 --> 00:20:57.669
And there are in the middle jobs that may
or may not be filled by people with college

00:20:57.669 --> 00:21:04.860
degrees. So, if you look at the lowest skill
level for example, indeed, you will find college

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:09.020
graduates filling some of the -- there are
college graduates that flip burgers for a

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:14.679
living but not many. Not many. Somewhere to
one and two percent of those jobs are held

00:21:14.679 --> 00:21:20.750
by college graduates. And it turns out, if
you're flipping burgers for a living you're

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.660
better off having a college degree than not.
Because over the lifetime of your burger flipping

00:21:25.660 --> 00:21:33.740
career, you will end up financially better
off than someone with only a high school degree.

00:21:33.740 --> 00:21:43.110
So, you can kind of look at the coffee, you
know, coffee table discussions of what's going

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.370
on in higher education. Say, well, there are
things that are true we can measure. There

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:53.370
are things that are not true we can only ponder.
And then there are trends and direction. And

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:58.151
that's really what I want to talk about. And
I want to tell you a story. And I'll read

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:07.630
a short passage from the book. But the story,
in order to make sense of the story, you sort

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:14.740
of have to understand that higher education
in this country in most countries of the world

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:20.259
is a class system. Kind of a jarring concept.
You think of universities as being meritocracies

00:22:20.259 --> 00:22:26.000
s and egalitarian and all this. They're a
class system. And one of the manifestations

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.679
of being a class system is that there are
universities at the top. There are elite universities.

00:22:32.679 --> 00:22:41.100
And we all know who is in that class. The
Ivy Leagues, for example, are in that class.

00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:47.320
Georgia Tech may or may not be in that class.
But Dade Community College is certainly not

00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:54.659
in that class. That is the middle. There are
somewhere between three and four thousand

00:22:54.659 --> 00:22:59.570
universities in the middle. universities that
are not distinguished by the size of their

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:05.710
endowment. By the distinguished nature of
their alumni. By the scholarly achievements

00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:14.140
of their faculty. They're in the middle. And
life in the middle is not terrific right now.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:22.090
It's a financial struggle. It's a cultural
struggle. It's a political struggle.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:32.321
So let me kind of turn to a passage in the
book from a chapter entitled Beware the Well-Oiled

00:23:32.321 --> 00:23:44.259
Machine. Because I think it will tell you
a little bit about the middle..

00:23:44.259 --> 00:23:53.360
[reading] Linda's first challenge when she
was named department head was to reform the

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.610
curriculum. Students were required to take
the introductory courses in her department.

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:03.279
This requirement meant that the instructional
workload for the introductory teachers amounted

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:08.240
to thousands of credit hours per year, many
more contact hours that would be consistent

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:13.320
with effective mentoring. Over time, the department
had to figure out how to cope with such a

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:20.870
high workload. They decided to become sort
of a factory. Part-time instructors, usually

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:26.070
retired professionals, were handed an hour
by hour lesson plan in a large stack of overhead

00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:32.990
transparencies for recitation to 100 freshmen.
Projects were carried out in smaller groups

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:38.559
under the supervision of teaching assistants
many of them students themselves. Tenure track

00:24:38.559 --> 00:24:43.509
faculty had virtually no contact with freshmen.
And there was no faculty supervision of the

00:24:43.509 --> 00:24:50.150
introductory course sequence. A student services
organization staffed entirely by non-faculty

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:55.539
academic professionals and advisors oversaw
the entire operation which consumed a sizable

00:24:55.539 --> 00:25:02.870
fraction of the department's operating budget.
By 2002, the results were indisputable. A

00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:08.399
cheating scandal was exposed to the glare
of national media. Lab assignments and projects

00:25:08.399 --> 00:25:12.860
designed as a rite of passage by upper class
men and graduate students required an unreasonable

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:17.419
amount of time to complete and were wildly
out of sync with the academic goals of most

00:25:17.419 --> 00:25:21.779
students. Business, science, and engineering
students, for example, were barred from using

00:25:21.779 --> 00:25:26.649
tools that the instructors did not like. Even
though familiarity with those tools will be

00:25:26.649 --> 00:25:31.590
required in later courses on campus. Student
complaints far exceeded any other unit on

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:38.809
campus and the attrition rate in Linda's department
was well-above 50 percent. Even worse, the

00:25:38.809 --> 00:25:44.309
introductory courses alienated female students.
Male teaching assistants assigned project

00:25:44.309 --> 00:25:48.980
tasks by gender. Women were assigned writing
and documentation tasks; men were assigned

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:54.659
leadership roles. Female enrollment was a
full ten points lower than the national average

00:25:54.659 --> 00:25:59.409
and 20 points below the levels in the other
departments in the university. Open-ended

00:25:59.409 --> 00:26:05.340
comments from students confirmed that there
were few mature guiding hands in the introductory

00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:10.830
courses. So Linda's first step was to hire
Mark, a respected senior professor who had

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:16.330
a reputation as a sort of turn around expert,
to guide the reorganization of the of the

00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:20.970
student services. Mark began to review operations
of the student services organization, but

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:25.470
long time staffers immediately warned him
that he should not mess around with how things

00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:29.850
were currently being done because it's a well-oiled
machine.

00:26:29.850 --> 00:26:35.909
It was a revelation. Even the support staff
thought of themselves as workers on the factory

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:40.960
floor. And the learning spaces reflected it.
Students hung out on long wooden benches in

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:46.720
a large lobby area with a shabby green carpet.
To get to instructor's offices students had

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:53.080
to pass under a hand-lettered sign that said
'swamp'. This was a remarkably effective setup

00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:57.509
for the students who chose to remain. But
students on campus and off campus were choosing

00:26:57.509 --> 00:27:02.409
other paths in increasingly large numbers.
Students liked but did not respect their instructors

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:08.850
and their ratings were alarmingly low. Despite
a public scandal, an alarming retention rate

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:14.080
among the best students, an increasingly hostile
environment for females, and poor ratings

00:27:14.080 --> 00:27:18.570
from students and faculty members in other
departments, students services staff members

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:23.830
received consistently high marks from their
supervisors during annual performance reviews.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:30.139
It did not take Mark long to figure out why
the supervisors loved the well-oiled machine.

00:27:30.139 --> 00:27:34.460
The cost of instruction for the introductory
courses was low and advisors who effectively

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:40.280
moved the few students who chose to remain
through the program without a lot of hassle.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.850
Accreditation teams routinely approved the
curriculum without requiring much from the

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:51.649
department. And best of all, tenured faculty
members were rarely bothered by undergraduates.

00:27:51.649 --> 00:27:55.659
While students, alumni and an alarmed public
were letting Mark know that the well-oiled

00:27:55.659 --> 00:28:01.429
machine was not doing its job. The department's
research reputation continued to rise in national

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:08.040
rankings. In the strange accounting of the
middle, things were going well. [finishes

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.040
reading]

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:19.590
So, this is a story that's repeated many thousands
of times around the country. And it is a metaphor

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:34.480
for a lot of the discussions about where higher
education is going to take us. So where is

00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.059
it going? I want to talk about disruption.
There are a lot of books about disruption

00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:45.909
out there. It seems like every week there's
a new book about disruption in higher education.

00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:52.789
And I don't mean to add to that list of books.
A lot of books look at the situation say more

00:28:52.789 --> 00:29:00.230
funding -- that's going to help. Or more technology.
Stop coddling professors. There are certainly

00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:08.460
a lot of books that look at the alarming increase
in tuition costs and have suggestions about

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:17.639
how to fix that; get rid of tenure, stop paying
professors, use part-time faculty members.

00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:22.950
Very few people have looked for example about
what's driving the increase in costs in higher

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:35.169
education. The number one cost driver in higher
education is making up for lost revenue. So

00:29:35.169 --> 00:29:44.490
you saw in the 2008 crash endowments go down.
You saw states slashing university budgets.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:48.690
universities continued to spend as if that
money were there. And the only source of funds

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:57.880
to do that is student tuition. So that was
the driver -- initial driver for tuition increases.

00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:01.870
The easy answer -- the things that people
talk to you about -- if we just had more productive

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:08.159
professors, if we paid professors less, -- don't
even make the top 15. Don't even make the

00:30:08.159 --> 00:30:16.000
top 15. Intercollegiate athletics is a bigger
contributor to tuition increases than faculty

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.549
salaries. This is an interesting side bar.
I don't mean to get into intercollegiate athletics,

00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:28.090
because I love Georgia Tech football. But
the fact of the matter is -- if you look at

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:36.289
what is it? 119 BCS schools. 119 bowl-eligible
schools, football schools -- half of them

00:30:36.289 --> 00:30:44.220
lose money. Half of them lose money. I'm sorry
-- two thirds of them lose money. Half of

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:54.160
them lose ten million dollars or more a year.
Where does that money come from? Comes from

00:30:54.160 --> 00:31:01.440
academics. The only fundable source of revenue
in the university is the stuff that goes classrooms.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:09.990
So when you look at the layers of kind of
cause-effect for why tuitions are going through

00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:17.029
the roof, there are 14 or 15 drivers like
that that contribute. Yes?

00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:22.789
&gt;&gt;Male #2: [inaudible] 10 million dollar donation.
[inaudible]

00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:28.860
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yeah, so presidents will say -- presidents
have been known to say -- my president has

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:37.249
been known to say -- this is being recorded.
[laughter] That athletics is a front porch

00:31:37.249 --> 00:31:42.369
to the university. That donations to athletics
don't compete with academics because those

00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:48.130
people would never contribute to athletics
anyway. It's a hypothesis that's never been

00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:53.639
tested and every dean in the country will
be able to tell you stories about a potential

00:31:53.639 --> 00:32:02.789
academic donor that was swiped by athletics.
Why put your nail on this chemistry lab when

00:32:02.789 --> 00:32:08.299
you don't understand what's going on when
you can have this beautiful sky box in our

00:32:08.299 --> 00:32:15.110
football stadium. So there's an extraction
of value -- an extraction of wealth from one

00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:23.219
part of the university -- a non-core activity
by the way -- from a core activity -- academics

00:32:23.219 --> 00:32:33.659
-- to a non-core activity. Research -- let's
just spend a couple of seconds talking about

00:32:33.659 --> 00:32:42.830
research. There's a firm belief in universities
that research adds to the bottom line of the

00:32:42.830 --> 00:32:47.039
university -- sponsored research. If we just
had a bigger research program, we could fix

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:53.980
our finances. I was driving across -- what's
that little part of Texas that sticks up?

00:32:53.980 --> 00:33:00.450
Is that the pan handle? Driving across the
Texas pan handle and I saw a sign for a local

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:08.540
university that said 'University X Y Z -- the
next great research University'. And I had

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:15.810
to stop the car and call my wife. [laughter]
In the first place, this is a university that

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.049
has no chance at all of being the next great
research university. And they already have

00:33:20.049 --> 00:33:25.220
some great undergraduate programs. I know
what it's going to cost them to pursue that

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:32.820
goal. It costs a university 2.5 dollars to
bring in every dollar of sponsored research.

00:33:32.820 --> 00:33:39.539
It's a number that people have a hard time
getting their arms around, but it's true.

00:33:39.539 --> 00:33:45.800
If you just take a look at the productivity
decrease, long sales cycle, the large costs

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:53.650
of sales, the low success rate on contracts,
and did a P and L for the university, you

00:33:53.650 --> 00:33:57.820
would find that that dollar of revenue costs
you two and a half dollars to bring in. That's

00:33:57.820 --> 00:34:05.460
why industrial research labs cost the government
two or three times what a university research

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:10.679
lab will cost, because they can't take money
from academic programs to cover the cost of

00:34:10.679 --> 00:34:25.600
research. So there are lots of books about
disruption. What do you do about this? A lot

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:35.460
of books say change who you are. A lot of
say, as it's Clayton Christensen's new book

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:41.440
which I happen to love, says change the DNA
of the university. It never works that way.

00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:50.980
It's hard to change who you are. And when
I have this kind of discussion with, you know,

00:34:50.980 --> 00:34:56.540
presidents who are doing, you know, off-site
planning sessions for their senior leadership

00:34:56.540 --> 00:35:02.590
teams, the first thing I say is, "you can't
change who you are." You can discover who

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:10.021
you are. You can figure out what your value
is. It's a very difficult thing to do. There's

00:35:10.021 --> 00:35:18.710
an easy exercise for college presidents. And
you can sometimes get away with it. I will

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:23.900
print hard copies of strategic plans from
two universities. The one I'm visiting and

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:31.231
just another university and x out the names
of the identifying names in the document and

00:35:31.231 --> 00:35:39.590
show them to leadership team, 'so which is
which? You tell me'. And, as you might expect,

00:35:39.590 --> 00:35:44.151
you can just freely substitute the names of
universities between strategic plans and it

00:35:44.151 --> 00:35:50.610
doesn't make any difference. How can you make
a cogent argument about your value if you

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:55.090
have a completely generic view about what
you're doing? We're going to empower students.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:36:01.110
We're going to promote success. We're going
to have a diverse campus. All the things you

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:06.950
find in strategic plans for universities,
they're the same from university to university.

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:13.740
With the exception of places who have thought
through who they are. In those universities

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:19.680
just shined like stars. They're not necessarily
going to be successful, but they shine like

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:27.360
stars. So, if you look at Harvey Mudd's strategic
plan for example, it talks about the liberal

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:33.850
arts education of an engineer scientist. It
talks about producing people that can go into

00:36:33.850 --> 00:36:40.750
policy positions, that can go into law school.
It talks about teaching liberal arts subjects

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.090
in an integral fashion with technical subjects.
It talks about teaching writing as part of

00:36:45.090 --> 00:36:52.640
a math course. That's a new idea. If you look
at the strategic plan for Arizona State University,

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:56.860
sort of a university that's in the middle.
Near the top of the middle, but it's in the

00:36:56.860 --> 00:37:04.700
middle. What does it say? It says our goal
is to provide access to all qualified students

00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:09.190
in the state of Arizona. And what do they
mean by "qualified students?" They don't mean

00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:15.380
they're doing an increasingly strict selection
of freshman. It means they looked at what

00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:22.310
the admission requirements were for students
at Berkeley in 1960. B average, good test

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:27.150
scores, good recommendations for high school
students. That's the bar at Arizona State.

00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:32.230
Now, it's a big number. It's a frightening
large number. And they have to figure out

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:37.060
how to deal with that. But it's an example
of a university that's rooted -- it's a public

00:37:37.060 --> 00:37:42.520
university. It's rooted in the place. They
understand the place that they exist in and

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:50.150
their mission is dedicated to providing value
to those students. So you can see university

00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:55.290
after university that's thought through this,
that's not the 2000, that's not the 3,000.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.600
Those are the shining stars. Those are the
universities that have an idea of what students

00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:09.170
will get when they get their degree. Georgia
Tech is one of those universities. So there's

00:38:09.170 --> 00:38:16.760
a lot of data known, for example, about return
on investment for tuition. You can look at

00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:22.470
what you paid for tuition versus what you'll
earn over the next 30 years. And people have

00:38:22.470 --> 00:38:28.230
collected this data. There's a handful of
universities at the top. It used to be that

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:32.951
those numbers overwhelmingly favored a university
education. If you got a university degree,

00:38:32.951 --> 00:38:39.310
you were guaranteed to get a good return return
on your tuition investment. That number has

00:38:39.310 --> 00:38:44.470
gone down. But there are some universities
at the top. Cal Tech is at the top. MIT is

00:38:44.470 --> 00:38:50.940
at the top. Berkeley is at the top. The number
one expressed as a percentage return on investment

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:57.090
over 30 years. Number one university in the
country is Georgia Tech. 14 percent return

00:38:57.090 --> 00:39:03.830
on investment even with the raised tuition,
that's not a bad return on investment. So

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:07.300
what is Georgia Tech's value proposition?
Georgia Tech's value proposition is when you

00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:13.840
come out of Georgia Tech as a bench engineer.
We certainly produce people who get Rhodes

00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.980
scholarships and go onto graduate school and
become great scientists. But our strong suit

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:26.420
is that we produce tough, competitive, knowledgeable,
flexible engineers. And that's why they do

00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:37.400
well over their career. So this idea of knowing
your value is extremely important. So, you

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:45.610
know, there are these books that will lay
out the problems for you. I think everyone

00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:52.640
kind of recognizes what the problems are.
I want to concentrate in the little time I

00:39:52.640 --> 00:40:00.551
have left by kind of talking about what's
going on and what can be done about it. You

00:40:00.551 --> 00:40:09.050
should have, I think, been able to figure
out by now that in a lot of ways higher education

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:14.410
-- particularly in the United States -- is
an economic bubble. Tuition is growing four

00:40:14.410 --> 00:40:24.110
times cost of living. There's a sense of entitlement
on the part of institutions. There's a lack

00:40:24.110 --> 00:40:30.080
of genuine oversight by agencies that are
supposed to make sure that what's going on

00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:36.040
is what's supposed to. It has all the characteristics
of an economic bubble. And higher education

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:40.390
is 4 percent of GDP. So high a collapsing
bubble in higher education is a pretty big

00:40:40.390 --> 00:40:55.240
deal for the U.S. economy. What can you do
about that? I would like to think -- and this

00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:00.110
gets back to what I was saying a few minutes
ago about presidents. I would like to think

00:41:00.110 --> 00:41:07.320
that the things that made American higher
education great can be reignited. So what

00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:15.620
are those things? If I had to talk to you
about just one thing, it would be the idea

00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:23.840
of experimentation. Where are the experiments
in higher education? Where is the new Williams

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:31.640
college? If you go back 1,000 years and trace
this history -- trace this history through.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:40.240
In the Middle Ages, there were dozens of universities.
You can keep them all in your head. There

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:48.150
was Bologna and Padua; Barcelona and Paris.
Later on Oxford. There were just dozens of

00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:53.720
them. Not a large number. And they went through
the same kinds of processes that we're talking

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:58.380
about now. They became inwardly focused. They
became entitled. They became ossified. A lot

00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:07.160
of people called them 'homes of out-moded
knowledge', reading the critics of the day.

00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:13.260
Until the Jesuits came along. Jesuits in the
south, the academies in the north. They said

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:18.810
"wait a minute, wait a minute. We have a new
way of educating students. You guys have written

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:23.300
all the textbooks. We know what it means to
teach a student." And so, they attracted a

00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:31.720
whole new kind of student who was willing
to pay a different amount of money for education.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:39.810
And it upset the apple cart by the time the
colonial universities got going in the U.S.,

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:48.020
there were hundreds of universities. Hundreds
here. England only had two, three. We had

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:54.470
hundreds. After the civil war, there were
thousands. I talk in the book about 1852.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:43:01.070
1852 is, in my way of thinking, a banner year
for American higher education, because the

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:13.020
number of brilliantly conceived universities
that were founded in 1852 is phenomenal. Tufts

00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:22.730
was founded. Mills was founded. Sort of unclear
when Amherst and Williams were founded, but

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:33.680
it was in that same period of time. At the
turn of the century, between the U.S. and

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:40.330
Asia, tens of thousands of universities -- so
a lot of these places don't exist today. They

00:43:40.330 --> 00:43:45.150
were experiments. When you have experiments,
sometimes you have success, sometimes you

00:43:45.150 --> 00:43:52.940
have failures. But we have had, in this country,
no experiments since 1960. There has been

00:43:52.940 --> 00:43:57.540
literally no increase in capacity since 1960.
There has been one new research university

00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:05.910
since the turn of the century. Since 2000.
UC Merced and UC Merced is kind of on life-support

00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:14.250
at the moment because of the California economic
situation. Meanwhile, what's happening? India

00:44:14.250 --> 00:44:23.110
has announced plans to open 37,000 new universities.
Why 37,000? Well, they did the arithmetic.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.791
India currently sends 11 to 12 percent of
their high school students to college. They

00:44:26.791 --> 00:44:31.420
know that in order to be internationally competitive,
the number has to be closer to 50 percent.

00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:38.430
Do the math, that's about 300 million students.
Divide that up among 10,000 student universities,

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:43.810
it's about 30,000 universities. Now you can't
open that many universities in ten years.

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.460
There's not enough bricks in India to do that
probably. So they must have something else

00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:52.960
in mind. They do. They don't know exactly
what. So there's going to be lots of experimentation

00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:56.960
and there's going to be a lot of innovation
in India that will change what it means to

00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:04.050
be a university. For a large population that
is just gathering steam in western economies.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:09.030
And the same thing holds true with China.
At the same time, the U.S. is withdrawing

00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:16.890
and not carrying out this kind of experimentation.
Except for, dare we say it, the for profit

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:25.440
institutions which everyone thinks of as the
low cost supplier of continuing education

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.180
for the country. There's a hot bed of innovation
that's taking place there. You would hope

00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:37.680
that that would ignite a hot bed of innovation
in American universities. And the fact is,

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:45.830
it hasn't. There are a few. Stanford is doing
a massively open online course in AI. MIT

00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:53.980
has announced MITx and was the first out of
the gate with open course ware. There are

00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:59.510
a lot of universities in that top category
-- in that elite category -- that feel they

00:45:59.510 --> 00:46:06.140
have the freedom to spread their wings in
experiment. But for the most part, institutions

00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:14.050
in the middle are not experimenting. They're
sort of stuck in the past. And at the end

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:19.800
of the book, I sort of talk about the consequences
of this. And we don't have time for me to

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:26.300
read the entire passage. So let me just tell
you what I'm talking about here and then we

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:32.820
can open this up to questions or discussion.
So one of these schools that was founded in

00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:40.410
1852, was Antioch College. Founded by Horace
Mann. The great progressive leader of American

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:47.060
higher education of the 19th century and for
most of its history Antioch College was a

00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:54.580
beacon of progressive thought. Coretta Scott
King went there. It enrolled the first African

00:46:54.580 --> 00:47:05.760
American classes for the first truly integrated
African-American classes. They became a place

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:16.900
where people thought they could go to become
part of a movement. In fact, I was -- this

00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:24.450
is interesting history here. I was driving
across the country in 1969. And happened to

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.360
stop in Antioch. I didn't happen to stop in
Antioch. I wanted to stop in Antioch. And

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:37.070
just sort of absorb the culture. It was kind
of a cross between Berkeley and Madison. It

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:42.420
was a really cool place to be and I hadn't
thought about Antioch much until I was finishing

00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:50.840
the book. And as I was finishing the book,
I saw this Op Ed piece in the New York Times.

00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:59.570
It said Antioch was written as an obituary.
'Antioch: where the arts were too liberal'.

00:47:59.570 --> 00:48:09.690
So Antioch College closed in 2009. Closed
its doors. And there was a big investigation

00:48:09.690 --> 00:48:19.830
about why it was so -- the faculty lodged
complaints with the AAU, talking about the

00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:26.730
lack of processes for closing the university.
Well, the fact of the matter is, that the

00:48:26.730 --> 00:48:34.680
Antioch faculty had pushed through a strategic
plan two years before. And the strategic plan

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:41.480
was aimed at narrowing the scope of students
that would be acceptable to Antioch faculty.

00:48:41.480 --> 00:48:46.510
Hence, the title on the obituary 'where the
arts were too liberal'. You sort of had to

00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:53.261
pass a litmus test. And the predictable thing
happened. Their endowments went away. Their

00:48:53.261 --> 00:48:57.660
applications went away. When they closed their
doors, their freshman class had 50 students.

00:48:57.660 --> 00:49:03.970
They had 200 students enrolled. Their endowment
had shrunk to 5 million dollars. And they

00:49:03.970 --> 00:49:08.650
still had plans to re-open. Probably still
do have plans to re-open in the same way.

00:49:08.650 --> 00:49:15.321
And no one during this whole process thought
to ask what the role of that strategic plan

00:49:15.321 --> 00:49:22.800
was in the failure of Antioch. And the subtext
to this story is that Antioch is a wholly

00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:28.110
owned subsidiary of Antioch University, an
online university, whose enrollments just

00:49:28.110 --> 00:49:34.020
continue to grow. So Horace Mann's university
winked out of existence while the online university

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:53.750
grew. And the bookends with a little story
that I want to read to you. So I've completed

00:49:53.750 --> 00:50:00.170
the book. I'm talking to colleagues about
it. In an epilogue, I say this. [reading]

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:04.980
The Antioch college story came up at dinner
one evening. I was visiting the chair of a

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:11.320
a well-respected department at a large land
grant college in the middle, near the top

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.750
of the middle but struggling like most public
universities with budget cuts that threatened

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:21.160
to reverse gains in research stature made
during the last ten years. At the end of the

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:27.210
story, my host said, "that's not our problem,
we're at capacity. There's no way we can absorb

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:32.270
more students." I asked if there were more
students that could be admitted. He said,

00:50:32.270 --> 00:50:40.810
"sure," but they'll find somewhere else to
go." "Where?" I asked. He thought for a minute.

00:50:40.810 --> 00:50:47.540
And came up with a list of alternatives. Some
were above his institution in the reputational

00:50:47.540 --> 00:50:51.890
pyramid, some were in competitors and some
were in China and India. Then he said, "a

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:58.000
lot will get online degrees". "So you're getting
a smaller share of a growing number of students,"

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:05.220
I said. And he was quick with his reply. "Those
are students we don't want. You don't understand,

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.400
Rich, we have no more capacity." We went on
like this for a little while and finally I

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.090
asked why they were not figuring out how to
give those students access? What happens in

00:51:16.090 --> 00:51:21.290
a growing marketplace when you're losing market
share to your competitors who are building

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:28.341
capacity? He stopped. I pressed it. Where
will those students go in 100 years? What

00:51:28.341 --> 00:51:33.761
will universities that have capacity for those
students that you turn away look like. He

00:51:33.761 --> 00:51:38.851
realized like I was asking him what the university
of the 21st century would look like. After

00:51:38.851 --> 00:51:48.790
a long pause, he said, "it will not look like
us". And that's the moral of the story. Thank

00:51:48.790 --> 00:51:50.560
you.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:57.630
[Applause]
[female speaks indistinctly]

00:51:57.630 --> 00:52:01.170
&gt;&gt;Rich: Yes?

00:52:01.170 --> 00:52:15.410
&gt;&gt;Male #3: So I realized this is a broad question,
but what do you view as a sort of idea should

00:52:15.410 --> 00:52:21.250
there be a range of different kinds of universities?
Like, is Vo-tech and the University of Phoenixes

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:26.240
and the Harvards, do they all fulfill different
niches or do you want to see more niches or

00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:29.800
do you want to see them all converging into
one sort of thing.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:34.030
&gt;&gt;Rich: Converging into one sort of thing
is not a winning proposition. One of the reasons

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:40.310
that we're in this situation is what I call
institutional envy. If you're a public university

00:52:40.310 --> 00:52:44.720
in the middle, you look at the University
of Michigan and that's who you want to behave

00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:50.880
like. If you're a private university, you
look at Williams or Harvard depending on your

00:52:50.880 --> 00:52:57.200
size. That's who you want to emulate. So there's
a strong tendency for a lot of economic and

00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:05.480
social reasons to try to push up into this
hierarchy to create a canonical public university,

00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:10.160
a canonical private university. And it's been
deadly for American higher education. It gets

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:17.090
to this issue of experimentation. You want
lots of different options. The demographics

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:28.349
of higher ed is favoring that. The current
predictions are by 2020, the demographic for

00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:33.940
-- currently colleges and universities aim
at what's called the 18 to 24 year old range.

00:53:33.940 --> 00:53:40.980
So colleges are built to cater to these post
adolescents. By 2020, half of the students

00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:47.330
will be over the age of 24. So they will be
people returning to school. They will be single

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:51.550
parents. They will be Gulf War veterans that
are returning. They will be recent immigrants.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:53:56.990
They will be an aging population that are
returning to school. They'll be people that

00:53:56.990 --> 00:54:02.500
aren't going to be impressed by football teams
and dormitories. And so, where is the money

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:06.660
going to be? The money is going to be in catering
to where most of the students are. That's

00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:13.680
where most of the students are going to be.
So it really doesn't make any sense to say

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:19.060
just like the Jesuits said 600 years ago.
It doesn't make any sense to say, "well, this

00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.730
is what it means to be a faculty member. This
is what it means to be a student and here's

00:54:22.730 --> 00:54:28.690
the cost of doing that" when you have this
wide array of people that you are now looking

00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:39.030
at. I think the for-profits will be continuing
on for the foreseeable future. I think the

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:46.610
competitive pressure for online universities,
Open university in the UK enrolls couple hundred

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:52.270
thousand students. That's not a bad number.
You get a pretty good degree of out of Open

00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:58.210
university. That portfolio will continue.
The question for us is are we going to concentrate

00:54:58.210 --> 00:55:02.830
on this path that we've been on trying to
move up reputational hierarchy or are we going

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:07.660
to say it really is a much broader spectrum
out there than we previously imagined..

00:55:07.660 --> 00:55:20.520
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I have two seniors. One graduated
from high school. One graduated from college

00:55:20.520 --> 00:55:26.180
this year. One is considering engineering
school. One is at liberal arts school. I'm

00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:32.870
quite aware that getting the degree is only
a small part of going to college. For many

00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:38.540
parents, it's sending students off to a relatively
safe place to grow up and be experimental

00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:50.620
within bounds. How will that work when the
students are not maturing in that 18 to 24-year-old

00:55:50.620 --> 00:55:52.380
range, when they're older. And how will universities
have to evolve.

00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:58.040
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's a great question. And I don't
know the answer to that. I mean, you can see

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:03.990
there are a few models that are evolving.
You know, the Florida system, for example,

00:56:03.990 --> 00:56:10.921
has a large community college network that
feeds the 4-year institutions. And they're

00:56:10.921 --> 00:56:16.160
hitting this problem right now. So they have
recently arrived immigrants. They have high

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:22.270
school students that want to go to Central
Florida. Central Florida has a capacity problem.

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:29.940
How do those students enter into the system.
That's where technology is going to play a

00:56:29.940 --> 00:56:34.620
role. Do you sort of change the entry point
to universities. Is there something called

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:40.760
articulated curricula so you take into account
the fact that students enter into a college

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:47.990
curriculum for a variety of reasons at a variety
points that have similarly diverse off ramps.

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:52.410
Sometimes they leave with a degree. Sometimes
they don't leave with a degree. Can you capture

00:56:52.410 --> 00:56:57.930
the value of each of those streams and say
that's really what higher education is going

00:56:57.930 --> 00:57:07.060
to evolve into? Some of them will get on ships
and airplanes and go to Bangalore or go to

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:15.390
Seoul and find really, really terrific universities
that are well-funded by public funds. We just

00:57:15.390 --> 00:57:17.700
-- we don't know.

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:27.700
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Hi. So how would you comment on
universities here that are opening branches

00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:32.960
in other countries that have the money and
supposedly each of these universities have

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:42.020
the know-how, too. And they're trying to basically
jump the hurdle of the finance here by opening

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:46.140
there. And I don't know how they'll be doing
in like ten, 20 years.

00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:52.990
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's a mixed bag. And the experience
has been very mixed. And the Carnegie Mellon,

00:57:52.990 --> 00:57:57.201
for example, I'm looking at my friend, Jeff.
Carnegie Mellon has been sort of out there

00:57:57.201 --> 00:58:04.000
and opening international campuses. I don't
think it's been a great experience. I think

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:11.710
financially and intellectually, it just sort
of has a forced feeling to it. There are universities

00:58:11.710 --> 00:58:16.480
that have the brand where they can -- Harvard
can open an MBA program anywhere in the world

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:20.340
and attract students. That's not what we're
talking about. We're talking about University

00:58:20.340 --> 00:58:27.420
of New South Wales that decides to build a
200 million dollar campus in Singapore and

00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:34.410
three months later closes because the students
that were supposed to be there never materialized.

00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:45.740
And it's probably the case that there will
be a few global presences. You know, the -- I

00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:50.670
don't have any inside information, but the
overwhelming sense that you get from Stanford's

00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:57.930
foray into the New York competition, for example,
was Stanford expressing an interest in becoming

00:58:57.930 --> 00:59:04.770
a more global presence than it is. You can
already see that with Cornell. Those are experiments.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:11.470
Who knows how they're going to turn out. The
more interesting thing, I think, is to take

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:19.410
a look at who's populating the new iTunes
U app from Apple. Who are the first universities

00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:23.980
that are there. Well, Stanford is there. But
it's Open university. The pretty complete

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:31.710
set of offerings. And a little small university
that's offering IOS software development courses

00:59:31.710 --> 00:59:36.440
in pretty complete format. So those are the
kinds of experiments that I think are going

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:43.630
to be interesting. There are a lot of financial
incentives for opening foreign campuses that

00:59:43.630 --> 00:59:51.680
dry up once you kind of look behind the curtains.
I think the experience has not been great.

00:59:51.680 --> 01:00:00.750
&gt;&gt;Male #6: You alluded to it a little bit
earlier about the share of what people are

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:04.540
going into. So the exam you used is the value
of an art degree when you're paying 50,000

01:00:04.540 --> 01:00:10.010
dollars a year. And I was listening to the
State of the Union last night and Obama was

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:16.320
talking about the irony we have high unemployment
yet open jobs for people that are not sufficiently

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:20.980
technically prepared for it. In his -- he
was talking about people getting associates

01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:25.680
degrees for technical fields like that. But
what about the model that you talked about

01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:34.700
-- dismissing the core curriculum. The question
of -- how do I state this? How do we refer

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.702
this model that not only the number of college
graduates that we have but the ones that are

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:42.110
in the fields that are necessary and how do
we affect that model. To me in my college

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:46.470
career, it was always what are your interests
you should follow that which is is not necessarily

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:47.470
the best model for this.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:53.200
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's not necessarily the best model.
As I said when I started. It's a great question

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:58.680
to ask when you're paying $2,000 a year. It's
a completely academic question, if I can use

01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:05.550
that phrase, when you're paying 50,000 dollars
a year. It may be great to pursue a curriculum

01:01:05.550 --> 01:01:12.600
in the classics, if your education is free.
Or if you're not expecting that college degree

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:20.150
to be tied to a career goal. I used to teach
in Padua and I had this discussion with my

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:28.970
Italian students over the years as I was preparing
the book. And the model in Italy and through

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:34.190
most of Europe is that there is no direct
tie between a university education and a career

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:43.260
goal. In all of the surveys make that point
clear. [male in audience murmurs] Also, there's

01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:49.140
no tuition. So it gets back to this. If you're
not putting anything in and you're looking

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.340
at it as a growth experience that the state
is providing for you, you can afford to spend

01:01:53.340 --> 01:02:01.710
this time growing up. If it's a 250,000 dollar
investment for a family that's making 75,000

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:09.280
dollars a year, it's a completely different
issue. Also, I have to say -- and I don't

01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:13.830
say it in the book, but it's one of the things
that causes a sharp discussion with my friends

01:02:13.830 --> 01:02:19.570
in the humanities that the art histories and
the literature curricula are not doing a terrific

01:02:19.570 --> 01:02:26.100
job. As much as we'd like to think university
education is a great place to learn a liberal

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:34.300
arts background, the fact of the matter is
it doesn't happen. There's a study by a guy

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:40.580
named Richard [indistinct] looked at 2300
students across multiple years across a wide

01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:45.680
range of institutions to determine whether
or not the general ed requirements in a typical

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:52.570
college curriculum had any effect at all.
And the sad fact is half the time, you can't

01:02:52.570 --> 01:02:55.871
tell whether a student has been through the
first two years of college or not. You're

01:02:55.871 --> 01:03:03.080
measuring critical reading skills, writing
skills, reading skills -- all the things that

01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:07.340
you're supposed to get out of the first two
years which are largely liberal arts are not

01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:16.190
being done well. So that seems to be a field
that's ripe for ferment. But to get to where

01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:21.360
I think your question is going, you're much
better off with a college degree. And you're

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.520
much, much better off with a college degree
that's in a marketable area. Yes?

01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:37.880
&gt;&gt;Male #6: So you talked about the skyrocketing
cost of a college education. I wonder -- how

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.160
do you think financial aid figures into that.
Because students are sort of insulated from

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.320
the actual cost of their education. I guess
the connection these for profit universities

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:53.360
don't actually have to do it. You actually
have to pay for the education.

01:03:53.360 --> 01:04:00.410
&gt;&gt;Rich: No. The ones that are accredited are
in the same model. So accreditation entitles

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:09.780
students to receive Title 4 funds. So federally-backed
loans. People go into debt. I mean, as I said,

01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:16.580
the amount of debt that's being accrued for
higher education is frightening and growing.

01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:30.000
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Sort of along the same lines. Your
observation about skyrocketing tuition over

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.090
the past three or four years being caused
by vanishing endowments and things like that

01:04:35.090 --> 01:04:39.710
was interesting and vanishing budgets and
things like that. What do you think universities

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:44.440
should have done, given that all this money
disappeared?

01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:50.710
&gt;&gt;Rich: It's a great question. So a lot of
what you see in higher ed today is the result

01:04:50.710 --> 01:04:57.800
of what Clark Kerr who ran the University
of California system a generation ago called

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:03.370
the appearance of multiversity. You get all
these different stake holders together on

01:05:03.370 --> 01:05:10.480
campus. They're professional schools, undergraduate
institutions, and graduate schools. And they

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.710
all sort of share in the same pie. And as
long as the pie is growing, that tends to

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:26.840
work pretty well. But we're in a period of
contraction now. And not everyone is paying

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:33.490
his or her fair share of operating the university.
So we'll take sponsored research as a case

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:41.010
in point. The National Science Foundation,
major source of funding for basic research

01:05:41.010 --> 01:05:46.690
in academic computer science, comes nowhere
near covering the cost of the research. And

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:52.151
I'm not talking about overhead. I'm talking
about the absolute cost of the research. They

01:05:52.151 --> 01:05:59.050
know that to fund a 3-year project with these
goals requires this many professors and this

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:04.210
many students. And they will arbitrarily give
you one professor and one student to carry

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:09.030
out the same goal while you're still responsible
for that research. And universities take it

01:06:09.030 --> 01:06:17.390
on themselves to pull that money from somewhere.
It gets pulled from academic programs. So

01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:23.210
activity by activity, a non-core activity
on campus does not necessarily pay its own

01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:28.540
way. If you simply had the ability to reverse
that negative part of the multiversity and

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:33.460
say well we agree these are good activities
to have on campus but let's make sure everyone

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:39.700
pays his way, it will clarify a lot of the
economics. Hey, Jeff.

01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:43.100
&gt;&gt;Jeff: Hey rich I want to thank you again
for coming to Google and giving such a thought

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.790
provoking talk on a very relevant subject.

01:06:45.790 --> 01:06:46.790
[Applause]

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:47.680
&gt;&gt;Rich: Thank you, I appreciate it
