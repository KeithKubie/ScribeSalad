1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,420
[inaudible]

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,530
great. Let's talk about consciousness
a little bit. I just had Sam Harris on.

3
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:10,930
We've,
we've talked about it quite extensively.

4
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:15,280
I think you have some
thoughts on consciousness,
the nature of consciousness.

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,360
Indeed. Yeah. I mean it's
probably to do this right,

6
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,980
we would need to agree on a definition.

7
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:25,120
I'm not sure that that's any definition
that we choose will immediately

8
00:00:25,121 --> 00:00:29,110
antagonize some amount of your audience.
This is like defining div wedding.

9
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:34,570
This is like defining truth, which seems
to be tough these days. Yes, exactly. Um,

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,860
so maybe, maybe rather than that, um,

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:43,750
you are humans the only conscious
beings on this planet? I don't think so,

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,040
but we are the most conscious.

13
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:48,820
We are the most fully conscious and
we have better access to our own

14
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:50,320
consciousness obviously.

15
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:55,321
Then we have access to the consciousness
of say dolphins or elephants or other

16
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:59,710
apes or maybe wolves,

17
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:05,010
any of these long lived social organisms
with long childhoods and generational

18
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:09,760
overlap who lived sometimes with
three generations together at a time.

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,130
So this transmission of
cultural information,

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:17,140
organisms that have theory of mind and
can imagine can put themselves in the

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:20,860
other individual's position. And think,
what do they think is going on right now?

22
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:23,680
Even though I understand that that's
a different thing than what I think is

23
00:01:23,681 --> 00:01:24,514
going on right now,

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:28,600
which we now know that certain
monkeys and apes exactly do that. Yes,

25
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,520
theory of mind. There's
a beautiful book, um,

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:34,870
called baboon metaphysics
by the husband and wife,

27
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:39,430
team Chaney and Seyfarth that basically
explores theory of mind and baboons. Uh,

28
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,180
and you know, it's not the only one. Um,
they're, they're not the only species,

29
00:01:43,181 --> 00:01:43,871
but you know,

30
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:48,790
how do we as humans find our
consciousness best? You know, there,

31
00:01:48,791 --> 00:01:53,080
there are ways that we can hack into
what is sometimes been called flow states

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:56,350
or, um, you know, that's, that's
the most common one. But you know,

33
00:01:56,351 --> 00:02:00,790
we can do so through well,
through deep conversation, um,

34
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,410
through meditation,
through music,

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,860
some, sometimes through producing
it, but sometimes to experiencing,

36
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:12,280
especially live music,
dance for some people,

37
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,230
Hallucinogens, sex, sport, you know,

38
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,500
intense physical or physiological or
emotional experience in which we are just

39
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,020
moving with others usually. And you
know, there are those of us like myself,

40
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:32,530
you have a very strong introvert who
will find, so my deepest flow stays,

41
00:02:32,531 --> 00:02:34,420
you know,
access to consciousness alone.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,480
You're alone in the Amazon when I can
sit and watch monkeys and write that for

43
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,960
me. That's one of them. But sport is also,
so when I talked about this with Sam,

44
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:44,980
the way he was defining it,

45
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,290
which I think is sort of similar
to what you're saying here,

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,680
it strikes me as just like an extreme
ability to maintain presence in the moment

47
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,700
that that really sort of
when a basketball player,

48
00:02:56,701 --> 00:02:59,830
so if we use the sport analogy like a
basketball her when they're the zone,

49
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:03,850
you know, and Jordan scores 20 points and
five minutes and he just, he goes, well,

50
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,890
everything I threw up
just went in like that.

51
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:10,950
They hit that level of consciousness
or for you to be outside enough out of

52
00:03:11,351 --> 00:03:14,020
yourself to be able to write
in that perfect moment or,

53
00:03:14,021 --> 00:03:15,430
or whatever it is that it,
oh,

54
00:03:15,431 --> 00:03:19,420
it always seems about being present more
than anything else to me is a kind of,

55
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,313
um,

56
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,940
time stopping time stopping and
disappearing on you at the same time,

57
00:03:24,941 --> 00:03:27,430
which I think is part of why Anthea,
Jen's hallucinate,

58
00:03:27,431 --> 00:03:29,990
hallucinogens can kind of capture
that as well because they're,

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,970
the sense of time just disappearing
on you is, is remarkable. Um,

60
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,610
so you,

61
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,640
you both don't care about time and time
passes usually in ways that seem quicker

62
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,320
than you were expecting them to, uh, with,

63
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,960
with say sports or um, or
right. Meditation. I, yeah,

64
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:52,330
that's not one that I do, but, um, you
know, Sam has a lot to say about that.

65
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,240
Of course. Um, yeah,

66
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,910
I remember when I was doing mushrooms,

67
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,700
at least squares in college
aged somewhat consistently,

68
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,770
maybe every six months or something.
Um,

69
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:07,270
I would always want the clocks to
be covered. Yes. Because I hated it.

70
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,390
I hated the numbers are no
good. I did. I definitely did.

71
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:12,880
One trip like five hours in the mirror,
forget that.

72
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,180
But I always wanted the clocks to be
covered because the idea that time was

73
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:20,570
passing while I was in this state was,
was very scary to me.

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,200
That's scary. Or just, I just wanted
nothing to do with it. I guess.

75
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,450
Maybe it doesn't matter what
that distinction is, you know,

76
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,970
scary or just not interested.
Right. But, um, so it's,

77
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,500
it's very different.
The,

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,920
the kinds of consciousness enhancing
activities that we can engage in,

79
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:38,260
including hallucinogens
are very different.

80
00:04:38,261 --> 00:04:42,220
If you're inside in a room like this
where you have no access to what is going

81
00:04:42,221 --> 00:04:46,480
on climatologically or weather
wise outside, as opposed to if you,

82
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:51,540
if you are out and you can watch as the
sunsets and as the moon comes up and you

83
00:04:52,721 --> 00:04:57,070
can think again, oh, right, it's
a, it's a, it's a waxing moon.

84
00:04:57,071 --> 00:05:00,310
It'll be full in four days and um,
or you know,

85
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,970
or you're at a coast and you can watch
the tides and think about the shifting

86
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:05,170
time.
So for me,

87
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,620
thinking about time that is clearly being
brought as clearly being revealed by

88
00:05:11,891 --> 00:05:12,341
the planet.

89
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:17,341
We're on as opposed to coming
at me through a clock is
more meaningful and I'm,

90
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm willing to think
about time in that way,

91
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:24,930
but definitely not through clocks when
I'm, when I'm writing hallucinogen sport,

92
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,860
any of that.
Right.

93
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:31,200
And yet we have all of these devices
now that are men constantly talk to our

94
00:05:31,301 --> 00:05:36,301
time that are meant to take our attention
that does he literally designed this

95
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:38,500
way?
Do you sense runs like that?

96
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:42,730
There's actually a digital assault on
consciousness because maybe that really

97
00:05:42,731 --> 00:05:46,570
does explain so many of the other problems
we're having in society right now.

98
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:49,690
It's, it's one of the key pieces for sure.
And I think that phrase is brilliant.

99
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,080
A digital assault on consciousness.
This is something,

100
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,920
I'm Tristan Harris who I don't know,
but I bet him on the show. Yeah,

101
00:05:57,230 --> 00:06:00,050
I'm talks talks about a lot
and you know, he, he's been,

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,640
he has been ringing the alarm bell for
years about the algorithms that are being

103
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:06,560
put into our devices that are,

104
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,770
that are creating addicts out of us.

105
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:14,720
But more broadly, your, you know, the
digital assault on consciousness is,

106
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:16,520
there's not,
there is,

107
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:20,660
it's increasingly hard to find a space
where you're just actually free and clear.

108
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,291
And this is,
you know,

109
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:25,700
this is part of what I do for myself and
what I used to do for my students was

110
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:26,810
take them to places,

111
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,960
not only that we're remote and
where they could explore nature,

112
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,280
but where there was no cell signal where
there was no internet. So, you know,

113
00:06:34,281 --> 00:06:37,250
the deepest part of the Amazon that
I took students to, there's just,

114
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:40,250
there's no email, there's no internet,
there's no Wifi. We are, you know,

115
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:45,020
a plane ride over the Andes and then a
boat ride and then a truck ride and then

116
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:50,021
another five hours down a tributary of
the Amazon to a place with no roads,

117
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:54,180
no airstrips, nothing. And boy,

118
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:56,580
this time feel different and you need,

119
00:06:56,581 --> 00:06:59,480
you're sleeping in little
cabins that are screened.

120
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:03,710
And so you wake up when the insects and
the birds and the monkeys wake up and

121
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,420
they start talking at you.
They're not talking to you,

122
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:06,350
they're talking to themselves.

123
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:11,770
But you getting a sense of the rhythms
of the planet that we're on can return

124
00:07:13,131 --> 00:07:18,131
people I think to a real sense of self
and also to a sense of what they value,

125
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:19,820
what their passions are.

126
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,060
And this is a big thing that I
think is missing in many of the,

127
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,060
to return to what we were talking
about earlier. You know, the,

128
00:07:25,061 --> 00:07:26,690
the far left activists,

129
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,840
the control left mostly I
think lack another passion.

130
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,300
And I've said before I,
you know,

131
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,500
the prediction I would make is that you
have very few rock climbers or skiers

132
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,990
among the radical left activists.

133
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:46,610
People who have something that they can
engage in that frees them from time and

134
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,040
devices from,
from a response to time.

135
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:53,930
I need to be here then or this my thing
just pinged me. I need to look at it, uh,

136
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,820
are better able to center themselves to,

137
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,470
to find their own
consciousness and discover who,

138
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,210
who they are and what they
want to be in the world.

139
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:05,570
What does that say about the
self? Do you think? To me.

140
00:08:05,571 --> 00:08:09,710
There's something there about like if
you really believe in the self and your

141
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,560
and the individual and your
ability to overcome things,

142
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,420
you don't need all these external
processes to help define the world because

143
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,580
you're sort of defining it yourself.

144
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:24,850
I agree and I think I do think for me
self sufficiency is one of my highest

145
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,010
values personally and I have a,

146
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:33,100
I have a very hard time understanding
anyone who says Oh if you leave me on my

147
00:08:33,441 --> 00:08:36,770
own I wouldn't know what to do.
Like I, I just don't get this.

148
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:39,650
I don't get why you would maybe want
to lefty thing. I'd be fine too.

149
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,660
I'm like what?
Why would,

150
00:08:41,661 --> 00:08:45,290
why would you broadcast to the
world that you would be helpless?

151
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:47,900
This doesn't make any sense to me but,

152
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,900
and you know there plenty of situations
where I wouldn't know what to do and I

153
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,330
would know what to do in situations that
most people wouldn't just because of

154
00:08:53,331 --> 00:08:54,650
where I've traveled and where I've lived.

155
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,830
But the idea that self
sufficiency required,

156
00:08:58,831 --> 00:09:02,550
the idea that you want to
be self sufficient requires
a concept of self I think

157
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:07,080
is, is important here.
Yeah. Maybe just maybe that.

158
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:12,150
Yeah. And if you give that up, well then
boy you're, you're giving up a lot. You,

159
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,850
you give up so much.
And um,

160
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:19,130
the devices as,
as heroin,

161
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:24,120
as Tristan Harris has argued are addicting
us. It's no accident. We're, you know,

162
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:27,630
we, we should not view
ourselves actually as weak. We,

163
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:31,560
when we get addicted to the
things we should wean ourselves,

164
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:36,030
we should as much as possible
to provide ourselves zones,

165
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:39,600
periods of time when we have
no access to those things.

166
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:44,601
And so we are actually free and clear to
let our minds do what they will because

167
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,730
when, when we, uh, when they
have access to our brands,

168
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,940
they are designed to protect us.
So using,

169
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,370
using the discipline
that you're an expert in,

170
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,760
is it possible that we're in a unique
position right now because of technology

171
00:09:59,641 --> 00:10:04,380
that our brains are actually evolving
now evolving or I guess devolving,

172
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:09,381
depending on which way you look at
it at an extraordinarily high pace or

173
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,730
something like that. You know, the,

174
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:16,230
the rate of change across almost
every sector in the economy,

175
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:19,140
in an human experience right now
is higher than it's ever been.

176
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,060
Could you say that about any
moment in history maybe. Um,

177
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,900
but the rate of change itself
is changing as well, right?

178
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,520
So that's the important
distinction, right? Um,

179
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:34,820
and what is going on with
technology is completely untested.

180
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,910
And so this is, this is a
place where, you know, why,

181
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,340
why am I so certain that
I'm still on the left,

182
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,490
even though most of the people who
say they're on the left publicly,

183
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,120
I don't have any interest in continuing
to talk to them because they don't seem

184
00:10:48,121 --> 00:10:52,500
to be making any sense.
I look at systems that are involved,

185
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:56,640
that are, that are in stable state
because they've evolved over millions,

186
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:58,350
tens of millions,
hundreds of millions of years.

187
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,850
And my instinct is don't mess
with that until you really,

188
00:11:02,851 --> 00:11:06,210
really understand what you're
doing. And so for instance, I,

189
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:09,840
unlike many scientists and
not feeding my children GMOs,

190
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:15,180
I give them and myself organic food
and when we meet, which we do a lot of,

191
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:17,970
I want that meat to
have been fed the grass,

192
00:11:17,971 --> 00:11:22,800
if it's at the food of its ancestors,
what or what exactly is the harm?

193
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,060
We now know a little bit of this,

194
00:11:24,061 --> 00:11:28,230
but 20 years ago if you asked me what's
the harm and feeding cows grands,

195
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:29,370
so I have no idea.

196
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,880
But I know that messing with a system
that was working is more likely to

197
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,810
interfere with something in that
animal then not why, you know,

198
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:42,420
why would you mess if you could not,

199
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:46,410
and of course there are economic
reasons to mess, but um, the,

200
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:50,100
the don't mess with systems that are
working until you really have a solid

201
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:53,590
understanding of what the, what
the effects are going to be. The,

202
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:57,340
the use of the precautionary principle
pretty widely is what puts me pretty far

203
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:02,140
on the left. But systems that we've
created that are evolutionary,

204
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:06,850
but people don't know that we need to
regulate in order to get them under

205
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:10,270
control because nuclear energy
isn't gonna regulate itself.

206
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,740
And habitat loss throughout most of the
world is not going to regulate itself.

207
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:18,010
So there are some problems that we've
created and that are bigger than

208
00:12:18,011 --> 00:12:21,280
individuals can do anything about. And you
know, that's why I'm not a libertarian.

209
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,810
Right. And this is, this is where
I think we have a, I get it.

210
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:29,020
Like I don't know that if you just leave
everybody to do whatever the hell they

211
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:29,591
want all the time,

212
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:31,750
that everybody isn't going to be
doing all sorts of awful things.

213
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:35,290
I think generally the market does fix some
of that. But I get what you're saying.

214
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:39,500
Like these systems are I suppose
often precarious in nature too, right.

215
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:43,180
To the point where anything could be
tilted one way or the other and then we've

216
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,830
got bigger problems. Right? So how do
we, how do we fix some of this stuff?

217
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:51,010
How do we, how do we actually scale
this back? I mean, I get it, you know,

218
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,710
most of my audits we'll get, okay, well
we have to keep talking about it. Sure.

219
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,420
We have to wake more people up.
Sure.

220
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,740
But what can you do using the
knowledge you have and the,

221
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,380
and the study you've done?
I have less,

222
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,850
I have less insight right now at least
to answer in this amount of time, uh,

223
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,870
for the adult systems.
Um,

224
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:13,840
but I think I have a fair amount
of clarity on what we should do,

225
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,200
should be doing with children
and with parenting. We're really,

226
00:13:17,201 --> 00:13:21,280
really not doing a,
which is when you say the adult systems,

227
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:25,870
you mean like economic systems
and, and, and more specifically,

228
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:30,400
how do you get adults who are already,
who they are to behave differently?

229
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,170
Um, it's, it's less clear to me what,

230
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,140
what we can do and so we'll show
them for the purpose of yes. Yes.

231
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:40,940
Also, also, it's true that I have, um,

232
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,930
that I'm not going to wade into a,
for instance,

233
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,210
what we should do about our
economic system here. Now with you.

234
00:13:46,211 --> 00:13:50,800
I might do it later, but
yeah, it's like, okay. Um, but
with regard to, for instance,

235
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:56,470
you know, most, most people I think, I've
never thought about what childhood is.

236
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,590
And if you don't have children
yourself and you're an adult, okay,

237
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:01,240
maybe you don't have to,
maybe it doesn't matter.

238
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:05,110
Like maybe it just doesn't matter to you.
But if you're a parent,

239
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:11,070
you need to think about why it is that
we have literally the longest childhood

240
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,640
relative to lifespan of any organism
on the planet. This is a feature.

241
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,770
This is a way for us to learn how to
become humans. We are not, and this,

242
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,190
this is a point that Brett has made
very often. We're not playing slates,

243
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:29,320
but we are the blankets, slates of
any organisms on the planet. We,

244
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,570
we are more software than hardware.

245
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,160
And so what we're doing for these first,
I don't know,

246
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,030
11 to 25 years of our lives
right now into the forties.

247
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:43,000
I think it depends, but
depending on culture, you know,

248
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:46,030
when do you start calling
yourself an adult? And then, um,

249
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,480
what we're doing is learning how to be
human and we're learning how to be human

250
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,493
by direct X.

251
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:54,830
We're supposed to be learning how
to be human through instruction,

252
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,890
direct instruction by our parents,
through observing our parents,

253
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,680
through observing our siblings,
through interacting with,

254
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,890
including fighting with our siblings
and having them smack us down both

255
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:08,390
sometimes, literally, but
definitely metaphorically
when we do stupid things. And,

256
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:08,720
um,

257
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,260
better yet if our parents have lots of
adult friends around and they have lots

258
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:16,220
of kids and there's a whole mess of
humanity that we are learning from.

259
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,990
And then we're also in that very long
developmental period supposed to be

260
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:23,690
learning from direct physical
experience of the world.

261
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:28,450
So the example I like to go
to here is um, you know, the,

262
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,460
the roadrunner cartoons when Wiley
Coyote scoots is way off a cliff and he

263
00:15:34,551 --> 00:15:38,660
doesn't fall until he realizes there's
nothing below him. It's funny, right?

264
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,620
Like it's really funny.

265
00:15:39,621 --> 00:15:43,370
But of course it's funny because we know
the gravity doesn't really work that

266
00:15:43,371 --> 00:15:44,120
way.
Right?

267
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,120
Increasingly I suspect that a
lot of kids and now into the,

268
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:54,200
and some of the younger
millennials kind of aren't sure,

269
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:59,500
like they were protected so much by
their helicopter parents and they were

270
00:15:59,781 --> 00:16:02,030
behind screens rather than
having real experience.

271
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,010
And to the extent that they played sport,

272
00:16:04,011 --> 00:16:09,011
it was totally regulated and overseen
by adults and they didn't have any free

273
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:12,590
time to go and get themselves into
trouble and maybe even like burn something

274
00:16:12,591 --> 00:16:17,450
down or hurt themselves or break an arm
or whatever it is and learn from it that

275
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:20,150
they arrive at the cusp of what
should have been adulthood.

276
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,970
Totally unclear on what
that supposed to mean.

277
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,740
Does this absolutely to you because as
I'm hearing you say that this is the bell

278
00:16:27,741 --> 00:16:29,060
going off in my head,
man,

279
00:16:29,061 --> 00:16:31,370
I've been on a tour where Peter
soon for the last six weeks,

280
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:36,440
everything that you just said there
is basically what he is saying.

281
00:16:36,441 --> 00:16:41,360
He is trying to, I sent that what he's
trying to do at the most personal level.

282
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:43,040
Yeah.
He talks about society as a whole,

283
00:16:43,041 --> 00:16:47,630
but at the most personal level
he's trying to retool young people.

284
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,130
It's not even retool.

285
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,370
He's trying to give them the tools in
the first place that they clearly should

286
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:53,420
have gotten before.

287
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,430
So that's what's so fascinating to me
because it's like how did this happen?

288
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,910
Right? How did, how did this happen?
And, you know, we can point to,

289
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:07,550
we can point to pharmaceuticals being
given to kids to make boys less boy alike

290
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,790
and to some degree to make girls
last girl like, you know, give great,

291
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:15,680
let's give speed to boys. So they'll
serve and face forward and learn what.

292
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,400
So they'll calm down, calm down
and not do rough and tumble play.

293
00:17:19,401 --> 00:17:21,410
And I mean that's insane.

294
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:26,770
And at the same time let's
give antianxiety meds to
girls and Ssri wise and um,

295
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,730
and you know, just, just
the model of schooling is
ridiculous. You know, we have,

296
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,740
we have schools that have gotten rid of
recess because recess is dangerous and

297
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:40,220
everyone who's ever been in school,
even if like me,

298
00:17:40,221 --> 00:17:43,310
you happen to have been a good fit for
the model of schools that you were in,

299
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,110
which I think is pretty rare,

300
00:17:45,111 --> 00:17:50,111
actually knows that you also need to
have time to get out there and play and

301
00:17:50,581 --> 00:17:54,930
move your body and experience it and
not have it being overseen by some adult

302
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:58,470
who's decided in advance. What isn't,
is not safe for you to experience.

303
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:02,120
So know one of the things I used to say
to my students in advance, you know,

304
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:06,060
I did a lot of team building and like
actual team building and planning with

305
00:18:06,061 --> 00:18:07,860
them in advance of these
lung study abroad trips.

306
00:18:07,861 --> 00:18:11,610
We would have spent weeks together on
campus in advance of going on these trips.

307
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:12,810
Um,

308
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,640
but what I wanted to do before we
left was established with them.

309
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,390
What's your relationship with risk?
How do you, how do you view yourself,

310
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,940
your relationship with risk?
And we would do this in round like,

311
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:26,760
and I would answer the question too
and you know, I would say to them,

312
00:18:26,761 --> 00:18:29,160
actually I happen to love risk.
I will,

313
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:32,580
I am the leader on this trip
but I will keep all of you safe.

314
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:34,760
But then I'm going to go
do things and you know,

315
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,930
I am going to walk alone in the forest a
lot and do things because it happens to

316
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:42,600
be one of the ways that I
find my consciousness that I,

317
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:47,430
that I find my truest self. And I don't
expect any of you to do that also,

318
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,680
but you need to be comfortable with the
fact that your leader is going to be

319
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:50,700
doing that sort of thing.

320
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,850
And one of the other things that we
were talking about was, you know,

321
00:18:53,851 --> 00:18:56,490
what's your relationship with comfort?
Or you're going to be uncomfortable.

322
00:18:56,491 --> 00:19:00,180
You're gonna have to, you know,
just because you can say in advance,

323
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:05,040
you're okay with the bugs and the mud
and the not having a phone doesn't mean

324
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:07,120
you actually will be when
you're faced with it. Uh,

325
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:12,320
but maybe most important is we are going
to leave ourselves open to serendipity.

326
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,620
I cannot tell you everything that we're
going to do or learn on this trip.

327
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:18,480
If I could,
what would be the point of going,

328
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:22,980
we're going to go and some interesting
things are gonna happen. I've,

329
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,150
I've had a couple of near
death experiences on these
trips. I didn't want them.

330
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,840
I didn't, you know, I, I, and you know, I,

331
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:33,360
I was always been a learning experience
where there's a learning experience and

332
00:19:33,361 --> 00:19:35,850
frankly on the, on, on
the most recent one on a,

333
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,650
on a boat in the Galapagos with eight
students in which the only thing that

334
00:19:40,651 --> 00:19:44,310
didn't survive was the boat. But it
was, it was really touch and go. I mean,

335
00:19:44,311 --> 00:19:46,080
I really did almost die.

336
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,860
Those eight students and I are friends
for life. Right. You know, there's,

337
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,740
there's some of them that I'm
not an active contact with,

338
00:19:52,741 --> 00:19:55,230
but I know where they are and that,
you know,

339
00:19:55,231 --> 00:19:58,200
that bonds you and no,

340
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:03,150
I'm not going to pitch a trip with Andy
might die. That's not what the goal is.

341
00:20:03,151 --> 00:20:08,151
But the idea that it could happen and
you should have the tools on board,

342
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,610
the physical tools, the psychological
tools, the emotional tools,

343
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,640
intellectual tools to figure out in real
time as your boat is being flipped by a

344
00:20:16,831 --> 00:20:21,420
15 foot wave and now you're
trapped under it. What do you do?

345
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:26,070
Was that a uniquely
Evergreen type of teaching?

346
00:20:26,071 --> 00:20:27,960
Was that something that
you and Brett really,

347
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:31,530
that was a unique name there me kind
of teaching. And then this last trip,

348
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:35,790
Brett was there with me as
well. There was, there was
a way in which I think what,

349
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,910
you know what I said about
childhood, which I, you know,

350
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,690
my interest originally and evolution
was about the evolution of parental care

351
00:20:42,691 --> 00:20:45,120
and territoriality and social
systems and sexual selection.

352
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:50,080
And long before I ever had kids,
my cell phone before I wanted kids,

353
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:52,110
but I thought no one spread.

354
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:56,620
And I did have kids and I'm watching
these amazing creatures began to grow up.

355
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,470
Okay,
let's think then about what,

356
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,620
what is the best way to do this?

357
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:08,100
And we could put them a little boxes and
make absolutely sure that they survive

358
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:13,060
till the age of 18 and then we opened up
the boxes and we let them out and they

359
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:18,061
have basically no chance at being adults
or even of knowing how to be adults or

360
00:21:18,221 --> 00:21:22,210
we could expose them to ever greater risk.

361
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:28,540
Having first made absolutely sure that
they know that they are loved and that we

362
00:21:28,541 --> 00:21:32,620
have their backs and that we will do
anything to come in and get them and to

363
00:21:32,621 --> 00:21:34,360
protect them if we can,

364
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:38,020
but that they are going to start going
out into the world pretty early. You know,

365
00:21:38,021 --> 00:21:39,960
biking it too.
And you know,

366
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:44,970
we took them to the Amazon at seven and
nine the first time and young something

367
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,560
could've gone wrong and I don't know,

368
00:21:47,830 --> 00:21:51,430
I've known parents who lost kids and
I don't know how you survive that,

369
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:56,910
but you need to be willing to take risks
such that when your kids do hit 18 or

370
00:21:57,431 --> 00:21:58,360
20 or whatever,

371
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,660
you know that they're actually
already on their way to being adults.

372
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,000
And that is going to require backing
off and letting them do some of their

373
00:22:07,001 --> 00:22:10,210
learning on their own and knowing that
that's going to result in some harm

374
00:22:10,211 --> 00:22:12,160
coming to them and it's
going to be physical harm.

375
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:15,490
It's going to be psychological harm,
it's going to be intellectual harm.

376
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,371
But frankly,
the,

377
00:22:16,371 --> 00:22:20,530
the lack of any kind of harm that a lot
of kids are experiencing is part of why

378
00:22:20,531 --> 00:22:23,440
they're now saying speech is
violence. Yeah. Right. I mean that's,

379
00:22:23,441 --> 00:22:24,850
that's part of how we get there

380
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,360
is some of this an extension of
the success of the West in a way.

381
00:22:30,491 --> 00:22:34,210
Because if you take the,
this set of kids who however old they are,

382
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,350
let's say we go from,

383
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,690
although now there's a lot of
studies that are showing that young,

384
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:41,560
the generation younger than millennials
is actually leaning more conservative.

385
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:45,100
But let's say we take 16 to 30 roughly.
Yeah.

386
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,840
So generation y ish,

387
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,740
but you see that most of their parents
were baby boomers who were the most

388
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:54,730
successful, at least financially
generation ever. Most of the baby boomers,

389
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:56,920
parents all went to war and right.
You know,

390
00:22:56,921 --> 00:22:58,780
live through depression
and all sorts of stuff,

391
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,950
but that because the baby
boomer is basically where
the biggest middleclass and

392
00:23:02,951 --> 00:23:06,070
because there was such upward mobility,
they added so well,

393
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,900
they kinda got their eye off the ball,

394
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,840
started focusing on things
that didn't matter as much,

395
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:14,920
protecting kids from things that a kid
would have used to have to have done.

396
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,810
And that is sort of what led us here.

397
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:21,360
So it's almost like an economic
backing for what ended up happening

398
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,210
psychologically.

399
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,200
Yeah. I think, I think
that's apt. You know,

400
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:27,020
there's so many things
feeding into this and yes,

401
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:30,110
the wealth of America Post World War II,
uh,

402
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:34,370
and the fact that those are most
of the parents of the generation,

403
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:38,660
that seems the most confused. I think
definitely there's a causal link there.

404
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,620
Yeah. And then you toss into the
Internet and you toss on the Internet,

405
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:48,290
right. Um, which, you know,
we can't go back obviously.

406
00:23:48,710 --> 00:23:49,970
Uh,
but,

407
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,680
but we need to understand that it's an
evolutionary system and then it's going

408
00:23:54,681 --> 00:23:59,681
to run away from us and that we are all
prone to be addicted to dopamine hits.

409
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:06,560
We're going to seek the quick,
quick likes rather than,

410
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:10,520
you know, even even. Okay. So take
internet out of the picture for a moment.

411
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:16,130
If you don't know what you do for physical
activity, I bike you play basketball.

412
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,330
Okay. So maybe with basketball it's
going to be different. Uh, for me,

413
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,470
I like video games too. Is that
better? No, that's probably,

414
00:24:24,471 --> 00:24:26,890
probably probably the opposite.
But,

415
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,830
so I used to play a lot of
ultimate frisbee and you
could like anytime there was

416
00:24:30,831 --> 00:24:33,740
a pickup game, like I would, I,
I'm, I'm there. I was playing five,

417
00:24:33,741 --> 00:24:35,320
six times a week for awhile.
Um,

418
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,450
and then I ruptured my Achilles tendon
playing on an Oregon beach with students

419
00:24:38,451 --> 00:24:42,860
a few years ago. I'm not doing
that anymore. Um, but biking,

420
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,810
which I love and I find meditative,

421
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,330
I have a very hard time convincing myself
to get on my bike even though while

422
00:24:50,331 --> 00:24:52,610
I'm doing it, I love
it. And after I do it,

423
00:24:52,611 --> 00:24:57,170
I feel better and I'm more productive
and a more creative and I just am,

424
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,580
you know,
more in love with life,

425
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:04,040
but it's a pain in the ass and it's a
little bit physically uncomfortable.

426
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:07,190
And you know, all of
these things are true. We,

427
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:12,410
we prioritize the pleasure of now
over even something that for me,

428
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:15,950
I know not, it's not even that I'm
going to feel better after I did it.

429
00:25:15,951 --> 00:25:17,420
I actually love the activity itself,

430
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:22,280
but getting over that sort of
activation energy to do the thing.

431
00:25:22,281 --> 00:25:26,150
And I suspect that sport, like actual
team sports is a little bit different,

432
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,880
a little different. Like you're ready
to go. You ready to go? Like, oh,

433
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,030
people are there, I'm ready. I'll like,
let's, let's do it. Going to the gym,

434
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,640
I would like into that.
Like I know that when I work out,

435
00:25:34,641 --> 00:25:38,180
I like doing it and I feel great after,
but it's like, oh, I gotta get in my car,

436
00:25:38,181 --> 00:25:40,430
I got to drive over there and I
got a bark, or blah, blah, blah.

437
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:44,080
It feels like a chore, but yet,
you know, it's good. And yet,

438
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:47,480
so we're always fighting our nature
sort of. We are. No, exactly.

439
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:50,540
We're always fighting or nature and it
shouldn't surprise us that we're going to

440
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:55,040
need to fight our nature with regard
to responding to the Internet and

441
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,083
responding to,

442
00:25:56,150 --> 00:26:01,100
especially especially the little computers
we carry around in our pockets and

443
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:01,640
you know,

444
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:06,640
learning to restrict our access to
those training ourselves to restrict our

445
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:07,581
access to those.

446
00:26:07,581 --> 00:26:11,960
And I think anyone with the ability to
train themselves to meditate or to do

447
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:13,550
anything on a regular basis should,

448
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,440
should be able to train themselves that
same way with regard to devices. Yeah.

449
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:18,891
All right,

450
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:23,180
well we've done about an hour here and
I am going to demand that you come back

451
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:23,721
because I know,

452
00:26:23,721 --> 00:26:26,330
I know we can do way more
of this unfortunately just
because my schedule is so

453
00:26:26,331 --> 00:26:28,380
nuts at the moment. We,
we have to kind of stuff.

454
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,700
But can you give me one more thing that
you're just really excited about right

455
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:35,180
now that you've been thinking about or
working on or anything else that's really

456
00:26:35,181 --> 00:26:36,710
just giving you a little bit,
uh,

457
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,430
a little bit of juice at the moment while
you're in this interesting space for

458
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:45,060
yourself? No. Um, there are a number
of things I guess. Um, there's a,

459
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,480
there's a piece I wrote a number of years
ago that is supposed to be out in the

460
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,310
literary magazine just about now,

461
00:26:50,311 --> 00:26:54,180
ash about haven't been mugged
at knife point and Quito,

462
00:26:54,181 --> 00:26:57,060
one of these on one of these
study abroad trips. Um,

463
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,050
which prompt and I was with
three students, Quito, the
capital of Ecuador. Okay.

464
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,630
So it was,
it was the very,

465
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,960
it was before the first day of one
of my six weeks study abroad trips.

466
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:10,950
I was a 20 students just made,
Brett wasn't there on this one. Um,

467
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:16,020
and the experience in
which, you know, we've been,

468
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,450
we've been to get the three students
that I have been together all day.

469
00:27:18,451 --> 00:27:23,060
We come to the top of the stairs
and suddenly two guys with,

470
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:27,750
with knives run around the corner and
pin me and my female student up against a

471
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:31,530
wall and do this sort of knife dance
in front of us and then relieve.

472
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,770
I didn't have anything on me because I
know how to walk around Latin American

473
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:36,720
cities and one of my students didn't.

474
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,300
But two of my students had all
of their stuff taken off them,

475
00:27:39,301 --> 00:27:42,960
including this really nice DSLR
that that Michelle my student had.

476
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,100
And
they run off.

477
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,790
And the next thing I realize I am on
one of these guys in the middle of the

478
00:27:53,341 --> 00:27:56,760
street pulling on the backpack. He's
stolen from another one of my students.

479
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,580
Another one of my students has
chased down the other guy. Wow.

480
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,960
And thought,

481
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,450
how did that happen and why is
everything now so loud and so colorful?

482
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,690
And I thought back immediately thought,
wow,

483
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:14,691
the entire experience that I just had
was somehow in black and white and was

484
00:28:15,631 --> 00:28:18,090
without sound.
And so,

485
00:28:18,091 --> 00:28:20,640
I mean it's an interesting
long story that,

486
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,080
that I basically explored in
this essay by going into doing,

487
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:26,490
doing a dive into the literature
on the nature of memory,

488
00:28:26,491 --> 00:28:30,330
on the nature of sensory memory in
particular and what it is that we can and

489
00:28:30,331 --> 00:28:34,350
cannot perceive in the moment,
what our brands take in,

490
00:28:34,351 --> 00:28:36,120
why time seems to slow down.

491
00:28:36,121 --> 00:28:38,100
So just to go back to our
earlier conversation about time,

492
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:42,150
why tea time seems to slow
down in periods of intensity.

493
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:43,920
It's not that it time slows down,

494
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:47,850
but basically our frame rate increases
and not only our frame rate increases but

495
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,630
the amount that we remember and you know,
move into short term memory.

496
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:55,260
And then in this case into longterm
memory increases. So this is,

497
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:59,040
this is one of the things that I've been
thinking about lately is sort of how,

498
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,730
how memory and the senses and in fact
how all of us are a little bit of

499
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,390
synesthesia. It's are experiencing
our world in ways that,

500
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:08,640
that we don't usually have language for.

501
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:12,180
Now that it was the purpose of the story.
But how did this all end? It ended.

502
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:13,940
We got, we got the stuff back. Wow.

503
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:18,720
We got the stuff back and
as soon as the student,

504
00:29:18,721 --> 00:29:22,200
Jeremy and I give [inaudible] Tracy
these guys and got the stuff back,

505
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,310
then the police showed up.

506
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:28,970
Then the pleaser got blurred up from
the island and the whole watching I,

507
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,820
it was, it was remarkable actually. It was
totally, there was no one on this walk.

508
00:29:32,821 --> 00:29:36,960
We'd send no one. These two guys
run up to us, Mug us, run off,

509
00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:40,380
we give chase, and then the
entire neighborhood comes alive.

510
00:29:40,381 --> 00:29:42,010
Suddenly there were hundreds of

511
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:45,840
people there like,
where were you guys there?

512
00:29:45,930 --> 00:29:47,830
There's some sort of study
to be done on that. Well,

513
00:29:47,831 --> 00:29:49,060
I'm sure they've done studies on that.
You know,

514
00:29:49,061 --> 00:29:50,950
when people see the bad thing happening,

515
00:29:50,951 --> 00:29:53,380
but nobody calls the police and
all that kinda stuff. Well, listen,

516
00:29:53,381 --> 00:29:54,340
it's been an absolute pleasure.

517
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:58,030
I'm so glad that we finally got to do
this in person and we will do it again.

518
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:02,650
And you guys can follow Heather on the
Twitter. She does tweet a decent amount,

519
00:30:02,651 --> 00:30:07,000
but not a unhealthy addicted amount.
I would say it's at Heather.

520
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:07,690
He hiding.
