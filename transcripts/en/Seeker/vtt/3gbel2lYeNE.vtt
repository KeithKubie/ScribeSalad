00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.880
All over the world, the remnants of war are
still laying around.

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.500
Not just abandoned missile sites, or cold
war bunkers, but actual munitions.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:18.830
How long are they going to be a danger?

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.539
When I was Boy Scout, we used to go to military
bases and stay in old the World War II barracks.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.880
Once in a while, the guys and I would find
live rounds, and once, a dud grenade!

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.880
Obviously, we secretly tried to keep them,
but when the adults inevitably discovered

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.970
what we'd found, a safety conversation unavoidably
ensued; but is there a real concern?

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:40.980
Are old explosives dangerous?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.210
The first explosives were invented in China
in the tenth century when someone found the

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.171
mixture of potassium nitrate, charcoal and
sulfur exploded with an energetic force, we

00:00:50.171 --> 00:00:54.750
call it "black powder" because Europeans later
converted it into a weapon of war.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.300
The 19th century, saw a flurry of explosive
chemicals including nitroglycerin, dynamite,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.600
and smokeless gunpowder.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.229
Dynamite, invented by Alfred Nobel -- founder
of the Nobel prizes -- is a high explosive.

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.740
It's highly unstable nitroglycerin mixed with
clay, wood or some other inert agent.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.689
Before the invention of dynamite, most explosives
were either relatively slow burning; great

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.329
for projectiles like fireworks, but not useful
for blowing things up -- these are called

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:20.630
low explosives.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.830
Low explosives burn and at their surface,
slowly in thousands of a second; whereas high

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.280
explosives ignite throughout their composition,
very rapidly (millionths of a second).

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.840
Dynamite was one of the first popular high
explosives, and was so good at blowing stuff

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.590
up, it became popular in mining, construction,
demolition, and (of course) military.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.100
In movies, high explosives often require a
very plot-important detonator.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.030
These are called primary explosives, and are
used with certain high explosives that require

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.679
more OOMF to ignite.

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.030
C4, for example, is one of those.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.499
C4 is relatively inert until it's hit with
a primary explosive.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.630
C4 can be lit on fire and will not detonate,
but will instead burn like a piece of wood

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.109
-- though it emits poisonous gas so don't
try that with C4 at home.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:10.190
If you, however, hit C4 with an electrical
charge or another primary explosive, be somewhere

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.190
else.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.370
As explosives age, they go through chemical
changes which can make them less effective

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.590
and less predictable.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.330
Ammonium nitrate explosives like ANFO will
absorb moisture, become damp and thus less

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.980
effective; nitroglycerin explosives like TNT
or dynamite can degrade in warm climates or

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.310
even excess sunlight!

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.470
Explosives have expiration dates ranging from
a few months for slurry explosives to many

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.860
years for detonators and cast explosives -- but
unlike food, it's not that the explosive becomes

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.950
a dud, it just may not explode with maximum
efficiency.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.010
For example, the M16 land mine was produced
by the U.S. from World War II into the mid-70s

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.260
and uses trinitrotoluene (TNT) explosive to
bound into the air and explode into a 30 meter

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.260
radius.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.040
It has a 70% chance of going off properly
after 8 years underground, 12 in tropical

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
climes.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.090
And yet, 50 years later, the chemicals inside
of mines might have degraded, but they're

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.710
still very deadly.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:18.340
Today, improvised explosive devices and car
bombs get the most news, but 2013 saw a bit

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.160
less than 11,500 civilians killed by these
methods.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.040
Unfortunately, the wars of the last century,
left 78 countries scattered with over 100

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.310
million landmines, which still kill 15 to
20,000 people every year according to the

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.791
U.N. Landmines have been banned by international
treaties, and a 1980 Geneva Convention, but

00:03:37.791 --> 00:03:39.090
they're still out there.

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.060
Cluster bombs and landmines are often dropped
from airplanes or shot across large areas

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.540
by artillery, and are therefore never located
on a map and were never recovered.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.610
In fact, there are an estimated 80 million
potentially active bombs littering the country

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:53.040
of Laos ALONE.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.130
For more about explosives on the ground; Lissette
and Seeker Daily have a story about the woman

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:11.290
fighting to find these deadly mines.

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.960
But for the full experience, you have to also
watch this video on TestTube (point to 2nd

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:15.960
video).

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:23.979
Where Evan explores how these mines got everywhere,
and why we haven't cleaned 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.909
them up.
