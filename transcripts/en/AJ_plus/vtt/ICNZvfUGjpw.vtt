00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
Before California was the land of bits, bytes and binary, it was filled with

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:07.820
fields and people growing fruit, vegetables and flowers.

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.540
My family's history in this area dates back to pre-World War II,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.920
[I] had my great-grandfather in the area and my grandfather and my dad, and now myself.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.010
And the early stars of California agriculture were Japanese-Americans

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.220
like Haruo Hayashi, whose family owned a farm in Arroyo Grande.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.320
But even though Japanese-Americans put food on the nation’s table,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.700
they still faced discrimination from their neighbors and their government.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:39.880
Next day, after Pearl Harbor, the FBI came in and took all the heads of the family.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.399
Hey guys, I’m Shreen, and this Sunday we’ve traded the studio for the fields

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
to talk about how Japanese-Americans helped feed America and the struggles they faced along the way.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.060
This is what you will see in a grocery
store, wrapped in plastic wrap.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.820
Four generations of this Japanese-American family have been farming in Arroyo Grande for decades.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.890
My grandfather came from Japan early 1900s. He was 15 years old.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.380
He's farmed up and down the California coast, and he came here in the 1920s to this area.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.680
The Kobarras were just one of thousands of Japanese-American families that historian Donna Graves

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.380
says were instrumental in shaping California agriculture in the early 20th century.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.380
California became the breadbasket for the United States in the early 20th century, and immigrant labor

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.180
was incredibly important to that, especially the work of Japanese-American farmers

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.080
Japan had been closed to trade with the West from the 1600s until the late 1800s.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.710
The country’s custom of leaving an inheritance to the eldest son meant

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
there were many young Japanese men who were ready to seek their fortunes elsewhere.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.260
And the U.S. was in need of laborers.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.800
Japanese immigrants had a chance to lay their roots after the U.S.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.000
implemented a discriminatory policy aimed at curbing Chinese immigration.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.880
The 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act cut off a really important source of labor

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.140
for California, and Japanese immigrants stepped in to fill that gap.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.120
Japanese immigrants took many paths to the U.S. Some came through South America,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.080
others through Hawaii (at the time a U.S. territory).

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:31.540
Japanese-Americans really exploited the possibilities for intensively farming small pieces of land

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.440
that were near urban areas. They were willing to do the hard work

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.880
of creating a really robust crop on a plot of land and then getting it to market.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.020
My grandfather actually came over to Hawaii first on a contract to harbor sugarcane.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.420
Once that contract was up, he came over to California and harvested,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.420
I think, sugar beets for the Holly Sugar Company,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.280
then also kind of became somewhat of a migrant farm worker, traveling up and down the state with the crops.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.440
Japanese-Americans quickly became involved in all aspects of agriculture,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.960
from preparing the fields to sowing seeds and bringing produce to market.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:17.640
During the] recession time in the 1930s, we were growing a lot of peas.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.140
They’ve grown pretty much every type of vegetable.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.860
Different types of lettuces, iceberg, green leaf, Romaine lettuces,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.140
green cabbage, red cabbage, spinach, cilantro, parsley, celery, broccoli.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.100
Asian vegetables, Chinese Napa, cabbage, bok choy and baby bok choy.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.320
Despite being in demand as workers, Japanese farmers faced major obstacles.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.480
Japanese-American farmers were both admired and reviled for their success.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.380
White farmers needed them on their farms to make them productive,

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.480
but they resented the success that Japanese immigrant farmers were beginning to enjoy,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.840
and it fed into a long-standing tradition of anti-Asian sentiment on the West Coast.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.960
A 1913 Alien Land Law blocked first-generation Japanese immigrants from owning land,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.340
because they couldn't become U.S. citizens.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.760
My grandfather, they had money when the peas were good, and during the Depression

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.140
and people were selling some of their ground, and at that time he bought it,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:27.320
put the name in his oldest child,
which was my aunt who was 8 or 10,

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.400
something like that, but she was still a
child.

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:35.640
After the 1913 Alien Land Law, anti-Japanese sentiment didn't decline,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:42.460
and by 1920 a new law was passed that restricted the ability of American-born children

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.600
of Japanese immigrants owning property.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:51.260
So the vice on Japanese-Americans owning property was becoming more tight.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:56.420
But Japanese farmers still grew nearly 40% of the produce in California by 1940,

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.640
despite the anti-Japanese legislation.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.800
Then came World War II. President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.200
that authorized relocating Japanese-Americans to internment camps.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.860
The evacuation of more than a 100,000 men, women and children,

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.260
all of Japanese ancestry, removed from their homes in the Pacific coast states to wartime communities.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.040
It wasn't a good feeling, because there are three or four of your best friend was white friend.

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.260
[They] was over here and, you know, they didn't get moved out or anything.

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.980
We were pretty good friends.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.400
Farmers had to abandon their crops. $22 million worth of produce was left in the field.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.700
But it didn’t go to waste. The government stepped in to harvest the needed produce,

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.620
but the farmers weren’t compensated.

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:51.500
The very large proportion of Japanese-American tenant farmers who didn't own their property were subject

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:58.840
to a new program that was run by the Wartime Civil Control Administration that took their land,

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:04.480
their farms, their equipment, and transferred it to the hands of white Americans

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.040
who were not being rounded up.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.740
Japanese workers continued to farm even after they were incarcerated.

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.740
Inmate labor was used to keep camps running, doing everything from growing food to teaching children.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:24.860
We furnished all the labor to keep the thing going. And got paid $7 a month.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.960
The average wage in 1942 was $156 per month.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:36.400
During the latter years of being in camps, college-age people were allowed to go to college

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:42.360
in the interior [of the U.S.]. My father finished up at Tulsa, my mother in Chicago

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.960
so Japanese got spread all over the place.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.720
The people that didn't have things to come back to basically stayed where they were.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.240
After the war, many Japanese had no homes to return to.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.080
And most that had owned land had sold it before being incarcerated.

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.160
But a few were able to resume farming, thanks to the generosity of neighbors

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.880
who had cared for their property and returned it after the war.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:08.940
My grandfather, he was a very sharp man 'cause he said that if we left everything to one person,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.080
he didn't know what would happen.
So he left the trucks with one person,

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:16.740
the farming equipment and the land with our neighbor here and the animals, the horses

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.240
that they use for some other work, to another person. When they came back, they had everything

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.700
except the horses .

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:27.440
Even those who came back faced an uphill battle.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.760
My grandfather was actually the first person back here in the San Luis County

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.320
And they had sleep in this house that we’re at now, in the hallways,

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:42.400
because they were afraid of being too close to a window in case bullets came through the window.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.400
Because there were shots being fired up in the air. They had it a little tough.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:54.200
When they came back, they were cash-poor. And so it was good people in the community

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:59.140
that extended credit that allowed our families to establish themselves again.

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.240
The Ikedas, Hayashis and Kobarras, along with others, relied on this collective

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.880
to continue their farming in an often hostile climate and compete against larger farms.

00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.200
Meanwhile, corporate agriculture was swallowing up small farms,

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.100
and the state was losing farmland to urban development.

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.420
These days, many Japanese-Americans are far removed from farming,

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:19.860
choosing instead to pursue professional careers.

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.320
Brycen Ikeda is continuing his family’s legacy.

00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:28.360
I do have two kids of my own, and I’d love to see them have the opportunity to have the farming lifestyle.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.540
I'm really family centric. Family breakfastes, spending time with the family,

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.020
and if the farming [is] something they enjoy, I'd push them in that direction

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.860
but I'd hate to have them do something that they don't love.

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:43.800
And most family farms don't make it past three generations.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:49.540
For you to be in an area for this long and put down roots in the same industry,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:51.160
I think we've been very fortunate.

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.980
Thanks for watching. This story is really about resilience in immigrant communities in America,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.500
And we'll be following other immigrant groups for the next few weeks.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:05.200
