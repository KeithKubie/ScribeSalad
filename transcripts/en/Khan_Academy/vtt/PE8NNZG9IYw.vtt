00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.940
- [Instructor] The table
gives selected values

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.980
of the differentiable function f.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.060
All right, can we use
the mean value theorem

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.300
to say that there is a value
c such that f prime of c

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:13.030
is equal to five and c
is between four and six?

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.300
If so, write a justification.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.000
Well it meets, to meet the,
to use the mean value theorem,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.250
you have to be differentiable
over the open interval

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.630
and continuous over the closed interval,

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.000
so it seems like we've met that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.880
Because if you're
differentiable over an interval,

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670
you're definitely continuous
over that interval.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.820
It's saying that it's just
a generally differentiable

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.500
function f I guess over any interval.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.080
But the next part is to say,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.060
all right, if that condition is met,

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.680
then the slope of the secant line

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.941
between four comma f of
four and six comma f of six,

00:00:43.941 --> 00:00:48.100
that some at least one point
in between four and six

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.860
will have a derivative that is equal

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.410
to the slope of the secant line.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.750
And so let's figure out what the slope

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.890
of the secant line is
between four comma f of four

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.290
and six comma f of six.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.090
And if it's equal to five,

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.140
then we could use the mean value theorem.

00:01:02.076 --> 00:01:02.909
If it's not equal to five,

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:04.040
then the mean value
theorem would not apply.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.410
And so let's do that.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.600
f of six minus f of four,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
all of that over six
minus four is equal to

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:13.910
seven minus three

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.130
over two, which is equal to two.

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.270
So two not equal to five.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.853
So mean value theorem doesn't apply.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.237
All right let's, I'll
put an exclamation mark

00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:31.410
there for emphasis.

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.650
All right let's do the next part.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.972
Can we use the mean value theorem to say

00:01:34.972 --> 00:01:36.650
that the equation f prime of
x is equal to negative one

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.620
has a solution?

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.300
And now the interval's from zero to two.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.140
If so, write a justification.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.650
All right so let's see this.

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.940
So if we were to take the
slope of the secant line,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.160
so f of two minus f of zero,

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.070
all that over two minus zero.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.993
This is equal to negative two minus zero,

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.380
all of that over two,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.770
which is equal to negative two over two,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.400
which is equal to negative one.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.250
And so and we also know that we meet

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.660
the continuity and
differentiability conditions,

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.280
and so we could say and since

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.800
f is generally differentiable,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.483
generally differentiable,

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:20.593
differentiable,

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.470
it will be

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.767
differentiable, differentiable,

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.620
and, and continuous

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.680
over the interval from zero to two,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.620
and I'll say the closed interval.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.590
You just have to be differentiable
over the open interval,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.720
but it's even better I guess
if you're differentiable

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.510
over the closed interval because
you have to be continuous

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.920
over the closed interval.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.330
And so, and since f is
generally differentiable,

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.200
it will be differentiable
and continuous over zero two.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.130
So the mean value theorem tells us,

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.980
tells us, that there

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.610
is an x

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.960
in that interval from zero to two

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.130
such that

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.260
f prime of x

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.730
is equal to that secant slope,

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.560
or you could say that
average rate of change,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.700
is equal to negative one.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.970
And so I could write,

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.510
yes, yes, and then this
would be my justification.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.150
This is the slope of the secant line

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.430
or the average rate of change,

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.490
and since f is generally differentiable,

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.360
it will be differentiable and continuous

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:31.560
over the closed interval.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.570
So the mean value theorem tells us

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.930
that there is an x in this interval

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.780
such that f prime of x
is equal to negative one.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:40.613
And we're done.
