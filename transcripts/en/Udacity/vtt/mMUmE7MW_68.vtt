00:00:00.338 --> 00:00:03.420
So far we've seen that the set of
strings over any finite alphabet

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:04.720
is countable.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.980
How about the set of all languages?

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.220
Here is an attempted proof that
shows that the set of languages

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.330
over an alphabet is countable.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.320
Indicate the steps that
you think are incorrect.
