00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:56.779
carrots and sticks approach which is
something you want to avoid this is

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789
something you want to avoid this is
 

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:59.149
something you want to avoid this is
things like rewards badges time pressure

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159
things like rewards badges time pressure
 

00:06:59.159 --> 00:07:00.559
things like rewards badges time pressure
those kinds of things that get people to

00:07:00.559 --> 00:07:00.569
those kinds of things that get people to
 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:03.200
those kinds of things that get people to
take actions it's not that rewards can't

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:03.210
take actions it's not that rewards can't
 

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:05.269
take actions it's not that rewards can't
be an important part of motivation but

00:07:05.269 --> 00:07:05.279
be an important part of motivation but
 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:07.070
be an important part of motivation but
they have to be subordinate to people

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.080
they have to be subordinate to people
 

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.689
they have to be subordinate to people
having a personal narrative if there's

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:08.699
having a personal narrative if there's
 

00:07:08.699 --> 00:07:10.189
having a personal narrative if there's
something they want to accomplish and

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199
something they want to accomplish and
 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.899
something they want to accomplish and
they take meaningful steps towards that

00:07:11.899 --> 00:07:11.909
they take meaningful steps towards that
 

00:07:11.909 --> 00:07:14.239
they take meaningful steps towards that
and you reward them that's awesome if

00:07:14.239 --> 00:07:14.249
and you reward them that's awesome if
 

00:07:14.249 --> 00:07:16.159
and you reward them that's awesome if
they don't have that personal narrative

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:16.169
they don't have that personal narrative
 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.179
they don't have that personal narrative
and essentially you're trying to

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:17.189
and essentially you're trying to
 

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:19.549
and essentially you're trying to
generate actions all through carrots and

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:19.559
generate actions all through carrots and
 

00:07:19.559 --> 00:07:21.760
generate actions all through carrots and
sticks that's gonna lead to short-term

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770
sticks that's gonna lead to short-term
 

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.559
sticks that's gonna lead to short-term
improvement in behavior but midterm and

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:24.569
improvement in behavior but midterm and
 

00:07:24.569 --> 00:07:26.450
improvement in behavior but midterm and
long-term problems and so it's important

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:26.460
long-term problems and so it's important
 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:28.639
long-term problems and so it's important
which foundation you're building on the

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:28.649
which foundation you're building on the
 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:30.499
which foundation you're building on the
last thing is is when possible you want

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:30.509
last thing is is when possible you want
 

00:07:30.509 --> 00:07:32.119
last thing is is when possible you want
to provide meaningful choices about how

00:07:32.119 --> 00:07:32.129
to provide meaningful choices about how
 

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:34.999
to provide meaningful choices about how
to interact with the app like what value

00:07:34.999 --> 00:07:35.009
to interact with the app like what value
 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:36.499
to interact with the app like what value
they get out of things because

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:36.509
they get out of things because
 

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.089
they get out of things because
essentially if people get choices then

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:38.099
essentially if people get choices then
 

00:07:38.099 --> 00:07:39.290
essentially if people get choices then
obviously it's easier for them to

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300
obviously it's easier for them to
 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.999
obviously it's easier for them to
endorse the path to run because they're

00:07:40.999 --> 00:07:41.009
endorse the path to run because they're
 

00:07:41.009 --> 00:07:43.959
endorse the path to run because they're
helping to design what their experiences

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:43.969

can't use it then obviously they fail at
high rates so during development one of

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:55.170
high rates so during development one of
 

00:09:55.170 --> 00:09:56.480
high rates so during development one of
the things that we see people have the

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:56.490
the things that we see people have the
 

00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:57.860
the things that we see people have the
most trouble with is when giving

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:57.870
most trouble with is when giving
 

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:01.010
most trouble with is when giving
feedback to users as it's important to

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:01.020
feedback to users as it's important to
 

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.530
feedback to users as it's important to
be informational rather than judgemental

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:03.540
be informational rather than judgemental
 

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.600
be informational rather than judgemental
so let's say that I'm picking up an

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.610
so let's say that I'm picking up an
 

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.760
so let's say that I'm picking up an
exercise app and I instantly don't know

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:07.770
exercise app and I instantly don't know
 

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:08.690
exercise app and I instantly don't know
how to do a push-up

00:10:08.690 --> 00:10:08.700
how to do a push-up
 

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.090
how to do a push-up
which is likely then if you essentially

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100
which is likely then if you essentially
 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.250
which is likely then if you essentially
flashed a big red light and say you have

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260
flashed a big red light and say you have
 

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.520
flashed a big red light and say you have
failed that push-up that makes me feel

00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:15.530
failed that push-up that makes me feel
 

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.660
failed that push-up that makes me feel
incompetent and not really want to stick

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:17.670
incompetent and not really want to stick
 

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:19.940
incompetent and not really want to stick
with the exercise in contrast if I get

00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:19.950
with the exercise in contrast if I get
 

00:10:19.950 --> 00:10:21.500
with the exercise in contrast if I get
informational feedback about how to do

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:21.510
informational feedback about how to do

it better then I grow then you're on the
 

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.270
it better then I grow then you're on the
right side of motivation so a lot of

accidentally we essentially judge their
lack of effectiveness and that basically

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:36.600
lack of effectiveness and that basically
 

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:37.830
lack of effectiveness and that basically
undermines motivation

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:37.840
undermines motivation

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:49.930
application so what we're going to talk
 

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.870
application so what we're going to talk
about more is that when you have a huge

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880
about more is that when you have a huge
 

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.700
about more is that when you have a huge
consumer base people come in with

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:53.710
consumer base people come in with
 

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.100
consumer base people come in with
different degrees of expertise and then

00:10:56.100 --> 00:10:56.110
different degrees of expertise and then
 

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:57.750
different degrees of expertise and then
as they engage in your app obviously

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:57.760
as they engage in your app obviously
 

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.610
as they engage in your app obviously
their building experience over time and

00:10:59.610 --> 00:10:59.620
their building experience over time and
 

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.560
their building experience over time and
becoming more and more confident so if

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:01.570
becoming more and more confident so if
 

00:11:01.570 --> 00:11:03.630
becoming more and more confident so if
you know that fundamentally people need

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:03.640
you know that fundamentally people need
 

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.430
you know that fundamentally people need
to grow or they're gonna quit and

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:05.440
to grow or they're gonna quit and
 

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.380
to grow or they're gonna quit and
experience then you have to realize that

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:07.390
experience then you have to realize that
 

00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:09.120
experience then you have to realize that
you need to meet each person where they

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.130
you need to meet each person where they
 

00:11:09.130 --> 00:11:11.790
you need to meet each person where they
are both from an expertise standpoint

00:11:11.790 --> 00:11:11.800
are both from an expertise standpoint
 

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.850
are both from an expertise standpoint
and from an experience standpoint at the

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:14.860
and from an experience standpoint at the
 

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.010
and from an experience standpoint at the
point that they really need information

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:17.020
point that they really need information
 

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:18.540
point that they really need information
so you have to be really contextual

00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:18.550
so you have to be really contextual
 

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:20.520
so you have to be really contextual
about understanding what's important to

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:20.530
about understanding what's important to
 

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.710
about understanding what's important to
people progressing and kind of given

which you want to talk about your app
 

00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:37.710
which you want to talk about your app
both in app and kind of when just

both in app and kind of when just
 

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.780
both in app and kind of when just
talking to people is you want to kind of

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:39.790
talking to people is you want to kind of

how they can continue to develop the
 

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:45.690
how they can continue to develop the
longer they stay with the app that's

longer they stay with the app that's
essentially where people get a lot of

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.110
essentially where people get a lot of
 

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:49.200
essentially where people get a lot of
value from things so that's essentially

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:49.210
value from things so that's essentially
 

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:50.700
value from things so that's essentially
a key part of your messaging and

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:50.710
a key part of your messaging and
 

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:54.780
a key part of your messaging and
communication so fulfillment of these

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:54.790
communication so fulfillment of these
 

00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:56.940
communication so fulfillment of these
needs is essential in applications

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:56.950
needs is essential in applications
 

00:11:56.950 --> 00:11:58.590
needs is essential in applications
because they're essential in life this

00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600
because they're essential in life this

satisfied consumers so when your

00:12:08.250 --> 00:12:08.260
satisfied consumers so when your
 

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.710
satisfied consumers so when your
application leverages these truths about

00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720
application leverages these truths about
 

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.080
application leverages these truths about
motivation then you get lots of benefits

00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:13.090
motivation then you get lots of benefits
 

00:12:13.090 --> 00:12:14.730
motivation then you get lots of benefits
to all the things that you care about

00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:14.740
to all the things that you care about
 

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.430
to all the things that you care about
as a business long-term engagement etc

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:17.440
as a business long-term engagement etc
 

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.240
as a business long-term engagement etc
etc so that's the general framework a

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:21.250
etc so that's the general framework a
 

00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:23.220
etc so that's the general framework a
lot of times it's easier to understand

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:23.230
lot of times it's easier to understand
 

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.180
lot of times it's easier to understand
this when we go from the general

this when we go from the general
conversation to specific so I'm going to

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:26.650
conversation to specific so I'm going to
 

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.800
conversation to specific so I'm going to
talk about some of the apps that we've

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:28.810
talk about some of the apps that we've
 

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:31.020
talk about some of the apps that we've
worked with recently and kind of put a

00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:31.030
worked with recently and kind of put a
 

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:34.230
worked with recently and kind of put a
little more meat on these bones so an

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:34.240
little more meat on these bones so an
 

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.560
little more meat on these bones so an
important topic that's a huge issue for

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:37.570
important topic that's a huge issue for
 

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:40.950
important topic that's a huge issue for
behavioral scientists is retirement I

when you work as a behavioral scientists

00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:24.559
when you work as a behavioral scientists
 

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:25.869
when you work as a behavioral scientists
on this problem the first thing is that

00:13:25.869 --> 00:13:25.879
on this problem the first thing is that
 

00:13:25.879 --> 00:13:27.850
on this problem the first thing is that
anyone you talk to once doesn't want to

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:27.860
anyone you talk to once doesn't want to
 

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.160
anyone you talk to once doesn't want to
talk about the topic which obviously is

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:30.170
talk about the topic which obviously is
 

00:13:30.170 --> 00:13:32.860
talk about the topic which obviously is
a challenge when we start looking at

00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:32.870
a challenge when we start looking at
 

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:34.119
a challenge when we start looking at
retirement apps we ran into another

00:13:34.119 --> 00:13:34.129
retirement apps we ran into another
 

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:36.670
retirement apps we ran into another
problem all retirement apps start with

00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:36.680
problem all retirement apps start with
 

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.699
problem all retirement apps start with
what we would basically characterize is

00:13:38.699 --> 00:13:38.709
what we would basically characterize is
 

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:41.499
what we would basically characterize is
terrifying math questions so they

00:13:41.499 --> 00:13:41.509
terrifying math questions so they
 

00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:42.970
terrifying math questions so they
basically ask you these two things they

00:13:42.970 --> 00:13:42.980
basically ask you these two things they
 

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.579
basically ask you these two things they
first say when do you plan to retire and

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:45.589
first say when do you plan to retire and
 

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:47.769
first say when do you plan to retire and
the second thing they say is how long

00:13:47.769 --> 00:13:47.779
the second thing they say is how long
 

00:13:47.779 --> 00:13:49.780
the second thing they say is how long
will you stay in retirement when you

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:49.790
will you stay in retirement when you
 

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:51.460
will you stay in retirement when you
look at that closely what it really

00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:51.470
look at that closely what it really
 

00:13:51.470 --> 00:13:53.350
look at that closely what it really
basically boils down to is when are you

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:53.360
basically boils down to is when are you
 

00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.199
basically boils down to is when are you
planning to die so if you wanted to

00:13:56.199 --> 00:13:56.209
planning to die so if you wanted to
 

00:13:56.209 --> 00:13:58.449
planning to die so if you wanted to
demotivate people that's essentially the

00:13:58.449 --> 00:13:58.459
demotivate people that's essentially the
 

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:00.850
demotivate people that's essentially the
perfect construction because not only do

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:00.860
perfect construction because not only do
 

00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:02.170
perfect construction because not only do
people not know the answer to those

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:02.180
people not know the answer to those
 

00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:04.660
people not know the answer to those
questions but it makes them like fill an

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:04.670
questions but it makes them like fill an
 

00:14:04.670 --> 00:14:07.179
questions but it makes them like fill an
existential crisis that they don't know

00:14:07.179 --> 00:14:07.189
existential crisis that they don't know
 

00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:09.340
existential crisis that they don't know
the answer and that death is impending

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:09.350
the answer and that death is impending
 

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:12.040
the answer and that death is impending
so retirement apps like their if their

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:12.050
so retirement apps like their if their
 

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:13.480
so retirement apps like their if their
goal has been to like terrify their

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:13.490
goal has been to like terrify their
 

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.639
goal has been to like terrify their
customers they're really on top of

00:14:15.639 --> 00:14:15.649
customers they're really on top of
 

00:14:15.649 --> 00:14:18.429
customers they're really on top of
things and horribly that is their goal

00:14:18.429 --> 00:14:18.439
things and horribly that is their goal
 

00:14:18.439 --> 00:14:19.929
things and horribly that is their goal
because essentially their model for how

00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:19.939
because essentially their model for how
 

00:14:19.939 --> 00:14:21.910
because essentially their model for how
to increase entire meant is to scare

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920
to increase entire meant is to scare
 

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.949
to increase entire meant is to scare
people to essentially make them feel

00:14:23.949 --> 00:14:23.959
people to essentially make them feel
 

00:14:23.959 --> 00:14:26.319
people to essentially make them feel
that if they don't do this then horrible

00:14:26.319 --> 00:14:26.329
that if they don't do this then horrible
 

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:27.970
that if they don't do this then horrible
things will happen to them if you

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:27.980
things will happen to them if you
 

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:29.710
things will happen to them if you
remember what we talked about earlier

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:29.720
remember what we talked about earlier
 

00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.509
remember what we talked about earlier
about motivational quality that's what

00:14:31.509 --> 00:14:31.519
about motivational quality that's what
 

00:14:31.519 --> 00:14:33.549
about motivational quality that's what
we call external pressure where you're

00:14:33.549 --> 00:14:33.559
we call external pressure where you're
 

00:14:33.559 --> 00:14:35.199
we call external pressure where you're
basically trying to get actions by

00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:35.209
basically trying to get actions by
 

00:14:35.209 --> 00:14:37.179
basically trying to get actions by
scaring people instead what we want to

00:14:37.179 --> 00:14:37.189
scaring people instead what we want to
 

00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:38.799
scaring people instead what we want to
do is make people realize what the

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:38.809
do is make people realize what the
 

00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:40.689
do is make people realize what the
benefit for them of preparing for

00:14:40.689 --> 00:14:40.699
benefit for them of preparing for
 

00:14:40.699 --> 00:14:42.549
benefit for them of preparing for
retirement is so we had a different view

00:14:42.549 --> 00:14:42.559
retirement is so we had a different view
 

00:14:42.559 --> 00:14:44.790
retirement is so we had a different view
than the traditional retirement industry

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800
than the traditional retirement industry
 

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.590
than the traditional retirement industry
so how did we approach this first we

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600
so how did we approach this first we
 

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.449
so how did we approach this first we
want to flip the script and basically

00:14:49.449 --> 00:14:49.459
want to flip the script and basically
 

00:14:49.459 --> 00:14:51.249
want to flip the script and basically
talked to the people using the app and

00:14:51.249 --> 00:14:51.259
talked to the people using the app and
 

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:53.169
talked to the people using the app and
say it's not about math it's about

00:14:53.169 --> 00:14:53.179
say it's not about math it's about
 

00:14:53.179 --> 00:14:55.269
say it's not about math it's about
creating a foundation foundation from

00:14:55.269 --> 00:14:55.279
creating a foundation foundation from
 

00:14:55.279 --> 00:14:56.660
creating a foundation foundation from
living the life that you

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:56.670
living the life that you
 

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:58.790
living the life that you
one of the big disconnects that people

00:14:58.790 --> 00:14:58.800
one of the big disconnects that people
 

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.320
one of the big disconnects that people
have when they think about retirement is

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:00.330
have when they think about retirement is
 

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:01.940
have when they think about retirement is
they don't realize that the person

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:01.950
they don't realize that the person
 

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:04.460
they don't realize that the person
they're gonna be in 10 20 30 years when

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:04.470
they're gonna be in 10 20 30 years when
 

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:06.320
they're gonna be in 10 20 30 years when
they retire is the same person they are

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:06.330
they retire is the same person they are
 

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:08.570
they retire is the same person they are
now so where we want to start the

00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:08.580
now so where we want to start the
 

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:10.880
now so where we want to start the
conversation is basically what do you

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:10.890
conversation is basically what do you
 

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.150
conversation is basically what do you
love in life if you had more time more

00:15:14.150 --> 00:15:14.160
love in life if you had more time more
 

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.430
love in life if you had more time more
money how would you spend that time and

00:15:16.430 --> 00:15:16.440
money how would you spend that time and
 

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.130
money how would you spend that time and
money what are your passions what do you

00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.140
money what are your passions what do you
 

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.560
money what are your passions what do you
care about this is diametrically opposed

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:21.570
care about this is diametrically opposed
 

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.390
care about this is diametrically opposed
to when do you plan to die it's

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:23.400
to when do you plan to die it's
 

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.980
to when do you plan to die it's
essentially saying why do you want to

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:24.990
essentially saying why do you want to

live you know what do you care about so
that's where we started the application

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600
that's where we started the application
 

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.690
that's where we started the application
script the second thing is once we got

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:32.700
script the second thing is once we got
 

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.390

people really fixed on that point we

00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:35.400
people really fixed on that point we
 

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.860
people really fixed on that point we
wanted to make them more effective at

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:36.870
wanted to make them more effective at
 

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.270
wanted to make them more effective at
answering the questions we needed them

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:38.280
answering the questions we needed them
 

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.920
answering the questions we needed them
to answer to figure out what the right

00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:39.930
to answer to figure out what the right
 

00:15:39.930 --> 00:15:41.810
to answer to figure out what the right
plan was for them so we made the

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:41.820
plan was for them so we made the
 

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.640
plan was for them so we made the
language less jargon II made it more

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:43.650
language less jargon II made it more
 

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.100
language less jargon II made it more
colloquial tied the questions back to

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:46.110
colloquial tied the questions back to
 

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.390
colloquial tied the questions back to
the plan that they had already started

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:47.400
the plan that they had already started
 

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.770
the plan that they had already started
to make when they discuss what they

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:48.780
to make when they discuss what they
 

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.630
to make when they discuss what they
cared about their lives and it put

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:50.640
cared about their lives and it put
 

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:52.760
cared about their lives and it put
things in a much more comfortable way

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:52.770
things in a much more comfortable way
 

00:15:52.770 --> 00:15:54.590
things in a much more comfortable way
for them to kind of intelligently answer

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:54.600
for them to kind of intelligently answer
 

00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:56.450
for them to kind of intelligently answer
those questions one of the things that

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:56.460
those questions one of the things that
 

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.130
those questions one of the things that
you find when you take this approach is

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.140
you find when you take this approach is
 

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.160
you find when you take this approach is
that people feel much more support and

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:01.170
that people feel much more support and
 

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.050
that people feel much more support and
caring from the application in the

caring from the application in the
company because it's not trying to

00:16:04.490 --> 00:16:04.500
company because it's not trying to
 

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.380
company because it's not trying to
terrify them anymore it's basically

00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:06.390
terrify them anymore it's basically
 

00:16:06.390 --> 00:16:07.940
terrify them anymore it's basically
trying to support them and help them

00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:07.950
trying to support them and help them
 

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:10.040

plan for retirement so the latest scores

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:10.050
plan for retirement so the latest scores
 

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:12.710
plan for retirement so the latest scores
shot up immediately when we worked with

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720

shot up immediately when we worked with
their client they came to us so they

00:16:14.570 --> 00:16:14.580
their client they came to us so they
 

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.090
their client they came to us so they
obviously felt some appeal for this

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:17.100
obviously felt some appeal for this
 

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.860
obviously felt some appeal for this
approach but then when we started to say

00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:18.870
approach but then when we started to say
 

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:20.510
approach but then when we started to say
this is what our plan is they were kind

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:20.520
this is what our plan is they were kind
 

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:23.060
this is what our plan is they were kind
of nervous because their experience over

about it success happily what we saw
 

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.810
about it success happily what we saw
when we finished the application is that

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:41.820
when we finished the application is that
 

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:43.610

is there are a lot of behaviors that you
 

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.430
is there are a lot of behaviors that you
see and the real question is why is

massive for this if you go to a gym you

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:23.390
massive for this if you go to a gym you
 

00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:25.510
massive for this if you go to a gym you
see a hundred people they're all working

see a hundred people they're all working
 

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.000
see a hundred people they're all working
out so behaviorally they all look like

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:28.010
out so behaviorally they all look like
 

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:29.920
out so behaviorally they all look like
they're doing the activity that you want

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:29.930
they're doing the activity that you want
 

00:17:29.930 --> 00:17:32.350
they're doing the activity that you want
that they're all successfully exercising

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360
that they're all successfully exercising
 

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.030
that they're all successfully exercising
but what's under the surface is very

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:34.040
but what's under the surface is very
 

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.550
but what's under the surface is very
important to the prediction model for

important to the prediction model for
 

00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:39.280
important to the prediction model for
how long they continue to exercise so

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:39.290
how long they continue to exercise so
 

00:17:39.290 --> 00:17:41.170
how long they continue to exercise so
the question is is what can we do with

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:41.180
the question is is what can we do with
 

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.660
the question is is what can we do with
our framework to help find where each

00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:43.670
our framework to help find where each
 

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.160
our framework to help find where each
user is and help them along their

00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:45.170
user is and help them along their
 

00:17:45.170 --> 00:17:47.920
user is and help them along their
journey to a healthier life so the first

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:47.930
journey to a healthier life so the first
 

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:49.090
journey to a healthier life so the first
thing you want to do is you want to

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.100
thing you want to do is you want to
 

00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:50.530
thing you want to do is you want to
measure and understand where the

00:17:50.530 --> 00:17:50.540
measure and understand where the
 

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:52.210
measure and understand where the
customers at motivationally and I'm

00:17:52.210 --> 00:17:52.220
customers at motivationally and I'm
 

00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.650
customers at motivationally and I'm
gonna kind of click through a number of

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:53.660
gonna kind of click through a number of
 

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.810
gonna kind of click through a number of
statements which basically characterize

00:17:55.810 --> 00:17:55.820
statements which basically characterize
 

00:17:55.820 --> 00:17:57.520
statements which basically characterize
different kinds of motivational quality

00:17:57.520 --> 00:17:57.530
different kinds of motivational quality
 

00:17:57.530 --> 00:17:59.860
different kinds of motivational quality
so someone might be exercising because

00:17:59.860 --> 00:17:59.870
so someone might be exercising because
 

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:01.000
so someone might be exercising because
they were told they need to make changes

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:01.010
they were told they need to make changes
 

00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:03.040
they were told they need to make changes
or they're gonna die this is close to

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:03.050
or they're gonna die this is close to
 

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:05.230
or they're gonna die this is close to
our retirement thing again where if you

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240
our retirement thing again where if you
 

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:06.670
our retirement thing again where if you
don't do this horrible things will

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:06.680
don't do this horrible things will
 

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.910
don't do this horrible things will
happen the next one is I know I should

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:09.920
happen the next one is I know I should
 

00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:12.370
happen the next one is I know I should
focus on my health I'll feel guilty if I

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:12.380
focus on my health I'll feel guilty if I
 

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.050
focus on my health I'll feel guilty if I
don't I know it's the right thing to do

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:14.060
don't I know it's the right thing to do
 

00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:16.120
don't I know it's the right thing to do
not necessarily I want to do it but I

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.130
not necessarily I want to do it but I
 

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:18.790
not necessarily I want to do it but I
should do it the next statement is I

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:18.800
should do it the next statement is I
 

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.140
should do it the next statement is I
want to take care of myself because I

00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:20.150
want to take care of myself because I
 

00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:21.820
want to take care of myself because I
know it will benefit my quality of life

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:21.830
know it will benefit my quality of life
 

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:24.880
know it will benefit my quality of life
and the last one is I just enjoy having

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:24.890
and the last one is I just enjoy having
 

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.430
and the last one is I just enjoy having
a healthy lifestyle basically each of

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440
a healthy lifestyle basically each of
 

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.550
a healthy lifestyle basically each of
these are a different step along the way

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:30.560
these are a different step along the way
 

00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.040
these are a different step along the way
to higher motivational quality and what

00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:33.050
to higher motivational quality and what
 

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.170
to higher motivational quality and what
we know by doing these studies a hundred

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:35.180
we know by doing these studies a hundred
 

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:37.480
we know by doing these studies a hundred
different times is that where you are in

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:37.490
different times is that where you are in
 

00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:40.120
different times is that where you are in
this journey is predictive of how long

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:40.130
this journey is predictive of how long
 

00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:41.010
this journey is predictive of how long
you're gonna continue to exercise

00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:41.020
you're gonna continue to exercise
 

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.150
you're gonna continue to exercise
essentially the first statements that I

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:43.160
essentially the first statements that I
 

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:45.730
essentially the first statements that I
read have very bad results that's where

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:45.740
read have very bad results that's where
 

00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.440
read have very bad results that's where
you hear people like that stats like

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:47.450
you hear people like that stats like
 

00:18:47.450 --> 00:18:49.060
you hear people like that stats like
only 5% of people that start an exercise

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:49.070
only 5% of people that start an exercise
 

00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.310
only 5% of people that start an exercise
program continue with it for more than

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:51.320
program continue with it for more than
 

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:53.860
program continue with it for more than
eight weeks on the far right you see

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:53.870
eight weeks on the far right you see
 

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.270
eight weeks on the far right you see
great outcomes these are the people that

00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280
great outcomes these are the people that
 

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.340
great outcomes these are the people that
run every day have happy healthy lives

00:18:57.340 --> 00:18:57.350
run every day have happy healthy lives
 

00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:59.260
run every day have happy healthy lives
and so the question is you know what do

00:18:59.260 --> 00:18:59.270
and so the question is you know what do
 

00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:00.820
and so the question is you know what do
you do about this problem because tons

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:00.830
you do about this problem because tons
 

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:01.780
you do about this problem because tons
of the people that come into

00:19:01.780 --> 00:19:01.790
of the people that come into
 

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:04.060
of the people that come into
applications are coming to gyms sit in

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:04.070
applications are coming to gyms sit in
 

00:19:04.070 --> 00:19:05.890
applications are coming to gyms sit in
the unhealthy space motivationally and

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:05.900
the unhealthy space motivationally and
 

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.750
the unhealthy space motivationally and
so as behavioral scientists they care

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:07.760
so as behavioral scientists they care
 

00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.520
so as behavioral scientists they care
about people's well-being can we do

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:09.530
about people's well-being can we do
 

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.290
about people's well-being can we do
anything so first we understand where

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:11.300
anything so first we understand where
 

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.990
anything so first we understand where
they're at the next thing we do is if we

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000
they're at the next thing we do is if we
 

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.880
they're at the next thing we do is if we
know they're in a place motivationally

00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:15.890
know they're in a place motivationally
 

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:16.500
know they're in a place motivationally
that's

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:16.510
that's
 

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:19.200
that's
predictive of them continuing on with

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.210
predictive of them continuing on with
 

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:20.730
predictive of them continuing on with
exercise then we know that we have to

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:20.740
exercise then we know that we have to
 

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:23.040
exercise then we know that we have to
help them internalize greater value for

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.050
help them internalize greater value for
 

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:25.350
help them internalize greater value for
the activity that means giving them the

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360
the activity that means giving them the
 

00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.540
the activity that means giving them the
right content that supports their

competence communicates to them the
 

00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:32.100
competence communicates to them the
long-term value essentially tries to

00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:32.110
long-term value essentially tries to
 

00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:34.620
long-term value essentially tries to
make it argument experientially about

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:34.630
make it argument experientially about
 

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:36.210
make it argument experientially about
what the benefits of exercise are gonna

00:19:36.210 --> 00:19:36.220
what the benefits of exercise are gonna

you're in an exercise app oftentimes the
 

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.660
you're in an exercise app oftentimes the
assumption is you already know

they lack competence so then when they

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:21.970
they lack competence so then when they
 

00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:23.760
they lack competence so then when they
take their first baby steps into doing

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:23.770

that's a barrier for people continued on
so again this is where you don't want

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520
so again this is where you don't want
 

00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.640
so again this is where you don't want
the feedback to be judgmental you want

00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:35.650
the feedback to be judgmental you want
 

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:37.640
the feedback to be judgmental you want
it to be informational and oftentimes

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:37.650
it to be informational and oftentimes
 

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.540

subtle ways that kind of mentions
 

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:42.600
subtle ways that kind of mentions
earlier where we'll do things that have

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:42.610
earlier where we'll do things that have
 

00:20:42.610 --> 00:20:45.210
earlier where we'll do things that have
strong heuristic value like flashed a

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:45.220

red light to say that your forms wrong

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.200
red light to say that your forms wrong
 

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.530
red light to say that your forms wrong

but essentially what someone's seen
 

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.780
but essentially what someone's seen
that's in a fragile state around their

00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:51.790
that's in a fragile state around their
 

00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.790
that's in a fragile state around their
competence is I'm doing this wrong and

00:20:53.790 --> 00:20:53.800
competence is I'm doing this wrong and

00:20:57.900 --> 00:20:57.910
point I should eat potato chips instead
 

00:20:57.910 --> 00:20:59.460
point I should eat potato chips instead
what they need at that point is support

00:20:59.460 --> 00:20:59.470
what they need at that point is support
 

00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:01.770
what they need at that point is support
and so really what this approach is

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:01.780
and so really what this approach is
 

00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:03.780
and so really what this approach is
about is recognizing where people are

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:03.790
about is recognizing where people are
 

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:05.790
