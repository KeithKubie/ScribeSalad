BILL LUAN: Shanghai
GDG is a very

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.000
interesting developer community.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
glad somebody

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.120
has asked this question.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.186
MALE SPEAKER: This is where
the magic happens.

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:17.570
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is
primarily a question and

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.070
answer show.

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.560
So if any of you out there would
like to ask questions--

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:26.730
MIHAI IONESCU: Hello.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.990
Welcome to Google
Payments Live.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.049
We have a very exciting session
today about one of the

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.980
coolest products at Google.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.530
And our special guest is Robin
Dua, head of product

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.250
management for Google Wallet.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.410
And of course, we're going
to talk about all the new

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.720
exciting developments around
Google Wallet.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.430
So let's start with an
easy question, Robin.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.110
What is Google Wallet?

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.410
ROBIN DUA: Great.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.740
Well, first off, thanks for
having me here today.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.040
Google Wallet is an electronic
wallet that allows you to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.250
store all your credit cards,
debit cards, loyalty programs,

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.580
as well as offers that you've
clipped from different places,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.800
all in one place that are easily
accessible through your

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.519
phone as well as online.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.330
Users could access their Wallet
both online as well as

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.540
through their phone for
making purchases.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.720
And it's also a great way for
users to be able to discover

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.554
great offers that they're
interested in and save money.

00:01:19.554 --> 00:01:20.000
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.610
So we recently announced
that we moved all

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.690
cards to the cloud.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.815
Can you tell us a little bit
more about the technology

00:01:25.815 --> 00:01:27.400
behind this transition?

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.820
ROBIN DUA: Sure.

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
Well, let me just start by
talking a little bit about the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.860
momentum that has really
accelerated around the product

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.520
since we launched Google
Wallet back in

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.120
September of last year.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.920
We started with one bank
partner, which was Citibank,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.640
and we had one carrier
partner, Sprint.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.390
And users were only able to use
a single device when we

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.260
launched, which was the
Nexus S device.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.980
And since then, we now support
a total of six devices on two

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.550
carrier networks, both Virgin
Mobile as well as Sprint.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.920
And there's 25 national
retailers that are showcasing

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.950
the full Google Wallet user
experience that combines

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.830
offers, payments, loyalty as
part of our single-tap user

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.530
experience that we created.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.970
And what single-tap allows a
user to do is with one tap

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.370
they're able to transmit their
payment information, their

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.150
loyalty information, as well as
coupons that they're trying

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.830
to redeem, all with
a single action.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.080
And these national retailers
have done a special

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.490
integration to create that
user experience in their

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.960
stores as part of the purchasing
experience.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.450
We also have a total of about
200,000 locations where users

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.950
could actually tap their phone
and pay for things using

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.710
Google Wallet.

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.780
And that number is continuing to
increase month over month.

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.420
And we're excited by the fact
that retailers are continuing

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.250
to add contactless readers
to their point of sale.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.010
And there'll be a lot more
places to use it.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.060
In terms of the reference that
you made to our support for

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.660
all cards in the Wallet, we're
really excited by the

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.870
announcement we made at the
beginning of August where

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.840
Google Wallet now supports all
your credit and debit cards.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.540
So you can link any Visa,
MasterCard, Amex, Discover

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.670
branded card to your Wallet
and use it not only for

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.820
in-store purchases using the
phone but use it online as

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.680
well at participating
retailers.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.040
And the nice thing about Google
Wallet is the Wallet

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.960
could also be used for purchases
through Google

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.460
Properties as well, like the
Google store where you could

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.130
buy applications,
digital content.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.260
You can also use it to buy
digital content through

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.050
YouTube as well as the Chrome
store and other

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.960
properties as well.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.470
So Google Wallet is really
becoming the central way to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.250
make purchases, not only on
Google Properties but in store

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.880
as well as online as well.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.180
MIHAI IONESCU: Sounds
exciting.

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.360
How about a demo?

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.470
Can you show us how the
new Wallet works?

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.860
ROBIN DUA: Yeah.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:04.640
Absolutely.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.250
I'd be excited to show you
guys a new version of our

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.635
application that we launched
at the beginning of August.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.019
PENG YING: Our producer, Louis,
has heroically given us

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.320
his Galaxy Nexus to play with.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.650
ROBIN DUA: Great.

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.370
Well, let me just start on
the main screen here.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.880
So what users are looking at
right now is the main screen

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.230
that you see when you go
into Google Wallet.

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.500
So there's four icons
on the main screen--

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.360
Payment Cards, Rewards Cards,
Offers, and Transactions.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.920
So if I go into Payment Cards,
this is where I would see the

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.830
cards that I've added to Google
Wallet, either online

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.520
or through the application
itself.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.080
And the nice thing about the
application is I could go in

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:00.080
and add cards any time if I
choose to add additional

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.040
credit or debit cards to
my Wallet application.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.370
In addition to that, we've got
a prepaid card which is

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.480
available for users that want
a stored-value-based product

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.400
to transact with.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:18.705
And here you could see all the
cards that are in the Wallet

00:05:18.705 --> 00:05:19.450
that I'm demoing.

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.160
So there's an Amazon Visa.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.560
There's a United Visa card.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.300
I could also add additional
gift cards into

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.690
the Wallet as well.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.550
So just going back to the main
screen for a second, I could

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.310
also discover offers from
participating merchants that I

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.070
might be interested in.

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.540
So here I could see offers
from Foot Locker.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.730
There is some offers from
American Eagle, and other

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.265
nearby retailers as well.

00:05:46.265 --> 00:05:48.620
PENG YING: Oh, my. $7
off large pizzas.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.390
ROBIN DUA: That's right.

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.445
PENG YING: Where's that from?

00:05:50.445 --> 00:05:52.300
ROBIN DUA: That one is actually

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.150
from Mario's Italiano.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.390
MIHAI IONESCU: Sounds
delicious.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.970
ROBIN DUA: That's only 1.7 miles
away, so maybe we could

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:01.630
get over there for
lunch after.

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.910
PENG YING: Early lunch.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.300
MIHAI IONESCU: I'm getting
hungry already.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.860
ROBIN DUA: That's right.

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.330
Exactly.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:09.410
So you could see that there's a
lot of offers that are shown

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.100
here in the list.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.180
And what we're trying to do is
increase the offers inventory

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:18.530
so that everybody could find
great deals from merchants

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:20.790
that they love.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:24.240
And the other thing to just
highlight here is you could

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.670
see all the transactions that
you made using Google Wallet,

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.700
both online as well as in-store
transactions that you

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.440
made with the phone.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.410
And if you click on one of
these transactions in the

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.640
history, it'll show you the name
of the retailer, the date

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.730
and time that you made the
transaction, the amount, the

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.910
payment method that you used
to make the transaction.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.170
And if you've enabled it in the
application itself, it'll

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:49.620
also show you a map of where
you did the transaction.

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.440
And this is a great way for
people to see where they

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.750
actually did a transaction.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.070
It kind of is a nice way to
jog their memory about a

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:02.300
particular retailer where they
transacted and they want to

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:03.255
remember where it was.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:05.537
PENG YING: That's for those,
like, hazy bar nights, right?

00:07:05.537 --> 00:07:06.670
You're like, oh, man--

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:07.460
ROBIN DUA: Exactly.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.260
PENG YING: --where was I?

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.080
ROBIN DUA: For those bar nights
where you had a great

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.540
time and you want to figure out
where it was and you don't

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:15.040
really remember, you could go
into Google Wallet and see a

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.460
little map.

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.600
And it'll tell you how
to get there, so.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.710
So those are some of the core
features of the Wallet

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:22.240
application.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.510
So key things to highlight that
we did as part of the

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.650
August release-- one is
we now support all

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.430
cards in the Wallet.

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:29.940
PENG YING: Awesome.

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.950
ROBIN DUA: Two, we actually
enabled some additional

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.460
security features for users.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.730
So users can now go online.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.750
In the event that they lose
their phone, they could

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:43.460
actually disable Google Wallet
on their phone remotely.

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.870
And what this web-based feature
does is it also wipes

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.520
out any information that's
stored on your phone related

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:51.840
to your Wallet.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.940
So there's added peace of
mind there for users.

00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.730
And the third thing that we've
done is we've enhanced the

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.770
user interface to make it a
lot more user friendly.

00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:05.870
And you could see that just
adding cards to the Wallet

00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:08.220
could be done with just
a few clicks.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:10.880
And we're really excited
about that.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:11.330
PENG YING: OK.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:12.610
That's pretty awesome.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:15.970
So you previously talked about
the growth that we've

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.730
currently experienced and then
where we are right now.

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:22.100
But I guess everybody is
interested in where we go in

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.630
the future.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.180
What are we doing to try to
drive growth, both in terms of

00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.990
number of users of Wallet and
the number of merchants who

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:30.170
support Wallet?

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:30.450
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.320
Well, the vision behind Wallet
is we want it to be an

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.350
electronic wallet that holds
all your payment cards,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:40.190
loyalty cards, gift cards, but
also other types of digital

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.510
objects, things that you have in
your physical wallet today.

00:08:43.510 --> 00:08:48.550
So things like identification,
as an example, or the transit

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:56.160
pass that you use every day,
also boarding passes, and

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.440
other forms of loyalty,
and so forth.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.490
So what we're trying to do is
electronify all of these

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.630
things and make them easily
accessible through the phone,

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.380
but also available for online
purchases and interactions

00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.680
online as well.

00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:15.320
In terms of distribution, as I
mentioned earlier, we have six

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.890
devices that we support today.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.450
We think NFC is going to become
a standard feature of

00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:22.450
all smartphones over the
next little while.

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.530
And we're already starting
to see evidence

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:25.920
of that in the market.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.180
And as a result of that, we
want Google Wallet to be

00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:33.270
available on all devices
and all platforms.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.320
And we want it to be the
preferred way that consumers

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.260
pay for things.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.090
PENG YING: So what
about merchants?

00:09:38.090 --> 00:09:39.920
How are we driving merchant
adoption?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.070
Is it just because we're driving
user adoption and

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:44.220
merchants are like, uh-oh, OK,
there's more users so I should

00:09:44.220 --> 00:09:45.160
just support it as well?

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.890
Or are we helping them
with point of sale or

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:48.880
anything like that?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.060
Can you even get into
that at all?

00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:50.310
ROBIN DUA: Yeah.

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:50.510
No.

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:51.320
Absolutely.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.420
So one of the things that we've
done is we've actually

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:59.800
created single-tap, which allows
merchants to integrate

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:03.670
our technology into their
point-of-sale system to enable

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.490
this great one-tap user
experience that combines

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:11.240
offers, payments, loyalty into
a single interaction.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.570
One of the things that we're
trying to do is actually

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:17.280
enable more cloud-based services
for retailers.

00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:22.190
So things like being able to
enable delivery of coupons as

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.760
well as loyalty information
from the cloud back to the

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.880
point of sale.

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.920
And we're also enabling
cloud-based tools that allow

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.440
retailers to create customized
loyalty programs and targeted

00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.110
offers campaigns and really get
a great set of analytics

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:43.700
that they can have access to
to know who their customers

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:48.970
are, how they're shopping at
their locations, and whether

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:52.790
the campaigns are effective in
terms of bringing users back

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:56.210
into their stores and increasing
the basket size of

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.230
their purchases.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:01.800
So one of the things that we're
trying to do is really

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.510
make it easy not only for the
large retailer to use these

00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:09.160
tools for offers and loyalty
programs, but we want to make

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:11.700
it accessible to small to
midsize retailers as well.

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:14.030
And so over the next little
while, you're going to see

00:11:14.030 --> 00:11:18.170
Google Wallet create these new
cloud-based services that will

00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.790
make couponing campaigns,
loyalty campaigns accessible

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.000
to all merchants.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.980
PENG YING: So it seems like you
are trying to tie online

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.190
traffic with brick-and-mortar
store traffic, right?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.635
That's the goal?

00:11:32.635 --> 00:11:32.920
One of the goals.

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:34.080
ROBIN DUA: That's one
of the goals.

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:34.760
PENG YING: One of the goals.

00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.400
ROBIN DUA: And if you look at
what we're trying to do

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.630
through the Wallet from a
consumer perspective, which is

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.110
helping them discover great
offers that they're interested

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:48.060
in and helping them connect with
merchants that they love.

00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:51.430
On the merchant side, we're also
trying to make it easier

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:56.430
for them to connect with the
consumers that are shopping in

00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:59.270
their stores and help them bring
those consumers back

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:00.860
into their stores.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:03.150
PENG YING: Seems really useful
to be able to say, hey, why

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.690
don't you come back some time?

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.080
So now that we talked about
that a little bit, can you

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:13.970
kind of expand on the vision
of what we hope the Wallet

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:14.970
ecosystem will be?

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:18.520
What we hope to enable both
users of Wallet and any

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.580
additional features and
functionality for merchants of

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.320
Wallet to be able to offer?

00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:22.830
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:27.340
So, in terms of what we envision
Wallet becoming, we

00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:31.800
want it to be a platform where
merchants could integrate

00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:35.900
their loyalty programs and
offers campaigns easily into

00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.420
Wallet and not have to do
extensive point-of-sale

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.480
integrations.

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:44.150
And what we're focused on is
making it super simple for

00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:46.230
merchants to take advantage of
these programs, with either

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:48.980
doing no integration at all
and just leveraging their

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.180
existing card network processing
that they already

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:54.400
have in place.

00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:57.290
And in some cases, just
providing light APIs that

00:12:57.290 --> 00:13:00.060
would allow merchants to do
some of the things that I

00:13:00.060 --> 00:13:01.940
talked about earlier.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:06.050
And from the standpoint of other
partners, one of things

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:10.450
that we're trying to do is make
it easy for airlines,

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:16.030
transit providers, other types
of issuers of credentials,

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:19.870
make it super simple for them
to get their credentials

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:22.570
stored in the Wallet.

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:25.970
And then this is where we kind
of envision an open platform

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.400
where we will allow all sorts
of partners to be able to

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.490
issue their credentials into the
Wallet and allow users to

00:13:33.490 --> 00:13:36.270
use them, not only with the
phone but also online as well.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.320
PENG YING: Finally, I could
totally just throw away my

00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.880
wallet-- except for
cash, I guess.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.470
I could probably carry a money
clip around or something.

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:44.570
ROBIN DUA: That's the goal.

00:13:44.570 --> 00:13:46.510
We want you to be able to leave
your leather wallet at

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:50.210
home and carry your phone and
transact with that as your

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:52.590
primary transaction device.

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:53.180
PENG YING: It totally
makes sense.

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.780
I don't think I leave the house
without my phone anyway

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.430
these days, so.

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:00.500
And then one last question--

00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.420
now that you've talked about all
of these things that we're

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.690
trying to do, how can developers
interact with these

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:07.150
products that we're going
to deploy or that

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.380
we're going to launch?

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:10.420
ROBIN DUA: Well, so one of the
things that we've done is

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.370
we've launched a set of APIs for
specific partners today.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.420
So we have APIs that allow
issuers, as an example, to

00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.980
integrate to us and enable their
users to save a credit

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:27.520
or debit card from internet
banking or mobile banking

00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.770
applications directly
to Google Wallet.

00:14:29.770 --> 00:14:33.420
And we announced a partnership
with Discover back at Google

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.390
I/O, which was just
a few weeks ago.

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:40.430
And we have a bunch of other
card issuer partners that are

00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:43.130
going to be announcing
the support for

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.370
those APIs very soon.

00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.710
So users will be able to go into
their internet and mobile

00:14:47.710 --> 00:14:52.450
banking applications to store
cards into Wallet.

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.900
One of the nice things that
we've done on that front is

00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:59.180
issuers could actually provide
us with their card art so that

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.370
when a user saves a card into
the Wallet, the user actually

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:06.820
sees a great representation of
that physical card that they

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.260
have in their leather wallet
in the phone as well.

00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:09.710
PENG YING: Cool.

00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:12.440
ROBIN DUA: And we've also got
a set of APIs that we

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.870
announced at Google I/O that
allow merchants to integrate a

00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:20.570
Save to Wallet button into their
email, as well as web

00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.920
marketing campaigns that
they're doing.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.050
So a user would see the Save to
Wallet button and be able

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:27.240
to clip a coupon

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.710
electronically to their Wallet.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.300
And that coupon would be
available through the

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.180
application on their phone.

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:39.900
And with our single-tap
technology, the coupon could

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:43.240
be used there or using a show
and scan type experience.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.770
So those are just two examples
of the types of APIs we have

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:49.030
available today.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:54.730
And we're working hard to create
a set of APIs that'll

00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:59.400
allow other types of partners
integrate into Wallet and take

00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.530
advantage of storing credentials
to the Wallet, but

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.000
also other features as well.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.980
PENG YING: So if a developer
wanted to get started with

00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:11.070
implementing some of these APIs
today, where would they

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:13.145
go to find out more
information?

00:16:13.145 --> 00:16:14.190
ROBIN DUA: Well, we've
got a partner

00:16:14.190 --> 00:16:16.400
website set up for issuers.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:21.070
So there's a dedicated site for
that where card issuers

00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:26.070
could learn more about the APIs
and sign up on the site.

00:16:26.070 --> 00:16:30.520
There's also a dedicated site
for merchants, as well, which

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.230
is available.

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:35.910
And then provides all sorts of
information about how to get

00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:38.410
access to the Save to Wallet
button and the APIs and how to

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:42.080
integrate it into their
marketing campaigns online.

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.860
And it's super simple
to integrate these

00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:44.850
APIs, by the way.

00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:48.940
It's just really a matter of
days and in some cases, hours.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:49.980
It's not a lot of work.

00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:50.260
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.190
We try to simplify as
much as we can.

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:54.220
So that site's

00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:56.540
google.com/payments, I believe?

00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:56.770
ROBIN DUA: Yeah.

00:16:56.770 --> 00:17:00.980
If you go to google.com/wallet,
this is a

00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:01.800
consumer site.

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:04.440
But you can actually access
some of the partner sites

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.200
through there as well.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.180
PENG YING: Got it.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:10.380
MIHAI IONESCU: So we get a lot
of questions from developers

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:12.630
and merchants about adoption.

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:17.950
And along those lines, can you
talk a little bit about NFC

00:17:17.950 --> 00:17:21.540
adoption and second,
about availability

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.800
on additional carriers?

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:23.599
ROBIN DUA: Sure.

00:17:23.599 --> 00:17:25.369
Great question.

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:28.760
When we first launched, we had
one device that supported

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.490
Google Wallet.

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:34.170
And we're up to six phones today
on two carrier networks,

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:36.460
Virgin as well as Sprint.

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:41.880
And we're looking to expand
our carrier distribution.

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.600
We're in discussions today
with a number of other

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:47.610
carriers and hope to make some
announcements over the next

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:48.120
little while.

00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.230
So stay tuned for that.

00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:55.270
Just on the device question, we
are going to see NFC become

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:57.800
a standard feature of every
smartphone device.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.730
This is a trend that is
taking place today.

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:03.750
Actually, a very good indication
of that is the

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:06.900
Galaxy S3, which launched
a little while ago.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:10.160
It sold 10 million devices
in the first two months.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:16.040
And this was a flagship device
of Samsung's and has NFC as a

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.250
core feature in there.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:21.500
And what's driving the NFC
adoption in phones is not just

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.410
the payments-use cases, but it's
also use cases like being

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:31.610
able to share content between
devices as well as pairing,

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:37.760
say, a handset as well as a set
of speakers or headphones

00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:38.860
to the device as well.

00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.210
So there's a lot more
applications for NFC.

00:18:41.210 --> 00:18:45.200
And you will see NFC become
a core feature just like

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:48.430
cameras, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
things that we kind of take

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:50.272
for granted today.

00:18:50.272 --> 00:18:55.030
Yeah, who thought a few years
ago that cameras would be in

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:55.750
every smartphone?

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.730
So NFC is going to take the
same position in terms of

00:19:00.730 --> 00:19:02.790
being a core feature
in devices.

00:19:02.790 --> 00:19:06.050
So that is actually
going to drive

00:19:06.050 --> 00:19:07.650
adoption of Google Wallet.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:11.810
And we're quite excited about
the trends that we're seeing

00:19:11.810 --> 00:19:12.530
in the market.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:12.860
MIHAI IONESCU: Great.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:14.690
Fantastic.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.450
Another question we get from
a lot of our developers, in

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.060
particular international
developers--

00:19:20.060 --> 00:19:23.950
we have plans to go
internationally and what's

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:25.120
stopping us?

00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:27.150
Why the delay on making
this available

00:19:27.150 --> 00:19:28.440
outside the United States?

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.020
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:29.720
Well, great question.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.220
We obviously wanted to get
Google Wallet perfected and

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:34.900
working here in the US.

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.440
We're a global company.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.080
We certainly have an interest
in bringing Google Wallet to

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.350
other markets overseas.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:48.200
And what I can tell you is we
are actively planning the

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:50.210
roll-out of Google Wallet
in other markets.

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:51.870
So stay tuned for some
announcements there.

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.770
I don't have anything to share
at this point, but we are

00:19:55.770 --> 00:19:57.640
actively pushing hard
to bring Google

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.694
Wallet to other markets.

00:19:58.694 --> 00:20:01.600
PENG YING: So next year?

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.750
Next two years?

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:03.520
ROBIN DUA: Stay tuned.

00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.348
Stay tuned.

00:20:04.348 --> 00:20:04.762
PENG YING: All right.

00:20:04.762 --> 00:20:06.090
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll keep
people updated.

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:07.810
We have shows every
couple of weeks.

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:08.260
PENG YING: Yeah.

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:08.680
Yeah, that's true.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:09.100
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll
let you know.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:09.930
ROBIN DUA: That's right.

00:20:09.930 --> 00:20:10.650
Exactly.

00:20:10.650 --> 00:20:12.250
You could have me back
on another show.

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:12.830
MIHAI IONESCU: We'll
definitely--

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:13.291
PENG YING: Next time, yeah.

00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:16.140
MIHAI IONESCU: --do
that, I guess.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.630
Let's talk a little bit about
other merchant-led

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:21.280
initiatives, like the
MCX initiative.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.770
If you want to talk a little
bit about it or other

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:26.140
wallet-related products.

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.270
ROBIN DUA: Sure.

00:20:27.270 --> 00:20:29.685
So this is actually a really
good point that there's going

00:20:29.685 --> 00:20:31.170
to be a lot of wallets
out there over

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:32.590
the next little while.

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:36.320
And we actually think it's a
great thing for there to be

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.810
lots of competition because it
actually makes the product

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:40.850
better at the end of the day.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:43.230
It forces everybody to really
think through what are the

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:44.910
user experiences that
people want.

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:48.795
And it forces everybody to build
better products at the

00:20:48.795 --> 00:20:50.030
end of the day.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:51.980
It also helps on two
other fronts.

00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.880
One is those wallets out there
that are taking an approach to

00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:01.140
use NFC technology in the phone
are actually going to

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.710
encourage retailers to install
contactless readers into their

00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:06.470
point-of-sale system.

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:10.195
So this will actually result
in much greater interest on

00:21:10.195 --> 00:21:12.210
the part of retailers
to upgrade

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.960
point-of-sale terminals.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.930
And the other effect that it
has is on the device side.

00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:21.900
I think OEMs are already
motivated by the exciting use

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.290
cases that NFC offers.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:30.420
But with more wallet providers
out there and consumers having

00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.660
a choice, I think OEMs will be
much more motivated to put NFC

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:35.700
into their devices.

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:40.230
So all of these things will
actually result in increased

00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:43.020
momentum around mobile payments
in the market, which

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.830
I think is a great thing
for Google as well.

00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:48.660
The other thing I just want
to highlight is from the

00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:51.110
standpoint of differentiation.

00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:53.700
We've adopted a new approach
as part of our

00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:55.230
recent Wallet release.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:57.880
We've moved the Wallet
to the cloud.

00:21:57.880 --> 00:22:01.890
And all a user's payment
credentials are now stored

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.620
securely on servers
in the cloud.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:08.050
And what this offers users the
ability to do is access their

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:11.950
Wallet through any device
and through any channel.

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:17.110
And under the old model that
we had, we were actually

00:22:17.110 --> 00:22:19.340
integrating with each
card issuer.

00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:23.470
And this integration, from the
time of negotiation to

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:24.900
integration, would take
anywhere from

00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:26.510
six months to a year.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:30.110
And under this model, the
cards were stored in the

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.220
secure element in
the NFC device.

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.180
We just didn't feel that this
model was very scalable.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:38.820
It would literally take a
lifetime to get through the

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.900
8,500 or so issuers that
are in the US.

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.980
And so by adopting this
cloud-based approach, we

00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:50.020
greatly simplified not only the
user experience because

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:53.220
now I could have a wallet with
all my cards and other

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:58.270
credentials made available to
me through any channel.

00:22:58.270 --> 00:23:02.690
But it also gives me a lot of
flexibility to transact in

00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:05.400
ways that I didn't have the
opportunity to before.

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:11.100
But also on the issuer side,
issuers are excited about the

00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.610
new cloud-based approach because
the time to market for

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:19.110
them in terms of enabling their
cards to work with NFC

00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.670
has been reduced
to almost zero.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:26.290
And in some cases, issuers could
say, I don't want to do

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.030
any integration.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:31.380
I'm happy just providing you
with card art and having my

00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.470
card represented in
the Wallet so that

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.680
consumers see my brand.

00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.570
But we also have a set of tools
and APIs that issuers

00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:42.630
could integrate if they want
to enable features like

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:46.360
enabling their users to save
cards to the Wallet directly

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:49.240
from internet banking or
mobile banking sites.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:51.790
And that's a really lightweight
integration that

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:53.540
doesn't take six months
to a year.

00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:56.140
It actually just takes a matter
of days or a few weeks

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.580
at the most.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.910
So I think this is actually
a really important point.

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:04.530
Because there are a lot of
wallet providers out there

00:24:04.530 --> 00:24:08.720
that are stuck on this approach
of let's integrate

00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:16.670
with every issuer and let's
enable this over the year,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.060
provisioning of cards to
the secure element.

00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:21.630
And it's just not a
scalable approach.

00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:24.630
And it's not going to give
consumers access to every one

00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:26.580
of their cards that they have
in their leather wallet in

00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:27.740
their phone.

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:30.020
PENG YING: So we're trying
to simplify it as much as

00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:31.140
possible for everybody.

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:31.540
ROBIN DUA: Exactly.

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:34.220
PENG YING: Ideally, it's one
click, add my card to Wallet,

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:35.610
and then you're done.

00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:36.055
ROBIN DUA: That's it.

00:24:36.055 --> 00:24:36.910
That's it.

00:24:36.910 --> 00:24:40.820
And we wanted to make the Wallet
user experience, from

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:44.900
the time of enrollment to
using it, super simple.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.160
And I think we've done that.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.445
PENG YING: Nice.

00:24:47.445 --> 00:24:48.760
Nice.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.150
So it looks like-- wow.

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:51.260
MIHAI IONESCU: Well,
we have so many

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.340
questions on the moderator.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:54.610
I was watching it while
you were talking.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.870
And I see hundreds of people,
thousands of votes.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:02.110
So I think we answered and
touched on a lot of the topics

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:03.680
in the questions here.

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.870
I'll go through a few of them
and if you can do a brief

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.960
recap of what we said.

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.350
And then I'll try to
pick a few that

00:25:11.350 --> 00:25:12.880
haven't been answered.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.710
So of course, one of the
big ones is adoption.

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.650
NFC payments seemed to be
limited to gas stations,

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:24.390
general stores, and some few
other stores out there.

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:28.910
What are we doing to encourage
merchants and other companies

00:25:28.910 --> 00:25:31.050
and vendors to adopt
Google Wallet?

00:25:31.050 --> 00:25:31.980
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:36.390
So historically, what we've
seen over the last little

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.760
while is large merchants have
typically been the ones to

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:41.850
adopt new point-of-sale
technology.

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:45.480
And this has been applicable
to contactless as well.

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:49.160
So you've seen the large
retailers integrate

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.270
contactless into their
point of sale.

00:25:51.270 --> 00:25:55.160
And now what we're starting
to see is that trend--

00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:59.260
or contactless adoption-- is
moving down market into small

00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:01.500
to midsize retailers.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.370
And the card networks, as well
as merchant acquirers, are

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:11.580
certainly pushing to get
contactless readers into those

00:26:11.580 --> 00:26:13.210
small to midsize retailers.

00:26:13.210 --> 00:26:17.390
Now from a Google perspective,
we're creating some

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:21.090
cloud-based tools that'll make
it easy for small to midsize

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:27.010
merchants to create loyalty and
coupon programs in a very

00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:33.360
inexpensive way and a very
cost-effective way that they

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.930
haven't had access to before.

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:40.570
And all of those services work
in conjunction with the

00:26:40.570 --> 00:26:42.590
contactless user experience
with the phone.

00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:47.450
So I think that, plus the fact
that the cost on the readers

00:26:47.450 --> 00:26:50.440
is actually going down quite
significantly, we're going to

00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:56.790
see greater penetration of NFC
into much smaller retailers

00:26:56.790 --> 00:26:58.265
over the next little while.

00:26:58.265 --> 00:26:58.590
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:02.220
PENG YING: And right now, it's
any retailer that accepts

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:05.370
PayPass, right, that accepts
the MasterCard PayPass, can

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:07.350
accept Google Wallet
for a tap and pay?

00:27:07.350 --> 00:27:08.160
ROBIN DUA: That's right.

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.170
That's exactly it.

00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:13.810
There's about 200,000 merchant
locations in the US that have

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:17.250
contactless readers where you
can use Google Wallet.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.110
Now, one thing to highlight is
all of these readers also

00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:24.250
accept card-based payments
with contactless.

00:27:24.250 --> 00:27:26.890
So what we're trying to do is
actually piggyback off of the

00:27:26.890 --> 00:27:30.250
existing infrastructure that
retailers already have to

00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:32.952
enable payments using
Google Wallet.

00:27:32.952 --> 00:27:36.050
MIHAI IONESCU: A very popular
question on the moderator is,

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.780
when will we be able
to pay other

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.250
individuals with Google Wallet?

00:27:40.250 --> 00:27:41.740
ROBIN DUA: Well, that's
a great question.

00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:47.570
And from our standpoint, we want
to create a wallet that

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:50.220
actually allows you to leave
your leather wallet at home.

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.950
And we've started with payment
cards, loyalty

00:27:53.950 --> 00:27:56.500
cards, and gift cards.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:59.660
We're focused on getting
other types of

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.800
credentials into the Wallet.

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.120
So that's one thing
that we're doing.

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:09.160
On the question of cash, a
wallet wouldn't be fully

00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.020
functional if it also didn't
allow users to manage their

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:19.130
currency and transact not only
with businesses, but also with

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.030
end users as well.

00:28:20.030 --> 00:28:22.850
So these are some things
that we're looking at.

00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:27.650
And from our perspective,
we recognize

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.460
that there is a need.

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:33.056
And stay tuned for some
announcements there over the

00:28:33.056 --> 00:28:33.760
next little while.

00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:34.785
PENG YING: Stay tuned.

00:28:34.785 --> 00:28:36.260
So then I don't even
need my money clip.

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.750
I can just carry around
the phone.

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:42.035
But what happens if that phone
runs out of power?

00:28:42.035 --> 00:28:44.281
ROBIN DUA: Well.

00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:46.430
PENG YING: That's a
tough question.

00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:47.450
ROBIN DUA: That is
a tough question.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.010
Battery life is getting
better.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:51.090
MIHAI IONESCU: That's
for another session.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:52.230
PENG YING: Save that
one for next time.

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:52.398
MIHAI IONESCU: Yeah.

00:28:52.398 --> 00:28:52.570
We'll save it.

00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:54.300
ROBIN DUA: Yeah, exactly.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:56.500
MIHAI IONESCU: So we have a
question here for someone who

00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.085
is both a developer
and a merchant.

00:28:58.085 --> 00:29:02.380
He uses Google Wallet on his
website to charge users but

00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:06.150
wants to take Wallet payments
from customers at local fairs.

00:29:06.150 --> 00:29:09.956
So he's selling stuff at local
fairs or the farmers market.

00:29:09.956 --> 00:29:10.800
Was that possible?

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.460
Would that be possible?

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.090
Is that possible?

00:29:12.090 --> 00:29:12.520
ROBIN DUA: Yeah.

00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.810
Absolutely.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:19.100
So if the individual has a
point-of-sale terminal, they

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.850
could actually get a contactless
reader, which

00:29:21.850 --> 00:29:24.630
would allow them to accept
contactless payments using

00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.140
cards, but also Google Wallet
payments using an NFC device.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:34.020
And there's a lot of contactless
readers that are

00:29:34.020 --> 00:29:35.740
already built into point-of-sale
terminals.

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:40.050
Some of the newer ones, it's
all fully integrated.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:42.400
But the individual
could also get a

00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.230
standalone contactless reader.

00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:46.800
Just plug it into a
point-of-sale terminal that

00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:48.470
they have for credit
card transactions.

00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:49.720
PENG YING: Right.

00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.270
I got a question here.

00:29:52.270 --> 00:30:00.420
So let's say that I'm not on one
of the supported networks.

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.950
Is there anyway for
me to use wallets?

00:30:02.950 --> 00:30:06.840
The question here is, I'm still
unable to get Google

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.000
Wallet on my Verizon
Galaxy Nexus.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.980
Will that change now that FCC
has made it clear that Verizon

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:15.230
has no right to block
applications,

00:30:15.230 --> 00:30:16.380
ie, tethering apps?

00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.960
And why is there no other
way to download?

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.410
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:22.190
So we have two carrier partners

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:24.070
today, Virgin and Sprint.

00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:28.920
And all the NFC devices
that we support

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:30.680
work on those networks.

00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.290
Now, there are a handful of NFC
devices that you could go

00:30:34.290 --> 00:30:36.700
out and buy at places
like Best Buy.

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:39.370
These are devices that
would be unlocked.

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:42.590
And you can actually use them
on the other networks and

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:46.770
download Google Wallet from the
Play store and use Google

00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:48.850
Wallet that way.

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:52.420
We are working on expanding
our carrier distribution.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:57.100
And we are actively in
negotiations with a number of

00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.760
other carriers and hope to
announce some partnerships

00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:00.260
there soon.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.810
That will also give users
the ability to use

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.016
Wallet on other networks.

00:31:04.016 --> 00:31:04.870
PENG YING: Got it.

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:05.990
Cool.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:08.170
MIHAI IONESCU: We have a
question about the Isis

00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:09.940
technology.

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:12.940
Do we have anything?

00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:13.940
PENG YING: What's
the question?

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:16.760
MIHAI IONESCU: The question
is, do you plan on

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.330
integrating, partnering with the
Isis technology that the

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:21.610
wireless carriers
are supporting?

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:23.170
ROBIN DUA: Well, Isis
has a very different

00:31:23.170 --> 00:31:25.210
approach than we do.

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:29.400
I talked a little bit about the
differentiator between our

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:33.040
cloud-based approach and the
approach where a number of

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.080
other wallet providers, and Isis
included, are working on

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.860
direct provisioning of cards
from an issuer to the secure

00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:45.610
element, in their case,
the SIM in the phone.

00:31:45.610 --> 00:31:48.530
We just don't think that model
is scalable for the simple

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:52.130
reason that, as I mentioned
earlier, there's 8,500

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.700
issuers in the US.

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:58.500
And it literally will take them
a lifetime to actually

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:01.070
work through negotiations
with all these issuers.

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:03.540
And keep in mind, it's not just
about getting payment

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:04.880
cards into the phone.

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.190
People want a wallet that works
with loyalty, with gift

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.910
cards, with identification,
boarding passes, with all

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.570
these other credential types.

00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:17.020
And we think what we've done
is made it super simple for

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.560
you to store any of
these digital

00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.110
objects into the Wallet.

00:32:20.110 --> 00:32:22.240
We obviously don't have support
for all of them today,

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.740
but we're working
towards that.

00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.820
And we just think the
cloud-based approach that

00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:32.100
we've adopted is better for the
end user, but also better

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:33.350
for partners.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:36.910
PENG YING: I have another one.

00:32:36.910 --> 00:32:39.980
I want to use Google Wallet to
pay for bus and train rides.

00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.580
Will Google be working with
Metro to have this become a

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.710
possibility?

00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:47.400
ROBIN DUA: So transit is a
really important use case.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:52.650
And people ride transit
systems daily,

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.150
multiple times a day.

00:32:54.150 --> 00:32:58.390
And there's a great opportunity
here to simplify

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:00.660
the payment experience because
I've always got my phone in my

00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:01.960
pocket or on my waist.

00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:08.030
And just taking it out and
tapping is a great way to

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:10.700
simplify the user experience so
I don't have to fumble and

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.550
find my card in my wallet.

00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:18.280
But also, there's an added
benefit which is buying a pass

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.200
through the Wallet becomes
a lot easier.

00:33:20.200 --> 00:33:23.090
I don't have to go to the local
convenience store or

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.890
stand in line at the metro
station to actually buy a pass

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.250
every month.

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.370
I could actually do that through
the Wallet over the

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.560
next little while.

00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:32.480
I could also see--

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:36.550
if it's a stored value type of
pass, I could see the balance

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.020
on the pass.

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:40.370
So these are some of
the reasons why

00:33:40.370 --> 00:33:42.850
transit is really important.

00:33:42.850 --> 00:33:47.700
And we're certainly working
towards getting transit passes

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.160
into the Wallet as well.

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:51.510
PENG YING: Cool.

00:33:51.510 --> 00:33:53.500
MIHAI IONESCU: I have a question
about someone who

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.540
wants to use the ATM
with the Wallet.

00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.560
Can we add ATM cards
to the Wallet?

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:03.590
And have we talked with any
ATM manufacturers to use

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.070
Wallet on ATM machines?

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:07.110
ROBIN DUA: There's been some
discussion about ATM

00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:10.790
manufacturers integrating
contactless or NFC technology

00:34:10.790 --> 00:34:12.929
into the ATMs.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.350
We think it's probably a
little bit further out.

00:34:15.350 --> 00:34:17.495
It's not something that we're
focused on at this point.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:23.684
PENG YING: So this guy
has a suggestion.

00:34:23.684 --> 00:34:26.900
But I think we cover the cases
already right now, but I'm not

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.630
quite sure.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:30.860
So the question is, I'd like
to integrate location-based

00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:33.840
awareness to Wallet and
adding retailers.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:36.590
When I go to Starbucks, I
want my card to pop up

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:38.170
and Wallet to pay.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:42.030
When I go to movie theater,
I'd like my AMC card to be

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:44.179
integrated so I can
pay with Wallet.

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:48.190
I feel like we would pass both
if they're already integrated

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:49.560
with our APIs, right?

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:50.050
ROBIN DUA: Yeah.

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:54.420
I think what the user's
referring to is how can we

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:58.670
simplify the user experience so
that maybe the relevant set

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:03.650
of gift cards or coupons
actually pop up when I'm in

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:06.340
that store or in the vicinity
of that store.

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:13.340
Location-based services using
geo-fencing or GPS technology

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:15.800
is something that we're
actively looking at.

00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:19.460
And we're always working towards
simplifying the user

00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:24.410
experience so that you don't
have to do things with as many

00:35:24.410 --> 00:35:25.310
clicks on the phone.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:29.420
So, you won't have to, as an
example, go in, find the

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:32.630
Wallet application, launch
it, and then go

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.690
into the right tab.

00:35:33.690 --> 00:35:37.760
It would automatically pop up on
the main screen when you're

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.250
in that store.

00:35:39.250 --> 00:35:43.510
So these are some of the things
that we're looking to

00:35:43.510 --> 00:35:45.350
simplify in terms of
user experience.

00:35:45.350 --> 00:35:49.390
And you'll start to see
enhancements to the product

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:51.430
over the next little while
that'll take advantage of

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:53.180
location-based services.

00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:53.460
PENG YING: Cool.

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:54.990
Let's do two more questions
and then--

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.473
MIHAI IONESCU: Two
more question--

00:35:55.473 --> 00:35:55.956
PENG YING: --call it a day.

00:35:55.956 --> 00:35:59.360
MIHAI IONESCU: --and yeah, we're
running out of time.

00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:03.650
So we got quite a few questions
about loyalty cards

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.400
and the discount programs.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.330
I know you touched on it
a little bit earlier.

00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:11.650
Can you summarize what we're
doing along those lines and

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:16.180
make it easier for both
merchants and users to very

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:19.030
easily use all kind of coupons
and loyalty points?

00:36:19.030 --> 00:36:19.710
ROBIN DUA: Right.

00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:22.720
So I talked a little bit about
the Save to Wallet button that

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.440
we launched at Google I/O, which
allows a user to save

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.650
offers to their Wallet.

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:34.140
And we also enabled the Save to
Wallet button to work for

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:36.620
issuer cards directly through
internet banking, as well as

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:39.160
mobile banking applications.

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.190
You could imagine a whole
ecosystem being built around

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.720
that Save to Wallet button.

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:48.170
So it becomes a lot easier
when you are on a partner

00:36:48.170 --> 00:36:52.580
website and you want to actually
save, whether it's a

00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.040
boarding pass or a loyalty
card or a gift

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.940
card, to the Wallet.

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.090
And we're looking at opening
those APIs to other partners

00:37:03.090 --> 00:37:06.270
so that things like loyalty
cards, like you mentioned,

00:37:06.270 --> 00:37:09.640
will become easier to be
saved to the Wallet.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.400
The other thing that we're
doing just on the loyalty

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:16.240
front is we want to make it
really easy for retailers to

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:19.480
create their own loyalty
programs using

00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.610
tools that we offer.

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:25.590
So we're looking to create
some cloud-based services

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:28.750
that'll allow small merchants,
but also the largest

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.350
retailers, to actually take
advantage of tools to

00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:35.020
customize loyalty programs so
that they don't have to invest

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:39.660
in software and point-of-sale
infrastructure to enable

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.420
loyalty programs.

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:42.080
PENG YING: There you go.

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:42.640
MIHAI IONESCU: One more.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.370
PENG YING: And then last one.

00:37:44.370 --> 00:37:48.380
You know, I've read a few
stories with events kind of

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.580
similar to this, but this
one's a good one.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:53.150
I've been to McDonald's and
I tried to pay with Google

00:37:53.150 --> 00:37:54.180
Wallet three times.

00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:56.330
It's only worked once.

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:57.890
Are there any issues
with stability?

00:37:57.890 --> 00:38:02.000
Or what are we doing to
make it more stable?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.780
ROBIN DUA: There are some retail
locations where there

00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:08.050
may be some issues with the
contactless reader.

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:11.990
We would encourage the user to
report those issues to the

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.250
retailer themselves so they
could actually address those

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.070
reader issues.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.710
Users could also log
an issue through

00:38:20.710 --> 00:38:22.590
the application itself.

00:38:22.590 --> 00:38:25.600
We've got a section in the
application, in the help

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:27.920
section, where users could
report issues that they're

00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:32.930
encountering related to these
types of reader issues.

00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:37.300
We're working with merchants,
the card networks, acquirers

00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.090
to address proactively
any reader

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.300
issues that are surfaced.

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:48.780
We are looking for ways to
implement more automated

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.400
technology to detect reader
issues with some of our

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.100
partners and trying to address
these problems much, much

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.590
faster so that users don't
encounter issues like that.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:01.885
PENG YING: Got it.

00:39:01.885 --> 00:39:02.180
ROBIN DUA: All right.

00:39:02.180 --> 00:39:02.560
MIHAI IONESCU: Good.

00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:02.940
PENG YING: And with that.

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.000
MIHAI IONESCU: So we'll
wrap up here.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.370
Thank you, everyone,
for watching.

00:39:06.370 --> 00:39:10.290
And of course, thanks, Robin,
for graciously agreeing to

00:39:10.290 --> 00:39:12.500
come on the session.

00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:15.070
Remember, this is available
on Google

00:39:15.070 --> 00:39:16.570
Developers channel on YouTube.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.920
You can watch it anytime
you want.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.600
We have sessions every
two weeks.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.670
And we hope to see Robin again
soon on a another session.

00:39:24.670 --> 00:39:26.320
ROBIN DUA: Well, thanks very
much for having me, guys.

00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:30.980
And to all of you watching, go
to google.com/wallet and sign

00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.140
up for a Wallet account there.

00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:32.670
MIHAI IONESCU: All right.

00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:33.380
OK.

00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.150
PENG YING: See you
in two weeks.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.780
MIHAI IONESCU: See
you in two weeks.

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.030
Bye.
