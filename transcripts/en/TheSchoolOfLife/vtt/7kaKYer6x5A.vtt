00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.499
In the west we generally expect philosophy to come from books.In the east,more wisely,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.549
There's an awareness that it may also come from other things. For example:

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.689
rocks

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.309
this is a brief history of a remarkable Eastern tradition of

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.160
Philosophical Rock appreciation

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:32.849
826 AD, Tang Dynasty, Lake Tai, Jiangsu Province, China

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:39.029
A middle-aged gentleman is taking a stroll around a large lake on the yangtze Delta plain in Eastern China

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.459
When something on its shore catches his eye

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.579
It's an apparently trivial yet momentous discovery : a pair of oddly shaped rocks

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.469
This is perhaps no less than the founding moment in Chinese petro-philia. This cultivated pedestrian is someone special

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.799
After numerous ups and downs in his career as a state official,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.339
Including periods of imperial disfavor in exile, Baidu  has finally made it. He's been appointed

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.040
prefect of the nearby city of Xu Zhu. He also happens to be one of China's major Poets.

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:18.508
It's not a chance combination of talents. The ideal administrator doesn't just know maths and timekeeping. In China

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:25.049
He's meant to be a man of learning and the arts. Many of China's leading poets and painters have careers in public service.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.849
So struck is Baidu by these rocks with their twisted angles and perforations that he has them taken back home to Xu Zhu.

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.249
Soon after his return he sits down and writes a poem about them : A pair of rocks.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.270
Baidu starts by admitting that the rocks are not typically beautiful:

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.849
Dark sallow, two slates of rocks, their appearance is grotesque and ugly

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.679
They're also covered in dirt and begrimed with smoke. Their cavity's thick with green moss.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.919
He describes himself washing and scrubbing them. Such as what is the value of these unprepossessing specimens?

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.589
Daoism which began as a philosophy in ancient China, before turning into a popular religion,

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.190
cherishes nature and it's evidence of Nature's Force that Baidu welcomes in these rocks. The holes

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.570
perforations and indentations sing the patient mighty forces of the universe which we should respect, admire, and

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.159
attempt to find harmony with. The ancient rocks are also a consolation for an

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.199
Ageing-by, who feels excluded from the world of youngsters. As he writes:

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.140
Turning my head around I ask the pair of rocks

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.179
"Can you keep company with an old man like myself?"  Athough the rocks cannot speak they promise that we will be three friends.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.209
Thanks to Baidu's enthusiasm and poetic talent a wave of interest in rocks follows.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.520
12th Century AD, Northern Song Dynasty, Wu Wei District, China

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:57.540
Mi Fu, another rather eccentric scholar official has just been appointed as a magistrate in Wu-Wei County.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.630
On arrival he has to pay an important social visit.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.610
He's been invited to meet and greet all the other important administrators with whom he'll be working.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.820
They stand waiting for him in the front garden of the official residence

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.130
But as he walks towards them they're shocked at a sudden breach of protocol on his behalf

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.929
For he's been stopped in his tracks by an unusually large rock in the garden

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:26.309
instead of offering his respects to his hosts, Mi Fu turns and bows ceremoniously to the rock, then addresses it as

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.239
"Elder brother rock" and makes an elaborate speech in its honor

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.880
Only after fully expressing his devotion to this amazing rock does Mi finally turn to his

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:37.269
flabbergasted hosts.

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.929
It was this story that earned Mi Fu his soubriquet :

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.889
"Crazy Mi" and captured the imagination of East Asia's painters for whom Mi Fu and Elder Brother Rock

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.979
Remained a favorite image for centuries to come.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.469
Mi Fu goes on to write a treatise on rocks that enumerates four main aesthetic qualities

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.839
he detects in them:  1) Su -an elegant and upright stature 2) Zu -a wrinkled

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.729
in-furrow texture 3)Lu - or cracks that are like channels or paths through the Rock and

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.169
4) Tu - the holes in the rock that allow air and light to pass through. In

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:16.978
The Eleventh and twelfth Century, Chinese Northern song Dynasty the passion for collecting rocks among scholar officials like Mi Fu

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.029
Takes off in earnest. Stones are mounted on wooden bases and placed on desks as constant sources of inspiration.

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.909
The decorative stones become known as "Gongshi" -

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.780
Spirit Stones

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.799
Popularly mistranslated as "Scholars Rocks" in English.

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:40.020
They're peculiarly twisted Shapes are admired as evidence of the Qi energy that is believed to animate nature and the human body alike.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.219
Any cultivated person is expected to have an appreciation of rocks

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.509
They're valued quite as highly as any painting or calligraphic scroll.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.500
During the song Dynasty, the most favored rocks are quarried from the Limestone of Lingbi be in the Northern Anhui province.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.039
Lingbi rocks are dark black and glossy in texture.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.399
January 1127 AD, end of the Northern Song Dynasty, Kaifeng, Northern China

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:12.689
The imperial capital of China, Kaifeng, is under siege and about to fall to the Jurchens, a nomadic people from Manchuria.

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:18.300
Soon the Song Emperor Huizong will be taken captive and forced to abdicate, while his son

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:22.889
Qinzong will flee to the south to establish a new court and the Southern song Dynasty.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:30.870
China will be split in two. In his desperate final days of the Northern Song, the order is given for the trees in Huizong's

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.440
spectacular imperial Garden at Kaifeng to be cut down for

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:41.879
firewood and for its incredible array of fabulous rocks to be pulled out of the ground and used in catapults against the invaders.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.609
It's a sad end to what was reputed to have been one of the most remarkable gardens in World history

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:51.239
The Royal Park is said to have been teeming with striking rocks

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.009
but emperor Huizong's passion for rocks has clearly got rather out of hand and

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:00.658
explains his neglect of security issues. Huizong had in previous years

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.209
Appointed a royal official to explore the whole of China in search of precious rocks for his garden

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:12.479
Tales are bounded of his officials abuse. It's said that he dismantled a bridge to let boats with huge rocks

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.770
Pass by on a particular canal a love of rocks appears to have hastened the collapse of the Northern Song Empire.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.030
1450 AD, Muromachi Period ,Japan

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:32.430
In 15th Century Japan a new type of Rock Garden develops. As with much in Chinese culture the obsession with rocks has crossed over to Japan

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:40.019
But has been adapted there in a particular way. In Japan the spirit rocks are called "Soseki" and the Japanese favor much more subdued

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.520
smooth rocks than the Chinese.

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.139
In Japan, rocks are treasured for their weathered appearance that exemplifies the worn simplicity of the aesthetic known as "Wabi-sabi".

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.919
in Japan the rocks are not so much placed on wooden stands as

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.699
positioned in trays surrounded by sand or water and are meant to evoke mountains and corresponding lakes.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:07.439
At several Zen Buddhist temples and most remarkably at Ryōan-ji in Kyoto the stones start to be set in very minimal settings

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:15.239
So as to emphasize their qualities. The raking of the gravel around the rocks by Temple monks grows into a careful and precise art.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:19.650
There are various patterns ones meant to use, including the "water pattern of

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.979
Concentric rings"- or ripples, like those produced when a stone is dropped in a lake. "The stormy water pattern"of

00:07:26.199 --> 00:07:33.239
Haphazardly overlapping semi circles and "the continuous wave effect" of parallel or gently undulating lines.

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:37.228
The originator of the East Asian Reverence for Rocks , Baidu,

00:07:37.539 --> 00:07:41.879
Was well aware of how powerful a love of rocks can become. In his essay

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:49.289
"Account of the Lake Tai rock" he speaks of an addiction that some rocks can bring about. "Truly wise people should", he says,

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.410
"Restrict their rock worship to a few hours a day".

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:59.159
When few of us spend more than a few minutes a year looking at a rock the advice seems less than urgent

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.000
Indeed the tradition of Rock reverence has a lot to teach us

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.090
That wisdom can hang off bits of the natural world

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:11.039
Just as well as issuing from books. That we need to surround ourselves with objects that embody

00:08:11.169 --> 00:08:14.579
Certain values we're in danger of losing sight of day to day

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:19.169
And that some of our most precious moments can be spent in the presence of nothing more chatty,

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:23.339
prestigious, or costly than an old stone ripe with years.

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480
