00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.660
MATT PARKER: Ok, there is a new world record largest
prime number ever just announced

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.200
yesterday and today I had a special
delivery, this arrived in the post.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.099
In here we have the newly discovered Mersenne prime. In here is 2 to the power of

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.600
74,207,281 (make sure I get that right)
and if you actually were

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.900
BRADY HARAN: Minus one?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.100
MATT PARKER: Minus one. Trivial at that size.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.200
If you were actually to print
this number out it's 22 million, it's

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.420
over 22 million digits. It's around 22,338,618

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:44.100
digits and no one would be foolish
enough to get that printed and shipped to

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.239
them the moment the number was announced,
other than us, so let's get in there!

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.400
[Cutting]

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.600
MATT PARKER: There it is! There it is!

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.800
This is the new world record, look at that!

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.800
That is 2 to the power of 74,207,281 minus 1. These are the digits, Volume II. Volume II of III.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.000
So there's Volume III, and so there's
another third and finally here I guess

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.300
we should start at the beginning, this is,
there you are, Volume... I.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.200
Look at that! This is the new prime number! This is... we

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.090
suspect we are, well we're definitely the
first people to have ever printed it out. I suspect

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.229
we're still the only people to have ever
printed it out because that is over two

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:39.090
million digits printed in tiny, tiny
type. I went for a monospaced typeface to

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.200
make it easier to locate the digits
within there, oh there's a mistake! Ah there's not

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.260
Right, so

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.710
I don't think people get very excited when a new prime number's found, but very rarely do you

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.720
actually get to pick it up and hold it.
So that's... that is some serious, they are some

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.860
weighty... that is some weighty mathem-
look at that! Look at the size of that number!

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.260
And this, obviously I'm environmentally
friendly, I wanna waste paper, so it's front and back.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.500
Now, finding prime numbers
is a common hobby for

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.100
mathematicians and you know for millennia,

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.600
thousands and
thousands of years,

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.000
mathematicians have been obsessed with finding prime numbers,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.459
numbers with no factors
and now, it's getting harder

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.700
and harder to break the world record of
the biggest prime number ever found and

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.129
so the previous world record was three
years ago and if anyone has been

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.420
watching Numberphile videos for that long
you remember we covered it. Tony did a

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.890
video on the previous world record and that
record stood for three years and now we

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.140
have another one but they're getting so
much harder to find and so this one is

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.959
almost five million digits longer than
the previous one and so it's gone from

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.299
around 17 million up to around 22
million, you think thats not a... it's a decent job, but don't forget

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:54.870
every digit, the number is 10 times the
size and so that's another five million

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:01.200
orders of magnitude bigger. I mean, that's
just off the scale. So, the

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.900
record has now been taken by Professor Curtis Cooper.
He's at the University of Central Missouri

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.670
and he was running loads of
computers there. He found this prime, he

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.090
won the world record off the previous
holder which was Professor Curtis Cooper

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.200
of the University of Central Missouri so
he's won, it's his fourth! He's.... he's hogging them

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.760
to be entire- I mean I... I run the software
too. I really want to find a world record

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.130
I'd be happy with anything in the top
100 biggest known primes but no he's

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.220
hogging the top spot and so he found two
in a pair about a decade ago and then

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.900
someone else got the world record back
and then he regained the world record

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.459
three years ago and now he's just
cemented his position. He is

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.870
Captain Prime. So the way this works if
you wanna try and find the biggest prime

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.380
known to humankind is you just, you don't
have to do anything really, you download a bit of

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.250
software and you run it on your computer.
So, as we speak there's a computer in my

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.530
office running a bit of software to try and find
prime numbers and some central server

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.030
will send your computer a candidate
number. Your computer will then check it

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.390
to see if it's prime or not, and, more
often than not, for the vast majority, not prime!

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.299
So you send it back and go "Sorry
guys, not prime", very occasionally you'll

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:16.799
be sent a number your computer will
check it, you won't even know. You'll be out and

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.200
about and a number like this takes about a month,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.420
so your computer will sit there for a
month on a number like this. At the very

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.610
end... it's not gonna be prime. But, very rarely,
if it comes in prime it gets sent back

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.380
and officially you found it, it's your
record. The policy is a number only

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:40.100
counts as a world record prime once it's
been seen by a human,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.680
because obviously this number's always existed.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.500
This number predates our universe so it's
not like we've invented it, we've just

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.830
spotted it and so your computer finding it
is not enough. When it gets flagged up

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.690
that it exists and human goes, "Hey, check it out!"
That's when it officially counts as a

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:00.570
new prime number and, so yes you can win, well there's
a prize, but that's beside the point.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.740
You can win, you know, accolades and
recognition as The Finder. I'm so envious!

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.900
BRADY HARAN: Sounds like a lottery, winning it, and yet
this one guy's won it four times. What's his secret?

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.980
MATT PARKER: It does sound like a lottery doesn't it, that they're just handing out numbers err...

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.810
Curtis's secret is he has a lot of
computers. So he's running it on 800 desktop

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.700
computers. So he had a chat with the
people at the University of Central Missouri and said

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.200
"Look, all your computers, you've got them
running in the labs around the night,

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.410
like they're on 24 hours," because
apparently it's easier to push updates

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.400
and things to the computers and so they
deliberately keep them on.

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.340
And he goes, "We don't waste all that computing power."

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.100
And so they agreed to let him put the

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.050
Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search or
G.I.M.P.S. for shorthand, terrible,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.100
Ah, if you're gonna look it up online, don't Google...
type out all of "Great Internet Mersenne

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:55.320
Prime Search" and he put it on all the computers.
And so for the 800 computers at the

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:59.220
university there, whenever they're not
being used they kick in and start doing

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.890
this. So some computer sat there for a month,
during the day it was helping people learn,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.060
people were coming in using it for assignments
and university work and at night when everyone

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.580
turned the lights out, it would fire
back up again, it would reopen this number

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.850
and go "Right where am I up to?" right and then it
would carry on and it would check if it is

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.660
prime or not, and for one of them it
suddenly... ding! At the end result, it

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.930
was prime and got sent off to the server.
Absolutely incredible!

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.250
MATT PARKER: The 12th term in the Lucas-Lehmer sequence, but we only have to find it mod 8191.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.700
So to start with it's the same, you have 4
you'd square that, you would get 14 you'll square that...
