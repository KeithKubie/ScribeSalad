To check whether both of them are 3, you want to check whether the first one is

00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:09.862
3 and the second one is 3. In a condition, that would look like x equals,

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:15.356
equals 3 and, and y equals, equals 3. To check whether at least one of them is

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:21.280
3, you want to know if one is 3 or the other is 3. So, x equals, equals 3 or

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.433
which is the vertical bar twice, y equals, equals 3.
