00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.440
Guys, Trace is SUCH a Neanderthal!

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.440
No really.

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:06.550
He’s 3% Neanderthal and makes excellent
rock art.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.080
I made this.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.280
Hi guys, it’s Natalia for DNews!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.230
Calling someone a Neanderthal has long been
an insult- you might as well call them a brutish

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.250
half-wit, devoid of smarts &amp; sophistication,
however there’s now overwhelming scientific

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.830
evidence- from art, to burials, to Neanderthal
DNA found in many of our own species- it’s

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.170
clear Neanderthals were more intelligent,
innovative, &amp; frisky with our ancestors than

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.489
previously thought.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.780
Hey, how you doin’?

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.040
Nice man bun!

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.690
Neanderthals, yes, it’s pronounced with
a hard “T”, were discovered in 1856 in

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.789
Neander Valley near Dusseldorf, Germany.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.690
They lived during the climatically rough ice
age and were traditionally called cave men,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.350
since many sites associated with them have
been in or near caves.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.799
They were distributed throughout Europe and
the Middle East from roughly 430,000 to 40,000

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:57.819
years ago.

00:00:57.819 --> 00:01:01.569
Ever since their discovery, scientists have
tried to understand these hominin relatives

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.780
and often wondered about their fate.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.460
Some researchers believed humans outcompeted
Neanderthals or that they died out from disease,

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700
ultimately being replaced by us humans.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.200
While other paleoanthropologists surmised
that Neanderthals and anatomically modern

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.810
humans admixed or (ahem) got down.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.770
And once geneticists were able to sequence
the Neanderthal genome, we know that this

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:22.770
is true.

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
In fact, many Europeans have traces of Neanderthal
DNA, like Trace.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.870
So we know that humans mated with Neanderthals,
but did they possess anything like human culture?

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.070
What was Neanderthal life like?

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.359
Humans have long held the belief that what
makes our species unique was ‘culture’.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.710
Culture is often defined by shared and learned
behavior, values, and technology from language,

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.039
art, tools, and ideology.

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.210
Until recent decades, it was unclear whether
Neanderthals possessed ‘culture’.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.289
Research shows that Neanderthals hunted in
groups and exploited megafauna successfully,

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.810
like mammoths and woolly rhinoceroses.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.280
Neanderthals were not only proficient hunters,
according the dental calculus on their teeth,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.070
or tartar, they were also good foragers.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.139
They cooked and ate a diet that included vegetables
and grains.

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:11.480
And researchers also found traces of plants
with no nutritional value but have medicinal

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.530
properties, like yarrow and camomile.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.680
Who knew tartar build up could be so informative!

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.549
There is also evidence that Neanderthals cared
for their sick and injured and buried their

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.319
dead, even leaving them offerings, thus showing
investment and care.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.010
Red ochre, a clay containing hematite, was
also used by Neanderthals for personal decoration

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.370
as far back as 250,000 years ago.

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.099
As for technology, Neanderthals are associated
with the Mousterian stone ‘tool kit’ and

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:39.620
the more sophisticated Chatelperronian tools.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.689
Which included blades that could double as
projectile points.

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.651
And new research coming out of a cave in Southwest
France asserts that Neanderthals also were

00:02:46.651 --> 00:02:48.010
keen on making art!

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.160
Bruniquel Cave had been sealed for millennia
and was discovered in 1990 by a French archaeologist.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.189
But it wasn’t until twenty-three years later,
in 2013, that a team of archaeologists returned

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:00.680
to Bruniquel to conduct a full excavation.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.420
Since the start of its excavation, researchers
have found six rock structures in the form

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.629
of circles made from cave stalagmites.

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.799
The stalagmite are broken in roughly 2 foot-
long pieces and all structures show evidence

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.299
of fire on the stalagmites.

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.329
Interestly, they were found more that 330
meters from the cave’s entrance and thought

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.799
to have been moved to this location and then
assembled there.

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.410
This meant there had to have been forethought
before assembling these circles and they used

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.769
fire to light their way.

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.629
Scientists have dated the structures back
176,000 years.

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.000
This predates the presence of modern humans
in Europe!

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.150
The question of WHY these structures were
built is a bit more difficult to answer.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.939
Researchers have some theories, including
that these circles had symbolic and ritual

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:45.409
significance, the circles were used to keep
bears at bay, or the circles were elaborate

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:46.409
fire pits.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.209
So this may very well be proof of ancient
Neanderthal culture!

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.720
So now we know about a bit more about Neanderthal
culture, here’s a video of Trace discussing

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.829
Neanderthal talking!

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:09.069
So do you have any Neanderthal DNA?

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.140
And given the chance, would you date a Neanderthal?

Well, maybe...Thanks for watching!
