00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.610
Well, I had to stop that
last presentation because

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.630
I ran out of time.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.010
But now we can start up
right where we left off.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.490
So far, we had figured out the
slope and it made sense to

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.350
us because we figured out
the slope was minus 4/3.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.250
You could look at it two ways.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.960
When the run is 3, the
rise is negative 4.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.730
So rise we went down by
negative 4, we ran 3, and

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.310
you can keep doing that on
the line and you'll keep

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.340
ending up on the line.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
You could've also gone down
8 and then moved over 6.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.250
Or you could move over
6 and go down 8.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.640
If you went down 8 you
would've showed up here.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.660
Then you would've
come down back here.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.880
Whatever the slope is, if you
change the y by the rise, and

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.010
you change the run by the
x, you should end up

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.360
on the line again.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.420
I know I'm doing this over
and over again, but I think

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.730
it'll slowly sink in.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.030
But anyway, where we left off
we were going to solve for b so

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.090
that we could figure out the
final equation for this line.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:57.780
Well, just like we did the
last time, we just have to

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.240
substitute a y or an x that
we know works for this line.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.100
We know either of these
coordinates will work,

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.600
and then we solve for b.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.500
Let's try this first one:
2 comma negative 3.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.585
So y is negative 3.

00:01:10.585 --> 00:01:13.070
Don't get confused
between x and y.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.980
y is negative 3 equals minus
4/3 times x, which is 2.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.570
Plus b.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.600
And then we get negative 3
equals negative 8/3 plus b.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.950
And then we get b is equal to--
well, 3 is equal to minus 9/3.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.130
And then I'm just going to
put this on the other side.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.040
So that's plus 8/3.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.270
So we get minus 1/3
is the y-intercept.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.740
So the equation of this line is
y is equal to minus 4/3 x and

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.430
then this y-intercept
is minus 1/3.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.110
I know this is extremely messy,
but the equation of this line

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.150
once again, is y equals
minus 4/3 x minus 1/3.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.920
Now let's look at the graph
and see if that makes sense.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.870
Well, let's see.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.810
The y-intercept is right here.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:13.070
That's where you intersect
the y-axis at the point.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.320
And we would know exactly
what that point is.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.700
It's 0 comma negative 1/3.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.585
That's the y-intercept,
and it makes sense.

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:23.770
And even when you look at an
equation it's pretty obvious

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.780
that this is going to be the
y-intercept because when x

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.530
equals 0 this term
gets crossed out.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.090
Because 0 times negative 4/3.

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.740
And then y would
equal negative 1/3.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.130
Let's do one more
just to bore you.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.790
And because my wife is a
resident and she works 30

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.150
hours of time and I have
nothing better to do.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.280
All right.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.060
Let me put that
graph back there.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.000
I joke, but you don't
realize that it's true.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.810
Let's put the graph back
there and I'm going to do

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.770
another random points.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.570
I'm going to go a little
faster this time.

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:05.560
So let's say I had negative 8
comma 5 and I had-- let me

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.840
think of a good one-- 2
comma-- I'm just going

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.140
to make up a number.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.790
2 comma, let's say 0.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:20.800
That's interesting.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.560
2 comma 0.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.440
So let's graph
negative 8 comma 5.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.670
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.070
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:35.240
Right there is minus 8 comma 5.

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.270
And then 1, 2, and
then 0 is right here.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.940
So that's 2 comma 0.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.415
And now let me draw the line.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.740
Oh my God.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:48.770
I thought I was using
the line tool.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.350
That's horrendous.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.210
I wish there was an undo tool.

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.160
That was horrendous.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.300
That was unacceptable.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.452
That's a little bit better.

00:03:59.452 --> 00:04:01.460
Just so you know that the
line doesn't end there.

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.190
Lines go on forever and ever
in the coordinate axis.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.480
There you go.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.390
OK.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.770
So let's figure out the
slope of this line.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.420
Well, change in y
over change in x.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.785
I'm using the line tool again.

00:04:14.785 --> 00:04:15.995
I'm a spaz today.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.940
Let's take this as
a starting point.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.140
We'll get 5 minus 0.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.430
y sub 1 minus y sub 2.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.770
Over x sub 1-- minus 8 minus 2.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.650
So it equals 5 over minus 10.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.730
And that equals minus 1/2.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.372
So that means for every 2
we go over, we go down 1.

00:04:39.372 --> 00:04:43.150
Well, for every 1 we go
down, we go over 2,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.800
which makes sense.

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.410
If we go down 2,
we'll go over 4.

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.743
Because 2/4 is the
same thing as 1/2.

00:04:49.743 --> 00:04:51.330
I hope that makes sense to you.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.630
I know this is a
downwards sloping line.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.600
So that was fast.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.230
So we know that the equation
of the line so far is y is

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:02.170
equal to minus 1/2 x plus b.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.520
Now we just solve for b.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.100
Let's substitute some
numbers in here.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:06.840
Well, let's use this one.

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.610
This is interesting: 2 comma 0.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.620
So y is 0.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.280
Equals minus 1/2
times 2 plus b.

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.130
Well, 0 is equal to and
this is minus 1 plus b.

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.180
And we get b equals 1.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.050
This is a pretty easy problem.

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:29.320
So now we get y is equal
to minus 1/2 x plus 1.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.110
OK, now let's see if this
actually looks right

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.890
on our problem.

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.210
Well, this is telling us
that the y-intercept

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.310
is at the point 0, 1.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.030
0, 1 is right here.

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:44.960
And our algebra
confirms our drawing.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.320
This is the y-intercept
and we see that the

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:48.990
slope is negative 1/2.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.590
It makes sense because it's
a downward sloping line,

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:52.726
but it's not too steep.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.340
For every 1 that we go
down, we go over 2.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.200
So that's negative 1/2.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:05.580
Or you could say for every 2
we run, we rise negative 1.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.810
Either one, we end
up on a line again.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.280
So I hope that helps.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.130
I think you are definitely
ready to do a lot of these

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.450
slope problems that we
have on the Khan Academy.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:17.690
So I hope you have fun and if
you any questions you can

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.410
attend one of the seminars.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.330
Have fun.
