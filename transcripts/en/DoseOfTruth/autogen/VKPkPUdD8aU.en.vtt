how should you behave on Twitter I think

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659
how should you behave on Twitter I think
 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.499
how should you behave on Twitter I think
Twitter drives me a little bit crazy you

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509
Twitter drives me a little bit crazy you
 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.259
Twitter drives me a little bit crazy you
know I'm on it a fair bit I'm not sure

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
know I'm on it a fair bit I'm not sure
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.270
know I'm on it a fair bit I'm not sure
it's a good thing and I tend to

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280
it's a good thing and I tend to
 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.810
it's a good thing and I tend to
distribute things that are alarming

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820
distribute things that are alarming
 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.490
distribute things that are alarming
let's say in some sense maybe they are

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500
let's say in some sense maybe they are
 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.010
let's say in some sense maybe they are
alarming ideological or ideologically

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020
alarming ideological or ideologically
 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.410
alarming ideological or ideologically
they're disturbing and I was thinking

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420
they're disturbing and I was thinking
 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.029
they're disturbing and I was thinking
about that today in preparation for this

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039
about that today in preparation for this
 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.859
about that today in preparation for this
talk and I wasn't really sure that was

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869
talk and I wasn't really sure that was
 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.920
talk and I wasn't really sure that was
necessarily a good idea because there

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930
necessarily a good idea because there
 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.689
necessarily a good idea because there
are a lot of alarming things happening

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699
are a lot of alarming things happening
 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.139
are a lot of alarming things happening
all the time everywhere obviously and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149
all the time everywhere obviously and
 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.350
all the time everywhere obviously and
now we can share all of them always all

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360
now we can share all of them always all
 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.350
now we can share all of them always all
the time and so that means that instead

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360
the time and so that means that instead
 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.150
the time and so that means that instead
of hearing about one alarming thing a

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
of hearing about one alarming thing a
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.860
of hearing about one alarming thing a
day you're hearing about like 500

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870
day you're hearing about like 500
 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.260
day you're hearing about like 500
alarming things a day and so then you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270
alarming things a day and so then you
 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.819
alarming things a day and so then you
know what are you supposed to do about

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829
know what are you supposed to do about
 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.529
know what are you supposed to do about
that is that does that indicate the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539
that is that does that indicate the
 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.110
that is that does that indicate the
state that there's a state of emergency

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120
state that there's a state of emergency
 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.189
state that there's a state of emergency
well you don't know because you don't

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199
well you don't know because you don't
 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.319
well you don't know because you don't
know how to calibrate the information so

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329
know how to calibrate the information so
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.610
know how to calibrate the information so
I was thinking well maybe the right way

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620
I was thinking well maybe the right way
 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.889
I was thinking well maybe the right way
to behave on Twitter is only to forward

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899
to behave on Twitter is only to forward
 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.720
to behave on Twitter is only to forward
good things that are happening you know

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730
good things that are happening you know
 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.010
good things that are happening you know
because there's lots of good things that

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020
because there's lots of good things that
 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.810
because there's lots of good things that
are happening but I actually don't know

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820
are happening but I actually don't know
 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.759
are happening but I actually don't know
the answer to that I have no idea and I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
the answer to that I have no idea and I
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.380
the answer to that I have no idea and I
don't think anybody else does either I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390
don't think anybody else does either I
 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359
don't think anybody else does either I
do know that there are studies with

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369
do know that there are studies with
 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.130
do know that there are studies with
regards to Facebook that show that the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140
regards to Facebook that show that the
 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.840
regards to Facebook that show that the
more time that you spend on Facebook the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850
more time that you spend on Facebook the
 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.940
more time that you spend on Facebook the
more depressed you are and that it looks

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950
more depressed you are and that it looks
 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.679
more depressed you are and that it looks
like it's a causal relationship rather

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689
like it's a causal relationship rather
 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480
like it's a causal relationship rather
than just a correlational relationship

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
than just a correlational relationship
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.340
than just a correlational relationship
and it seems to have something to do

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350
and it seems to have something to do
 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.499
and it seems to have something to do
with the fact that Facebook is one of

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509
with the fact that Facebook is one of
 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090
with the fact that Facebook is one of
those platforms where everybody puts up

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100
those platforms where everybody puts up
 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890
those platforms where everybody puts up
an advertisement for their life right

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900
an advertisement for their life right
 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690

you think well that's a kind of
deception but by the same token you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880
deception but by the same token you
 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.399

facade of normality in in in you know

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420
facade of normality in in in you know
 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840
facade of normality in in in you know
just casual day-to-day interactions and

matter I mean so I don't think that's
 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.790
matter I mean so I don't think that's
necessarily

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800
necessarily
 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.890
necessarily
deception but the mass consequence of

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
deception but the mass consequence of
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.760
deception but the mass consequence of
that is something that we don't

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770
that is something that we don't
 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.570
that is something that we don't
understand at all and so well so with

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580
understand at all and so well so with
 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.980
understand at all and so well so with
that sort of introduction I'm going to

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990

with social media and let's say the old

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060
with social media and let's say the old
 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.480
with social media and let's say the old
media for lack of a better word and I'll

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
media for lack of a better word and I'll
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.190
