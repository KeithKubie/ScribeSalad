i would say that a 21st century search

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310
i would say that a 21st century search
 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.919
i would say that a 21st century search
system doesn't look like a search system

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929
system doesn't look like a search system
 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.860
system doesn't look like a search system
at all i think the most interesting part

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870
at all i think the most interesting part
 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.390
at all i think the most interesting part
about where searches headed is that it

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400
about where searches headed is that it
 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.160
about where searches headed is that it
will become more ambient more

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170
will become more ambient more
 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.240
will become more ambient more
transparent I think in even Tim I don't

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250

the future this notion of saying I'm

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820
the future this notion of saying I'm
 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.250
the future this notion of saying I'm
going to go search for that I'm going to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
going to go search for that I'm going to
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.080
going to go search for that I'm going to
go search that i'm going to go google

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090
go search that i'm going to go google
 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.300

old services and get online you had to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
old services and get online you had to
 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.799
old services and get online you had to
stop stop your train of thought

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809
stop stop your train of thought

interrupt your task and do that and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460
interrupt your task and do that and
 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.819
interrupt your task and do that and
search is kind of the same way today

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829

over the last 15 years the ability for

boosted dramatically meaning that search

boosted dramatically meaning that search
now has the ability to process the world

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500
now has the ability to process the world
 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740
now has the ability to process the world
not just index but make sense of all

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750
not just index but make sense of all

not just index but make sense of all
these things make sense of who I am make

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030
these things make sense of who I am make

so it's really exciting for nerds like

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
so it's really exciting for nerds like
 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.320
so it's really exciting for nerds like
me because suddenly we're not just

there we're finding patterns refining

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240
there we're finding patterns refining
 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.600
there we're finding patterns refining
insights we're finding things that no

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610
insights we're finding things that no
 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.030
insights we're finding things that no
one even knew using all this

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040
one even knew using all this
 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.220
one even knew using all this
computational power that we have so the

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230
computational power that we have so the
 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.960
computational power that we have so the
fact that you know heading down if I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
fact that you know heading down if I
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.200
fact that you know heading down if I
have to go up to midtown today avoiding

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210
have to go up to midtown today avoiding
 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.460
have to go up to midtown today avoiding
a certain street because there's

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470
a certain street because there's
 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.170
a certain street because there's
congestion that's a very simple example

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180
congestion that's a very simple example
 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.120
congestion that's a very simple example
of what search has search has looked at

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130
of what search has search has looked at
 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.500
of what search has search has looked at
all the data coming in from all the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510
all the data coming in from all the
 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.270
all the data coming in from all the
different cars and the street lights and

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280
different cars and the street lights and
 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.040
different cars and the street lights and
the cameras and whatnot and said there's

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050
the cameras and whatnot and said there's
 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.900
the cameras and whatnot and said there's
something happening here on on

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910
something happening here on on
 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.490
something happening here on on
thirty-eighth right so you should route

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500
thirty-eighth right so you should route
 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.040
thirty-eighth right so you should route
around that thing that isn't indexed

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
around that thing that isn't indexed
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.900
around that thing that isn't indexed
anywhere that is a that is a synthetic

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910
anywhere that is a that is a synthetic
 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.990
anywhere that is a that is a synthetic
creation of search so I think that's the

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000
creation of search so I think that's the
 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580
creation of search so I think that's the
second second really exciting thing the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590
second second really exciting thing the
 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:02.690
second second really exciting thing the
first one being in that kind of

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700
first one being in that kind of
 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.090
first one being in that kind of
transparency of it a second thing being

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100
transparency of it a second thing being
 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.400
transparency of it a second thing being
this predictive power and this creation

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410
this predictive power and this creation
 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.590
this predictive power and this creation
ability of it the last thing really I'm

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:09.600
ability of it the last thing really I'm
 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.570
ability of it the last thing really I'm
most excited about is the ability that

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580
most excited about is the ability that
 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.910
most excited about is the ability that
will have to interact with it in new and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920
will have to interact with it in new and
 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.120
will have to interact with it in new and
different ways and so in the same way

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130
different ways and so in the same way
 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.640
different ways and so in the same way
that is becoming more transparent search

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
that is becoming more transparent search
 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.780
that is becoming more transparent search
will be able to again be ambient around

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790
will be able to again be ambient around
 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.510
will be able to again be ambient around
us and it will be something where you're
