This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Audible.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.710
Feeling uncreative?

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.020
Just take a walk!

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.890
But first, watch this video.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:16.560
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - with yet another
reason to get up off your butt and move.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.250
If you're like me, you probably spend several
hours a day in front of a computer - and every

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.990
so often, you need a jolt of creative inspiration.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.530
Well, a new study from Stanford University
shows that walking - might be the best way

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.530
to go about that.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:34.110
The study looked at 176 college students,
who were engaged in some kind of creative

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.640
exercise, while either sitting or walking.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.530
They divided them into 4 groups, so half were
inside - either sitting, or walking on a treadmill

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.460
- and the other half were outside, either
walking or being pushed on a wheelchair to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.120
simulate the visual sensation of walking.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.620
They found that regardless of whether the
person was inside or outside - the simple

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.430
act of walking, significantly boosted their
creativity.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.880
And that creativity continued, even after
the person sat down.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.199
Perhaps more surprising, is that the people
inside walking on the treadmill, were facing

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.780
a completely blank wall, with no stimulation
whatsoever.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.810
And they STILL produced twice as many creative
responses than people who were sitting, outside

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.920
or inside.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.000
So walking induces creativity.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.360
That is the take-home message of this study.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560
But what effect does it have on other kinds
of thought processes?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.229
Well, to test that - they repeated the same
experiments, but instead of a creative exercise,

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.560
they had people do word association tasks,
which have a single correct answer, and require

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.000
much more focused levels of thinking.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.729
Surprisingly, the people who were walking
- actually performed worse on those exercises,

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.890
than the people who were sitting.

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.729
So if you need a creative boost - take a walk.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.600
But if you're looking for the answer to a
specific problem - sitting might be the way

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
to go.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.369
If you're looking for even more ways to improve
your mind, remember you can read AND walk

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.729
