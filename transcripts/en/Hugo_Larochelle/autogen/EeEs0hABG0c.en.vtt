00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 in this capsule we will approach the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.060
 problem of implementing mechanisms 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.110
 reference for reasoning 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.240
 probabilistic with Bezier networks 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.670
 so the main use and networks 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.949
 beziers it's basically calculating 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.640
 posterior probabilities being 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.270
 gave new observations to our 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 disposition 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.310
 so by just doing event reminds 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.580
 that an event launches too much if it's a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.309
 assignment of value to some of 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.190
 random variables associate my 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.320
 observations so for example I 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.899
 could question me considering the 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.030
 result of a battery weighs done for 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.280
 a patient is what now the 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.840
 likelihood that the patient in question 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.410
 certain diseases associated with 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.750
 random variable x so in what 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.280
 follows I'll talk a little bit about comment 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.100
 what we do this type of calculation has 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.989
 commented what implements them and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.539
 in swimming I will use I 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.770
 will be noted x the set of variables 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.309
 random ones for which I'm doing a 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.979
 racket 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.299
 so I speak in all in this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.070
 that if it will not necessarily be a 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.200
 only variable to you random variable 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.220
 it could be several 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.280
 but I will still use just 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.440
 the letter x 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.049
 ex could either be a set where a 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.200
 single random variable so in my 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.080
 example of now and that it would be is 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:28.729
 what my patient's diseases 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.930
 of interest that interests me or not that 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.860
 will be launched at the start and towards the east 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.119
 at war who are being watched and small them that 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.270
 is going to be the values ​​that are done 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.600
 observe so illegal 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:46.970
 small it would be the fact that the test and 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.729
 got the small result that it would be 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.369
 watching this and I could 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.240
 have several random variables that 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.590
 will belong to my ensemble and know how to be 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.539
 all the other variables that we are going 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.920
 to say hidden hidden in this way we 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.149
 not observe we're going to have to 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.819
 marginalize and so that could be 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:10.880
 among others variables yx on 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:12.730
 hate bodies that have not been done so 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.470
 for which we do not have the results 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.810
 then a query because we can go 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.540
 a request if we have 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.970
 the inference of so the calculation of the 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.200
 probability of variables of interest x 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:31.329
 given an observation for the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.329
 random variables observed big a 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:40.180
 good example of a rocket in our 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.180
 example or with burglary was 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.549
 alarmed I'm losing my husband at it not 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.790
 reason I could say if I observe that 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:52.310
 jean called me and that husband called me 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.540
 are both free I could 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.250
 ask me what is the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.680
 probability that is well and truly 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.329
 burglary at home to undertake 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.430
 the decision to what I call the police 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.799
 then I go to my home or not in 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.200
 this case if we did the math on 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.799
 would observe that we started from scratch 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.840
 point 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.880
 this is what is really a 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.560
 burglary at home so if we did 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.709
 the calculation from the probabilities 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.470
 we have fixed here 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.510
 the institute is so the question this is 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.519
 how are we doing this calculation 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.959
 so we saw how to do it by hand 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.910
 but how do we implement rey 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.400
 himself 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.490
 vehicle there we will have two approaches 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.750
 there are two different types what we 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.150
 could do some calculations of 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.450
 posterior probabilities like that one 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.220
 can make a difference that is accurate 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.230
 the advantage that we have an exact answer the 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.330
 disadvantage is that she hears from 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.490
 calculation sometimes it can be prohibitive 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.680
 it may require calculation times 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.120
 who are too high too tall is this 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.100
 what we will do is the method by 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.930
 enumeration that corresponds 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.160
 basically to what we've seen up 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.510
 now so I'm going to give a little 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.410
 more details about commenting what we 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.170
 could implement this at a high level 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.850
 and we will see rather a title of 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.920
 approach that is going to be inference 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:09.130
 approximate so when it's having 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.800
 a rough estimate of 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.750
 probabilities of inference and to see 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.209
 specifically a technique based on 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.770
 sampling and method in 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.280
 question we will see is what we 

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:26.080
 calls the rejection method so the 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.180
 exact method that could be used 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.730
 which takes the simplest is the 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.860
 inference method by enumeration 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.170
 basically corresponds to what we have 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.140
 done when doing calculations 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:39.550
 in the previous slides the for 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.130
 hand calculations for the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.810
 conditional probabilities 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.430
 so if we are interested in referring 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.470
 Variable distribution 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.390
 of interest x in relation to 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:53.200
 observations we know that this is the 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.580
 probability joins x and e normalized 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.440
 so divided by a constant of 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.160
 alpha normalization which corresponds in 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:05.169
 makes the probability that the variables 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.820
 observed be equal to what I observe and 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.910
 seven projectiles made it his flap 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.950
 calculate one must marginalized paranoid 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.750
 unobserved variable y 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:17.050
 ok so the calculus gilles auger business 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:18.580
 in fact if this calculation is here and I have 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.930
 do it for all values 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.640
 possible of x because I want the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.470
 complete distribution for all 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.860
 possible values ​​of a variable but 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.320
 of interest x also we know that these 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.580
 terms their in a Bézian network that 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.020
 can describe as a product of 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.420
 conditional policy that are 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.990
 extracted from the Bézian network 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:38.670
 we go if we have n a random variable in 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.980
 my bedding network that will match 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:45.750
 make the product of hate probability 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:50.010
 different and so that's so if we 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.740
 wants to calculate a value a probability 

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:57.480
 like that well one way to do it is a 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:59.700
 film simply to calculate the sums 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.310
 conditional policy products 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.100
 so I'm going to nap a sum 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.450
 on what 20 on everything so the values 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:16.590
 possible to 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:18.810
 so if if I have if I have that name here 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:21.120
 two variables y so moment y over one year 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.820
 without a bad year this is the size of 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.850
 together and that each of the variables to 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:29.960
 an area of ​​authority that means that 

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:33.720
 I have sums on the size of y 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.490
 elements and so that's it and in this case 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.980
 here I have to make the product of all 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.430
 conditional probabilities and the 

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.530
 number of policies conditional on 

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:46.010
 multiply if I calculated this 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.270
 joint probability the savate to be n 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.760
 is now I have to do this calculation 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.770
 for all possible values ​​of x 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.360
 to obtain among others my constant 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:58.020
 standardization can get all my 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.050
 distribution and the number of so the 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:04.770
 number of possible mistakes to fix these 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:06.750
 six deaths the earth of the domain of x this 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:09.630
 would be allah number of variables in 

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:11.660
 x and so if I had to do this calculation 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.430
 like that by listing all the 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.290
 possible assignments dy is all the 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.030
 possible assignments of x and then in 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.720
 doing produces hatred probabilities 

00:07:18.030 --> 00:07:21.750
 conditional 

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:24.870
 I will keep complexity in the worst 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:28.850
 high codes once halls to 

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:31.590
 ex sizes later on from there 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:33.120
 many say the earth is 

00:07:31.590 --> 00:07:34.880
 all areas of the largest domain 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.360
 so in the random dream code 

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:41.250
 binaisse of would be equal to 2 or even 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.370
 marc in fact that unfortunately we have 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:45.920
 something that is actually 

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:50.000
 exponential in the domain head 

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.660
 uh no sorry that is exponential 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.050
 in the number of variables relative 

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:59.780
 to which we must make enumerations to 

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:02.660
 know livable x then the variables 

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:04.730
 that we do not observe it given that 

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:05.900
 practice often we observed there are 

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:08.980
 many of the variables that are not observed 

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:11.360
 it can not be catastrophic 

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:14.090
 and that's why we say that 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.740
 the exact inference based on a reference 

00:08:14.090 --> 00:08:17.960
 by numeration it is often a 

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.850
 difference that we will want to invite 

00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:22.220
 site to avoid it's not really a 

00:08:19.850 --> 00:08:25.370
 an approach that in some 

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:27.080
 applications will be usable at 

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:29.420
 mark that complexity in space and 

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.220
 from broadband to standard variables 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:34.850
 of a terrible why because we have to 

00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:37.940
 remember all the values 

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:39.950
 possible of great peace exaggerates a 

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.010
 certain value given 1 then the 

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:45.230
 number of destinations exceeded at the 

00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:48.830
 number of variables in my set 

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:50.600
 x I will add that it's still 

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.030
 possible to make an approach a little 

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.020
 less naive than the one I just 

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:58.370
 describe where we would get complexity 

00:08:56.020 --> 00:09:00.170
 that would not depend on hate 

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:03.590
 here that would simply be from above the 

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:05.180
 at the size of explodes tijd and y 

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.770
 I invite you to look at the book 

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.600
 are energetic to know 

00:09:06.770 --> 00:09:11.210
 how may end teaching this is a 

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:14.120
 approach that will try to exploit the 

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.830
 do we have some certain 

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.330
 products that can be 

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.330
 updated within the sums 

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:25.640
 so you send an example so 

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.990
 imagine that we want to calculate this 

00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.540
 conditional policy when 

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:32.660
 burglaries compared to legal yapping 

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:35.630
 true husband calls would equal so I want 

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:38.300
 rated shorter way and 6 to change 

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:41.780
 and curvy and mega lift the variables 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:45.050
 hidden in this case if these earthquakes and 

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:46.880
 alarms and in what I have to calculate 

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:49.880
 this is the next thing are sure if 

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:53.000
 these alarms from the evidence of joigny on 

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.810
 all the variables / a constant of 

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.250
 normalization so a naive approach to 

00:09:56.810 --> 00:10:02.400
 the implement 

00:09:58.250 --> 00:10:04.290
 would consist in enumerating 

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.600
 all the values ​​of hesse and from to 

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.720
 then for each of the possible values 

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:13.680
 a burglary so for the box 

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:17.010
 is the co here was just onfray the sum 

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.590
 of probability joined on all 

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:24.180
 variables that breaks down a product of 

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:27.990
 peace of cp 2 sp2 gold knowing csp of j 

00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:30.240
 knowing how to help m knowing to do so 

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:32.370
 all these products there for all 

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:34.200
 possible values ​​of earthquakes and 

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:36.420
 tears I will do it first for 

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:38.390
 burglary equals true I will do it in 

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.430
 second for burglary equal must 

00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:44.700
 so that would give me the two values ​​of 

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:46.680
 numerator here and here he putting for 

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.270
 have my normalization constant but 

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:50.370
 I will just sum up my two 

00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:53.210
 numerator elements what would I give 

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:57.480
 my calculation of the complete distribution 

00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:59.550
 robbery I spoke earlier who who has 

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.740
 a way to have a variant a little 

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:03.240
 little more effective is actually this 

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:05.250
 variant when it will exploit it is 

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:07.440
 the fact that for example here I have not 

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:09.570
 always need for all 

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.020
 site values ​​has always multiplied 

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:14.940
 these five products such in fact I can 

00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.440
 bring in some of the sums and push a 

00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.150
 little more to the right to have multiplied 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.040
 minus two digits in his father's and 

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:23.280
 use some calculations so between 

00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:28.470
 others the sum on to play to insert 

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:31.830
 here instead the sum on is this so 

00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:35.310
 the sum on his game to insert it here to 

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:36.750
 the place so since from here I 

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:40.500
 terms that depend on aces then 

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:42.150
 if I have terms that depend on 

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:45.340
 once again in the era of details 

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:47.560
 on it I invite you to consult the 

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.780
 but so a very simple approach this 

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.310
 would simply list all the 

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.870
 possible values ​​of the variables 

00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:55.510
 of interest explain variables 

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.890
 hidden there for each of these 

00:11:55.510 --> 00:11:59.230
 combinations calculate it the 

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:03.340
 probabilities attached is a 

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:05.470
 sure product of hate or so the number 

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.520
 of variables in this case 5 so who 

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:10.030
 produce 5 probabilities 

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:13.590
 conditional and therefore to make the 

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:13.590
 are associated then the standardization 

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:22.000
 I think of one quickly that there is a 

00:12:17.470 --> 00:12:24.970
 approach that's as accurate but who 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.350
 allows to get some in the network code 

00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:30.880
 beziers with a structure for example 

00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:33.460
 of extraordinary structure a structure 

00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.650
 which allows certain accelerations 

00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:38.020
 so there is an algorithm called 

00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:39.910
 the lyre difference by elimination of 

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:44.260
 variables that allows you to get times 

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:49.290
 of calculation that are more appreciable 

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:51.880
 more convenient in an application 

00:12:49.290 --> 00:12:54.700
 the general idea is again 

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:56.950
 to try to reuse some of the 

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:59.230
 calculations so if we calculated for example 

00:12:56.950 --> 00:13:00.550
 this product here here good brands in 

00:12:59.230 --> 00:13:02.740
 all sums and products that must be 

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:06.640
 do this calculation there he also does 

00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:08.800
 in another place of our calculation 

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.690
 compounds and the idea here is 

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.580
 to use a kind of programming 

00:13:10.690 --> 00:13:14.080
 dynamics to store his calculations 

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:17.860
 intermedia there to make them one 

00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.660
 times so I invite you to crossroads 

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.360
 consult books specifically the 

00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.070
 section 14 points 4 points 2 in the 

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.580
 book energetically to have more 

00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:27.150
 details 

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.150
 on it 

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.450
 now we are going to look at the code 

00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:34.920
 the approximate inference so one the 

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:35.910
 shoulders it is they basically 

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:38.070
 all the different methods 

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:39.770
 abuses in the general case 

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.420
 complete appetite so we'll talk about 

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:45.530
 improvements still interesting 

00:13:42.420 --> 00:13:47.250
 for example with the algorithm 

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:49.860
 of variable elimination but when 

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:52.440
 even in the general case this is the 

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.790
 ference example your life complete what 

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.280
 does that instead in some 

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.590
 applications your must use a 

00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:01.310
 rather rough approach makes a 

00:13:58.590 --> 00:14:03.540
 more practical approach 

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:04.980
 the idea here the reason why one 

00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.630
 may be satisfied with a 

00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:09.390
 approximate reference is that between 

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:11.160
 others sometimes finally we need a 

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:13.080
 calculation that just needs to be 

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.970
 approximate that there is no need 

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.590
 to be exact to be able 

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:19.440
 to use our Bézian network 

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:21.960
 properly his interest are not having 

00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:23.280
 exactly the probabilities on the 

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.320
 variables of interest but just to know 

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:27.960
 for example what is the value of 

00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:30.810
 interest rates so the value small hic 

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.910
 what is such that the probability that 

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.500
 x be small and be the most 

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.840
 high given some 

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:38.570
 comments 

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.000
 so if I'm just interested in having the 

00:14:38.570 --> 00:14:43.560
 this value there that the value of 

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.820
 enjoy the highest I may have 

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:47.010
 no need to have probabilities 

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.540
 exact an approximate probability has 

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.310
 maybe I'll be able to find 

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:52.740
 carmen the right solution 

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:55.010
 the real value of memorable of interest 

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:58.950
 who have the highest probability 

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.750
 so we're going to focus on 

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:04.080
 techniques based on a technique in 

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:05.400
 done based on sampling so 

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:07.470
 what we are going to do is we are going to 

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.780
 assign values ​​to variables 

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:12.030
 random from the piles of politics 

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:14.070
 conditional he'll do so 

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:17.490
 these associates essentially a 

00:15:14.070 --> 00:15:19.110
 simulation of our gold Béziers network 

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:20.010
 actually offered several simulations 

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:21.600
 stochastic 

00:15:20.010 --> 00:15:25.860
 then from the results of these 

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:27.270
 simulations there we're actually going to used 

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:30.100
 these simulations there to make a 

00:15:27.270 --> 00:15:35.350
 estimate of 

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:36.339
 but probability of inference then the 

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:38.110
 method that we will see 

00:15:36.339 --> 00:15:40.600
 more specifically it is the method 

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:44.050
 called jackson sampling or the 

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.259
 rejection method so the idea as I 

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:49.360
 said it's to use simulations 

00:15:46.259 --> 00:15:51.850
 or in fact in our simulations we will 

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:53.050
 generate a complete observation of 

00:15:51.850 --> 00:15:55.959
 all the variables in my network 

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:59.230
 vézien and then to estimate the 

00:15:55.959 --> 00:16:00.600
 probabilities of inference but we're going 

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:02.769
 just use the fees like 

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.980
 standardized so the relative frequencies 

00:16:02.769 --> 00:16:07.990
 from then so estimated from the 

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.440
 observations that I have shipyard that I have 

00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.560
 simulated 

00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.810
 so we know that the probability of a 

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:16.329
 certain assignment ex equals 

00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:17.920
 exciting observation data its 

00:16:16.329 --> 00:16:19.870
 correspondence is here so I take 

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:22.480
 marginal practices are the 

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:25.569
 variables y possible then I normalize 

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:28.620
 by a normalization constant the 

00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:30.819
 the idea is that we will approximate its share 

00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:34.529
 standardized frequencies that is to say 

00:16:30.819 --> 00:16:38.670
 what do I imagine that I have generate several 

00:16:34.529 --> 00:16:42.939
 observations so many values ​​2x 

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:46.660
 and even there is so I will have a list 

00:16:42.939 --> 00:16:50.050
 of observation like that of simulation and 

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:52.120
 the from these pseudo unfortunately gives it 

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.579
 was giving there that I would have simulate and well 

00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:57.009
 I will esteem the policy expresses a 

00:16:54.579 --> 00:16:59.009
 some small value x being given 

00:16:57.009 --> 00:17:02.769
 some values ​​of the variables 

00:16:59.009 --> 00:17:04.569
 of observation them as being the number 

00:17:02.769 --> 00:17:07.419
 many times in my simulations 

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:09.730
 I observe this value of x there and this 

00:17:07.419 --> 00:17:14.500
 value of 1 for the variables 

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:17.309
 random which excelled in 1 / the sum 

00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:21.280
 frequencies for any value expressed 

00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:23.250
 and therefore frequency the sum of 

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.600
 high frequencies expressed values ​​and 

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:29.559
 so in other words actually it's going to be 

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:31.929
 the frequency of so the number of times 

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:34.590
 that I saw little x is small 

00:17:31.929 --> 00:17:36.570
 / the frequency not once I saw 

00:17:34.590 --> 00:17:39.090
 the variables 

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:43.490
 the rights associated with observations 

00:17:39.090 --> 00:17:46.649
 big e equal to small ok so 

00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:49.409
 intuitively the idea is that that in 

00:17:46.649 --> 00:17:51.240
 the bottom is that tells us if I did 

00:17:49.409 --> 00:17:53.009
 several simulations no but ends 

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.309
 final simulations what is the 

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:58.440
 proportion of times I observe that 

00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:01.559
 observed variables are equal to 1 on 

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:04.500
 the propensity of times where x vote equal to 

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:05.639
 little x but rather than make it a name 

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.860
 but finished twice I'll do it a 

00:18:05.639 --> 00:18:09.779
 man finished twice then I'm going 

00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:13.529
 use these frequencies their relative 

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:17.929
 so normalized as my estimates 

00:18:13.529 --> 00:18:19.919
 own reality of posters ya of inference 

00:18:17.929 --> 00:18:22.919
 so this technique of the asaples and 

00:18:19.919 --> 00:18:24.629
 rejection technique it's a technique 

00:18:22.919 --> 00:18:25.139
 of rejection to the extent that in my 

00:18:24.629 --> 00:18:28.590
 calculation 

00:18:25.139 --> 00:18:31.950
 here I will only be interested in 

00:18:28.590 --> 00:18:33.809
 simulations or a subset 

00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:38.429
 I am interested in the north under sets of 

00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:41.009
 simulation or but variables that are 

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:42.570
 observed they are going to be exactly equal 

00:18:41.009 --> 00:18:46.649
 at the observed value 

00:18:42.570 --> 00:18:47.940
 so if I have other simulations where the 

00:18:46.649 --> 00:18:49.610
 variables that belong to my 

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:52.950
 together they took other values 

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:54.809
 that does not fit little one but these 

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.549
 simulations are very much 

00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:59.879
 throw would not be considered in my 

00:18:56.549 --> 00:19:00.960
 calculation is the problem with that is that 

00:18:59.879 --> 00:19:06.870
 it's a method that does not go very well 

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:08.940
 market if the event grand e equal equals 

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.679
 small 1,6 and events there he will pray 

00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:13.470
 that is, there are very few friends 

00:19:10.679 --> 00:19:16.500
 simulation that are such that the 

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:19.769
 variables the random variables 

00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:22.879
 belonging to a big e are equal 

00:19:19.769 --> 00:19:25.830
 exactly at my observed values 

00:19:22.879 --> 00:19:28.440
 this is very few champions the 

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:30.090
 frequencies here are going to be very low and 

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.580
 there are other methods that are more 

00:19:30.090 --> 00:19:34.860
 effective that requires less 

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.019
 of samples ie if I have 

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.460
 my event question error that is not going 

00:19:37.019 --> 00:19:39.779
 need I have is champion is 

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.549
 really a very large number 

00:19:39.779 --> 00:19:45.269
 of observations to have an estimate 

00:19:41.549 --> 00:19:46.590
 which is close to reality and we do not 

00:19:45.269 --> 00:19:47.940
 would not speak in this capsule team and 

00:19:46.590 --> 00:19:52.039
 I invite you to consult the section 

00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.039
 14.5 of the book to learn more 

00:19:52.399 --> 00:19:58.649
 so here is an example of the use 

00:19:54.870 --> 00:20:00.179
 of the method grid by rhji based 

00:19:58.649 --> 00:20:01.590
 on sampling so let's imagine 

00:20:00.179 --> 00:20:03.899
 we want to estimate what is the 

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:07.980
 probability that my random variable 

00:20:03.899 --> 00:20:10.169
 this way to the real one since the 

00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.809
 laboratory m be equal to true so 

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:15.950
 it's in a new Bezier network that 

00:20:12.809 --> 00:20:18.870
 is this structure different so if 

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:20.039
 gfcm who do not have any ghk parents 

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:22.260
 actually compares m 

00:20:20.039 --> 00:20:26.639
 geo that there are no parents either 

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:28.620
 but I was like parra o and h and so 

00:20:26.639 --> 00:20:30.809
 in this case also to estimate this 

00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.480
 probability when I'm going to do that 

00:20:30.809 --> 00:20:35.970
 I will sampled from my network 

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:39.179
 beziers several observations I'm going 

00:20:35.970 --> 00:20:45.029
 assign green values ​​to fh 

00:20:39.179 --> 00:20:47.250
 oh and tea is in excess say I 

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:52.470
 lack it's just the samples 

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:55.710
 where m is equal to true hockey why 

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:56.820
 because it's only these colloquia 

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.559
 who put I'm interested in the 

00:20:56.820 --> 00:21:01.919
 likelihood that you're gala true for 

00:20:58.559 --> 00:21:04.080
 the cases where m is equal to bhl is so the 

00:21:01.919 --> 00:21:06.210
 way to make his son and to go there 

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.580
 sequentially I start with generated 

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:11.700
 randomly a value of f 

00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:13.769
 from its probability a priori and has 

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.369
 given its value the champions priority 

00:21:13.769 --> 00:21:17.610
 h 

00:21:14.369 --> 00:21:19.340
 from there championship dams 

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:21.570
 for F 

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:24.330
 so on until generating 

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:25.679
 everything but necessary variable so we have 

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.799
 an example here of an execution a 

00:21:25.679 --> 00:21:31.710
 simulation or generate f is equal to must 

00:21:28.799 --> 00:21:34.080
 so I do that by doing simulation 

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:36.840
 imagine that the way to do that is 

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:39.059
 kim heger so I have a generator of 

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.379
 random numbers in 0 and a bath this 

00:21:39.059 --> 00:21:41.940
 that I do what generates a long 

00:21:40.379 --> 00:21:43.110
 marathon by deflecting and then I check 

00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:45.389
 is it smaller than the 

00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:48.230
 probability that my variable part 

00:21:45.389 --> 00:21:50.960
 random be equal 

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:53.430
 if it is the case of me to you I the 

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.840
 April sign otherwise I sign it wrong 

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.480
 in this case also for this simulation 

00:21:54.840 --> 00:22:00.270
 lodges and get a result that f is 

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.360
 equal in depth the rest of that generates a 

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:05.700
 value for the random web h from 

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:08.070
 a value of f 

00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:10.080
 the mm schedule in this case as 

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:13.380
 justice considers only the cases where m 

00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:16.770
 is equal to April when if I get a 

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:18.300
 value of real games without dionne to 

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.160
 from his parents there is no 

00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:24.480
 parents so because if I'm just doing 

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:27.210
 sampled for part 0.6 which 

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.460
 is the probability that or be equal to 

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:30.660
 free I was talking with a moratorium 

00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.360
 general 0 and 1 

00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.640
 for this simulation too I got 

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:39.000
 in the real parts of that I'm going 

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:42.720
 sampled simulate an assignment 

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:46.500
 worth to wear it from 

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.270
 ax and at the value I have 

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:50.429
 champion and previously know true 

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.500
 is true so in that if I 

00:22:50.429 --> 00:22:53.460
 would change a number between 0 and a 

00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.110
 random way 

00:22:53.460 --> 00:23:02.280
 can I appear with the 

00:22:55.110 --> 00:23:05.490
 probability of peace is equal to 1 by the 

00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:08.429
 desired pt galabru knowing that or is 

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:11.690
 true is bought true because if the 

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:15.030
 parity is equal to 1 so necessarily 

00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:18.540
 my operative and between is going to be more 

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:20.730
 little one so I sampled 

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:22.320
 price of which I continue like that where I 

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.710
 sung one of this variable to this 

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:27.540
 variable at this variable this variable 

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:31.970
 then I start again here we did 

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:35.520
 eight samples in all and to make 

00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:37.500
 the estimate of the probability that you 

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.210
 es be equal address knowing that m is 

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:42.690
 equal April I'm just going to watch 

00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:45.420
 what is the average of the cases where you 

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:51.929
 is equal to true we have that if I have six 

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:53.570
 times true here here here here here and here on 

00:23:51.929 --> 00:23:56.250
 eight bodies in total 

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:57.960
 which gives me an estimate of the 

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.450
 probability drive there is the real 

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.620
 knowing that I do not care about haven and 

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:02.750
 0.75 

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.570
 because if we calculated after 

00:24:02.750 --> 00:24:07.400
 answer we would get 0.71 so we see 

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:09.880
 that when if that gives an estimate 

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:17.420
 which is not too bad only with 

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:18.800
 a sample of 8 simulation and so 

00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:20.750
 that's it and I want to remember it's very 

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.110
 important here in this case also all 

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:27.800
 my simulations that I observe it was 

00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:30.080
 any case where m equals true so 

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.300
 I may have simulated others 

00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:34.309
 other cases so I'm sampling again 

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.400
 m every time I support m is 

00:24:34.309 --> 00:24:38.059
 equal to false when if I ignore the 

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.620
 simulation 

00:24:38.059 --> 00:24:47.330
 so I'm definitely not used in 

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:49.100
 my frequency calculation finally he 

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:50.540
 there are different types of polls 

00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.870
 of requests we can make a network 

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:54.830
 beziers we talk about rockets from 

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:57.350
 diagnostic 

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:58.490
 when you know the effects then when 

00:24:57.350 --> 00:25:00.770
 we look for causes 

00:24:58.490 --> 00:25:02.570
 so in what if for example if I 

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:04.700
 I was interested in the parity of 

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:07.340
 burglaries knowing that jean tigana 

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.990
 true that's a stylistic query 

00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:11.840
 diagnosis because I have guys there 

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:14.929
 I call the guys there dre it's in 

00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:17.660
 makes an effect then the cause of that is 

00:25:14.929 --> 00:25:19.340
 if the burglary or not we can 

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:21.530
 also calculate other types of 

00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:23.240
 take advantage of the prediction probabilities 

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.470
 so because if it's a train 

00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.850
 know the causes and I would have 

00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:30.559
 estimated the distribution on the effects 

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:31.429
 so in my specific example in this 

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:33.320
 would be the opposite case 

00:25:31.429 --> 00:25:34.880
 I wonder about the distribution of 

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:37.730
 people call it sings burglary is 

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:40.220
 equal to true obviously we can calculate 

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:43.550
 joint or marginal policies 

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:45.650
 and as we saw this an example of this 

00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.740
 would be produced and not conditional so 

00:25:45.650 --> 00:25:50.600
 we package be a subset 

00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:51.950
 variables for example on the 

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:53.330
 probability lady so I could 

00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:56.480
 I was interested in this case to know 

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:59.450
 what is the proportion of time when 

00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:02.110
 my alarm would sound for example in 

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:02.110
 a given year
