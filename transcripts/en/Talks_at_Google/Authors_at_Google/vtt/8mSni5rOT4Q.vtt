00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.972
[INTRO MUSIC]

00:00:07.395 --> 00:00:09.367
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:16.690
DR. VINCE VITALE:
The alternative

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.450
to fleeing from truth
is fighting for truth.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.690
I was walking around
Oxford a few months ago.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.770
And two guys walking
just ahead of me

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.580
were having a
spirited conversation

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.480
about how crazy they found
certain beliefs that they

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.560
disagreed with.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.290
And one turned to
the other and said,

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.300
maybe the only solution
would be to shame them out

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.590
of their beliefs.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.350
And then, the other guy turned,
and this is what he said.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.370
I wrote it down.

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.840
He said, "Yes, that's
what we should do.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.220
We should ridicule
them mercilessly

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.360
in the most insensitive
ways we can think of."

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.400
That's an exact quote.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.929
And then, they turned, and they
swiped their faculty cards,

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.220
and walked into the University
of Oxford of Theoretical

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.020
Physics building.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.800
These were probably scholars
at Oxford, a place that prides

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.110
itself on intellectual freedom.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.830
And the exchange of ideas and
merciless, insensitive ridicule

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.480
was the best that
they can come up

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.480
with for how we should
resolve disagreements.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.720
I found myself wondering
how many beliefs they

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.300
held in theoretical
physics that one day will

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.120
be considered ridiculous.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.340
How does someone
get to this point?

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.580
How does someone
get to the point

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:41.670
where merciless ridicule seems
like the best way forward?

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.960
I think it's because you come to
see truth as greater than love.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.750
If truth is greater than
love, then you fight.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.480
Then, the pursuit
of truth justifies

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.720
whatever means necessary,
whether the means of Oxford

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.110
academics or the
means of terrorists.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.610
The alternative is that
love is greater than truth.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.920
Then, you flee.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.150
You flee from the
dangers of truth,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.620
and accept every
belief, no matter

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.620
how incoherent because at least
that's better than starting

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.570
yourself on a trajectory
that, ultimately,

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.120
is going to lead to intolerance,
extremism, and violence.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.750
The truth gets sacrificed
at the altar of love,

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.070
or love gets sacrificed
at the altar of truth.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.740
Either truth is
greater than love,

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.240
or love is greater than truth.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.500
Fight or flee.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.860
This is the cultural ultimatum
that we're living in.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.800
What's your choice?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.630
And I don't think it's
getting any better.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:44.520
I had a graphic here
of a representation

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.360
of our increasing political
polarization in this country.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.980
And when you see the difference
between 1994 and 2004,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.190
it's very minimal in terms
of our political values.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.720
And then, when you
see the widening

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.120
of the gap between 2004
and 2014, it's huge.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.340
92% of Republicans are to the
right of the median Democrat.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.890
And 94% of Democrats are to the
left of the median Republican.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.540
We're not close enough
to talk to each other.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.420
And so, from that
distance, all you can do

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.840
is either ignore each other,
or shout at each other.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.680
Once again, fight or flee.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.000
What's your choice?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.080
Maybe there's another way.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.780
Hassan John was one of
my students last year.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:40.350
He's an Anglican minister
from northern Nigeria.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.110
And on the first day
of classes at lunch,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.680
one of his fellow classmates
said to him, Hassan,

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.090
how do you manage to minister
in a context in which you're

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.530
viewed as the enemy?

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.930
We knew that Hassan
was from a region that

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.030
was terrorized by Boko Haram.

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.360
We found out only later that
he had been shot at twice

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.540
and that there was a
bounty on his head.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.210
Hassan began to tell us a story
of how there came a point when

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.710
he had seen so many of
his brothers and sisters

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.380
murdered for their
faith that he started

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.164
a conversation with a known
gun dealer to acquire an AK47.

00:04:21.164 --> 00:04:25.497
And he thought violence
was the only answer.

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.330
When he was in his home
trying to figure out

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.540
where to get the money
to acquire this gun,

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.430
a young girl ran by the
front door of his home

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:35.270
during school hours.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.520
He stopped her, and he said,
why aren't you in school?

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.860
She said, my parents don't
have the money to pay.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.010
He said, that's not right.

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.800
My church and I would like
to pay for your school fees.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.230
Will you take me
to your parents?

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:50.860
And then, his stomach
knotted up as she walked him

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:54.640
across the clear dividing line
between the Christian section

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.620
of town and the Muslim
section of town.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.740
He had assumed that this girl
was from a Christian home.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:01.472
She was, in fact,
from a Muslim home.

00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:03.430
But he had committed to
paying her school fees,

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.300
and so Hassan and his church
began to pay her school fees.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.520
Then, he found out that
her brothers were also

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.660
not in school.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:13.300
Then, he met another Muslim
child who wasn't in school,

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.650
and another, and another.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.140
Today, there are
200 Muslim children

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.480
who are being educated
in church schools

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.550
by Hassan and his church.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.500
Then Hassan thought
to himself, why are we

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.940
only helping the children?

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.834
He realized that the
women in his community

00:05:27.834 --> 00:05:30.250
had a style of making clothes
that the Muslim women didn't

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.700
have.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.491
And the Muslim women
had a style of cooking

00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:34.630
that the Christian
women didn't have.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:37.600
And now there are 160
Christian and Muslim women

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.940
who get together, and
share their expertise,

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.030
and befriend each other,
and bless each other.

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.600
Just before Hassan
came to Oxford,

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.200
some militant youths who
are involved in terrorism

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.030
showed up at his front door.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.370
And he was scared.

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.660
He thought his
life was in danger.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.100
He thought his family's
life was in danger.

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:04.360
And they looked at him sternly,
and they said, why don't you

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.070
do anything for us?

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.420
You help the children.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.680
You help the women.

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.840
Why don't you do
anything for us?

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.050
Militant youth engaged
in terrorism are showing

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.050
[? up at the ?] [? door ?] of
an Anglican pastor asking him

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.470
to incorporate them into
his mission strategy.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.230
Absolutely unbelievable.

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:25.630
And here's my question.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:31.170
Why did those youth
respond so positively?

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.190
After all, Hassan was
disagreeing with them

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.960
in a big way.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:39.240
For starters, he was
saying that Jesus Christ

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.270
should be at the center
of their education.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.067
He was also clearly saying that
we should love our enemies,

00:06:45.067 --> 00:06:46.650
we should turn the
other cheek, and we

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.274
should pray for those
who persecute us,

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:51.690
things that would not have
been true in their world view.

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:53.560
But here's the thing.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.670
Hassan's disagreement
with them was not

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.940
greater than his love for them.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.450
His loving sacrifice for
them was the very content

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:05.310
of his disagreement with them.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:10.500
He cut the link between
disagreement and devaluing

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.550
of the person because his
communication of truth

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.860
was one and the same as
his communication of love.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.910
And that is the gospel.

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:25.930
That is the central
message of Christianity.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.330
Jesus disagreed with us.

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:31.930
His very coming was an act
of disagreement with us.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.230
A statement that we required
saving because our lives

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:39.760
disagreed so badly with what
He had intended for them.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:47.150
But Jesus' coming was also his
greatest act of love for us.

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:50.090
His willingness to
suffer alongside us.

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.120
His willingness to
join us in our shame.

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.540
His willingness to lay
down His life for us.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.350
The cross where Jesus died,
this symbol of Christianity.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.760
It's a symbol of the perfect
intersection of love and truth.

00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.950
Jesus's death is the
greatest expression

00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.050
of God's disagreement with us.

00:08:09.050 --> 00:08:12.680
And yet, simultaneously, it
is the greatest expression

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.150
of God's love for us.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:22.670
Truth and love perfectly
united in a personal sacrifice.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.830
Not truth is greater than love.

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.790
Not love is greater than truth.

00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:31.440
But God is love.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.840
And God is truth.

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.799
And therefore, truth is love.

00:08:37.799 --> 00:08:42.280
In Jesus, truth equals love.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:46.090
And therefore, I think
Jesus is uniquely positioned

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.880
to get us out of the cultural
ultimatum that we're stuck in.

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.940
Fight or flee.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:59.710
Authentic Christianity
rejects that ultimatum.

00:08:59.710 --> 00:09:02.720
It refuses to let
disagreement lead

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.000
to the devaluing of the other.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.690
It refuses to choose
between truth and love

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:11.490
because, according to Jesus,
and in the person of Jesus,

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:16.510
and in His sacrifice, truth
and love are one in the same.

00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:19.440
On one of his last
Sunday's with us in Oxford,

00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:22.900
our pastor interviewed Hassan.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:28.007
And his first question was, he
asked Hassan, is it worth it?

00:09:28.007 --> 00:09:30.340
And Hassan had this, sort of,
quizzical look on his face

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.770
because the answer
was so obvious to him.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.770
And he said, of course.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:36.990
And then, our
pastor asked Hassan

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:39.810
if he had any parting
words for us as a church.

00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.260
And he said that he did.

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.830
And then he said,
I beg you, do not

00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:48.280
compromise here in
the West on the faith

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.400
that we, in Africa,
are dying for.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.970
Do not compromise here
in the West on the faith

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.910
that we, in Africa,
are dying for.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:01.620
And I personally have
to keep reminding myself

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.670
that this is not
extraordinary Christianity.

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:08.670
This is just the simple
message of Jesus.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:12.060
Truth that is of love,
love that is truth.

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:16.140
Laying down your life in
order to communicate the truth

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:17.910
to others.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:20.900
Who are you laying
down your life for?

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:26.100
Every Christian needs to be
able to answer that question.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.810
How often is our disagreement
with others our very act

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.050
of giving our lives for them?

00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:37.050
What would that look
like in our context?

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.230
What would it look
like for us to disagree

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.260
with people with
such generosity,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.990
and such love, and
such personal sacrifice

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:47.970
that the people we're
disagreeing with

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.310
would show up on
our front doorstep,

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.940
as they did with Hassan,
asking for us to act

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.130
on our disagreement with them?

00:10:57.130 --> 00:11:01.450
Who do you disagree
with passionately?

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.700
Who's your enemy?

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:08.480
I wonder if someone just
jumped into your mind

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.180
as I asked those questions.

00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.290
Are you fighting them?

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:18.950
Are you fleeing from them?

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:23.830
Or are you making a
personal sacrifice for them?

00:11:23.830 --> 00:11:27.550
What would it look like
to communicate truth

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:33.340
to those we disagree with
through an act of radical love

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.710
and personal sacrifice?

00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:37.840
That is the question.

00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:39.850
I don't think that's
an easy question.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:43.420
But that is the question
that Hassan figured out

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:47.990
how to answer in his context.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:49.670
And I think we will
live in brokenness

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.310
until we can figure
out how to answer

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.490
that question in our context.

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:59.210
We're being told that we
live in a post truth society

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.490
that, truth is dead.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.100
I don't think that
truth is dead.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.080
But I do think that truth died.

00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:15.790
2000 years ago on a wooden
cross, the truth was stretched,

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.410
the truth was twisted,
and it was bent.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.700
The truth hurt, and
the truth was buried.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:32.180
Love and truth is at the central
message of the Christian faith.

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:37.850
Love and truth find their
unity and their power

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:41.290
in personal sacrifice.

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:47.530
And there's only one God who
has sacrificed himself for us.

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:51.140
And that's the God that
I commend to you today.

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.216
[INAUDIBLE] brief word
of prayer with me.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.280
God, I thank you that I can
come to you with such confidence

00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.770
that you are both
love and truth.

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:14.330
I thank you that when you
came and made a sacrifice

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:17.020
that you didn't have to make.

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.560
You told me the
truth about myself.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.220
You convinced me of
the evil in my heart

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.930
because people just
like me killed you.

00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.100
And yet, simultaneously,
you convinced me

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.470
of your love for me
because you showed me

00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:38.500
that there was nothing
that you wouldn't give,

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.220
even your very
life, that I might

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:44.260
be in friendship
and relationship

00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.530
with you for all eternity.

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:51.010
And God, if that vision
of love and truth

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:54.040
perfectly intersecting in
perfect unity that is true

00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:01.130
only in you, if there's anyone
in this room who doesn't know

00:14:01.130 --> 00:14:05.840
that possibility, who has
felt like they need to choose,

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:08.270
I pray that today
would be a day where

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:11.660
that vision of who you are,
perfect love and perfect truth,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.610
would settle deep
within our souls

00:14:13.610 --> 00:14:15.230
and would bring transformation.

00:14:15.230 --> 00:14:16.440
I trust you for that.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:17.610
In Jesus' name, amen.

00:14:25.035 --> 00:14:26.520
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.950
RAVI ZACHARIAS:
Thank you, Vince.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:36.510
When I stand up before
you, I feel a little bit

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:41.670
like a man who owned a
business on fortune telling

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:44.430
and had a few
hundred palm readers.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:47.010
And he would gather them all
together and said to them,

00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:49.590
I hate to give you
this news, but we're

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.890
going to have to let
about half of you go.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:55.380
He said, but then again, you all
probably knew that was coming.

00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:56.520
[LAUGHING]

00:14:56.520 --> 00:14:59.694
And so when I stand up in
front of a Google audience,

00:14:59.694 --> 00:15:01.110
I wonder if there's
anything I can

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:03.840
say that you don't already
know, that you've either

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.690
heard or read somewhere.

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.960
I mean, you're an
amazing group of people.

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.260
A company starting off with
a proper name that turns

00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:16.260
into a verb across the globe.

00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:20.340
I remember being picked
up in Delhi late one night

00:15:20.340 --> 00:15:22.290
by the hotel limousine.

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:25.620
And as he was driving
me, I was quite tired.

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:28.050
You know, when you land
after a day's journey,

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:29.610
you look like your
passport picture.

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:30.330
[LAUGHING]

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:33.520
And he was driving
me to the airport.

00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:38.510
And then, he told me how
many books I had written.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.790
I said, how do you know that?

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:43.680
He said, before I came,
I Googled your name, sir.

00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:44.360
[LAUGHING]

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.870
And so here's a limousine
driver quoting you

00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:51.140
guys thousands of
miles away using

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:53.630
a word that has now
become synonymous

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.910
with actionable intelligence.

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:58.940
So you are certainly
one of the prime movers

00:15:58.940 --> 00:16:01.850
of turning thought into action.

00:16:01.850 --> 00:16:05.240
But I will always remember
what I heard one speaker say.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:08.960
I cannot remember where it
was, but I heard him say it.

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.300
He said, you may
have a smartphone,

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.010
but that is no guarantee
that it is a wise phone.

00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:19.520
All kinds of access
to information

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:23.870
does not guarantee
how we ought to live.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:27.590
It only tells us
how we can live.

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:31.280
When you put capacity,
and possibility, and ideas

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:35.420
within reach, if you have
not trained the character

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.780
to use that capacity,
all you end up doing

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:44.540
is putting the reach for
some very, very heinous ends

00:16:44.540 --> 00:16:47.060
in the hands of a
person who does not

00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:50.660
know what to do with
that except to break it.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:56.730
That's a sobering
thought for you.

00:16:56.730 --> 00:17:00.110
It's a very sobering thought
for a person like me.

00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:03.670
Where do you go to find wisdom?

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:07.839
It was Aldous Huxley
writing in the '40s who

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:14.050
made the comment I want this
world not to have meaning.

00:17:14.050 --> 00:17:17.560
In his book "Ends and Means,"
"I want this world not

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:22.089
to have meaning, because a
meaningless world, said he,

00:17:22.089 --> 00:17:27.069
gives me the freedom to
my own sexual proclivities

00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:30.310
and my political ambitions."

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.020
A meaningless world
puts at my disposal

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.710
the possibility of
all that I want to do

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:40.920
without any moral boundaries.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.350
You know, it was Andrew
Fletcher, the 18th century

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:45.090
political activist
from Scotland,

00:17:45.090 --> 00:17:47.610
who said, let me write
the songs of a nation.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.480
I don't care who
writes its laws.

00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.130
Let me write the
songs of a nation.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:54.390
I don't care who
writes its laws,

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.570
because knowledge is
a deadly friend when

00:17:56.570 --> 00:17:59.200
no one sets the rules.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.170
And the rock group said, and
the fate of all mankind, I see,

00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:06.160
is in the hands of fools.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.985
Confusion will be my
epitaph as I crawl

00:18:08.985 --> 00:18:10.900
a cracked and broken path.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.780
If we make it, we can
all sit back and laugh.

00:18:13.780 --> 00:18:16.510
But I'm afraid tomorrow
I'll be crying.

00:18:16.510 --> 00:18:20.910
You see, once upon a time, you
had to go to places in order

00:18:20.910 --> 00:18:23.320
to become wrongheaded.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.340
Now those places come to
you and dangle on your hip,

00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.790
and have the capacity
to take young minds

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:35.020
and pervert them so
quickly and so soon

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.520
that I think you and I both have
an extraordinary responsibility

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.200
to this generation.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.470
How do we give them
what they can do?

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:49.690
And where do they go to find
out what they ought to do?

00:18:49.690 --> 00:18:52.740
Because true freedom is
really not the liberty

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.390
to do whatever we want but the
strength to do what we ought.

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.050
Think of it this way.

00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.710
Dr. Martin Luther King,
Jr., in the reception

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:06.310
of his Nobel Prize, made
an extraordinary speech.

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:09.220
And his closing line said this.

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:11.110
He started off by
saying, "I refuse

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:12.790
to believe that
man is mere flotsam

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:14.710
and jetsam in a river of life.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.870
I refuse to believe
that we are so bound

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:19.980
to the starless
of racism and war

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:22.840
that the bright daybreak
of peace and brotherhood

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:24.440
will not become a reality.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:25.780
I refuse all these things."

00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:27.640
And then he ended
by saying this.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.580
"I believe unarmed truth
and unconditional love

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.260
will have the final
word in reality."

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:33.220
Imagine that.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:36.580
I believe that unarmed
truth and unconditional love

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.130
will have the final
word in reality.

00:19:39.130 --> 00:19:45.660
Now, our entire educational
system is based on naturalism.

00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:51.250
The metaphysical extrapolations
of a materialistic world view.

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:53.230
But if unarmed truth
and unconditional love

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:55.930
will have to have the
final word in reality,

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:58.330
that does not come from
scientific imperatives.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:20:01.990
Those are philosophical, indeed
metaphysical, or, if you would,

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:04.910
spiritual latitudes.

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:07.970
An unarmed truth and
unconditional love

00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:09.950
will have the final
day in reality.

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:16.640
And if that doesn't, what you
end up is the young man being

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.170
put into a plane, and
shipped across 10,000 miles,

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:25.920
and comes home as a physical
zombie to be held in the arms

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.390
of his parents who are glad
just to be able to hold him,

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:34.610
even though he
cannot even respond.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:39.080
You're living in a world
of immense possibilities.

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.370
And men and women like you have
that incredible responsibility

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:46.100
of how you're going
to guide our young,

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.500
and how you're
going to determine

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.830
that truth and love will have
the final word in reality.

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:54.480
Otherwise, the victory
will be Pyrrhic,

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.770
where the vanquished has
gained more than the victor.

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.740
And so I bring to you this
question in a very simple way

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.270
within a few minutes.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:10.080
It all has to do with
this very basic question.

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.600
In our book, "Jesus
Among Secular Gods,"

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.560
we deal with humanism, and
existentialism, and naturalism,

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:18.720
and evolutionism,
and all of that.

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.360
And we give the
Christian alternatives.

00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:23.970
What is the alternative
that Jesus Christ really

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:24.960
gives to you and me?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.550
And I have to say this.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.860
I do not know of any
answers that anybody

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.720
gets that correspond more
to reality as we live it out

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.300
and put together a
coherent worldview

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:39.120
as the teachings of Jesus
did going back 2,000 years

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:40.380
and what he taught.

00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:42.540
And prior to that,
of course, building

00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:44.640
on the shoulders of the
prophets and all who

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.050
had spoken before him.

00:21:47.050 --> 00:21:48.510
And the question is this.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:52.780
What does it mean to be human?

00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.510
That's the question
from where we start.

00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:57.580
What does it mean to be human?

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:01.030
What is it that you
essentially represent?

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:04.240
Not what you
existentially may crave,

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.390
but what is it that you
essentially represent?

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:09.850
Who you are in your
innermost being.

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:12.130
In our search for
identity today,

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:15.640
which is a very real
search, if we do not

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.870
know who we are in our essence,
then the Chestertonian warning

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:22.510
is true that there are many,
many angles at which you

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:26.596
can fall, and only one angle at
which you can stand straight.

00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:29.930
And GK Chesterton went on to
say the tragedy of disbelieving

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:33.290
in God is not that a person
ends up believing in nothing.

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:34.790
Alas, it is much worse.

00:22:34.790 --> 00:22:39.130
That person may end up
believing in anything.

00:22:39.130 --> 00:22:42.460
A young student of
Harvard made this comment

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.330
to Kelly Monroe [? Kohlberg ?]
in a book, the "Finding God

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:46.930
at Harvard."

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:47.910
He said this.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.770
"I am allowed to
believe anything here,

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.540
so long as I don't
claim it to be true."

00:22:55.070 --> 00:22:58.490
That is ironic, because
the very motto of Harvard

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:04.790
is veritas, which means the
imperative for the reason

00:23:04.790 --> 00:23:07.730
for their existence,
something that you can never

00:23:07.730 --> 00:23:10.980
affirm in your life.

00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.660
How ironic.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.510
How contradictory
has life begun.

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:19.710
I want to give you four
very quick answers to this.

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:21.211
I've dealt with it
more extensively.

00:23:21.211 --> 00:23:23.085
And I believe in one of
the chapters of book,

00:23:23.085 --> 00:23:23.820
I deal with this.

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.350
And it is this.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.600
But let me go back this way.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.840
In the year 2000, the
former Soviet Union

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.220
released its
political prisoners.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.720
One of them is a man by the name
of Andreas Thomas, a Hungarian,

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.900
who had been incarcerated
by them for 55 years.

00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.434
Most of the time, in
solitary confinement.

00:23:42.434 --> 00:23:44.100
They believed he'd
gone insane, and they

00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:45.810
were going to do away with him.

00:23:45.810 --> 00:23:50.280
But Andreas Thomas showed
moments and flashes

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.000
of reality, which made
them think maybe he

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.250
was just medically ill.

00:23:56.250 --> 00:23:59.850
So a Hungarian psychiatrist
offered to come and treat him,

00:23:59.850 --> 00:24:00.420
and he did.

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:02.295
And as he walked away
from the room, he said,

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:04.170
he is not insane.

00:24:04.170 --> 00:24:07.210
You have driven him to the
point of near insanity.

00:24:07.210 --> 00:24:08.160
Give him back to us.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:09.605
We will make him well again.

00:24:09.605 --> 00:24:10.905
So he's put into a wheelchair.

00:24:10.905 --> 00:24:13.530
And Andreas Thomas
is being wheeled out.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.140
And as he's being wheeled out,
he makes his first request.

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:18.420
He was speaking an
old Hungarian dialect.

00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:20.110
He'd gone to prison
when he was 20.

00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.795
He was now 75.

00:24:23.309 --> 00:24:24.850
And he asked, made
his first request,

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.610
he wanted to see a mirror.

00:24:26.610 --> 00:24:30.060
He had not seen his
face in 55 years.

00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:34.519
So there you are the
vibrancy of youth and strong.

00:24:34.519 --> 00:24:36.060
And over half a
century later, you're

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.869
going to look at your
face for the first time.

00:24:38.869 --> 00:24:40.410
And as soon as he
looked at his face,

00:24:40.410 --> 00:24:43.140
he could barely stand it
for more than a moment.

00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.330
Turned the mirror down,
put his face in his hands,

00:24:45.330 --> 00:24:47.800
and sobbed uncontrollably.

00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.570
It destroyed him.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:51.130
It destroyed him.

00:24:51.130 --> 00:24:55.900
He had never remembered what
he had looked like, and longed

00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:59.620
for the day when he was
a mere 20 to see what he

00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.050
was in the prime of his youth.

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.090
Is there a mirror for the soul?

00:25:04.090 --> 00:25:06.610
Is there a mirror
for our essence?

00:25:06.610 --> 00:25:08.950
The bible says, yes, there is.

00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:10.690
And I give you
four quick answers.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:15.180
Number one, that we have a
creator, which means life

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.510
has a purpose.

00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:19.930
Every time you read
a book, you know

00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:21.700
there's an author to that book.

00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:22.930
There is a writer.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:24.130
There is an intent.

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:25.750
There is a storyline.

00:25:25.750 --> 00:25:31.240
And that creator has revealed
his plan for us and given to us

00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.350
two things.

00:25:32.350 --> 00:25:35.830
Intrinsic worth and
reflective splendor.

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:39.520
Intrinsic worth and
reflective splendor.

00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:42.190
How do we know what
that intrinsic worth is?

00:25:42.190 --> 00:25:44.200
There are two
amazing conversations

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:48.050
Jesus has in the gospel of
Mark in Mark chapter 12.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:51.880
The first one comes to him
and is trying to pit politics

00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.260
against politics.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:58.610
And he says to him, is it all
right to pay taxes to Caesar?

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.782
And how desperately we
wish Jesus had said no.

00:26:01.782 --> 00:26:03.198
[LAUGHING]

00:26:04.614 --> 00:26:06.485
But Jesus said, do
you have a coin?

00:26:06.485 --> 00:26:07.640
And the man said, yes.

00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:09.339
He said, give it to me.

00:26:09.339 --> 00:26:11.380
And he looked at the coin,
and looked at the man,

00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.390
And He said, whose image
do you see on this?

00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:15.760
And the man said, Caesar.

00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.220
Jesus said give to Caesar
that which belongs to Caesar,

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.140
and give to God that
which belongs to God.

00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:23.490
The man should have had
a follow-up question.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.250
The follow-up question should
have been, what belongs to God?

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:31.320
And Jesus would have said,
whose image is on you?

00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:39.770
You belong to God.

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.000
It's not surprising that
he refers to his body

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:43.680
as the temple--

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:48.000
as the temple of the living
God where you commune with him.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.500
It's a tent.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.680
It's not anything of
permanence, but it is a shelter.

00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.620
It is a place where
you have communion.

00:26:55.620 --> 00:27:00.610
No other world view gives you
that description of imago dei.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:01.960
You are not God.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.570
There is a Hindi song, which we
used to sing when I was young.

00:27:04.570 --> 00:27:10.140
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.940
I am not God, nor
am I the devil.

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:15.100
You can say what you will.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.940
I am a human being.

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:19.674
I'm a human being.

00:27:19.674 --> 00:27:20.340
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:20.960
I'm not God.

00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:21.640
[SPEAKING HINDI]

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.070
I'm not Satan.

00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:26.410
The world, you can
choose what you will.

00:27:26.410 --> 00:27:29.170
I have concluded I
am a human being.

00:27:29.170 --> 00:27:32.410
And Jesus states that to
the highest possible level,

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:33.680
you're not God.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.530
You're not human.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:37.300
But you are made
in the image of God

00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:43.270
to be self-determining and
have moral reasoning capacity.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:44.920
That's the difference.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.870
We have moral
reasoning capacity.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:51.730
That's what made America very
unique in the experimentation

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:53.020
of political theory.

00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:56.090
It was not reasoning alone,
which the French philosophes

00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:59.270
and the German philosophers
and all talked about reasoning,

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:02.860
and all the way from man is
the measure of all things,

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:07.090
going back to the Greek thinkers
and coming through Descartes

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.550
and so on, where just
because you doubt,

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.590
therefore you know
that you exist.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.370
Moral reasoning-- the
sense of is an oughtness--

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:19.110
is what drove the
American dream.

00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:22.110
Gertrude Himmelfarb, professor
of Columbia University,

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:23.910
in her book "The
Roads to Modernity"

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.570
has a whole chapter on
the evangelical awakening.

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:29.640
Of all people, a
philosopher like

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.330
that talking about the impact
of the Wesleyan meetings

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:36.630
to awaken England to the
moral reasoning capacity

00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:37.320
that we have.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.030
Intrinsic worth.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.480
And then, the second
conversation Jesus

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:46.080
has in the same chapter is
the man trying to set religion

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:48.030
against religion,
law against law,

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:50.980
not politics against religion.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.130
He says, what's the
greatest commandment?

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:57.280
See, Moses gives 613.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.720
Isaiah reduced them to 11.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.140
David to 15.

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:00.910
Micah to 3.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.640
Do justice, love mercy, and
walk humbly before your God.

00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:07.610
Jesus could have
reduced it to one.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:09.650
He didn't.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:11.900
He said, you know what the
greatest commandment is?

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:13.820
To love the Lord your God
with all your heart, and all

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.830
your soul, and all your
mind, and all your strength,

00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:17.510
and to love your
neighbor as yourself.

00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:19.340
He said, on these
two commandments

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.410
hang all of the laws
of the prophets.

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:23.660
Because of the first,
the second follows.

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.630
Without the first, the second is
with their feet firmly planted

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:27.145
in mid-air.

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:34.790
I cannot violate you because you
are made in the image of God.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:38.950
And out of all of the 613 laws,
my Lord reduced it to two.

00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:41.270
To love him, and to
love [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:45.170
I have no right to violate
you or, in any way,

00:29:45.170 --> 00:29:47.060
to dismember who you are.

00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.370
That's why we are
called individuals.

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:50.900
We are indivisible.

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:54.980
There is that composite
reality to your life and mine.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:57.600
Intrinsic worth and
reflective splendor.

00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.110
The reflective
splendor being this.

00:30:00.110 --> 00:30:03.980
That you have an
individual relationship

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:09.940
in this cosmic community.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:12.520
I was gone for about four
months through many countries.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.460
Got home last week, and
spent this last five, six

00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:16.570
days at home.

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:18.540
They were beautiful.

00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:20.970
To know that I was having
dinner with my wife every night,

00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.527
that's a huge blessing.

00:30:23.527 --> 00:30:25.860
And then, to know that the
grandkids could come and open

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.770
the door without even knocking.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:30.880
Nice to see you, Papa.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.220
We celebrated a birthday.

00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:34.720
When I get back on
Friday, I'll have

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:38.050
to go through a torturous
one-hour ballet recital of two

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:39.430
four-year-old grandkids.

00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:40.822
[LAUGHING]

00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.490
And they want to make sure
I'm coming back for that.

00:30:45.490 --> 00:30:50.170
You see, in this world of so
many people we love and know,

00:30:50.170 --> 00:30:53.650
there's a particularity
to relationships,

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:58.100
which defines who you and I are
in the microcosm of a family.

00:31:00.930 --> 00:31:02.910
My son went to Taylor
University, Indiana.

00:31:02.910 --> 00:31:06.000
In 2006, they had a
horrible accident there.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.070
And all of them were
smashed to death

00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:13.090
in a van coming home from a
weekend of doing some work.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.370
And as the funerals
were held, there

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:19.350
was only one gal
whose life was spared.

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:22.090
Her name was Laura Van Ryn.

00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:24.790
And so the Van Ryn family came
and stood by her bedside day

00:31:24.790 --> 00:31:26.110
after day, week after week.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:28.160
But as she began to
gain her composure,

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:32.570
her boyfriend said
something's not right.

00:31:32.570 --> 00:31:34.196
That's not Laura.

00:31:34.196 --> 00:31:36.070
They said, what do you
mean that's not Laura?

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:37.080
She's all mangled.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:37.890
She'll come to it.

00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.660
He said, no, that's not Laura.

00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:41.850
The answers are not
making any sense,

00:31:41.850 --> 00:31:45.170
but they seem to be
making sense to her.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:46.950
Finally, one day
she opened her eyes.

00:31:46.950 --> 00:31:50.700
And she said, why do you
all keep calling me Laura?

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:53.235
My name is Whitney.

00:31:53.235 --> 00:31:56.880
I'm not Laura.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:32:00.235
So the father, the Van
Ryn dad, gets on the phone

00:32:00.235 --> 00:32:01.110
and calls the office.

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:04.200
Was there a girl by the
name of Whitney in the van?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.910
Said, yes, there
was a Whitney Cerak.

00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.880
They said, we think we've
got Whitney in the bed here.

00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.430
That's not Laura.

00:32:11.430 --> 00:32:12.430
They called the coroner.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.980
Have you done a DNA
test after the deaths?

00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.120
No.

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.920
He instantly lost his job.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.335
They had the wrong
name of the person.

00:32:20.335 --> 00:32:22.690
And who they had
buried as Whitney Cerak

00:32:22.690 --> 00:32:24.704
was actually Laura Van Ryn.

00:32:24.704 --> 00:32:26.620
And the girl they thought
was Laura in the bed

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.670
was actually Whitney Sarack.

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:35.120
So one comes back to
change the grave marker.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.220
And the other goes home
thinking they had their daughter

00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.460
but didn't.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:44.740
You see, there is a
particularity to your life.

00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:48.370
Only God is big enough
in a world of billions

00:32:48.370 --> 00:32:53.410
of people to give you individual
worth and the individual access

00:32:53.410 --> 00:32:54.840
to a relationship.

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.470
Only God is big enough for
that in the created order.

00:32:59.470 --> 00:33:03.370
I will just mention two others,
and then [INAUDIBLE] third.

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:07.390
The second is the incarnation
from creation to incarnation.

00:33:07.390 --> 00:33:08.710
Third is transformation.

00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:11.290
And fourth is consummation.

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:14.800
And let me just talk
about the incarnation

00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:18.160
and miss the other two
because time has run out.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.350
In the incarnation
of Jesus Christ,

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:22.510
we see the absoluteness
of the moral law

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.130
and the supremacy of love.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.970
The absoluteness of the moral
law and the supremacy of love.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:32.240
And in that, the
absoluteness of the moral law

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:34.370
and the supremacy
of love, you go

00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:36.050
through any kinds of humanism.

00:33:36.050 --> 00:33:38.300
Evolutionary humanism,
behavioral humanism,

00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:41.780
existential humanism, pragmatic
humanism, Marxist humanism,

00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:44.060
existential humanism,
cultural humanism.

00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.480
You take all the six or seven
types of various humanisms.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.850
All of them struggle
with these two.

00:33:49.850 --> 00:33:52.520
Where do we find the
absolute moral law?

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:54.500
How do we find and
come to the conclusion

00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:56.210
of the supremacy of love?

00:33:56.210 --> 00:34:00.150
My daughter, who works with
the broken of this world,

00:34:00.150 --> 00:34:02.390
rescuing women from the
sex trafficking industry

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:05.619
and children with AIDS, she
has called me this morning

00:34:05.619 --> 00:34:06.160
from Atlanta.

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:10.940
She said, Dad, I have to give
a talk on pain and suffering,

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:14.439
and how meaning can
come out of that.

00:34:14.439 --> 00:34:15.730
Can we talk for a little while?

00:34:15.730 --> 00:34:16.920
It was early in the morning.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.100
She had forgotten I
was on California time.

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:21.719
And so anyway, we
talked about it.

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:25.080
And I said to her in a very
simple verse, God displayed

00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.590
for you and me in the
brokenness on the cross

00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:32.340
how the redemptive work of God
went on in your life and mine.

00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:34.380
So you see, he moves
us from creation

00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.340
to the incarnation to the key
point here that transformation.

00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:41.070
What is desperately
needed in this world,

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:44.639
is a transformed heart
and a transformed will,

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:47.190
and different hungers
that God alone

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:50.280
is big enough to give
within your heart and mind.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:52.920
I am a testimony to
it, and I will close

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:54.780
with a simple illustration.

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.730
I was 17 years old
growing up in India.

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:02.190
India is a country of incredible
pressure in academics.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.990
You don't just have to pass.

00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:06.001
You have to come at
the top of the class.

00:35:06.001 --> 00:35:07.500
And if you are not
going to make it,

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.610
you're going to bring
shame to the family.

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.640
The highest number of
suicides take place

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.830
in India within a week
after the results are

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.546
published in the newspapers.

00:35:16.546 --> 00:35:18.005
They are jumping off buildings.

00:35:18.005 --> 00:35:20.330
They're killing themselves.

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.192
They have words for
that kind of thing.

00:35:22.192 --> 00:35:23.900
I remember being called
that kind of word

00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.670
periodically by my dad
when I wasn't making it

00:35:26.670 --> 00:35:29.291
till, finally, it drove
me to a bed of suicide.

00:35:29.291 --> 00:35:30.790
And I said, I'm not
going to make it

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.900
in my father's estimation.

00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.150
And at the age of 17, a
bible was brought to me.

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:36.110
I didn't own a bible.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.780
I'd never opened a bible.

00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:39.710
I never cared for it.

00:35:42.430 --> 00:35:45.280
And to read in
that gospel story,

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.520
Jesus said because I
live, you also shall live.

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.222
And making my commitment
in all that blurred way,

00:35:51.222 --> 00:35:52.930
I'll never forget the
words of the doctor

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.400
when he came to discharge me.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:58.650
He looked at me, and he said
beta, which is Hindi for son.

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:01.810
Beta, I have given
you back your life,

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:03.550
but I cannot make
you want to live.

00:36:06.485 --> 00:36:08.860
I've given you back your life,
but I cannot make you want

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.670
to live.

00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:12.990
I said, doctor, that's
been taken care of already.

00:36:12.990 --> 00:36:16.150
And so I say to you,
with all of your success,

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:18.190
with all of the
intellectual prowess,

00:36:18.190 --> 00:36:23.320
and of the ability, what are you
really living for that's worth

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.850
giving your entire life for?

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:29.690
And what Christ says is when
he changes your heart and mind,

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:32.360
in that transformation
process, he

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:36.500
makes us live for the very
purpose God has made us.

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:38.700
Think of this for a moment.

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:41.240
Can you go to the
automobile manufacturer

00:36:41.240 --> 00:36:44.060
and tell them you are
creating a weapon?

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.390
You're creating a weapon.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:48.280
You are involved
in killing people

00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:50.710
on the streets of London,
on the streets of Paris,

00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:53.000
because you're making this
automobile as a weapon.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.820
They would look at
you and say, that's

00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.380
not what we intend this for.

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.880
Purpose, even in inanimate
objects, is so critical.

00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:08.720
How much more is
it for you and me?

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.600
A man who's no friend
to the Christian, who

00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:15.920
is an avowed atheist
and chooses to live

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.980
a life without boundaries,
name is Matthew Parris.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.950
He writes in the British
newspapers regularly.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:23.990
He wrote an article
some time back

00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:27.600
which is absolutely astounding.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.010
He goes to Africa to
see the work of NGOs.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:34.920
And he saw a small group
of Christians in Malawi.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.540
He was raised in Malawi.

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.570
He saw what these Christians
living a simple life

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.400
had accomplished in Malawi.

00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:44.460
He wrote a brilliant,
brilliant article.

00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.400
And I wish I had the time
to read all of it to you.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.980
But let me just leave
the last two paragraphs.

00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:52.200
There's long been a fashion
among Western academics

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:55.800
sociologists for placing tribal
value systems within a ring

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:56.550
fence.

00:37:56.550 --> 00:37:59.220
Beyond critiques founded in
[? theirs ?] and, therefore,

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.450
the best for them.

00:38:00.450 --> 00:38:03.600
Authentic and intrinsically
of equal worth to us.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:06.100
I simply don't
follow this anymore.

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:09.490
I observe that the tribal belief
is no more peaceable than ours,

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.970
and that it actually
suppresses individuality.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:13.830
People think
collectively this feeds

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:17.580
into the big man and gangster
politics of the African city.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.580
The exaggerated respect
for the swaggering leader

00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:22.530
and the literal
inability to understand

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:25.870
the whole idea of the loyal
opposition, anxiety, fear

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:28.410
of spirits of ancestors,
of nature in the wild,

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:30.300
strikes deep into
the whole structure

00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:31.890
of rural African thought.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:35.850
But great weight grinds down
upon the spirit of the people.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:39.600
Christianity, with its teaching
of a direct, personal, two-way

00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:42.420
link between the individual
and God unmediated

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:44.070
by the collective
and unsubordinate

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.020
to any other human
being, smashes

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:47.880
straight through the
philosophical spiritual

00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:49.590
framework I've just described.

00:38:49.590 --> 00:38:51.260
Those who want
Africa to walk tall

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.880
amid 21st century global
competition must not

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.490
kid themselves that
providing the material means

00:38:56.490 --> 00:38:58.140
or even the know-how
that accompanies

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.080
what we call development will
end up making the change.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:03.720
A whole belief system
has to be supplanted.

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.570
And I'm afraid it has to
be supplanted by another.

00:39:06.570 --> 00:39:10.890
Removing Christian evangelism
from the African equation

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:15.060
may leave the continent
at the mercy of a malign

00:39:15.060 --> 00:39:18.804
fusion of Nike, the witch
doctor, the mobile phone,

00:39:18.804 --> 00:39:19.470
and the machete.

00:39:23.853 --> 00:39:27.160
There's only one thing I
disagree with him on this.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:28.486
It's not just Africa.

00:39:28.486 --> 00:39:29.360
It's the whole world.

00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:36.870
The gospel of evangelism
that changes the heart

00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:39.060
is the only message
we have where

00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:43.230
I have seen in parts
of the world people who

00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:45.810
are one time heading
to behead others

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:50.220
now kneeling at an altar
in humility, and grace,

00:39:50.220 --> 00:39:51.750
and forgiveness.

00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:53.810
That is the gospel story.

00:39:53.810 --> 00:39:56.720
What does it mean to
be human from creation,

00:39:56.720 --> 00:39:59.010
to the incarnation,
to transformation,

00:39:59.010 --> 00:40:00.840
and consummation?

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.170
The bible gives us the
narrative very clearly.

00:40:04.170 --> 00:40:06.870
That's why Augustine said,
you have made us for yourself.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:08.820
And our hearts are
restless until they

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:11.010
find their rest in thee.

00:40:11.010 --> 00:40:12.780
Thank you so much
for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.530
