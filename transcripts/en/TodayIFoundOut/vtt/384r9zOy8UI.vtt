00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.730
Tsutomu Yamaguchi died from stomach cancer.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.080
The cancer part perhaps isn’t surprising
given that Yamaguchi is currently the only

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.610
person officially recognized by the Japanese
government as having lived through the atomic

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.020
bombings of both Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.930
(Note: There were actually well over a 100
or so others as well, perhaps as many as 165;

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.890
they just have never been officially recognized
by the Japanese government to date.)

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.070
What is surprising, given that history, is
that Yamaguchi avoided the disease for so

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.640
long, not dying until January 4, 2010, at
the age of 93.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.070
At the age of 29, Yamaguchi was on his way
back home from a three month long business

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.690
trip to Hiroshima on August 6, 1945.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.940
At the time, he was an engineer for Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries- specifically, working as

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.220
an oil tanker designer.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.970
On his way to the train station to head back
to his home in Nagasaki, he noticed he’d

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.560
forgotten his travel permit and went back
to get it while his colleagues, Akira Iwanaga

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.280
and Kuniyoshi Sato, went on.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.360
He picked up his pass and was on his way back
to the station when, at 8:15 a.m., he saw

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.039
a bomber flying over the city and “two small
parachutes”, then a rush of blinding light,

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:18.979
sound, wind, and heat knocked him to the ground.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.180
Mr. Yamaguchi had the misfortune of being
approximately 3 km from a nuclear blast.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.229
The immediate effects of this were his ear
drums rupturing, temporarily blindness, and

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.969
burns over much of his upper body.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.060
After his initial disorientation, and in spite
of his injuries, Tsutomu managed to make his

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.780
way to an air-raid shelter where he met up
with his two colleagues who had also survived

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.780
the blast.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.649
He spent the night in the shelter and in the
morning he and his co-workers headed back

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.380
to Nagasaki via train as originally planned.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.509
When he arrived, he received bandage treatments
from a local hospital, and even felt well

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.711
enough to report for work on August the 9th,
just 3 days later…

00:01:53.711 --> 00:01:54.711
(Now I feel like a bit of a pansy about taking
a full week off while I had the flu.)

00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:58.100
Of course, Yamaguchi had to explain his burns
to his coworkers.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.350
His boss was in disbelief over his claim that
it was a single explosion that destroyed much

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.350
of Hiroshima.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.109
“You’re an engineer,” he said to Tsutomu,
“calculate it…how could one bomb destroy

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.069
an entire city?”

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.580
The boss spoke too soon.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.420
According to Yamaguchi, during this conversation
the air-raid sirens went off and then, once

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.820
again, he saw a blinding white light.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.170
He dropped to the floor immediately; he was
familiar with the drill.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.480
Yamaguchi stated, “I thought the mushroom
cloud had followed me from Hiroshima.”

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.090
Both bombs exploded near the city centers
and both, interestingly enough, were just

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.250
about 3 kilometers away from Tsutomu’s position
at the time.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.750
Despite this explosion being slightly more
powerful than the one at Hiroshima (21 kilotons

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.310
vs. 16 kilotons at Hiroshima), thanks to the
city’s uneven terrain and the fact that

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.460
many parts of the city were divided by water,
which prevented the extensive fire damage

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.810
that happened in Hiroshima, there wasn’t
nearly the amount of overall infrastructure

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.810
damage.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.221
Yamaguchi himself experienced no immediate
injury from this second explosion, though

00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:58.320
of course was exposed to another high dose
of ionizing radiation and medical supplies

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.420
to treat his existing burns were now in short
supply.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.230
Interestingly, Yamaguchi almost didn’t have
to go through this ordeal twice.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.470
Nagasaki was not the original target for the
second nuke- that was the city of Kokura.

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.730
However, thanks to a cloud covering Kokura
when the bomber arrived, they had to divert

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.040
to a secondary target, Nagasaki, as the mission
stipulated that they were not to drop the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.020
bomb unless they had a visual of the target.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.130
When the bomber arrived at Nagasaki, they
also found significant cloud cover, but because

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.180
they were low on fuel, it was not possible
to divert to another target, so they made

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.520
their run anyways, despite their orders.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.300
When they got close, just before releasing,
they did have a brief visual to confirm their

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.290
location before dropping the bomb.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:42.030
Had they had more fuel or there not been a
cloud cover over Kokura, Yamaguchi and a not

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.100
insignificant portion of the Japanese population
would have had their lives drastically changed,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.310
some for the good and some for the bad.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.960
Surprisingly, unlike so many others who experienced
even just one of the blasts, Yamaguchi went

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.540
on to live a long and productive life with
the only major permanent physical health problem

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.510
as the result of the bombings being the loss
of hearing in his left ear, though the burns

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:12.430
took some time to heal; he temporarily lost
all his hair; and he experienced a great deal

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.800
of psychological trauma, as one might expect.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.820
He and his wife, Hisako, even went on to have
children, who all turned out perfectly healthy,

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.699
which at least at the time, not so much today,
was thought to be something of a miracle considering

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.690
both parents had been exposed to such high
levels of ionizing radiation.

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.240
Yamaguchi’s wife lived to 88, dying of kidney
and liver cancer.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.350
Yamaguchi himself lived to the ripe old age
of 93 years old and for most of his life made

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.350
little mention of the fact that he’d been
present at both bombings.

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:41.470
He initially just registered as a survivor
of Nagasaki.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.150
According to one of his daughters, his reasoning
for downplaying this, and not registering

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.460
as a survivor of Hiroshima as well, was his
robust health through most of his life.

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:54.340
He felt it would be disrespectful to the many
thousands who were not so lucky, health-wise.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.950
Once in his 80’s, he changed his stance,
breaking his silence on the matter and officially

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:02.370
applying for recognition as a survivor of
both blasts, which was granted by the Japanese

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.250
government in 2009, shortly before his death.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.639
He then dedicated the rest of his life to
campaigning for the disarmament of nuclear

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.940
weapons from all nations.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.210
He even wrote a book outlining his experience,
which included many poems he wrote about the

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.780
event (Raft of Corpses).

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.880
Despite it all, Yamaguchi considered himself
lucky.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:31.590
As he said shortly before his death, “I
could have died on either of those days.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:55.740
Everything 
that follows is a bonus.”
