00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
He was a massive figure in the world of theoretical physics.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.460
And many people wouldn't have heard of him.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:12.440
And yet, I think it'd be fair to say that his work led to the, probably, three Nobel prizes being awarded

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.440
- Not to him though?
- Not to him

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.600
And he could have been involved in so at least two of them...

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.000
...I think, he could have, if things would've turned out differently.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.040
He was actually born in 1932 in India, in Madras to...

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.500
...I think, British parents who were working over in India.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.040
He came back to Scotland to be educated at college in Scotland.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.740
And he spend his own undergraduate and postgraduate time at Edinburgh University.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.700
And then I think he went over to Caltech, for a period, for a year...

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.620
...before securing a position in the Imperial College, back in the late fifties...

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.680
...at the Imperial, and he stayed there until he died.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.640
So I knew him through his work on the cosmology.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.180
And that required a knowledge of particle physics, ...

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.040
...and that, in turn, requires a detailed knowledge of quantum field theory.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.880
Tom was a pioneer of that field.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.980
The work he developed, the techniques he developed, ...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.580
...have implications not only in particle physics, cosmology, ...

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.220
...but also in condensed matter physics.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.320
And so he was able to develop an area of physics...

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.920
...which is sort of interface between condensed matter and cosmology...

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.620
...as well as his pioneering work involving Higgs particle, ...

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.820
...early universe, phase transitions, symmetry breaking, ...

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.740
...gravity, and there was one thing I discovered.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.700
He worked in 1961 -- He wrote a paper...

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.660
...in which he looked at a modification of general relativity.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.860
I thought, recently, that I been seeing references to this paper of Tom's 1961.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.800
And I just look back in 2015 it had over a hundred citations...

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.640
...this paper he wrote.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.420
You know, that's the kind of impact he had across the fields.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.220
He was able to write things and laid dormant for a while and then people realize...

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.140
...Wow this is really really impressive stuff.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.240
The first and the one...

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.240
...that our Sixty Symbols viewers will know most about is probably the Higgs.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.840
Right? The discovery of the Higgs.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.580
Back in 2012 I think?

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.520
Which lead to the Nobel Prize in 2013.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.300
The mechanism, which is known as the Higgs Mechanism...

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.820
...was developed independently by 3 groups.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.600
One of those groups involed Tom.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.460
He wrote a paper that was published in...

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.260
...Physical Review Letters, and that has become one of...

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140
...the flagship papers that...

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.140
...they often cited as being one of their key...

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.640
...contributions to their journal.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.700
And he wrote it with his friends, Gulranik and Hagen.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.540
And because of this...

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.140
...crazy law or...

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.020
...rule, that we've discussed...

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.900
...that the Nobel Prize can only go to 3 people, ...

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.140
...they decided...

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.140
... I guess, they couldn't just give it to...

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.040
...Tom and not give it to the other two -- they were giving...

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.140
...it to Higgs and Englert, quite rightly.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.300
And so Tom missed out.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.540
Tom wrote a second -- probably even more influential paper-- He...

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.960
...actually was the person that demonstrated how...

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.000
...you can use this mechanism

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.300
...in the proper world of particle physics. And that we...

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.140
...knew that one of the...

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.200
...key particles in nature is the W and Z vector boson.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.140
These tells us about how the weak interactions behave.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.960
These are very massive particles.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.940
We didn't know how to give these masses, and Tom is the person...

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.600
...that actually demonstrated how you do this.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.020
He came up with the actual mathematical...

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.140
...formulas and...

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.440
...to introduce masses to these particles.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.680
This then, in 1967, ...

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.420
...he wrote this paper. So 3 years...

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.140
...after the Higgs Mechanism. He applied...

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.640
...it to this realistic situation.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.320
Provided the breakthrough that...

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.140
...helped Weinberg understand...

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.140
...the Standard Model of particle physics.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:43.840
And Salam.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.040
So Weinberg  and Salam shared the  Nobel...

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.140
...Prize with Sheldon Glashow for the...

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.960
...Standard Model of particle physics.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.960
It also had a knock-on effect that the...

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.920
...formulas that Tom had developed in this...

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.140
...1967 paper, the very mathematical...

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.440
...formulas, had helped Hooft and Veltman...

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.520
...understand that this model, ...

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.140
...Standard Model, was  what they...

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.620
...call renormalizable.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.560
This means that you can make actual predictions...

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.320
...with the model....

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.520
...basically. But...

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.020
...the formulas that...

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.220
...Tom had developed helped them.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.260
They had then got the Nobel Prize as well.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.440
And of course you have the fact that Tom...

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.140
...independently had discovered the Higgs mechanism...

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.960
...in 1964, which got...

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.420
...the Nobel Prize for Higgs and Englert.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.140
So 3 Nobel Prizes came out of...

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.560
work directly related to Tom.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.140
I found it...

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.140
...kind of the most humbling experience, I think...

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.140
...I've seen that day when...

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.140
...when the Nobel Prize was announced-- first of all...

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.140
...there was a delay. You might recall there was a delay...

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.140
...of over an hour when it turned out the delay was...

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.920
...that they were trying to find Higgs.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.140
But-- to let him know.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.140
But people would think maybe they told Tom...

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.140
...and Tom has turned it down because...

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.140
...he would have known that if he got it, his two...

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.560
...collaborators wouldn't have got it. But that wasn't the case.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.140
But I have read, ...

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.820
...since, that Tom told his son Robert, ...

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:55.900
...that uh...

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.040
...he was actually quite relieved not to have got the prize.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.140
Because if he...

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.140
...had've got the prize,  it would have been at the...

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.680
...expense of his close friends and collaborators...

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.860
...of the original paper.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.960
Well that's what Tom thought, so you'd have to go with his wishes, ...

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.360
...but what do you think of the fact he never got a Nobel Prize?

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.120
I mean, he did win a lot of prizes.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.140
He did win a lot of prizes.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.280
He is recognized as being a, you know...

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.580
...a giant in his field.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.660
I think it's sad that he didn't get it but I...

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.500
...fully appreciate...

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.680
...his, his attitude and his--

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.140
...I believe it. You know, the day of the--

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:32.140
...when the prizes were announced, he was being interviewed...

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.140
...all over the place, and...

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:36.140
...you didn't hear a single word of...

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.140
...bitterness, or criticism. The closest...

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.140
...it got where it was, he said, ...

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.740
...if they have these archaic rules...

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.140
...for the Nobel Prize...

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.140
...he can't get it. But he--

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.140
I knew him quite well; he was a good...

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:50.140
...friend and collaborator and he never, ...

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.140
...ever complained...

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.140
...or said anything...

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.140
...derogatory about...

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:58.140
...the award or the prize.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.640
Never.

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.140
What do you think he was bringing to the table that made him so exceptional?

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.160
What was his sort of unique selling point, his skill?

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:07.760
- Oh! What a good question! 
- What was Tom's thing?

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:09.840
Oh, Ok. So, I...

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.740
...was actually thinking about this today...

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.920
...before coming in. I think...

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.140
...a mathematically, incredibly...

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.140
...strong. He knew detailed...

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.720
...mathematics about areas known as group...

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.720
...theory and homotopy theory.

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.720
These played essential roles and...

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.920
...for example his understanding of group theories and...

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.920
...non-abelian gauge theories...

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.920
...allowed him to understand how this...

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.920
...vector boson could acquire a mass, ...

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:34.920
...for the W, whilst the...

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:36.380
...photon remained massless.

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.980
It was Tom that realized this.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.980
And so he brought this...

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:43.100
...very detailed mathematical knowledge...

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.880
...of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, group...

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.160
...theory, homotopy theory to the table...

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.880
...coupled with...

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.980
...this deep understanding of the physical side.

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:55.540
When I worked with him he would always be...

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.920
...asking about the...

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:58.700
...physical consequences of...

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.380
...a calculation, you know: does it make sense...

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.500
...physically? We're dealing with objects that are...

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:03.940
...meant to be in the universe.

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:04.740
Does it make sense?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:06.740
Can we already rule it out? And so he was a...

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.300
...physicist, but with a very strong mathematical bend.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:12.300
And that, I think, was his...

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.980
...unique thing that he-- well other people have it, but...

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.920
...he had it in this particular...

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:18.920
...combination which was just right.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:22.000
He was kind, he was gentle.

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.940
He was never afraid to tell you if he thought you were wrong.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:26.460
He was...

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.440
...determined to get things as accurately as possible.

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.440
The number of-- you know, I worked with him on quite a few...

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.440
...papers. I was privileged to do that, and...

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:35.360
...the number of iterations of papers where...

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.360
...we would be discussing words.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.360
There'll be a level of words: are we saying this right?

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.360
And the calculations...

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.140
...we would check, double check.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:43.640
 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.640
He was really rigorous in...

00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.360
...his approach.

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.360
But he had time for everyone. There are so...

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.840
...many stories of Tom being...

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.640
...sort of...

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:56.100
...people banging on his door when he was head of department...

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.100
...at Imperial and coming in almost off the...

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.020
...street-- some people -- to tell him...

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:01.040
...their ideas.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.320
And he would listen.

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.680
And he would listen to them, and then he would--

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.320
He'd probably say, "I don't know."

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.820
Rather than dismiss things,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.200
He would always listen. He always had time.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:14.720
Young scientists, like when I arrived at Imperial as a 24...

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.460
...year old, 25 year old.

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.460
He had so much time for people, ...

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:20.760
...and to listen and offer them advice.

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.400
There is a little story in that that might be worth...

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.740
...telling you about.

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.780
I got invited to give...

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:28.180
...a seminar at Imperial.

00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.440
They were considering hiring me for a postdoc.

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.660
I was at Newcastle doing a PhD...

00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.660
...and it wasn't in the area Tom worked.

00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.240
So I worked really hard at my presentation--

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.240
...it was at the time of transparencies.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.100
I made it way too technical, ...

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.400
...as new people-- new, fresh PhD. students do, ...

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.820
...'cause I was trying to impress.

00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:48.080
So I went down and gave this talk and...

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.600
...blew everyone away because it was too technical, ...

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.100
...apart from the few experts...

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.200
...who already knew it.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.200
So it wasn't great.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.360
And then after the talk Tom went off, ...

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.460
...he didn't ask any questions....

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.100
...he went off to his room because he was head of department.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.620
And my friend Ray Rivest said...

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.620
..."well you should go meet Tom, you know, he's...

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.420
...a famous guy and you might be-- you might be...

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.940
...here as a postdoc". So I went to his office...

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.940
...and sat down in his office, and...

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.700
...at his table and he smiled, ...

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.320
...and he didn't say anything. Nothing.

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:17.160
And I'm thinking, well, OK.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.620
And a few... felt like minutes went by.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.860
And eventually I said well it's me who's come to see him; ...

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860
...I should say something. So I said...

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.180
..."Professor Kibble, I know...

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.860
...you're a very important person, ...

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.100
...I really respect your work, and...

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:32.100
...I would like to know: what did you think?

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:34.440
Have you got any advice for me? I'm just starting."

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.760
And he looked at me and went, "Hmm."

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:38.760
"Don't write in yellow."

00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.240
All my transparencies, ...

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.240
...all my equations I had written in yellow.

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.640
None of them had projected onto the board.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.240
So every single equation nobody could see.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.080
So not only was it a really technical talk, ...

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.080
...nobody could see an equation.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:56.080
And that was his bit of advice. And then...

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.080
...we chatted a bit more and in fact, ...

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.740
...we uh, we began a...

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.900
...collaborations a couple years later...

00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:03.900
...when I returned to the UK.

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:05.900
And well, we had a fantastic time.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.000
Rather than just say, "Your talk was just rubbish," ...

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.220
...he just-- "Don't write in yellow."

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.220
Did you ever bring that up to him, years later?

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.060
Do you remember saying that to me?

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:19.080
I did! He just smiled. As he would.

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:19.840
He...

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.220
He would...

00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.400
Tom...

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.580
...wasn't afraid of silence. He didn't...

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.120
...feel the need-- he would never try and dominate--

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.780
...he hated being the center of attention. He just didn't want it.

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.420
But he would always be prepared to tell you...

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.340
...you know, ...

00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.560
...give his thoughts on something if you wanted to know, but...

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.440
..so you could go for tea with Tom and not say...

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.120
...anything and be fine.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.700
And initially it's a bit...

00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:42.600
...felt a bit...

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.020
...awkward, but then you realize oh no, it's fine.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:47.180
And then you'd say something and he'd reply and...

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:48.680
...it was all it was all grand.

00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:54.520
You can't... how do you then give it to three more?

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.480
Once I realized he hadn't got it, I just texted him and said...

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.960
...that I'm very sorry to hear you didn't get it.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.180
I think you deserved it.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:02.780
And... he replied.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.160
He replied almost immediately.

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.260
And he just said, "Thanks very much."

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:09.560
He's such a modest guy.

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:13.020
He didn't say, "I know! That was painful!"
