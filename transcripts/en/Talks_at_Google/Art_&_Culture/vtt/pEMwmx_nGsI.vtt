00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.590

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:40.321
All right, we go!

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:45.970
JON YOUSHAEI: And hey, guys.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.110
My name is Jon Youshaei.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:48.970
I'm going to be your
moderator this evening.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:50.830
Can you guys hear me
in the back all right?

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.530
Yeah?

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.030
All right.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.200
So I work at YouTube.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.630
I work on our influencer
and creator marketing,

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.480
which basically means I have to
watch a ton of videos every day

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.880
and get to know what's going
viral, who are our biggest

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.459
stars, from 1 million to
10 million subscribers,

00:01:03.459 --> 00:01:05.000
and just have a lot
of fun with that.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.750
I call it more of an
obsession than a profession,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.030
and it's something that I
never imagined at your age

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.200
that I'd be doing.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.580
And I just thought
I'd start off,

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.866
before we get to this amazing
panel that we have here,

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.490
just to give a little
bit more context,

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.830
because I think tonight
is all about dress code.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.190
It's all about fashion
and tech, but it's also

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.140
all about paying it forward.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.650
Right?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.640
And I think if you ask
anybody on this panel,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.590
we'll get into it.

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.410
If you ask myself, if you
ask anybody behind you,

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.000
tonight's all about
giving what we

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.190
got when we were in your shoes.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.440
And nobody got to
this place alone.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.380
And I want to ask you guys in
high school, how many of you

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.640
guys know what you want
to be when you grow up?

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.460
Really?

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.301
OK.

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:43.800
Awesome.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.258
So I wanted to tell
you two things.

00:01:45.258 --> 00:01:48.690
There's no such
thing as growing up.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.020
No such thing.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.999
In fact, one of my favorite
quotes is that "growing up

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.040
is the moment you realize
there's no such thing."

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.810
Tweet it, tweet it.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.970
That's good.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.710
And there's no
such thing as being

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.345
one thing when you grow up.

00:02:08.345 --> 00:02:10.750
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.710
And lastly, the things that the
people that raise their hand, I

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.370
applaud you.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.960
You guys know more than
I ever did in your shoes.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.860
But I guarantee you, what you
want to be today will change,

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.700
and all I have to
say is embrace it.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.560
Your career will change a ton.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.060
You will change a ton.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.700
You'll get a lot of advice
from mentors, some of which

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.440
you'll meet today,
others of which you'll

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.500
meet in the most unexpected ways
on this journey we call life.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.150
And I just encourage
you to go with it.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.650
There's no wrong
answers and there's

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.290
a place for everyone in this
world when it comes to finding

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.468
what's right for you.

00:02:43.468 --> 00:02:45.848
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:48.541 --> 00:02:49.040
Awesome.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.030
So let's get into our panel.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.455
Let's give it up one more
time for them for coming out.

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:54.830
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.350
We got two mics.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.590
All right.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.090
Cool.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.950
So I thought I'd
start things off--

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.550
I'm always-- one
of the questions

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.430
I love asking people
is, what are you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.702
most proud of in your past?

00:03:05.702 --> 00:03:07.910
And, what are you most
excited about in your present?

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.670
So if you want to talk a
little bit about yourself.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.461
But just mention, of
all the amazing things

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:12.970
you guys have done
on this panel,

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.340
what's something you're
most proud of in your past?

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.923
And what's something that you're
excited about, moving forward

00:03:17.923 --> 00:03:18.790
in the future?

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.290
We'll start with you
if you want to take it.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.623
Or if you want to work on it,
we could start over there.

00:03:22.623 --> 00:03:24.958
CIERRA RAMIREZ: Let's start
on the end right here.

00:03:24.958 --> 00:03:26.272
[LAUGHS]

00:03:26.272 --> 00:03:28.460
DARREN MOULDEN: OK, so for
me, I'm just going to--

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.850
JON YOUSHAEI: You want to bring
the mic up so we can hear you.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.558
DARREN MOULDEN: A
little backstory on me.

00:03:31.558 --> 00:03:34.520
So I went to school
for six years.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.600
I did six years of college
and graduated with a doctorate

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.430
of pharmacy degree.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.530
I graduated, and I
realized that I hated it.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:50.080
And I also wanted to tap
into my creative side

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.990
and kind of do what I
was passionate about.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.500
And so going back to his
question, I'm proud of the fact

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.810
that I'm a pharmacist,
but I'm also

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.660
proud that I had the courage
enough to go after what

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.790
it is that I love to do.

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.670
Because like he said,
you never grew up.

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.059
And so at 17, when
you're told, OK, it's

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:09.850
time for you to pick
a major and figure out

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.250
what it is that you want to
do for the rest of your life,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:13.900
you don't always know.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.630
And you go into something,
and you complete it,

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:19.240
and then it's like,
OK, I'm stuck.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.800
But you're never stuck.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.360
So you always have
to know that you

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.840
have the power to do whatever
it is that you put your mind to.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.610
So that's how I went into it.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:30.110
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.068
JON YOUSHAEI: Do you want
to take the next one?

00:04:32.068 --> 00:04:34.270
CLOE FELDMAN: Hi, I'm Cloe.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.580
I think something I'm
proud of myself in my past

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.480
is that I always have
really considered education

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.740
a huge part of what I do.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.654
Even though now I'm
doing YouTube full-time,

00:04:44.654 --> 00:04:45.820
all throughout high school--

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.990
I've been doing YouTube
for seven years.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.330
So all throughout high
school, like, I really

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.421
focused on learning, talked
about it in my videos,

00:04:51.421 --> 00:04:53.920
talked about studying for the
ACTs and applying to colleges.

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.003
And it's always been
something I've really pushed.

00:04:56.003 --> 00:04:58.060
So I think no
matter what you do,

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.680
bringing education into
it is very important.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.490
And then just something
I'm focusing on right

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.220
now is building a
team and learning more

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.600
about the industry,
learning more

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.130
about what message I want
to spread to everyone.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:12.130
JON YOUSHAEI: Beautiful.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.292
CLOE FELDMAN: Thank you.

00:05:13.292 --> 00:05:14.244
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:14.244 --> 00:05:17.100
JON YOUSHAEI: Give it up.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.180
ALE LA CHULA: Hi, I'm Ale.

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.854
I do YouTube as well.

00:05:20.854 --> 00:05:22.270
I think one of the
things that I'm

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.930
most proud of is
that I never gave up.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.590
The journey getting to where
I am at today was not easy.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.280
But I love that it wasn't easy
because it made me who I am.

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.060
And, yeah, I mean it
took me about four years.

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.830
And it was actually longer
than that, but once I started--

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.540
committed myself-- it
took me about four years.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.380
But it wasn't easy.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.380
And a lot of the things
that you guys are

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:49.880
going to be passionate about
or that you guys love, you guys

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.890
will find out that
it's not easy.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.250
So never, ever give
up on your dreams.

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.060
Always work hard,
believe in yourself.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:58.990
And I always say that if
you put the time and effort,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.520
you guys can make
anything happen.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:06.250
And now I have YouTube,
and I have three channels.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:08.560
I also have a couple
businesses that I've

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.850
started with my husband.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.384
And that's my future now, so.

00:06:12.384 --> 00:06:13.300
JON YOUSHAEI: Awesome.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.775
That's amazing.

00:06:13.775 --> 00:06:14.275
Give it up.

00:06:14.275 --> 00:06:16.077
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:16.077 --> 00:06:16.910
What about you, Jon?

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.130
JON PHENOM: Yep.

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:18.005
Can you guys hear me?

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.870
So here's what I want to say.

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.010
This is actually
pretty big for me.

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.960
This is probably a
big moment for me.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.990
It's a milestone for me.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.040
I have a crazy story in fashion.

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.360
I've been professionally in
fashion for the last 18 years.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.100
I just I just had my birthday,
so believe it or not,

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:41.380
me and my twin brother
just turned 40.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.130
JON YOUSHAEI: Wow.

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:42.823
JON PHENOM: Yeah.

00:06:42.823 --> 00:06:43.710
JON YOUSHAEI: That's amazing.

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.610
JON PHENOM: Well--
you're clapping for it?

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:49.870
What cameras-- Alex, we
still look good, bro.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.580
So real quick, what
I wanted to say

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:55.480
is I'm Filipino
and not Hispanic,

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.641
but in New York and Florida,
apparently I'm Puerto Rican.

00:06:58.641 --> 00:06:59.140
So--

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.846
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:59.846 --> 00:07:02.230
But what I want to
say is, I'm Filipino,

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.420
and your parents want you to
be an engineer or a nurse.

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.780
And so I met someone who
worked for Russell Simmons

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.452
when I was 18, and
he designed clothing.

00:07:10.452 --> 00:07:12.160
And I never knew that
that could be a job

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.050
that I could design streetwear.

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.560
And so I was like, that's crazy.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.770
This event is big for me because
I also teach in a high school.

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:24.100
So shout to Frontier
and La Serna High,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.330
everybody in Whittier.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.710
Shout-out to everybody there.

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.510
But I was telling my students--

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.120
you know, I always tell
my students is like,

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.670
at the point when I started
to search my career,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:35.830
I went backwards, and I
said, what do I want to do?

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.320
So of course everyone wants
to be a baller, right?

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.526
So I wanted to make money,
and I wanted to travel,

00:07:40.526 --> 00:07:41.900
and I wanted
something different.

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.430
So when I met a designer, I was
like, that's what I want to do.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.550
I took my folks, I sat them
down, I was 18 years old,

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.500
and I was like, OK.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.530
Don't freak out.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:53.530
I'm going to drop
out of college.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.090
And I said, don't
worry, I'm going

00:07:55.090 --> 00:07:56.620
to become an apparel designer.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.000
And they thought I was crazy.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.700
My twin brother told me
later that they were like,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.514
convince John to
go back to school.

00:08:02.514 --> 00:08:03.430
So I did go to school.

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.890
I learned the classes, all
my graphic design programs

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:06.970
and everything.

00:08:06.970 --> 00:08:09.430
And there's a reason
I'm on the panel today.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.220
I was a director of the last
three companies I've been with.

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:15.220
I've managed multiple
multimillion-dollar clothing

00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.970
lines.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.310
And yeah, so it's been a
great story for me, man.

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:19.870
YouTube channel
helps people learn

00:08:19.870 --> 00:08:21.280
how to launch clothing lines.

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.447
So that's what I'm proud of.

00:08:22.447 --> 00:08:23.363
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:08:23.363 --> 00:08:24.172
Give it up.

00:08:24.172 --> 00:08:26.527
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:29.739
BRITTANY DKE: Oh, you
are waiting for me.

00:08:29.739 --> 00:08:30.780
JON YOUSHAEI: Yeah, yeah.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:33.446
BRITTANY DKE: Oh my god, I can't
believe I'm on stage right now.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:36.150
I've been getting panic
attacks, heart attacks.

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:37.620
I'm here.

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.450
OK, so my name is Brittany.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.133
My channel is fashion-related.

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:43.049
I teach people how to
make their own garments.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:44.910
The outfit that I'm
wearing right now I

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.410
have a tutorial for.

00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:49.080
So it's a skirt and a wrap top.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.920
And I'm just really proud
of how far my YouTube

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.610
channel have grown, especially
being a sewing channel.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.220
That's like one of the
least-searched thing

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.140
on YouTube.

00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.890
But what I did to really
stand out on YouTube,

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:07.270
I used to intern for
Michael Costello,

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:11.180
and so I really started
doing trending fashion.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:15.990
So what I realized was
people wasn't putting out

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:17.280
gown tutorials.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.700
So I would show people
how to make your own gown

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:22.180
or how to make a wedding dress.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:26.160
So the stuff that people would
send me from all over the world

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.870
was like amazing.

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:30.210
So I do have a
clothing line now,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.980
and I'm just really
excited to see

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:33.320
where it takes off from now.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320
JON YOUSHAEI: I love it.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.181
Give it up.

00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:37.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:09:40.159 --> 00:09:42.700
So there's a few things in there
that I want to dive deep on.

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:45.207
First I want to say how
awesome is that they really

00:09:45.207 --> 00:09:46.040
owned that question.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:47.750
When somebody asks you
what you're proud of

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.040
and all of that, you
shouldn't shy away.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.623
I love how you guys really talk
about all the hard work you've

00:09:51.623 --> 00:09:54.502
put in and all the great things
that have come about that.

00:09:54.502 --> 00:09:56.460
Jon, you mentioned
something really interesting

00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.070
that I think-- you know,
when you're in high school,

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.960
your parents obviously have
a huge influence on you,

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.760
as they do throughout
the rest of your life.

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.180
And they always want
the best for you.

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:05.720
But I think it's so interesting
growing up in today's world

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.910
where many of the
professions that we'll take

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:10.040
aren't even in existence yet.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.230
And I want to talk about
to each of you guys,

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:15.200
how did you have that initial
conversation with your parents

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:17.770
that you were going to do
what your heart desired

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:19.010
and what you're doing now?

00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:21.080
And do you have any advice
for people in the audience who

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.260
may be thinking the same thing?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.320
Like maybe your parents--
it doesn't have to be,

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.580
hey, I'm dropping out of school.

00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:27.080
It has to be more
like, hey, I don't

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.460
want to be a doctor, a lawyer.

00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:29.670
I want to do something else.

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.090
Do you have advice for
people in the audience that

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.940
may be wanting to do a
more untraditional path

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:39.800
as untraditional becomes more
of the norm in today's world?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.425
Open to anyone.

00:10:40.425 --> 00:10:40.960
Jump in.

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.790
Jump in.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:44.600
ALE LA CHULA: I feel like
obviously our parents love us,

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:47.690
so if they see that you're truly
passionate about something,

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.910
maybe in the beginning
they'll be very shocked

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.490
and they'll maybe try
to talk you out of it.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:55.827
But when they see passion
and dedication, I mean,

00:10:55.827 --> 00:10:57.410
I'm sure they're
going to support you.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.860
But always start everything with
honesty, and if what they want

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.980
is not what you want,
speak up, obviously.

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:06.392
It's going to be your life.

00:11:06.392 --> 00:11:07.850
It's going to be
your time, and you

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.200
have to make sure that
whatever it is that you do,

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.491
you're truly passionate about
it because it's something

00:11:11.491 --> 00:11:15.350
that you're going to have to
dedicate a lot of time into it.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.179
So.

00:11:16.179 --> 00:11:17.720
JON YOUSHAEI: Yeah,
beautifully said.

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:18.320
Anybody else?

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.412
Any other thoughts?

00:11:19.412 --> 00:11:20.870
BRITTANY DKE: Well,
for me, luckily

00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:22.940
my parents are
really supportive.

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.770
I just remember-- I
barely learned how

00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:27.020
to sew three or four years ago.

00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.980
But I remember when I
was three years old,

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.060
I made my mom a pair of
shoes out of newspaper,

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:35.490
and she wore those
around the house.

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:36.440
Yes.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.090
But she didn't realize--

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:39.470
she knew I loved
fashion, but she

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:43.130
didn't realize how big
it would be for me now,

00:11:43.130 --> 00:11:46.400
because I'm designing
for celebrities,

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.400
and I've been working
for Michael Costello.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.540
I had to say that again.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:51.740
JON YOUSHAEI: I was going to
say, name prompt, name prompt.

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:53.270
BRITTANY DKE: He
designed dresses

00:11:53.270 --> 00:11:54.402
for Beyonce, Lady Gaga--

00:11:54.402 --> 00:11:55.610
JON YOUSHAEI: Casual, casual.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.330
BRITTANY DKE: --and
Britney Spears.

00:11:56.330 --> 00:11:57.750
I could keep going on and on.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.830
But when you're really
passionate about something,

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:03.480
I just feel like
you'll succeed in it.

00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:05.479
And that's how I
felt with my fashion.

00:12:05.479 --> 00:12:06.770
JON YOUSHAEI: That's beautiful.

00:12:06.770 --> 00:12:08.740
And I think it also
goes to say, there's

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:10.370
7 billion people in the world.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:11.905
Like, small is big.

00:12:11.905 --> 00:12:14.030
There's people who share
the same interests as you.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.900
So if you're passionate
about something,

00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.950
then there's generally a
lot of people out there.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:20.199
And one of the reasons I'm
so proud to work at YouTube

00:12:20.199 --> 00:12:21.960
is that YouTube
gives that access.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.290
So you have an idea, you
can just upload, connect,

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.080
and who knows where that
will take you later?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:30.441
Any other thoughts about the
parent conversation or advice?

00:12:30.441 --> 00:12:30.940
Yeah.

00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:32.565
JON PHENOM: Just a
couple quick points.

00:12:32.565 --> 00:12:33.530
I should say this.

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:36.530
I did drop out of college,
but I went back later

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:38.117
while I was working full time.

00:12:38.117 --> 00:12:39.950
I went back to school
online so that I could

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.100
teach at a high school, OK?

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.340
I'm not just-- so I'm a huge--

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:45.465
my twin brother is actually
an assistant principal.

00:12:45.465 --> 00:12:46.214
JON YOUSHAEI: Wow.

00:12:46.214 --> 00:12:47.780
JON PHENOM: Yeah,
so I'm a huge fan--

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:48.200
JON YOUSHAEI: Full circle.

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:49.520
JON PHENOM: --of education.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:51.590
But what I want to say for--

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.134
what I always say
to my students--

00:12:53.134 --> 00:12:54.800
so this is like a big
classroom for me--

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.839
is, studies are
showing that you're

00:12:56.839 --> 00:12:58.880
going to work in a couple
of different industries

00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.680
by the time you guys go
to get your careers, OK?

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.440
So that tells me
a lot of things.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.470
Your degree is going
to be about the ability

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:10.130
to go through tough finals
and to weather through it,

00:13:10.130 --> 00:13:11.750
but you also need
to have flexibility

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:14.330
in terms of having a skill
set that you can then

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:16.970
put to something else, right?

00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:19.070
And real quick, I
just want to say,

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:22.224
on that note of attacking
what you want to do,

00:13:22.224 --> 00:13:23.390
you brought up a good point.

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:23.990
You're going to do it.

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.090
You're going to be in
the workplace more then

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:28.140
you're going to be with
your family, your wife,

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:29.720
your husband, your kids later.

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.886
So it's got to be something
you're passionate about.

00:13:31.886 --> 00:13:35.510
And in terms of attacking
it, what I don't see

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.520
is sometimes the hunger.

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.700
So you've got to be
relentless about it.

00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.300
Quick story.

00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:44.360
When I lived in San Diego,
I found the 10 brands

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.040
that I wanted to work for.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.360
And this was before
internet, OK?

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.840
There's the portion about
coding and everything.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.190
So when I speak I'll say, we
used the term "computer nerd"

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:56.630
when I was in high
school and then

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.330
it gets-- just like this--
it gets nothing, right?

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.979
But before, it was I
can afford a computer.

00:14:01.979 --> 00:14:03.020
I mean, it was expensive.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:04.890
Now everybody got
it on their phone.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:07.890
But you've got to be relentless
about really attacking it.

00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:09.500
So I found 10 brands.

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.340
I researched.

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.300
I went to them and I said, hey,
I'm going to be a designer.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.220
I'm not one right now, and
I will drive from San Diego

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:17.892
to get you coffee.

00:14:17.892 --> 00:14:19.850
And then when they said,
no, I would come back,

00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:21.470
and I'd have 10 questions.

00:14:21.470 --> 00:14:22.629
How did you get this job?

00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:24.170
What's the best
thing about this job?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:25.070
What sucks about it?

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:26.240
What's a tough month?

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.090
What's a good month?

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.006
What's a high and low?

00:14:28.006 --> 00:14:29.190
Those sort of things.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.280
So a couple of pieces
of advice there,

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.140
but that's the
kind of mind state

00:14:33.140 --> 00:14:34.520
that I have when I attack it.

00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.190
And so for this
18-year career, I've

00:14:37.190 --> 00:14:39.920
done a little bit of
styling on music videos.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:42.980
I was doing, you know,
I was a fashion editor

00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:45.590
for a little bit, but it's
all been around brands.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.890
But I use the same skill set
onto the next kind of venture.

00:14:48.890 --> 00:14:51.050
And you guys should
have that too when

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:52.259
you're attacking your career.

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:53.466
JON YOUSHAEI: That's amazing.

00:14:53.466 --> 00:14:54.117
Wow.

00:14:54.117 --> 00:14:56.602
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.260
Any other thoughts
on the parent--

00:14:59.260 --> 00:14:59.360
yep?

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.984
CLOE FELDMAN: Yeah, I definitely
agree with what you're saying.

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:05.610
Like anything you guys want to
do, if you want it bad enough,

00:15:05.610 --> 00:15:06.520
you can do it.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.090
And I think that's how it was
with my YouTube and still is.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.400
I literally live,
breathe YouTube.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:13.950
I am posting videos every
day, sometimes twice a day,

00:15:13.950 --> 00:15:15.850
and it's taken over my life.

00:15:15.850 --> 00:15:17.350
But I love it so much.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:18.360
And I was in school.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:19.350
I went to UCLA.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.810
My dad is really,
really big on education

00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:24.510
and has always been like
it's his main thing.

00:15:24.510 --> 00:15:27.330
But he saw how passionate I
was about what I was doing

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.170
and how successful
I was becoming.

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.430
And I think if you have
that drive for something,

00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:36.210
and maybe it's not exactly
like what your parents think

00:15:36.210 --> 00:15:39.750
you're going to do, I
think just going for what

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.247
your heart is saying, yeah.

00:15:42.247 --> 00:15:43.830
JON YOUSHAEI: That's
beautifully said.

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.570
DARREN MOULDEN: I would say
to just do your research

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.220
and present them
with that research.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:49.470
And just kind of
like the same reason

00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:52.230
that you want to do it and the
vision that you have for it,

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:54.630
just present it to them.

00:15:54.630 --> 00:15:58.170
And research it and
show them somebody

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:01.840
that's successful at it already,
and that would be a good way.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.020
And then also just always
come up with a plan.

00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:05.490
So maybe it is
that you do end up

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:09.420
having to go to
college for something

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:12.692
that may be more career-driven
and not your passion.

00:16:12.692 --> 00:16:14.400
Well, then maybe your
plan is that you'll

00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:16.770
use that career to
fuel your passion

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:18.140
or to fund your passion.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.944
So it's evolved
like having a plan.

00:16:19.944 --> 00:16:21.360
As long as you
have a plan and you

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.760
know exactly where you
want to go at the end,

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.340
I think that's most important.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:26.780
JON YOUSHAEI: That's amazing.

00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:29.160
I think a lot of you guys talked
about mentorship and looping

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:29.940
in older people.

00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.520
And I think there's a quote
that's, it's great to learn

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.103
from your mistake, but it's even
better to learn from somebody

00:16:35.103 --> 00:16:36.150
else's.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.810
Right?

00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:38.400
And that's what
mentorship gives you.

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:40.164
Can tweet that one out, too.

00:16:40.164 --> 00:16:41.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.420
So I want to talk about, a lot
of people talk about hustle.

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.310
Like a lot of people say go
out there, go hard, like, eat,

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:50.967
sleep, and drink your work.

00:16:50.967 --> 00:16:52.050
You guys have all done it.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:55.110
I think the thing that would
make it really specific

00:16:55.110 --> 00:16:57.384
and add a lot of color to
it is if you guys could tell

00:16:57.384 --> 00:16:59.383
maybe a story of something
like, now some of you

00:16:59.383 --> 00:17:00.840
have got millions
of subscribers,

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.548
you're reaching so
many people every day.

00:17:02.548 --> 00:17:03.600
Let's rewind back.

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:07.589
Like, what's a story of a
moment where something clicked,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:10.079
you did something, you put
in the work that other people

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:10.589
didn't?

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.930
I think the more
specific we get here,

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.170
it'll really add a
lot of color to what

00:17:16.170 --> 00:17:17.452
you have to do to get here.

00:17:17.452 --> 00:17:19.410
Because it's more than
just saying nice things,

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:20.520
it's actually doing them.

00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:23.930
And you guys have all done it.

00:17:23.930 --> 00:17:25.889
Go ahead, yeah.

00:17:25.889 --> 00:17:27.680
ALE LA CHULA: So before
YouTube, I actually

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.660
went to FIDM, which
is a fashion school.

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:33.350
I've loved fashion since
I was in high school.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:36.650
And when I discovered
YouTube, I actually

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.512
discovered it because
my husband was like,

00:17:38.512 --> 00:17:39.470
oh, there's this video.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:40.550
I didn't even know
what YouTube was.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.258
But I went on YouTube,
and then somehow I

00:17:42.258 --> 00:17:45.260
trickled across a beauty video.

00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:46.310
It was a haul video.

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.040
And I instantly became
fascinated with the fact

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:51.920
that somebody can
actually share the things

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.420
that they were buying.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:56.270
I always see things from
a business perspective.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:58.430
Back then, the video
that I was watching,

00:17:58.430 --> 00:18:00.590
I think it had
about 20,000 views.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.080
And I said, oh my gosh,
if 20,000 people saw

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:06.680
this video of her
haul video, then

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:09.980
if 1% of these people actually--
if I had a website and 20,000

00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:12.872
people can watch the stuff that
I sell on my website and 1%

00:18:12.872 --> 00:18:14.330
would go on my
website, then that's

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:16.663
like, so many people that can
buy stuff from my website.

00:18:16.663 --> 00:18:18.870
So I always saw it from
a business perspective.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:20.554
So then my husband
bought me a computer

00:18:20.554 --> 00:18:22.220
and I started filming
my videos at home.

00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:23.720
And obviously I
thought it was going

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.910
to be like an instant
sensation, but nobody

00:18:25.910 --> 00:18:27.220
was watching my videos.

00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:29.120
And I was very frustrated.

00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:33.036
I did it for about two years,
and I had 1,000 subscribers.

00:18:33.036 --> 00:18:35.660
And I would stay up till, like,
3:00, 4:00 in the morning and I

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.970
would Google, how can I get
more views on my videos?

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.830
What hashtags should
I use on my videos?

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.780
Or what tags should
I put on my videos?

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:45.576
I would not sleep because
I wanted this so bad,

00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:47.200
and I had to figure
out a way to do it.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.520
And despite the fact that
nobody was watching my videos

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:52.054
and people would laugh at me
for still filming and uploading

00:18:52.054 --> 00:18:54.470
and editing, I was still doing
it because it was something

00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:56.750
that I truly, truly loved.

00:18:56.750 --> 00:18:59.990
Fast forward about
three years after that.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.170
My brother said, you know, they
make these videos in Spanish.

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:06.500
And the first thing I did
was I went into YouTube,

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.479
and I typed in
"what's in my bag?"

00:19:08.479 --> 00:19:10.520
That was one of the big
popular videos back then.

00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:13.760
It was about 100,000
videos came up.

00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:16.100
And then I typed in
[SPEAKING SPANISH],, which

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.350
is the same exact
thing, but in Spanish.

00:19:18.350 --> 00:19:21.140
And it was about 300 videos.

00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:22.620
And I speak Spanish.

00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:25.310
So then I thought to
myself, this market

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:27.050
has not been tapped into.

00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.450
So I started uploading
videos in Spanish.

00:19:29.450 --> 00:19:30.260
I didn't give up.

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:31.760
I didn't give up
on the fact that--

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:33.009
I'm uploading, I'm uploading--

00:19:33.009 --> 00:19:35.900
I was trying to figure out
ways on how I can get in there.

00:19:35.900 --> 00:19:38.000
My YouTube channel
now has over-- it

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.100
has 1.3 million subscribers.

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:40.850
JON YOUSHAEI: Wow.

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:41.210
ALE LA CHULA: If
you would have--

00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.310
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:43.600
Thank you.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.470
If you guys would
have told me that I

00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.610
was going to have a channel
that big four or five

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.230
years ago, I would
have been like,

00:19:51.230 --> 00:19:52.910
yeah, I'm dreaming
about it, but I

00:19:52.910 --> 00:19:54.200
don't think I'm actually
going to ever get there

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.700
because no one is
watching my stuff.

00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.470
So I don't even remember
what the question was,

00:19:58.470 --> 00:19:59.437
but if you guys--

00:19:59.437 --> 00:20:00.770
JON YOUSHAEI: A story of hustle.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:01.410
I think you nailed it.

00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:02.160
ALE LA CHULA: Yes.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.890
So I did not sleep,
trying to figure out

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:06.290
how I can make this happen
because I truly wanted it.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.260
And I guess moral of the story
is if you guys want something,

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:12.250
even if it doesn't seem like
it's going to happen for you,

00:20:12.250 --> 00:20:14.150
I promise if you guys
keep working at it,

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.824
you eat, breathe, sleep your
passion, you guys will make it.

00:20:17.824 --> 00:20:18.740
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:21.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.870
Any other stories of hustle?

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:27.280
BRITTANY DKE: Well,
for me, before YouTube

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.920
I was working at Disneyland.

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:30.420
Yeah.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:30.720
JON YOUSHAEI: Right.

00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.270
[SQUEALS FROM AUDIENCE]

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.610
BRITTANY DKE: Yeah, the
happiest place on earth.

00:20:33.610 --> 00:20:35.401
JON YOUSHAEI: Got some
Disney fans up here.

00:20:35.401 --> 00:20:36.570
BRITTANY DKE: So they say.

00:20:36.570 --> 00:20:37.930
But no.

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:41.410
I just remember when I
started working at Disneyland,

00:20:41.410 --> 00:20:44.020
I started my YouTube
channel, but I would always

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.440
find myself sketching out
outfits at the register.

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.480
And I'm just like,
you know, there'll

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:51.814
be a time to clock out, and
I'd be, like, all right.

00:20:51.814 --> 00:20:53.230
And then I'm
scrubbing the gutters

00:20:53.230 --> 00:20:54.854
and I'm just like,
why am I doing this?

00:20:54.854 --> 00:20:56.320
It's not fun.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.430
So what I did was I
took my last paycheck,

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:03.260
and that's when I
started my business.

00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:06.400
And so it kind of
launched from there.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:10.990
And then I took a percentage
of that last paycheck,

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.680
and then I used
it for my YouTube

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:16.410
to invest in better
equipment, material.

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.207
And so from there,
everything seems

00:21:19.207 --> 00:21:20.290
to have worked out for me.

00:21:20.290 --> 00:21:24.290
But YouTube definitely
takes a lot of hard work.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:25.930
A lot of hard work.

00:21:25.930 --> 00:21:31.090
I find myself sewing at 5:00 in
the morning, but it's so fun.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.167
Oh my god, like I'm
sewing, and it's just like,

00:21:35.167 --> 00:21:36.250
it doesn't feel like work.

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.420
I mean, it's fun.

00:21:37.420 --> 00:21:40.510
So basically what
I'm trying to say

00:21:40.510 --> 00:21:43.180
is, if you have a
passion about something,

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.230
definitely go and do it,
because that's like the best

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.229
thing you could do.

00:21:48.229 --> 00:21:49.270
JON YOUSHAEI: Absolutely.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.811
And if I could build
on that, I think

00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:53.890
that you touched on something
very important, which is--

00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:56.110
what do you guys
procrastinate with?

00:21:56.110 --> 00:22:00.310
Because that's probably what
you're passionate about.

00:22:00.310 --> 00:22:01.480
Right?

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:03.169
Like you spend the free time--

00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:04.960
we'll do some audience
Q&amp;A after this, yep.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:09.170
So there's a lot
of things that--

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:11.420
growing up, people tell
you to do a lot of things,

00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:13.210
especially when you're
at your age, right?

00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.220
But the thing that you
should probably be doing

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.480
is what you're most
passionate about.

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.370
If you find yourself
coding until the wee

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.800
hours of the night, you
should probably be a coder.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.370
You know?

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.630
Don't fight your instincts.

00:22:22.630 --> 00:22:24.310
Like, there is a
place for everyone.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.355
And just like you did, if you
have a job and at some point

00:22:28.355 --> 00:22:30.480
you will have to find a
way to make ends meet, find

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.010
in-between work, but
if you find yourself

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.290
doing that in your free
time and procrastinating,

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:36.250
then that's probably
what you should

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:37.570
be doing as a profession.

00:22:37.570 --> 00:22:38.620
And there's a way.

00:22:38.620 --> 00:22:39.421
We are lucky.

00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:41.920
We are so lucky to live in this
day and age, where you could

00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:44.380
turn that into something
that has an audience

00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:46.600
and reach people all
around the world.

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:49.840
I think I also want to point
out from your story, the words

00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.364
"overnight success," that's
a total oxymoron, right?

00:22:54.364 --> 00:22:55.280
There's no such thing.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.730
It takes years to be
an overnight success,

00:22:57.730 --> 00:22:59.800
and that's how
people perceive you.

00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:01.889
So I see it a lot in
part of my day job.

00:23:01.889 --> 00:23:04.180
A lot of people start on
YouTube, they're very excited,

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:05.596
but they don't
have the dedication

00:23:05.596 --> 00:23:07.406
that a lot of you guys all did.

00:23:07.406 --> 00:23:09.280
It sounds like we'll
open it to the audience.

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.890
I want to give you guys a
final word before we open it up

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:12.432
to questions.

00:23:12.432 --> 00:23:13.931
Is there anything
that you guys want

00:23:13.931 --> 00:23:16.630
to talk about, like things that
you want people to know about?

00:23:16.630 --> 00:23:18.144
I want to continue
the conversation

00:23:18.144 --> 00:23:20.560
if you want to give your Twitter
handles or your Instagram

00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.601
or your YouTube channels.

00:23:21.601 --> 00:23:24.920
Anything that is a good way to
keep in touch would be awesome.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.130
BRITTANY DKE: Well,
you guys can follow me

00:23:27.130 --> 00:23:29.170
on Instagram, @britxbrat2.

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:32.060
[LAUGHS] britxbrat2
I think is on the--

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.685
JON YOUSHAEI: Oh,
and it's all on the--

00:23:33.685 --> 00:23:35.560
BRITTANY DKE: Yeah,
it's all on there.

00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.820
And also I host workshops
and classes at YouTube

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.840
once a month.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.461
So you guys can check that
out on YouTube Space website.

00:23:45.461 --> 00:23:47.710
JON PHENOM: Can I share a
little bit on the last part?

00:23:47.710 --> 00:23:48.100
JON YOUSHAEI: Absolutely.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:48.715
Go ahead, Jon.

00:23:48.715 --> 00:23:49.465
JON PHENOM: Sorry.

00:23:49.465 --> 00:23:50.299
I just have to say--

00:23:50.299 --> 00:23:51.756
JON YOUSHAEI: No
need to apologize.

00:23:51.756 --> 00:23:52.420
JON PHENOM: OK.

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:55.480
For me-- OK, so let
me tell you all this.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.650
I have a fraction of the
number of subscribers

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:01.969
of these beautiful ladies
on the panel and, but--

00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:03.760
JON YOUSHAEI: And this
beautiful gentleman.

00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:04.426
JON PHENOM: Yes.

00:24:04.426 --> 00:24:06.130
But look out for the collab.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:09.250
They're all going to collab
with Jon Phenom at some point.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:10.480
Hope, right?

00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:13.700
But here's what I
want to say, is,

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:16.550
I was the guy where people
would say, oh, my friend designs

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:17.050
clothing.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:19.630
And so I'd get a random
call from so-and-so,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.910
and they'd be like, hey,
I'm so-and-so's friend

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:22.870
and I'm trying to
start a clothing line.

00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:24.049
And I'm like, oh, OK, cool.

00:24:24.049 --> 00:24:25.090
What do you need to know?

00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:26.770
So when I started
my YouTube channel,

00:24:26.770 --> 00:24:29.020
I just put up 20 videos
of what I would always

00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:31.660
tell people to do in
terms of starting a brand.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.767
And it was funny because
I was like, no one's ever

00:24:33.767 --> 00:24:34.600
going to watch this.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.870
I'd get like 100 views in
like a month or something.

00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:39.980
So but I would say, go
to this YouTube channel.

00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:42.160
And when I stepped away from
it for a while, it came back

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.701
and there was like
1,000 subscribers.

00:24:43.701 --> 00:24:45.850
So I saw people wanted
the information.

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.125
And so now I'll do
a lot of consulting,

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:49.750
and they'll come from
my base of people

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.590
looking for the information.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:54.220
So for me, that's where
something kind of clicked and I

00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:57.126
realized I could
actually offer value.

00:24:57.126 --> 00:24:58.750
But yeah, so I just
want to share that.

00:24:58.750 --> 00:25:01.600
And for me, if you
just google-- oh, wow.

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.410
I just said, if
you google @Google.

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:04.045
That is crazy.

00:25:04.045 --> 00:25:04.490
JON YOUSHAEI: Whoa, inception.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.820
JON PHENOM: What camera?

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.450
What camera?

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:06.241
JON YOUSHAEI: Whoa.

00:25:06.241 --> 00:25:07.450
JON PHENOM: That's crazy.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:09.000
That's crazy.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:09.500
You can--

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:10.210
JON YOUSHAEI: The black
hole is about to form.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:13.180
JON PHENOM: --google Jon
Phenom, and you'll find me.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:16.656
And then my YouTube
channel is /JonPhenom.

00:25:16.656 --> 00:25:18.030
AUDIENCE: Woo!

00:25:18.030 --> 00:25:20.099
[APPLAUSE]

00:25:20.099 --> 00:25:21.140
JON PHENOM: Thanks, Jack.

00:25:24.166 --> 00:25:26.416
JON YOUSHAEI: Any other
thoughts before we open it up,

00:25:26.416 --> 00:25:27.620
or things you guys want to say?

00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:28.670
DARREN MOULDEN: I think
I just want to leave you

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.620
guys with this last little bit.

00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:34.040
With social media, we
are watching each other

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.680
and oftentimes will start
to compare ourselves

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.590
to people that we see,
and they may inspire us.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.090
And we'll say, oh,
you know, like, I

00:25:41.090 --> 00:25:42.110
want to do what they do.

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:45.380
I want to be like them, but I
would never be able to do that.

00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.234
You have to always remember that
they had a story and they had--

00:25:49.234 --> 00:25:51.650
they were in the same position
that you were at one point.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:53.025
But they had to
make the decision

00:25:53.025 --> 00:25:56.240
and have courage enough to go
after what they wanted to do

00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:57.350
and believe in themselves.

00:25:57.350 --> 00:25:58.850
So a lot of times
with social media,

00:25:58.850 --> 00:26:01.340
you have to shut
it off in a sense

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:04.490
that you have to look at
yourself as an individual

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:08.150
and know that you are
fully capable of doing

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.860
what they had to do.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.020
It's not going to be easy.

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.710
It wasn't easy for them.

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:14.750
They had probably
many sleepless nights

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:16.850
and probably wanted to give up.

00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:20.150
But you always have to be
persistent and always know

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.160
that you can do whatever
it is that you want to do.

00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.920
And also note,
social media people

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.470
are only putting there
what they want to show you.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:29.390
They're not showing
you the back end of it.

00:26:29.390 --> 00:26:33.020
They're not showing you the late
nights when you're up at 5:00

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.760
in the morning
sewing, or like when

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.740
you're editing your videos.

00:26:36.740 --> 00:26:39.680
So you don't see that, but
you see that amazing picture

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.090
or that amazing video.

00:26:41.090 --> 00:26:44.630
There's always work, hard
work that's behind that.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.897
It's never easy,
but you can do it.

00:26:46.897 --> 00:26:48.388
JON YOUSHAEI: Beautifully said.

00:26:48.388 --> 00:26:51.370
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.430
Any other thoughts, guys?

00:26:55.430 --> 00:26:57.500
Some serious wisdom
being dropped right now.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.875
DARREN MOULDEN:
Oh, and follow me

00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:02.620

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.042
And darrenwearsitwell.com
my blog, so make sure

00:27:05.042 --> 00:27:05.750
you check me out.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:06.410
JON YOUSHAEI: Boom.

00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:06.980
Nice.

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:07.580
Nice.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:10.330
Any other thoughts
before we open it up?

00:27:10.330 --> 00:27:13.670
CLOE FELDMAN: I'll
plug my socials.

00:27:13.670 --> 00:27:17.000
Yeah, so my Twitter, Instagram,
everything's @cloecouture.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.320
And then I started a clothing
line last year called GLO

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.650
by Cloe Couture.

00:27:21.650 --> 00:27:23.900
So that's all on
cloecouture.com,

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:26.030
if you guys want
to check that out.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:26.870
JON YOUSHAEI: Cool.

00:27:26.870 --> 00:27:27.710
Awesome, awesome.

00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:30.927
I think we have a box to
pass around for questions.

00:27:30.927 --> 00:27:31.760
CREW: Two questions.

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:33.232
JON YOUSHAEI: We
got two questions.

00:27:33.232 --> 00:27:35.690
Maybe we will do it one from
this side, one from that side.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:36.190
Yep.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:39.867
Do you want to stand up, say
your name, introduce yourself?

00:27:39.867 --> 00:27:40.950
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm Kalilah.

00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.060
I'm from GALA--

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.340
Girls Academic
Leadership Academy.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:45.341
JON YOUSHAEI: All right.

00:27:45.341 --> 00:27:47.381
Give it up for her for
asking the first question.

00:27:47.381 --> 00:27:48.110
That's amazing.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:50.410
[APPLAUSE]

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:53.460
That takes courage.

00:27:53.460 --> 00:27:57.450
AUDIENCE: And I just
had a question, like,

00:27:57.450 --> 00:27:59.700
what would you say your
main focus was when you

00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.452
were going towards your goal?

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:03.660
JON YOUSHAEI: Great question.

00:28:06.999 --> 00:28:09.790
BRITTANY DKE: I've got
to think about that one.

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:11.560
JON PHENOM: So for
me, obviously I

00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:14.270
met this guy, Ali Ashar,
who was a designer.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.960
So I would write it everywhere.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.930
I would just tell everybody
or put out in the atmosphere

00:28:19.930 --> 00:28:21.190
that I am a designer.

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:23.270
So I was on my way to
becoming a designer

00:28:23.270 --> 00:28:24.760
and I was real serious about it.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:27.737
I didn't breathe until I
became an apparel designer.

00:28:27.737 --> 00:28:29.320
Then after that, it
was other things--

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320
creative director and all
of that sort of thing.

00:28:34.466 --> 00:28:36.956
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:39.905
ALE LA CHULA: My main focus--

00:28:39.905 --> 00:28:43.290
well, when I started YouTube, my
main focus was always business.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:47.070
I always knew that I wanted
to have my own business.

00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:50.694
So I always made sure to keep
that in mind in whatever I did.

00:28:50.694 --> 00:28:52.110
So I was always
figuring out a way

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:55.230
how I can leverage
what I had and actually

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:56.400
turn it into a business.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.463
So always owning my own
company was my goal.

00:28:59.463 --> 00:29:00.449
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:02.910
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:03.410 --> 00:29:05.090
CLOE FELDMAN: I think
for me, something

00:29:05.090 --> 00:29:07.430
that's always been my focus
and always will be my focus

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.771
is getting better.

00:29:08.771 --> 00:29:11.270
And that's like, at first it
was getting better with makeup,

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.700
and then getting better
with my video quality,

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:15.710
and now it's just getting
better as a person

00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.470
and learning how to
convey that and spread

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:20.080
the message to you guys.

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.020
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:23.840
[APPLAUSE]

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.730
DARREN MOULDEN: I
think a lot of times

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:29.470
when we start out with the goal,
we think of the end result.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:33.080
And you have to use that
as fuel to get you there.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.450
Because there's the
hard work in between,

00:29:35.450 --> 00:29:39.530
but also remember the shining
moment that you see yourself in

00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:42.290
or whatever it is that that
goal is at the end, how you see

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.740
yourself, remember that
and use that as ammo

00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:49.309
to just really work
hard and go after it.

00:29:49.309 --> 00:29:50.600
JON YOUSHAEI: Yeah, absolutely.

00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.141
And there's actually
a lot of studies

00:29:52.141 --> 00:29:55.040
that show if you visualized
yourself attaining a goal,

00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:56.970
you're much more
likely to get it.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:59.495
So if you begin with the end
in mind, you'll be ahead.

00:29:59.495 --> 00:30:00.286
BRITTANY DKE: Yeah.

00:30:00.286 --> 00:30:03.150
And for me, when
I started YouTube,

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:08.360
it was definitely also
to be a better designer.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.790
I was actually going to
school for fashion design,

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.830
but I felt like I
wasn't learning enough.

00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:15.320
So that's when I kind of
took a break from school

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.640
and just started teaching
myself techniques.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.810
And then that's when
I brung it to YouTube.

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:24.350
And so, yeah, YouTube is
all about me teaching people

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:25.940
from all over the world.

00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.940
And I know a lot of you
guys are in high school,

00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:30.930
so I know prom season will
be coming up for you guys.

00:30:30.930 --> 00:30:33.269
So if you want to learn how
to make-- yes, right there.

00:30:33.269 --> 00:30:35.560
If you're gonna learn how to
make your own prom dress--

00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.210
and guys, I have clothes
for you guys, too--

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:41.070
my channel, I'm just saying.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.270
JON YOUSHAEI: I love it.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:44.720
Any other thoughts before
we go to the next question?

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.360
CLOE FELDMAN: I agree a lot
on the visualizing thing.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:50.150
I have always visualized
every single goal

00:30:50.150 --> 00:30:52.126
through this entire process.

00:30:52.126 --> 00:30:53.750
My first thing was
that I really wanted

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:55.730
to get to 100
subscribers and everyone

00:30:55.730 --> 00:30:58.320
doubted me and laughed at me and
said I wasn't going to do it.

00:30:58.320 --> 00:30:59.736
But I knew in the
back of my head,

00:30:59.736 --> 00:31:02.720
like I just was picturing
myself with the 100 subscribers.

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.190
I already went out and bought--

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.398
I was going to do a giveaway.

00:31:05.398 --> 00:31:07.160
I bought it before
I even got them.

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:10.130
So just really putting
yourself in that place

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.570
and acting like you already
have it is a big key to success.

00:31:14.570 --> 00:31:15.830
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:31:15.830 --> 00:31:17.490
Great advice.

00:31:17.490 --> 00:31:18.560
Thanks for your question.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:21.298
We'll do one more.

00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:22.262
CREW: Oh, right here.

00:31:22.262 --> 00:31:22.890
Good morning.

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:23.580
Oh!

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.621
JON YOUSHAEI: Here we go.

00:31:24.621 --> 00:31:25.127
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:25.127 --> 00:31:26.960
Do you want to stand
up, introduce yourself?

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.501
Give it up for her
to ask a question.

00:31:28.501 --> 00:31:30.740
[CHEERING]

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.122
Way to go.

00:31:33.122 --> 00:31:33.830
What's your name?

00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:35.040
What's your question?

00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:37.640
AUDIENCE: My name is Honey
Tokyo [? Mashashige. ?]

00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.180
I'm from Alliance
Bloomfield high school.

00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.910
And my question is,
what really inspires

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:46.100
you to do this for you?

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.657
JON YOUSHAEI: Ooh,
great question.

00:31:48.657 --> 00:31:50.740
DARREN MOULDEN: Sometimes
it's when you figure out

00:31:50.740 --> 00:31:55.420
what you don't want to do
that will lead you to what

00:31:55.420 --> 00:31:56.810
it is that you do want to do.

00:31:56.810 --> 00:32:02.080
So for me, graduating
and becoming a pharmacist

00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.220
and then at work I was bored.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:08.440
I was like, this is boring.

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:10.360
You know, it's good
money but it's boring.

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:14.500
So sometimes it's what
you don't want to do.

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.740
When you're in that place where,
OK, I don't want to be here,

00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.400
that's what drives you
or gives you the idea

00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.750
or stirs you up
enough to say, OK,

00:32:23.750 --> 00:32:25.490
what is it that I do want to do?

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.640
JON YOUSHAEI: That's amazing.

00:32:27.640 --> 00:32:30.540
All high school students
should hear what you just said.

00:32:30.540 --> 00:32:31.270
That's amazing.

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:32.039
That's so true.

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:33.830
What do you guys think
about that question?

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.600
What inspires you?

00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:37.010
What's your why?

00:32:37.010 --> 00:32:39.670
BRITTANY DKE: Well for me,
like I said before, I always

00:32:39.670 --> 00:32:41.800
had a passion for fashion.

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.870
I definitely feel like
if you put anything out

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:46.360
on social media,
definitely do something

00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.150
that you enjoy and don't
do it because it's trending

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:51.670
or is the next popular thing.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:55.210
But I just really
enjoy doing what I do.

00:32:55.210 --> 00:32:57.850
It's like just
waking up every day,

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:00.280
sewing, making
videos for YouTube

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.610
and seeing all the work that
people send to me from all

00:33:03.610 --> 00:33:05.210
over the world is just--

00:33:05.210 --> 00:33:05.970
I really enjoy it.

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:06.886
JON YOUSHAEI: Amazing.

00:33:06.886 --> 00:33:07.746
BRITTANY DKE: Yeah.

00:33:07.746 --> 00:33:10.120
JON PHENOM: What I want to
say for you guys individually,

00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:11.610
when you guys are
thinking-- because everybody

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:13.820
is thinking about, how
does this apply to me?

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.460
So once you guys go
on your journey--

00:33:15.460 --> 00:33:17.085
and it doesn't matter
what age you are.

00:33:17.085 --> 00:33:19.990
Like I had a friend tell
me the other day, he's 35

00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:22.480
and he's like, I hate my
job, I don't want to do this.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:23.362
Help me, Jon.

00:33:23.362 --> 00:33:24.820
So it's the same
thing that I would

00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:26.800
tell like a 16-year-old kid.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.570
You have to get
familiar with the things

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:31.750
that you love and don't love,
just like you were saying.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.550
And then when you
get on your journey,

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.670
you might go into one
job and figure out,

00:33:36.670 --> 00:33:38.110
wow, I don't like
this or I don't

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.616
like this situation, maybe if
you pivot it and change it.

00:33:41.616 --> 00:33:43.240
There's another thing
that you'll love.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:45.520
That's why I've tried so
many different things, like I

00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:47.110
probably have 10
versions of my resume

00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:50.030
but it all kind of
culminates with fashion.

00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:52.480
And another thing that
I'll always tell people

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.390
is, when you do find
what you want to do,

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:59.470
find the best mentor
possible who's doing it, OK?

00:33:59.470 --> 00:34:01.960
Like there's a reason
why someone is first

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:07.010
in their field and someone is
226th at the same industry,

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:08.380
the same job.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.090
Right?

00:34:09.090 --> 00:34:13.690
Like I would pay money to intern
with someone who's number one.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:15.909
Or maybe they have a
huge ego and I don't like

00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:17.520
that so I go with number six.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:19.030
Do you see what I'm saying?

00:34:19.030 --> 00:34:21.321
Because at the end of the
day, I don't want compromise.

00:34:21.321 --> 00:34:24.290
You know, I don't want a "Devil
Wears Prada" situation with me.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:26.908
Because that movie wouldn't
end like that for me.

00:34:26.908 --> 00:34:27.699
Where's the camera?

00:34:27.699 --> 00:34:29.010
For real.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:30.429
It wouldn't end like that.

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:31.540
I'm Filipino for real.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:37.480
So what I'm saying same for you
guys is find that best mentor,

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:41.920
learn everything you can from
them because their psychology

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.690
is different.

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:45.190
When they wake up and-- when
she's doing her YouTube video--

00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.260
she has 3.2 million, y'all.

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.730
3.2 million subs.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.090
Don't sleep on it.

00:34:50.090 --> 00:34:52.600
So when she wakes
up in the morning,

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.030
her psychology is
different than someone who

00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:56.920
has way less subs than that.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.350
The designer, architect,
whatever it is you

00:34:59.350 --> 00:35:01.950
guys-- realtor, whatever
you guys want to be,

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:03.860
there's someone who
has a psychology.

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.680
And success leaves clues.

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.500
So if you grab some
of those clues,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:13.420
it will expedite your career by
decades and by money, y'all--

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:15.500
tons of money.

00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.110
And that's not necessarily
the push for it.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:18.610
OK?

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.760
It's about being happy
with your life, all right?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.290
Because studies show
at about 80, 90 grand,

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:25.554
you can kind of get everything
you want in your life.

00:35:25.554 --> 00:35:26.470
So you guys are young.

00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:27.710
You'll be like, I
want to be rich!

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:28.780
I want to be a baller!

00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.490
You know?

00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:31.630
But in time you'll see.

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:33.820
But it's about finding
a mentor and then

00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.610
getting the clues
of success from them

00:35:36.610 --> 00:35:39.420
to really drive your career up.

00:35:39.420 --> 00:35:40.400
JON YOUSHAEI: Great.

00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.108
I think we're going
to start wrapping up,

00:35:42.108 --> 00:35:45.010
unless you guys have any
quick thoughts to drop in.

00:35:45.010 --> 00:35:47.490
Any quick thoughts
before we wrap up?

00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:48.470
Cool.

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.130
I want to say thanks
so much for coming out.

00:35:51.130 --> 00:35:52.934
The ending note, I want
to say, this is not

00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:54.100
the end of the conversation.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:55.600
It's very much the beginning.

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.480
Look us up on your program,
add us on social media,

00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:00.730
come up to us after this event.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:01.717
We want to talk to you.

00:36:01.717 --> 00:36:02.550
We want to help you.

00:36:02.550 --> 00:36:03.670
We want to pay it forward.

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:06.310
I want to give it up one more
time for our amazing panelists.

00:36:06.310 --> 00:36:09.360
