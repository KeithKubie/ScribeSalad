00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.950
The maximum value of the
expression 1 over sine squared

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.400
of theta plus 3
sine theta cosine

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.710
theta plus 5 cosine
squared of theta is?

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:13.920
So let's rewrite this.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.610
So this is 1 over, so I have
a sine squared of theta.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.970
And then, at least
in my brain, whenever

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.595
I see a sine squared
of theta, I always

00:00:25.595 --> 00:00:27.520
look for a cosine
squared of theta.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.240
Because I know that when I take
the sum of them it equals 1.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870
And I don't have just one
cosine squared theta here,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.070
I have five cosine
squared theta.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.800
So let me just take one of them.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.250
So I have a plus
cosine squared theta.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.010
And since I took one of them,
I only have four of these left.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.510
So plus 4 cosine squared theta.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:48.810
And then I have this stuff.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.480
Plus 3 sine of theta
cosine of theta.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.200
So what this first
step allowed me to do

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.230
is just turn these two
characters right over here,

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.220
sine squared theta
plus cosine squared

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.500
theta, that is equal to 1.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.100
So we've simplified it to 1
over 1 plus-- now let's think

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.340
about how we can write
cosine squared of theta.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.070
I'll write our identities here.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.370
Cosine squared of theta.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.390
And we've prove these in
the trigonometry playlist.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.530
This is equal to 1 plus cosine
of 2 theta all of that over 2.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.170
And my goal here is, I really
just want to get everything--

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.836
well, I really just
want to simplify it.

00:01:35.836 --> 00:01:37.080
And maybe we'll do calculus.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.706
We'll use a little calculus
to find the minimum value

00:01:39.706 --> 00:01:41.330
of the denominator,
which would give us

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.390
the maximum value
of the numerator.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.420
So let's see, cosine squared
of theta is equal to this.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.670
So 4 times this is just going
to be-- so 4 times this.

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.470
The 4 divided by 2 is 2.

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.040
So it's going to be 2
times this numerator.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.590
So it's going to be 2
plus 2 cosine of 2 theta.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.850
That's this term right here.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.730
And then this term
right over here,

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:08.190
we could use the trig identity.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.070
That sine of two theta
is equal to 2 sine

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.010
of theta cosine of theta.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.140
Or you divide both sides by
2, you get 1/2 sine of 2 theta

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.530
is equal to sine of
theta cosine of theta.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.850
So this right over here,
this part right over here

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.220
is going to be 1/2
sine of 2 theta.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.020
But we're multiplying it by 3.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.970
So it's going to be plus
3/2 sine of 2 theta.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.200
And let's see, this part
over here clearly simplifies.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.997
This is 3.

00:02:45.997 --> 00:02:47.080
So let me just rewrite it.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:53.940
This is 1 over 3 plus
2 cosine of 2 theta

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.340
plus 3/2 sine of 2 theta.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.589
And we're really just
looking for the minimum.

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.130
We're looking for the minimum
value of the denominator, which

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.671
would give us the same as the
maximum value of the numerator.

00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:09.190
It would just be 1 over
this minimum value.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.510
So let's see how low we can
get, assuming we're above 0.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.130
Let's see how low we can get
for this denominator right here.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.140
We're just going to look
for its minimum value.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.350
So one thing we can do,
just to simplify things,

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.430
the minimum value of this
is going to be the same.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.180
The min of this thing-- I
don't want to write it there

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.650
because it kind of
confuses the problem.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:39.270
The minimum value of 3 plus 2
cosine 2 theta plus 3/2 sine

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.880
of 2 theta is going to be the
same thing as the minimum value

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.670
of 3 plus-- I'm just going
to do the substitution

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:46.930
that 2 theta is equal to x.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.638
That just simplifies
things a little bit.

00:03:48.638 --> 00:03:49.870
You don't have to do that.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.370
But just to, so 3 plus 2
cosine of x plus 3/2 sine of x.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.027
So this is a pretty
simple expression.

00:04:00.027 --> 00:04:02.110
Let's see how we can figure
out its minimum value.

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.800
And my temptation is to take
the derivative, find out

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.990
where the derivative
is equal to 0,

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.730
and then that will either be
a maximum or a minimum point.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.090
So let's take the derivative.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.570
The derivative of
this expression

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.690
right over here
with respect to x.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.019
Well, derivative of 3
with respect to x is 0.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.990
Derivative of cosine of x
is negative 2 sine of x.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.160
Derivative of 3/2
sine of x is going

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.610
to be plus 3/2 cosine of x.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.447
And then, that is
going to be equal to 0.

00:04:32.447 --> 00:04:34.780
We want to find where the
slope is 0 because it's either

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:37.220
going to be a maximum
or minimum point.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.840
And let's see, we
can add, we could

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.530
add 2 sine of x to both sides.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:47.660
So we get 3/2 cosine of x
is equal to 2 sine of x.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:54.140
And then, we can divide both
sides of this equation by,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.430
let's divide it by 2 first.

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.929
I don't want to
skip too many steps.

00:04:56.929 --> 00:05:02.200
So 3/4 cosine of x is
equal to sine of x.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.830
Then we could divide both
sides by cosine of x.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:08.280
So we get 3 over
4 is equal to sine

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.440
of x over cosine of x, which is
the same thing as the tangent

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:14.260
of x.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.850
So an x value that gives us--
or the tangent of an x value

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.750
that gives us 3/4
is going to give us

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.020
either a maximum
or a minimum point.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.490
So let's think about this.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:25.990
Let's think about
this a little bit.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.120
Let me draw my unit circle.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.320
So let's think about
two x values that

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.880
will give us the tangent of 3/4.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.930
So let me draw my unit circle.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.680
That's a unit circle.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.613
Let me draw a unit.

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:45.820
This is always the hardest part.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.850
So let me draw this.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:51.000
All right, there
is my unit circle.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.606
So how can I get a triangle,
or, well, yeah, let's think

00:05:54.606 --> 00:05:55.230
about that way.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.950
How can I get a triangle where
an angle is the tangent of 3/4.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.681
Remember, tangent is
opposite over adjacent.

00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:02.180
Right?

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:04.290
Tangent is opposite
over adjacent.

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.960
So if this is my triangle
right over here, if this is x,

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.270
opposite over adjacent
is equal to 3/4.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.520
So opposite could be 3
and adjacent could be 4.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.472
And we hopefully
immediately recognize this.

00:06:19.472 --> 00:06:23.120
This is a 3, 4, 5 triangle
because it's a right triangle.

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:27.050
3 squared plus 4 squared
is 25 which is 5 squared.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.770
So this is a 3, 4, 5 triangle.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.490
Now, there's two tangent values.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.730
So x could be like this.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:37.610
So this obviously isn't a
unit hypotenuse over here.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.030
But we could divide everything
by 5, and it would be.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.460
So we could have this situation.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.800
We could have this
situation over here.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.870
Where this is x.

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.220
If this is the unit circle,
the hypotenuse is 1.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.880
This is 3/5 and this is 4/5.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.280
This would, tangent of x here,
tangent of x would give us 3/4.

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.250
But is this going to give us a
maximum value or minimum value?

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:04.800
Well over here, both
cosine of x and sine of x

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.040
are going to be positive.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.670
So both of these are going
to be positive values.

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.870
So it's going to, probably,
maximize this expression

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:13.790
over here.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.460
Now the other x that gives us
the same tangent, and remember,

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:21.330
the tangent is really just the
slope of the radius in the unit

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:24.350
circle, would be this angle.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:27.750
This has the same tangent value.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:32.690
So this x over here.

00:07:32.690 --> 00:07:37.210
In this case, the tangent
is still going to be 3/4.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:40.500
But over here, the sine
and cosine are negative.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:45.930
So over here, the
x-coordinate, or the cosine,

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.360
is going to be negative 4/5.

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:51.340
And the sine value,
or the y value,

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.390
is going to be negative 3/5.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:58.250
And this will give
us a minimum point,

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:02.480
because here both the sine
and the cosine are negative.

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.460
So let's use this
x right over here.

00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.000
And notice, we don't even have
to figure out what the x is.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.950
Because we know that if the
tangent over here is 4/5,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.290
either both the sine
is going to be 3/5,

00:08:16.290 --> 00:08:18.262
and the cosine is
going to be 4/5,

00:08:18.262 --> 00:08:19.720
which will give us
a maximum point.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.620
Or the tangent could be 3/4.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.700
And then the sine
will be negative 3/5,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.672
and the cosine will
be negative 4/5.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:27.880
So let's use these over here.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.670
So the minimum is
going to be equal to 3

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.758
plus 2 times cosine of x.

00:08:33.758 --> 00:08:35.049
We're using this one over here.

00:08:35.049 --> 00:08:36.370
So 2 times cosine of x.

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.785
Cosine of x here
is negative 4/5.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.130
And then plus 3/2
times the sine of x.

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:48.900
Sine of x here is negative 3/5.

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:54.690
And what is this
going to be equal to?

00:08:54.690 --> 00:09:01.530
This is going to be equal to 3
plus, this is negative 8/5, 3,

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:09.540
maybe I should write 3
minus 8/5 minus 9/10.

00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:11.900
And so this is going
to be equal to-- we

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:18.390
could put everything over 10
--30 over 10 minus 16 over 10,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:19.720
that's 8/5.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.630
Minus 9/10.

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.180
And this gives us what?

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.970
This gives us 5/10.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:29.080
5/10 or 1/2.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.060
So the minimum value for
our denominator-- everything

00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.750
we've been dealing with so
far has been our denominator--

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.090
the minimum value of all
of this business over here,

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.980
the minimum value is 1/2.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.470
So the maximum value, that
this whole expression takes,

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.170
is when the minimum
value is 1/2.

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:52.410
So we get 1 over 1/2
half which is equal to 2.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.250
And we're done.
