00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
- [Instructor] In a previous
video, we explored the graphs

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.880
of Y equals one over X
squared and one over X.

00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.980
In a previous video we've
looked at these graphs.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.350
This is Y is equal to one over X squared.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.840
This is Y is equal to one over X.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.700
And we explored what's the limit

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.850
as X approaches zero in
either of those scenarios.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:15.820
And in this left scenario we saw

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.340
as X becomes less and less negative,

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.916
as it approaches zero
from the left hand side,

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.180
the value of one over
X squared is unbounded

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.560
in the positive direction.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.930
And the same thing happens as
we approach X from the right,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.530
as we become less and less positive

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.170
but we are still positive,

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990
the value of one over X squared becomes

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:38.010
unbounded in the positive direction.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.727
So in that video, we just said, "Hey,

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:43.150
"one could say that this
limit is unbounded."

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.270
But what we're going
to do in this video is

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.410
introduce new notation.

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.150
Instead of just saying it's unbounded,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.160
we could say, "Hey, from
both the left and the right

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.590
it looks like we're going
to positive infinity".

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.697
So we can introduce
this notation of saying,

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.320
"Hey, this is going to infinity",

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.240
which you will sometimes see used.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.700
Some people would call this unbounded,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.160
some people say it does not exist

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.730
because it's not approaching
some finite value,

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.630
while some people will use this notation

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.220
of the limit going to infinity.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.760
But what about this scenario?

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.220
Can we use our new notation here?

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.310
Well, when we approach zero from the left,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.120
it looks like we're unbounded
in the negative direction,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.310
and when we approach zero from the right,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.260
we are unbounded in
the positive direction.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.760
So, here you still could not say

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.710
that the limit is approaching infinity

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.440
because from the right
it's approaching infinity,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.660
but from the left it's
approaching negative infinity.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.660
So you would still say
that this does not exist.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.340
You could do one sided limits here,

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.670
which if you're not familiar with,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.780
I encourage you to review
it on Khan Academy.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.010
If you said the limit of one over X

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.340
as X approaches zero
from the left hand side,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.810
from values less than zero,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.627
well then you would look at
this right over here and say,

00:01:57.627 --> 00:01:59.544
"Well, look, it looks like we're going

00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:00.790
unbounded in the negative direction".

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.270
So you would say this is
equal to negative infinity.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.270
And of course if you said the
limit as X approaches zero

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.700
from the right of one over X, well here

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.500
you're unbounded in the positive direction

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.650
so that's going to be
equal to positive infinity.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.760
Let's do an example
problem from Khan Academy

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.493
based on this idea and this notation.

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.540
So here it says, consider
graphs A, B, and C.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.470
The dashed lines represent asymptotes.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.260
Which of the graphs agree
with this statement,

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.160
that the limit as X approaches 1 of H of X

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.480
is equal to infinity?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.980
Pause this video and see
if you can figure it out.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.350
Alright, let's go through each of these.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.850
So we want to think about
what happens at X equals one.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.860
So that's right over here on graph A.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.880
So as we approach X equals one,

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.120
so let me write this, so the limit,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.860
let me do this for the different graphs.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.753
So, for graph A, the
limit as x approaches one

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.360
from the left, that looks like

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.160
it's unbounded in the positive direction.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.091
That equals infinity and the limit

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.530
as X approaches one from the right,

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.020
well that looks like it's
going to negative infinity.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.970
That equals negative infinity.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.770
And since these are going
in two different directions,

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.860
you wouldn't be able to say that

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.420
the limit as X approaches one

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.450
from both directions is equal to infinity.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.700
So I would rule this one out.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.710
Now let's look at choice B.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.710
What's the limit as X
approaches one from the left?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.250
And of course these are of H of X.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.610
Gotta write that down.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.970
So, of H of X right over here.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.589
Well, as we approach from the left,

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:47.390
looks like we're going
to positive infinity.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.740
And it looks like the limit of H of X

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.220
as we approach one from the right is

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.860
also going to positive infinity.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.710
And so, since we're
approaching you could say

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.630
the same direction of infinity,
you could say this for B.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.490
So B meets the constraints, but

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.730
let's just check C to make sure.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.890
Well, you can see very
clearly X equals one,

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:11.230
that as we approach it from the left,

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:12.490
we go to negative infinity,

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.712
and as we approach from the right,

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:15.545
we got to positive infinity.

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:18.740
So this, once again,
would not be approaching

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.880
the same infinity.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.293
So you would rule this one out, as well.
