good afternoon so we'll try and get to

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929
good afternoon so we'll try and get to
 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.790
good afternoon so we'll try and get to
the exams Wednesday esters working on

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
the exams Wednesday esters working on
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.220
the exams Wednesday esters working on
them so we have one more exam final exam

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230
them so we have one more exam final exam
 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.060
them so we have one more exam final exam
it is cumulative but it's going to focus

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070
it is cumulative but it's going to focus
 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.269
it is cumulative but it's going to focus
on material from now on and I will give

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279
on material from now on and I will give
 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.779
on material from now on and I will give
you review questions that will tell you

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789
you review questions that will tell you
 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.120
you review questions that will tell you
basically what will be on it so

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130
basically what will be on it so
 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.350
basically what will be on it so
everything I asked you on the previous

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360
everything I asked you on the previous
 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.740
everything I asked you on the previous
exam was in the review questions so the

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750
exam was in the review questions so the
 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.119
exam was in the review questions so the
same thing will happen with the final

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
same thing will happen with the final
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.000
same thing will happen with the final
okay so I will for the earlier lectures

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010
okay so I will for the earlier lectures
 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.709
okay so I will for the earlier lectures
will give you review questions and focus

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719
will give you review questions and focus
 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.950
will give you review questions and focus
on what we want you to remember keep up

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
on what we want you to remember keep up
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.270
on what we want you to remember keep up
with the quizzes there will still be a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
with the quizzes there will still be a
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.389
with the quizzes there will still be a
quiz every week because if you're if the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399
quiz every week because if you're if the
 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.160
quiz every week because if you're if the
course is over and you haven't done it

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
course is over and you haven't done it
 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.700
course is over and you haven't done it
I can't reopen it for you okay so try

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710
I can't reopen it for you okay so try
 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310
I can't reopen it for you okay so try
and keep up with them there will be one

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320
and keep up with them there will be one
 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.160
and keep up with them there will be one
extra credit opportunity for ten points

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170
extra credit opportunity for ten points
 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.560
extra credit opportunity for ten points
so you can add to your grade that way

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
so you can add to your grade that way
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.390
so you can add to your grade that way
though that'll be up in about a week or

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
though that'll be up in about a week or
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.899
though that'll be up in about a week or
two okay now today we're going to today

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909
two okay now today we're going to today
 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:12.859
two okay now today we're going to today
in the next time we're going to talk

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869
in the next time we're going to talk
 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.570
in the next time we're going to talk
about two different patterns of

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580
about two different patterns of
 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.380
about two different patterns of
infection

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390
infection
 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350
infection
today is acute and it's actually

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360
today is acute and it's actually
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.990
today is acute and it's actually
appropriate that I'm doing the acute and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
appropriate that I'm doing the acute and
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060
appropriate that I'm doing the acute and
dr. Silverstein is doing the persistent

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070
dr. Silverstein is doing the persistent
 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.350
dr. Silverstein is doing the persistent
infections because he is persistent and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360
 
 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.840
 
what is an acute infection did you burn

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850
what is an acute infection did you burn
 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.319
what is an acute infection did you burn
out my batteries here

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
 
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.279
 
no it was the microphone well I can do

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289
no it was the microphone well I can do
 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:48.270
no it was the microphone well I can do
it by hand okay this all has to do with

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280
it by hand okay this all has to do with
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.029
it by hand okay this all has to do with
that the pattern of infection that a

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039
that the pattern of infection that a
 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:53.010
that the pattern of infection that a
virus undergoes so you remember from

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020
virus undergoes so you remember from
 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.709
virus undergoes so you remember from
what we've talked about already there

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:55.719
what we've talked about already there
 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:58.380
what we've talked about already there
are some viruses where if you infect the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390
are some viruses where if you infect the
 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.660
are some viruses where if you infect the
cell they will kill the cell the it will

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670
cell they will kill the cell the it will
 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.160
cell they will kill the cell the it will
make a lot of viruses we call those

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
make a lot of viruses we call those
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.410
make a lot of viruses we call those
cytopathic viruses it's quite clear

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420
cytopathic viruses it's quite clear
 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.559
cytopathic viruses it's quite clear
there are also some infections where

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569
there are also some infections where
 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:10.499
there are also some infections where
there are virus produced but virus but

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509
there are virus produced but virus but
 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.900
there are virus produced but virus but
the cells are not killed nonce the so

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910
the cells are not killed nonce the so
 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.690
the cells are not killed nonce the so
called non psychopathic infections and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700
called non psychopathic infections and
 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.240
called non psychopathic infections and
we talked about how in the host in these

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250
we talked about how in the host in these
 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.890
we talked about how in the host in these
kinds of infections that disease is

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900
kinds of infections that disease is
 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.979
kinds of infections that disease is
largely immuno pathological

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989
largely immuno pathological
 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.170
largely immuno pathological
there are also some infections I don't

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180
there are also some infections I don't
 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.520
there are also some infections I don't
think we've really talked about this

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530
think we've really talked about this
 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.410
think we've really talked about this
which neither killed the cell nor

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420
which neither killed the cell nor
 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.660
which neither killed the cell nor
produced progeny although you could have

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670
produced progeny although you could have
 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.580
produced progeny although you could have
you could view a retrovirus infection as

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590
you could view a retrovirus infection as
 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.650
you could view a retrovirus infection as
doing that the retrovirus getting into a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660
doing that the retrovirus getting into a
 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.720
doing that the retrovirus getting into a
cell integrating and not producing any

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730
cell integrating and not producing any
 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.630
cell integrating and not producing any
variants so these kinds of patterns of

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640
variants so these kinds of patterns of
 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.990
variants so these kinds of patterns of
infections lytic or non lytic or the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000
infections lytic or non lytic or the
 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.970
infections lytic or non lytic or the
combination of the two together with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980
combination of the two together with
 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.849
combination of the two together with
what your host does determines what kind

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:47.859
what your host does determines what kind
 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:49.289
what your host does determines what kind
of infection you're going to have or the

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:49.299
of infection you're going to have or the
 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.819
of infection you're going to have or the
pattern of infection so that's what

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:50.829
pattern of infection so that's what
 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:52.199
pattern of infection so that's what
we're talking about whether it's a cute

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209
we're talking about whether it's a cute
 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.270
we're talking about whether it's a cute
or persistent it's a function of what

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280
or persistent it's a function of what
 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.430
or persistent it's a function of what
the virus does and how the host responds

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440
the virus does and how the host responds
 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.620
the virus does and how the host responds
and here is a graph which I believe you

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630
and here is a graph which I believe you
 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.789
and here is a graph which I believe you
have already seen which illustrates in a

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799
have already seen which illustrates in a
 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.920
have already seen which illustrates in a
graph format what we're talking about

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930
graph format what we're talking about
 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.080
graph format what we're talking about
here on the top is an acute infection

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
here on the top is an acute infection
 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.110
here on the top is an acute infection
and the information here in the blue

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120
and the information here in the blue
 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.000
and the information here in the blue
line is the amount of virus produced

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010
line is the amount of virus produced
 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.490
line is the amount of virus produced
with time so virus production with time

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500
with time so virus production with time
 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.370
with time so virus production with time
and then the red area is the amount of

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380
and then the red area is the amount of
 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.520
and then the red area is the amount of
disease produced in the host so an acute

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530
disease produced in the host so an acute
 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.920
disease produced in the host so an acute
infection you have a burst of virus

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930
infection you have a burst of virus
 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.960
infection you have a burst of virus
production accompanied by disease and

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970
production accompanied by disease and
 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.659
production accompanied by disease and
then the vite the infection is over it's

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669
then the vite the infection is over it's
 

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:30.500
then the vite the infection is over it's
a relatively rapid course of events and

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510
a relatively rapid course of events and
 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.789
a relatively rapid course of events and
typical acute infections are caused by

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799
typical acute infections are caused by
 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.839
typical acute infections are caused by
rhinoviruses common cold viruses

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849
rhinoviruses common cold viruses
 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.640
rhinoviruses common cold viruses
rotaviruses which we will talk about

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650
rotaviruses which we will talk about
 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.460
rotaviruses which we will talk about
today and influenza viruses so this is

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470
today and influenza viruses so this is
 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.170
today and influenza viruses so this is
what we'll talk about today and dr.

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180
what we'll talk about today and dr.
 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.640
what we'll talk about today and dr.
Silverstein next time we'll talk about

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
Silverstein next time we'll talk about
 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.409
Silverstein next time we'll talk about
these various kinds of persistent

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419
these various kinds of persistent
 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:48.569
these various kinds of persistent
infections which basically just go on

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579
infections which basically just go on
 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:51.210
infections which basically just go on
for a long period of time and you can

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220
for a long period of time and you can
 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.420
for a long period of time and you can
have virus produced for

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430
have virus produced for
 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.000
have virus produced for
long time as in here the lymphocytic

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010
long time as in here the lymphocytic
 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.190
long time as in here the lymphocytic
Korea meningitis virus eventually

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200
Korea meningitis virus eventually
 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.610
Korea meningitis virus eventually
there's disease and death herpes viruses

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620
there's disease and death herpes viruses
 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:03.130
there's disease and death herpes viruses
you have repeated bouts of production of

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140
you have repeated bouts of production of
 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.550
you have repeated bouts of production of
virus either with or without disease and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560
virus either with or without disease and
 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.640
virus either with or without disease and
then long infections where there's

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
then long infections where there's
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.580
then long infections where there's
initially virus and disease produced and

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590
initially virus and disease produced and
 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.860
initially virus and disease produced and
then a smoldering period eventually

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870
then a smoldering period eventually
 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:16.180
then a smoldering period eventually
leading to death and this is

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190
leading to death and this is
 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.879

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.960
are relatively brief everything is
relative of course but in terms of a

this is much shorter in a healthy host

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
this is much shorter in a healthy host
 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.790
this is much shorter in a healthy host
within days the viruses are eliminated

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800
 
 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.670
 
and usually you get one infection so you

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680
and usually you get one infection so you
 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.890
and usually you get one infection so you
can make vaccines against these viruses

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900
can make vaccines against these viruses
 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.390

on how many serotypes you are and some
 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.379
on how many serotypes you are and some
viruses utilize this to get around the

viruses utilize this to get around the
 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:54.249
viruses utilize this to get around the
immune response so some infections can

eventually if you are lucky the adaptive

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000
eventually if you are lucky the adaptive
 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.330
eventually if you are lucky the adaptive
response kicks and of course there's a

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:22.340
response kicks and of course there's a
 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.850
response kicks and of course there's a
10 to 14 day delay before you have a

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860
10 to 14 day delay before you have a

10 to 14 day delay before you have a
good adaptive response made virus levels

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:27.590
good adaptive response made virus levels
 

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:30.730
good adaptive response made virus levels
will decline and eventually the virus is

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:30.740
will decline and eventually the virus is
 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.830
will decline and eventually the virus is
cleared so there are two outcomes with

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840
cleared so there are two outcomes with
 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.210
cleared so there are two outcomes with
an acute infection you clear the

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220
an acute infection you clear the
 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.580
an acute infection you clear the
infection or you die that's really it

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:36.590
infection or you die that's really it
 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:39.670
infection or you die that's really it
and so if you're if you're unlucky the

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680
and so if you're if you're unlucky the
 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.620
and so if you're if you're unlucky the
latter occurs and then of course you

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630
latter occurs and then of course you
 

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.390
latter occurs and then of course you
have memory your immune response

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400
have memory your immune response
 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.730
have memory your immune response
remembers the pathogen the antigenic

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:45.740
remembers the pathogen the antigenic
 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.950
remembers the pathogen the antigenic
pattern of the pathogen so if you re

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960
pattern of the pathogen so if you re
 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.600
pattern of the pathogen so if you re
infected with a similar virus you will

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610
infected with a similar virus you will
 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.520
infected with a similar virus you will
be protected because the adaptive

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530
be protected because the adaptive
 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.540
be protected because the adaptive
response will be much more rapid with

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550
response will be much more rapid with
 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.090
response will be much more rapid with
all infections there is what we call an

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100
all infections there is what we call an
 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.460
all infections there is what we call an
incubation period that's the initial

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470
incubation period that's the initial
 

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.659

and that time viral genomes are
 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.730
and that time viral genomes are
replicating so the virus has entered you

these are all global effects caused by
an acute virus infection and that's the

short incubation period it usually means

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.450
short incubation period it usually means
 

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.840
short incubation period it usually means
that the virus infects locally and all

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:37.850
that the virus infects locally and all

the disease is produced by replication

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.010
the disease is produced by replication
 

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.220
the disease is produced by replication
there so a respiratory virus like flu

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:42.230
there so a respiratory virus like flu
 

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.230

nose where the symptoms are produced so

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:45.920
nose where the symptoms are produced so
 

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.620
nose where the symptoms are produced so
it's the virus doesn't have to go far to

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:47.630
it's the virus doesn't have to go far to
 

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.390
it's the virus doesn't have to go far to
cause the symptoms so the incubation

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:49.400
cause the symptoms so the incubation
 

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.260
cause the symptoms so the incubation
period sure pretty straightforward

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:52.270
period sure pretty straightforward
 

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.390
period sure pretty straightforward
influenza as an example long incubation

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:55.400
influenza as an example long incubation
 

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.260
influenza as an example long incubation
periods I mean that the virus needs to

00:08:59.260 --> 00:08:59.270
periods I mean that the virus needs to
 

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:01.000
periods I mean that the virus needs to
go somewhere else to cause disease and

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.010
go somewhere else to cause disease and
 

00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:02.440
go somewhere else to cause disease and
it takes time to get there and it may

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.450
it takes time to get there and it may
 

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.420
it takes time to get there and it may
also be that there are host responses

00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:04.430
also be that there are host responses
 

00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:07.060
also be that there are host responses
involved in the disease also so the

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:07.070
involved in the disease also so the
 

00:09:07.070 --> 00:09:09.400
involved in the disease also so the
incubation period is longer an example

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:09.410
incubation period is longer an example
 

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.820
incubation period is longer an example
of this is measles so here is a table

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:12.830
of this is measles so here is a table
 

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.370
of this is measles so here is a table

then it goes away because the virus

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:40.550
then it goes away because the virus
 

00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:43.060
then it goes away because the virus
never gets the endpoint and you may not

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:43.070
never gets the endpoint and you may not
 

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:44.530
never gets the endpoint and you may not
think anything of it you'll come to

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:44.540
think anything of it you'll come to
 

00:11:44.540 --> 00:11:47.079
think anything of it you'll come to
class and spread the infection to others

00:11:47.079 --> 00:11:47.089
class and spread the infection to others
 

00:11:47.089 --> 00:11:49.269
class and spread the infection to others
or you may not have any symptoms at all

00:11:49.269 --> 00:11:49.279
or you may not have any symptoms at all
 

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:51.250
or you may not have any symptoms at all
in your shedding infection so these are

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:51.260
in your shedding infection so these are
 

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.980
in your shedding infection so these are
in apparent acute infections how do we

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:53.990
in apparent acute infections how do we
 

00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:56.260
in apparent acute infections how do we
know that these occur well there's many

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:56.270
know that these occur well there's many
 

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:58.540
know that these occur well there's many
studies have been done in populations

00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:58.550
studies have been done in populations
 

00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:00.220
studies have been done in populations
looking at antibodies against specific

looking at antibodies against specific
 

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.199
looking at antibodies against specific
viruses and you can see in a population

00:12:02.199 --> 00:12:02.209
viruses and you can see in a population
 

00:12:02.209 --> 00:12:04.540
viruses and you can see in a population
there is no disease yet there is a rise

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:04.550
there is no disease yet there is a rise
 

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:06.370
there is no disease yet there is a rise
in antibody titer which means that these

00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:06.380
in antibody titer which means that these
 

00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:09.670
in antibody titer which means that these
people have been infected well-adapted

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:09.680
people have been infected well-adapted
 

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.420
people have been infected well-adapted
pathogens often follow this pattern a

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:12.430
pathogens often follow this pattern a
 

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:14.889
pathogens often follow this pattern a
virus does not have to produce disease

00:12:14.889 --> 00:12:14.899
virus does not have to produce disease
 

00:12:14.899 --> 00:12:17.410
virus does not have to produce disease
in order to spread of course in some

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:17.420
in order to spread of course in some
 

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.480
in order to spread of course in some
cases it helps if the virus induces

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:19.490
cases it helps if the virus induces
 

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:21.910
cases it helps if the virus induces
coughing or sneezing but it isn't

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920
coughing or sneezing but it isn't
 

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.160
coughing or sneezing but it isn't
essential so well-adapted pathogens that

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.170
essential so well-adapted pathogens that
 

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:26.139
essential so well-adapted pathogens that
don't kill their hosts have this pattern

00:12:26.139 --> 00:12:26.149
don't kill their hosts have this pattern
 

00:12:26.149 --> 00:12:29.050
don't kill their hosts have this pattern
of in apparent infections so a good

00:12:29.050 --> 00:12:29.060
of in apparent infections so a good
 

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.860
of in apparent infections so a good
example is not over 90% of polio

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:31.870
example is not over 90% of polio
 

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.480
example is not over 90% of polio
infections are in a parent and that's

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:34.490
infections are in a parent and that's
 

00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:36.910
infections are in a parent and that's
why this is a tough virus to detect in

00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:36.920
why this is a tough virus to detect in
 

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.650
why this is a tough virus to detect in
the population at least years ago when

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:38.660
the population at least years ago when
 

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.960
the population at least years ago when
it was rampant very hard to detect

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:40.970
it was rampant very hard to detect
 

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:42.819
it was rampant very hard to detect
because the people most of the people

00:12:42.819 --> 00:12:42.829
because the people most of the people
 

00:12:42.829 --> 00:12:44.380
because the people most of the people
were infected in shedding and

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:44.390
were infected in shedding and
 

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.290
were infected in shedding and
transmitting to others didn't have a

symptoms so you couldn't put them away

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:48.820
symptoms so you couldn't put them away
 

00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:50.310
symptoms so you couldn't put them away
until the virus was gone

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320
until the virus was gone
 

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.690
until the virus was gone
so quarantining was actually used for to

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:54.700
so quarantining was actually used for to
 

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.340
so quarantining was actually used for to
try and prevent the spread of polio in

00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:56.350
try and prevent the spread of polio in
 

00:12:56.350 --> 00:12:58.080
try and prevent the spread of polio in
the US but it was absolutely useless

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:58.090
the US but it was absolutely useless
 

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:00.390
the US but it was absolutely useless
because of this number he had some

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:00.400
because of this number he had some
 

00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:02.520
because of this number he had some
people with paralysis which are 1% of

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:02.530
people with paralysis which are 1% of
 

00:13:02.530 --> 00:13:03.900
people with paralysis which are 1% of
the total infections they're in the

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:03.910
the total infections they're in the
 

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:05.670
the total infections they're in the
hospital they're quarantined and the

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:05.680
hospital they're quarantined and the
 

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.520
hospital they're quarantined and the
rest of the 99% are walking around with

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:08.530
rest of the 99% are walking around with
 

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:18.680
rest of the 99% are walking around with
mild infection spreading the virus yes

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:18.690
 
 

00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:21.000
 
is there an evolutionary advantage

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.010
is there an evolutionary advantage
 

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.130
is there an evolutionary advantage
that's a good question I'm not sure that

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:23.140
that's a good question I'm not sure that
 

00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.590
that's a good question I'm not sure that
it matters I think it depends on the

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600
it matters I think it depends on the
 

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.610
it matters I think it depends on the
virus for for example measles virus

00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:29.620
virus for for example measles virus
 

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:32.100
virus for for example measles virus
requires a very large population of

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:32.110
requires a very large population of
 

00:13:32.110 --> 00:13:33.870
requires a very large population of
susceptible individuals and if it kills

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880
susceptible individuals and if it kills
 

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.850
susceptible individuals and if it kills
the host then it's not going to be able

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:35.860
the host then it's not going to be able
 

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.800
the host then it's not going to be able
to spread effectively so I think it

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:37.810
to spread effectively so I think it
 

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.680
to spread effectively so I think it
depends on the virus this is something

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:40.690
depends on the virus this is something
 

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:42.840
depends on the virus this is something
we talk about all the time is is it of

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:42.850
we talk about all the time is is it of
 

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.820
we talk about all the time is is it of
any value for a virus to become more

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:44.830
any value for a virus to become more
 

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:47.280
any value for a virus to become more
virulent I think not in most cases it

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:47.290
virulent I think not in most cases it
 

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:49.200
virulent I think not in most cases it
just needs to spread transmissibility is

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:49.210
just needs to spread transmissibility is
 

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:52.230
just needs to spread transmissibility is
what is the major factor that really is

00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240
what is the major factor that really is
 

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.960
what is the major factor that really is
selected for it may be that higher

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:54.970
selected for it may be that higher
 

00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:56.300
selected for it may be that higher
virulence goes along with that

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:56.310
virulence goes along with that
 

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:58.020
virulence goes along with that
accidentally but I don't think it's

00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.030
accidentally but I don't think it's
 

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.210
accidentally but I don't think it's
needed so I would guess that these kinds

00:14:00.210 --> 00:14:00.220
needed so I would guess that these kinds
 

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.580
needed so I would guess that these kinds
of in apparent infections are actually

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:02.590
of in apparent infections are actually
 

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:05.670
of in apparent infections are actually
fine and if if we did more sampling of

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680
fine and if if we did more sampling of
 

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.380
fine and if if we did more sampling of
healthy populations I think we would

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:07.390
healthy populations I think we would
 

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.330
healthy populations I think we would
find that there are a lot of in apparent

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:09.340
find that there are a lot of in apparent
 

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.610
find that there are a lot of in apparent
infections we don't know about I think

00:14:11.610 --> 00:14:11.620
infections we don't know about I think
 

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.680
infections we don't know about I think

out in the wild nonhumans I suspect
 

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.540
out in the wild nonhumans I suspect
there are many many unknown virus

he's again we call zoonotic infections

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:04.050
 
 

00:15:04.050 --> 00:15:07.259
 
Ebola viruses there is a zoonotic

00:15:07.259 --> 00:15:07.269
Ebola viruses there is a zoonotic

that as well
 

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:17.129
that as well
so these infections are hard to deal

00:15:17.129 --> 00:15:17.139
so these infections are hard to deal
 

00:15:17.139 --> 00:15:19.259
so these infections are hard to deal
with in terms of Public Health so people

00:15:19.259 --> 00:15:19.269
with in terms of Public Health so people
 

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:20.790
with in terms of Public Health so people
who deal with human health physicians

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800
who deal with human health physicians

health officials because by the time you
feel ill or make a an immune response

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:28.180
feel ill or make a an immune response

most acute infections are over so if you
 

00:15:31.029 --> 00:15:32.790
most acute infections are over so if you
remember the curve the graph we showed

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800
remember the curve the graph we showed
 

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.220
remember the curve the graph we showed
of the immune response versus virus the

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:35.230
of the immune response versus virus the
 

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:36.569
of the immune response versus virus the
virus Peaks and then the immune response

00:15:36.569 --> 00:15:36.579
virus Peaks and then the immune response
 

00:15:36.579 --> 00:15:38.400
virus Peaks and then the immune response
is really kicking in and really the

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:38.410
is really kicking in and really the
 

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.879

00:15:41.879 --> 00:15:41.889
infection is over for the most part so
 

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:44.370
infection is over for the most part so
you feel ill it's really kind of late to

you feel ill it's really kind of late to
 

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:46.019
you feel ill it's really kind of late to
do anything about it if you have an

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.990
for at least a couple of days of course
adaptive ReCellular responses in

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000
adaptive ReCellular responses in
 

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.550
adaptive ReCellular responses in
particular are very important for

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:03.560
particular are very important for
 

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.140
particular are very important for
resolving these infections but the

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:05.150
resolving these infections but the
 

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:06.850
resolving these infections but the
antibody responses for the most part

00:19:06.850 --> 00:19:06.860
antibody responses for the most part
 

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:09.430
antibody responses for the most part
don't do anything the adaptive response

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:09.440
don't do anything the adaptive response
 

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.910
don't do anything the adaptive response
clears your virus and provides memory

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:11.920
clears your virus and provides memory
 

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:14.080
clears your virus and provides memory
now what would happen if you had a

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:14.090
now what would happen if you had a
 

00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.090
now what would happen if you had a
strong innate defense but no adaptive

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:16.100
strong innate defense but no adaptive
 

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:17.620
strong innate defense but no adaptive
defense they could to you can actually

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:17.630
defense they could to you can actually
 

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.810
defense they could to you can actually
do this experimentally in animals and

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:19.820
do this experimentally in animals and
 

00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:22.240
do this experimentally in animals and
the answer is that without innate

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:22.250
the answer is that without innate
 

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:25.060
the answer is that without innate
defenses the infection can spread from

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:25.070
defenses the infection can spread from
 

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:27.930
defenses the infection can spread from
the primary site of in fact

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:27.940
the primary site of in fact
 

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.980
the primary site of in fact
so this being a response of course is

00:19:31.980 --> 00:19:31.990
so this being a response of course is
 

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.290
so this being a response of course is
central in controlling the infection and

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:35.300
central in controlling the infection and
 

00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:38.140
central in controlling the infection and
if it can't control it the the adaptive

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:38.150
if it can't control it the the adaptive
 

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:39.690
if it can't control it the the adaptive
response has to kick in

00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:39.700
response has to kick in
 

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:43.020
response has to kick in
and people without immune responses

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:43.030
and people without immune responses
 

00:19:43.030 --> 00:19:45.430
and people without immune responses
immunocompromised individuals they may

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440
immunocompromised individuals they may
 

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.860
immunocompromised individuals they may
not have either B cells or T cells where

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:47.870
not have either B cells or T cells where
 

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.320
not have either B cells or T cells where
they may not have either infections

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:50.330
they may not have either infections
 

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.270
they may not have either infections
acute infections in particular can be

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:52.280
acute infections in particular can be
 

00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.430
acute infections in particular can be
disastrous now the memory aspect of

00:19:57.430 --> 00:19:57.440
disastrous now the memory aspect of
 

00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:00.160
disastrous now the memory aspect of
acute infections is important

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.170
acute infections is important
 

00:20:00.170 --> 00:20:02.080
acute infections is important
acute infections are typically usually

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:02.090
acute infections are typically usually
 

00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:04.810
acute infections are typically usually
one-time-only infections and therefore

00:20:04.810 --> 00:20:04.820
one-time-only infections and therefore
 

00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.150
one-time-only infections and therefore
we can make vaccines against the agents

00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:07.160
we can make vaccines against the agents
 

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.460
we can make vaccines against the agents
to provide protection and in fact we

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:09.470
to provide protection and in fact we
 

00:20:09.470 --> 00:20:11.890
to provide protection and in fact we
learned that vaccines could work many

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:11.900
learned that vaccines could work many
 

00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.440
learned that vaccines could work many
years ago from memory and people people

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:14.450
years ago from memory and people people
 

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:15.700
years ago from memory and people people
who had an infection didn't get

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:15.710
who had an infection didn't get
 

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.490
who had an infection didn't get
reinfected again Edward Jenner noticed

00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:18.500
reinfected again Edward Jenner noticed
 

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.100
reinfected again Edward Jenner noticed
this in terms of smallpox and we'll talk

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:21.110
this in terms of smallpox and we'll talk
 

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:24.790
this in terms of smallpox and we'll talk
about that in the vaccine lecture but

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:24.800
about that in the vaccine lecture but
 

00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.460
about that in the vaccine lecture but
there are always exceptions and

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:26.470
there are always exceptions and
 

00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:29.710
there are always exceptions and
antigenic variation can bypass adaptive

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720
antigenic variation can bypass adaptive
 

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:32.680
antigenic variation can bypass adaptive
immune defenses so by antigenic

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:32.690
immune defenses so by antigenic
 

00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:35.140
immune defenses so by antigenic
variation we mean for example influenza

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:35.150
variation we mean for example influenza
 

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.810
variation we mean for example influenza
virus undergoes a yearly antigenic

00:20:37.810 --> 00:20:37.820
virus undergoes a yearly antigenic
 

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:41.080
virus undergoes a yearly antigenic
variation so if you get a vaccine this

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:41.090
variation so if you get a vaccine this
 

00:20:41.090 --> 00:20:42.730
variation so if you get a vaccine this
year against the currently circulating

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:42.740
year against the currently circulating
 

00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.580
year against the currently circulating
strains by a year or two from now the

00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:45.590
strains by a year or two from now the
 

00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:48.340
strains by a year or two from now the
strain will have varied sufficiently so

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:48.350
strain will have varied sufficiently so
 

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:50.500
strain will have varied sufficiently so
that the the memory that you have isn't

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:50.510
that the the memory that you have isn't
 

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:57.850
that the the memory that you have isn't
enough to prevent infection yeah well

00:20:57.850 --> 00:20:57.860
enough to prevent infection yeah well
 

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.580
enough to prevent infection yeah well
remember all viruses make mistakes in

00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:00.590
remember all viruses make mistakes in
 

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:03.370
remember all viruses make mistakes in
their in replicating a nucleic acid the

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:03.380
their in replicating a nucleic acid the
 

00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:06.220
their in replicating a nucleic acid the
RNA viruses can't correct the mistake so

00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:06.230
RNA viruses can't correct the mistake so
 

00:21:06.230 --> 00:21:08.710
RNA viruses can't correct the mistake so
they have a very high error rate so all

00:21:08.710 --> 00:21:08.720
they have a very high error rate so all
 

00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.840
they have a very high error rate so all
RNA viruses make a lot of mistakes and

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:10.850
RNA viruses make a lot of mistakes and
 

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:13.930
RNA viruses make a lot of mistakes and
some can't accommodate those changes in

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:13.940
some can't accommodate those changes in
 

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.750
some can't accommodate those changes in
their proteins so influenza virus for

00:21:16.750 --> 00:21:16.760
their proteins so influenza virus for
 

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:18.430
their proteins so influenza virus for
reasons we don't understand the

00:21:18.430 --> 00:21:18.440
reasons we don't understand the
 

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:20.620
reasons we don't understand the
glycoproteins on the surface can undergo

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:20.630
glycoproteins on the surface can undergo
 

00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:22.540
glycoproteins on the surface can undergo
enormous changes they're all localized

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:22.550
enormous changes they're all localized
 

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:24.820
enormous changes they're all localized
at near the receptor binding portion and

00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:24.830
at near the receptor binding portion and
 

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:28.450
at near the receptor binding portion and
it can kind of accommodate those other

00:21:28.450 --> 00:21:28.460
it can kind of accommodate those other
 

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:30.550
it can kind of accommodate those other
viruses can't they don't do a measles

00:21:30.550 --> 00:21:30.560
viruses can't they don't do a measles
 

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.020
viruses can't they don't do a measles
virus hardly varies at all they're

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:32.030
virus hardly varies at all they're
 

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.390
virus hardly varies at all they're
structural constraints so it's only

00:21:34.390 --> 00:21:34.400
structural constraints so it's only
 

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.440
structural constraints so it's only
answer I can give you we don't

00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:35.450
answer I can give you we don't
 

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:37.060
answer I can give you we don't
understand the basis for that but some

00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:37.070
understand the basis for that but some
 

00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:38.700
understand the basis for that but some
viruses are better at accommodate

00:21:38.700 --> 00:21:38.710
viruses are better at accommodate
 

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:44.940
viruses are better at accommodate
than others now I don't think the

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:44.950
than others now I don't think the
 

00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:46.950
than others now I don't think the
vaccine really pushes it because not

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960
vaccine really pushes it because not
 

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.139
vaccine really pushes it because not
enough people are where ever immunized

00:21:49.139 --> 00:21:49.149
enough people are where ever immunized
 

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:50.760
enough people are where ever immunized
in any one year to make a difference

00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:50.770
in any one year to make a difference
 

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.310
in any one year to make a difference
probably it's just that the population

00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:53.320
probably it's just that the population
 

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.440
probably it's just that the population
immunity pushes the virus to mutate or

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:55.450
immunity pushes the virus to mutate or
 

00:21:55.450 --> 00:21:57.810
immunity pushes the virus to mutate or
selects for viruses that escape the

00:21:57.810 --> 00:21:57.820
selects for viruses that escape the
 

00:21:57.820 --> 00:21:59.220
selects for viruses that escape the
immunity

00:21:59.220 --> 00:21:59.230
immunity
 

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:02.190
immunity
the alternative is Rhino virus it

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.200
the alternative is Rhino virus it
 

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.200
the alternative is Rhino virus it
doesn't undergo variation but there are

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:04.210
doesn't undergo variation but there are
 

00:22:04.210 --> 00:22:05.730
doesn't undergo variation but there are
hundreds more than a hundred different

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:05.740
hundreds more than a hundred different
 

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:07.830
hundreds more than a hundred different
serotypes circulating at the same time

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840
serotypes circulating at the same time
 

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.470
serotypes circulating at the same time
and so every and any given year you're

00:22:10.470 --> 00:22:10.480
and so every and any given year you're
 

00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:16.100
and so every and any given year you're
likely to get another common cold yeah

00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:16.110
 
 

00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.419
 
for flu I don't know offhand but that's

00:22:18.419 --> 00:22:18.429
for flu I don't know offhand but that's
 

00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:21.060
for flu I don't know offhand but that's
different for every virus right I don't

00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:21.070
different for every virus right I don't
 

00:22:21.070 --> 00:22:22.919
different for every virus right I don't
know what the number is for flu at the

00:22:22.919 --> 00:22:22.929
know what the number is for flu at the
 

00:22:22.929 --> 00:22:26.700
know what the number is for flu at the
moment to say a hundred percent so they

00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:26.710
moment to say a hundred percent so they
 

00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:32.430
moment to say a hundred percent so they
get vaccinated okay so we're going to

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440
get vaccinated okay so we're going to
 

00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.919
get vaccinated okay so we're going to
talk about some specific examples of

00:22:34.919 --> 00:22:34.929
talk about some specific examples of
 

00:22:34.929 --> 00:22:37.799
talk about some specific examples of
acute infections I picked these five

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:37.809
acute infections I picked these five
 

00:22:37.809 --> 00:22:39.750
acute infections I picked these five
because they're transmitted in slightly

00:22:39.750 --> 00:22:39.760
because they're transmitted in slightly
 

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.840
because they're transmitted in slightly
different ways and just so you can learn

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:42.850
different ways and just so you can learn
 

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:44.880
different ways and just so you can learn
about how acute infections develop how

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:44.890
about how acute infections develop how
 

00:22:44.890 --> 00:22:46.380
about how acute infections develop how
they're transmitted in some of the

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:46.390
they're transmitted in some of the
 

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:48.960
they're transmitted in some of the
details dealing with them so the first

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:48.970
details dealing with them so the first
 

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.149
details dealing with them so the first
one we'll talk about is influenza virus

00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:51.159
one we'll talk about is influenza virus
 

00:22:51.159 --> 00:22:54.360
one we'll talk about is influenza virus
and here is an influenza virion at the

00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:54.370
and here is an influenza virion at the
 

00:22:54.370 --> 00:22:55.830
and here is an influenza virion at the
upper right if you remember it is an

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840
upper right if you remember it is an
 

00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:58.680
upper right if you remember it is an
envelope with viruses virus the RNAs are

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:58.690
envelope with viruses virus the RNAs are
 

00:22:58.690 --> 00:23:00.419
envelope with viruses virus the RNAs are
negative stranded and they're present in

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:00.429
negative stranded and they're present in
 

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:03.389
negative stranded and they're present in
segments so these viruses can go in to

00:23:03.389 --> 00:23:03.399
segments so these viruses can go in to
 

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.610
segments so these viruses can go in to
go reassortment which is another way to

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:05.620
go reassortment which is another way to
 

00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:09.240
go reassortment which is another way to
have genetic variation there are three

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:09.250
have genetic variation there are three
 

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:11.460
have genetic variation there are three
types of influenza they're called

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:11.470
types of influenza they're called
 

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.730
types of influenza they're called
influenza A B and C the a and b f--

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:14.740
influenza A B and C the a and b f--
 

00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.740
influenza A B and C the a and b f--
influenza strains cause a very similar

00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:16.750
influenza strains cause a very similar
 

00:23:16.750 --> 00:23:20.130
influenza strains cause a very similar
respiratory disease influenza C virus is

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:20.140
respiratory disease influenza C virus is
 

00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:23.190
respiratory disease influenza C virus is
mostly in apparent infections so there

00:23:23.190 --> 00:23:23.200
mostly in apparent infections so there
 

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:24.360
mostly in apparent infections so there
are a lot of there's a lot of

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:24.370
are a lot of there's a lot of
 

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.220
are a lot of there's a lot of
transmission of influenza C that we've

00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:26.230
transmission of influenza C that we've
 

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:28.680
transmission of influenza C that we've
learned about through serous surveys but

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:28.690
learned about through serous surveys but
 

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.659
learned about through serous surveys but
very little disease associated with it

00:23:30.659 --> 00:23:30.669
very little disease associated with it
 

00:23:30.669 --> 00:23:33.029
very little disease associated with it
so we don't immunize against influenza C

00:23:33.029 --> 00:23:33.039
so we don't immunize against influenza C
 

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:34.380
so we don't immunize against influenza C
because it doesn't really cause

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:34.390
because it doesn't really cause
 

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.630
because it doesn't really cause
significant disease we do immunize

00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:36.640
significant disease we do immunize
 

00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:41.340
significant disease we do immunize
against a and B influenza A strains

00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:41.350
against a and B influenza A strains
 

00:23:41.350 --> 00:23:45.000
against a and B influenza A strains
cause pandemics these are the outbreaks

first time I might be wrong on that
 

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:17.270
first time I might be wrong on that
anybody know that year 68 was he elected

00:24:17.270 --> 00:24:17.280
anybody know that year 68 was he elected
 

00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.600
anybody know that year 68 was he elected
in 68 but doesn't matter it was 1968 so

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:20.610
in 68 but doesn't matter it was 1968 so
 

00:24:20.610 --> 00:24:22.730
in 68 but doesn't matter it was 1968 so
that was a long period that was a long

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740
that was a long period that was a long
 

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:28.070
that was a long period that was a long
period between 68 and 2009 the further

00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080
period between 68 and 2009 the further
 

00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:30.740
period between 68 and 2009 the further
the one before 68 was 57 so that was

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:30.750
the one before 68 was 57 so that was
 

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.280
the one before 68 was 57 so that was
much shorter and then before 57 was 1918

00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:34.290
much shorter and then before 57 was 1918
 

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.290
much shorter and then before 57 was 1918
so again much longer so it's not

00:24:36.290 --> 00:24:36.300
so again much longer so it's not
 

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.590
so again much longer so it's not
terribly regular but every so many years

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:38.600
terribly regular but every so many years
 

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:40.640
terribly regular but every so many years
there is a pandemic and that only

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:40.650
there is a pandemic and that only
 

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:42.770
there is a pandemic and that only
happens with influenza A virus this

00:24:42.770 --> 00:24:42.780
happens with influenza A virus this
 

00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.110
happens with influenza A virus this
virus the hallmark of this is antigenic

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:45.120
virus the hallmark of this is antigenic
 

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.750
virus the hallmark of this is antigenic
variation every year or two the virus

00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760
variation every year or two the virus
 

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.760
variation every year or two the virus
changes enough to evade your immunity

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:49.770
changes enough to evade your immunity
 

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:55.040
changes enough to evade your immunity
and every X number of years it changes

00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:55.050
and every X number of years it changes
 

00:24:55.050 --> 00:24:56.950
and every X number of years it changes
substantially so you have a big outbreak

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960
substantially so you have a big outbreak
 

00:24:56.960 --> 00:25:06.620
substantially so you have a big outbreak
yes it's probably a number of factors so

00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:06.630
yes it's probably a number of factors so
 

00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:09.230
yes it's probably a number of factors so
when when say let's say we have a strain

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:09.240
when when say let's say we have a strain
 

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:11.330
when when say let's say we have a strain
of influenza circulating for ten or

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:11.340
of influenza circulating for ten or
 

00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:13.310
of influenza circulating for ten or
twenty years it changes a little bit

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320
twenty years it changes a little bit
 

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.220
twenty years it changes a little bit
every few years but there's still a

00:25:16.220 --> 00:25:16.230
every few years but there's still a
 

00:25:16.230 --> 00:25:18.620
every few years but there's still a
large population immunity against it and

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:18.630
large population immunity against it and
 

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.590
large population immunity against it and
then if another strain is introduced

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600
then if another strain is introduced
 

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.630
then if another strain is introduced
into the population which in a

00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640
into the population which in a
 

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:25.340
into the population which in a
population has no immunity against it

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:25.350
population has no immunity against it
 

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.080
population has no immunity against it
that will cause a pandemic so it's

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:27.090
that will cause a pandemic so it's
 

00:25:27.090 --> 00:25:28.640
that will cause a pandemic so it's
dependent on the introduction of a new

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:28.650
dependent on the introduction of a new
 

00:25:28.650 --> 00:25:32.200
dependent on the introduction of a new
strain probably from an animal vector so

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.210
strain probably from an animal vector so
 

00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:35.660
strain probably from an animal vector so
2009 we believe that a new strain came

00:25:35.660 --> 00:25:35.670
2009 we believe that a new strain came
 

00:25:35.670 --> 00:25:38.840
2009 we believe that a new strain came
from pigs and it reasserted in pigs and

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:38.850
from pigs and it reasserted in pigs and
 

00:25:38.850 --> 00:25:40.400
from pigs and it reasserted in pigs and
then it got into people and because

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:40.410
then it got into people and because
 

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:41.840
then it got into people and because
there was no immunity and also had the

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:41.850
there was no immunity and also had the
 

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.910
there was no immunity and also had the
ability to transmit effectively in

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:43.920
ability to transmit effectively in
 

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.540
ability to transmit effectively in
people it caused the pandemic so pigs we

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:47.550
people it caused the pandemic so pigs we
 

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:49.280
people it caused the pandemic so pigs we
have created this reservoir because

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:49.290
have created this reservoir because
 

00:25:49.290 --> 00:25:50.990
have created this reservoir because
these pigs are the pig industry that we

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000
these pigs are the pig industry that we
 

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.670
these pigs are the pig industry that we
grow up and they happen to be very

00:25:52.670 --> 00:25:52.680
grow up and they happen to be very
 

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.560
grow up and they happen to be very
susceptible to various strains of

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:54.570
susceptible to various strains of
 

00:25:54.570 --> 00:25:56.630
susceptible to various strains of
influenza they get infected by their

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:56.640
influenza they get infected by their
 

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.730
influenza they get infected by their
handlers they get infected by birds that

00:25:58.730 --> 00:25:58.740
handlers they get infected by birds that
 

00:25:58.740 --> 00:26:00.800
handlers they get infected by birds that
fly overhead and drop on them

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:00.810
fly overhead and drop on them
 

00:26:00.810 --> 00:26:02.510
fly overhead and drop on them
influenza viruses so they could they

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:02.520
influenza viruses so they could they
 

00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:06.639
influenza viruses so they could they
turn out to be a very good mixing vessel

00:26:06.639 --> 00:26:06.649
 
 

00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:09.560
 
so influenza viruses are respiratory

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:09.570
so influenza viruses are respiratory
 

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:11.509
so influenza viruses are respiratory
pathogens they enter your respiratory

00:26:11.509 --> 00:26:11.519
pathogens they enter your respiratory
 

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:15.470
pathogens they enter your respiratory

a contaminated surface and put you the

00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980
a contaminated surface and put you the
 

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.799
a contaminated surface and put you the
virus into your nose it was a very

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:27.809
virus into your nose it was a very
 

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:30.409
virus into your nose it was a very
interesting study done a couple of many

00:26:30.409 --> 00:26:30.419
interesting study done a couple of many
 

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:32.840
interesting study done a couple of many
about five or six years ago they said

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:32.850
about five or six years ago they said
 

00:26:32.850 --> 00:26:35.269
about five or six years ago they said
Swiss biologist he took bank notes in

00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279
Swiss biologist he took bank notes in
 

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:36.980
Swiss biologist he took bank notes in
Switzerland and they brought him into

00:26:36.980 --> 00:26:36.990
Switzerland and they brought him into
 

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:38.960
Switzerland and they brought him into
the lab and cut them up and looked for

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:38.970
the lab and cut them up and looked for
 

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.419
the lab and cut them up and looked for
influenza virus on them and actually

00:26:41.419 --> 00:26:41.429
influenza virus on them and actually
 

00:26:41.429 --> 00:26:43.159
influenza virus on them and actually
what they did is they put virus on the

00:26:43.159 --> 00:26:43.169
what they did is they put virus on the
 

00:26:43.169 --> 00:26:45.470
what they did is they put virus on the
banknotes and then they saw how long it

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480
banknotes and then they saw how long it
 

00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:46.999
banknotes and then they saw how long it
lasted and they found that it could last

00:26:46.999 --> 00:26:47.009
lasted and they found that it could last
 

00:26:47.009 --> 00:26:50.930
lasted and they found that it could last
over a week on the banknotes so you know

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:50.940
over a week on the banknotes so you know
 

00:26:50.940 --> 00:26:52.399
over a week on the banknotes so you know
people are going in there and taking

00:26:52.399 --> 00:26:52.409
people are going in there and taking
 

00:26:52.409 --> 00:26:54.289
people are going in there and taking
their money out and they're rubbing

00:26:54.289 --> 00:26:54.299
their money out and they're rubbing
 

00:26:54.299 --> 00:26:55.730
their money out and they're rubbing
their nose and put on the money someone

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:55.740
their nose and put on the money someone
 

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:57.409
their nose and put on the money someone
else could get and in fact they found

00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:57.419
else could get and in fact they found
 

00:26:57.419 --> 00:26:59.269
else could get and in fact they found
that if there's mucus with the virus it

00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279
that if there's mucus with the virus it
 

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:01.909
that if there's mucus with the virus it
lasts even longer it protects it so you

00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919
lasts even longer it protects it so you
 

00:27:01.919 --> 00:27:03.560
lasts even longer it protects it so you
can get it by contact not just by

00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:03.570
can get it by contact not just by
 

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.320
can get it by contact not just by
aerosol yeah only in Switzerland yeah

00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:08.330
aerosol yeah only in Switzerland yeah
 

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:12.639

who else would you do that study right

00:27:12.639 --> 00:27:12.649
who else would you do that study right

who else would you do that study right
so the virus enters your upper tract it

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:15.600
so the virus enters your upper tract it
 

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:18.649
so the virus enters your upper tract it
can multiply there and cause a variety

00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659
can multiply there and cause a variety
 

00:27:18.659 --> 00:27:20.060

characteristically able to go down the
 

00:27:28.049 --> 00:27:30.310
characteristically able to go down the
track it moves down the respiratory

00:27:30.310 --> 00:27:30.320
track it moves down the respiratory
 

00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.869
track it moves down the respiratory

epithelium all the way down into the
 

00:27:32.879 --> 00:27:35.029
epithelium all the way down into the
trachea and that's why when you get flu

00:27:35.029 --> 00:27:35.039
trachea and that's why when you get flu
 

00:27:35.039 --> 00:27:37.009

you really feel this infection in your

00:27:37.009 --> 00:27:37.019
you really feel this infection in your
 

00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:39.379
you really feel this infection in your
chest you could absolutely distinguish

00:27:39.379 --> 00:27:39.389
chest you could absolutely distinguish
 

00:27:39.389 --> 00:27:41.810
chest you could absolutely distinguish
it from an upper tract infection in the

00:27:41.810 --> 00:27:41.820
it from an upper tract infection in the
 

00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:43.580
it from an upper tract infection in the
most serious cases it gets down into

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:43.590
most serious cases it gets down into
 

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.100
most serious cases it gets down into
your alveoli and causes pneumonia

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:45.110
your alveoli and causes pneumonia
 

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.389

throughout your tract and this depends
 

00:29:27.899 --> 00:29:30.320
throughout your tract and this depends
on the receptors human influenza strains

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:30.330
on the receptors human influenza strains
 

00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:31.820

diagnose it it's very difficult because

00:29:48.769 --> 00:29:48.779
diagnose it it's very difficult because
 

00:29:48.779 --> 00:29:51.440
diagnose it it's very difficult because
it's a quick infection but we do try and

it's a quick infection but we do try and
 

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:54.590
it's a quick infection but we do try and
diagnose it because we have antivirals

involve taking some respiratory
 

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:49.789
involve taking some respiratory
secretion and putting it on a stick of

00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799
secretion and putting it on a stick of
 

00:30:49.799 --> 00:30:51.529
secretion and putting it on a stick of
some kind which looks for viral antigen

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:51.539
some kind which looks for viral antigen
 

00:30:51.539 --> 00:30:53.629
some kind which looks for viral antigen
it develops very quickly they have about

00:30:53.629 --> 00:30:53.639
it develops very quickly they have about
 

00:30:53.639 --> 00:30:56.450
it develops very quickly they have about
a 50% success rate so they'll say no you

00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460
a 50% success rate so they'll say no you
 

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.369
a 50% success rate so they'll say no you
don't have flu when you do have flu half

00:30:58.369 --> 00:30:58.379
don't have flu when you do have flu half
 

00:30:58.379 --> 00:30:59.869
don't have flu when you do have flu half
the time so they have really poor

00:30:59.869 --> 00:30:59.879
the time so they have really poor
 

00:30:59.879 --> 00:31:02.839
the time so they have really poor
accuracy the best test of course are PCR

00:31:02.839 --> 00:31:02.849
accuracy the best test of course are PCR
 

00:31:02.849 --> 00:31:04.999
accuracy the best test of course are PCR
based tests but if you go to a doctor's

00:31:04.999 --> 00:31:05.009
based tests but if you go to a doctor's
 

00:31:05.009 --> 00:31:07.099
based tests but if you go to a doctor's
office and you're coughing and hacking

00:31:07.099 --> 00:31:07.109
office and you're coughing and hacking
 

00:31:07.109 --> 00:31:08.419
office and you're coughing and hacking
and the physician is just going to

00:31:08.419 --> 00:31:08.429
and the physician is just going to
 

00:31:08.429 --> 00:31:10.879
and the physician is just going to
prescribed Tamiflu especially if it's

00:31:10.879 --> 00:31:10.889
prescribed Tamiflu especially if it's
 

00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:12.589
prescribed Tamiflu especially if it's
flu season and you're not going to be

00:31:12.589 --> 00:31:12.599
flu season and you're not going to be
 

00:31:12.599 --> 00:31:14.930
flu season and you're not going to be
doing a PCR test PCR test will be done

00:31:14.930 --> 00:31:14.940
doing a PCR test PCR test will be done
 

00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:16.820
doing a PCR test PCR test will be done
to study spread of the infection in a

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:16.830
to study spread of the infection in a
 

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:19.700
to study spread of the infection in a
population but on a regular basis not

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:19.710
population but on a regular basis not
 

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:21.259
population but on a regular basis not
likely so here are some graphs that show

00:31:21.259 --> 00:31:21.269
likely so here are some graphs that show
 

00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:24.409
likely so here are some graphs that show
you symptoms versus virus shedding and

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:24.419
you symptoms versus virus shedding and
 

00:31:24.419 --> 00:31:25.820
you symptoms versus virus shedding and
immune responses let's start in the

00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:25.830
immune responses let's start in the
 

00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:30.019
immune responses let's start in the
upper left here this is actually a an

00:31:30.019 --> 00:31:30.029
upper left here this is actually a an
 

00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:31.489
upper left here this is actually a an
experiment that was done in volunteers

00:31:31.489 --> 00:31:31.499
experiment that was done in volunteers
 

00:31:31.499 --> 00:31:35.329
experiment that was done in volunteers
you can infect volunteers with influenza

00:31:35.329 --> 00:31:35.339
you can infect volunteers with influenza
 

00:31:35.339 --> 00:31:37.009
you can infect volunteers with influenza
virus strains you have to use strains

00:31:37.009 --> 00:31:37.019
virus strains you have to use strains
 

00:31:37.019 --> 00:31:38.659
virus strains you have to use strains
that don't kill you of course very very

00:31:38.659 --> 00:31:38.669
that don't kill you of course very very
 

00:31:38.669 --> 00:31:42.529
that don't kill you of course very very
mild strains and then you can measure

00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539
mild strains and then you can measure
 

00:31:42.539 --> 00:31:44.539
mild strains and then you can measure
symptoms and secretions so that's what

00:31:44.539 --> 00:31:44.549
symptoms and secretions so that's what
 

00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:45.709
symptoms and secretions so that's what
they've done in this experiment

00:31:45.709 --> 00:31:45.719
they've done in this experiment
 

00:31:45.719 --> 00:31:47.810
they've done in this experiment
inoculate these individuals and put the

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:47.820
inoculate these individuals and put the
 

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:50.810
inoculate these individuals and put the
pipette virus into their noses and then

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:50.820
pipette virus into their noses and then
 

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:53.060
pipette virus into their noses and then
they at different times after infection

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:53.070
they at different times after infection
 

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:55.129
they at different times after infection
they look at virus shedding which is the

00:31:55.129 --> 00:31:55.139
they look at virus shedding which is the
 

00:31:55.139 --> 00:31:57.889
they look at virus shedding which is the
dark circles here and the symptom score

00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899
dark circles here and the symptom score
 

00:31:57.899 --> 00:32:00.469
dark circles here and the symptom score
so you have to make a qualitative

00:32:00.469 --> 00:32:00.479
so you have to make a qualitative
 

00:32:00.479 --> 00:32:03.320
so you have to make a qualitative
judgment coughing amount of mucus for

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:03.330
judgment coughing amount of mucus for
 

00:32:03.330 --> 00:32:04.669
judgment coughing amount of mucus for
some of these they actually make you

00:32:04.669 --> 00:32:04.679
some of these they actually make you
 

00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:06.680
some of these they actually make you
blow your nose and they way the tissues

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:06.690
blow your nose and they way the tissues
 

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:10.459
blow your nose and they way the tissues
and they express it in grams of snot as

00:32:10.459 --> 00:32:10.469
and they express it in grams of snot as
 

00:32:10.469 --> 00:32:12.829
and they express it in grams of snot as
we use the car so here you see that

00:32:12.829 --> 00:32:12.839
we use the car so here you see that
 

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:15.289
we use the car so here you see that
there's not a big difference in the

00:32:15.289 --> 00:32:15.299
there's not a big difference in the
 

00:32:15.299 --> 00:32:17.119
there's not a big difference in the
amount of virus for when the virus

00:32:17.119 --> 00:32:17.129
amount of virus for when the virus
 

00:32:17.129 --> 00:32:19.729
amount of virus for when the virus
production occurs and the onset of

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:19.739
production occurs and the onset of
 

00:32:19.739 --> 00:32:22.039
production occurs and the onset of
symptoms you see a day one here there's

00:32:22.039 --> 00:32:22.049
symptoms you see a day one here there's
 

00:32:22.049 --> 00:32:24.649
symptoms you see a day one here there's
already shedding and there is already

00:32:24.649 --> 00:32:24.659
already shedding and there is already
 

00:32:24.659 --> 00:32:26.539
already shedding and there is already
some symptoms and they both go up pretty

00:32:26.539 --> 00:32:26.549
some symptoms and they both go up pretty
 

00:32:26.549 --> 00:32:29.930
some symptoms and they both go up pretty
much in parallel so that's good because

00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940
much in parallel so that's good because
 

00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:32.749
much in parallel so that's good because
as soon as you have symptoms it it means

00:32:32.749 --> 00:32:32.759
as soon as you have symptoms it it means
 

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:34.789
as soon as you have symptoms it it means
you're starting to shed virions but not

00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799
you're starting to shed virions but not
 

00:32:34.799 --> 00:32:35.570
you're starting to shed virions but not
before that

00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580
before that
 

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:38.029
before that
so for flu that's a good thing it's not

00:32:38.029 --> 00:32:38.039
so for flu that's a good thing it's not
 

00:32:38.039 --> 00:32:39.909
so for flu that's a good thing it's not
the case with all acute virus infections

00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919
the case with all acute virus infections
 

00:32:39.919 --> 00:32:42.499
the case with all acute virus infections
here we're looking at virus production

00:32:42.499 --> 00:32:42.509
here we're looking at virus production
 

00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:44.570
here we're looking at virus production
compared with interferon in the

00:32:44.570 --> 00:32:44.580
compared with interferon in the
 

00:32:44.580 --> 00:32:48.290
compared with interferon in the
dashed lines and then various antibodies

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:48.300
dashed lines and then various antibodies
 

00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.560
dashed lines and then various antibodies
in the nasal wash and in the serum so

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:51.570
in the nasal wash and in the serum so
 

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:53.720
in the nasal wash and in the serum so
you can see the virus peaks at about two

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:53.730
you can see the virus peaks at about two
 

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.940
you can see the virus peaks at about two
or three days in this experiment goes

00:32:55.940 --> 00:32:55.950
or three days in this experiment goes
 

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.460
or three days in this experiment goes
down rapidly and look at the antibodies

00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:58.470
down rapidly and look at the antibodies
 

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.460
down rapidly and look at the antibodies
or rays are coming up way after the

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:01.470
or rays are coming up way after the
 

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:02.840
or rays are coming up way after the
virus is already gone

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:02.850
virus is already gone
 

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.300
virus is already gone
so the EMA in this case and influenza

00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:05.310
so the EMA in this case and influenza
 

00:33:05.310 --> 00:33:07.550
so the EMA in this case and influenza
the antibody is not playing a major role

00:33:07.550 --> 00:33:07.560
the antibody is not playing a major role
 

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:09.290
the antibody is not playing a major role
in clearance all this virus is cleared

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:09.300
in clearance all this virus is cleared
 

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.900
in clearance all this virus is cleared
by the cellular response pretty much and

00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:11.910
by the cellular response pretty much and
 

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:13.400
by the cellular response pretty much and
then of course you do have memory which

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:13.410
then of course you do have memory which
 

00:33:13.410 --> 00:33:15.110
then of course you do have memory which
will help let next time you get infected

00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120
will help let next time you get infected
 

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.110
will help let next time you get infected
now influence is a seasonal infection in

00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:18.120
now influence is a seasonal infection in
 

00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:20.390
now influence is a seasonal infection in
in our climate we have a temperate

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:20.400
in our climate we have a temperate
 

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.730
in our climate we have a temperate
climate here it happens in the winter

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:22.740
climate here it happens in the winter
 

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:27.140
climate here it happens in the winter
and you can see it by this graph which

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:27.150
and you can see it by this graph which
 

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.210
and you can see it by this graph which
is looking at influenza of different

00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:29.220
is looking at influenza of different
 

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.600
is looking at influenza of different
types a and B and different subtypes

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:32.610
types a and B and different subtypes
 

00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.160
types a and B and different subtypes
which we haven't talked about but there

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:34.170
which we haven't talked about but there
 

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:36.980
which we haven't talked about but there
also a and B AAS are classified into

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:36.990
also a and B AAS are classified into
 

00:33:36.990 --> 00:33:40.220
also a and B AAS are classified into
different subtypes as are B's so you can

00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:40.230
different subtypes as are B's so you can
 

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:43.340
different subtypes as are B's so you can
see there's a peak here in the winter

00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:43.350
see there's a peak here in the winter
 

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:47.480
see there's a peak here in the winter
months every year 2004-2005 5 6 6 7 and

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:47.490
months every year 2004-2005 5 6 6 7 and

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.430
7 a very reproducible very little
activity in in between this is just a

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:52.440
activity in in between this is just a
 

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:55.340
activity in in between this is just a
number of samples that are positive for

00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:55.350
number of samples that are positive for
 

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:58.490
number of samples that are positive for
influenza here you can see here 3,000

00:33:58.490 --> 00:33:58.500
influenza here you can see here 3,000
 

00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.640
influenza here you can see here 3,000
peak here and these are done by CDC

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:01.650
peak here and these are done by CDC
 

00:34:01.650 --> 00:34:03.260
peak here and these are done by CDC
collaborating labs and then there's

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:03.270
collaborating labs and then there's
 

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:05.600
collaborating labs and then there's
subtypes as well so it's a seasonal

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:05.610
subtypes as well so it's a seasonal
 

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:08.000
subtypes as well so it's a seasonal
infection in temperate climates and

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:08.010
infection in temperate climates and
 

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:10.880
infection in temperate climates and
other climates it it also displays some

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:10.890
other climates it it also displays some
 

00:34:10.890 --> 00:34:12.320
other climates it it also displays some
seasonality but happens at different

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:12.330
seasonality but happens at different
 

00:34:12.330 --> 00:34:15.230
seasonality but happens at different
times of the year now what causes the

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240
times of the year now what causes the
 

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:17.000
times of the year now what causes the
symptoms of flu and the tissue damage

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:17.010
symptoms of flu and the tissue damage
 

00:34:17.010 --> 00:34:19.940
symptoms of flu and the tissue damage
well the virus replication does the

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:19.950
well the virus replication does the
 

00:34:19.950 --> 00:34:22.100
well the virus replication does the
virus is cytopathic and it kills cells

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:22.110
virus is cytopathic and it kills cells
 

00:34:22.110 --> 00:34:24.409

00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:39.030
paralyzed so that's the basis of the
 

00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.640
paralyzed so that's the basis of the
parallel

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:39.650
parallel
 

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:44.560

disease so here is a nice depiction of

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:44.570
disease so here is a nice depiction of
 

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:47.140
disease so here is a nice depiction of
the time course of polio this is taken

00:41:47.140 --> 00:41:47.150
the time course of polio this is taken
 

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.040
the time course of polio this is taken
from a text book it from the 1950s so

00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:51.050
from a text book it from the 1950s so
 

00:41:51.050 --> 00:41:52.870
from a text book it from the 1950s so
medical textbooks don't have polio in

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:52.880
medical textbooks don't have polio in
 

00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.210
medical textbooks don't have polio in
them anymore because we don't have it in

00:41:55.210 --> 00:41:55.220
them anymore because we don't have it in
 

00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:56.620
them anymore because we don't have it in
this country but in the 50s there was

00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:56.630
this country but in the 50s there was
 

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:58.930
this country but in the 50s there was
plenty of polio so every textbook of

00:41:58.930 --> 00:41:58.940
plenty of polio so every textbook of
 

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.880
plenty of polio so every textbook of
medicine had chapters on polio myelitis

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:00.890
medicine had chapters on polio myelitis
 

00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:03.270
medicine had chapters on polio myelitis
so this is a handwritten hand-drawn

00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280
so this is a handwritten hand-drawn
 

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:06.250
so this is a handwritten hand-drawn
figure from that time and what we're

00:42:06.250 --> 00:42:06.260
figure from that time and what we're
 

00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:07.630
figure from that time and what we're
looking at here is a time course of

00:42:07.630 --> 00:42:07.640
looking at here is a time course of
 

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:10.000
looking at here is a time course of
polio and various things that are going

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:10.010
polio and various things that are going
 

00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:12.490
polio and various things that are going
on so here's the time up here the

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:12.500
on so here's the time up here the
 

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.500
on so here's the time up here the
different phases of infection we're

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:14.510
different phases of infection we're
 

00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:16.330
different phases of infection we're
looking at temperature here so you can

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:16.340
looking at temperature here so you can
 

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.430
looking at temperature here so you can
see so here's exposure to the virus

00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440
see so here's exposure to the virus
 

00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:20.470
see so here's exposure to the virus
after about a seven day incubation

00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480
after about a seven day incubation
 

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.750
after about a seven day incubation
period we have a spike of temperature

00:42:22.750 --> 00:42:22.760
period we have a spike of temperature
 

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:26.260
period we have a spike of temperature
headache sore throat nausea nonspecific

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:26.270
headache sore throat nausea nonspecific
 

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:28.270
headache sore throat nausea nonspecific
symptoms of a virus infection caused by

00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280
symptoms of a virus infection caused by
 

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.060
symptoms of a virus infection caused by
cytokine production most of the people

00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:31.070
cytokine production most of the people
 

00:42:31.070 --> 00:42:34.180
cytokine production most of the people
get well and they go on and they're fine

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.190
get well and they go on and they're fine
 

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:37.570
get well and they go on and they're fine
but 1% of those individuals the virus

00:42:37.570 --> 00:42:37.580
but 1% of those individuals the virus
 

00:42:37.580 --> 00:42:40.210
but 1% of those individuals the virus
then remains in them that you get

00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:40.220
then remains in them that you get
 

00:42:40.220 --> 00:42:42.250
then remains in them that you get
another spike in temperature accompanied

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:42.260
another spike in temperature accompanied
 

00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:45.160
another spike in temperature accompanied
by stiffness pain and paralysis between

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:45.170
by stiffness pain and paralysis between
 

00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:47.770
by stiffness pain and paralysis between
day ten and fifteen so one percent of

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:47.780
day ten and fifteen so one percent of
 

00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:49.690
day ten and fifteen so one percent of
infection as a result in invasion of the

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:49.700
infection as a result in invasion of the
 

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.120
infection as a result in invasion of the
CNS and you get the paralytic disease

00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.130
CNS and you get the paralytic disease
 

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:54.970
CNS and you get the paralytic disease
and look at the virus production so

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:54.980
and look at the virus production so
 

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:57.670
and look at the virus production so
here's virus and the feces so that it

00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680
here's virus and the feces so that it
 

00:42:57.680 --> 00:42:59.920
here's virus and the feces so that it
peaks at about the first time of

00:42:59.920 --> 00:42:59.930
peaks at about the first time of
 

00:42:59.930 --> 00:43:02.740
peaks at about the first time of
temperature here a day after day seven

00:43:02.740 --> 00:43:02.750
temperature here a day after day seven
 

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:04.780
temperature here a day after day seven
and then it continues for a long period

00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:04.790
and then it continues for a long period
 

00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:06.490
and then it continues for a long period
of time so you excrete virus in the

00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:06.500
of time so you excrete virus in the
 

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:09.580
of time so you excrete virus in the
feces for over a month whether you have

00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:09.590
feces for over a month whether you have
 

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:12.010
feces for over a month whether you have
paralysis or not so that's how you

00:43:12.010 --> 00:43:12.020
paralysis or not so that's how you
 

00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:15.760
paralysis or not so that's how you
spread the virus to others

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:15.770
spread the virus to others
 

00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:19.270
spread the virus to others
here is another graph of virus in the

00:43:19.270 --> 00:43:19.280
here is another graph of virus in the
 

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:21.580
here is another graph of virus in the
blood and antibody just to show you that

00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:21.590
blood and antibody just to show you that
 

00:43:21.590 --> 00:43:23.800
blood and antibody just to show you that
here's the initial peak of virus that

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:23.810
here's the initial peak of virus that
 

00:43:23.810 --> 00:43:25.810
here's the initial peak of virus that
cord sides with that first bout of

00:43:25.810 --> 00:43:25.820
cord sides with that first bout of
 

00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.930
cord sides with that first bout of
nonspecific symptoms and then it goes

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:28.940
nonspecific symptoms and then it goes
 

00:43:28.940 --> 00:43:30.730
nonspecific symptoms and then it goes
down on its own and the antibody comes

00:43:30.730 --> 00:43:30.740
down on its own and the antibody comes
 

00:43:30.740 --> 00:43:33.370
down on its own and the antibody comes
up much later so that is the antibody is

00:43:33.370 --> 00:43:33.380
up much later so that is the antibody is
 

00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:35.830
up much later so that is the antibody is
not responsible for clearing that virus

00:43:35.830 --> 00:43:35.840
not responsible for clearing that virus
 

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.110
not responsible for clearing that virus
and then virus in the central nervous

00:43:38.110 --> 00:43:38.120
and then virus in the central nervous
 

00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:40.480
and then virus in the central nervous
system is shown on the bottom just after

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:40.490
system is shown on the bottom just after
 

00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:43.720
system is shown on the bottom just after
day ten virus goes up in the CNS and it

00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:43.730
day ten virus goes up in the CNS and it
 

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.240
day ten virus goes up in the CNS and it
Peaks at the time of paralysis so this

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:46.250
Peaks at the time of paralysis so this
 

00:43:46.250 --> 00:43:47.980
Peaks at the time of paralysis so this
only happens in individuals who have

00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:47.990
only happens in individuals who have
 

00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:52.630
only happens in individuals who have
paralytic symptoms yeah

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:52.640
 
 

00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:56.120
 
now these are these are people who add

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:56.130
now these are these are people who add
 

00:43:56.130 --> 00:43:58.820
now these are these are people who add
polio in the 50s you had thousands of

00:43:58.820 --> 00:43:58.830
polio in the 50s you had thousands of
 

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.670
polio in the 50s you had thousands of
people with polio in the u.s. so you

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680
people with polio in the u.s. so you
 

00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:03.530
people with polio in the u.s. so you
could take specimens you don't give them

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540
could take specimens you don't give them
 

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:05.090
could take specimens you don't give them
polio but they got infected and you

00:44:05.090 --> 00:44:05.100
polio but they got infected and you
 

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:07.880
polio but they got infected and you
could take serum and you could take CSF

00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:07.890
could take serum and you could take CSF
 

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:10.640
could take serum and you could take CSF
to look for virus in the CNS so all

00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:10.650
to look for virus in the CNS so all
 

00:44:10.650 --> 00:44:12.770
to look for virus in the CNS so all
these things you can sample feces serum

00:44:12.770 --> 00:44:12.780
these things you can sample feces serum
 

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:15.380
these things you can sample feces serum
you take the temperature so these are

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:15.390
you take the temperature so these are
 

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.030
you take the temperature so these are
natural infections you can't do this

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040
natural infections you can't do this
 

00:44:17.040 --> 00:44:28.430
natural infections you can't do this
anymore because we don't have it yes so

00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440
anymore because we don't have it yes so
 

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:32.000
anymore because we don't have it yes so
sometimes in family situations when one

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:32.010
sometimes in family situations when one
 

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.670
sometimes in family situations when one
child had polio you could roughly

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680
child had polio you could roughly
 

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.380
child had polio you could roughly
estimate when the others were infected

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:36.390
estimate when the others were infected
 

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.580
estimate when the others were infected
because they would they would be brought

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:37.590
because they would they would be brought
 

00:44:37.590 --> 00:44:40.400
because they would they would be brought
in to the hospital sometime later and

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:40.410
in to the hospital sometime later and
 

00:44:40.410 --> 00:44:41.930
in to the hospital sometime later and
you could do a history and find out when

00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940
you could do a history and find out when
 

00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:46.870
you could do a history and find out when
the other child was infected so a nice

00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880
the other child was infected so a nice
 

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.370
the other child was infected so a nice
summary of all of the whole time course

00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380
summary of all of the whole time course
 

00:44:49.380 --> 00:44:51.350
summary of all of the whole time course
of polio the pathogenesis as I said

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:51.360
of polio the pathogenesis as I said
 

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.540
of polio the pathogenesis as I said
humans are the only known reservoir it's

00:44:53.540 --> 00:44:53.550
humans are the only known reservoir it's
 

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.570
humans are the only known reservoir it's
spread by fecal oral transmission it's

00:44:56.570 --> 00:44:56.580
spread by fecal oral transmission it's
 

00:44:56.580 --> 00:44:59.240
spread by fecal oral transmission it's
also a seasonal infection in temperate

00:44:59.240 --> 00:44:59.250
also a seasonal infection in temperate
 

00:44:59.250 --> 00:45:00.920
also a seasonal infection in temperate
climates it Peaks during the warm months

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:00.930
climates it Peaks during the warm months
 

00:45:00.930 --> 00:45:04.040
climates it Peaks during the warm months
we're not sure why that probably has to

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:04.050
we're not sure why that probably has to
 

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:06.050
we're not sure why that probably has to
do with children being outside and

00:45:06.050 --> 00:45:06.060
do with children being outside and
 

00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:07.460
do with children being outside and
playing with one another during this

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:07.470
playing with one another during this
 

00:45:07.470 --> 00:45:10.670
playing with one another during this
time there is a complication if you have

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:10.680
time there is a complication if you have
 

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:14.330
time there is a complication if you have
paralytic polio you may get something

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:14.340
paralytic polio you may get something
 

00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.670
paralytic polio you may get something
called post-polio syndrome which happens

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:16.680
called post-polio syndrome which happens
 

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.280
called post-polio syndrome which happens
30 or 40 years after the original the

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:19.290
30 or 40 years after the original the
 

00:45:19.290 --> 00:45:21.050
30 or 40 years after the original the
initial paralysis and I should say that

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:21.060
initial paralysis and I should say that
 

00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.750
initial paralysis and I should say that
many individuals can be rehabilitated

00:45:23.750 --> 00:45:23.760
many individuals can be rehabilitated
 

00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:27.530
many individuals can be rehabilitated
from having polio paralysis you can have

00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540
from having polio paralysis you can have
 

00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.520
from having polio paralysis you can have
your limb function restored by therapy

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:30.530
your limb function restored by therapy
 

00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:33.290
your limb function restored by therapy
sometimes the virus does replicate in

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:33.300
sometimes the virus does replicate in
 

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.510
sometimes the virus does replicate in
respiratory control centers and you have

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520
respiratory control centers and you have
 

00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:38.450
respiratory control centers and you have
respiratory failure that that would get

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:38.460

you inhaled the virus in a aerosol it

00:49:31.810 --> 00:49:31.820
you inhaled the virus in a aerosol it
 

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:34.150
you inhaled the virus in a aerosol it
multiplies in your respiratory

00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:34.160
multiplies in your respiratory
 

00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:36.530
multiplies in your respiratory
epithelium and then enters the

00:49:36.530 --> 00:49:36.540
epithelium and then enters the
 

00:49:36.540 --> 00:49:38.660
epithelium and then enters the
bloodstream so it's not like influenza

00:49:38.660 --> 00:49:38.670
bloodstream so it's not like influenza
 

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:40.760
bloodstream so it's not like influenza
where it remains in the respiratory

00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:40.770
where it remains in the respiratory
 

00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.650
where it remains in the respiratory
tract this virus enters the bloodstream

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:42.660
tract this virus enters the bloodstream
 

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:46.430
tract this virus enters the bloodstream
and then spreads to other organs so it

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:46.440
and then spreads to other organs so it
 

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:48.890
and then spreads to other organs so it
has a longer incubation period as a

00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900
has a longer incubation period as a
 

00:49:48.900 --> 00:49:51.800
has a longer incubation period as a
consequence there is then a secondary

00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:51.810
consequence there is then a secondary
 

00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:54.410
consequence there is then a secondary
viremia remember the virus multiplies in

00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:54.420
viremia remember the virus multiplies in
 

00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:56.240
viremia remember the virus multiplies in
these organs initially then there's a

00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:56.250
these organs initially then there's a
 

00:49:56.250 --> 00:49:58.670
these organs initially then there's a
secondary viremia and that brings virus

00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680
secondary viremia and that brings virus
 

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.580
secondary viremia and that brings virus
to the skin where it causes a rash and

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:01.590
to the skin where it causes a rash and
 

00:50:01.590 --> 00:50:03.580
to the skin where it causes a rash and
the rash is a delayed type

00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:03.590
the rash is a delayed type
 

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:07.040
the rash is a delayed type
hypersensitivity reaction it is a virus

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:07.050
hypersensitivity reaction it is a virus
 

00:50:07.050 --> 00:50:09.170
hypersensitivity reaction it is a virus
multiplying in cells and T cells coming

00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180
multiplying in cells and T cells coming
 

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:10.610
multiplying in cells and T cells coming
in to try and clear the infection they

00:50:10.610 --> 00:50:10.620
in to try and clear the infection they
 

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:11.450
in to try and clear the infection they
make the rash

00:50:11.450 --> 00:50:11.460
make the rash
 

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.910
make the rash
there are also rare complications of

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920
there are also rare complications of
 

00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.040
there are also rare complications of
measles that we'll talk briefly about it

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:16.050
measles that we'll talk briefly about it
 

00:50:16.050 --> 00:50:18.050
measles that we'll talk briefly about it
can enter your brain and cause

00:50:18.050 --> 00:50:18.060
can enter your brain and cause
 

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:21.560
can enter your brain and cause
encephalitis or it can cause a very

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:21.570
encephalitis or it can cause a very
 

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:24.550
encephalitis or it can cause a very
interesting disease subacute sclerosing

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:24.560
interesting disease subacute sclerosing
 

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:29.330
interesting disease subacute sclerosing
pan encephalitis SS PE and this is

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:29.340
pan encephalitis SS PE and this is
 

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.170
pan encephalitis SS PE and this is
something that happens

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:30.180
something that happens
 

00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:31.970
something that happens
many years after you get measles so a

00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980
many years after you get measles so a
 

00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.920
many years after you get measles so a
child will get measles they recover

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:33.930
child will get measles they recover
 

00:50:33.930 --> 00:50:36.620
child will get measles they recover
they're fine 30 years later they start

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:36.630
they're fine 30 years later they start
 

00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:38.740
they're fine 30 years later they start
to have this new progressive

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:38.750
to have this new progressive
 

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:40.010
to have this new progressive
neurodegeneration

00:50:40.010 --> 00:50:40.020
neurodegeneration
 

00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.660
neurodegeneration
they eventually die it's a hundred

00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:41.670
they eventually die it's a hundred
 

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:43.670
they eventually die it's a hundred
percent fatal and it's caused by the

00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:43.680
percent fatal and it's caused by the
 

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:48.170
percent fatal and it's caused by the
initial measles infection so here's a

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180
initial measles infection so here's a
 

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:50.180
initial measles infection so here's a
timeline of some of these events you

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:50.190
timeline of some of these events you
 

00:50:50.190 --> 00:50:53.270
timeline of some of these events you
have infection here there's a primary

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280
have infection here there's a primary
 

00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.130
have infection here there's a primary
very Mia the virus spreads to other

00:50:57.130 --> 00:50:57.140
very Mia the virus spreads to other
 

00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:00.460
very Mia the virus spreads to other
tissues so that's the incubation period

00:51:00.460 --> 00:51:00.470
tissues so that's the incubation period
 

00:51:00.470 --> 00:51:02.960
tissues so that's the incubation period
then there's what we call a prodromal

00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:02.970
then there's what we call a prodromal
 

00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.760
then there's what we call a prodromal
period which happens just which is the

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:04.770
period which happens just which is the
 

00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:08.240
period which happens just which is the
period just before the rash so the rash

00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:08.250
period just before the rash so the rash
 

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:11.000
period just before the rash so the rash
is occurring at around day 14 so it's a

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:11.010
is occurring at around day 14 so it's a
 

00:51:11.010 --> 00:51:12.950
is occurring at around day 14 so it's a
two-week incubation period and you can

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960
two-week incubation period and you can
 

00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:15.020
two-week incubation period and you can
see that that's plenty of time for these

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:15.030
see that that's plenty of time for these
 

00:51:15.030 --> 00:51:18.080
see that that's plenty of time for these
kids to shed virus and pass it on to

00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:18.090
kids to shed virus and pass it on to
 

00:51:18.090 --> 00:51:20.990
kids to shed virus and pass it on to
other people at the onset of rash you

00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:21.000
other people at the onset of rash you
 

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.550
other people at the onset of rash you
have antibody produced and eventually

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:22.560
have antibody produced and eventually
 

00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.980
have antibody produced and eventually
recovery so uncomplicated measles is

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:27.990
recovery so uncomplicated measles is
 

00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:31.280
recovery so uncomplicated measles is
associated with a high fever cough and

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:31.290
associated with a high fever cough and
 

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:34.420
associated with a high fever cough and
symptoms of a cold runny nose

00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:34.430
symptoms of a cold runny nose
 

00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:38.210
symptoms of a cold runny nose
conjunctivitis and cop lick spots these

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:38.220
conjunctivitis and cop lick spots these
 

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.820
conjunctivitis and cop lick spots these
are white spots in the mouth which are

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:40.830
are white spots in the mouth which are
 

00:51:40.830 --> 00:51:42.680
are white spots in the mouth which are
shown on the bottom here I'm not sure

00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:42.690
shown on the bottom here I'm not sure
 

00:51:42.690 --> 00:51:45.200
shown on the bottom here I'm not sure
you'll be able to see this but in the

00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:45.210
you'll be able to see this but in the
 

00:51:45.210 --> 00:51:47.410
you'll be able to see this but in the
day when measles was rampant this was

00:51:47.410 --> 00:51:47.420
day when measles was rampant this was
 

00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.210
day when measles was rampant this was
diagnostic for measles if the kid had

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220
diagnostic for measles if the kid had
 

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.160
diagnostic for measles if the kid had
these white spots that right down here

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:52.170
these white spots that right down here
 

00:51:52.170 --> 00:51:54.920
these white spots that right down here
tiny white spots on the mucosa inside

00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:54.930
tiny white spots on the mucosa inside
 

00:51:54.930 --> 00:51:57.260
tiny white spots on the mucosa inside
the cheek was pretty much clear that was

00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:57.270
the cheek was pretty much clear that was
 

00:51:57.270 --> 00:51:59.420
the cheek was pretty much clear that was
measles the rash is all over the body

00:51:59.420 --> 00:51:59.430
measles the rash is all over the body
 

00:51:59.430 --> 00:52:01.940
measles the rash is all over the body
face extremities trunk so this is the

00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:01.950
face extremities trunk so this is the
 

00:52:01.950 --> 00:52:03.980
face extremities trunk so this is the
delayed type hypersensitivity rash

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:03.990
delayed type hypersensitivity rash
 

00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:06.940
delayed type hypersensitivity rash
caused by virus infection

00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:06.950
caused by virus infection
 

00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:09.850
caused by virus infection
this virus too has complications

00:52:09.850 --> 00:52:09.860
this virus too has complications
 

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:12.320
this virus too has complications
encephalitis as I said the virus can get

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:12.330
encephalitis as I said the virus can get
 

00:52:12.330 --> 00:52:16.130
encephalitis as I said the virus can get
into your CNS one in 3,000 cases so

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:16.140
into your CNS one in 3,000 cases so
 

00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.870
into your CNS one in 3,000 cases so
3,000 cases of measles one of those

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:17.880
3,000 cases of measles one of those
 

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.920
3,000 cases of measles one of those
encephalitis sspe many years later and

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:21.930
encephalitis sspe many years later and
 

00:52:21.930 --> 00:52:24.290
encephalitis sspe many years later and
then as we talked about a few lectures

00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300
then as we talked about a few lectures
 

00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:26.480
then as we talked about a few lectures
ago this virus causes immunosuppression

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:26.490
ago this virus causes immunosuppression
 

00:52:26.490 --> 00:52:28.730
ago this virus causes immunosuppression
so as a consequence you don't having a

00:52:28.730 --> 00:52:28.740
so as a consequence you don't having a
 

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:30.260
so as a consequence you don't having a
good immune response against other

00:52:30.260 --> 00:52:30.270
good immune response against other
 

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:32.840
good immune response against other
pathogens that you might encounter so

00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:32.850
pathogens that you might encounter so
 

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.060
pathogens that you might encounter so
you get secondary infections as a

00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:35.070
you get secondary infections as a
 

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:37.790
you get secondary infections as a
consequence of having measles and that's

00:52:37.790 --> 00:52:37.800
consequence of having measles and that's
 

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.500
consequence of having measles and that's
the main cause of death in third-world

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:39.510
the main cause of death in third-world
 

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:42.140
the main cause of death in third-world
children who get measles they get

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:42.150
children who get measles they get
 

00:52:42.150 --> 00:52:43.550
children who get measles they get
immunosuppressed and they get other

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:43.560
immunosuppressed and they get other
 

00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:44.570
immunosuppressed and they get other

parasites or bacteria so how do you

00:52:47.990 --> 00:52:48.000
parasites or bacteria so how do you
 

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.870
parasites or bacteria so how do you
prevent measles well in the US before a

thing they can wreak havoc and one of
 

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:15.849
thing they can wreak havoc and one of
them is is this we stop transmission of

00:53:15.849 --> 00:53:15.859
them is is this we stop transmission of
 

00:53:15.859 --> 00:53:18.800
them is is this we stop transmission of
measles in the u.s. by 2000 by using the

refused to immunize their kids because

00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:00.090
refused to immunize their kids because
 

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.180
refused to immunize their kids because
of this and there are always outbreaks

00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:02.190
of this and there are always outbreaks
 

00:54:02.190 --> 00:54:04.040
of this and there are always outbreaks
of measles there have been quite a few

00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:04.050
of measles there have been quite a few
 

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:06.560

in the UK and Ireland and then people

00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:06.570
in the UK and Ireland and then people
 

00:54:06.570 --> 00:54:09.109
in the UK and Ireland and then people
traveling bring them to the US and they

00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119
traveling bring them to the US and they
 

00:54:09.119 --> 00:54:11.150
traveling bring them to the US and they
cause outbreaks here in the US and under

00:54:11.150 --> 00:54:11.160
cause outbreaks here in the US and under
 

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.210
cause outbreaks here in the US and under
under immunized populations so we don't

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:14.220
under immunized populations so we don't
 

00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.040
under immunized populations so we don't
have measles circulating but it can be

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:16.050
have measles circulating but it can be
 

00:54:16.050 --> 00:54:18.560
have measles circulating but it can be
brought in from Europe where there are

large outbreaks so here's a graph
 

00:54:22.050 --> 00:54:23.380
large outbreaks so here's a graph
showing you the impact of the vaccine

00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:23.390
showing you the impact of the vaccine
 

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:26.000

the vaccine licensed in the 60s and you
 

00:54:31.470 --> 00:54:33.050
the vaccine licensed in the 60s and you
can see it eliminated measles now we

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:33.060
can see it eliminated measles now we
 

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:34.670

don't have anymore circulation of
measles virus so this is measles disease

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:37.170
measles virus so this is measles disease
 

00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:39.800

00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:24.019
distribution of rotavirus deaths just
 

00:57:24.019 --> 00:57:26.829
distribution of rotavirus deaths just
recently you see there's no more in in

00:57:26.829 --> 00:57:26.839
recently you see there's no more in in
 

00:57:26.839 --> 00:57:29.199
recently you see there's no more in in
the developed countries in the US just

00:57:29.199 --> 00:57:29.209
the developed countries in the US just
 

00:57:29.209 --> 00:57:31.679
the developed countries in the US just
very little in Europe Russia Australia

00:57:31.679 --> 00:57:31.689
very little in Europe Russia Australia
 

00:57:31.689 --> 00:57:35.919
very little in Europe Russia Australia
but Asia Africa in even South America

00:57:35.919 --> 00:57:35.929
but Asia Africa in even South America
 

00:57:35.929 --> 00:57:38.890
but Asia Africa in even South America
each dot i think is 500 deaths so you

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:38.900
each dot i think is 500 deaths so you
 

00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.479
each dot i think is 500 deaths so you
can see there's a huge burden of infant

00:57:40.479 --> 00:57:40.489
can see there's a huge burden of infant
 

00:57:40.489 --> 00:57:42.900
can see there's a huge burden of infant
mortality caused by this and it's really

00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:42.910
mortality caused by this and it's really
 

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:45.489
mortality caused by this and it's really
mainly because they cannot get these

00:57:45.489 --> 00:57:45.499
mainly because they cannot get these
 

00:57:45.499 --> 00:57:48.219
mainly because they cannot get these
infants intravenous fluids rapidly

00:57:48.219 --> 00:57:48.229
infants intravenous fluids rapidly
 

00:57:48.229 --> 00:57:51.519
infants intravenous fluids rapidly
enough so this is what the virus looks

00:57:51.519 --> 00:57:51.529
enough so this is what the virus looks
 

00:57:51.529 --> 00:57:54.279
enough so this is what the virus looks
like it's a typical real virus it has an

00:57:54.279 --> 00:57:54.289
like it's a typical real virus it has an
 

00:57:54.289 --> 00:57:56.529
like it's a typical real virus it has an
icosahedral shell in fact it has two of

00:57:56.529 --> 00:57:56.539
icosahedral shell in fact it has two of
 

00:57:56.539 --> 00:57:59.019
icosahedral shell in fact it has two of
them it has two icosahedral shells one

00:57:59.019 --> 00:57:59.029
them it has two icosahedral shells one
 

00:57:59.029 --> 00:58:01.329
them it has two icosahedral shells one
inside and one outside and they are

00:58:01.329 --> 00:58:01.339
inside and one outside and they are
 

00:58:01.339 --> 00:58:04.630
inside and one outside and they are
viral glycoproteins in this shell

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640
viral glycoproteins in this shell
 

00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:07.239
viral glycoproteins in this shell
they're called vp4 and then the shell

00:58:07.239 --> 00:58:07.249
they're called vp4 and then the shell
 

00:58:07.249 --> 00:58:09.159
they're called vp4 and then the shell
itself is vp7 and i point that out

00:58:09.159 --> 00:58:09.169
itself is vp7 and i point that out
 

00:58:09.169 --> 00:58:10.749
itself is vp7 and i point that out
because those are two of the more

00:58:10.749 --> 00:58:10.759
because those are two of the more
 

00:58:10.759 --> 00:58:13.269
because those are two of the more
important proteins to make antibodies

00:58:13.269 --> 00:58:13.279
important proteins to make antibodies
 

00:58:13.279 --> 00:58:14.679
important proteins to make antibodies
against if you want to be protected

00:58:14.679 --> 00:58:14.689
against if you want to be protected
 

00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:18.189
against if you want to be protected
against these viruses inside is the

00:58:18.189 --> 00:58:18.199
against these viruses inside is the
 

00:58:18.199 --> 00:58:21.279
against these viruses inside is the
double-stranded RNA genome when these

00:58:21.279 --> 00:58:21.289
double-stranded RNA genome when these
 

00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.169
double-stranded RNA genome when these
viruses were first seen in those

00:58:23.169 --> 00:58:23.179
viruses were first seen in those
 

00:58:23.179 --> 00:58:25.959
viruses were first seen in those
biopsies of intestinal mucosa this is

00:58:25.959 --> 00:58:25.969
biopsies of intestinal mucosa this is
 

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:28.089
biopsies of intestinal mucosa this is
what they looked like and the guy who

00:58:28.089 --> 00:58:28.099
what they looked like and the guy who
 

00:58:28.099 --> 00:58:29.679
what they looked like and the guy who
discovered them said oh they look like

00:58:29.679 --> 00:58:29.689
discovered them said oh they look like
 

00:58:29.689 --> 00:58:31.390
discovered them said oh they look like
little wheels and that's why he called

00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:31.400
little wheels and that's why he called
 

00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.249
little wheels and that's why he called
them rotaviruses so you can see here

00:58:33.249 --> 00:58:33.259
them rotaviruses so you can see here
 

00:58:33.259 --> 00:58:37.689
them rotaviruses so you can see here
they very symmetrical pathogenesis it's

00:58:37.689 --> 00:58:37.699
they very symmetrical pathogenesis it's
 

00:58:37.699 --> 00:58:39.909
they very symmetrical pathogenesis it's
transmitted by fecal oral contamination

00:58:39.909 --> 00:58:39.919
transmitted by fecal oral contamination
 

00:58:39.919 --> 00:58:41.649
transmitted by fecal oral contamination
you shed the virus and your feces and

00:58:41.649 --> 00:58:41.659
you shed the virus and your feces and
 

00:58:41.659 --> 00:58:44.169
you shed the virus and your feces and
someone else picks it up you don't need

00:58:44.169 --> 00:58:44.179
someone else picks it up you don't need
 

00:58:44.179 --> 00:58:48.309
someone else picks it up you don't need
very much virus to infect you ten virus

00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319
very much virus to infect you ten virus
 

00:58:48.319 --> 00:58:50.079
very much virus to infect you ten virus
particles are enough to cause

00:58:50.079 --> 00:58:50.089
particles are enough to cause
 

00:58:50.089 --> 00:58:54.729
particles are enough to cause
gastroenteritis and as I said young

00:58:54.729 --> 00:58:54.739
gastroenteritis and as I said young
 

00:58:54.739 --> 00:58:56.739
gastroenteritis and as I said young
infants are at risk for dehydration you

00:58:56.739 --> 00:58:56.749
infants are at risk for dehydration you
 

00:58:56.749 --> 00:58:59.679
infants are at risk for dehydration you
do get infected over and over again as

00:58:59.679 --> 00:58:59.689
do get infected over and over again as
 

00:58:59.689 --> 00:59:02.439
do get infected over and over again as
you age but the subsequent infections

00:59:02.439 --> 00:59:02.449
you age but the subsequent infections
 

00:59:02.449 --> 00:59:04.239
you age but the subsequent infections
are milder and eventually you don't get

00:59:04.239 --> 00:59:04.249
are milder and eventually you don't get
 

00:59:04.249 --> 00:59:06.789
are milder and eventually you don't get
disease because you have antibodies that

00:59:06.789 --> 00:59:06.799
disease because you have antibodies that
 

00:59:06.799 --> 00:59:09.339
disease because you have antibodies that
build up against these viruses now you

00:59:09.339 --> 00:59:09.349
build up against these viruses now you
 

00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:11.890
build up against these viruses now you
can be infected and you can shed virus

00:59:11.890 --> 00:59:11.900
can be infected and you can shed virus
 

00:59:11.900 --> 00:59:13.419
can be infected and you can shed virus
even though you don't have symptoms and

00:59:13.419 --> 00:59:13.429
even though you don't have symptoms and
 

00:59:13.429 --> 00:59:15.640
even though you don't have symptoms and
so you become a carrier of rotavirus and

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:15.650
so you become a carrier of rotavirus and
 

00:59:15.650 --> 00:59:17.469
so you become a carrier of rotavirus and
that's one of the main ways that it's

00:59:17.469 --> 00:59:17.479
that's one of the main ways that it's
 

00:59:17.479 --> 00:59:21.159
that's one of the main ways that it's
spread in in larger situations you've

00:59:21.159 --> 00:59:21.169
spread in in larger situations you've
 

00:59:21.169 --> 00:59:23.199
spread in in larger situations you've
shed a lot of virus in the feces ten to

00:59:23.199 --> 00:59:23.209
shed a lot of virus in the feces ten to
 

00:59:23.209 --> 00:59:24.310
shed a lot of virus in the feces ten to
the eighth to ten to the

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:24.320
the eighth to ten to the
 

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.340
the eighth to ten to the
tenth particles per milliliter so just

00:59:27.340 --> 00:59:27.350
tenth particles per milliliter so just
 

00:59:27.350 --> 00:59:30.610
tenth particles per milliliter so just
think of all that 65 million gallons is

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:30.620
think of all that 65 million gallons is
 

00:59:30.620 --> 00:59:34.030
think of all that 65 million gallons is
that liters per minute and multiply it

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:34.040
that liters per minute and multiply it
 

00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:36.100
that liters per minute and multiply it
times ten to the eighth to ten to the

00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:36.110
times ten to the eighth to ten to the
 

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:40.270
times ten to the eighth to ten to the
tenth particles lot of virus there how

00:59:40.270 --> 00:59:40.280
tenth particles lot of virus there how
 

00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.690
tenth particles lot of virus there how
do you get it contaminated hands and

00:59:42.690 --> 00:59:42.700
do you get it contaminated hands and
 

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.940
do you get it contaminated hands and
foods you have a food handler who has an

00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:45.950
foods you have a food handler who has an
 

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:48.430
foods you have a food handler who has an
infection with no symptoms if he or she

00:59:48.430 --> 00:59:48.440
infection with no symptoms if he or she
 

00:59:48.440 --> 00:59:50.800
infection with no symptoms if he or she
had symptoms they should stay home but

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:50.810
had symptoms they should stay home but
 

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:52.330
had symptoms they should stay home but
they have no symptoms they're shedding

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:52.340
they have no symptoms they're shedding
 

00:59:52.340 --> 00:59:54.130
they have no symptoms they're shedding
virus because they've had many

00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:54.140
virus because they've had many
 

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.630
virus because they've had many
infections over the years so it's

00:59:55.630 --> 00:59:55.640
infections over the years so it's
 

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.970
infections over the years so it's
asymptomatic and they have virus on

00:59:57.970 --> 00:59:57.980
asymptomatic and they have virus on
 

00:59:57.980 --> 01:00:00.100
asymptomatic and they have virus on
their hands and they contaminate the

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:00.110
their hands and they contaminate the
 

01:00:00.110 --> 01:00:01.390
their hands and they contaminate the
food you know all the signs and the

01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400
food you know all the signs and the
 

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:03.490

restaurants employees must wash their
 

01:00:05.630 --> 01:00:07.690
restaurants employees must wash their
hands the motivation was in part

01:00:07.690 --> 01:00:07.700

rotavirus there are other viruses that

01:00:09.130 --> 01:00:09.140
rotavirus there are other viruses that
 

01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:11.320
rotavirus there are other viruses that
cause gastroenteritis as well because we

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:11.330
cause gastroenteritis as well because we
 

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:12.730
cause gastroenteritis as well because we
know a lot of these individuals are

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:12.740
know a lot of these individuals are
 

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.980
know a lot of these individuals are
asymptomatic shedders and so if they

01:00:14.980 --> 01:00:14.990
asymptomatic shedders and so if they
 

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.360
asymptomatic shedders and so if they
wash their hands you can really cut down

01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:16.370
wash their hands you can really cut down
 

01:00:16.370 --> 01:00:19.420
wash their hands you can really cut down
on the burden of infection these viruses

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:19.430
on the burden of infection these viruses
 

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.580
on the burden of infection these viruses
are also quite stable so they will last

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:21.590
are also quite stable so they will last
 

01:00:21.590 --> 01:00:23.410
are also quite stable so they will last
on environmental surfaces and that's

01:00:23.410 --> 01:00:23.420
on environmental surfaces and that's
 

01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:26.770
on environmental surfaces and that's
another way you can pick them up the

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:26.780
another way you can pick them up the
 

01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:29.590
another way you can pick them up the

vomiting followed by four to eight days
 

01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:49.030
vomiting followed by four to eight days
of diarrhea sound good but then you get

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040
of diarrhea sound good but then you get
 

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.390
of diarrhea sound good but then you get
better

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400

for the most part recovery is usually

01:00:51.670 --> 01:00:51.680
for the most part recovery is usually
 

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.480
for the most part recovery is usually
complete unless you don't take fluids I

got an email last week from someone she

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:57.170
got an email last week from someone she
 

01:00:57.170 --> 01:00:59.440
got an email last week from someone she
said my husband is vomiting as diarrhea

01:00:59.440 --> 01:00:59.450
said my husband is vomiting as diarrhea
 

01:00:59.450 --> 01:01:01.450
said my husband is vomiting as diarrhea
and he doesn't know what to do she said

01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:01.460
and he doesn't know what to do she said
 

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:03.850
and he doesn't know what to do she said
I think he has that roto virus and I

01:01:03.850 --> 01:01:03.860
I think he has that roto virus and I
 

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.830
I think he has that roto virus and I
said he might but just have him drink a

01:01:05.830 --> 01:01:05.840
said he might but just have him drink a
 

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:06.400
said he might but just have him drink a
lot of water

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:06.410
lot of water
 

01:01:06.410 --> 01:01:07.720
lot of water
she said should I go to the doctor I

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:11.450
antiviral they just have to drink a lot
 

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:14.110
antiviral they just have to drink a lot
of water and you'll be fine so how does

01:01:14.110 --> 01:01:14.120
of water and you'll be fine so how does
 

01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:16.480
of water and you'll be fine so how does
it work you ingest contaminated food or

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:16.490
it work you ingest contaminated food or
 

01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:17.950
it work you ingest contaminated food or
water the virus goes into your

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960
water the virus goes into your
 

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.960
water the virus goes into your
intestinal tract and multiplies in the

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:19.970
intestinal tract and multiplies in the
 

01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.880
intestinal tract and multiplies in the
mucosal surfaces there and you can see

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:21.890
mucosal surfaces there and you can see
 

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:24.910
mucosal surfaces there and you can see
this is a section of intestinal villi

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:24.920
this is a section of intestinal villi
 

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.100
this is a section of intestinal villi
and these dark spots are where the virus

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:27.110
and these dark spots are where the virus
 

01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:30.280
and these dark spots are where the virus
is multiplying and that causes a fluid

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:30.290
is multiplying and that causes a fluid
 

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.990
is multiplying and that causes a fluid
imbalance in fact a couple of lectures

01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000

ago we talked about how this is one of

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:34.100
ago we talked about how this is one of
 

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.670
ago we talked about how this is one of
those viruses that makes a toxin it

01:01:36.670 --> 01:01:36.680
those viruses that makes a toxin it
 

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:37.930
those viruses that makes a toxin it
makes a toxin it

01:01:37.930 --> 01:01:37.940
makes a toxin it
 

01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:42.069
makes a toxin it
a protein called VP 4 and VP 4 probably

01:01:42.069 --> 01:01:42.079
a protein called VP 4 and VP 4 probably
 

01:01:42.079 --> 01:01:43.569
a protein called VP 4 and VP 4 probably
causes the diarrhea so here's a

01:01:43.569 --> 01:01:43.579
causes the diarrhea so here's a
 

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:45.250

epithelial cells the things I want to

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:48.380
epithelial cells the things I want to
 

01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:51.550
epithelial cells the things I want to
point out here are that the infected

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:51.560
point out here are that the infected
 

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:54.490
point out here are that the infected
cells produce cytokines that attract T

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:54.500
cells produce cytokines that attract T
 

01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:56.500
cells produce cytokines that attract T
cells and of course those cause

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:56.510
cells and of course those cause
 

01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.420
cells and of course those cause
intestinal cell damage as they try to

01:01:58.420 --> 01:01:58.430
intestinal cell damage as they try to
 

01:01:58.430 --> 01:02:00.970
intestinal cell damage as they try to
eliminate the infection in this cell

01:02:00.970 --> 01:02:00.980
eliminate the infection in this cell
 

01:02:00.980 --> 01:02:03.819
eliminate the infection in this cell
here you can see NS P 4 is being

01:02:03.819 --> 01:02:03.829
here you can see NS P 4 is being
 

01:02:03.829 --> 01:02:05.650
here you can see NS P 4 is being
produced that's the toxin produced by

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:05.660
produced that's the toxin produced by
 

01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:08.500
produced that's the toxin produced by
the virus it causes a excretion of

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:08.510
the virus it causes a excretion of
 

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:10.329
the virus it causes a excretion of
chloride and that leads to a fluid

01:02:10.329 --> 01:02:10.339
chloride and that leads to a fluid
 

01:02:10.339 --> 01:02:12.670
chloride and that leads to a fluid
imbalance giving you diarrhea there's

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:12.680
imbalance giving you diarrhea there's
 

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.859
imbalance giving you diarrhea there's
also some evidence that the virus

01:02:14.859 --> 01:02:14.869
also some evidence that the virus
 

01:02:14.869 --> 01:02:16.690
also some evidence that the virus
interacts in some way with the enteric

01:02:16.690 --> 01:02:16.700
interacts in some way with the enteric
 

01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:19.120
interacts in some way with the enteric
nervous system so this question mark

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:19.130
nervous system so this question mark
 

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:21.730
nervous system so this question mark
here might be the virus protein at SP 4

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:21.740
here might be the virus protein at SP 4
 

01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:24.760
here might be the virus protein at SP 4
it could be that NS p 4 interacting with

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:24.770
it could be that NS p 4 interacting with
 

01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:26.410
it could be that NS p 4 interacting with
this nervous system it also has a role

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:26.420
this nervous system it also has a role
 

01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:30.550
this nervous system it also has a role
in in diarrhea as well now there is

01:02:30.550 --> 01:02:30.560
in in diarrhea as well now there is
 

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:33.160
in in diarrhea as well now there is
there are a couple of vaccines against

01:02:33.160 --> 01:02:33.170
there are a couple of vaccines against
 

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:34.839
there are a couple of vaccines against
rotavirus because there's significant

01:02:34.839 --> 01:02:34.849
rotavirus because there's significant
 

01:02:34.849 --> 01:02:37.690
rotavirus because there's significant
pathogens the first one was called rota

01:02:37.690 --> 01:02:37.700
pathogens the first one was called rota
 

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:41.620
pathogens the first one was called rota
shield and it was a reassortant between

01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:41.630
shield and it was a reassortant between
 

01:02:41.630 --> 01:02:46.500
shield and it was a reassortant between
human and bovine sorry rhesus monkey

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:46.510
human and bovine sorry rhesus monkey
 

01:02:46.510 --> 01:02:49.569
human and bovine sorry rhesus monkey
rotaviruses was licensed in 1998 so they

01:02:49.569 --> 01:02:49.579
rotaviruses was licensed in 1998 so they
 

01:02:49.579 --> 01:02:52.300
rotaviruses was licensed in 1998 so they
start with a rhesus rotavirus and these

01:02:52.300 --> 01:02:52.310
start with a rhesus rotavirus and these
 

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:55.150
start with a rhesus rotavirus and these
viruses don't cause disease in people so

01:02:55.150 --> 01:02:55.160
viruses don't cause disease in people so
 

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:57.250
viruses don't cause disease in people so
you make reassortant of those rhesus

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:57.260
you make reassortant of those rhesus
 

01:02:57.260 --> 01:02:59.140
you make reassortant of those rhesus
viruses with human viruses and so you

01:02:59.140 --> 01:02:59.150
viruses with human viruses and so you
 

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:01.240
viruses with human viruses and so you
then select for viruses that have the

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:01.250
then select for viruses that have the
 

01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:03.670
then select for viruses that have the
human glycoproteins on the surface of

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:03.680
human glycoproteins on the surface of
 

01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:05.770
human glycoproteins on the surface of
the particle and all the other genes are

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:05.780
the particle and all the other genes are
 

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.510
the particle and all the other genes are
from the rhesus rotavirus so those

01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520
from the rhesus rotavirus so those
 

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.520
from the rhesus rotavirus so those
viruses you can ingest they will make

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:09.530
viruses you can ingest they will make
 

01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:11.170
viruses you can ingest they will make
antibodies against the human viral

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:11.180
antibodies against the human viral
 

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.599
antibodies against the human viral
proteins but you don't get sick okay

01:03:13.599 --> 01:03:13.609
proteins but you don't get sick okay
 

01:03:13.609 --> 01:03:15.760
proteins but you don't get sick okay
and these are just some of the

01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:15.770
and these are just some of the
 

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:17.290
and these are just some of the
reassortant that are used unfortunately

01:03:17.290 --> 01:03:17.300
reassortant that are used unfortunately
 

01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.599
reassortant that are used unfortunately
this was suspended a year after use

01:03:19.599 --> 01:03:19.609
this was suspended a year after use
 

01:03:19.609 --> 01:03:20.890
this was suspended a year after use
because there was some evidence that

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:20.900
because there was some evidence that
 

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:23.380
because there was some evidence that
this vaccine was causing in kids so you

01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:23.390
this vaccine was causing in kids so you
 

01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:25.420
this vaccine was causing in kids so you
give it to very young kids it was

01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:25.430
give it to very young kids it was
 

01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:26.920
give it to very young kids it was
causing intussusception so

01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:26.930
causing intussusception so
 

01:03:26.930 --> 01:03:29.319
causing intussusception so
intussusception is when your small

01:03:29.319 --> 01:03:29.329
intussusception is when your small
 

01:03:29.329 --> 01:03:32.160
intussusception is when your small
intestine Telescope's into the colon

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:32.170
intestine Telescope's into the colon
 

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:35.020
intestine Telescope's into the colon
alright so it's a natural complication

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:35.030
alright so it's a natural complication
 

01:03:35.030 --> 01:03:37.540
alright so it's a natural complication
of a rotavirus infection and there was

01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:37.550
of a rotavirus infection and there was
 

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:39.760
of a rotavirus infection and there was
some statistical evidence that it was

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:39.770
some statistical evidence that it was
 

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:42.250
some statistical evidence that it was
increasing in these individuals getting

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:42.260
increasing in these individuals getting
 

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:44.530
increasing in these individuals getting
this vaccine so they pulled it off the

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:44.540
this vaccine so they pulled it off the
 

01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:46.660
this vaccine so they pulled it off the
market it's not clear that in fact the

01:03:46.660 --> 01:03:46.670
market it's not clear that in fact the
 

01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:48.730
market it's not clear that in fact the
vaccine was at fault here at all it's a

01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:48.740
vaccine was at fault here at all it's a
 

01:03:48.740 --> 01:03:51.190
vaccine was at fault here at all it's a
big debate going on about this in fact

01:03:51.190 --> 01:03:51.200
big debate going on about this in fact
 

01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:51.490
big debate going on about this in fact
this

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:51.500
this
 

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:55.030
this
vaccine is being retested in other areas

01:03:55.030 --> 01:03:55.040
vaccine is being retested in other areas
 

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.060
vaccine is being retested in other areas
of the world so right now we then the

01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:58.070
of the world so right now we then the
 

01:03:58.070 --> 01:03:59.890
of the world so right now we then the
number of years later two other vaccines

01:03:59.890 --> 01:03:59.900
number of years later two other vaccines
 

01:03:59.900 --> 01:04:01.930
number of years later two other vaccines
were licensed and we're using these now

01:04:01.930 --> 01:04:01.940
were licensed and we're using these now
 

01:04:01.940 --> 01:04:04.420
were licensed and we're using these now
one of them is called roto tech it's a

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:04.430
one of them is called roto tech it's a
 

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:06.910
one of them is called roto tech it's a
reassortment reassortant between human

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:06.920
reassortment reassortant between human
 

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.510
reassortment reassortant between human
and bovine strains same logic as the

01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520
and bovine strains same logic as the
 

01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:12.700
and bovine strains same logic as the
rhesus human resource from the previous

01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:12.710
rhesus human resource from the previous
 

01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:16.390
rhesus human resource from the previous
vaccine so that's the rota Tech right

01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:16.400
vaccine so that's the rota Tech right
 

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.390
vaccine so that's the rota Tech right
here there are one two three four five

01:04:19.390 --> 01:04:19.400
here there are one two three four five
 

01:04:19.400 --> 01:04:22.599
here there are one two three four five
different reassortant and this is so you

01:04:22.599 --> 01:04:22.609
different reassortant and this is so you
 

01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:24.640
different reassortant and this is so you
cover all the different important sera

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:24.650
cover all the different important sera
 

01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:27.550
cover all the different important sera
groups and then there's another one

01:04:27.550 --> 01:04:27.560
groups and then there's another one
 

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:28.480
groups and then there's another one
called Roderick's

01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:28.490
called Roderick's
 

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:30.370
called Roderick's
this is actually a human isolate that

01:04:30.370 --> 01:04:30.380
this is actually a human isolate that
 

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.130
this is actually a human isolate that
was attenuated by passage and different

01:04:33.130 --> 01:04:33.140
was attenuated by passage and different
 

01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:35.200
was attenuated by passage and different
host and we talk about vaccines we'll

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:35.210
host and we talk about vaccines we'll
 

01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:37.060
host and we talk about vaccines we'll
talk about how that works and there's

01:04:37.060 --> 01:04:37.070
talk about how that works and there's
 

01:04:37.070 --> 01:04:39.550
talk about how that works and there's
just one component in this vaccine so

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:39.560
just one component in this vaccine so
 

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:41.620
just one component in this vaccine so
these are orally administered so I have

01:04:41.620 --> 01:04:41.630
these are orally administered so I have
 

01:04:41.630 --> 01:04:43.630
these are orally administered so I have
the cute little teaspoons here I guess

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:43.640
the cute little teaspoons here I guess
 

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.710
the cute little teaspoons here I guess
you drink it

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:44.720
you drink it
 

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.859
you drink it
multiplies in your intestinal tract and

01:04:46.859 --> 01:04:46.869
multiplies in your intestinal tract and
 

01:04:46.869 --> 01:04:48.880
multiplies in your intestinal tract and
affords protection so these are very

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:48.890
affords protection so these are very
 

01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:51.700
affords protection so these are very
effective about 80% protection against

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:51.710
effective about 80% protection against
 

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.970
effective about 80% protection against
disease now last two years ago when you

01:04:54.970 --> 01:04:54.980
disease now last two years ago when you
 

01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:57.160
disease now last two years ago when you
know last year when this course was

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:57.170
know last year when this course was
 

01:04:57.170 --> 01:05:00.280

going on a paper came out someone had

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:00.290
going on a paper came out someone had
 

01:05:00.290 --> 01:05:03.190
going on a paper came out someone had
taken these two vaccines and they

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:03.200
taken these two vaccines and they
 

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:04.780
taken these two vaccines and they
sequenced it and they found a

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:04.790
sequenced it and they found a
 

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:06.940
sequenced it and they found a
contaminant another virus that wasn't

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:06.950
contaminant another virus that wasn't
 

01:05:06.950 --> 01:05:09.640
contaminant another virus that wasn't
supposed to be there was a porcine surco

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:09.650
supposed to be there was a porcine surco
 

01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:12.240
supposed to be there was a porcine surco
virus so both of these were immediately

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:12.250
virus so both of these were immediately
 

01:05:12.250 --> 01:05:15.010
virus so both of these were immediately
withdrawn from the market for about two

01:05:15.010 --> 01:05:15.020
withdrawn from the market for about two
 

01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.140
withdrawn from the market for about two
months until was decided that this

01:05:17.140 --> 01:05:17.150
months until was decided that this
 

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:21.579
months until was decided that this
circle virus wasn't a problem but the

01:05:21.579 --> 01:05:21.589
circle virus wasn't a problem but the
 

01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:24.400
circle virus wasn't a problem but the
circle virus came from the trypsin that

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:24.410
circle virus came from the trypsin that
 

01:05:24.410 --> 01:05:26.620
circle virus came from the trypsin that
is used to split the cells that are used

01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:26.630
is used to split the cells that are used
 

01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:29.290
is used to split the cells that are used
to grow the virus vaccine so if you've

01:05:29.290 --> 01:05:29.300
to grow the virus vaccine so if you've
 

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.270
to grow the virus vaccine so if you've
ever done cell culture you know you grow

01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280
ever done cell culture you know you grow
 

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.130
ever done cell culture you know you grow
cells and dishes you split them with

01:05:33.130 --> 01:05:33.140
cells and dishes you split them with
 

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.430
cells and dishes you split them with
trypsin the trypsin comes from pig

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440
trypsin the trypsin comes from pig
 

01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:39.280
trypsin the trypsin comes from pig
pancreas and the pigs have circle

01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:39.290
pancreas and the pigs have circle
 

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.650
pancreas and the pigs have circle
viruses so that's where the virus came

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:41.660
viruses so that's where the virus came
 

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.620
viruses so that's where the virus came
from all right the last one we'll talk

it was an outbreak in Queens and it just

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:21.860
it was an outbreak in Queens and it just
 

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:23.800
it was an outbreak in Queens and it just
spread all over the u.s. somehow it got

01:06:23.800 --> 01:06:23.810
spread all over the u.s. somehow it got
 

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:25.390
spread all over the u.s. somehow it got
into the u.s. that summer it may have

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:25.400
into the u.s. that summer it may have
 

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.820

been imported from Israel as one of the
theories because the sequence of this

01:06:29.590 --> 01:06:29.600
theories because the sequence of this
 

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.630
theories because the sequence of this
virus that came to New York is exactly

01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640
virus that came to New York is exactly
 

01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:34.030
virus that came to New York is exactly
the same as an isolate from a goose farm

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:34.040
the same as an isolate from a goose farm
 

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:37.080
the same as an isolate from a goose farm
in Israel so somehow it got over here

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:37.090
in Israel so somehow it got over here
 

01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:41.980
in Israel so somehow it got over here
and it spread all over the US Canada

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:41.990
and it spread all over the US Canada
 

01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:44.650
and it spread all over the US Canada
Mexico this virus is quite has a quite

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:44.660
Mexico this virus is quite has a quite
 

01:06:44.660 --> 01:06:47.650
Mexico this virus is quite has a quite
large host range it infects hundreds of

different birds mosquitoes and 18 other
 

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.960
different birds mosquitoes and 18 other
vertebrates in addition the virus is an

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:52.970
vertebrates in addition the virus is an
 

01:06:52.970 --> 01:06:56.890
vertebrates in addition the virus is an
envelope virus it has a core though that

01:06:56.890 --> 01:06:56.900
envelope virus it has a core though that
 

01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:59.590
envelope virus it has a core though that
has icosahedral symmetry and the

01:06:59.590 --> 01:06:59.600
has icosahedral symmetry and the
 

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.420
has icosahedral symmetry and the
symmetry of the core is passed on to the

01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:01.430
symmetry of the core is passed on to the
 

01:07:01.430 --> 01:07:04.240
symmetry of the core is passed on to the
envelope glycoproteins so if you look at

01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:04.250
envelope glycoproteins so if you look at
 

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:06.430
envelope glycoproteins so if you look at
this envelope virus it structurally has

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440
this envelope virus it structurally has
 

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.410
this envelope virus it structurally has
the glycoproteins have icosahedral

01:07:08.410 --> 01:07:08.420
the glycoproteins have icosahedral
 

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:10.870
the glycoproteins have icosahedral
symmetry because of the underlying core

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880
symmetry because of the underlying core
 

01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:13.690
symmetry because of the underlying core

virus transmission cycle mainly involves

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:17.450
virus transmission cycle mainly involves
 

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:21.160
virus transmission cycle mainly involves
mosquitoes the mosquitoes transmit the

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:21.170
mosquitoes the mosquitoes transmit the
 

01:07:21.170 --> 01:07:23.170
mosquitoes the mosquitoes transmit the
virus back and forth to birds of

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:23.180
virus back and forth to birds of
 

01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:26.020
virus back and forth to birds of
different species so the mosquito bites

01:07:26.020 --> 01:07:26.030
different species so the mosquito bites
 

01:07:26.030 --> 01:07:29.560

bird and so forth there are dead end
 

01:07:31.430 --> 01:07:34.900
bird and so forth there are dead end
hosts such as horses and humans so we

01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:34.910
hosts such as horses and humans so we
 

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:37.120
hosts such as horses and humans so we
get infected by the mosquitoes but we

01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:37.130
get infected by the mosquitoes but we
 

01:07:37.130 --> 01:07:39.370
get infected by the mosquitoes but we
don't transmit it to there's no evidence

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:39.380
don't transmit it to there's no evidence
 

01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:41.560
don't transmit it to there's no evidence
at least that we are transmitting it to

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:41.570
at least that we are transmitting it to
 

01:07:41.570 --> 01:07:43.810
at least that we are transmitting it to
any other host so in nature this exists

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:43.820
any other host so in nature this exists
 

01:07:43.820 --> 01:07:45.520
any other host so in nature this exists
in the transmission cycle between birds

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:45.530
in the transmission cycle between birds
 

01:07:45.530 --> 01:07:49.000
in the transmission cycle between birds
and mosquitoes dead end hosts are horses

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:49.010
and mosquitoes dead end hosts are horses
 

01:07:49.010 --> 01:07:53.500
and mosquitoes dead end hosts are horses
and humans so it's transmitted to us by

01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:53.510
and humans so it's transmitted to us by
 

01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:55.510
and humans so it's transmitted to us by
a mosquito bite the incubation period is

those in fact that have no symptoms at
 

01:08:08.570 --> 01:08:10.570
those in fact that have no symptoms at
all so a lot of people can be infected

01:08:10.570 --> 01:08:10.580
all so a lot of people can be infected

but this is not a consequence for
 

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:14.470
but this is not a consequence for
spreading the virus to others because we

to have virus in your brain if you

01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:50.630
to have virus in your brain if you
 

01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:52.419
to have virus in your brain if you
remember we talked about how the innate

like that yeah so the here's a little

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:16.460
like that yeah so the here's a little

cells go to the lymph node and then the

01:09:44.349 --> 01:09:44.359
cells go to the lymph node and then the
 

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:45.999
cells go to the lymph node and then the
virus gets released and they infect

01:09:45.999 --> 01:09:46.009
virus gets released and they infect
 

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.410
virus gets released and they infect
other cells in the lymph nodes so

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:47.420
other cells in the lymph nodes so
 

01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.089
