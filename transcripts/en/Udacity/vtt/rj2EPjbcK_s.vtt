Now that you've learned about
the importance of APIs,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.900
But before you do that,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.040
let's talk about the art of making good
APIs that your developers will love.

00:00:17.162 --> 00:00:20.990
I want to motivate you to start thinking

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.968
the developers who might be using them.

00:00:22.968 --> 00:00:26.300
I will talk to you about some good
practices when naming your APIs.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.190
As well as some tips from the pros
about supporting your developers

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.840
with proper documentation and
communication streams.
