00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.260
Once we're over about 12 years old,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.900
We're suddenly encouraged to be nice.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.540
We're expected to make efforts in all kinds of areas,

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:14.960
Chiefly around work, but the idea of
expending energy

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.420
thinking about and then practicing the
art of niceness

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.000
sounds bizarre, even eerie.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.840
That's why we've drawn up a checklist

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.910
of 10 virtues that we think matter more
than ever in the modern age.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.280
Resilience.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.200
This is the art of keeping going,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.860
even when things are looking dark;

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.910
of accepting reversals as normal;

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
of refusing to frighten others with one's
own fears;

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.820
and of remembering that human nature

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.129
is, in the end, reassuringly tough.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:45.460
Empathy.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.100
The capacity to connect imaginatively
with the sufferings and unique experiences of

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.660
another person. The courage to become someone else

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.840
and look back at oneself with honesty.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.000
Patience.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.660
We lose our temper because we believe that things should be perfect.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.820
We've grown so good in some areas like putting men on the moon,

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.520
we're ever less able to deal with things that
still insist on going wrong:

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.670
traffic, government, and other people.  We should
grow calmer and more forgiving

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.869
by getting more realistic about how
things actually

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.469
tend to go.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:20.800
Sacrifice.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.760
We're hard-wired to seek our
own advantage,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.800
but also have this miraculous ability, very occasionally,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.800
to forego our own satisfactions in the
name

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.100
of someone or something else. We won't ever
manage to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.350
raise a family love someone else or save
the planet

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460
don't keep up with the art of
sacrifice.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.540
Politeness.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.150
Politeness has a bad name. We often
assume it's about being fake,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.270
which is meant to be bad, as opposed to
really ourselves,

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.000
which is and good. However, given what most of us are really like

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.660
deep down, we should spare others to much exposure to our deeper selves.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.630
We need to learn manners, which aren't evil.
They're the necessary

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.220
internal rules of civilization.
Politeness is very linked to tolerance;

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.490
to a capacity to live alongside people whom one won't necessarily agree with,

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.470
but at the same time, won't be able to
avoid.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.280
Humour.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.440
Seeing the funny sides of
situations and oneself

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.980
doesn't sound very serious, but its
integral to wisdom,

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.360
because it's a sign that one's been able to put a benevolent finger

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.690
on the gap between what we want to
happen and what life

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.250
can actually provide. Like anger, humor springs

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.190
from disappointment, but its
disappointment optimally channeled.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.220
It's one of the best things we can do
with our  sadness

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.540
Self-awareness.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.380
To know oneself is to try not to blame others for one's troubles and moods.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.709
To have a sense of what's going on inside oneself and what actually belongs to the

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:53.900
world.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.300
Forgiveness. Forgiveness means a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.610
long memory all the times when we wouldn't have got through life

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.150
without someone cutting us some slack. It's recognizing that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.560
living with others is impossible without excusing errors.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.740
Hope.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.050
The way the world is now is only a pale
shadow of what it could one day be.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.590
We're still only at the beginning of history.
As you get older,

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.980
despair becomes far easier, almost reflex,

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.040
whereas in adolescence it was still cool and adventurous. Pessimism

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.240
isn't necessarily deep; nor optimism shallow.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.560
Confidence.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.540
The greatest projects and
schemes die

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.010
for new grander reason than that we don't dare. Confidence isn't arrogance,

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.330
it's based on constant awareness of how short life is,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.660
and how little we ultimately lose from
risking everything.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.060
Let's try to keep these in mind and
practice them a little every day.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.800
Resilience

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:54.560
Empathy

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.280
Patience

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.920
Sacrifice

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.560
Politeness

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.200
Humor

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:57.840
Self-Awareness

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:58.400
Forgiveness

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.080
Hope

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.320
Confidence
