00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.660
We're on problem 132.

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.650
If the integer n is greater
than 1, is n equal to 2?

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.490
So they tell us that the integer
n is greater than 1,

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.350
and they ask us, is
n equal to 2?

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.925
Statement 1, n has exactly
two positive factors.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.620
Well that's certainly true
of the number 2.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.220
But it's also true of
any prime number.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.770
I mean n could be 7.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.210
7 only has two positive
factors, 1 and 7.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.970
So it's true of any
prime number.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.885
So this, by itself, isn't enough
information to say that

00:00:45.885 --> 00:00:47.550
it's definitely 2.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.300
Statement 2 tells us the
difference of any two distinct

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.180
positive factors of n is odd.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.430
This is interesting.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.355
We're just dealing in kind
of the positive world.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.030
So let's think about it.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.360
Just thinking about statement
1, we said, OK, what numbers

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.120
have only two factors?

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.860
Well prime numbers only
have two factors.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.890
This only tells us
that n is prime.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
2 is a prime number, but it's
not the only prime number.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.310
But for most other prime
numbers, what do

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.360
we know about them?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.950
Well they're odd, right?

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.670
Most prime numbers are odd.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.240
Other than 2, what are the
other prime numbers?

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.480
You go to 3, you go to
7, you go to 11, 5.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.000
Let me ask you, why
are they odd?

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.200
Because if they were even, they
would be divisible by 2

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.580
and they wouldn't be prime.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.080
So by definition really, every
prime number that's not 2 is

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.480
not divisible by 2 because
it's prime.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.220
So they have to be
odd numbers.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.020
So for any other prime number,
the number is going to be 1

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.880
and itself.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.940
So let's call that p.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.060
So the difference between the
two numbers, and p is going to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.160
be an odd number.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.280
Every other prime number
other than 2 is odd.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.840
So the difference between
the two, p minus 1.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.910
If I take an odd number and I
subtract one from it, I get an

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.750
even number.

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.960
That's true for any
odd number.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.650
So every other prime
number is odd.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:31.830
And this happens.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.555
But they're saying that when I
subtract the difference I get

00:02:33.555 --> 00:02:34.960
an odd, I get an odd number.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.720
Well the only number that's
true for is 2.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.170
Because factors of
2 are 1 and 2.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.600
If I subtract 1 from 2, 2
minus 1 is equal to 1.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.070
That's because 2 is the only
even prime number.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.810
So this first statement says we
have to be dealing with a

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:52.840
prime number.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.940
The second statement says, well,
the number really has to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.780
be an even number if it's
going to be prime.

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.430
Let me think about the
other two-- if

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.200
statement 2 alone is enough.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.790
The difference of any two
positive factors of n is odd,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.860
any two positive factors of n.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.690
Now this alone doesn't help us
because n could be-- I don't

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.440
know-- it could be 1 and 6.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.260
The difference between
1 and 6 is 5, so it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.720
would satisfy this.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.880
So n could be 6 if we just
took statement 2.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.890
So we really need both.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.540
Statement 1 tells us
that n is prime.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.340
Statement 2 tells us that n has
to be even, that it has to

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.420
be an even number.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.060
So frankly, there's only
one prime even

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.310
number, and that's 2.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.740
So both statements together
are necessary

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.260
to answer this question.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:55.490
133, every member of a certain
club volunteers to contribute

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.600
equally to the purchase price
of a $60 gift certificate.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.350
How many members of
does a club have?

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.750
So we want to know-- let's call
m for members-- how many

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.530
members does a club have?

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.900
Question 1, each member's
contribution is to be $4.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.060
Let's see, it says they
contribute equally to a

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.170
purchase price.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.480
OK, so the number of members
times-- and they say every

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.440
member of a certain club.

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.150
So now they don't say
some members.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.660
So m is the number of
members, and they

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.510
contribute equally $4.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.580
That's going to be
equal to $60.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.450
So then you immediately know
that you can solve for the

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:34.080
number of members.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.780
There are 15 members
of this club.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:37.570
Maybe I'm missing something.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.200
Statement 2, if 5 club members
fail to contribute, the share

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.185
of each contributing member
will increase by $2.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.090
So that means that if I were
to take the amount that 5

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.710
members were to contribute--
so let's say that the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.610
contribution amount is c.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:09.630
So if we take the amount that 5
members would contribute, so

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:17.240
5 times c, and divide it by
the remaining members, so

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.570
divide by m minus 5, that
would be that each

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:27.730
contributing member will
increase by $2.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.190
So this is the amount that would
have been contributed by

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.640
those 5 people.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:34.215
Let me make sure that I'm
not missing anything.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.080
That is going to
be equal to $2.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.500
So this is the amount that those
5 members would have

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.510
contributed.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.580
If they don't contribute it,
it's going to have to be

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.180
divided by the other members.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.490
So however many members
there are minus 5.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.570
That is going to be-- when you
divide the amount divided by

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.320
who has to pay for it-- is
$2 per leftover member.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:04.660
We also know that the members
times the contribution for

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.180
member if everyone pays, is
going to be equal to $60.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.180
That they give us in the problem
statement, that m

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.610
members are going to contribute
equally, and

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.170
they're going to end
up with $60.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:17.450
So actually, we have two linear

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.710
equations and two unknowns.

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.510
So statement 2 alone is actually
sufficient to solve

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.330
this problem.

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.120
If this doesn't look like a
linear question, you can just

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.320
multiply both sides by m minus
5 and you get 5c is equal to

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.630
2m minus 10.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.150
Now this looks a lot more
like a linear equation.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.410
Well, actually, this isn't a
complete linear equation.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:42.720
But let me solve it just to make
the point clear for you.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.525
So if I were to say that c--
this isn't a linear equation,

00:06:47.525 --> 00:06:52.400
so I shouldn't have said that--
c is equal to 60/m.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.930
If c is equal to 60/m, so then
this turns to 5 times 60.

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:06.830
So 300/m is equal
to 2m minus 10.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.170
Then you are left with what?

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.610
Multiply both sides by m, you
get 300 is equal to 2m

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.180
squared minus 10m.

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:18.500
Divide both sides by 2, you
get 150 is equal to m

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.530
squared minus 10m.

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:22.860
Then subtract 150
from both sides.

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:33.170
You get m squared minus 10m
minus 150 is equal to 0.

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:38.360
Then let me see if I can just do
this just by factoring it.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:48.700
Minus 150, 30 times 5,
no, that's not good.

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.510
15 times 10.

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:57.850
So if I do m minus 15 times--
no, that doesn't work.

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:00.910
15, 25, and 6.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.550
I know one of the
answers already.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.050
I know it's 15.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:09.550
m minus 15 times m plus 10.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.630
Oh, actually, I just realized
what my mistake was.

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.140
I went from this step
to this step.

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.120
So I divided both sides by 2.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.290
So 300 went into 150.

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.130
2m squared-- this
had to be 5m.

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:22.730
That's my mistake.

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:23.030
5m.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.920
M squared minus 5m minus 150.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:28.780
So that's m minus 15 times
m plus 10 is equal to 0.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:34.120
So that tells us that m is
equal to 15 or minus 10.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.780
This is actually a quadratic
equation.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:39.289
We know that the members
can't be negative.

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:41.630
There's a positive number
of members.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.830
So statement 2 alone is enough
information to know that there

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.900
are exactly 15 members
in this club.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:48.650
Next problem.

00:08:48.650 --> 00:08:51.270
It had me stumped there because
of my careless mistake

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:52.910
there for a second.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.160
Next problem.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.570
OK, problem 134.

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:05.230
So that last one, I don't
know if I just said it.

00:09:05.230 --> 00:09:07.570
Each statement alone
is sufficient.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:08.540
So problem 134.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:14.700
If m and n are positive
integers, is the square root

00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:20.910
of n minus m an integer?

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:22.730
So m and n are positive
integers.

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.840
OK, so they tell us.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:34.920
Statement 1, they say n is
greater than m plus 15.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.190
Well you know, n is greater
than m plus 15.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:45.480
So if n is exactly 16 greater
than m, this is another way of

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.270
saying that n minus m
is greater than 15.

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:50.420
That tells that what's under
the denominator is

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:51.470
greater than 15.

00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:54.510
Well, if what's under the
denominator is 16, then it is

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:54.750
an integer.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:57.890
But if it's 17, which also meets
this requirement, it's

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:58.580
not an integer.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:01.800
So this isn't enough information
by itself.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:10.730
Statement 2 says n is equal to m
times m plus 1, which is the

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:14.830
same thing as m squared
plus m.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.420
So if we substitute that into
this equation, we get the

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:29.200
square root of m squared
plus m minus m.

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.410
That's m times m plus 1.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:34.820
It's m squared plus m.

00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.810
This minus m is right there.

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.680
So that cancels out and we're
just left with square root of

00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:40.580
m squared, which is going
to be equal to

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:42.400
m, which is an integer.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.780
So statement 2 alone is
sufficient to say that this

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:49.500
would be an integer as long
as n is equal to m

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:51.680
times m plus 1.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.410
I've run out of time.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:54.140
See you in the next video.
