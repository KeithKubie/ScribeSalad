00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.599
Guess what?

00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:05.799
China has announced plans to launch an “artificial
moon” into our skies by 2020.

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.130
And, as crazy as that sounds, it’s not actually
the first time something like this has been

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:11.130
attempted.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.130
But first.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.130
China’s new plan.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.231
As reported in China Daily, China plans to
launch an “illumination satellite” into

00:00:17.231 --> 00:00:19.249
orbit above the city of Chengdu.

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:22.390
Well actually, four illumination satellites.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.210
The first as a proof of concept in 2020 and
the next three as the real deal in 2022.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
There aren’t a ton of details about the
satellites themselves yet, like how big they

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.980
are or what they will be made of, but we DO
know they’ll be covered with a “reflective

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.390
coating similar to the moon’s”?

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.899
Whatever that’s supposed to mean.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.260
At the proposed distance of 500km, a single
satellite is expected to illuminate an area

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.610
between 10 and 80 km, with light around “8
times brighter” than the moon’s.

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.590
If all goes to plan, the scientists hope the
moons will replace street lights in urban

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.700
areas and save the city millions in electricity
costs annually.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.630
They could also help light up streets during
natural disasters and blackouts.

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.109
Those same benefits are what prompted Russia
to try something similar 20 years ago, in

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:08.109
what was called Project Znamya.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.470
In 1993, Russia successfully deployed their
own prototype of an illumination satellite,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.240
about a 20 meter reflective film that unfolded
in space.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.600
For a few hours, it orbited a couple hundred
meters above earth, beaming a 5km wide spotlight

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
over Europe.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.329
But, that light only moved at about 8 km/hour,
meaning most people just saw a flash in the

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.780
sky as it passed.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.159
Eventually, it fell out of orbit and burned
up on reentry.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.820
The Russians tried this again a few years
later, this time with a 25 meter mirror.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.929
However, the satellite failed to deploy, and
it quickly fell out of orbit.

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:45.400
There were plans to launch a third, even bigger
mirror, but the project faced serious budgeting

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.579
issues and was later abandoned.

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.700
So China’s plan is essentially picking up
where Russia left off, taking note of their

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
mistakes and making something that will actually
work, right?

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.840
Well, as critics have been quick to point
out, that doesn’t appear to be the case.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.240
The first, and probably biggest, issue with
China’s proposed scheme concerns the height

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.260
of orbit.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.229
In order for a satellite to track a single
city on earth, it would need to be in a geostationary

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.209
orbit, about 36,000 km above earth.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.189
At the proposed 500 km, China’s satellites
would face the same problem that Russia’s

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.209
did, whipping around earth, quickly lighting
up random places for a fraction of a second

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.430
as they go- which isn’t exactly the goal.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.670
And even if 500km was a typo, and they meant
to say 36 thousand, a satellite at that height

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.909
would need to be extraordinarily large - hundreds
of meters across- to reflect much back to

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:37.909
earth.

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:41.460
And while the article doesn’t specify how
big China’s sats will be, launching something

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.329
big enough could be prohibitively difficult.

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:49.799
Critics also pointed out the plan has no mention
of any sort of thrusters or fuel onboard these

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:50.799
satellites.

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.370
And that would probably be a necessity since
out in space, the satellites-- like the Russian

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.250
mirrors-- will experience drag and solar radiation
that will eventually push them out of orbit.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.900
The cost of the initial fuel and subsequent
refueling missions could outweigh any savings

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.829
in electricity costs on Earth.

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.079
Reportedly, researchers at several universities
and institutes have looked over the plan and

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.950
have given it the okay for trial, so maybe
we just don’t have all the details.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.209
If that’s the case, and the plan does work,
should we be worried?

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.150
Many scientists have expressed concerns that
these satellites will amplify the light pollution

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.099
problems we already have.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:31.500
Excess light from cities today alters night
cycles of animals, the sleep cycles of humans,

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.970
and disrupts astronomers’ view of space.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.840
And a project of this scale will likely make
those problems worse.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.810
It’s not clear in the reports whether the
Chinese government has given these plans any

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.340
sort of official backing, So, I suppose for
now, we’ll just have to wait and see if

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.620
any new moons light up the sky.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.959
You may not be able to launch your own illumination
satellite, but you CAN launch your very own

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.959
website with Domain.com.

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.890

and has all the tools you need to build a

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:59.890
new website.

One last thing, the engineer who started the
Russian satellite project actually wanted

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:30.069
to test solar sail technology, but he found
the prospect of daylight-extension was much

00:04:30.069 --> 00:04:31.480
easier to get funding for.
