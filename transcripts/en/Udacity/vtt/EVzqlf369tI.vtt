By unstructured we mean data arrives in lots of different formats.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.100
For example, a bank might have list of your credit card

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.530
and account transactions. They may also have scans of checks, records

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.050
with customer service interactions. Maybe even recordings of those phone calls.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.550
All that data in a variety of different formats can be

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.160
hard to store and reconcile in a traditional system. And this

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.660
brings us back to volume. You want to store that data

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.830
in its original format so you're not throwing any information away.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.770
That way you can then process the data later in

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.800
different ways. For instance, if we transcribe a call center

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.690
conversation into text we have what people said to customer

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.130
service representatives. But if we had the actual recording as well

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.710
then later we might develop software which can interpret the

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.980
tone of voice the customer uses. And that might lead to

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.790
a very different interpretation of the data. And the nice

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.860
things about Hadoop is that it doesn't care what format your

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.010
data comes in. Unlike a traditional database, you can store the

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.120
data in its raw format and manipulate it and reformat it later.
