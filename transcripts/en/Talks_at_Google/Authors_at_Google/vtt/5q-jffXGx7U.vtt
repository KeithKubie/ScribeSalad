00:00:02.321 --> 00:00:02.820
EMMA: OK.

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.690
Welcome, everyone, to this
G [? Pause ?] author's talk.

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.840
And I'm delighted
to be welcoming

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.660
Shauna Shapiro to talk to
us here at Google today

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.170
about mindful parenting.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.020
And I was thinking, who better
to talk to us about mindful

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.020
parenting than
Shauna, as she has

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.230
20 years' experience as
a mindfulness meditation

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.020
practitioner, having studied
both in Thailand, and Nepal,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.780
and here in the West?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.570
And she also has a scientific
academic background,

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.050
with a PhD.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.560
She's a clinical
psychologist and also

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.620
professor at Santa
Clara University.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.640
And, maybe most
importantly, she's

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.480
a parent to her
nine-year-old son Jackson.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.190
I met Shauna first
here at Google

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.640
when she attended one of our
Search Inside Yourself classes.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.820
And the students
reported how much value

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.080
she added to the class,
just from her own experience

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.550
and from her research.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.769
So I'm just delighted that she's
able to spend a bit more time

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.980
with us talking through
some of her insights.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.647
Please join me in
welcoming Shauna Shapiro.

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:12.730
SHAUNA SHAPIRO: Thank you.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.330
Thank you, Emma.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.830
Yeah.

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.270
Well, I'm delighted to be here.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.310
Every time I come to Google I
feel really inspired by what's

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.790
happening here, and just kind
of the vision and the integrity

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.600
with which people are
attempting to live these values.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.230
I don't think any of us
are doing it perfectly yet.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.150
And I'm sure there's a
lot that's difficult.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.630
But really, I feel
the commitment here,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.860
and it inspires me.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.990
So, welcome.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.420
And I'm curious-- is everyone
in the room a parent?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.040
Is anyone not a parent?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.260
And you're just here to
learn about mindfulness?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.529
AUDIENCE: I will be.

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:57.320
SHAUNA SHAPIRO: OK.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.832
You will be.

00:01:57.832 --> 00:01:59.790
Well, that means you
already are at some point.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.690
Yeah, somewhere in
the consciousness.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.360
So I'm really excited to
share some of this with you.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.030
What I was reflecting
on-- because there's

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.770
so much that I
would like to cover,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.390
and we have just
an hour together.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.760
For me, what's most important
is for you understand

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.600
what mindfulness is
and to really give you

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.340
an experience of it, so
that it can help nourish you

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.620
as a human being
and as a parent.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.930
And so towards the end,
we'll get in specifically

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.980
to mindful parenting,
but my intention

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.670
is really to help anchor us in
what mindfulness actually is.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.910
And I want to take just
a moment to acknowledge

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.520
some of my teachers, first
of all, my co-author,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:43.510
Dr. Christopher White.

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.130
He's a pediatrician.

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:48.650
Jack Kornfield, Roger
Walsh, Shinzen Young.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.690
And then this is a photo
of my grandparents.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.020
This is Ben and Nancy Friedman.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.930
And welcome.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.234
I like to really
acknowledge them,

00:02:58.234 --> 00:02:59.900
because even though
a lot of my training

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.200
was in Thailand and Nepal
in Buddhist monasteries,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.920
and my understanding
of mindfulness

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:11.360
does stem from that tradition,
my Protestant grandparents

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.140
taught me as much
about mindfulness

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.030
than any of my experiences.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.200
And they didn't meditate.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.610
Their passion, their
presence, their curiosity,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.370
their kindness,
their aliveness--

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.590
that's the essence
of mindfulness.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.700
This is a universal practice.

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.910
It's a universal way of being.

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.520
And it transcends
religion and culture.

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.080
So, again, my
intention is really

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.820
just for us to understand
mindfulness first and foremost.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.060
Second, I want to briefly
review the research

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.170
and talk a bit about
is mindfulness helpful?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:49.660
I think that helps
motivate people,

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.310
when they know the
science behind it.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.810
And then talk a
little bit about how

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.470
do we integrate
it into parenting?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.790
And ending with what I
think is most important,

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.330
which is self-compassion.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.630
I think if you learn
nothing else today except

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.660
to be a little bit gentler
and a little kinder

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.774
to yourself as a
parent-- in fact,

00:04:06.774 --> 00:04:08.940
how many people feel like
they're not quite doing it

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.350
right as a parent?

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.141
Haven't quite figured it out?

00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:13.640
OK.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.260
I'm right there with you.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.746
It's actually this pervasive
sense of I'm a terrible parent.

00:04:19.746 --> 00:04:21.579
Like, everyone else
kind of has it together.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.370
They're getting it.

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:23.530
But I can't do it.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.540
And yet everyone feels that way.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.340
So I think this piece
of self-compassion

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.600
is really important.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.420
All right.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.196
So this is our book.

00:04:32.196 --> 00:04:34.070
This wonderful quote we
have, by Andrew Weil.

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.675
He says, "One of the
most exceptional road

00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:37.925
maps on how to raise happy,
resilient, and emotionally

00:04:37.925 --> 00:04:39.120
healthy children."

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.190
And that's really
the intention, is

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.131
how do we raise children
that are happy and healthy?

00:04:44.131 --> 00:04:45.880
That's what we most
want for our children.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.140
Not that they're rich and
successful and famous,

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.890
but happy, healthy, resilient.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.240
And then emotionally
intelligent.

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.255
Really not just using
their intellect,

00:04:55.255 --> 00:04:57.380
but using their heart,
their body, their sensation,

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.130
their emotions, for how
to navigate life and live

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.980
in the most beautiful way.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.810
So the foundation
of mindful parenting

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:11.540
is awareness and compassion
of ourselves and others.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.330
Your own awareness, your own
compassion, your own presence,

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.844
is essential.

00:05:17.844 --> 00:05:19.260
This is from Gordon
Neufeld, who's

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.750
been really influential in my
understanding of parenting.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.890
He says, "Parenthood is above
all a relationship, not a skill

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.240
to be acquired.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.610
Attachment is not a behavior
to be learned, but a connection

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.460
to be sought."

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.070
OK?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.445
So we want someone to come in
and say, well just do A, B,

00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:38.370
and C, and it's all
going to be good.

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.360
Right?

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.270
But actually, parenting requires
connection and relationship.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.750
And this requires presence.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.170
Thich Nhat Hanh says,
"The most precious gift

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.900
we can offer others
is our presence.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.960
When mindfulness
embraces those we love,

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.480
they bloom like flowers."

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.580
OK?

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:59.660
So mindfulness is presence.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:00.980
That's what it is.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:05.790
Mindfulness is about being
fully here, fully present.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.270
And what that requires is that
we begin to see things clearly.

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.900
So the word "mindfulness"
actually means to see clearly.

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.430
To see clearly what's
happening in this moment.

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.180
To see clearly what your child
is needing in a given moment.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.731
To see clearly, we
need to do something.

00:06:24.731 --> 00:06:26.730
What do we need to do to
be able to see clearly?

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.390
We have to be able
to pay attention.

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.940
So I've been talking now
for maybe four minutes.

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:36.490
I'm curious-- how many people
have noticed that your mind has

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:39.350
wandered off in these
last four minutes?

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.270
Come on.

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.860
Everyone.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.920
In fact, don't even
raise your hand.

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.550
I know.

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:44.508
I'll bring you into my
laboratory and I'll look

00:06:44.508 --> 00:06:46.270
at your brain if you
tell me you didn't.

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:47.895
Your mind has wandered
in the last four

00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:50.460
minutes many, many times.

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.780
What we've found is that the
mind wanders approximately 50%

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.110
of the time.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.130
That's a lot.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:57.650
So let's say you live to be 100.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.560
That's 50 years of your
life that are spaced out.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.530
That's not even
counting sleeping time.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.300
Right?

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.600
So part of mindfulness, part
of the way that we learn

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.770
how to see things clearly, is
by gathering our attention here

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.900
in the present moment.

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.420
So just try it with me for,
like, the next two minutes.

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.180
See if you can actually be here.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.720
Because all of your bodies
are here right now, right?

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.870
No one's left.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.076
Thank you.

00:07:21.076 --> 00:07:23.782
See if you can have your
mind be where your body is,

00:07:23.782 --> 00:07:25.740
instead of just leaving
this empty shell that's

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:28.530
kind of like spaced out and
glazed over for me to look at.

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.030
Right?

00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:29.630
So good.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:30.180
You're doing great.

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.080
A minute and a half left.

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:32.381
You're all right here with me.

00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:32.880
I feel it.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.046
And you are definitely here.

00:07:34.046 --> 00:07:35.090
Welcome.

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:35.780
OK.

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:38.682
But mindfulness is not
just about attention.

00:07:38.682 --> 00:07:41.140
Because otherwise a sniper
could be the most mindful person

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:41.681
in the world.

00:07:41.681 --> 00:07:43.700
They have amazing
attentional skills.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.710
So mindfulness is also about
why we're paying attention.

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.567
What is my intention?

00:07:48.567 --> 00:07:49.760
Right?

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.640
What is my vision?

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.650
What is my goal?

00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:53.920
What is the kind of motivation?

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.080
So why are you paying attention?

00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.570
And then how you pay attention.

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.470
So how is your attitude?

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.870
This is the quality
of your attention.

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:03.930
You have 30 seconds left.

00:08:03.930 --> 00:08:05.780
Are you still here with me?

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.170
It's kind of hard,
huh, to pay attention?

00:08:08.170 --> 00:08:09.000
OK?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.190
So also looking at how
am I paying attention?

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:14.450
Am I judging myself because
I just wandered off again?

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:17.217
Or am I being curious and
kind, and saying, oh, whoops!

00:08:17.217 --> 00:08:17.800
There it goes.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.008
She said my mind was going
to wander 50% of the time.

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:20.970
It is.

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:21.760
Wow.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.150
Interesting.

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:25.090
So that's our attitude.

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:28.530
And, actually, mindfulness
is about all three

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:33.655
of these elements-- intention,
attention, and attitude.

00:08:33.655 --> 00:08:34.155
OK?

00:08:34.155 --> 00:08:35.880
Does that make sense?

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.850
So I want to talk
about each of these.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:41.919
As I said, intention
is really knowing

00:08:41.919 --> 00:08:43.669
why we're doing
what we're doing.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.160
Why am I paying attention?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.420
What is my vision?

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:48.760
What is my goal?

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.330
Intention sets the
compass of your heart.

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:55.420
It says, I want to
go in this direction.

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.264
It's not a destination.

00:08:57.264 --> 00:08:58.680
You're not trying
to get anywhere.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.580
You're just kind of
guiding yourself.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:03.130
This is the general
direction I want to head.

00:09:03.130 --> 00:09:04.910
So you don't end up
striving, and getting

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:06.810
really goal-orientated
and really fixated

00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:07.860
on where you're going.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.780
You're actually present
for the process.

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.180
And you're aligning yourself
with what's most important.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.330
Jon Kabat-Zinn, who's
one of my main teachers,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:20.260
he says, "Your intentions set
the stage for what is possible.

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:23.760
They remind you moment to moment
of why you're practicing."

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.320
He said, "I used
to think meditation

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:27.760
was so powerful that as
long as you did it at all,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:29.470
you'd see growth and change.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.050
But time has taught me some
kind of personal vision

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.550
is necessary."

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.220
I love that.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.460
First of all, he's so humble.

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.570
He says, oh, I used to think
you could just sit people down,

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.653
have them meditate, and
everything would work out.

00:09:39.653 --> 00:09:42.270
But now I realize,
some kind of intention.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.390
So when I work with my patients,
we always begin with intention.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:47.950
Why are you here?

00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:50.820
My favorite quote, by
Suzuki Roshi, he says,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.630
"The most important
thing is to remember

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.120
the most important thing."

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.320
That's it.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:59.770
You just have to remember
what is most important to you.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.880
And it's not so easy.

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:03.540
We forget.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:05.020
This is a picture of my son.

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.662
This is Jackson.

00:10:06.662 --> 00:10:08.370
He's nine years old,
so he doesn't really

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:09.760
look like that anymore.

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.560
But I love this photo.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:17.070
And recently, I had this
experience where he really

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:21.160
reminded me of how easy it
is to forget our intention.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.370
How easy it is to forget
what's most important.

00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:26.040
So I was teaching
in Europe, and I'd

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:28.920
been gone for two weeks, which
was the longest I've ever

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.750
been apart from him.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.732
And as I was flying home, I was
just kind of filled with guilt.

00:10:33.732 --> 00:10:35.815
And, like, how's it going
to be when we reconnect?

00:10:35.815 --> 00:10:38.010
And have I ruined
our attachment bond?

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.430
And what kind of mother am I?

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.513
And then I realized that
guilt wasn't really going

00:10:42.513 --> 00:10:43.940
to help me reconnect with him.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:45.940
And so I set an intention.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.020
When I get home, the first
day, all I'm going to do

00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:50.100
is be with Jackson.

00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:51.500
I'm not going to check my email.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.999
I'm not going to
go through my mail.

00:10:52.999 --> 00:10:54.202
I just want to be with him.

00:10:54.202 --> 00:10:54.785
So I got home.

00:10:54.785 --> 00:10:56.490
It was a beautiful day in Marin.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.700
And I decided we'd
go to the beach.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.826
So I'm packing up picnic
and making it all perfect,

00:11:00.826 --> 00:11:02.491
because I'm going to
be the perfect mom,

00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:04.370
and show him how
much I love him.

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.290
And I get all his
stuff together.

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.380
And I'm like, OK, Jackson.

00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.890
You want to go to the beach?

00:11:08.890 --> 00:11:10.460
And he was like, nah.

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:11.797
I don't really want to go.

00:11:11.797 --> 00:11:12.630
I was like, come on.

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:13.560
It's going to be so fun.

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:13.706
It's sunny.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:14.872
I have everything packed up.

00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:15.580
Let's go.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:16.340
He was like, OK.

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:18.510
And he kind of like is
shuffling out the door.

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:21.180
And I'm 10 feet ahead of
him, like already at the car,

00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.900
ready to have the
best day ever so he

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:24.830
knows how much I love him.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.730
And I get to the
car, and I look back.

00:11:26.730 --> 00:11:29.620
And he's sitting on the
ground on our front porch.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.190
And I'm like, Jackson.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.000
And I feel a little
bit of impatience.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.280
And that kind of familiar
contraction in my body.

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.520
And, luckily, I'd been
teaching mindfulness every day

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.320
for the past two weeks,
so I had some awareness.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:47.670
And there was a moment where--
it was this choice point.

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.490
And I could see it.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:50.794
I could get impatient
and say, hurry up.

00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:51.710
Let's go to the beach.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.860
This is our plan.

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.720
And then I remembered
my intention.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.620
Right?

00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.280
What was the most
important thing?

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:00.530
I just wanted him to know I
was home, and he was safe,

00:12:00.530 --> 00:12:01.900
and I love him.

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.080
And so I walked over to him.

00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:04.990
And I sat down.

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:06.970
He was actually
looking at these ants

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:09.850
on the ground, which
were kind of interesting.

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.130
And I sat down next to him.

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:12.540
And we're sitting there.

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:16.440
And all of a sudden he leaned
his little body into mine.

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.520
And I could just feel his
shoulder and his weight resting

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:23.030
in to me, and the
sun on our backs.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:26.730
That was the most
important thing, right?

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:28.450
And yet we forget.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.350
We forget in an instant.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:34.070
And so mindfulness is about
remembering our intention.

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:35.500
What is most important?

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:36.000
OK?

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.295
So that's the first element.

00:12:37.295 --> 00:12:37.795
Intention.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.520
So I'd like you to just let
your eyes close for a moment,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.407
and see if you can feel
into why you're here.

00:12:49.407 --> 00:12:50.323
What's your intention?

00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:54.990
And don't really think about it.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.870
See if you can actually
feel in your body.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.585
Like maybe feel the
love for your child.

00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:06.810
This feeling into what is
most important for you.

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.050
And then you can
let your eyes open.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.370
And see if you can keep
that alive in your body

00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:20.640
as we continue.

00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:21.680
OK.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:24.250
The second element of
mindfulness, as I mentioned,

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:26.140
is attention.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.440
This is simply paying attention
in the present moment.

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:33.260
And as you've noticed, it's
kind of challenging, right?

00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.740
So there's a picture
of this adorable monkey

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:40.220
up here, because our mind has
been compared to a monkey mind.

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.840
That our mind
swings from thought

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.610
to thought like a monkey
swings from limb to limb.

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:45.390
Watch.

00:13:45.390 --> 00:13:47.390
Watch your mind.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:49.015
Tell me if this isn't true.

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.680
Can you imagine if I put a
big loudspeaker hooked up

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:55.990
to your brain, and I could hear
all your thoughts right now?

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.880
Can you imagine that?

00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.230
Our thoughts are--
you're not in charge.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.770
You would not be thinking
those thoughts right now.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:05.010
That's not where you would
want your attention to be.

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:05.760
Right?

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.700
Anne Lamott says, she goes,
"The mind has no shame."

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.560
The mind has no shame.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.690
"It's like walking in a
dangerous neighborhood.

00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:14.336
You don't want to
go there alone."

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:15.710
You don't want to
go there alone.

00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:18.390
The mind is just going
wherever it wants to go.

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.390
And so part of this
practice is learning

00:14:21.390 --> 00:14:24.650
how to train the mind
in the present moment.

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:27.650
How to gather your
attention back.

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:30.000
And we do this in a
very gentle, kind way.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.610
So it's almost as if the
mind is like a puppy dog.

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:34.660
And it wanders off.

00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:35.810
And you're like, stay.

00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:36.680
Come back.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.030
It wanders off again.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:40.360
You say, come back.

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.540
We have between 12,000
and 50,000 thoughts

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:45.420
every single day.

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.210
95% are the same.

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.209
Think about that.

00:14:50.209 --> 00:14:51.500
Actually, don't think about it.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.453
Just experience that.

00:14:53.453 --> 00:14:54.300
Right?

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.550
So part of this
practice is learning

00:14:56.550 --> 00:14:59.140
how to work with all these
distracting thoughts,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.560
and bring our attention
back right here.

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.270
And not get so lost
in the thoughts.

00:15:04.270 --> 00:15:06.020
Emo Phillips, who is
a wonderful comedian,

00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.210
he says, "I used to
think the brain was

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:10.630
the most wonderful
organ in my body.

00:15:10.630 --> 00:15:13.450
And then I realized who
was telling me this."

00:15:13.450 --> 00:15:14.910
Right?

00:15:14.910 --> 00:15:16.410
So don't believe your thoughts.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:20.810
They're not necessarily
real or true.

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:22.420
So what we do with
mindfulness is

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:25.620
we begin to train and
stabilize our attention

00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.369
in the present moment, so
that we can see clearly.

00:15:30.369 --> 00:15:32.410
Remember, that's what the
word mindfulness means.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:34.310
We want to be able
to see clearly

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:38.020
what's true so that we
can respond skillfully.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:40.640
And that's really
the art of parenting,

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.420
is responding skillfully.

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.110
There's no way that
I can tell you,

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.404
well, just do this
when this happens.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:48.570
Because we don't really
know what's going to happen.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.194
It's different.

00:15:49.194 --> 00:15:50.940
It's complex in every moment.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:56.220
And so the key to this is really
being so present and so alive

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.280
that you can see
clearly what's needed

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:02.126
and meet it in any given moment.

00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:03.980
Does that make sense?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.440
OK.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.560
The third element
of mindfulness--

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.520
this is the last
one-- is our attitude.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:14.800
This is how we're
paying attention.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:19.260
When I first was learning about
meditation, I went to Thailand.

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.290
I was 19 years old.

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:22.750
I didn't really know
anything about meditation.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.980
And I met this beautiful monk.

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:29.420
And he didn't speak any English,
and I didn't speak any Thai.

00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.920
But he kind of motioned
for me to pay attention

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:35.200
to my breath going in
and out of my nose.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.855
So I sat down at this monastery
for a two-week silent retreat,

00:16:39.855 --> 00:16:41.230
where you meditate
from like four

00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:43.390
the morning until 9:00 at night.

00:16:43.390 --> 00:16:45.150
And I paid attention
to my breath

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:47.400
going in and out of my nose.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.470
So what I noticed, just like
you guys have been noticing,

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.990
is that my mind wandered.

00:16:52.990 --> 00:16:54.510
So I'd feel, like, one breath.

00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:55.500
Maybe two breaths.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.970
Maybe even three
breaths in a row.

00:16:56.970 --> 00:16:58.860
And then my mind
would wander off.

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:00.410
And so what did I do?

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.550
Brought it back.

00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:02.440
Right?

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:04.924
And I brought it back
again and again and again.

00:17:04.924 --> 00:17:06.549
And I started trying
harder and harder.

00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:07.819
Like why can't I do this?

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:09.400
What's wrong with me?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.869
Has anyone tried
to meditate before?

00:17:11.869 --> 00:17:12.369
Right?

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.994
Anyone feel like they
just can't do it?

00:17:13.994 --> 00:17:15.791
Like meditation's not for you?

00:17:15.791 --> 00:17:17.540
That's how everyone
feels when they start.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.800
OK?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.730
And that's how I felt.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:22.229
I was like, who do I think I
am that I could be a meditator?

00:17:22.229 --> 00:17:23.710
And I think I'm a
spiritual person.

00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:25.130
What am I doing here?

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:26.650
Why am I at this
horrible monastery?

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:29.980
It's like 120 degrees and
there's mosquitoes everywhere.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.530
Became really frustrated,
really judgmental.

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:34.160
And by the third
day of sitting there

00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.784
in silence trying
to watch my breath,

00:17:35.784 --> 00:17:38.450
not only was I judging myself, I
was judging everyone around me.

00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.780
Why are all these
monks sitting here?

00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:40.220
What are they doing?

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.090
They're just wasting their time.

00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.690
They're sitting here.

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:42.523
What are they doing?

00:17:42.523 --> 00:17:43.160
There's--

00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:47.830
And finally a monk flew in
from London who spoke English.

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:49.230
And I had an interview with him.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.930
And I told them
what was happening.

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:53.940
And he looked at me with
a lot of compassion,

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.190
and a little bit of humor.

00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:59.710
And he said, oh dear, you're
not practicing mindfulness.

00:17:59.710 --> 00:18:02.400
He said, you're
practicing impatience

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:05.350
and frustration and judgment.

00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:06.730
And then he said
these five words

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.520
that really impacted my life.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.695
He said what we
practice gets stronger.

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.680
What we practice gets stronger.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.470
We know this now
with neuroplasticity.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:21.700
Your repeated experiences
shape your brain.

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.060
If you're paying
attention as you meditate

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.650
in a judgmental way,
in a self-critical way,

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:29.190
in a striving way,
in an impatient way,

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:34.800
you're creating those neural
pathways in your body.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:38.560
Mindfulness is about paying
attention with acceptance,

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.120
with openness, with
a sense of curiosity,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.770
where you're actually interested
in your own and other people's

00:18:44.770 --> 00:18:46.240
experience.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:51.340
With kindness, with
trust, compassion.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.400
So these are offered
more of like a heuristic,

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.120
but it's this general
sense of our attitude

00:18:56.120 --> 00:19:01.170
is very spacious, very
welcoming, very kind.

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:04.250
And as you practice relating
to yourself in that way,

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:08.460
that's how you start to
grow these new pathways.

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.000
Does that make sense?

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.150
I want to clarify, though.

00:19:12.150 --> 00:19:15.410
Mindfulness is not about
being happy all the time.

00:19:15.410 --> 00:19:16.240
Right?

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:20.570
What these qualities are is
they're kind of like a pot.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:22.570
And mindfulness is
this big pot that's

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:25.770
always kind and always
open and always curious.

00:19:25.770 --> 00:19:28.630
And you put whatever you're
feeling inside that pot.

00:19:28.630 --> 00:19:31.360
So maybe you're feeling really
frustrated at your child.

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:32.840
Or scared about them.

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:35.179
Or confused or lost.

00:19:35.179 --> 00:19:37.470
It doesn't mean you try to
get rid of that and be kind.

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:40.120
What it means is you hold
that emotion, that fear,

00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.830
with kindness and with
curiosity and with compassion.

00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:46.350
And say, what does it
feel like to be scared?

00:19:46.350 --> 00:19:49.150
What does it feel like to not
know what to do right now?

00:19:49.150 --> 00:19:52.391
And to really love this person?

00:19:52.391 --> 00:19:52.890
OK?

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:55.950
So these are the three elements
of mindfulness-- intention,

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:58.340
attention, and attitude.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.770
This is the Japanese
kanji of mindfulness.

00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:04.080
And the top character looks
like a hat, means presence.

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.970
The bottom character,
shin, means heart mind.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.630
They're interchangeable
in Asian languages.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:12.980
So mindfulness could have
been translated in the West

00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.570
as heartfulness.

00:20:15.570 --> 00:20:18.020
I don't think it would
have caught on as much.

00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:21.360
But think about-- in
fact, feel-- how different

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.595
it is to say heartfulness
instead of mindfulness.

00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:26.550
That's what this
practice is about.

00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.710
It's about this
heartful presence.

00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:33.110
So what I'd like to do is
practice for a very, very short

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:36.800
period, so that you can
actually try intentionally

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.870
paying attention in this
kind, open, heartful way.

00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:41.870
OK?

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:46.442
So go ahead and sit comfortably.

00:20:46.442 --> 00:20:48.400
I'm going to invite you
to put your cell phones

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:51.140
and computers on
a different chair.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.980
And make sure
they're off, please.

00:20:55.842 --> 00:20:57.300
They actually did
a study, and they

00:20:57.300 --> 00:21:00.490
found that even if your
cellphone is out, like that,

00:21:00.490 --> 00:21:02.460
while you're having
lunch with someone,

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.690
both people rate the lunch
as less satisfying and less

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:08.180
intimate, even if no one
looked at their cellphone.

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:09.080
Just having it out.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:11.850
And the fear that you
might get interrupted

00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.320
made it less intimate.

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.550
Now imagine how
our children feel.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:18.410
Imagine how our children
feel, knowing that

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:20.410
at any moment, what
they're saying to you

00:21:20.410 --> 00:21:23.890
is going to take less importance
than whatever is coming in

00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:25.406
on your phone.

00:21:25.406 --> 00:21:26.780
OK.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:27.860
Not to guilt you.

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:29.090
Do not go into guilt.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.070
Guilt actually
freezes the center

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:33.590
of the brain that
can make changes.

00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.560
Guilt is not helpful.

00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.010
We'll talk about that.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:37.550
So letting that go.

00:21:37.550 --> 00:21:40.730
And just allow
your eyes to close.

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:41.780
And just take a moment.

00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:43.380
We're just-- right now,
remember we're just

00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:44.630
learning how to pay attention.

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:46.580
So begin to gather
your attention.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:51.800
What you practice gets stronger.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:54.930
So right now, we're training
the skill of attention.

00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:57.490
So just gathering
your attention.

00:21:57.490 --> 00:22:00.970
And begin by just beginning
to feel your body.

00:22:00.970 --> 00:22:04.590
So gather your attention
into the toes of the feet.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.150
You can wiggle
them a little bit.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:11.240
And then into the ankles.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:16.095
And up both legs.

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.365
Connecting with your
seat and the chair.

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.460
Feel your pelvic
area and your hips.

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.960
And if your attention
wanders, no problem.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.210
Just bring it back.

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.250
We're just gathering right now.

00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.365
Training the mind in
how to pay attention.

00:22:43.550 --> 00:22:45.166
So coming up through the spine.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:51.706
And then relaxing the shoulders.

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:56.446
Pouring the awareness
down both arms.

00:22:59.060 --> 00:22:59.910
Into the hands.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:10.643
And then feeling the belly.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:16.070
See if you can soften the belly.

00:23:20.594 --> 00:23:22.010
And moving up
through the ribcage.

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.825
Into the chest.

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:34.840
And actually, see if you can
feel the beating of your heart

00:23:34.840 --> 00:23:35.495
in the chest.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:43.440
It might be helpful just to
put your hand on your chest

00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.125
and actually feel
the heart beating.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.520
And you can leave your
hand there for a minute

00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.030
or put it back in your lap.

00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.970
But staying connected
to this knowing

00:24:02.970 --> 00:24:07.030
that the heart is taking
care of you right now.

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.430
And you don't have
to think about it.

00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:12.680
You don't have to remember
to make it happen.

00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.020
It just knows what to do.

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:22.071
Sending oxygen and nutrients to
every cell in your body right

00:24:22.071 --> 00:24:22.570
now.

00:24:32.260 --> 00:24:33.635
And then letting
go of the heart,

00:24:33.635 --> 00:24:38.260
and coming up
through the throat.

00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:40.470
Feeling the back of
the neck lengthen

00:24:40.470 --> 00:24:43.900
as you tilt the chin
down just a millimeter.

00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:49.760
Bringing your attention
up the back of the head,

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.605
and the sides of the
head, and the ears.

00:24:56.490 --> 00:24:59.760
And then into the face.

00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.260
As you just soften the mouth.

00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:06.370
Soften your jaw.

00:25:06.370 --> 00:25:07.495
Soften your eyes.

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.180
Soften the forehead.

00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:16.865
Just letting your face rest.

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:28.370
And then getting a sense of
your whole body sitting here.

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:35.640
Feeling the awareness flowing
through the whole body.

00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.460
And see if you can
lean your attention

00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.930
a little bit down and
a little bit back.

00:25:39.930 --> 00:25:44.140
We tend to focus mostly forward
in the front of our body.

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.515
So leaning it down and back.

00:25:45.515 --> 00:25:47.810
So you're really centered.

00:25:47.810 --> 00:25:49.856
You have all your
resources available to you

00:25:49.856 --> 00:25:50.480
in this moment.

00:25:56.384 --> 00:25:58.175
And then just notice
that you're breathing.

00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:11.430
Feeling the breath as it
naturally flows in and out

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:12.040
of the body.

00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:23.400
And again, you don't
have to control it.

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.740
You don't have to think
about it or do anything.

00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:31.340
The breath knows what to
do, just like the heart.

00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:33.595
It's taking care of
you all the time.

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:59.050
See if you can be fully
present for just one breath.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:03.310
Really feeling it in your body.

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:06.932
Or even just half a
breath, just this inhale.

00:27:06.932 --> 00:27:08.620
Or just this exhale.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:29.090
And so the breath becomes our
anchor in the present moment.

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:35.040
It helps us stay
here where we are.

00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.710
And yet we're also open.

00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:41.870
So if we hear sounds,
we just notice hearing.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.800
Notice the impacts in our body.

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.140
And then let them go.

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:52.600
If thoughts come up and
begin to carry us away,

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.880
we notice thinking.

00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.470
And then we return
to our breath.

00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:02.660
Emotions, body sensations.

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.225
All of our experience
is welcome.

00:28:07.890 --> 00:28:10.890
Not necessarily because
we want it to be here,

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.740
but because it already is.

00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.490
We accept what is here,
because it already is here.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:22.260
How do I meet it in
the present moment?

00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:27.235
How do I see clearly
what's actually happening?

00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:42.190
So maybe just
noticing what it feels

00:28:42.190 --> 00:28:45.400
like to be alive right now.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.830
And relaxing the body 5% more.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.820
And at the same time,
heightening your attention.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.220
Really clarifying.

00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.450
Focusing the mind.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.620
You can be relaxed and alert.

00:29:11.620 --> 00:29:15.060
Your body can be
physiologically at ease,

00:29:15.060 --> 00:29:17.350
and your mind can have
laser-like attention.

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:32.060
So for the last two
minutes of this practice,

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.660
really infusing your
attention with the attitudes

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.140
of mindfulness.

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:46.413
With curiosity, and kindness,
openness, and acceptance.

00:30:00.250 --> 00:30:05.120
Trusting that you're
doing this right.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.650
And that it's unfolding
in the right way,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:10.030
and at the right pace for you.

00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:16.750
And just resting.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:18.243
You don't have to do anything.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.130
So as you're ready, taking
a deeper breath in and out.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.510
Beginning to bring
some gentle movement

00:30:40.510 --> 00:30:44.120
into the wrists and ankles.

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:49.630
You might want to stretch
your arms up above your head.

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:54.360
And let some light come
back in through the eyes.

00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:56.460
Good.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.460
And what I invite
you to notice is

00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:01.830
that even as the
meditation ends,

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:05.240
the mindfulness continues.

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.710
It's not over.

00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:09.730
You're still paying attention.

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:12.930
Still present.

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:15.580
Still seeing clearly.

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.010
So the meditation
is just a practice

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:19.990
to cultivate the mindfulness.

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:24.030
To develop these neural
pathways of presence

00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.710
so that we can bring them
into all aspects of our lives,

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:29.720
including parenting.

00:31:29.720 --> 00:31:30.750
OK?

00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:33.230
So bringing this
mindfulness, this presence,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:34.980
I'd like you to get
with one other person,

00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.950
just for a minute, and
just share something

00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.940
you noticed as we
did this exercise.

00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:44.060
Sharing from your
direct experience.

00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.810
So not, ooh, my mother-in-law
really needs to learn this,

00:31:46.810 --> 00:31:48.435
but what did you notice?

00:31:48.435 --> 00:31:49.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:49.570
Oh, good.

00:31:49.570 --> 00:31:50.450
You're alive.

00:31:50.450 --> 00:31:53.070
What did you notice as
we did this practice?

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.570
OK.

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:54.486
So just take a minute.

00:32:21.390 --> 00:32:23.100
So I'm curious.

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.850
What did you guys notice?

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.603
What did you notice
as you practiced?

00:32:32.502 --> 00:32:35.995
AUDIENCE: Like I'd never been
told or suggested to do that.

00:32:35.995 --> 00:32:38.487
Focus your attention
sort of down and back.

00:32:38.487 --> 00:32:40.153
As opposed to-- I
guess my natural thing

00:32:40.153 --> 00:32:41.194
would be leaning forward.

00:32:41.194 --> 00:32:42.762
And going.

00:32:42.762 --> 00:32:44.970
SHAUNA SHAPIRO: So he had
never focused his attention

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:45.720
down and back.

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.220
He's always kind
of leaning forward.

00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.140
Yeah.

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:48.266
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:49.890
And that made it a
little more grounded

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:51.709
and easier to stay
inside myself.

00:32:51.709 --> 00:32:52.750
So that's what I noticed.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:53.833
SHAUNA SHAPIRO: Beautiful.

00:32:53.833 --> 00:32:57.820
I find that a really helpful
practice, because all of us

00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:59.550
tend to be a little
bit forward, right?

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:01.450
And a little bit
up in our heads.

00:33:01.450 --> 00:33:04.100
And to just kind of
sink down and rest back.

00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:04.680
Great.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.739
What else?

00:33:06.739 --> 00:33:08.711
Yes.

00:33:08.711 --> 00:33:13.148
AUDIENCE: It's conscious effort
to push distracting thoughts

00:33:13.148 --> 00:33:14.015
out of your head.

00:33:14.015 --> 00:33:15.640
SHAUNA SHAPIRO: It's
a conscious effort

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.870
to push distracting
thoughts out of your head.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.130
And it's actually exhausting
and not really possible.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:22.830
So the invitation
with mindfulness

00:33:22.830 --> 00:33:26.410
is to notice the distracting
thoughts and then let them go.

00:33:26.410 --> 00:33:28.740
We're not pushing
them out of our head.

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.200
They're like waves in the ocean.

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.670
They're going to keep coming.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.110
And what we try to do is drop
down beneath them and look up.

00:33:35.110 --> 00:33:36.860
And we can see them
on the surface,

00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.262
but we're not getting
tossed about by them.

00:33:39.262 --> 00:33:40.830
Does that make sense?

00:33:40.830 --> 00:33:41.330
Yeah.

00:33:41.330 --> 00:33:44.080
Mindfulness is not about
being perfectly still

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.120
and empty of thoughts
all the time.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:48.000
It's not really realistic.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.630
There are more spaces.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.390
And there's periods like that.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:53.550
But there's also
periods of intensity.

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:57.006
And it just depends
on the moment, really.

00:33:57.006 --> 00:33:58.950
Yeah.

00:33:58.950 --> 00:34:00.720
What else?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.640
How many people noticed that
your mind wandered quite a bit?

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:05.256
Right, all of us.

00:34:05.256 --> 00:34:06.220
All of us.

00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:07.760
And that's why we practice.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:10.170
It's almost like we're
building a muscle, right?

00:34:10.170 --> 00:34:12.090
And I go to the gym
and I lift weights,

00:34:12.090 --> 00:34:14.790
not so that my
bicep gets bigger,

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.060
but so that I can come
home and pick my son up.

00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:17.560
Right?

00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.250
So we're practicing
mindfulness so

00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:22.275
that we have these
stronger parts of our brain

00:34:22.275 --> 00:34:27.780
and our being to be present for
ourselves and for our children.

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.540
So I want to move on a little
bit about now to the science.

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.685
And I'm noticing that we
don't have a ton of time.

00:34:34.685 --> 00:34:36.560
And so I'm going to skip
to just what I think

00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:39.719
is most interesting right
now in the field, which

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:43.699
is the effects of
meditation on the brain.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.179
So this is just some
basic science research.

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:48.270
It doesn't have to
do with meditation.

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:51.730
But if you imagine that
my fist is your brain--

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.949
I got this from
Dan Siegel, who is

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:57.550
a wonderful colleague
and mentor and friend.

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.460
So basically, we have the
kind of reptilian brain

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.610
stem that formed early on,
a lot of our fight or flight

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:04.650
mechanisms.

00:35:04.650 --> 00:35:06.310
And then we have the
prefrontal cortex

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.470
that formed around this part.

00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:10.900
And this is our
higher-order reasoning.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.170
This is our emotional
intelligence.

00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:16.130
This is the part
of the brain that

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.840
is most impacted by mindfulness.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.080
And so what you find is that
people who are feeling happy,

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.640
and alert, and
vibrant, and joyful,

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:27.460
when you look at
their brain, they

00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:30.560
have higher ratios of
left to right prefrontal

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.950
cortical activity.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:35.630
So the part of their brain--
the prefrontal cortex--

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:38.880
they have greater activity in
the left to right ratio when

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.750
they're feeling happy, alert.

00:35:40.750 --> 00:35:43.750
When you're depressed,
when you're anxious,

00:35:43.750 --> 00:35:46.440
you have greater activity
in the right to left ratio.

00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:46.960
OK?

00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.920
And even when you have
extreme depression,

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.780
post-traumatic
stress disorder, you

00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:53.620
can see this pattern
in a deeper way.

00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:57.580
So what they did is they
brought in 175 subjects

00:35:57.580 --> 00:35:59.070
to be tested in the laboratory.

00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:01.095
And this is this
wonderful Tibetan lama

00:36:01.095 --> 00:36:04.030
who's all hooked up
to these EEG monitors

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:06.720
so we can see what's
happening inside his brain.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:11.530
And what they found is that
this long-term meditator

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:15.250
had the highest left to right
ratio in his prefrontal cortex

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.210
that they had seen.

00:36:17.210 --> 00:36:20.240
And so they wondered, well, is
this just a random artifact?

00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:22.289
Like, was he was born
happy, and that's

00:36:22.289 --> 00:36:24.580
why he decided to go and
meditate for tens of thousands

00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:25.580
of hours?

00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:30.570
Or did the tens of thousands
of hours of practice, right,

00:36:30.570 --> 00:36:32.310
strengthen certain
parts of his brain

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:35.970
that had to do with happiness
and compassion and joy?

00:36:35.970 --> 00:36:38.280
So they did a randomized
control trial.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:43.469
They took 41 biotechnology
employees-- anyone can do this.

00:36:43.469 --> 00:36:44.010
Just kidding.

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:46.520
I shouldn't say that at Google.

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.280
And they taught them
meditation and compared them

00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:51.050
to a weightless control group.

00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:54.720
And what they found was at
the four-month follow-up,

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:56.680
there was significant
increase in this

00:36:56.680 --> 00:36:59.780
left to right activation.

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:02.870
So this is actually really
exciting and really hopeful

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:03.390
news.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.050
Because in
psychology, what we've

00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:08.570
learned over the
past four decades

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:11.610
is that we all have a
happiness set point.

00:37:11.610 --> 00:37:13.110
Just like someone
with their weight.

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:15.746
They can fluctuate
between 10 pounds or so,

00:37:15.746 --> 00:37:17.370
but you basically
have the kind of have

00:37:17.370 --> 00:37:18.920
the body you were born with.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.800
Well, when you're born, you
have a certain temperament.

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.200
And what they found is that
you have a baseline level

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:25.870
of happiness that
doesn't really shift

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.910
that much over your lifetime.

00:37:27.910 --> 00:37:29.810
And they based this
on research that

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.970
shows that if you
win the lottery,

00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:34.770
you have this spike in your
happiness-- which we'd expect--

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:38.670
and then within one year,
you're back to your baseline.

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.740
If you get in a terrible
accident and become paralyzed,

00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:45.040
you have a huge drop
in your happiness.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:48.631
And then one year later,
you're back to baseline.

00:37:48.631 --> 00:37:50.130
Those are shocking
results that have

00:37:50.130 --> 00:37:52.100
been repeated over and over.

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:55.500
So this is great news if
you're born happy, right?

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.920
You're like a Bobo doll.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:57.730
Stuff happens.

00:37:57.730 --> 00:37:58.600
You pop down.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.340
You pop back up.

00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:00.770
And it's no problem.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.740
OK?

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.720
For many people that I work
with, they were not born happy.

00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.910
And then this is really,
really depressing news.

00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:10.070
It's like, well, even
if I win the lottery,

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:12.931
or I marry the perfect person,
or I get the house in Hawaii,

00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:14.430
within one year I'm
going to be back

00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:17.720
to this level of depression?

00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:19.560
So what this research
is showing us

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:24.040
is that even though changing
our external circumstances

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.590
can't change our
overall happiness level,

00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:29.050
changing our
interior environment,

00:38:29.050 --> 00:38:31.960
our interior landscape, can.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:34.810
This is very hopeful.

00:38:34.810 --> 00:38:36.580
Richie Davidson and
Matthieu Ricard,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.550
who is the principal
investigator of the study,

00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:40.530
he says, "Happiness
can be trained

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:46.130
because, the very structure
of our brain can be modified."

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:50.290
So what he's talking about
here is neuroplasticity,

00:38:50.290 --> 00:38:51.880
as I mentioned earlier.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.160
Our repeated experiences
shape our brain.

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.550
What you practice gets stronger.

00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:59.410
What you're
practicing right now.

00:38:59.410 --> 00:39:02.690
If you're spacing out, that
pathway's getting stronger.

00:39:02.690 --> 00:39:04.210
If you're interested
and curious,

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:05.620
that pathway's getting stronger.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:06.517
And I'll never know.

00:39:06.517 --> 00:39:08.850
I mean, I kind of can tell
from your eyes and your pupil

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:11.440
dilation, but I'm
not really looking.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.510
So what I think becomes
so hopeful and optimistic

00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:18.050
is the sense of, like,
you have a choice.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:19.880
And every moment's important.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:23.050
Every moment, as you're with
your child, is important.

00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:24.530
Not only for you, but for them.

00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:27.460
Because our mirror neurons,
they're getting shaped.

00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.750
We're shaping our own brain.

00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:31.800
And we're shaping their brains.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:34.930
And so there's no
moments that don't count.

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:36.600
There's no breaks.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.800
Not to put pressure on you.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.170
But there's no breaks.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.770
Every moment matters equally.

00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:45.510
In every moment you're
creating a pathway.

00:39:45.510 --> 00:39:48.130
These are brains from
Harvard, actually,

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:51.610
so that makes them
kind of special.

00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:54.170
They looked at many
meditators' brains.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:56.910
And they looked at the
parts of the brains that

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.750
got bigger and stronger
through meditation practice.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:01.170
So when you look
at taxi drivers,

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:03.794
if you look at their brains,
the visual spatial mapping parts

00:40:03.794 --> 00:40:05.210
get big and strong,
because that's

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:06.330
what they're doing all day.

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:07.704
When you look at
meditators, what

00:40:07.704 --> 00:40:09.516
they find is the parts
of the brain that

00:40:09.516 --> 00:40:11.590
have to do with
attention, learning,

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.470
emotional intelligence,
self-awareness,

00:40:13.470 --> 00:40:14.230
they get bigger.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.980
They get stronger.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:16.680
It's called cortical thickening.

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.430
And the more you
practice, the bigger,

00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:22.720
the more cortical
thickening there is.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.930
This is very hopeful news.

00:40:24.930 --> 00:40:30.100
We have the technology,
right, the meditation practice

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:33.200
as technology, to
change our brain.

00:40:33.200 --> 00:40:36.730
To change the actual structure
toward greater happiness,

00:40:36.730 --> 00:40:40.489
towards greater
ease and compassion.

00:40:40.489 --> 00:40:42.030
So I like to think
of this as like we

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:44.990
have these superhighways
of habits, right?

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:47.420
And they're really fast.

00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.130
You know what yours are.

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:50.390
OK?

00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:53.470
And what mindfulness
does is it says,

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.660
is that really in alignment
with your highest values?

00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.820
Is that really getting
you in the direction

00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.480
you want to be heading?

00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:03.070
And we have this opportunity
to kind of dig out

00:41:03.070 --> 00:41:04.940
these little country
roads of compassion,

00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.200
or patience, or presence.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.540
And I could go this
way, right, with my son.

00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.248
I could have been
like, Jackson, come on,

00:41:11.248 --> 00:41:12.990
we're going to the beach.

00:41:12.990 --> 00:41:15.240
Impatience is one
of my pathways.

00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.370
Or I could pause,
and just kind of

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.890
go this other route, which
maybe doesn't feel as familiar.

00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:25.530
But every time I start going
down that route of patience

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.060
or of kindness, I'm
strengthening it.

00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.010
So the next time,
right, there's not

00:41:30.010 --> 00:41:31.650
as many brambles and bushes.

00:41:31.650 --> 00:41:33.230
It's a little cleared.

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.330
Does that makes sense?

00:41:35.330 --> 00:41:40.050
So the question really becomes,
what do you want to practice?

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:41.400
What is your intention?

00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:44.030
What is the most
important thing to you?

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.300
And so this brings us
to mindful parenting.

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:52.720
And these are the five elements.

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:55.030
And these are kind
of invitations

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.940
of what to practice.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:42:00.130
And so our book really
goes through these

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:01.230
in a lot of detail.

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.950
And I'm just going to plant
a seed and offer them to you.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:09.640
But these five pathways are--
I'll go through each of them,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.140
actually.

00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.040
The first one, and
most important one,

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.890
is unconditional love.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.330
Practicing that pathway.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:15.900
Connecting.

00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:18.040
Building the relationship.

00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.630
Nothing matters if you
don't have the relationship.

00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:23.870
And nothing is worth it if it
costs you the relationship.

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:25.500
If disciplining your
child and getting

00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:28.210
them to do what you want in that
moment costs the relationship,

00:42:28.210 --> 00:42:29.660
it's not worth it.

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.940
So the foundation is
unconditional love.

00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.740
The sense that
there's nothing that

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.420
will stop me from loving you.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.130
Whether you score the goal
or whiff the penalty kick.

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:43.770
Get an A or an F. Behave
well or arrogantly.

00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.920
I will always love you,
and stay connected to you

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.520
through thick and thin.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:51.810
That sense that you're
not going anywhere.

00:42:51.810 --> 00:42:54.700
This is the foundation
of mindful parenting.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:43:00.720
And this is the most
important thing.

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:03.620
Another important element
that we practice is space.

00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:06.420
Allowing our children
space to be themselves.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:10.250
We often micromanage as parents.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:11.950
And we think we know best.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:14.820
And we think they have
to go on this pathway.

00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:16.650
And I know for me,
I'm a professor,

00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.720
and everyone in my
family is professors.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.459
And the intellectual mind
is very highly valued.

00:43:22.459 --> 00:43:24.500
Whereas the emotional
intelligence and the heart,

00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.960
not so much.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.910
And when I chose to have my
son go to a Waldorf school,

00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:31.877
I remember family
members saying, well,

00:43:31.877 --> 00:43:33.460
is he ever going to
learn how to read?

00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:38.340
And so I was like, no
problem, no problem.

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.660
And then here my son
is eight years old,

00:43:40.660 --> 00:43:42.460
does not know how to read.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:46.600
And there is this moment
in me where I was like,

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:50.600
maybe I shouldn't have given
him this much space and trusted.

00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:52.969
And yeah, he's speaking
Mandarin and Arabic

00:43:52.969 --> 00:43:54.510
and playing guitar
and all the stuff,

00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:56.415
and he doesn't know how to read.

00:43:56.415 --> 00:43:57.790
And I remember
going and speaking

00:43:57.790 --> 00:43:59.450
with the headmaster
of the school,

00:43:59.450 --> 00:44:01.590
and she was just like,
trust the process.

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:04.110
Trust this innate
organic capacity

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:05.710
that our children have.

00:44:05.710 --> 00:44:06.915
Give him space.

00:44:06.915 --> 00:44:09.980
And there's lots of
encouragement and guidelines.

00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:11.080
And now he's nine.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.100
He's reading perfectly.

00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.464
It's no problem.

00:44:13.464 --> 00:44:15.880
I don't know what would have
happened if he hadn't learned

00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.270
now and I had to give this talk.

00:44:18.270 --> 00:44:20.610
But there's something about
giving our children space

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:22.730
to become themselves, and
trusting that process.

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.520
Healthy limits.

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.370
This is the other side of space.

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:32.580
It is so important
for our children

00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:36.380
to have something to push
up against, some limits.

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.160
When parents are
overly permissive,

00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.210
when parents don't
set boundaries,

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:43.450
it actually creates a lot
of fear for our children.

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:45.560
Physiologically,
it creates fear.

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:47.730
It's like, well,
who's in charge?

00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:50.220
Who knows what's
right and wrong?

00:44:50.220 --> 00:44:52.050
And I know for me,
I'm a single mother.

00:44:52.050 --> 00:44:55.730
And my ex-husband, he was
kind of the disciplinarian,

00:44:55.730 --> 00:44:58.580
and I was like the
sweet mommy loving one.

00:44:58.580 --> 00:45:01.829
And then when of a sudden,
I was having to be both,

00:45:01.829 --> 00:45:02.870
I didn't do it very well.

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:06.010
I didn't create very much
boundaries for my son.

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:09.410
And after about two years,
my son was ruling our house.

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:09.910
Right?

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:10.735
He was this little dictator.

00:45:10.735 --> 00:45:11.460
He was like six years old.

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:13.240
He was like, this
is what we're doing.

00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:15.390
And I'm like, OK.

00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:17.655
And that's when I
decided to actually start

00:45:17.655 --> 00:45:19.030
doing the research
for this book.

00:45:19.030 --> 00:45:20.230
Because I was like, wait.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.370
Discipline can't be all bad.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:26.240
There has to be some
ways to create boundaries

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.690
where I'm the mom
and he's the child,

00:45:28.690 --> 00:45:31.030
and he gets to be the child.

00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:34.470
It is so important to let
our children be children.

00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.480
And so healthy limits
is about really

00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:42.010
from a place of clarity and love
and wisdom, setting the limits.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:44.679
Not from a place of you're bad.

00:45:44.679 --> 00:45:45.220
You're wrong.

00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:46.306
I'm taking away my love.

00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:48.430
When we get to that point
and we're setting limits,

00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:49.730
that's not healthy.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.870
We want to set the limits
from a place of spaciousness

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.240
and openness and I love you.

00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.570
That's when the limits create
so much healing, and allow

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.090
our children to learn how
to discipline themselves.

00:46:01.090 --> 00:46:02.680
Oh, this makes sense.

00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:03.900
I can trust Mom.

00:46:03.900 --> 00:46:04.740
I can trust Dad.

00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:06.390
They know what
they're talking about.

00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:08.808
And they're doing this
because they love me.

00:46:08.808 --> 00:46:10.260
OK?

00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:13.460
So when we say no to
a particular behavior,

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.850
we do our best to simultaneously
say yes to our child.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:18.340
And that's what's
most important,

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.329
is they don't feel like
the no has anything

00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:22.370
to do with your love and
your connection to them.

00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:27.860
Modeling and mentorship
are another thing

00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:31.380
that we practice with
mindful parenting.

00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:33.250
Who you are.

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:36.570
Who you are teaches your
child more than anything.

00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:38.320
Who you are as
you're driving along.

00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:40.810
Who you are as you're checking
out at the grocery store.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:42.210
Are you making eye contact?

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:43.050
Are you present?

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:45.112
Are you on your phone?

00:46:45.112 --> 00:46:47.070
We're going to talk about
self-compassion soon,

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:47.720
don't worry.

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:56.260
But our children, the way we
learn is by watching others.

00:46:56.260 --> 00:47:00.780
We are incredibly elegantly
wired with our mirror neurons

00:47:00.780 --> 00:47:03.550
to actually feel what
other people are feeling,

00:47:03.550 --> 00:47:08.180
and adapt in that way so
that we become like them.

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:12.020
So how we are in the
world impacts our children

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:14.880
more than anything
we say to them.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.070
What we model.

00:47:17.070 --> 00:47:18.530
And then mentoring our children.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:20.820
Actually spending
time with them.

00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:25.400
And offering them the skills
and knowledge that they need.

00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.710
When I talk about
my son not learning

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:29.360
to read until he
was nine, it wasn't

00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.230
that we weren't doing anything.

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:33.680
I mean, we had a
lot of structures

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:35.027
in place to support him.

00:47:35.027 --> 00:47:36.610
But there wasn't the
anxiety and there

00:47:36.610 --> 00:47:39.080
wasn't the forcing behind it.

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.280
So there can still
be mentorship.

00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:44.870
And he and I, since he was
born, I've read to him an hour

00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:46.237
every single night.

00:47:46.237 --> 00:47:48.320
And so even though he still
is not a great reader,

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:51.470
his vocabulary is amazing.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.970
All right.

00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:53.970
The last thing I want to
talk about is mistakes.

00:47:53.970 --> 00:47:56.900
And for me, this has been
the most important thing,

00:47:56.900 --> 00:48:01.410
is to recognize that
mistakes are natural.

00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:03.080
They're part of parenting.

00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.950
And they can, in fact, lead to
greater intimacy and greater

00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:07.180
healing.

00:48:07.180 --> 00:48:09.850
This path of parenting is
not about doing it right.

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.650
It's not about being perfect.

00:48:12.650 --> 00:48:15.200
If there was a way to do
that, I would tell you.

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.050
I would.

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:20.530
It's one of the most
humbling experiences.

00:48:20.530 --> 00:48:22.290
Continues to be
the most humbling

00:48:22.290 --> 00:48:25.160
experience I've
ever had in my life.

00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.830
And one of the most painful.

00:48:26.830 --> 00:48:32.110
One of the most
requiring of compassion.

00:48:32.110 --> 00:48:37.470
So mistakes give
us the opportunity

00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.410
to acknowledge our
own limitations,

00:48:39.410 --> 00:48:43.180
and then to demonstrate to
our child how we repair.

00:48:43.180 --> 00:48:44.470
How we repair.

00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:47.470
The most important thing,
when we make a mistake,

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.360
is to acknowledge it.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:51.630
And to say I'm sorry.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.540
And to really be in
that vulnerability

00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:59.100
as a parent, which
is challenging.

00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:03.660
So by modeling this
for our children,

00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.680
we model the idea that you
don't have to be perfect,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:10.970
and that you're loved
for who you are.

00:49:10.970 --> 00:49:13.230
There's this sense
in our culture--

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:16.570
that I think is pretty
pervasive-- that somehow I'm

00:49:16.570 --> 00:49:18.340
not doing it right.

00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.420
Somehow I'm not OK.

00:49:19.420 --> 00:49:21.570
I'm not quite doing this
parenting thing right.

00:49:21.570 --> 00:49:23.901
I'm not quite doing
this life thing right.

00:49:23.901 --> 00:49:24.400
Right?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:25.970
Like I haven't figured it out.

00:49:25.970 --> 00:49:29.030
And what's wrong with me?

00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:30.820
Tara Brock, who's a
wonderful teacher,

00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:33.720
she calls it this
trance of unworthiness.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:35.820
That somehow there's
something wrong with me.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:40.240
Or other people have figured
something out that I haven't.

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.660
And I think this
causes a lot of harm.

00:49:42.660 --> 00:49:44.460
We want to model
for our children

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.910
it's OK to not be perfect.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:48.580
It's not just OK, it's normal.

00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.180
It's natural.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.270
It's healthy.

00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:52.650
So this is from Jack Kornfield.

00:49:52.650 --> 00:49:57.540
He says, "If you can sit
quietly after difficult news.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:01.500
If in financial downturns
you remain perfectly calm.

00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.130
If you see your neighbors
travel to favorite places

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:06.030
without a tinge of jealousy.

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:09.160
If you can happily eat
whatever is put on your plate.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:12.840
If you can love everyone around
you unconditionally, and be

00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:18.860
content wherever you are--
you are probably a dog."

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:20.000
Right?

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:23.830
We hold ourselves to these
levels of perfection.

00:50:23.830 --> 00:50:25.550
We think we should
be feeling this way.

00:50:25.550 --> 00:50:27.820
I should be happy all the time
and love my son all the time.

00:50:27.820 --> 00:50:29.570
Feel like being a mom's
the greatest thing

00:50:29.570 --> 00:50:31.320
in the entire
world all the time.

00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.740
Find me a mom like that.

00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.850
Find me a dad like that.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:37.480
And yet we're so
afraid to acknowledge

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:40.410
the humanness of parenting.

00:50:40.410 --> 00:50:42.710
And I think one of the
most important dimensions

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.430
of mindful parenting
is this authenticity.

00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:50.480
Is our own tender hearts as
parents, our own vulnerability,

00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:51.205
our own fears.

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:59.330
The Dalai Lama, who has inspired
me so deeply in my life--

00:50:59.330 --> 00:51:00.790
there's the story about him.

00:51:00.790 --> 00:51:02.500
It was from many,
many years ago.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.380
I wasn't there at the time.

00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:06.470
But someone asked
him, they said,

00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:09.730
Your Holiness, how do you deal
with these judgmental thoughts?

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:12.230
This kind of feeling like you're
never quite doing it right.

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:13.380
You're never quite good enough.

00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:15.588
Like you should be faster,
and more patient, and more

00:51:15.588 --> 00:51:17.430
compassionate,
and more generous.

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:18.880
What do you do with all that?

00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:23.290
And the Dalai Lama looked
at it him, and he said,

00:51:23.290 --> 00:51:25.582
those thoughts are wrong.

00:51:25.582 --> 00:51:27.040
Imagine the Dalai
Lama saying that.

00:51:27.040 --> 00:51:28.414
It's even hard
for me to imagine.

00:51:28.414 --> 00:51:30.380
Usually he's so, like,
joyful, and laughing,

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.320
and tee hee hee, that's
such a funny question.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:33.403
But he said, that's wrong.

00:51:33.403 --> 00:51:37.380
He said, imagine that a
young child was reaching out

00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:40.250
to take a hot coal
and burn his hand.

00:51:40.250 --> 00:51:42.910
You would say,
no, don't do that.

00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:44.830
He said, these thoughts
are like your mind

00:51:44.830 --> 00:51:46.690
reaching out and taking
hold of a hot coal.

00:51:46.690 --> 00:51:48.670
And they're burning you.

00:51:48.670 --> 00:51:51.400
And they're not leading to
anything wholesome or skillful.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:55.130
So you take your hand
off those thoughts.

00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:59.310
With mindfulness, we practice
self-compassion and kindness.

00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:02.400
And when those thoughts
arise, which they will.

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.530
We have many
superhighways of habit,

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:06.600
of that judgemental thought.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.160
We hold ourselves
with compassion.

00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.284
And we say, no, sweetheart.

00:52:09.284 --> 00:52:11.690
I'm not going to
let you do that.

00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:14.350
And what's interesting is that
a lot of times people say, well,

00:52:14.350 --> 00:52:17.700
don't I have to have those
thoughts to keep my A game up,

00:52:17.700 --> 00:52:20.810
or to change and be a better
parent, or a better person,

00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:23.020
or a better worker,
colleague, wife?

00:52:23.020 --> 00:52:25.660
And actually, as I
was saying earlier,

00:52:25.660 --> 00:52:28.220
the parts of the brain
that actually can learn

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:32.660
new behaviors, they shut down
when you're self-conscious

00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:34.470
and you feel ashamed.

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:38.000
So if you actually want
to change your behavior,

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.460
it comes through compassion
and through inspiration.

00:52:41.460 --> 00:52:44.371
If you actually want to
change your child's behavior,

00:52:44.371 --> 00:52:45.620
it's not through shaming them.

00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:47.828
Oh my god, I can't believe
you hit your sister again.

00:52:47.828 --> 00:52:50.200
You're the worst little
boy I've ever met.

00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.281
That's not going to teach
him a new way of being.

00:52:52.281 --> 00:52:53.530
That's going to shut him down.

00:52:53.530 --> 00:52:57.440
That's going to freeze
him in fight or flight.

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.670
So the way we parent
is through compassion,

00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:02.920
through inspiration,
through kindness.

00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.520
And we, in some ways, have
to re-parent ourselves.

00:53:06.520 --> 00:53:08.760
It doesn't work to shame
and blame ourselves

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:10.330
into being a good parent.

00:53:10.330 --> 00:53:11.420
I've tried it.

00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:14.480
It doesn't work.

00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:18.300
What works is seeing
things clearly.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:18.800
Right?

00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.510
That's the definition
of mindfulness.

00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:26.170
Seeing clearly so I know
how to respond effectively.

00:53:26.170 --> 00:53:28.835
That's the only tool we
really have, is our presence.

00:53:31.923 --> 00:53:32.422
OK?

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:38.430
So the word
"compassion" in Tibetan

00:53:38.430 --> 00:53:40.240
always includes oneself.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:45.980
It's considered incomplete if
it doesn't include oneself.

00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:47.565
Think about that for a moment.

00:53:50.260 --> 00:53:53.290
So many times I hear parents
who are so overextended,

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:56.590
and so exhausted, and so
burnt out, and just-- I can't.

00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.250
I can't deal with
all this anymore.

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.520
That's not really
acting with compassion,

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.500
because you have to include
yourself in the family system.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:08.100
So learning to take
care of yourself,

00:54:08.100 --> 00:54:11.464
even if it requires a little
less time with your children,

00:54:11.464 --> 00:54:12.005
is essential.

00:54:14.860 --> 00:54:15.890
And it's hard.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:18.102
We work with all these
different things of guilt,

00:54:18.102 --> 00:54:19.560
and how much time
should I be here,

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.680
and how much time-- And,
again, through mindfulness you

00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.070
find your own right balance.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:29.160
What's most true for you.

00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:32.280
On my CD there's a meditation
called metta meditation,

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.610
or loving kindness.

00:54:33.610 --> 00:54:37.120
And it's a really
nourishing way to practice

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.120
kindness for yourself,
and cultivating

00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:40.860
that neural pathway.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:43.820
And then offering it to your
children, and to your spouse,

00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:46.770
and to your family, and
out into the greater world.

00:54:46.770 --> 00:54:49.490
And I think
combining mindfulness

00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:52.340
with compassion practices
is really useful.

00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.520
So that not only are
we seeing clearly,

00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:58.664
but we're also cultivating
the heart and the mind.

00:54:58.664 --> 00:55:00.330
So I want to be
respectful of your time.

00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:04.120
And I just want to thank you all
for your very kind attention.

00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.590
And maybe I will just
stay up here for questions

00:55:07.590 --> 00:55:08.630
since we're at time.

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:11.500
And if you want to ask specific
questions, come and see me.

00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:12.450
My CD is right there.

00:55:12.450 --> 00:55:13.370
My book's over there.

00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:13.970
And thank you.

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:14.870
Thank you.

00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:16.420
[APPLAUSE]
