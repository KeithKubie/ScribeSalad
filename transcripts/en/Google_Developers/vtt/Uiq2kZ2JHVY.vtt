00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
Hi, my name is Lisa
Wray, and I want

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.020
to talk to you about
some huge changes we've

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.410
made in how notifications work
in the L developer preview.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.440
The changes give
developers tons of options

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.260
to make notifications way
better for your users.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:16.010
Now that they appear front and
center on the L lock screen,

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.940
and Android Wear watches,
creating great notifications

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.510
is more important than ever.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.880
With the L developer preview, we
introduce Google's new material

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.220
design language.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.620
Material design isn't
limited to Android apps.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.490
It also encompasses the system
UI, including notifications.

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.570
So here's a notification
screen in Jelly Bean

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.880
and another in the
L developer preview.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.660
Notifications are now on a
light background with dark text

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.910
and there are also some
typographic and graphic design

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.056
changes.

00:00:43.056 --> 00:00:45.430
If you've been following our
guidelines since Jelly Bean,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.650
your notifications small
icon should already

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.150
be white with alpha.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.206
In L, we expect
this, and we draw it

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:55.030
on top of a circular background
whose color you can customize.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.660
When you add a large it
will turn your small icon,

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.084
and it's colored backdrop,
into a badge on the large icon,

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:02.500
rather than sending it over
to the other side of the view,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.050
as in previous releases.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.010
If you're using
Notification.Builder,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.940
or notification compat,
then these changes

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.440
are taken care of for you.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.670
And your notification
should display correctly,

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.380
on both pre L and
L preview builds.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.924
However, if you're using
custom notifications,

00:01:17.924 --> 00:01:19.340
you'll need to
update your layouts

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.900
to match the new format.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.590
So we encourage
you to use builder

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.210
to make notifications,
if at all possible.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.980
In addition to
visual changes, we've

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.890
merged the notification
shade, something

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.479
we've in Android since
1.0, with the lock screen.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.020
One of the most
common reasons people

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.810
take out and unlock their phones
is to respond to notifications.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.920
Now content is immediately
accessible and interactive.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.450
You can double tap to access or
swipe to dismiss right there.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.980
And as a developer,
you get this for free.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.830
It's the default behavior in L.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.827
Of course, security is something
we take very seriously.

00:01:53.827 --> 00:01:56.160
We don't want to expose
anything that should be private.

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.260
So we've added visibility
for notifications.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.370
There are three levels.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.430
The first, which is the default
for all existing notifications,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.400
is private, meaning the contents
won't be shown on lock screens.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.580
You can provide a public
version of your content

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.900
or the system will make
a generic one for you.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.850
There's also public,
meaning the notification

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.141
is always shown, no matter
whether the screen is locked

00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:19.752
or not, and secret meaning
if your screen is locked,

00:02:19.752 --> 00:02:21.210
then we won't show
the notification

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.670
on the lock screen at all.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.210
Users can also enable or disable
their lock screen notifications

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.670
completely, and decide if
they want notifications

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.670
be kept private or not.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.120
Also new an L are
heads up notifications,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.020
a way for the system UI to
put important information

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.940
in front of the user, without
disrupting their activity.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.905
When the screen
is on and unlocked

00:02:42.905 --> 00:02:45.030
important notifications
will be automatically shown

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.370
as heads up.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.350
For example, notifications
that currently

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.190
use a full screen [INAUDIBLE]
or high priority with a sound

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.730
or vibration like phone
calls, will become

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.910
heads up notifications
while the phone is in use.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.060
After a few seconds,
they slide away,

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.820
so you can continue
playing or reading,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.370
and will move into the
notification bar-- for example,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.660
to say call missed,
or alarm snoozing.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.010
And we've had notification
priority since Jelly Bean.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.850
But it's especially
important now

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.690
to take a look at your
apps notifications

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.860
and classify them appropriately.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.680
Many default priority
notifications

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.840
are probably better expressed
as low or minimum priority,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.950
or possibly high priority, if
the message is truly urgent.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.300
We've also added
notification categories.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.610
It's OK not to
specify a category.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.730
But some examples of
top priority messages

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.890
that should have one
are incoming calls,

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.960
instant messages, or alarms.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:38.070
And we're fleshing out
notification extras,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.710
which were added in Kit Kat.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.990
In particular, we want to
help you see information

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.790
about the people you care about.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.200
So you can add a list
of the people associated

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.030
with a notification,
identified by content provider

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.300
your eyes, so the Android system
could surface notifications

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.930
from your favorite contacts.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.550
And it's especially
important now

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.900
that your app use only
the notification features

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.320
to play sounds and vibrate.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.430
Please don't work around
the notification manager

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.020
to vibrate or play
your own sounds.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.620
With all these options, we've
given users a convenient way

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.200
to configure
notifications for any app.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.700
You can add a flag to your
notification settings activity

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.620
in the manifest to have it
listed in the app notification

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.750
section of the
system settings up.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.089
Also, lock screens in
the L developer preview

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.320
no longer show controls for
your remote control client.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.950
Instead, your app can provide
media playback control

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.670
from the lock screen
to your notification.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.730
And there's a new media style
template just for this purpose.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.990
Finally, don't forget
the notification options

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.330
already available
for Android Wear.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.370
Your app's existing
notifications

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.860
automatically transfer
to the watch for free.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:46.700
But with just a little
bit of extra code,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:51.080
you can get support for
pages, stacks, voice replies.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.400
Conversely, if you don't
want your app's notifications

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.620
on the watch, you can
use set local only true.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.330
And this, like the
new media style,

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:00.380
is available both in
the notification class

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.300
and in the support library.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.000
So that's a lot.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.810
What should you, as
an app developer,

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.700
go do right now to get your
notifications ready for L?

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.320
Use Notification.Builder or
create new layouts for pre

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.570
and post L. Pick an accent
color for your notifications,

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.420
because that's new.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.830
Decide what visibility you
want your notifications to be.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.300
And if it's not
public, then think

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.030
about what you'd like to
show on the lock screen.

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.570
Add a flag in the manifest to
get your notification setting

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.710
activity listed in
the system settings.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.160
And if you don't have a
notification setting activity,

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:36.660
go make one.

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.580
And finally, if you
have notifications,

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:41.090
your app is already
on Android Wear today.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.835
So make sure it's working
the way that you want.

00:05:43.835 --> 00:05:45.835
If you don't have a watch
yet, use the emulator.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.840
And you can get started today
with all of these new features

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.640
by downloading the Android
L developer preview.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.500
And check out the
docs on notifications

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.070
on developer.android.com.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.895
Thanks for watching.
