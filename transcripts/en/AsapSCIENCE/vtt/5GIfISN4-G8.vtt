00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.170
You produce between two - three pints of urine
every day, but most of us still pay little

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.360
attention to our liquid waste. So, what does
your pee say about you? And could it be a

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.089
clear indicator of your body's overall health?

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.320
Before you pee, the kidneys filter water soluble
waste by absorbing the nutrients it needs

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.210
to keep, like sugar, back into your body,
and getting rid of the things your body doesn’t

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.880
want, like toxins. The liquid waste then flows
to your bladder where it is stored until eventually

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.920
being peed out.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.980
If your urine is brown, it could be from eating
a lot of rhubarb, fava beans or aloe. It is

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.320
also a side effect of some medications such
as laxatives, muscle relaxants and antibiotics.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.840
More seriously it can be a sign of liver disorder
or kidney disease.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.739
If you’re seeing purple, you may be suffering
from a rare inherited disorder known as porphyria.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:50.110
Porphyrias cause your body to be deficient
in the enzymes which produce heme, an essential

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.820
part of red blood cells.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.250
Green urine? It could be from a new medication
or vitamin. Some green food dyes don’t get

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.640
absorbed by your body and can be excreted
in your urine, so a green stream is not always

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.110
something to be alarmed about, especially
after St. Patrick's day.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.820
If your urine is blue, you likely have familial
hypercalcemia, an inherited disorder found

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.210
in children which is caused by excess calcium
in the blood also known as blue diaper syndrome.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.950
Some medications have methylene blue in them
which can cause urine to turn blue / green.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.250
If your urine is pink or red, there may be
blood in the urine. This could be due to a

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.750
variety of conditions from an enlarged prostate,
bladder cancer or even chronic lead poisoning.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.000
But red urine can also be caused by different
types of medications or from eating richly

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.020
coloured foods like beets and blackberries.
In fact beeturia is the technical term for

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.610
peeing pink after eating too many beets.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.250
If your urine is orange, it could be from
eating excessive amounts of food containing

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.640
high levels of vitamin C or carotene such
as carrots. It’s also caused by drugs, like

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.830
a painkiller called Pyridium given to people
with urinary tract infections which turns

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.530
urine bright orange.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.770
Normally, urine should be a shade yellow,
and it gets this yellow colour from the pigment

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.390
of urobilin, which is a product of the breakdown
of heme, an essential part of your blood.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.280
Depending on how much water you have in your
body your urine will either be diluted or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.090
concentrated with urobilin. Honey coloured?
It means your body has reabsorbed a lot of

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.989
water to keep you hydrated so now there is
a higher concentration of urobilin in your

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.310
urine making your pee appear amber coloured.
You need to drink water right now. Dark yellow,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.849
this is normal, but there is more urobilin
so you will want to drink water soon. No colour

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.650
at all means you have been drinking a lot
of water. It could also mean you have consumed

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.750
caffeine or alcohol which inhibits the ability
for your body to reabsorb liquid in the kidney,

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.590
meaning you pee out way more water.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:54.099
Transparent yellow, you’re normal and healthily
hydrated.
