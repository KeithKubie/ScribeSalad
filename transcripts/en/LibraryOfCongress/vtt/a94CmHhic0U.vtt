&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Wait one more 
minute, and then we'll get 

00:10:53.255 --> 00:10:55.255
started.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  One awkward minute.

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:35.026
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  All right, well, 
thanks for coming, everybody.  

00:11:35.027 --> 00:11:39.339
We're going to get started.  Um,
I'm just here to introduce Jer. 

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.578
Welcome to the Library of 
Congress and to this very 

00:11:41.579 --> 00:11:43.579
special addition of Artist in 
the Archive.

00:11:46.275 --> 00:11:48.310
I'm  Abby Potter, I'm the acting
chief of the Library of Congress

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:51.989
Lab, which is also known as  
National Digital Initiatives, 

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:54.068
and I have the pleasure to 
introduce our host for tonight, 

00:11:54.069 --> 00:11:57.553
the wonderful Jer Thorp.  He 
comes to us from New York City 

00:11:57.554 --> 00:11:59.554
by way of Vancouver.

00:12:02.064 --> 00:12:03.899
He's an artist and educator 
exploring the many boundaries 

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.946
between science, art and 
culture.  His work has been 

00:12:06.947 --> 00:12:08.947
published in many 

00:12:10.005 --> 00:12:12.027
magazines, like magazines.  He 
was the data artist and 

00:12:12.028 --> 00:12:14.284
residence at the New York Times 
and is a National 

00:12:19.834 --> 00:12:22.685
Geographic fellow, a  
Rockefeller Foundation fello and

00:12:22.686 --> 00:12:24.686
co-founder of the Office of 
Creative Research.

00:12:29.393 --> 00:12:31.694
Jer is also the current 
innovator Innovator-in-Residence

00:12:31.695 --> 00:12:35.761
here at the library.  He is part
of a program to bring people 

00:12:35.762 --> 00:12:37.762
here with creative ideas and a 
wide array of experiences and 

00:12:39.067 --> 00:12:41.067
backgrounds to do new and 
interesting 

00:12:43.175 --> 00:12:45.013
things with our collections of 
data.  In his time with us, he 

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.014
has certainly done this.

00:12:48.691 --> 00:12:50.740
He has wrangled our MARC records
and made beautiful and 

00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:53.177
thoughtful entryways into our 
collections, he's traversed all 

00:12:54.396 --> 00:12:56.620
of our tunnels and made friends 
with people he's come across, 

00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:59.274
and he's exposed the vastness 
and  smallness of this 

00:12:59.275 --> 00:13:03.564
institution.  He's applied his 
talents to translating the 

00:13:03.565 --> 00:13:07.860
intangibles of the Library of 
Congress to an audience that may

00:13:07.861 --> 00:13:09.699
not know that much about us, and
this podcast is a great example 

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.700
of that, and I'm really  looking
forward to 

00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:17.102
tonight's episode, and, um, as 
we go about the recording, since

00:13:17.103 --> 00:13:21.212
we are live streaming, just if 
you can wait to applause at his 

00:13:21.213 --> 00:13:21.825
signal, and he says it will be 
obvious.

(Laughing.

00:17:43.496 --> 00:17:45.496
All right, well, there's going

00:17:48.629 --> 00:17:49.547
Hello, and welcome to another 
episode of the Artist in the 

00:17:49.548 --> 00:17:53.431
Archive.  If you've already been
listening to our podcast, you 

00:17:53.432 --> 00:17:55.469
probably know what to expect, 
but for all new listeners, let 

00:17:57.302 --> 00:17:59.302
me take a minute to catch up.

00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:01.433
I'm Jer Thorp, a writer and 
teacher and artist from 

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:05.083
Brooklyn.  Last year, they asked
me to come here and spend six 

00:18:05.084 --> 00:18:07.084
months as the 
Innovator-in-Residence.

00:18:10.215 --> 00:18:11.423
This invitation was exciting and
nebulous enough that I jumped at

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.685
the opportunity, and since 
October, I've been wondering 

00:18:14.686 --> 00:18:16.686
through the halls, thinking 
about how the institution's 

00:18:17.958 --> 00:18:21.289
enormous data stores might be 
put to novel and creative uses. 

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.853
Along the way, I've talked to so
very many interesting people and

00:18:23.854 --> 00:18:26.306
have had the chance to see so 
very, very many interesting 

00:18:26.307 --> 00:18:29.982
things.  Now, this podcast is a 
chance to share those 

00:18:29.983 --> 00:18:31.609
interesting things and people 
with you and to share the work 

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:33.610
I've been doing.

00:18:35.087 --> 00:18:37.552
Now, this episode is a little 
bit different.  For starters, 

00:18:37.553 --> 00:18:42.872
I'm recording this in front of 
an audience.  Hi, everyone.  

00:18:42.873 --> 00:18:44.101
We're also doing this in the 
grand surroundings,  well, much 

00:18:44.102 --> 00:18:46.102
grander 

00:18:48.454 --> 00:18:50.454
surroundings than at home in 
Brooklyn.

00:18:51.755 --> 00:18:54.637
We're in the Jefferson Building 
at the Library of Congress.  

00:18:54.638 --> 00:18:56.638
It's kind of an amazing room, 
right?

00:18:57.895 --> 00:18:59.729
Let me see, how can I describe 
it to you, all of you who aren't

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:02.574
here?  Oh, I know, Joel, can you
describe it for us?

00:19:03.393 --> 00:19:05.393
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Why not?

00:19:09.496 --> 00:19:11.325
I would say that this high 
ceiling room, first of all, it's

00:19:11.326 --> 00:19:13.802
rectangular, about the size of 
one-half of a tennis 

00:19:18.523 --> 00:19:20.668
court, each wall is topped by a 
white railing, as one might see 

00:19:20.669 --> 00:19:22.669
on a balcony.

00:19:24.070 --> 00:19:26.046
Below it a long strip of white, 
extending along each side of the

00:19:26.047 --> 00:19:31.498
room.  Below this ornamental 
prop are square panels in two 

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:33.499
shades of yellow.

00:19:35.175 --> 00:19:37.175
Lighting is set behind, glowing 
toward the ceiling.

00:19:39.091 --> 00:19:41.741
Five rows of chairs with a 
center aisle are set facing a 

00:19:41.742 --> 00:19:44.205
platform with two  chairs.  
Behind this arrangement is a 

00:19:44.206 --> 00:19:46.206
large 

00:19:47.452 --> 00:19:49.288
wood cabinet, flanked on the 
left by the United States flag, 

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:51.749
and on the right, by the blue 
flag of the Library of Congress.

00:19:52.971 --> 00:19:54.971
To the left of the U.S.

00:19:58.642 --> 00:20:00.557
flag is an exit, and then a 
candle candleobruwith three 

00:20:00.558 --> 00:20:02.775
glowing lights, highlighting a 
head and shoulders 

00:20:06.838 --> 00:20:08.838
portrait of a stern-faced 
gentleman.

00:20:10.962 --> 00:20:13.414
To the right of the flag is a 
glass case with wood supporters 

00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:15.415
on display, 

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.666
and then a  sculpture in black.

00:20:19.736 --> 00:20:21.736
The sculpture depicts a male and
a 

00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.327
female nude, in an embrace, sans
kiss, while seated.  The man's 

00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:33.642
right arm rests on the female's 
left thigh.  The left side of 

00:20:33.643 --> 00:20:35.643
the room features three glass 
case displays.

00:20:39.985 --> 00:20:42.420
In the center, a violin cello 
flanked by two cases, each 

00:20:42.421 --> 00:20:44.421
containing a violin.

00:20:46.511 --> 00:20:49.386
The right side of the room has 
four rectangular windows windows

00:20:49.387 --> 00:20:51.387
with French doors in the center.

00:20:54.088 --> 00:20:57.575
The doors are set beside a 
taught wrought-iron gate.  On 

00:20:57.576 --> 00:20:59.576
each side of the gate, at center
is 

00:21:00.613 --> 00:21:04.367
the delegate wrought-iron design
of a violin.  At the rear of the

00:21:04.368 --> 00:21:06.400
room is a black sculpture of two
nudes.

00:21:09.905 --> 00:21:11.531
At left, a female is on her 
knees, reaching up in the 

00:21:11.532 --> 00:21:14.388
embrace and kiss of a seated 
male.  Behind this display is 

00:21:14.389 --> 00:21:17.889
the ramp you may have used to 
enter the room.  On the wall to 

00:21:17.890 --> 00:21:19.890
the right of the ramp 

00:21:23.504 --> 00:21:25.504
is a tapestry, depicting a 
forest scene 

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:29.231
with eight individuals in 
medieval dress.  The room is 

00:21:29.232 --> 00:21:31.533
carpeted in a blue and green 
floral pattern, with pink 

00:21:32.564 --> 00:21:34.619
blossoms, and finally, for this 
presentation, two large screen 

00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:37.472
displays are at the left and 
right of the 

00:21:41.738 --> 00:21:43.738
platform in the front of the 
room.

00:21:44.586 --> 00:21:46.621
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Joel is a true 
pioneer in the field of audio 

00:21:46.622 --> 00:21:50.513
description.  For almost 40 
years, he's been describing 

00:21:50.514 --> 00:21:52.755
events for the blind and 
visually-impaired.

00:21:56.021 --> 00:21:58.875
To pick just a few of the 
projects, they've produced audio

00:21:58.876 --> 00:22:00.947
descriptions for sesame Street, 
the National  Park 

00:22:04.023 --> 00:22:06.023
Service, and for the 
presidential 

00:22:07.718 --> 00:22:09.583
inauguration parades in 2009 and
2013.  Tell me a little bit 

00:22:09.584 --> 00:22:13.464
about audio description.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, thank you.  

00:22:13.465 --> 00:22:15.465
I'm happy to, because it's, 
ironically 

00:22:16.676 --> 00:22:18.676
enough, it's

00:22:20.085 --> 00:22:22.986
a technique that needs 
visibility visibility.  The 

00:22:22.987 --> 00:22:24.987
title of my book on audio 

00:22:27.682 --> 00:22:30.121
description, published in in 
2014, is The Visual Made Verbal,

00:22:30.122 --> 00:22:32.122
and that's what description is.

00:22:34.788 --> 00:22:36.788
It's a translation of visual 
images to 

00:22:38.729 --> 00:22:40.955
words, succinct words that are 
imaginative, to convey that 

00:22:40.956 --> 00:22:43.416
visual image of television, of 
film, of theater, of 

00:22:47.198 --> 00:22:49.034
dance, of opera, museum 
displays, to, um, a significant 

00:22:49.035 --> 00:22:51.035
population.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:54.660
In this country alone, there are
over 

00:22:55.812 --> 00:22:58.479
21 million Americans who are 
either blind or, to quote 

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.480
American Foundation 

00:23:03.611 --> 00:23:05.611
of Blind, or have trouble 
seeing, even with correction.

00:23:07.514 --> 00:23:09.514
21 million, that's 8 percent of 
the population.

00:23:10.156 --> 00:23:11.795
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, we're going 
to hear from Joel a few times 

00:23:11.796 --> 00:23:15.078
today.  One of the things I 
discovered from recording this 

00:23:15.079 --> 00:23:17.368
podcast about the library and 
all the amazing objects is just 

00:23:17.369 --> 00:23:19.807
how difficult it is to give a 
good description of things, and 

00:23:19.808 --> 00:23:21.808
I knew that 

00:23:23.074 --> 00:23:24.533
people who were  lissing to the 
podcast who might not be able to

00:23:24.534 --> 00:23:28.001
see what we're talking about or 
to look at a picture would 

00:23:28.002 --> 00:23:29.839
benefit tremendously from Joel's
work, so thank you, Joel, and 

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:32.485
we'll hear from you a little bit
later.  Now, of all the  

00:23:32.486 --> 00:23:36.410
mysterious and wonderful nooks 
and crannies of this place, 

00:23:36.411 --> 00:23:38.890
perhaps the most delightful, and
certainly the most intriguingly 

00:23:38.891 --> 00:23:40.891
named is 

00:23:42.610 --> 00:23:44.610
the catburg feed, home to the 
library's poetry department.

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:48.504
The room overlooks the Grand 
Hall to one side and the roof of

00:23:48.505 --> 00:23:50.536
the Capitol to the other.  In 
summary, I think it's fair to 

00:23:50.537 --> 00:23:53.579
see that our first guest has one
of the best  offices in the 

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.067
world.  Robert is head of the 
poetry and literature center of 

00:23:57.068 --> 00:23:59.898
the Library of Congress.  Hello,
Robert, and welcome to Artist in

00:23:59.899 --> 00:24:02.562
the Archive.  Come on up.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Hi.

00:24:10.014 --> 00:24:12.014
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, Robert, your 
permanence 

00:24:13.059 --> 00:24:15.502
is different department is 
different from a lot of the 

00:24:15.503 --> 00:24:19.386
others, not only because you 
have the best office, um, but 

00:24:19.387 --> 00:24:20.997
also because, unlike all the 
other departments, or most of 

00:24:20.998 --> 00:24:23.681
the other departments, you're 
not necessarily a collecting 

00:24:23.682 --> 00:24:27.775
department.  If I go up to the 
poetry office, I'm not going to 

00:24:27.776 --> 00:24:29.776
find stacks and stacks of 
poetry.

00:24:31.516 --> 00:24:32.539
Instead, maybe, I'm going to 
find poets.

00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.540
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You may.

00:24:37.222 --> 00:24:39.222
You'll definitely find us, but 
there 

00:24:40.878 --> 00:24:42.878
are a number of divisions in 
terms of 

00:24:44.134 --> 00:24:46.134
the library that are not 
collection- collection-based.

00:24:46.186 --> 00:24:48.186
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Can you tell us, I 
think 

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:53.957
all of us have heard, um, about 
the poet laureate, but we might 

00:24:53.958 --> 00:24:57.433
have some confusion as to what 
they do.  Can you tell us what 

00:24:57.434 --> 00:25:00.093
the poet laureate does?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The poet laureate 

00:25:00.094 --> 00:25:04.416
position was originally called 
the consultant in poetry 

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:06.260
position, it was established 
around 80 years ago by the 

00:25:06.261 --> 00:25:08.919
Library of Congress.  Um, it was
changed by an act of 

00:25:12.185 --> 00:25:15.041
Congress in 1985 to the current 
title, the poet laureate 

00:25:15.042 --> 00:25:17.697
consultant in poetry at the 
Library of Congress, a real  

00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:19.896
mouthful.

00:25:21.365 --> 00:25:23.365
Um, the poet laureate, according
to 

00:25:25.864 --> 00:25:28.119
the law, is selected by the 
librarian of Congress based 

00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.977
entirely on merit, and there 
isn't really anything that a 

00:25:29.978 --> 00:25:32.662
poet laureate has to do in the 
position.

00:25:35.735 --> 00:25:37.967
We usually have them give an 
opening reading and a closing 

00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:40.672
talk to kick off our literary 
season in September and end 

00:25:42.102 --> 00:25:43.729
things at the end of April, 
beginning of May, but other than

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:45.730
that, really, the 

00:25:47.027 --> 00:25:49.872
laureate serves as an ambassador
for the art and represents the 

00:25:49.873 --> 00:25:51.873
office and the 

00:25:52.878 --> 00:25:54.844
library.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And you've had some

00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.845
pretty 

00:26:00.953 --> 00:26:02.953
amazing American poets as poet 
laureate.

00:26:06.073 --> 00:26:08.720
The most recent poet laureate, 
Tracy Cay Smith.  I didn't ask 

00:26:08.721 --> 00:26:10.576
you here to talk about poet  
laureates though, I asked you 

00:26:10.577 --> 00:26:12.577
here 

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.558
to show everybody and to talk 
about maybe my favorite object 

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:18.559
that I've had 

00:26:22.069 --> 00:26:24.112
the chance to see while I've 
been here, and this is sitting 

00:26:24.113 --> 00:26:27.178
on the table in front of us, and
what it is, actually, why don't 

00:26:27.179 --> 00:26:29.237
you tell us what it is?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Sure.

00:26:32.918 --> 00:26:34.918
Um, when I started at the 
library 

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.525
about seven years ago, I found 
this book in one of the, um, 

00:26:39.526 --> 00:26:41.526
drawers of the old 

00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:45.420
furniture that we had given to 
us 

00:26:48.136 --> 00:26:48.956
notably in the early 40s, the 
person for whom this room is 

00:26:48.957 --> 00:26:53.038
named.  This is a book that says
on its cover,  Poets Corner.

00:26:56.323 --> 00:26:59.004
I opened it up to realize that 
it has all the days of the year 

00:26:59.005 --> 00:27:01.005
and signatures 

00:27:03.352 --> 00:27:05.193
of, um, various poets and 
writers and even a few Library 

00:27:05.194 --> 00:27:07.194
of Congress staff who 

00:27:08.476 --> 00:27:10.517
have been up in the office for 
events or what have you, and it 

00:27:10.518 --> 00:27:12.518
covers, basically, 

00:27:15.016 --> 00:27:16.844
the 80 years of the office's 
history.  So, you have all sorts

00:27:16.845 --> 00:27:20.513
of wonderful things, and you 
have a lot of people who aren't 

00:27:20.514 --> 00:27:21.737
famous in there.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Let's take a moment

00:27:21.738 --> 00:27:23.738
to describe this book, Joel.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Sure.

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.218
This is a small diary, 
rectangular shaped, situated 

00:27:31.219 --> 00:27:36.110
vertically.  The edges of its 
brown front are slightly worn, 

00:27:36.111 --> 00:27:38.111
although it is adorned 

00:27:39.388 --> 00:27:41.388
with gold ornamentation, lines 
that frame the shape.

00:27:43.503 --> 00:27:46.373
To the right at center is a 
brass lock.  At bottom in gold 

00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:48.416
lettering, Poets Corners.  The 
book's pages are lined 

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.504
horizontally, and at the top of 
each page is the month and date.

00:27:55.811 --> 00:27:57.811
At the top left of each page is 

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:02.079
printed the number 19.

00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.754
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, yeah, so, this 
object fascinates me, and I'll 

00:28:04.755 --> 00:28:09.264
tell you why.  It's because, um,
every poet who has done a 

00:28:09.265 --> 00:28:12.925
reading at the library has 
signed this book.  Well, let's 

00:28:12.926 --> 00:28:15.777
say most of them, an awful lot 
of them.

00:28:15.778 --> 00:28:19.243
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And they signed it 

00:28:19.244 --> 00:28:22.989
across the span of many, many 
decades.  Do you know what the 

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:24.990
earliest signature in the book 
is?

00:28:25.638 --> 00:28:27.638
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think the 
earliest 

00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:31.528
signature is from the early 40s,
but I wouldn't know whose it was

00:28:31.529 --> 00:28:33.529
or when it 

00:28:35.904 --> 00:28:38.164
was, but I think we discovered 
one from 1941 or 42.

00:28:39.179 --> 00:28:40.826
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, along with 
that, you might have a signature

00:28:40.827 --> 00:28:42.827
from last week, and the way the 
book is organized, and 

00:28:46.178 --> 00:28:47.802
by the way, it's called Poets 
Corner, I love this, what this 

00:28:47.803 --> 00:28:52.133
was intended for was for a poet,
and the poet would write, they 

00:28:52.134 --> 00:28:54.170
would write their poetry in it, 
sort of day by day, and it would

00:28:54.171 --> 00:28:56.171
be 

00:28:57.215 --> 00:28:59.215
a way to collect your poems, but
instead 

00:29:01.904 --> 00:29:05.146
of doing that, you've collected 
poets in this book.  Every page 

00:29:05.147 --> 00:29:07.659
in this book is a day in the 
year, 365 pages, and they're all

00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:10.564
signed by different people.  So,
if we picked a page at random, 

00:29:12.738 --> 00:29:13.138
Robert, can you pick a page at 
random?

00:29:13.139 --> 00:29:15.139
(Laughing.

00:29:16.139 --> 00:29:21.098
)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, this is April 

00:29:21.099 --> 00:29:23.099
3rd.  It's one of the pages that
doesn't 

00:29:26.616 --> 00:29:28.616
have a  marker, but, um, in 
1959, on 

00:29:32.668 --> 00:29:35.450
April 3rd, Robert Frost was here
.  The problem with a lot of 

00:29:35.451 --> 00:29:38.784
these signatures is they're 
really hard to read.

00:29:45.123 --> 00:29:47.588
Gary Gilsner was here from Iowa.
It was first signed in 1953 by a

00:29:47.589 --> 00:29:52.688
woman named Christine whose last
name I cannot read from New 

00:29:52.689 --> 00:29:53.524
York, New York.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And we could page 

00:29:53.525 --> 00:29:56.382
through this book, and you'll 
have a chance to take a look at 

00:29:56.383 --> 00:29:59.468
it afterwards for the people in 
the audience, and we'll post as 

00:29:59.469 --> 00:30:02.323
many pictures as we can for the 
people who are listening along, 

00:30:02.324 --> 00:30:07.441
um, when I was, when I saw this 
book the first  time, I think we

00:30:07.442 --> 00:30:09.442
picked three pages, 

00:30:11.554 --> 00:30:13.554
more or less at random.

00:30:14.582 --> 00:30:16.738
On the second page was Robert  
Frost, and on the third page, 

00:30:16.739 --> 00:30:18.739
three lines apart 

00:30:21.111 --> 00:30:23.836
from each other were Alan 
Gisburg and Paul  Simon, and 

00:30:23.837 --> 00:30:25.837
what I love about the book is 
that it offers these connections

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.692
between people that you, as 
somebody who knows American 

00:30:31.693 --> 00:30:33.967
poetry inside and out, or me, as
somebody who does not know 

00:30:37.831 --> 00:30:39.831
American poetry very well, um, 
can, in 

00:30:41.323 --> 00:30:42.178
our minds, kind of come up with 
a connection between these 

00:30:42.179 --> 00:30:45.440
poets.  One of the things that 
we're going to be talking about 

00:30:45.441 --> 00:30:48.299
throughout the course of this 
podcast are things that act 

00:30:50.972 --> 00:30:52.972
exactly like this book.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:56.505
They're things that act as a 
kind of instrument to play a 

00:30:56.506 --> 00:30:58.506
wide collection of, 

00:31:03.286 --> 00:31:05.286
in this case, kind of poets and,
um, and their work.

00:31:12.681 --> 00:31:15.103
Um, one of the, um, most 
interesting things that I, um, I

00:31:15.104 --> 00:31:19.457
imagine about this, and this is 
where I get a little bit, I was 

00:31:19.458 --> 00:31:21.458
going to use the word poetic, 
it's not the right word.

00:31:22.081 --> 00:31:24.165
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Feel free.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  On a day like 

00:31:24.166 --> 00:31:27.256
today, can we find today in the 
book?  We have this instrument 

00:31:27.257 --> 00:31:29.701
which allows us to kind of 
conjure a list of poets, 

00:31:33.183 --> 00:31:35.663
and in my head, um, these poets 
would be sitting together in 

00:31:35.664 --> 00:31:37.499
this room, and they would have a
kind of dialogue with each 

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.193
other.  Who do we have today?

00:31:45.282 --> 00:31:47.282
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Today, we have Tom 

00:31:50.185 --> 00:31:52.185
Stoperned from 1982 and Wilbert 
Snow 

00:31:53.188 --> 00:31:55.188
from

00:31:59.934 --> 00:32:02.246
1961, M Travers from 1954, and a
lot of other people who 

00:32:05.519 --> 00:32:06.756
just have terribly legibility.
(Laughing.)

00:32:06.757 --> 00:32:08.177
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Various other 
people.  It's actually a pretty 

00:32:08.178 --> 00:32:10.178
full day.  It's one of those 
days that makes it 

00:32:14.913 --> 00:32:16.750
hard for, um, contemporary 
readers to find a place to sign.

00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:21.401
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It would be a 
crowded day in the Catburg feed,

00:32:21.402 --> 00:32:23.454
if we were going to get all of 
them together.

00:32:28.198 --> 00:32:31.055
Um, one question that I, um, 
that I wanted to ask you is, 

00:32:31.056 --> 00:32:33.056
it's sort of 

00:32:34.927 --> 00:32:36.581
related to this, but it's more 
of a discussion about a new 

00:32:36.582 --> 00:32:39.455
position that you've, I think 
just this year, um, come 

00:32:43.537 --> 00:32:45.396
up with, which is the, um, is it
called the youth poet laureate?

00:32:45.397 --> 00:32:48.078
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  It's not our 
position.

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:50.790
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Oh, it's not?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  No, no, and in 

00:32:50.791 --> 00:32:52.791
fact, for 

00:32:54.473 --> 00:32:56.473
many years, um, we avoided 
having 

00:32:58.207 --> 00:32:59.443
anything to do with other poet 
laureate positions because of 

00:32:59.444 --> 00:33:03.363
the fact that we have this law 
that established our position, 

00:33:03.364 --> 00:33:05.364
and it is a U.S. position.

00:33:09.131 --> 00:33:11.131
So, this year, we featured the 

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:15.090
national youth poet laureate, 
part of a 

00:33:18.445 --> 00:33:20.715
program that comes from New York
City, a nationwide program.  We 

00:33:20.716 --> 00:33:22.716
featured the first ever youth 
poet 

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.202
laureate, giving the opening 
reading for 

00:33:28.092 --> 00:33:28.708
our new poet laureate,  Tracy 
Kay Smith, so that was a big 

00:33:28.709 --> 00:33:30.709
deal.

00:33:33.010 --> 00:33:35.666
We've also been subsequently 
featured at youth  events, 

00:33:35.667 --> 00:33:37.667
including one coming 

00:33:39.608 --> 00:33:41.608
up in just a week, but one of 
the great 

00:33:45.535 --> 00:33:46.970
joys of this job is that the, 
and of the institution is the 

00:33:46.971 --> 00:33:50.671
opportunity to champion the work
that other organizations are 

00:33:50.672 --> 00:33:53.158
doing, other individuals are 
doing to promote poetry, 

00:33:56.231 --> 00:33:58.231
because the laureateship, and 
because 

00:34:01.294 --> 00:34:03.294
the library is so

00:34:05.743 --> 00:34:08.430
instrumental to our creative 
life and a sort of understanding

00:34:08.431 --> 00:34:12.847
of what libraries do.  So, it's 
a great place to bring people 

00:34:17.604 --> 00:34:19.549
like Amanda Gorman, who's a real
firecracker of a first youth 

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:23.529
poet laureate, to the library.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If people do want 

00:34:23.530 --> 00:34:26.926
to get involved with what the 
poetry department is doing, you 

00:34:26.927 --> 00:34:28.927
have a blog which you've 

00:34:31.085 --> 00:34:34.390
been running since 2012 that you
can find at  blogs.llc.

00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:39.115
gov/catburg, right?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yep.

00:34:40.133 --> 00:34:41.981
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And are there any 
interesting events coming up?

00:34:41.982 --> 00:34:43.982
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.

00:34:48.079 --> 00:34:50.737
April 19th, our current poet 
laureate, Tracy Kay Smith, will 

00:34:50.738 --> 00:34:52.992
give her closing, really, more 
of a talk, and for the 

00:34:57.132 --> 00:34:59.132
first time, it'll be followed by
a 

00:35:01.585 --> 00:35:03.585
monitored discussion

00:35:04.688 --> 00:35:06.688
.  It should be a really 
noteworthy event.

00:35:09.132 --> 00:35:11.422
In the room across the way.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I have one more 

00:35:11.423 --> 00:35:14.876
question, and this is a selfish 
one.  Have you thought about 

00:35:14.877 --> 00:35:17.760
getting this book digitized?

00:35:21.846 --> 00:35:23.846
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, no, but, um, I 
was 

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.853
seated next to one of your 
guests who I talked to about 

00:35:27.854 --> 00:35:29.279
maybe repairing the book a 
little bit, because there's a 

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.548
page that's coming out, and it 
could use a little love.

00:35:33.980 --> 00:35:36.472
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, you just give
me the best cue responsible for 

00:35:36.473 --> 00:35:38.292
our next guest.  Thank you, 
Robert.

00:35:38.293 --> 00:35:40.293
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  My pleasure.
(Applause.

00:35:42.117 --> 00:35:44.117
)

00:36:10.092 --> 00:36:12.540
(Singing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That was the 

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.541
transition you should have heard
earlier.

00:36:17.430 --> 00:36:19.430
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Better late than 
never.

00:36:19.927 --> 00:36:20.557
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This is the next 
transition.

00:36:20.558 --> 00:36:22.558
(Singing.

00:36:23.567 --> 00:36:25.567
)

00:36:49.669 --> 00:36:52.933
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  He was an 
extraordinary man, not in the 

00:36:52.934 --> 00:36:54.934
least for the figure he cut.

00:36:58.256 --> 00:37:00.256
He'd often be spotted wearing a 
broad 

00:37:01.318 --> 00:37:04.013
black hat, a long cigarette 
holder with a long cigarette.  

00:37:04.014 --> 00:37:06.251
He worked in his pajamas, 
wearing a turbine and a yellow 

00:37:06.252 --> 00:37:08.295
dressing gown, with red slippers
that turned up at the toes.

00:37:13.003 --> 00:37:15.438
He wrote, or so it's told only 
by the light of 41 candles.

00:37:21.196 --> 00:37:23.196
Our next guest is Adrienne, who 
is a 

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.123
senior photo conservator.  
Adrienne, welcome to Artist in 

00:37:27.124 --> 00:37:29.124
the 

00:37:30.184 --> 00:37:32.633
Archive speak.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you so much. 

00:37:32.634 --> 00:37:33.848
It's an honor.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Now, you have had a

00:37:33.849 --> 00:37:35.849
chance 

00:37:38.713 --> 00:37:41.904
to dig into Haulenhollenday's 
career.  Can you tell us the 

00:37:41.905 --> 00:37:44.351
story about how that happened?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, it started 

00:37:44.352 --> 00:37:46.352
because I 

00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.440
work here at the library, and we
have 

00:37:50.473 --> 00:37:53.125
the best collection of Holenday 
probably in the world, we have 

00:37:53.126 --> 00:37:55.393
the largest, for sure, 
collection, it came directly 

00:37:55.394 --> 00:37:57.394
from 

00:38:00.088 --> 00:38:02.132
his estate, and I became very 
interested in just learning 

00:38:02.133 --> 00:38:04.788
about how people, I wanted to do
a project where I, um, 

00:38:08.904 --> 00:38:10.548
created a material-based catalog
to really show how people could 

00:38:10.549 --> 00:38:13.204
look at photographs as  objects,
not just as 

00:38:17.302 --> 00:38:19.302
images, and the collection 
really stood 

00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:22.583
out as something that had 
incredible 

00:38:24.258 --> 00:38:26.258
depth, and, so, I was awarded a 

00:38:29.205 --> 00:38:31.244
fellowship in 2012 to really 
look into his  work, and as a 

00:38:31.245 --> 00:38:35.146
conservator, I did that in a 
materials way, so looking at all

00:38:35.147 --> 00:38:37.998
of his papers and the way he 
mounts things and how he 

00:38:37.999 --> 00:38:39.999
processes things and 

00:38:41.943 --> 00:38:44.389
everything, so I looked at all 
700, well, before, we had 

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:46.390
730-something, and 

00:38:49.112 --> 00:38:51.112
now, we have found 
750-something.

00:38:51.762 --> 00:38:53.762
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, in total, you 
have --

00:38:55.251 --> 00:38:55.659
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  752 at my last 
count.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.660
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Okay.

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.960
So, we have a few of the, we 
tried to 

00:39:02.657 --> 00:39:04.089
get the prints here, but they're
very important.

00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.543
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  They needed an 

00:39:06.544 --> 00:39:09.815
armed escort or something like 
that, and we didn't want guns in

00:39:09.816 --> 00:39:11.816
this room, so we said no.
(Laughing.)

00:39:12.269 --> 00:39:14.821
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We're going to show
you, um, some digital images, 

00:39:14.822 --> 00:39:16.822
and, um, Joel is going to 
describe a couple of them 

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:22.730
for us, but not this particular 
image.  I know you picked a few 

00:39:22.731 --> 00:39:24.731
images that represent a kind of 
span --

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:27.822
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, things that 
he's known to have photographed 

00:39:27.823 --> 00:39:29.823
in his career, kind of periods 
of his work.

00:39:32.544 --> 00:39:34.544
So, this one is, um, he's known 
for 

00:39:36.432 --> 00:39:38.432
male nudes, and this male nude 
was made 

00:39:39.915 --> 00:39:41.915
probably in 1898, 1899, and it's
of 

00:39:45.081 --> 00:39:47.131
someone that we imagine, well, 
the archival record doesn't 

00:39:47.132 --> 00:39:52.415
really tell us all that much, 
but we imagine that they were 

00:39:52.416 --> 00:39:54.416
probably lovers, or he 
definitely 

00:39:55.468 --> 00:39:57.468
had a romantic interest in this 
fellow.

00:39:58.743 --> 00:40:00.743
So, this is Thomas Harris, and 
he's in 

00:40:04.261 --> 00:40:06.507
the pose of a dying slave, 
inspired by Michelangelo's Dying

00:40:06.508 --> 00:40:08.508
Slave.  I always loved this 
piece.

00:40:09.593 --> 00:40:11.835
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And this image?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This is what he's 

00:40:11.836 --> 00:40:13.836
most known for, which is his 
focus on sacred 

00:40:16.747 --> 00:40:18.747
subjects, where he reenacted the
passion 

00:40:20.423 --> 00:40:22.423
of Christ, and, so, on the cross
here, 

00:40:24.716 --> 00:40:26.716
you see Holenday  himself, and 
he, um, 

00:40:28.375 --> 00:40:30.375
kind of created this cross and 
crucified 

00:40:34.081 --> 00:40:36.543
himself, like, with ropes, but, 
well, he was very zen anyway, 

00:40:36.544 --> 00:40:39.534
but he grew his beard and his 
hair, and he reenacted the 

00:40:43.219 --> 00:40:46.041
road to Cal very, the 
crucifixion, and you can show 

00:40:46.042 --> 00:40:48.727
the next one, which is, I think 
the last words of Christ, so the

00:40:51.176 --> 00:40:53.176
last thoughts that Christ 
thought, dying 

00:40:55.485 --> 00:40:57.485
on the cross, and then he also 
did the resurrection.

00:40:58.675 --> 00:41:00.675
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Joel has a 
description for this image.

00:41:02.359 --> 00:41:04.359
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This is a series of
seven 

00:41:07.910 --> 00:41:10.150
crucifixion images set out 
horizontally, but each is 

00:41:10.151 --> 00:41:12.385
focused on the head of the 
bearded Christ, wearing a crown 

00:41:12.386 --> 00:41:14.386
of thorns.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:20.122
The images are set between 
drawings of columns.  From left 

00:41:20.123 --> 00:41:22.123
to right, Christ, with eyes 

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:26.510
reflecting a forlorn weariness 
gazes off into the right.

00:41:29.435 --> 00:41:31.062
Then to the left, downcast, and 
to the right with eyes closed, 

00:41:31.063 --> 00:41:33.063
with his mouth 

00:41:34.149 --> 00:41:37.641
and eyes open wide.  I'll turn 
to the left and up.  Then with 

00:41:37.642 --> 00:41:43.116
eyes cast downward.  Next, with 
his head back and eyes closed, 

00:41:43.117 --> 00:41:45.117
lips slightly parted, and 

00:41:46.196 --> 00:41:47.626
finally, with eyes closed and 
his head lying on his right 

00:41:47.627 --> 00:41:49.627
shoulder.

00:41:52.349 --> 00:41:55.193
The column  Words appear.  
Father, forgive them, they know 

00:41:55.194 --> 00:41:57.194
not what they do.

00:42:00.712 --> 00:42:02.962
Today, thou shall be with me in 
paradise.

00:42:11.348 --> 00:42:13.348
My God, my God, why has thou 
forsaken me?

00:42:19.525 --> 00:42:21.525
Into thy hands, I commend my 
spirit.  It is finish finished.

00:42:24.018 --> 00:42:26.276
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This image is so 
striking.

00:42:27.102 --> 00:42:29.102
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Isn't that 
incredible?

00:42:32.002 --> 00:42:34.002
I'm just fascinated by this.

00:42:36.088 --> 00:42:38.088
This image was done, um, as 
Holenday 

00:42:39.767 --> 00:42:42.408
had, in 1904, a, like, 
catastrophic studio fire, and he

00:42:42.409 --> 00:42:46.296
lost many of his prints and most
of his negatives in that fire, 

00:42:46.297 --> 00:42:48.297
and most people consider his 
career over at that point, but, 

00:42:49.997 --> 00:42:52.872
actually, I think that the work 
that he does after that studio 

00:42:52.873 --> 00:42:56.972
fire is even more spectacular 
than the work that he did before

00:42:56.973 --> 00:42:58.973
it, and this image comes a year 
after that studio fire.

00:43:04.156 --> 00:43:06.156
So, he went to, um, the  Hampton

00:43:07.225 --> 00:43:10.130
Normal and Agricultural School 
in  Hampton, Virginia, which is 

00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:12.131
now Hampton  University, and he 
took photographs 

00:43:15.664 --> 00:43:17.664
there of the faculty and the 
students.

00:43:18.745 --> 00:43:20.610
They had a camera club, so he 
went to work with the students 

00:43:20.611 --> 00:43:23.274
there, and I just think the 
images from Hampton are some of 

00:43:23.275 --> 00:43:25.275
his best.

00:43:26.953 --> 00:43:28.953
I love how she's so, um, 
shadowed in 

00:43:30.845 --> 00:43:32.466
the front, and then the girl 
behind her is, like, luminous.

00:43:32.467 --> 00:43:35.517
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And Joel has a 
description of this image as 

00:43:35.518 --> 00:43:37.354
well, because I think it's just 
wonderful.

00:43:37.355 --> 00:43:40.224
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  A black and white 
photograph, rectangular and set 

00:43:44.285 --> 00:43:45.328
vertically, an interior of a 
room with a curtained window at 

00:43:45.329 --> 00:43:47.804
righted.  In the foreground at 
right is the 

00:43:51.533 --> 00:43:53.533
silhouette of a black woman.  To
the left and behind her is a 

00:43:56.856 --> 00:43:59.113
younger black female in a bright
white dress, her hair adorned 

00:43:59.114 --> 00:44:01.114
behind her head 

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:05.438
with a white bow.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  One more image, and

00:44:05.439 --> 00:44:10.134
then we'll get deep into what 
these images are, because I 

00:44:10.135 --> 00:44:12.387
think it's fascinating.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, so, he did a 

00:44:12.388 --> 00:44:14.388
lot of 

00:44:15.847 --> 00:44:18.501
allegorical subjects, the 
prodigal son, and this one is 

00:44:18.502 --> 00:44:21.364
part of a series called Orpheus.
I just really liked the, um, the

00:44:25.902 --> 00:44:27.534
composition of this, the way 
it's it's printed, and you'll 

00:44:27.535 --> 00:44:30.401
see in a lot of the images we 
showed, he has a unique way of 

00:44:33.046 --> 00:44:35.677
mounting these images on these  
multi-layered paper supports.  I

00:44:35.678 --> 00:44:38.535
just think they add a lot to the
feeling and the tension 

00:44:38.536 --> 00:44:40.536
surrounding the 

00:44:41.787 --> 00:44:43.422
image, and he was kind of the 
inventor of this style of 

00:44:43.423 --> 00:44:45.423
mounting, which became 

00:44:47.245 --> 00:44:49.245
known as the American style.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Day was part of a 

00:44:51.183 --> 00:44:54.245
photography movement called the 
Photo Successionests,  right?  I

00:44:54.246 --> 00:44:56.246
love this term.

00:45:00.216 --> 00:45:01.639
Apparently, it was chosen mainly
because they felt like it was a 

00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:03.640
very 

00:45:07.813 --> 00:45:09.058
abrasive term, and Alfred, who 
was one of the other founders, 

00:45:09.059 --> 00:45:11.059
had this 

00:45:14.162 --> 00:45:16.600
conversation that I stumbled 
upon in which she said what is 

00:45:16.601 --> 00:45:20.509
photo succession, and am I a 
photo successionests?  And he 

00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:24.832
said, well, do you feel like you
are one?  He said that's all 

00:45:24.833 --> 00:45:25.440
there is to it.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  You were, if he 

00:45:25.441 --> 00:45:30.979
said you  were, and actually, 
Day was part of  pictorialism, 

00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.980
but not so much photo 

00:45:36.279 --> 00:45:38.279
succession, because photo 
secession 

00:45:39.563 --> 00:45:42.016
succession, you needed, they 
actually were not simpatico, so 

00:45:42.017 --> 00:45:46.964
he was never part of the formal 
movement, although his art is 

00:45:46.965 --> 00:45:47.792
really part of that movement.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think what you're

00:45:47.793 --> 00:45:52.912
just describing about the 
objects sits really well with 

00:45:52.913 --> 00:45:54.151
kind of that movement, which was
said that what was significant 

00:45:54.152 --> 00:45:58.422
about a photograph was not what 
was in front of the camera, but 

00:45:58.423 --> 00:46:00.459
the manipulation of the image by
the photographer, and I'm 

00:46:04.939 --> 00:46:06.939
generalizing, but, um, so, talk 
about 

00:46:09.271 --> 00:46:10.701
how these photographs physically
were made, because I think it's 

00:46:10.702 --> 00:46:12.702
different from what we would 
sometimes imagine.

00:46:15.001 --> 00:46:17.001
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, so, with this

00:46:18.478 --> 00:46:21.434
particular era of photography, 
they were really trying to 

00:46:21.435 --> 00:46:23.435
legitimize photography and kind 
of put it on the same level as 

00:46:25.354 --> 00:46:26.797
other types of art, like drawing
and painting, and one of the 

00:46:26.798 --> 00:46:28.798
ways that they 

00:46:30.283 --> 00:46:33.169
did that was through the 
manipulation of the print.  One 

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.170
of the processes that  allowed 
for 

00:46:37.041 --> 00:46:39.480
this really, um, varied 
manipulation was called the 

00:46:39.481 --> 00:46:43.555
platinum process.  So, almost, 
not everything Day ever made, 

00:46:43.556 --> 00:46:45.556
but most everything he ever 

00:46:47.637 --> 00:46:49.477
printed in his career was made 
using the platinum printing 

00:46:49.478 --> 00:46:51.478
process, and platinum 

00:46:52.556 --> 00:46:54.556
is basically a paper support, 
and then 

00:46:56.044 --> 00:46:58.014
the image is actually made with 
platinum metal that's deposited 

00:46:58.015 --> 00:47:00.015
into the fibers 

00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.300
of that paper, and, so, they're 

00:47:04.993 --> 00:47:06.629
extremely stable, if made 
correctly, and they were called 

00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:08.630
the prints of 

00:47:09.921 --> 00:47:11.921
prophecies, because it has this 

00:47:13.197 --> 00:47:15.843
incredible richness and kind of 
what we call dynamic  range, the

00:47:15.844 --> 00:47:17.844
levels between 

00:47:21.362 --> 00:47:23.362
the bright white and the dark 
dark

00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:25.487
.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think there are 

00:47:25.488 --> 00:47:27.488
some  

00:47:28.746 --> 00:47:30.804
artists, and our next guest will
have experience with this, who 

00:47:30.805 --> 00:47:32.805
are meticulous in their 
recording of when a work was 

00:47:34.665 --> 00:47:36.703
made and how it was made and so 
on and so on.  It sounds to me 

00:47:36.704 --> 00:47:39.555
like a lot of your work is 
trying to, like, puzzle together

00:47:42.014 --> 00:47:44.014
the sort of true dates of some 
of these works.

00:47:46.882 --> 00:47:49.552
Maybe some people in the room 
know this, but some do not, but 

00:47:49.553 --> 00:47:51.808
in the basement of the Madison 
Building, 

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:57.050
there's a full, like, forensic 

00:47:58.736 --> 00:48:01.838
laboratory that could totally be
out of a television show.  It's 

00:48:01.839 --> 00:48:04.098
really amazing.  Can you talk 
about, like, the actual 

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:06.989
techniques that you're using to 
try to make some sense of this 

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:09.441
large collection of images?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, so, one of 

00:48:09.442 --> 00:48:13.928
the things I'm using is just 
really systematic looking, like 

00:48:13.929 --> 00:48:16.392
understanding how these 
processes work and really 

00:48:16.393 --> 00:48:18.393
cataloging all 

00:48:19.647 --> 00:48:21.966
of the different variations 
that, um, that an artist could 

00:48:21.967 --> 00:48:23.967
use in making them.

00:48:25.639 --> 00:48:27.886
So, that might include just, 
like I said, cataloging 

00:48:27.887 --> 00:48:30.760
systematically the mouth, but 
also looking at the elemental 

00:48:31.775 --> 00:48:33.775
composition of the image.

00:48:34.835 --> 00:48:36.835
So, really looking at how that 
image 

00:48:37.898 --> 00:48:39.543
was made, and you can't always 
do that with your eye, so one of

00:48:39.544 --> 00:48:41.544
the techniques 

00:48:46.065 --> 00:48:47.483
we use is x-ray florescent, a  
non-disruptive technique, and 

00:48:47.484 --> 00:48:51.602
you point an x-ray beam at the 
image, and it excites the atoms 

00:48:51.603 --> 00:48:56.518
and gives you a spectrum of the 
elements that are in that sheet 

00:48:56.519 --> 00:48:58.519
of paper, and if you take that 
spectra and combine it with a 

00:49:00.810 --> 00:49:02.467
knowledge of the prophecies, you
can really determine what type 

00:49:02.468 --> 00:49:07.581
of technique they were using.  
So, in the first image that we 

00:49:07.582 --> 00:49:09.582
looked 

00:49:11.063 --> 00:49:14.015
up with the Dying Slave of 
Thomas  Harris, it's a platform 

00:49:14.016 --> 00:49:19.126
print, so it contains platinum, 
but it also contains a large bit

00:49:19.127 --> 00:49:21.127
of mercury, so we know it 

00:49:23.857 --> 00:49:25.857
was a mercury platinum print, 
which gives it this brown tone.

00:49:30.606 --> 00:49:33.483
So,ert, artists tended to use 
certain techniques, so you can 

00:49:33.484 --> 00:49:36.770
start to understand how much 
manipulation they're doing when 

00:49:36.771 --> 00:49:40.875
they transfer from one technique
to another, and it can help you 

00:49:40.876 --> 00:49:42.753
date and transfer images to 
them.

00:49:42.754 --> 00:49:44.388
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  One thing I didn't 
bring up with our last guest 

00:49:44.389 --> 00:49:49.604
that I could have brought up was
that the poetry department is 

00:49:49.605 --> 00:49:51.662
sometimes either responsible for
or becomes the conduit 

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.686
to new discoveries of poems that
are  attributed.  I know that 

00:49:56.687 --> 00:49:58.687
fairly recently, there was 

00:50:01.404 --> 00:50:03.675
a new Walt Whitman poem that was
discovered from the manuscripts 

00:50:05.918 --> 00:50:08.791
department, or, sorry, the 
periodicals department, a poem 

00:50:08.792 --> 00:50:11.076
that was labeled WW, and 
somebody thought, well, maybe 

00:50:11.077 --> 00:50:13.077
this 

00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:16.000
could very well be a Whitman.  
Have there been photographs that

00:50:16.001 --> 00:50:18.001
we 

00:50:20.125 --> 00:50:22.125
didn't know there were  
Holendays that we now know are?

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.201
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes, actually.  
There was an interesting case 

00:50:24.202 --> 00:50:27.077
where the curator brought down a
print that 

00:50:30.732 --> 00:50:33.369
had come in through the Clarence
White collection, and Holenday 

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.280
and White were really good 
friends, he was godfather to one

00:50:37.281 --> 00:50:39.281
of their kids, and they had a 
very close working relationship.

00:50:40.124 --> 00:50:42.816
They both did photographs at the
same time, so sometimes, it can 

00:50:42.817 --> 00:50:44.817
be difficult 

00:50:45.874 --> 00:50:47.714
when photographers are working 
kind of with the same subjects 

00:50:47.715 --> 00:50:50.806
and stuff to tell who's making 
what print.  This print came 

00:50:50.807 --> 00:50:54.706
down, it came in through the 
Clarence White collection, but 

00:50:54.707 --> 00:50:56.736
it was unattributed, and through
my work on cataloging all of his

00:50:58.178 --> 00:51:00.178
protoographic mounts and his 
techniques, 

00:51:01.664 --> 00:51:03.300
I was able to link that print to
Day, and then I started really 

00:51:03.301 --> 00:51:08.026
looking at the literature, 
trying to find any references 

00:51:08.027 --> 00:51:10.437
that might, um, be somewhere, 
and I was able to find a print 

00:51:10.438 --> 00:51:14.871
mounted almost in exactly the 
same manner that was published, 

00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:16.872
so it was kind of the 

00:51:17.983 --> 00:51:19.612
cataloging and then looking at 
the historic literature, and we,

00:51:19.613 --> 00:51:21.648
um, we've been able to attribute
quite a few 

00:51:25.135 --> 00:51:27.594
images that were misattributed 
or unattributed to Day now in 

00:51:27.595 --> 00:51:31.286
our collection, I think a total 
of six images that we've been 

00:51:31.287 --> 00:51:37.017
able to clarify the attribution.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Last episode, um, 

00:51:37.018 --> 00:51:39.018
we talked about an experiment 
that somebody in the 

00:51:42.579 --> 00:51:45.233
labs department did, who's 
sitting two rows back, so over 

00:51:45.234 --> 00:51:47.704
here, made a really excellent 
little tool that takes, um, 

00:51:49.158 --> 00:51:51.158
photographs and breaks them down
into 

00:51:52.259 --> 00:51:54.951
small color palates, which you 
can use to, um, read across an 

00:51:54.952 --> 00:51:59.453
archive of photographs.  I can 
imagine one of the challenges 

00:52:02.210 --> 00:52:04.671
is, like, how do you hold more 
than the five images we've seen 

00:52:04.672 --> 00:52:06.672
today in your 

00:52:08.788 --> 00:52:10.835
mind for long enough to 
remember, like, and, so, the 

00:52:10.836 --> 00:52:13.515
conversion of these photographs 
into data, I think greatly 

00:52:14.357 --> 00:52:16.357
assists that process.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Absolutely.

00:52:17.839 --> 00:52:19.268
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And I know that 
that is some of the work that 

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:23.802
you're looking to do, right, is 
the sort of, so, I hate this 

00:52:23.803 --> 00:52:26.249
term, but I'll use it once, the 
kind of big data techniques to 

00:52:26.250 --> 00:52:30.146
analyze the catalog, or the 
collection as a whole.  Can you 

00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:31.785
talk a little about what you're 
doing?

00:52:31.786 --> 00:52:33.811
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.  Just with 
Day or other things too?

00:52:34.840 --> 00:52:36.262
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  In general.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'm just really 

00:52:36.263 --> 00:52:40.979
interested  in, I mean, 
conservators are very good at 

00:52:40.980 --> 00:52:42.980
systematic looking, it's kind 
of, 

00:52:45.123 --> 00:52:46.556
it's part of the job 
description, so, um, but we 

00:52:46.557 --> 00:52:48.557
haven't been so good 

00:52:50.077 --> 00:52:51.513
necessarily at recording that in
a way over time where we could 

00:52:51.514 --> 00:52:53.514
start to really 

00:52:56.015 --> 00:52:58.193
see what that data told us 
beyond what an individual object

00:52:58.194 --> 00:53:02.120
brings to the table, but really 
looking at hundreds of things, 

00:53:02.121 --> 00:53:03.771
and then what does that data 
tell us about things that we may

00:53:03.772 --> 00:53:07.436
never have noticed before.  So, 
you  know, I did that with Day, 

00:53:10.492 --> 00:53:12.761
and it's led to the redating of 
some of the prints, the 

00:53:12.762 --> 00:53:14.762
reattribution of many of the 
prints.

00:53:16.237 --> 00:53:18.502
Right  now, I'm also looking at,
um, Civil War maps, so that's 

00:53:18.503 --> 00:53:21.794
one thing that I'm looking at 
with big data, but I think, 

00:53:21.795 --> 00:53:24.245
actually, the most exciting one 
I'm working on right now is  

00:53:24.246 --> 00:53:27.089
looking in the collections, the 
general collections 

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.050
books, we have 78,000 books that
are on photographic 

00:53:33.051 --> 00:53:35.711
technologies, so, of  course, my
head, like, exploded, because 

00:53:39.828 --> 00:53:42.066
it was so incredible, it's one 
of my favorite places on Earth, 

00:53:42.067 --> 00:53:44.067
and I know 

00:53:46.396 --> 00:53:48.228
that makes me a total  nerd, but
it was, like, so amazing, and 

00:53:48.229 --> 00:53:50.229
then you open 

00:53:52.111 --> 00:53:53.995
these books, and you realize 
there are actually photographs 

00:53:53.996 --> 00:53:56.456
in that books.  When 
conservators can see photographs

00:53:59.245 --> 00:54:01.424
of a known date and then we 
would have the recipes for how 

00:54:01.425 --> 00:54:06.955
they made them, I was like, oh 
my gosh, we should start to mine

00:54:06.956 --> 00:54:08.956
this, and I call it mapping the 

00:54:10.826 --> 00:54:12.826
genome of 19th century 
manufactured photography.

00:54:14.694 --> 00:54:17.330
So, how do we take it beyond 
just one sample and actually 

00:54:17.331 --> 00:54:22.452
start to catalog this data so 
that it can show us new things 

00:54:22.453 --> 00:54:23.674
about photography that was 
manufactured in the 19th 

00:54:23.675 --> 00:54:28.406
century?  So, we've started to 
mine the 1500 samples that we 

00:54:28.407 --> 00:54:31.911
have collected, and we're seeing
things like corporate  takeovers

00:54:31.912 --> 00:54:34.581
and photography that were 
happening in the 1880s, you 

00:54:34.582 --> 00:54:39.085
know, and it's, like, just 
really fascinating things that 

00:54:39.086 --> 00:54:41.086
we never would have understood 
before.

00:54:45.921 --> 00:54:46.118
So, I think it has, it's a dirty
business.

00:54:46.119 --> 00:54:47.763
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That was part of 

00:54:47.764 --> 00:54:51.854
the reason that I wanted to have
this conversation with you 

00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:53.914
today, was to sort of get this 
sense of what these types of 

00:54:53.915 --> 00:54:55.915
techniques 

00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.497
offer as a kind of way into this
largeness of an archive that is 

00:55:02.763 --> 00:55:04.422
otherwise sometimes, I think can
feel really impenetrable.

00:55:04.423 --> 00:55:06.423
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Absolutely.  We 
have, you know, 16 million 

00:55:08.088 --> 00:55:10.164
photographs, so we have a lot of
work to do with mining it.

00:55:12.406 --> 00:55:16.095
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And also, to learn 
more about  Holenday.  I mean, 

00:55:16.096 --> 00:55:18.188
what an amazing individual.  I 
know that, in some ways, Day was

00:55:18.189 --> 00:55:20.189
a human version of this book, 
right?

00:55:23.322 --> 00:55:25.322
Where he was a kind of bridge 
between 

00:55:26.635 --> 00:55:29.508
so many different people in so 
many different times.  He 

00:55:29.509 --> 00:55:31.553
founded  Copeland and Day 
Publishing, which was maybe most

00:55:31.554 --> 00:55:36.060
famous for kind of publishing 
this idea of kind of the small 

00:55:36.061 --> 00:55:38.061
magazine in-American 

00:55:40.771 --> 00:55:42.771
America in America, um, he was 
part of a 

00:55:46.538 --> 00:55:48.385
club which included Bliss Carm 
Carmenand all kinds of people, 

00:55:48.386 --> 00:55:50.386
and then I think my 

00:55:53.913 --> 00:55:55.913
favorite weird connection, so, 
it was, 

00:55:58.016 --> 00:56:00.016
um, he was friends with a social
worker 

00:56:01.525 --> 00:56:03.148
named  Jesse, and one day, he 
wrote Holenday a note, and the 

00:56:03.149 --> 00:56:08.068
note read I wonder if you may 
happen to have an artist friend 

00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:10.069
who would care to be 

00:56:14.154 --> 00:56:16.154
interested in a little Syrian 
boy

00:56:20.352 --> 00:56:22.352
.  This story, it blows me away.

00:56:25.667 --> 00:56:27.076
Is there one piece of  
Holenday's amazing strangeness 

00:56:27.077 --> 00:56:29.077
that you want to leave with us?

00:56:31.649 --> 00:56:33.886
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, I love that 
he, he's fascinating to study 

00:56:33.887 --> 00:56:37.769
because of his meticulous 
nature, which I think comes out 

00:56:37.770 --> 00:56:39.770
of his  publishing days, but 
he's 

00:56:40.822 --> 00:56:42.822
also, he was such a generous 
person, and 

00:56:44.082 --> 00:56:45.317
every letter that you see 
written to him was thank you for

00:56:45.318 --> 00:56:47.968
thinking of  me, thank you for 
sending me this, thank you for 

00:56:51.529 --> 00:56:54.371
giving me my education, 
sponsoring me for this, and, so,

00:56:54.372 --> 00:56:56.372
I think, you know, 

00:56:57.403 --> 00:56:59.871
his work with him being able to 
become the writer that he was 

00:56:59.872 --> 00:57:02.105
was in direct relationship to 
him knowing  Holenday, 

00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:07.466
and, so, it just feels really 
great to study someone who's so 

00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:09.467
fascinating, but 

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.609
also such a wonderful human 
being too.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:13.064
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, speaking of 
generosity, thank you for being 

00:57:13.065 --> 00:57:15.502
so generous with our time.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you so much 

00:57:15.503 --> 00:57:17.503
for having me.
(Applause.

00:57:19.533 --> 00:57:21.533
)

00:57:22.895 --> 00:57:24.895
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  In the 1950s, the 

00:57:26.984 --> 00:57:31.943
mathematician and meteorologist 
was thinking about the weather. 

00:57:31.944 --> 00:57:34.219
He was experimenting with 
statistical forecasting, but he 

00:57:34.220 --> 00:57:36.220
found that his simulations 
didn't match the messy, wet 

00:57:38.723 --> 00:57:40.723
reality of the real world.  
Weather, right?

00:57:44.106 --> 00:57:45.317
So, he setup to develop a 
non-linear model that would 

00:57:45.318 --> 00:57:47.318
match the unpredictability of 
nature.

00:57:51.057 --> 00:57:53.057
In 1963, he published a paper 
called 

00:57:54.364 --> 00:57:56.599
non-periodic  flow -- which laid
down the foundations for an 

00:57:56.600 --> 00:58:00.895
entire branch of mathematics 
called chaos theory.  Chaos 

00:58:00.896 --> 00:58:02.542
systems are interesting in that 
they start off quite 

00:58:02.543 --> 00:58:07.475
predictable.  After a certain 
amount of time though, they 

00:58:07.476 --> 00:58:09.476
start to behave in a way which, 
for 

00:58:11.335 --> 00:58:13.863
a lot of intents and purposes, 
resembles randomness.  This is 

00:58:13.864 --> 00:58:16.315
why weather forecasters can only
predict the weather 10 days out.

00:58:18.185 --> 00:58:20.449
One of the things that defines a
chaotic system is that it's 

00:58:20.450 --> 00:58:23.298
particularly sensitive to 
initial conditions, that is the 

00:58:23.299 --> 00:58:25.997
state of the system when it 
starts has a huge effect on how 

00:58:25.998 --> 00:58:29.865
it will behave long into the 
future.  This idea that these 

00:58:29.866 --> 00:58:31.866
extraordinary, elaborate 
mathematical structures could 

00:58:34.379 --> 00:58:36.459
be so dependent on minute 
changes right at the beginning 

00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:38.460
eventually gave rise to a famous
term that he coined, the 

00:58:40.405 --> 00:58:42.405
butterfly effect.

00:58:44.684 --> 00:58:46.724
His model, particularly the 
Lorens attractor, is a set of 

00:58:46.725 --> 00:58:50.608
three  differential equations.  
There are three constants which 

00:58:50.609 --> 00:58:54.521
define those at delicate initial
conditions that we spoke about. 

00:58:54.522 --> 00:58:56.522
By changing the values of these 

00:58:57.601 --> 00:58:59.601
numbers, the system can now put 
a vast 

00:59:03.227 --> 00:59:05.865
menagerie of strange geometries,
set to a very particular 

00:59:05.866 --> 00:59:07.866
structure, set of 

00:59:10.974 --> 00:59:13.653
values, 28, 10 and 8 over 3, it 
attracts a structure which looks

00:59:13.654 --> 00:59:16.508
an awful lot like a butterfly.  
It's when we watch that 

00:59:16.509 --> 00:59:20.191
butterfly emerge though by 
setting the system free to 

00:59:20.192 --> 00:59:22.855
animate over time that we get a 
real sense of the beauty of the 

00:59:22.856 --> 00:59:26.992
attractor.  We see how it lives 
through long periods of 

00:59:26.993 --> 00:59:28.993
regularity, where we start to 
recognize the pattern, only to  

00:59:32.174 --> 00:59:34.174
seemingly at random switch 
course or change direction.

00:59:36.083 --> 00:59:38.532
Joel, can you tell us what the  
Lorens attractor looks like?

00:59:38.752 --> 00:59:40.752
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Sure.

00:59:44.290 --> 00:59:46.290
This image features swirls of 
lines, 

00:59:48.196 --> 00:59:50.196
or is it one line, that turns 
and curves 

00:59:52.101 --> 00:59:54.101
in two connected parts, each 
comprised 

00:59:55.788 --> 00:59:58.647
of oval shapes, enlarging from a
core into the arched collection 

00:59:58.648 --> 01:00:00.648
of swirls.

01:00:01.699 --> 01:00:03.699
At left, it leans to the left, 
while 

01:00:05.426 --> 01:00:07.426
the right series of ovals leans 
to the right.

01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:16.010
Overall, two angled and menacing
eyes, 

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:19.300
or a stark, colorless butterfly 
on the wing.

01:00:19.945 --> 01:00:23.842
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  My third and last 
guest today is Kathleen O'Neal. 

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:25.983
Hi Kathleen.  Welcome to Artist 
in the Archive.

01:00:26.343 --> 01:00:28.343
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Hi.

01:00:29.638 --> 01:00:32.485
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, Kathleen was 
one of the first people I met at

01:00:32.486 --> 01:00:34.486
the library.

01:00:35.555 --> 01:00:38.038
I went on this grand, um, 
extraordinary tour of all the 

01:00:38.039 --> 01:00:42.137
rooms and as many of the 
collections as I could get to, 

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:43.555
and Kathleen showed us the 
manuscript division, and at the 

01:00:43.556 --> 01:00:48.694
end of the tour, sort of more or
less offhand, she said, and over

01:00:48.695 --> 01:00:50.125
there is the original Lorens 
attractor software.

01:00:50.126 --> 01:00:52.364
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And I, being me, 

01:00:52.365 --> 01:00:54.365
was like 

01:00:56.247 --> 01:00:58.075
oh my gosh, let's go see it, 
and, so, we saw it, but maybe we

01:00:58.076 --> 01:01:02.369
can start by talking a little 
bit about the manuscript 

01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.209
division, what it holds, what 
kinds of things belong in the 

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:06.210
manuscript 

01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:10.718
division, and then we can move 
on to the Lorens collection.

01:01:10.756 --> 01:01:12.596
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The manuscript 
division collects the personal 

01:01:12.597 --> 01:01:14.597
papers and 

01:01:16.157 --> 01:01:17.588
organizational records of, um, 
people and organizations that 

01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:19.589
have cultural 

01:01:21.051 --> 01:01:22.477
significance to the United 
States States, documents, the 

01:01:22.478 --> 01:01:26.808
cultural history, that means the
political arts, science, um, and

01:01:26.809 --> 01:01:28.809
the every day lives of the 

01:01:32.116 --> 01:01:34.116
American people, and we have 
over 11,000 collections.

01:01:36.010 --> 01:01:38.010
Some are small, a single item, 
others, 

01:01:40.322 --> 01:01:43.831
like the NAACP records, is 
millions of items.  We mostly 

01:01:43.832 --> 01:01:45.884
collect manuscripts, but we do 
have some 3D objects, we have 

01:01:50.484 --> 01:01:52.959
photographs, we have scrapbooks.
Um, there's an example of almost

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:57.060
any type of material you could 
find, and now, as we're 

01:01:57.061 --> 01:01:59.122
collecting these, um, more 
modern collections, we're 

01:01:59.123 --> 01:02:03.428
getting more digital materials. 
So, that's our new frontier.

01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:06.108
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  If you look on the 
library's Wikipedia page or 

01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:10.822
anywhere else, they'll give you 
numbers for all of the other 

01:02:10.823 --> 01:02:13.067
departments about how much they 
hold, and then for the 

01:02:13.068 --> 01:02:18.158
manuscripts department, they're 
just like, seriously, lots.  

01:02:18.159 --> 01:02:19.598
That's how much it has.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, they say 70 

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:23.456
million items, but, of course, 
it depends on how you count an 

01:02:23.457 --> 01:02:24.690
item.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Right, and you have

01:02:24.691 --> 01:02:26.691
some 

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:31.005
items on your lap, and we'll 
talk about this in a moment, but

01:02:31.006 --> 01:02:33.006
you helped to process this 
particular collection, right?

01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:36.291
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The Lorens 
collection came 

01:02:39.659 --> 01:02:42.101
to the library in about 2008, 
2009, and it was processed by 

01:02:42.102 --> 01:02:46.846
Joseph brooks.  He processed the
paper, and the paper portion of 

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:48.847
the collection is about 

01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:56.089
15,000 items, it's 44 boxes and 
12 oversize boxes, which is a 

01:02:56.090 --> 01:02:58.090
relatively small collection for 
the 

01:02:59.979 --> 01:03:01.979
manuscript division, but the 
digital 

01:03:04.259 --> 01:03:06.259
materials that came in included 
a CPU, 

01:03:09.002 --> 01:03:11.678
um, an 8-inch floppy, a couple 
of 5 and a  quarter inch 

01:03:11.679 --> 01:03:13.679
floppies, 3 and a 

01:03:15.354 --> 01:03:16.993
quarter inch floppy and some 
optimal disks, and at the time 

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:21.714
they came in, we didn't have the
tools we  needed to process 

01:03:21.715 --> 01:03:22.728
those materials, but in the last
several years, and this is one 

01:03:22.729 --> 01:03:26.655
of the things I love about this 
collection, is that, sometimes, 

01:03:26.656 --> 01:03:28.656
you have these collections that 
draw you out into the 

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.637
library, but you get you get to 
draw on the expertise of other 

01:03:33.638 --> 01:03:35.638
divisions and 

01:03:37.124 --> 01:03:39.124
other people, and the 
preservation has 

01:03:40.632 --> 01:03:43.108
been  developing, um, forensic 
station down in preservation, 

01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:45.109
and Amanda May, 

01:03:46.171 --> 01:03:48.850
who has saved my life more than 
once, um, developed a work flow 

01:03:48.851 --> 01:03:52.996
to recover the 5 and a quarter 
inch floppies.  So, at that 

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:55.250
point, um, which was about a 
year or two ago, we thought we 

01:03:55.251 --> 01:03:57.251
were 

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:04.890
ready to tackle the CPU and the 
5 and a quarter inch floppies.  

01:04:04.891 --> 01:04:06.891
The 8-inch floppy will have to 
wait for another day.

01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:10.181
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We are going to use
some 

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.892
real software from the 1980s and
70s 

01:04:16.625 --> 01:04:19.478
momentarily, but we'll get there
in a minute.  Um, the manuscript

01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:21.928
department, this is not only 
kind of a record of history 

01:04:27.527 --> 01:04:29.527
itself, but I think it also is 
this scaffolding around history.

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:32.958
In this case, we have a 
collection which starts near or 

01:04:32.959 --> 01:04:34.959
before the been 

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.909
good beginning of modern 
computation and 

01:04:42.957 --> 01:04:44.957
that ends very much in the 
modern 

01:04:45.963 --> 01:04:47.147
computational era, and the 
reason why I didn't show you a 

01:04:47.148 --> 01:04:50.032
picture when Joel described the 
Lorens attractor is because this

01:04:50.033 --> 01:04:52.033
is how it 

01:04:53.655 --> 01:04:56.991
existed in Edward Lorens' head 
in the beginning, because the 

01:04:56.992 --> 01:04:59.892
computational power was not 
available to render it.  Can you

01:04:59.893 --> 01:05:02.951
show us the first diagram?  
Yeah, this one.  We'll start 

01:05:02.952 --> 01:05:04.952
with this one.

01:05:06.659 --> 01:05:08.659
And to give a sense of what that

01:05:09.709 --> 01:05:11.709
process would have looked like 
up on 

01:05:14.807 --> 01:05:15.831
stage, and we'll post this 
image, it's a piece of graph 

01:05:15.832 --> 01:05:19.772
paper, right?  It's got marks on
it in pencil, and, so, you can 

01:05:19.773 --> 01:05:21.626
imagine that this grand idea, 
which we'll talk in a second 

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:24.892
about how this came up, because 
I think it's really fascinating,

01:05:24.893 --> 01:05:26.893
would have emerged 

01:05:28.619 --> 01:05:30.619
not as a whole, but as small  
fragments 

01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:33.763
over a course of years and 
decades.

01:05:33.764 --> 01:05:35.193
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, I mean, I 
think the thing that struck me 

01:05:35.194 --> 01:05:37.194
is because, as I 

01:05:38.257 --> 01:05:39.704
processed the digital, I didn't 
ignore the paper, I  needed to 

01:05:39.705 --> 01:05:43.164
look at the paper so I could 
understand the relationship 

01:05:43.165 --> 01:05:45.622
between the two, and a lot of 
times, it was the paper that 

01:05:45.623 --> 01:05:48.491
told me what the born digital 
materials were, 

01:05:52.811 --> 01:05:54.811
but, um, was how handmade 
everything is 

01:05:56.749 --> 01:05:58.749
and the labor of scientific 
work, which, 

01:06:00.850 --> 01:06:02.850
um, is so clear when you see all
these 

01:06:06.596 --> 01:06:08.860
tiny, little dots that needed to
be plotted.  Later, and we  

01:06:08.861 --> 01:06:10.894
talked about this, you know, 
they've just run out of room, 

01:06:10.895 --> 01:06:12.895
the 

01:06:13.977 --> 01:06:15.596
graph paper is not big enough.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  That second image, 

01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.597
because 

01:06:18.695 --> 01:06:20.695
this is a great example of that,
where 

01:06:23.392 --> 01:06:25.022
Lorens begins to plot perhaps 
the first plot of the attractor,

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:27.023
only to realize 

01:06:30.676 --> 01:06:32.676
that he's run out of graph paper
.

01:06:33.805 --> 01:06:35.805
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah

01:06:37.996 --> 01:06:40.041
, that's half of it, and, so, 
there's, um, lots of graph 

01:06:40.042 --> 01:06:42.042
paper, and also, there's 
another, I'll just hold this one

01:06:44.751 --> 01:06:46.802
up, this is sort of an expanded 
version of that, and, so, 

01:06:46.803 --> 01:06:51.127
there's dozens of these, and if 
you were really smart and knew 

01:06:51.128 --> 01:06:52.780
what you were doing, you could 
lay them out on the floor like a

01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:54.781
jigsaw 

01:07:00.051 --> 01:07:02.280
puzzle or a mosaic and put them 
together.  Should I show the --

01:07:02.281 --> 01:07:04.941
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Not yet.  We'll 
save that for the end.

01:07:11.109 --> 01:07:15.178
I'll say what we're looking at 
is kind of an 8.5 by 11 piece of

01:07:15.179 --> 01:07:17.220
graph paper, and on it are 
pencil, but also blue and red 

01:07:17.221 --> 01:07:19.221
ink 

01:07:20.266 --> 01:07:22.266
lines, something that, to my 
mind, 

01:07:23.332 --> 01:07:25.173
represents the kind of, like, 
quarrel inside of a snail shell,

01:07:25.174 --> 01:07:27.174
it's kind of this little piece 
of mathematics, which 

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:32.885
to, um, Lorens, would have been 
real proof of something that, 

01:07:32.886 --> 01:07:37.576
again, more or less, he would 
have had to hold in his mind.  

01:07:37.577 --> 01:07:40.463
The Lorens attractor itself, 
which we'll show in a second, 

01:07:40.464 --> 01:07:42.464
was born of a coincidence, 
right?

01:07:42.701 --> 01:07:43.524
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Can you tell us the

01:07:43.525 --> 01:07:46.587
story?
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Well, the story he 

01:07:46.588 --> 01:07:49.266
tells in his book is he was 
running this series 

01:07:53.395 --> 01:07:55.395
of data, and, um, the data had 
gone out 

01:07:56.445 --> 01:07:58.498
to, um, six decimal points, and 
because he wanted the numbers to

01:07:58.499 --> 01:08:00.499
line up and not kick down to the
next line on the 

01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:05.395
printout, he rounded them to 
three 

01:08:07.496 --> 01:08:09.496
decimal points, and, so, um, I 
should  

01:08:10.566 --> 01:08:12.460
say, this computer took up half 
of his office, it was incredibly

01:08:12.461 --> 01:08:17.022
noisy, just the computer, not 
even the printer, and the 

01:08:17.023 --> 01:08:19.023
printer was one of those, if any
of 

01:08:21.332 --> 01:08:23.332
you remember, and I do, the old 
printers 

01:08:24.965 --> 01:08:27.228
with the sprockets, that you had
to pull the, what is the word?

01:08:28.892 --> 01:08:31.742
(Off mic.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you.  Um, off

01:08:31.743 --> 01:08:35.450
when you were done, that was 
incredibly loud.  So, he goes 

01:08:35.451 --> 01:08:37.451
and gets a cup of coffee 

01:08:38.531 --> 01:08:40.531
and comes back, and he realizes 
he wants 

01:08:42.427 --> 01:08:44.246
to run another set of data, and 
instead of inputting the 

01:08:44.247 --> 01:08:46.247
original numbers, he 

01:08:47.927 --> 01:08:49.367
input the rounded numbers, and 
he goes and gets another cup of 

01:08:49.368 --> 01:08:51.368
coffee, and he 

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080
comes back, and he is surprised 
by what 

01:08:58.003 --> 01:08:59.839
he  sees, because initially, the
data tracked exactly with the 

01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.840
first plotting 

01:09:03.312 --> 01:09:05.312
of the data, but as, I think he 
said it 

01:09:06.762 --> 01:09:08.595
takes about an hour or 
something, as the timeline goes 

01:09:08.596 --> 01:09:10.596
on, the data starts converging, 
and it's not behaving in the 

01:09:14.301 --> 01:09:16.301
way he expected it to.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:20.787
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This story is 
mindbowing mind-blowing to me.

01:09:25.143 --> 01:09:27.991
So, the chaos theory was a slow 
burn.  This paper was only cited

01:09:27.992 --> 01:09:31.670
10 times in the following decade
by people outside of his 

01:09:31.671 --> 01:09:33.671
particular field, so it was not 

01:09:35.137 --> 01:09:37.396
an immediate success, but to put
it in a framing which I think it

01:09:37.397 --> 01:09:39.397
deserves, it is said that when 
we look back on the 20th 

01:09:41.258 --> 01:09:43.896
century, we will see three great
advances in math and physics, 

01:09:43.897 --> 01:09:45.897
those 

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:49.591
being relativity, quantum 
mechanics, and chaos.

01:09:52.285 --> 01:09:53.937
So, this thing that came out of 
a trip to get a cup of coffee 

01:09:53.938 --> 01:09:55.988
and a rounding error became 
something really amazing.

01:09:57.024 --> 01:09:58.850
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I just want to say,
one thing I noticed, I was 

01:09:58.851 --> 01:10:03.355
looking through a new folder the
other day in preparation for 

01:10:03.356 --> 01:10:05.188
today, and much of the 
correspondence is people writing

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:10.071
to Lorens, saying can I get a 
copy of your paper, it's out of 

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:12.072
print.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.

01:10:12.350 --> 01:10:14.350
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, and he credits 
another 

01:10:16.041 --> 01:10:18.041
scientist for handing out copies
of his 

01:10:19.323 --> 01:10:21.323
papers to people for the spread 
of the 

01:10:22.793 --> 01:10:24.428
idea and its application in 
economics and physiology and 

01:10:24.429 --> 01:10:25.668
other areas.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Everywhere.

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:27.485
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  And actually, so, 

01:10:27.486 --> 01:10:31.958
we're going to show some 
software here, and I think in 

01:10:31.959 --> 01:10:32.780
almost all cases, the software 
we're showing you is written by 

01:10:32.781 --> 01:10:36.433
people who were interested in 
the applications of chaos theory

01:10:36.434 --> 01:10:38.434
in other fields.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yes.

01:10:39.485 --> 01:10:42.157
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, this first one 
that I think we'll show is this,

01:10:42.158 --> 01:10:44.158
um, this 

01:10:47.609 --> 01:10:49.982
software by Jackson at the 
Center for , and I'll, um, I'll 

01:10:49.983 --> 01:10:54.274
show you a little bit about how 
this works, and then we can, um,

01:10:54.275 --> 01:10:56.275
talk a little bit.

01:11:02.281 --> 01:11:05.358
I'm going to ask for, um, an 
entrainment goal.  This is so 

01:11:05.359 --> 01:11:07.359
exciting, isn't it?
(Laughing.

01:11:09.816 --> 01:11:11.816
)

01:11:14.426 --> 01:11:17.905
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The initial 
conditions are really going to 

01:11:17.906 --> 01:11:19.906
change the way this 

01:11:21.362 --> 01:11:23.018
runs, but you've been holding 
the Lorens attractor in your 

01:11:23.019 --> 01:11:25.455
head, and now we get to see in 
it.  Do you remember what year 

01:11:25.456 --> 01:11:29.318
this software was --
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, you know what? 

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.747
I have it on a piece of paper 
over there.  I don't remember 

01:11:30.748 --> 01:11:35.050
off the top of my head, but I 
can tell you later.

01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:39.316
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, the yellow line
is the 

01:11:40.577 --> 01:11:42.577
one that's going to render this 
sort of  

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:46.428
classic, um, Lorens attractor 
forum, and you'll notice that 

01:11:46.429 --> 01:11:49.893
what it does is kind of similar 
to what I was describing before,

01:11:49.894 --> 01:11:51.111
where it follows these kind of 
periods where you think you know

01:11:51.112 --> 01:11:56.047
what it's going to do next, and 
then it does something that you 

01:11:56.048 --> 01:11:58.097
don't know it will do next, and 
I think there's an important 

01:11:59.721 --> 01:12:03.197
delineation to be made here 
between randomness and chaos.  

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:05.227
The system is not random, but 
it's chaotic, which I think is a

01:12:05.228 --> 01:12:07.228
really interesting division to 
make, right?

01:12:09.724 --> 01:12:11.967
If it were random, this computer
couldn't simulate it, but 

01:12:11.968 --> 01:12:16.872
because it has these kind of 
three equations driving it, it 

01:12:16.873 --> 01:12:18.873
does continue, um, you know, we 

01:12:20.998 --> 01:12:23.637
can run this essentially 
forever, getting, eventually, 

01:12:23.638 --> 01:12:25.882
this really beautiful butterfly 
form that we're used to.

01:12:27.137 --> 01:12:29.401
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I'm not going to 
speak to the mathematics of it, 

01:12:29.402 --> 01:12:31.402
but I, my, you know, my 
understanding of it is there 

01:12:33.681 --> 01:12:35.681
wouldn't be a butterfly if it 
was truly 

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:39.145
chaotic, because it wouldn't, 
the image 

01:12:41.031 --> 01:12:43.031
wouldn't recreate every time, 
you would 

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:48.800
have a different image.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, there is 

01:12:48.801 --> 01:12:50.801
another piece of software, I 
don't have the name of this.

01:12:53.515 --> 01:12:55.515
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  This is, um, 
actually by 

01:12:59.697 --> 01:13:01.743
Mike  Page and Jim -- who 
created it for -- I hope I 

01:13:01.744 --> 01:13:03.766
pronounced his name correctly.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, I have this one

01:13:03.767 --> 01:13:08.325
all cued up, and I hope that the
sound is going to work here.  

01:13:08.326 --> 01:13:10.326
Otherwise, I'm going to do some 
really 

01:13:11.810 --> 01:13:13.855
good, like, 1980s computer 
sounds for you all, because 

01:13:13.856 --> 01:13:16.303
that's the kind of, um, thing 
that we're looking for here.

01:13:40.713 --> 01:13:42.969
We're going to do the 
experiment, we're going to get 

01:13:42.970 --> 01:13:44.970
some data, so I'm 

01:13:48.407 --> 01:13:50.407
going to load this data file

01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:57.410
.  We'll load that data, and 
now, I'm 

01:14:00.489 --> 01:14:05.876
going to go plot that data.  I 
think we're ready.  Are you 

01:14:05.877 --> 01:14:07.877
ready for it?

01:14:18.142 --> 01:14:21.405
(Beeping.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  I think it's easy 

01:14:21.406 --> 01:14:25.888
for some of us to laugh when we 
look at this software, but I 

01:14:25.889 --> 01:14:31.003
think it's important to realize,
with this one and for the one we

01:14:31.004 --> 01:14:33.454
saw last, for these 
mathematicians and scientists, 

01:14:33.455 --> 01:14:34.892
this is, in many cases, the 
first time they were seeing this

01:14:34.893 --> 01:14:36.893
thing.

01:14:37.984 --> 01:14:39.202
It was this first confirmation 
of something that I think they 

01:14:39.203 --> 01:14:43.875
must have felt was something 
amazing, and to see it, or to 

01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:45.876
hear  it, it must have been a 
revolution.

01:14:45.908 --> 01:14:47.908
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  There's only a few 
letters 

01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:51.657
that are associated with the 
software in this collection, but

01:14:51.658 --> 01:14:55.940
the letters that are, you get 
the sense, like, this is your 

01:14:55.941 --> 01:14:58.175
data, you know, they're writing 
to him, I created this to show 

01:14:58.176 --> 01:15:00.176
your data, 

01:15:02.654 --> 01:15:05.096
and, um, Lorens also said, um, 
at one point that, you know, 

01:15:05.097 --> 01:15:07.097
it's the ability 

01:15:08.785 --> 01:15:10.830
to do, um, change the variables,
it's not the initial computation

01:15:10.831 --> 01:15:14.537
that's so difficult, he said, 
you know, people did these kind 

01:15:14.538 --> 01:15:16.978
of computations way back to the 
Greeks, it's the need to do 

01:15:16.979 --> 01:15:20.849
multiple variations on it.  He 
said I probably would have given

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.850
up 

01:15:25.702 --> 01:15:29.034
without a computer.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  The earliest 

01:15:29.035 --> 01:15:31.689
software that we have, we 
couldn't get running.

01:15:35.544 --> 01:15:37.395
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Yeah, that's 1986.
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  He said micro 

01:15:37.396 --> 01:15:40.296
computers permit the researcher 
to create a much more flexible 

01:15:40.297 --> 01:15:42.352
environment than is generally 
possible with large computers.

01:15:45.625 --> 01:15:46.848
So, here, I think a big benefit 
to see what was happening here 

01:15:46.849 --> 01:15:50.521
compared to, like, that old room
size computer that you were 

01:15:50.522 --> 01:15:52.177
talking to was there was the 
flexibility to kind of see these

01:15:52.178 --> 01:15:54.178
things 

01:15:55.449 --> 01:15:58.142
over and over and over again, 
and, actually, I was talking to 

01:15:58.143 --> 01:16:00.143
one of our 

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.309
previous guests who reminded me,
he is a topologist and a 

01:16:03.310 --> 01:16:05.566
mathematician, that it's 
important that we don't talk 

01:16:05.567 --> 01:16:09.858
about Lorens discovering this 
thing, because it already was 

01:16:09.859 --> 01:16:11.859
there, right?

01:16:21.728 --> 01:16:24.596
Well, let's show one more thing,
because it's the best, and 

01:16:24.597 --> 01:16:27.843
sometimes, I think by looking at
the materials, you get some 

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:32.108
sense of the person.  We heard 
this from our last guest.  We 

01:16:32.109 --> 01:16:35.611
can look at those photographs 
and get some sense of a person. 

01:16:35.612 --> 01:16:37.612
That can sometimes be harder to 
get 

01:16:39.671 --> 01:16:41.908
from computational diagrams and 
from plots on graph paper, but 

01:16:41.909 --> 01:16:46.616
we have something really 
delightful that was part of the 

01:16:46.617 --> 01:16:48.617
Lorens collection.

01:16:49.661 --> 01:16:51.661
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Um, and I'm going 
to show 

01:16:53.504 --> 01:16:55.734
the scientific version of it 
first.  This is, um, I'm not 

01:16:55.735 --> 01:16:58.213
sure whether this is the 
butterfly   turns in a different

01:17:01.055 --> 01:17:01.250
angle or whether there's 
different variables happening 

01:17:01.251 --> 01:17:03.251
here, but it 

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.537
clearly, to me, looks like a 
heart, and 

01:17:07.618 --> 01:17:09.618
again, this is one of the 
delightful 

01:17:11.063 --> 01:17:13.063
things about the handmade 
element of 

01:17:14.723 --> 01:17:16.773
this collection, is, um, there's
the, a computer-generated 

01:17:16.774 --> 01:17:18.774
version of  it, and 

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:21.659
then down here, I was like, why 
is it printed on the right side 

01:17:21.660 --> 01:17:25.525
of the paper?  Well, on the 
bottom, it says I'm strangely 

01:17:25.526 --> 01:17:27.526
attracted to you.
(Laughing.)

01:17:27.764 --> 01:17:29.197
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  So, he was making a
valentine valentine.

01:17:29.198 --> 01:17:32.884
(Laughing.)
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Or sending a 

01:17:32.885 --> 01:17:34.885
message of 

01:17:36.771 --> 01:17:38.087
love, perhaps to his his wife, 
we don't know, but it  makes you

01:17:38.088 --> 01:17:40.088
wonder, and that's what I love 
about it.

01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:43.778
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  Thank you, 
Kathleen.

01:17:41.578 --> 01:17:43.578
(Applause.

01:17:44.597 --> 01:17:46.597
)

01:18:05.301 --> 01:18:07.301
(Singing.

01:18:09.142 --> 01:18:11.142
)

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:16.213
&gt;&gt; SPEAKER:  We're taught in 
high school that math exists 

01:18:16.214 --> 01:18:19.481
inside of cartesian coordinates.
The fact is that math doesn't 

01:18:19.482 --> 01:18:22.780
care about or for our made-up 
axes.  Indeed, we can setup a 

01:18:22.781 --> 01:18:27.311
Lorens attractor inside any 
space we can imagine, real world

01:18:27.312 --> 01:18:32.024
space or  computational space or
emotional space or flavor space 

01:18:32.025 --> 01:18:36.323
or whatever we want.  I wanted 
you to imagine for a moment that

01:18:36.324 --> 01:18:37.769
the room you're in or the bus or
the subway car is filled with 

01:18:37.770 --> 01:18:41.444
words.  Every word in the 
English language, floating in 

01:18:41.445 --> 01:18:43.445
space.

01:18:44.712 --> 01:18:46.712
Over there by the door is a 
cluster of 

01:18:48.988 --> 01:18:50.819
fruit words, pear and apple and 
orange.  Right under your chair 

01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:53.698
are all of the synonyms for 
love.  Above your head are hope 

01:18:53.699 --> 01:18:57.006
and dreams and imagination.  
Proper nouns are here as well in

01:18:57.007 --> 01:19:02.346
dense clusters.  The presidents 
are over near the window.  Just 

01:19:02.347 --> 01:19:04.347
beside them are all the 
countries 

01:19:08.305 --> 01:19:10.754
and states and providences and 
cities.  If you look back at 

01:19:10.755 --> 01:19:14.638
that cluster of fruits by the 
door, you'll see that the apple 

01:19:14.639 --> 01:19:16.887
has been pulled closer to New 
York, drawn to it by so many pop

01:19:18.713 --> 01:19:20.713
cultural references.  As an 
experiment, I thought I'd build 

01:19:22.915 --> 01:19:24.152
the attractor in this word space
and see if the path of the 

01:19:24.153 --> 01:19:26.791
butterfly could be used to 
generate a series of words that 

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:32.099
might resemble some sort of 
geometric poetry, so I used a 

01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:34.100
corpus of 3 million English 
language words and their 

01:19:35.963 --> 01:19:36.578
relationships to create this 
three-dimensional map of 

01:19:36.579 --> 01:19:38.579
language.  I let the attractor 
do its thing 

01:19:41.668 --> 01:19:44.103
inside of this gigantic word 
cloud and recorded the results. 

01:19:44.104 --> 01:19:45.964
Now, remember, these attractors 
are very sensitive to initial 

01:19:45.965 --> 01:19:48.634
conditions, so making small 
changes really affects the 

01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.086
sculpture of their attractor and
thus the kind of so-called poem 

01:19:52.087 --> 01:19:54.087
that they output.

01:20:05.242 --> 01:20:07.242
So, um, here is word space, and,
um, 

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:09.728
word space is a 
three-dimensional object, so, 

01:20:09.729 --> 01:20:12.181
um, on the screen in front of 
me, there's a cloud of points, 

01:20:12.182 --> 01:20:14.182
each 

01:20:16.961 --> 01:20:18.790
representing a word, and these 
words are clustered as in the 

01:20:18.791 --> 01:20:20.825
example I described, so certain 
related words will be in one 

01:20:24.086 --> 01:20:26.086
place, so I can, um, jump over 
maybe to 

01:20:28.194 --> 01:20:30.425
a series of words that are 
somewhat related, there's 

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.667
balancing and coordinate next to
each other, and I'll 

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:38.960
jump over, um, to, um, some 
proper nouns 

01:20:42.342 --> 01:20:44.342
like we described, and then, 
finally, 

01:20:45.404 --> 01:20:47.404
I'll jump over, um, to this 
little 

01:20:48.454 --> 01:20:52.377
narrow tinderal of years, which 
are so often found next to each 

01:20:52.378 --> 01:20:54.408
other in our text.  So, what 
happens if we let the Lorens 

01:20:58.266 --> 01:21:00.266
attractor loosen loose in the 
space?

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:03.599
Well, we see our now familiar 
butterfly shape appear, and we 

01:21:03.600 --> 01:21:05.600
can ask 

01:21:07.961 --> 01:21:09.961
for that butterfly to give us 
some poems.

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:13.013
Now, with Robert in the room, I 
want to be careful, that these 

01:21:13.014 --> 01:21:15.014
are not, in 

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:16.734
fact, poems, but they are 
structures of words which help 

01:21:16.735 --> 01:21:18.735
us maybe explore this 

01:21:19.802 --> 01:21:21.802
vast and confusing space of 
language.

01:21:22.852 --> 01:21:24.680
Now, this particular poem, I'm 
not going to take a chance to 

01:21:24.681 --> 01:21:26.681
read, but I 

01:21:28.977 --> 01:21:30.977
will, um, read to you a few of 
the 

01:21:33.718 --> 01:21:35.718
outputs that came out of this 
software, 

01:21:37.816 --> 01:21:39.816
if I can find my notes amongst 
this 

01:21:42.659 --> 01:21:44.659
gigantic pile of things

01:21:45.756 --> 01:21:47.756

01:21:49.318 --> 01:21:51.318

01:23:29.165 --> 01:23:32.629
announcements competitive.  
Warring statements.  Now, I 

01:23:32.630 --> 01:23:34.630
should mention a little bit 

01:23:35.695 --> 01:23:37.695
about how this is constructed, 
because 

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.050
it's not, in fact, an exact 
random block throughLorens 

01:23:43.051 --> 01:23:45.096
space.  Well, it is, but those 
words are then 

01:23:49.390 --> 01:23:51.441
sent to a  poetic structure.  
Robert, can you guess the 

01:23:51.442 --> 01:23:55.549
structure?  Walt Whitman was the
structure of that poem, which I 

01:23:55.550 --> 01:23:57.550
thought conducted itself 

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:01.437
nicely to the kind of weird 
randomness of it, and again, I 

01:24:01.438 --> 01:24:06.797
don't feel that these things are
themselves poets, but the way of

01:24:06.798 --> 01:24:09.242
using the spirit of Whitman to 
explore this linguistic space in

01:24:09.243 --> 01:24:13.937
a way which we might find to be 
interesting or intriguing.

01:24:17.415 --> 01:24:20.297
Now, as I  mentioned, Kathleen 
showed me the Lorens attractor 

01:24:20.298 --> 01:24:22.736
on the first day of my 
residency, and since then, it's 

01:24:25.006 --> 01:24:27.043
been in the front of my mind.  
As I'm approaching the end of my

01:24:27.044 --> 01:24:30.912
time here, I hope that my own 
creative path will have a lot in

01:24:30.913 --> 01:24:33.155
common with the strange 
attractor.  It may have started 

01:24:33.156 --> 01:24:37.072
in predictable space, following 
an expecting pattern, but now is

01:24:37.073 --> 01:24:39.073
the time, I hope, that it veers 
wildly into chaos.

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.342
Now, push all those words out of
the 

01:24:45.467 --> 01:24:48.317
room, sweep them down the drain,
push them out of the windows.  

01:24:48.318 --> 01:24:49.950
Let's instead fill the room with
everything the library holds, 

01:24:49.951 --> 01:24:53.941
all the maps and manuscripts and
objects and interviews and, of 

01:24:53.942 --> 01:24:55.976
course, books.  So many books.

01:24:59.971 --> 01:25:02.512
Let's put all the tweets in 
there too and the websites.  

01:25:02.513 --> 01:25:04.961
Like our words, these library 
things are now organized by 

01:25:04.962 --> 01:25:07.631
their relationships, that big, 
messy ball in the center is the 

01:25:07.632 --> 01:25:09.632
Civil War.

01:25:12.736 --> 01:25:15.934
Holenday is, we can all agree, 
off in the corner somewhere.  

01:25:15.935 --> 01:25:18.433
I've been thinking a lot about 
how we as humans  navigate this 

01:25:18.434 --> 01:25:20.434
space, through 

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.440
the website or  in-person, in 
one of the library's reading  

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:24.440
rooms.

01:25:25.904 --> 01:25:28.411
We  If we plotted one course, it
would almost always show up as 

01:25:28.412 --> 01:25:30.412
one little 

01:25:31.925 --> 01:25:34.797
point, a densely tangled knot 
occupying one space in this vast

01:25:34.798 --> 01:25:39.432
galaxy, and that's because we 
come to the library with 

01:25:39.433 --> 01:25:40.628
something to find, we come to 
the library with something to 

01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:43.693
seek.  Our paths are nothing 
like those elegant sweeps of the

01:25:43.694 --> 01:25:48.197
Lorens attractor.  Now, I was 
born in 1975, I got my first 

01:25:48.198 --> 01:25:50.639
computer when I was 9.  When I 
went to university in 1993, I 

01:25:53.118 --> 01:25:54.524
taught Internet classes in the 
library.  There were two words 

01:25:54.525 --> 01:25:56.525
that I would use 

01:25:58.622 --> 01:26:00.046
a lot back then, 25 years ago, 
that are rarely ever used at all

01:26:00.047 --> 01:26:07.401
when we talk about the Internet.
Those words are hyper and surf. 

01:26:07.402 --> 01:26:09.169
The term hyper comes from 
mathematics, it refers to an 

01:26:09.170 --> 01:26:11.631
extension, a generalization, a 
kind of radical opening.

01:26:14.905 --> 01:26:16.954
The word surf comes, well, from 
surfing.  To surf the web was to

01:26:16.955 --> 01:26:21.840
be carried off by a force of 
curiosity, not quite sure where 

01:26:21.841 --> 01:26:23.841
you're headed.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.518
So far in my residency, I've 
made abstract maps and strange 

01:26:28.519 --> 01:26:31.806
clocks and wide color palates.  
I've put together artist's names

01:26:31.807 --> 01:26:33.807
and strange lists for cocktail 
parties and 

01:26:37.964 --> 01:26:39.964
I've turned the Lorens attractor
into a 

01:26:40.973 --> 01:26:42.973
vehicle

01:26:44.943 --> 01:26:46.790
, to bring hyper back, to bring 
surfing back, to find non-linear

01:26:46.791 --> 01:26:48.791
waves through this building and 
amongst all the 

01:26:52.741 --> 01:26:54.741
wonderful things that it holds, 
all 

01:26:55.995 --> 01:26:57.418
these strange paths untrodden.

01:26:57.419 --> 01:26:59.419

Copy of German invasion plan

01:27:06.777 --> 01:27:09.636
Captain Candy shortly after the 
great allied bombing of October 

01:27:09.637 --> 01:27:12.277
1944, which marked the last 
phase of German retreat 

01:27:15.496 --> 01:27:20.005
from Greece.  One map, color, on

someone you may have heard of, 
Dr. Carla Hayden, the  librarian

01:34:48.872 --> 01:34:53.177

your friends, and thank you so
