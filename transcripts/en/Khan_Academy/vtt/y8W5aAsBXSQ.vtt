00:00:00.345 --> 00:00:01.829
- [Instructor] So we've
talked at some length

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.534
about the Ideal Gas
Law, where if we assume

00:00:04.534 --> 00:00:06.969
that if a gas in a container is behaving

00:00:06.969 --> 00:00:09.902
like an ideal gas, and
the key assumptions there

00:00:09.902 --> 00:00:11.611
are that there's no forces

00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:13.633
between the actual gas molecules

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:16.637
and that the volume of the
gas molecules is negligible,

00:00:16.637 --> 00:00:17.891
especially when we think about it

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:20.355
relative to the container,
well in that case

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:22.328
we can assume we're dealing
with something that's

00:00:22.328 --> 00:00:25.193
kind of ideal, and we could
apply the Ideal Gas Law,

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.607
that the pressure times the volume

00:00:26.607 --> 00:00:28.342
is going to be equal
to the number of moles

00:00:28.342 --> 00:00:31.662
times ideal gas law,
times ideal gas constant,

00:00:31.662 --> 00:00:34.664
times temperature measured in Kelvin.

00:00:34.664 --> 00:00:37.216
But we've also talked
about in other videos

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:40.456
is that well, real
gases don't behave that,

00:00:40.456 --> 00:00:44.522
and especially as they approach
their condensation point,

00:00:44.522 --> 00:00:47.031
real gases aren't always, you can't always

00:00:47.031 --> 00:00:49.372
make these assumptions about them.

00:00:49.372 --> 00:00:51.311
And so what we're going to
explore in this video is

00:00:51.311 --> 00:00:54.796
how we might be able to
adapt the Ideal Gas Law.

00:00:54.796 --> 00:00:57.484
So, it's a better
description of what happens

00:00:57.484 --> 00:00:59.916
with real gases, and in particular,

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:02.895
we are going to explore
the Van der Waals equation,

00:01:02.895 --> 00:01:04.683
named for Van der Waals, same guy

00:01:04.683 --> 00:01:07.130
who came up with the idea
of Van der Waals forces,

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.165
one of those attractive
forces that make it hard

00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:13.210
or make real gases start to defy

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.222
assumption number one a little bit,

00:01:15.222 --> 00:01:17.621
and what Van der Waals
went about doing is,

00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:19.527
saying well let me see if I can modify

00:01:19.527 --> 00:01:23.259
this P part right over
here, and this V part,

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.839
so it better describes real gases.

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:28.335
And to understand the logic
of the Van der Waals equation,

00:01:28.335 --> 00:01:29.953
which we're going to see in a second,

00:01:29.953 --> 00:01:33.755
let's think about how we
might want to modify P,

00:01:33.755 --> 00:01:36.870
and then we'll think about
how we'll want to modify V.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.517
So let's give ourselves a container.

00:01:40.517 --> 00:01:44.910
Let's put some gas
molecules in that container.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.910
So I've got some gas molecules here.

00:01:48.818 --> 00:01:51.629
And remember, pressure
is force per unit area,

00:01:51.629 --> 00:01:54.196
and the pressure here is
gonna come from the collisions

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:56.539
between the gas, the collisions

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:57.980
from the gas molecules bouncing off

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.704
of the walls of the container.

00:01:59.704 --> 00:02:01.293
Every time they do that, they're gonna

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:04.562
exert a little bit of force on that area.

00:02:04.562 --> 00:02:07.258
And so, you know, that's why
the more temperature you have,

00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:08.813
these things are gonna move around faster,

00:02:08.813 --> 00:02:10.392
you're gonna have more
frequent collisions,

00:02:10.392 --> 00:02:13.303
the more molecules you
have, you're gonna have

00:02:13.303 --> 00:02:15.259
more things to bounce around,
and so those are things

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:17.128
that if you have more of you're
gonna increase the pressure,

00:02:17.128 --> 00:02:19.525
especially if you're holding
your volume constant.

00:02:19.525 --> 00:02:21.755
Now this is assuming an ideal gas,

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:23.713
but let's think about
how things would change

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:25.977
if we had a real gas, where you do have,

00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:27.604
let's say attractive forces between them.

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.810
Let's say they're Van der Waals forces.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.398
So if you have attractive forces between

00:02:31.398 --> 00:02:33.358
the actual gas molecules,
we will also assume

00:02:33.358 --> 00:02:35.711
that the molecules are
not attracted to the walls

00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:37.241
of the container, which
isn't always the case.

00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.074
Sometimes they're more attracted

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:39.059
to the walls of the container.

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.471
But let's assume that
they're not attracted

00:02:40.471 --> 00:02:41.900
to the walls of the container.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.563
Well, the molecules of the middle,

00:02:43.563 --> 00:02:45.636
they're gonna be attracting,
we're gonna assume

00:02:45.636 --> 00:02:49.694
that they're uniformly
distributed about the volume.

00:02:49.694 --> 00:02:51.204
The ones in the middle,
they're gonna be pulled

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:53.043
in every direction, and so
there's not gonna be really

00:02:53.043 --> 00:02:55.977
a significant net force,
but the ones near the side

00:02:55.977 --> 00:02:58.223
of the container, so let's say

00:02:58.223 --> 00:03:00.494
a molecule right over here,

00:03:00.494 --> 00:03:04.527
well, that's gonna have
most of its fellow molecules

00:03:04.527 --> 00:03:06.898
are going to, in this
case, be to its left,

00:03:06.898 --> 00:03:09.027
and so those are the ones that
it's gonna be attracted to,

00:03:09.027 --> 00:03:11.505
so in this, and there's not
gonna be too many or any

00:03:11.505 --> 00:03:13.495
in this case, to the right of it,

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:16.355
and so it's going to have a net inward,

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:18.295
a net inward force.

00:03:18.295 --> 00:03:21.431
Similarly this one up here
will have a net inward force.

00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:23.694
This one right over here
would have a net inward force,

00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:25.210
and the closer we get to the center,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.478
it's gonna start diminishing a little bit,

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:30.125
but as you can see, because
of this attractive force,

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:32.437
these things are more
likely to maybe gravitate

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:34.082
a little bit more towards the center

00:03:34.082 --> 00:03:35.904
than to ricochet off the side.

00:03:35.904 --> 00:03:37.722
They still will ricochet off the side,

00:03:37.722 --> 00:03:39.951
these things are buzzing
around, super chaotics,

00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:41.528
you know, everywhere bouncing,

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:43.349
but if there's some
small, attractive force,

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.984
it might be a little bit more likely

00:03:44.984 --> 00:03:47.833
to move towards the center than to

00:03:47.833 --> 00:03:50.646
bounce off the walls of the container.

00:03:50.646 --> 00:03:52.804
And so as we talked about
in a previous video,

00:03:52.804 --> 00:03:55.206
it's reasonable that if you
hold everything constant,

00:03:55.206 --> 00:03:58.172
that the real pressure, the pressure real

00:03:58.172 --> 00:04:02.477
is going to be less
than the ideal pressure

00:04:02.477 --> 00:04:05.207
because of, in this case,
this attractive force.

00:04:05.207 --> 00:04:06.547
But, Van der Waals, said,

00:04:06.547 --> 00:04:08.500
well can I quantify this difference.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.131
Well, what if we say the real pressure,

00:04:11.131 --> 00:04:12.811
we know it's gonna be less
than the ideal pressure

00:04:12.811 --> 00:04:14.599
because of the attractive forces.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.264
The real pressure is going to be

00:04:16.264 --> 00:04:18.969
equal to the ideal pressure, minus,

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:21.436
and we try to figure out some expression

00:04:21.436 --> 00:04:25.164
that helps us take into
account these net forces,

00:04:25.164 --> 00:04:27.766
especially from things that
are closer to the boundaries.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.621
Well, for every gas
it's gonna be different,

00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:31.684
depending on how they
interact with each other,

00:04:31.684 --> 00:04:34.216
so let's just put a
little constant in there

00:04:34.216 --> 00:04:37.261
and say, alright, well for
any one of these molecules,

00:04:37.261 --> 00:04:41.140
the net inward force is
gonna be proportional to just

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.569
how many molecules it
has in the container.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:45.061
So, especially the density.

00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:47.563
So it's going to be, and the density

00:04:47.563 --> 00:04:50.106
is a number of moles
divided by the volume,

00:04:50.106 --> 00:04:52.513
and that would be for any
one of these molecules,

00:04:52.513 --> 00:04:54.364
but obviously we have many molecules

00:04:54.364 --> 00:04:56.955
and the number of molecules
is also going to be related

00:04:56.955 --> 00:04:59.800
to the density, so you'd want to multiply

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.455
times the density again.

00:05:01.455 --> 00:05:02.642
So you could view this as, okay,

00:05:02.642 --> 00:05:05.025
we're kind of taking it into consideration

00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:07.850
any one molecule, but then
we have a bunch of molecules

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.274
that are all gonna have a
little bit of an inward force

00:05:10.274 --> 00:05:11.832
to different degrees, and we have this

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:14.784
proportionality factor that
helps us take into consideration

00:05:14.784 --> 00:05:18.426
the type of gas that we
might be dealing with.

00:05:18.426 --> 00:05:22.918
And so, you have this notion
that the real pressure

00:05:22.918 --> 00:05:26.183
could be equal to the
ideal pressure minus a

00:05:26.183 --> 00:05:28.100
times n over V squared.

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.171
All, we can algebraically manipulate this,

00:05:32.171 --> 00:05:36.019
add this to both sides of the equation,

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:39.269
and we could get that the real pressure

00:05:40.263 --> 00:05:41.096
plus a

00:05:42.498 --> 00:05:43.498
times n over

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:45.503
V squared

00:05:46.528 --> 00:05:49.611
is equal to the ideal pressure.

00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:51.510
Now, what's interesting about this is,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:52.654
Van der Waals said, well

00:05:52.654 --> 00:05:55.128
if I assume that this is ideal pressure,

00:05:55.128 --> 00:05:59.290
and this is ideal volume, well
maybe I could just replace

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.422
the P sub i, the ideal pressure,

00:06:01.422 --> 00:06:03.533
with this thing right over here.

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.158
And that's what he does,
so we're gonna slowly

00:06:05.158 --> 00:06:08.019
reconstruct the Van der Waals equation.

00:06:08.019 --> 00:06:10.616
So instead of that, he has

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:14.614
P sub the real pressure,
plus, and this looks like

00:06:14.614 --> 00:06:16.445
this wacky stuff, hard to understand,

00:06:16.445 --> 00:06:19.843
but hopefully this makes a
little bit of sense that look,

00:06:19.843 --> 00:06:23.070
the real pressure is gonna be
less than the ideal pressure,

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.254
it's gonna be the ideal
pressure minus something,

00:06:25.254 --> 00:06:27.160
or you can say that the ideal pressure

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.171
is gonna be the real
pressure plus something.

00:06:29.171 --> 00:06:32.773
And that plus something
is related to the density

00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:37.037
of the actual molecules, and
there's gonna some constant

00:06:37.037 --> 00:06:39.595
that's given for that gas.

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:42.201
And, I've only seen positive ones here,

00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:44.384
which imply an attractive force,

00:06:44.384 --> 00:06:47.787
but, if you had a repulsive,
but I won't even get into that,

00:06:47.787 --> 00:06:52.751
I've only seen positive a
values used for actual gases,

00:06:52.751 --> 00:06:55.082
so they're really talking
about attractive forces there.

00:06:55.082 --> 00:06:58.660
And then we're gonna do
something about the volume.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.771
We're gonna do something about
the volume right over here.

00:07:01.771 --> 00:07:05.398
So we're gonna have the
real, the volume sub real,

00:07:05.398 --> 00:07:06.928
we're gonna add or subtract something,

00:07:06.928 --> 00:07:10.428
and then this is going to be equal to nRT.

00:07:11.612 --> 00:07:13.838
Now, let's think about
how we'd want to adjust

00:07:13.838 --> 00:07:16.560
real volume relative to ideal volume.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.381
So let me draw another
container really quickly.

00:07:21.381 --> 00:07:25.594
So, in this container, I'm
gonna challenge assumption two

00:07:25.594 --> 00:07:27.854
and we're gonna assume
that these molecules,

00:07:27.854 --> 00:07:30.832
that their volume is not negligible.

00:07:30.832 --> 00:07:33.217
And so in this case or situation,

00:07:33.217 --> 00:07:34.501
holding everything else constant,

00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:37.166
if you want the same
pressure, and everything else

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.414
is constant, your real
volume, in order to have

00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:42.255
the same pressure, is
gonna have to be larger.

00:07:42.255 --> 00:07:46.679
The real volume, V sub r,
needs to be greater than

00:07:46.679 --> 00:07:48.276
the ideal volume.

00:07:48.276 --> 00:07:49.616
Why does it have to be greater?

00:07:49.616 --> 00:07:51.504
Well, in order to have, if you don't make

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.574
the volume greater, these
things are gonna bump

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:56.252
into each other a lot
more, 'cause they're each

00:07:56.252 --> 00:07:58.606
taking up a lot more space
than you would've assumed,

00:07:58.606 --> 00:08:00.649
than you would've assumed

00:08:00.649 --> 00:08:02.792
under the negligible volume assumption.

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:05.383
And so if they're bumping
into each other a lot more

00:08:05.383 --> 00:08:07.029
and ricocheting off of each a lot more,

00:08:07.029 --> 00:08:09.071
if you held the volume constant,

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:10.383
you would have more pressure,

00:08:10.383 --> 00:08:12.228
but if you want to hold
the pressure constant,

00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:13.771
well you've got to make the volume bigger,

00:08:13.771 --> 00:08:17.452
the real volume has to be
greater than the ideal volume.

00:08:17.452 --> 00:08:18.815
And by how much?

00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:20.506
Well, the real volume

00:08:20.506 --> 00:08:23.308
could be equal to the ideal volume,

00:08:23.308 --> 00:08:24.664
and you just need to make space

00:08:24.664 --> 00:08:26.942
for the volume of the actual molecules.

00:08:26.942 --> 00:08:31.558
So the ideal volume plus space
for the actual molecules.

00:08:31.558 --> 00:08:34.403
And so, we could multiply some constant

00:08:34.403 --> 00:08:36.986
times the number of
molecules measured in moles.

00:08:36.986 --> 00:08:38.364
And this b would be related to,

00:08:38.364 --> 00:08:40.070
essentially the size of the molecules.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.105
You can even think of it as
kind of a bigness factor.

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:44.197
You can think of this a bit
as an attractive factor,

00:08:44.197 --> 00:08:46.632
and this is a bigness factor.

00:08:46.632 --> 00:08:49.390
And once again, algebraically
manipulating this,

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:52.931
you would get the real
volume minus the volume

00:08:52.931 --> 00:08:57.435
of our actual molecules, is
equal to the ideal volume.

00:08:57.435 --> 00:08:59.415
And we can go back and substitute that in.

00:08:59.415 --> 00:09:01.376
This whole thing is the ideal volume,

00:09:01.376 --> 00:09:04.678
so the ideal volume is
equal to the real volume

00:09:04.678 --> 00:09:06.907
minus some proportionality constant,

00:09:06.907 --> 00:09:10.117
times the number of
molecules measured in moles.

00:09:10.117 --> 00:09:13.184
And this thing that I have just generated,

00:09:13.184 --> 00:09:15.726
this is the Van der Waals equation.

00:09:15.726 --> 00:09:17.338
And the reason why I
went through this little,

00:09:17.338 --> 00:09:21.063
hopefully conceptual
experiment thinking through it,

00:09:21.063 --> 00:09:22.131
is that, at first when you see,

00:09:22.131 --> 00:09:23.646
it looks really, really daunting

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:26.410
until you realize that this first thing,

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.938
this first thing right over here,

00:09:27.938 --> 00:09:29.532
that's just the ideal pressure,

00:09:29.532 --> 00:09:31.744
and then the second thing
is the ideal volume,

00:09:31.744 --> 00:09:35.548
and then we make adjustments
between the ideal and the real

00:09:35.548 --> 00:09:37.079
based on, okay, maybe we have some forces

00:09:37.079 --> 00:09:38.572
between the particles, and yeah,

00:09:38.572 --> 00:09:40.478
we have to take into
account the actual volume

00:09:40.478 --> 00:09:41.564
of the particles.

00:09:41.564 --> 00:09:43.095
And once again, the
Van der Waals equation,

00:09:43.095 --> 00:09:44.679
it is not perfect, but it's the one

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:47.762
that is typically given as a,

00:09:47.762 --> 00:09:51.028
a next version to get
a little bit more real

00:09:51.028 --> 00:09:52.238
than the Ideal Gas Law.

00:09:52.238 --> 00:09:53.778
You can continue to modify this,

00:09:53.778 --> 00:09:56.459
you can do computer models,
you can do all sorts of things

00:09:56.459 --> 00:09:58.309
that get you even more exact,

00:09:58.309 --> 00:10:00.859
but the Van der Waals
equation is a good start.
