00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
And you think of this as compressing a spring.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
When I compress the spring more and more and more, I'm storing more and more energy in it,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
likewise, with these two charges.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
When r is really small or those charges really want to fly apart,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
they want to fly off into the distance and acquire kinetic energy.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
That is when the electric potential energy is highest.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Now, we should probably quantify this mathematically.
