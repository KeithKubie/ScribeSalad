00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.839
The side effects of having too much warfarin

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:05.030
can be very serious. In fact, the depletion

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.770
of vitamin K through administration of warfarin can

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.040
actually result in significant internal bleeding, and even death.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.150
Now, just as the pharmacodynamic pathway of warfarin,

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.320
the effects warfarin has on the body can

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.200
be modulated through alleles in the VKORC1 gene.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.290
We can also the pharacokinetic pathways, or the metabolism

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.060
of Warfrin through alleles in the CYP2C9 gene, or CYP2C9.
