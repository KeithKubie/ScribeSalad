00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.196
Collagen proteins normally stick together in groups of three

00:00:04.196 --> 00:00:06.870
to form a triple helix. Now this structure is so

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.640
important and effective that it's the source of much of

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.240
the connective tissue in your body and is by far

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.420
the most abundant protein in mammals. In fact, in humans,

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.300
collagen makes up about 25 to 30% of total body

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.680
protein. That's 25 to 30% of who you are, is

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.980
this one protein. Now the very nature of the spiral

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.240
here depends on an amino acid called Glycine.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.400
The change we talked about from a couple exercises

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.210
back from a glycine to a cysteine causes

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.110
enough of a structural shift to weaken the triple

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.390
helix significantly. If you weaken this helix you're

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.140
going to weaken the very connective tissue around bones. Making

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.810
them more prone to breaking. So in this scenario

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.170
here, the change from glycine to cysteine that weakens

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.020
the helix. Do you think this an is an example of a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.150
loss of function, a gain of function, or no change in function?
