00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.120
 Every organism we know needs water to survive - it's a reason 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.510
 Makes us look for it with the utmost effort on the other planets in the universe, and consume it continuously 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.469
 And my day here on the surface of the globe. What can happen to your body if you stop drinking water? 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.800
 Of course, when we say "water" we include all fluids that contain water - such as 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.350
 Juices, soft drinks or tea. Such as the desire to breathe oxygen, thirst is the survival instinct 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.960
 H2O is the most molecule in the human body and constitutes an average of 65% 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.340
 Of the adult human body. As a universal solvent, carries nutrients and hormones in the body, coordinates 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.590
 Body temperature, supports the joints and moisturizes the eye. The body produces 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.809
 L of urine daily, and a liter and a half lose with the process of breathing, sweating and ... defecation 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.500
 It is therefore necessary for the body to replace these fluids. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.210
 The thirst center in the brain is present in the "hypothalamus" and is continuously used 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.940
 Vascular stimuli to control the amount of sodium and other substances in the body 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.149
 For example, if you are sweating profusely, the amount of blood and pressure decreases. 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.550
 The brain discovers this change and stimulates the desire to drink something, now! what happens 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.600
 If you did not stop this thirst? 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.650
 Primary signs of dryness are dry mouth followed by urine color shift 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.750
 Darker and stronger color, where the body tries to maintain more fluid. 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.520
 H2O deficiency affects the brain You may feel a mild headache and a slow response time 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.799
 And a decrease in pain. In fact when they are dry, the brain tissue shrinks 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.220
 In a study to monitor 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 The same task requires more brain effort and oxygen in dry objects compared to wet objects. 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.119
 After a day or two without fluids the body stops urinating, problems swallowing 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.310
 Suffering from muscle spasm and possibly feeling nauseous, after all this the body can survive 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.700
 Longer than non-food, and attention in digestion is not a priority at this stage 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.390
 In the end, the victims may be delirious with severe weakness in brain function, 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.549
 Interesting studies monitor older patients with hallucinations, many of whom have found 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.979
 Suffer from chronic drought in the first place, after a longer period without water 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.500
 The blood stops flowing into the skin, limiting the loss of heat but increasing 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.719
 Body temperature center. This can lead to a bluish gray swab to your skin. After 3-5 days without water 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.250
 The body begins to stop the organs and finally the brain 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.730
 Of course, unlike the oxygen we breathe abundantly, only 2.5% of the Earth's water 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.569
 Most of which are reserved for glaciers, ice caps and subterranean lakes known as aquifers, 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.620
 Making less than 1% available for drinking and the majority of this water used for growing crops 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.349
 Approximately 500 billion liters of fresh water is used daily for agriculture 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.470
 In the United States only, with another 500 billion liters used to cool electricity plants 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.550
 As drinking sources increasingly pollute, more than 783 million people are on the ground 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.690
 They do not have the ability to get fresh water 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.910
 Scientists around the world are trying to find solutions to this problem, from attempts 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.650
 To remove salt from ocean water, take advantage of groundwater and create 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.390
 Water purification system. If we look at space, NASA has developed a technique for astronauts 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.879
 The urine turns to more fresh water than we drink on the ground. But we can not 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:00.840
 We rely on technology and science only, perhaps the solution depends on us as creatures to understand 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.980
 And contribute to the global water crisis. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.370
 If you want to help with the task of ending the world thirst, participate in (World Water Day) 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.590
 On 22 March. There are many wonderful projects, such as Water.org 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.750
 Or even the wonderful UNICEF application that donates a day of fresh water 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.180
 Every 10 minutes you leave your phone. We will leave links in the description box for the two projects 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.890
 For other water charities, a small investment makes a big difference 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.209
 We will donate the full income of this video to a nearby water project named 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.310
 (Morocco is five villages) so we thank you for your support and watching. Subscribe to the channel for more scientific sections per week !!
