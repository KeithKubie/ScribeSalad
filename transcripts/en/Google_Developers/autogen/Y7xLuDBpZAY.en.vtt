00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:33.800
about this is I mean I can really
 

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.870
about this is I mean I can really
configure this thing this is an

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:36.320
interactive application I'm going to
 

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:38.800
interactive application I'm going to
switch to another model I'm gonna change

00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:38.810
switch to another model I'm gonna change
 

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:41.590

lot of beautiful shadows in there and
 

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.590
lot of beautiful shadows in there and
the lights are baked into the scene is

00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600
the lights are baked into the scene is
 

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.720
the lights are baked into the scene is
this this stuff here so that's that's

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:55.730
this this stuff here so that's that's
 

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:57.790
this this stuff here so that's that's
part of the texture map the bitmap on

completely different from that was

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:15.830
completely different from that was
 

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.530
completely different from that was
prosaic right we had a real-world

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:17.540
prosaic right we had a real-world

one's about data this is about looking

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:21.830
one's about data this is about looking
 

00:15:21.830 --> 00:15:25.000

for the last two decades now kind of a

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:29.060
for the last two decades now kind of a
 

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:30.730
for the last two decades now kind of a
sobering thought but it's very

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:30.740
sobering thought but it's very
 

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.440
sobering thought but it's very
interesting so I can actually slide

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:32.450
interesting so I can actually slide
 

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.270
interesting so I can actually slide
these sliders and go to different

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:34.280
these sliders and go to different
 

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:35.830
these sliders and go to different
periods of time look at the progression

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:35.840
periods of time look at the progression
 

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:37.450
periods of time look at the progression
of the arms trade I can look at just

00:15:37.450 --> 00:15:37.460
of the arms trade I can look at just
 

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.210
of the arms trade I can look at just
imports or just exports I can actually

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:40.220
imports or just exports I can actually
 

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:41.800
imports or just exports I can actually
zoom into detail on a certain country

00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:41.810
zoom into detail on a certain country
 

00:15:41.810 --> 00:15:43.990
zoom into detail on a certain country
like the Russian Federation and see what

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:44.000
like the Russian Federation and see what
 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.970
like the Russian Federation and see what
how they've been deal in the last few

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:45.980
how they've been deal in the last few
 

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:48.460
how they've been deal in the last few
decades and this was all built on an

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:48.470
decades and this was all built on an
 

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:50.680
decades and this was all built on an
open-source google globe project as well

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:50.690
open-source google globe project as well
 

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.420

so you could go take the data from this

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:52.430
so you could go take the data from this
 

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.730
so you could go take the data from this
or the code from this presentation but

so this is the kind of experience we're

00:16:10.750 --> 00:16:10.760
so this is the kind of experience we're
 

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:15.960
so this is the kind of experience we're
talking about WebGL being able to power

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:15.970
 
 

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:18.250
 
but it goes beyond just you know

00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:18.260
but it goes beyond just you know
 

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:20.200
but it goes beyond just you know
creating the models there's all this

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.210
creating the models there's all this
 

00:16:20.210 --> 00:16:21.910

real-time characters and how do you do
that that's a good question I asked

00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.000
that that's a good question I asked
 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.210
that that's a good question I asked
myself how do I make content for this

00:16:31.210 --> 00:16:31.220
myself how do I make content for this
 

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.430

XML files and we've been using that to

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:22.730
XML files and we've been using that to
 

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:24.400
XML files and we've been using that to
show some really sophisticated WebGL

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:24.410
show some really sophisticated WebGL
 

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:25.689
