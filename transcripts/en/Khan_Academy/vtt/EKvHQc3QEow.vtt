00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.350
This is a picture
of Isaac Newton,

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:06.040
super famous British
mathematician and physicist.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.990
This is a picture of
a Gottfried Leibnitz,

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.350
super famous, or
maybe not as famous,

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:14.350
but maybe should be,
famous German philosopher

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.480
and mathematician, and he was
a contemporary of Isaac Newton.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.940
These two gentlemen
together were really

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.570
the founding
fathers of calculus.

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.150
And they did some of their--
most of their major work

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.250
in the late 1600s.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.240
And this right over here is
Usain Bolt, Jamaican sprinter,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.070
whose continuing to do some
of his best work in 2012.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.540
And as of early 2012, he's
the fastest human alive,

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.820
and he's probably the fastest
human that has ever lived.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.231
And you might have not made the
association with these three

00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:45.730
gentleman.

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.100
You might not think that
they have a lot in common.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.070
But they were all obsessed with
the same fundamental question.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.470
And this is the same
fundamental question

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.910
that differential
calculus addresses.

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.480
And the question is, what
is the instantaneous rate

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.710
of change of something?

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.570
And in the case of Usain Bolt,
how fast is he going right now?

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.630
Not just what his average
speed was for the last second,

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.850
or his average speed
over the next 10 seconds.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.090
How fast is he going right now?

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.150
And so this is what differential
calculus is all about.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.730
Instantaneous rates of change.

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:20.980
Differential calculus.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.520
Newton's actual original term
for differential calculus

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.970
was the method of
fluxions, which

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.080
actually sounds a
little bit fancier.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.890
But it's all about what's
happening in this instant.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.350
And to think about why that
is not a super easy problem

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.880
to address with
traditional algebra, let's

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.510
draw a little graph here.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.090
So on this axis
I'll have distance.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.370
I'll say y is equal to distance.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.200
I could have said d
is equal to distance,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.500
but we'll see, especially
later on in calculus,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.190
d is reserved for
something else.

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.160
We'll say y is
equal to distance.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.532
And in this axis,
we'll say time.

00:02:01.532 --> 00:02:02.990
And I could say t
is equal to time,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.531
but I'll just say
x is equal to time.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.759
And so if we were to plot
Usain Bolt's distance

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.190
as a function of time,
well at time zero

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:13.570
he hasn't gone anywhere.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.250
He is right over there.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.750
And we know that
this gentleman is

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:23.270
capable of traveling 100
meters in 9.58 seconds.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.650
So after 9.58
seconds, we'll assume

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.550
that this is in seconds
right over here,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.420
he's capable of
going 100 meters.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.530
And so using this
information, we

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.910
can actually figure
out his average speed.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.880
Let me write it this
way, his average speed

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.700
is just going to be
his change in distance

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.469
over his change in time.

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.260
And using the variables
that are over here,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.500
we're saying y is distance.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.958
So this is the same
thing as change

00:02:54.958 --> 00:02:59.740
in y over change in x from
this point to that point.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.670
And this might look
somewhat familiar to you

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:02.780
from basic algebra.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.250
This is the slope
between these two points.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.180
If I have a line that
connects these two points,

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.070
this is the slope of that line.

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.870
The change in distance
is this right over here.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.580
Change in y is
equal to 100 meters.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.990
And our change in time
is this right over here.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.420
So our change in time is
equal to 9.58 seconds.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.270
We started at 0, we
go to 9.58 seconds.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.280
Another way to think about it,
the rise over the run you might

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.710
have heard in your
algebra class.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.780
It's going to be 100
meters over 9.58 seconds.

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.040
So this is 100 meters
over 9.58 seconds.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.404
And the slope is essentially
just rate of change,

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:47.070
or you could view it
as the average rate

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.417
of change between
these two points.

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:51.500
And you'll see, if you
even just follow the units,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.440
it gives you units
of speed here.

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.150
It would be velocity if we
also specified the direction.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.660
And we can figure
out what that is,

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:02.320
let me get the calculator out.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.590
So let me get the
calculator on the screen.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.300
So we're going 100 meters
in the 9.58 seconds.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.079
So it's 10.4, I'll just write
10.4, I'll round to 10.4.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.490
So it's approximately
10.4, and then the units

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.920
are meters per second.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.300
And that is his average speed.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.130
And what we're going
to see in a second

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.660
is how average
speed is different

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:32.930
than instantaneous speed.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.513
How it's different
than what the speed

00:04:34.513 --> 00:04:36.130
he might be going
at any given moment.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.410
And just to have a concept
of how fast this is,

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.140
let me get the calculator back.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.360
This is in meters per second.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.860
If you wanted to know how many
meters he's going in an hour,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.620
well there's 3,600
seconds in an hour.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.850
So he'll be able to go this
many meters 3,600 times.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.460
So that's how many
meters he can,

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.010
if he were able to somehow
keep up that speed in an hour.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.992
This is how fast he's
going meters per hour.

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:01.200
And then, if you were to
say how many miles per hour,

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.780
there's roughly 1600-- and I
don't know the exact number,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.390
but roughly 1600
meters per mile.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.490
So let's divide it by 1600.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.900
And so you see that this is
roughly a little over 23,

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.080
about 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.300
So this is
approximately, and I'll

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:28.800
write it this way-- this
is approximately 23.5 miles

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.850
per hour.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.670
And relative to a
car, not so fast.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.500
But relative to
me, extremely fast.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.560
Now to see how this is different
than instantaneous velocity,

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.010
let's think about a potential
plot of his distance

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:42.330
relative to time.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.785
He's not going to just go
this speed immediately.

00:05:44.785 --> 00:05:46.910
He's not just going to go
as soon as the gun fires,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.890
he's not just going to go 23 and
1/2 miles per hour all the way.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.490
He's going to accelerate.

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.210
So at first he's going to start
off going a little bit slower.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.570
So the slope is going to
be a little bit lot lower

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:57.780
than the average slope.

00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.750
He's going to go a
little bit slower,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.530
then he's going to
start accelerating.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.930
And so his speed, and
you'll see the slope here

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.040
is getting steeper and
steeper and steeper.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:09.400
And then maybe near the end he
starts tiring off a little bit.

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.520
And so his distance
plotted against time

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.022
might be a curve that
looks something like this.

00:06:14.022 --> 00:06:15.480
And what we calculated
here is just

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.039
the average slope across
this change in time.

00:06:20.039 --> 00:06:21.580
What we could see
at any given moment

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.320
the slope is actually different.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.680
In the beginning,
he has a slower rate

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.860
of change of distance.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.830
Then over here, then he
accelerates over here,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.840
it seems like his rate of
change of distance, which

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.464
would be roughly--
or you could view it

00:06:34.464 --> 00:06:36.880
as the slope of the
tangent line at that point,

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:38.770
it looks higher
than his average.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:40.680
And then he starts
to slow down again.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.840
When you average it out, it gets
to 23 and 1/2 miles per hour.

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.830
And I looked it up, Usain
Bolt's instantaneous velocity,

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:49.550
his peak instantaneous
velocity, is actually

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:51.300
closer to 30 miles per hour.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:54.800
So the slope over here might
be 23 whatever miles per hour.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.000
But the instantaneous,
his fastest point

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.220
in this 9.58 seconds is
closer to 30 miles per hour.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:03.550
But you see it's not
a trivial thing to do.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.520
You could say, OK, let me try
to approximate the slope right

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.690
over here.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.440
And you could do that
by saying, OK, well,

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.200
what is the change in y over the
change of x right around this?

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.230
So you could say, well, let
me take some change of x,

00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.810
and figure out what the
change of y is around it,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:23.280
or as we go past that.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:23.990
So you get that.

00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.310
But that would just
be an approximation,

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:27.143
because you see that
the slope of this curve

00:07:27.143 --> 00:07:28.590
is constantly changing.

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.240
So what you want
to do is see what

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.620
happens as your change
of x gets smaller

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:33.620
and smaller and smaller.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.830
As your change of x get smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.660
you're going to get a better
and better approximation.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.390
Your change of y is
going to get smaller

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.630
and smaller and smaller.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:41.700
So what you want
to do, and we're

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:43.366
going to go into depth
into all of this,

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:44.950
and study it more
rigorously, is you

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:49.270
want to take the limit
as delta x approaches

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:57.540
0 of your change in y
over your change in x.

00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.300
And when you do
that, you're going

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.967
to approach that
instantaneous rate of change.

00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:04.800
You could view it as
the instantaneous slope

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.010
at that point in the curve.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:08.690
Or the slope of the tangent
line at that point in the curve.

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.280
Or if we use
calculus terminology,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.730
we would view that
as the derivative.

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:17.080
So the instantaneous
slope is the derivative.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.290
And the notation we use for
the derivative is a dy over dx.

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:24.300
And that's why I
reserved the letter y.

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.850
And then you say,
well, how does this

00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:28.070
relate to the word differential?

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:30.350
Well, the word
differential is relating--

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:33.760
this dy is a differential,
dx is a differential.

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.460
And one way to
conceptualize it, this

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.679
is an infinitely
small change in y

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:40.299
over an infinitely
small change in x.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.970
And by getting super,
super small changes in y

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.190
over change in x, you're able
to get your instantaneous slope.

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.730
Or in the case of this example,
the instantaneous speed

00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:53.300
of Usain Bolt right
at that moment.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.100
And notice, you can't
just put a 0 here.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.752
If you just put
change in x is zero,

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.710
you're going to get
something that's undefined.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.140
You can't divide by 0.

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.829
So we take the limit
as it approaches 0.

00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:04.370
And we'll define
that more rigorously

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:06.500
in the next few videos.
