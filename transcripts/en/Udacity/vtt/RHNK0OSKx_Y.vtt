00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.990
Now, let's wrap up this entire unit and our entire course by trying to solve

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.065
some equations with logarithms. For this equation, we'll have log base 2 of 64

00:00:11.065 --> 00:00:16.355
equals x. What I want you to do is to try and change this log form into

00:00:16.355 --> 00:00:22.850
exponential form, and then solve for x. You can write the value of x here.
