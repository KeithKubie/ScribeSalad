00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 in his capsule goodbye the notion of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.610
 partial derivatives and bleachers then 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.320
 an automatic learning what will 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.090
 to interest us is to have 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.089
 information on variations of 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.500
 function but what to do and functions 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.720
 who not only depend on one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 argument x but several arguments 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.880
 in fact what will interest us these 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 two to study there and exploit from 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 information about the relationship between the 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.900
 loss of an algorithm and with respect to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.130
 these settings actually they these 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.079
 settings will have several 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.200
 a bit like in the tax collector we have 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.969
 all a weight vector w that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.540
 correspond to all the parameters of the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.020
 collector 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.660
 then in what if what we need 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.850
 it's partial derivatives for 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.710
 get information on the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.079
 variation of a function but by 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.770
 report to each of his arguments to 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.870
 each of these input variables so 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:00.660
 the partial dlv is actually drifting 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.600
 and but applied to a function where we go 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 consider that we will consider 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.330
 only variable at a time and all the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.600
 other variables will be considered 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:12.780
 as being constant here we have the body 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.250
 special two input variables of a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.670
 function for a function that two 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.909
 only arguments and drift and 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.939
 partial of this function f ii x2 y 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.590
 compared to x in a derby that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.350
 partial because we are interested in 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.250
 derives a report to a single argument that 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.680
 is going to be the limit of a gap that tends 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:41.000
 to zero delta gap where we 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 is interested in f2 x + delta and y - f2 x / 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.640
 the size of the delta team and the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.070
 same way if we are interested in drifting 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:56.009
 and partial of fgx compared to f2 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.380
 xy sorry about y only 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.140
 have exactly the same definition but 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.560
 where the gap is going to be added to y rather 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.869
 that be added to x ok so that's 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.239
 really finally there from the definition 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.229
 of the hervé applied in the tale of 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.790
 several variables 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.890
 elop because 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.629
 we talk about partial derivatives because 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.099
 we are interested in variations 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:22.290
 associated with a single variable so 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:25.260
 it's partial in relation to a variable 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.909
 given we will consider that others 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:33.900
 variables are actually constant 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:35.730
 when we do our innovation then 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:37.650
 take things a little more concretely 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 let's do some examples 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.810
 but I do not know a function f2 xy 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.239
 which corresponds to aix squared / mixing 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.389
 what if the partial derivatives of f2 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.829
 xy compared to x it's going to be tight 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:56.099
 correspond to drifting and 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.230
 this expression there too explore / y 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.829
 but where we will treat it like a 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.889
 constant 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:04.919
 so if we drift and two ex 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:08.129
 traoré / a constant is actually the 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:10.500
 beginning of his versus x the drift and 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.750
 of a function once a constant that's 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.549
 the constant times the derivative of the 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.159
 function so in this case it would have 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:19.349
 one on a Greek times the last two 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.739
 ex square with respect to xp the drift and 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:27.599
 of the ex-quarter and compared to x and 2x 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.569
 so we'll see 2 x / y mixing bousquet 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.180
 of the derivative of f2 x and y with respect to 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.829
 there only received to explore how 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.900
 consider as a constant one 

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.819
 consider x as a constant so 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.449
 explore is also a constant by 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:47.370
 report by will and in this case we will 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:49.409
 see the drift and a constant / y 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.470
 so that's going to be the constant for the 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:56.220
 derby 2-1 on y the derivative of one on y 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:01.049
 it's less safe, so we'll see 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:03.449
 - ex square / there is when we made here 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.939
 have applied the procedure to calculate 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:07.829
 a derivative my entry txcom and at a 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:11.030
 constant then were there in this case 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.030
 if not a barrier of interest 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.820
 a second example let's imagine that I 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.060
 a function that depend on a vector 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:28.240
 x so existence convectors with 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:30.130
 the element x1 x2 and x3 hockey and the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.750
 imagine that I want to calculate the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.669
 hervé this function that takes 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.620
 an input vector but with respect to 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:39.430
 a single variable 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:42.699
 in this case also x1 and well what are we going 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:45.430
 do is we are going to treat x2 and x3 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.380
 as being constants and so that 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.160
 is equivalent to doing drifting and a 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:53.340
 function f2 ixquick it's a scalar where 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.389
 we would have the exponential two ex that is 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.539
 the exponential of elections so I 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:01.030
 loaded x factor x then in fact I 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:04.320
 changed the numerator here that depends 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.289
 dexter for a constant so to your 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.419
 the experience he dexter then ben saada 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:11.949
 is actually the other part that depends 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.380
 other variables but that I'm dealing with 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:16.419
 like soap constants x2 x3 so 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:19.360
 lower the head experience x 2 more 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.190
 the exponential of ex 3 when in front 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.440
 and we're going to drift and that 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.090
 expression there in relation to x we're going 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.210
 treat all the other terms as 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:34.720
 being findings so I have my function 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:37.659
 which depends on a single school problem then 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:42.729
 if I do the top derivative on space 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:45.880
 2 x + b is the equivalent of doing the 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:48.130
 drift is so finally I read it derived 

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.900
 up on the thoughts of the explosive 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:51.789
 and compared to x so what I have 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:55.500
 done here is that I put all my 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:59.710
 function next to the derived operator 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.210
 rather than putting it here just for 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.740
 that the expression evening is easier 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:04.750
 to watch 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.759
 so that's a notation that often 

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.590
 used to simplify a little bit on 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.669
 just wants to put the derivative operator 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:18.490
 various dvx to the left of the expression whose 

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:19.990
 we hope we do not make it 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.770
 drift and that expression there by 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.930
 report to x 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:25.300
 so we have a constant time a 

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.550
 function of x so that was if I will be 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.480
 sunrise 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:32.580
 constant sometimes the function that 1 on 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.350
 experience it explosives and my 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.410
 time I do I can drift 

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:40.380
 is one on my function here certainly 

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:43.530
 equal to - 1 on my square function of which 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:47.220
 genre - o on the explosive experience 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:49.110
 and squared times drift and what 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.690
 remains to know the experiment she explodes 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.210
 b the derivative of the experience of the ex 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.860
 more b I can do is derived from 

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:58.290
 the yale experience of x factor 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.540
 the exponential 2x plus drift and of 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.250
 babies report to xv is a constant 

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.260
 so it's zero so I have left 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:05.330
 only the 2x exponential we 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.580
 find here 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:10.770
 so my students xperia x10 drift - 

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:13.050
 offers a hendrix experience divides the 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:19.410
 respect by yale experience of explodes 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:22.350
 drunk and so finally I'm 

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.460
 ready to take my expression for excess 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:28.560
 for b and replaced it with what 

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:31.290
 really corresponds to know his lands 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:34.080
 experiential ii x2 qpc the experience and 

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:37.320
 mx2 plus the experience of the former 3 then 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.360
 equivalent error replaced by the value 

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:41.730
 original which was x1 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.800
 which means that the expo the derivatives 

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.050
 partial of f2 x compared to 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:50.190
 first elements of the fixed vector by 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:53.480
 relation to xp is sometimes the experience 

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:56.450
 he of x so if I replace c - 

00:07:53.480 --> 00:08:00.060
 expanding guides twice 

00:07:56.450 --> 00:08:01.920
 ldx experience 1 / exploration is 

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:04.320
 explosive and squared if I replace 

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:07.100
 the experiential one of x1 which is a 

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:10.260
 hendrix experience here most beautiful feat 

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:12.500
 62.7 france yale ii x3 alone to 

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.500
 quarters 

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.600
 third example let's take the same 

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.510
 function but now we will do the 

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:23.990
 deliberation the partial drift by 

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:26.520
 report to x2 the second element of x 

00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:28.800
 men years that if because we have two 

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.810
 in the numerator the numerator repent 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.970
 constant with the experience he of x but 

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:34.290
 we will still have b &amp; b in this case 

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.060
 maybe going exponential of ex in 

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:40.010
 plus the experience and alex three so the 

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:40.010
 terms that do not depend on and kz2 

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:48.240
 so we drift and fgx that goes 

00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:52.650
 here space and dx10 by experience it 

00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:55.740
 expels b so we actually have the dlv of 

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:58.170
 a function of x / another function 

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.520
 of x that means we have the derivative of 

00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:02.940
 the last function of the xth in the numerator 

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:06.780
 expanse of experts in paris xx 1 on 

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:10.500
 the experience he expels b - the 

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:13.350
 numerator / denominator squared 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:16.230
 times the derivative of the denominator which 

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:18.690
 the experience of the express b derby 

00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:21.180
 experience nfc experience and experience 

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:25.710
 1 on the experience he expels b that we 

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:28.710
 found here - the exponential of xxx 

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:29.850
 the dlv of that here the excerpt from 

00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.640
 experience and explosives 

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.590
 because it's a consistency the dfb not 

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.260
 like it's zero stays all the drift 

00:09:34.590 --> 00:09:39.180
 of expansion x versus x which is 

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.260
 experience and aix so in two times 

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.120
 by ac / dc 

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:46.050
 in fact I could have removed that I 

00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:48.240
 know how to write expansible x squared / 

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:53.850
 the term here who has the experience and of 

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:55.530
 the express bu squared is still a 

00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:57.230
 times well all that was terms 

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:59.550
 that we internship for finally the 

00:09:57.230 --> 00:10:02.370
 replace with the original expression or 

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:05.220
 b will become the experience he 1.7 times 

00:10:02.370 --> 00:10:06.530
 that of three ex will become external 

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.320
 what gives me 

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:12.060
 the expression here so in the examples 

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.830
 in fact what I did what I 

00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:14.970
 started by identifying what is that 

00:10:13.830 --> 00:10:17.250
 was a constant with respect to 

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:20.700
 variable so for which I was doing 

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:22.380
 there of partial hervé then the variable which 

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.880
 interested me in what I 

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.360
 doing 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:28.580
 the dlv character replaced by x i 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:30.860
 might not do that explicitly 

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.450
 and then just implicitly derived pharma 

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.210
 partial then simply treat 

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:36.680
 all the other variables that are not 

00:10:35.210 --> 00:10:38.720
 released from which I am doing 

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.960
 derivatives as constants I have 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.950
 just made an example here for 

00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:47.270
 explicitly I replaced all 

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:49.310
 terms which which was constant by 

00:10:47.270 --> 00:10:50.840
 report to me yable by see 

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:53.090
 which I was doing partial hervé 

00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.040
 I replaced them with terms like 

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.960
 a and b that I often use as 

00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:58.760
 constant just to reinforce the fact 

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:01.660
 that I treat them as constants 

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.950
 but it's not obliged to always 

00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.170
 identify the constants of the replaced 

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.490
 by terms like alp to do the 

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:09.500
 partial derivatives it's just for 

00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:13.750
 illustrate the fact that they are treated 

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.750
 in deflation as findings 

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:18.920
 now with the notion derived 

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:23.090
 partial 

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.680
 we will be able to introduce a rule the 

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.480
 rule of chain derivatives that go into 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.490
 allows us to calculate 

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.530
 derivatives on arbitrary expressions 

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.990
 we would have convictions of 

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:37.250
 forgiveness combinations arbitrarily 

00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:39.980
 function complex so we promised 

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:42.830
 than that which is a function f 2 x 

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:45.820
 that we can write as being calculated at 

00:11:42.830 --> 00:11:49.690
 from an intermediate function j2x 

00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:51.860
 and when if drift and f2 xperia 

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:54.020
 x1 can always be calculated as 

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:57.110
 being the drift and 2.6 relative to my 

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:59.420
 intermediate function j2x times the der 

00:11:57.110 --> 00:12:03.170
 wiel of gdx by device you did that 

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:06.890
 we are already familiar with that we saw by 

00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:11.150
 example if I want to calculate the drift and 

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:14.980
 of the nancial exhibition of an af function 

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:18.950
 x or if I want to calculate that in relation to 

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:21.290
 xbc actually equals the drift and of 

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.640
 the expo did not sky f2 x compared to 

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:26.720
 Africa what is to be 

00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:31.100
 exponential dream of x times the 

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:34.040
 drift and f2 x para para x ok so we 

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:36.209
 is already doing well in co des 

00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:37.800
 examples of this rule 

00:12:36.209 --> 00:12:42.509
 more general that is true for anyone 

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.819
 what function and so it's really 

00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:45.769
 a more general formulation of some 

00:12:44.819 --> 00:12:47.970
 thing for the job 

00:12:45.769 --> 00:12:50.819
 now what he new is also 

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:54.059
 the rule of chain diversion or 

00:12:50.819 --> 00:12:57.119
 do our function of x is expressed 

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:59.730
 by is expressed from results 

00:12:57.119 --> 00:13:02.819
 intermediates of more than one result 

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:06.600
 intermediate geii 2 x and in this case 

00:13:02.819 --> 00:13:09.300
 also the drift and 6 relative to x 

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:12.209
 we will be able to write it as a sum 

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:15.600
 especially the intermediate results of 

00:13:12.209 --> 00:13:17.009
 the derivative of f2 x with respect to j 2 x 

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.449
 so here it's really a drift and 

00:13:17.009 --> 00:13:20.040
 partial because we will do it by 

00:13:18.449 --> 00:13:23.160
 report to only one of the results 

00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:26.179
 intermediaries j2x both the drift and of 

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:29.189
 gdx with respect to x we ​​will do the sum 

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:30.779
 of these drift products is there for 

00:13:29.189 --> 00:13:36.709
 all the functions 

00:13:30.779 --> 00:13:39.600
 geii intermediates of x example reasons 

00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:41.519
 imagine the function eve 2x which 

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:46.699
 equal to 4 exponential points of 

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:49.199
 explodes three times a ce1 plus x at the 3 

00:13:46.699 --> 00:13:51.029
 and now imagine that as 

00:13:49.199 --> 00:13:53.040
 intermediate results as functions 

00:13:51.029 --> 00:13:55.499
 intermediates identified g12 x as 

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:59.040
 being the exponential of x86 

00:13:55.499 --> 00:14:02.579
 and then I have 2 x 2 fighters plus x 

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:05.970
 find here so we can write f 2 x 

00:14:02.579 --> 00:14:10.049
 committing four times j 1 2x plus three 

00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:11.429
 times I have 2 2x at the three is good with 

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:13.709
 the rule has diverged 

00:14:11.429 --> 00:14:16.410
 everything I need to calculate a 

00:14:13.709 --> 00:14:19.740
 eric's fault like that is the drift and 

00:14:16.410 --> 00:14:22.709
 of fgx compared to June of 6 in derry 

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:27.179
 partial of f / 2 8 gx ratio drift 

00:14:22.709 --> 00:14:28.769
 and of jr 2 x compared to x plus so 

00:14:27.179 --> 00:14:31.980
 I'm multiplying my fingers together 

00:14:28.769 --> 00:14:34.499
 in my bypass street h &amp; m plus the 

00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:37.139
 drift and fgx by barges and dx 

00:14:34.499 --> 00:14:40.649
 of partial evry times the drift and doji of 

00:14:37.139 --> 00:14:43.499
 drake with respect to x so the der screw of 

00:14:40.649 --> 00:14:48.170
 f2 extra legal it had to leave 

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:50.269
 arsenic by gntx so that's 

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:52.339
 here I'm drifting and this 

00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:53.870
 expression there just compared to 2.6 or 

00:14:52.339 --> 00:14:57.290
 g2 extracts a constant 

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:59.510
 it just gives 4 actually 

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:02.120
 kind four times I indicate its derivative 

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:04.040
 of his c4 plus a term here that is a 

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:06.860
 constant which depends on gedo of aix but 

00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:08.329
 which does not depend on embarrassment of x so that's me 

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:12.079
 gives partial lifts by vagina 

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:14.120
 to exploit 4 drift and June 2 x 

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.680
 I had an excellent exponential of x 

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.699
 so the beginning by paris 

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:25.279
 however that of the 2x dgf loaded with 

00:15:19.699 --> 00:15:29.380
 partial dx by angers 2 2 x it'll be 

00:15:25.279 --> 00:15:33.769
 so that of hervé compared to j-2 dx60 

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:37.310
 and more three times the grid of three 

00:15:33.769 --> 00:15:42.709
 times I had xsara 3 so that's fine 

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:46.760
 give 3 x 3 to the 6 9 times g2x to the 3 - 1 

00:15:42.709 --> 00:15:49.880
 so two kinds nine times g2x to 

00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:52.699
 the adult and finally the der wiel of 

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:56.120
 gide or ex with respect to x kind the 

00:15:52.699 --> 00:15:58.339
 derby 2-1 exquisite 0 more there reed 

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:01.190
 expo report to aix that is important to 

00:15:58.339 --> 00:16:02.870
 give derby which is equal to medan with 

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:04.940
 the shange rule shange small 

00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:07.880
 combined his whole people even four 

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:13.910
 times the exponential 2x found here 

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:18.529
 + 9 times I have two at a time I had x 

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:22.190
 squared times a name done here I have a 

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:25.640
 mistake of having 2006 so more nine times 

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:29.000
 I have dxo square times a red has succeeded 

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:31.899
 but I do not need anything 

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.510
 is 1 something in question 

00:16:31.899 --> 00:16:40.490
 so that gives me four of the experience 

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:44.690
 and the 2 x + 9 times I had to exki a +6 

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:46.339
 when we're here at the cable so it's a 

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:48.769
 example the derivation application in 

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:50.630
 chain that actually allows us to do 

00:16:48.769 --> 00:16:56.630
 a drift and for expressions that 

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:59.600
 are arbitrarily complex and 

00:16:56.630 --> 00:17:01.310
 finally see the concept of gradient in 

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:05.209
 does it's a concept that is very 

00:17:01.310 --> 00:17:08.659
 simple so the gradient of a function f 

00:17:05.209 --> 00:17:10.579
 that we want noted by a delta the reverse of 

00:17:08.659 --> 00:17:12.230
 f 

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.600
 maybe it's just the vector 

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:16.459
 which will contain all the drifts and 

00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.980
 partial of f 

00:17:16.459 --> 00:17:21.470
 relative to each of these variables 

00:17:18.980 --> 00:17:24.620
 input for example if we had the 

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:30.620
 function f xy previously planned 

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:31.730
 so they have fxy equals x squared 

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.260
 / y 

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:37.429
 this is the first example we saw in 

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:39.770
 this capsule then the gradient of this 

00:17:37.429 --> 00:17:41.390
 function there it's going to be the vector or the 

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:44.390
 first element is the deranged 

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.860
 partial of f2 xy with respect to x then 

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:48.679
 the second element is going to be the one of evry 

00:17:45.860 --> 00:17:51.679
 partial of xy pupils compared to y 

00:17:48.679 --> 00:17:53.990
 are and in this case we had 

00:17:51.679 --> 00:17:57.530
 calculated that the partial derivatives by 

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:59.900
 report to and it was 2 x / y the hervé 

00:17:57.530 --> 00:18:03.950
 partial compared to y it was less x 

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:06.530
 squared / so will be the gradian in 

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:09.309
 this case it's going to be a vector where 

00:18:06.530 --> 00:18:13.549
 each of the elements is an expression 

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:16.040
 relative to our variables x and y is 

00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:17.990
 so this function 

00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:19.880
 this gradient designer is something 

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:23.059
 something that is going to be useful in fact for 

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.919
 analyze the variations over the 

00:18:23.059 --> 00:18:26.900
 behavior of a function when 

00:18:24.919 --> 00:18:30.620
 a function that contains more than one 

00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:31.940
 variable in in the gradient in this 

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.010
 sector there is actually the information 

00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:37.340
 on the variation of the function by 

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:41.530
 relation to each of our variables that 

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.530
 so departure our function
