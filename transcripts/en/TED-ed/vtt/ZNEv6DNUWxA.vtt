00:00:06.238 --> 00:00:07.849
We always ask people,

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.192
"What took you so long?"

00:00:09.192 --> 00:00:10.752
And this is an interesting question

00:00:10.752 --> 00:00:13.341
because when you ask somebody this,

00:00:13.341 --> 00:00:15.267
it's completely open to their interpretation

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.137
of what you mean.

00:00:16.137 --> 00:00:17.842
Sometimes somebody thinks,

00:00:17.842 --> 00:00:18.731
"What took me so long

00:00:18.731 --> 00:00:21.863
to get to this location I'm at now?"

00:00:21.863 --> 00:00:23.171
Sometimes it's, "What took me so long

00:00:23.171 --> 00:00:24.779
to get to the point of my career

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.740
where I'm at right now?"

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.192
And it's interesting

00:00:28.192 --> 00:00:30.813
because you get to learn a little bit about that person

00:00:30.813 --> 00:00:33.489
depending on how they answer the question,

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.817
and I think that's fascinating insight

00:00:35.817 --> 00:00:38.504
into somebody's personality.
