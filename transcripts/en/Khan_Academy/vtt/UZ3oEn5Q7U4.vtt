00:00:00.185 --> 00:00:01.703
- [Instructor] In the
last video we talk about

00:00:01.703 --> 00:00:05.704
the first 200 years of Rome
being an official empire,

00:00:05.704 --> 00:00:09.005
starting with Augustus in 27 BCE,

00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.171
going all the way to Marcus Aurelius,

00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:13.058
and that time period is referred to

00:00:13.058 --> 00:00:15.170
as Pax Romana, Roman Peace.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.111
It's a relatively stable,

00:00:16.111 --> 00:00:18.944
relatively peaceful time for Rome.

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:21.073
Now all of that is relative.

00:00:21.073 --> 00:00:22.504
If you're one of the tribes

00:00:22.504 --> 00:00:24.991
that are still fighting
with the Roman legions,

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:27.984
if you're one of the roughly 1/4 to 1/3

00:00:27.984 --> 00:00:29.909
of the population that is a slave,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.429
you might not view this
as such a good time.

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:33.866
But things only get worse

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:36.366
after the death of Marcus Aurelius,

00:00:36.366 --> 00:00:38.651
who's viewed as the last
of the five good emperors,

00:00:38.651 --> 00:00:39.931
so to speak.

00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:41.685
His son, Commodus, takes over,

00:00:41.685 --> 00:00:44.596
and Commodus is the beginning
of a succession of emperors

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:47.263
who are less and less competent.

00:00:48.553 --> 00:00:51.101
The Empire becomes more and more corrupt,

00:00:51.101 --> 00:00:52.608
less and less stable,

00:00:52.608 --> 00:00:54.291
and things really come to a head

00:00:54.291 --> 00:00:56.860
and start to decelerate even further,

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.027
or I guess accelerate downward
even further, in 235 CE

00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:07.605
when the emperor Severus
Alexander is assassinated,

00:01:07.605 --> 00:01:11.097
and this throws the empire
into a 50-year crisis

00:01:11.097 --> 00:01:14.278
called the Third Century Crisis

00:01:14.278 --> 00:01:16.737
because it happened in the third century.

00:01:16.737 --> 00:01:20.904
And over this 50 years, there's
26 claimants to emperor.

00:01:21.975 --> 00:01:25.661
The empire is temporarily split
into three different states.

00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:29.181
There's attacks from the
east from the Sassanids,

00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.380
the Sassanian Empire,
they're the successors

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.042
to the Parthians.

00:01:33.042 --> 00:01:35.909
You have attacks across
the Rhine and the Danube

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.763
from Germanic tribes.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:41.745
All of that makes this a very
unstable period for Rome.

00:01:41.745 --> 00:01:44.269
Now the Third Century
Crisis is considered to end

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:47.602
in 284 with the ascension of Diocletian,

00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:52.621
and Diocletian is viewed as a somewhat,

00:01:52.621 --> 00:01:55.204
or a reasonably strong emperor.

00:01:56.092 --> 00:01:57.952
He's known as the last emperor

00:01:57.952 --> 00:01:59.831
that really persecuted the Christians

00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:03.233
because they didn't
follow the Roman religion,

00:02:03.233 --> 00:02:07.318
they did not worship the emperor as a god,

00:02:07.318 --> 00:02:10.143
but he's also, or maybe
he's most famous for

00:02:10.143 --> 00:02:11.740
splitting the empire.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.819
He decides that probably
one of the main causes

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.485
of the Third Century Crisis is that

00:02:16.485 --> 00:02:18.657
the empire has gotten too vast.

00:02:18.657 --> 00:02:19.838
It has too many borders.

00:02:19.838 --> 00:02:23.846
It's hard for one emperor to
administer the whole thing,

00:02:23.846 --> 00:02:26.652
so he splits it into East and West

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:28.389
from an administrative point of view.

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:30.465
They don't become separate empires,

00:02:30.465 --> 00:02:33.304
but he decides that he is going to rule

00:02:33.304 --> 00:02:35.629
from the East and that he will have

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.934
a co-emperor who rules from the West.

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:40.605
And not only does he set that up,

00:02:40.605 --> 00:02:43.443
but he sets up what's called a tetrarchy.

00:02:43.443 --> 00:02:45.693
Beyond himself and his co-emperor,

00:02:45.693 --> 00:02:48.297
they each have a second-in-command

00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:50.286
that if any one of them were to die

00:02:50.286 --> 00:02:52.247
or would have to retire somehow,

00:02:52.247 --> 00:02:54.394
that that second-in-command
could take over,

00:02:54.394 --> 00:02:56.155
and once again, this is to
address some of the issues

00:02:56.155 --> 00:02:58.980
of the Third Century Crisis where the wars

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.565
for succession, and this isn't just during

00:03:00.565 --> 00:03:01.639
the Third Century Crisis.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.126
We've seen it in multiple videos.

00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:05.610
Rome is famous, even
during the Pax Romana,

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.869
for these really ugly succession battles,

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:11.509
but as we'll see, the
splitting of the empire

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:13.024
into East and West, even though it started

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.814
as an administrative
thing, over time it's going

00:03:15.814 --> 00:03:17.782
to become a real split
and they're going to turn

00:03:17.782 --> 00:03:20.627
into two different empires.

00:03:20.627 --> 00:03:24.811
Now after Diocletian, you have
another significant emperor.

00:03:24.811 --> 00:03:26.844
You have Constantine,

00:03:26.844 --> 00:03:30.261
and Constantine is known for many things.

00:03:31.338 --> 00:03:34.615
Maybe most famously, he
embraced Christianity,

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:37.764
as opposed to Diocletian
who persecuted Christians,

00:03:37.764 --> 00:03:41.902
you have the Council of
Nicaea and the Nicaean Code

00:03:41.902 --> 00:03:44.804
where there's now a
uniform church doctrine

00:03:44.804 --> 00:03:46.039
around Christianity.

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:50.400
He has the Edict of Milan,
which makes Christianity

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.730
legal under Roman rule.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.680
Maybe most famously on his deathbed,

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.957
he gets baptized.

00:03:55.957 --> 00:03:58.546
He becomes the first Christian emperor.

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:00.963
He also moves the capital to,

00:04:01.865 --> 00:04:06.820
officially moves the capital
of the entire empire,

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.653
to what at the time was Byzantium,

00:04:10.514 --> 00:04:13.373
but then he renames it to Constantinople,

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:14.706
named after him.

00:04:15.552 --> 00:04:18.765
Now it was still one unified empire,

00:04:18.765 --> 00:04:22.082
even Diocletian who
co-ruled with a co-emperor,

00:04:22.082 --> 00:04:26.134
he had veto power over
the emperor to the West.

00:04:26.134 --> 00:04:30.505
Now as we get further into
the fourth century here,

00:04:30.505 --> 00:04:32.112
and especially into the fifth century,

00:04:32.112 --> 00:04:35.211
we'll see that the empire
further and further fragments,

00:04:35.211 --> 00:04:39.201
and gets diluted, and
really just breaks down.

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.034
One major factor in that breakdown

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:45.857
is in that fourth century, in the fourth

00:04:45.857 --> 00:04:47.609
and fifth centuries, you have a group

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:51.430
called the Huns coming
in from Central Asia,

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.569
coming in from Northern
Europe right over here,

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.438
and they are fierce, nomadic conquerors,

00:04:58.438 --> 00:05:00.555
and they're so fierce
that they start pushing

00:05:00.555 --> 00:05:04.021
more of the Germanic
tribes across the Rhine

00:05:04.021 --> 00:05:07.341
and the Danube, and a lot
of these Germanic tribes,

00:05:07.341 --> 00:05:09.178
at first, even though their history

00:05:09.178 --> 00:05:11.524
has been fighting the
Romans, a lot of them

00:05:11.524 --> 00:05:13.518
try to seek refuge in the Roman Empire

00:05:13.518 --> 00:05:15.563
and they're given refuge
in the Roman Empire,

00:05:15.563 --> 00:05:17.378
but while they have that refuge,

00:05:17.378 --> 00:05:19.994
they're treated very, very, very badly,

00:05:19.994 --> 00:05:22.427
and all of that comes to a head in the,

00:05:22.427 --> 00:05:24.735
well I guess you could
say, the last quarter

00:05:24.735 --> 00:05:27.276
of the fourth century
with the Gothic Wars,

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:30.126
and the Gothic Wars really
have a decisive battle

00:05:30.126 --> 00:05:33.301
at Adrianople, originally Adrianopolis,

00:05:33.301 --> 00:05:36.002
named after the Emperor Hadrian.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:39.471
And at Adrianopolis, at Adrianople,

00:05:39.471 --> 00:05:42.160
the Gothic tribes in particular,

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.971
and when we say Gothic,
we're really talking

00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:46.711
about Germanic tribes, and
this one in particular,

00:05:46.711 --> 00:05:48.765
as you can see from this
legend right over here,

00:05:48.765 --> 00:05:51.400
this is the Visigoths, or Western Goths,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.877
they're able to decisively defeat

00:05:53.877 --> 00:05:56.223
the Eastern Roman Emperor Valens.

00:05:56.223 --> 00:05:58.180
He's actually killed at Adrianople,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.196
and then the Visigoths just
continue to hang out here

00:06:01.196 --> 00:06:02.863
in the Roman Empire.

00:06:03.697 --> 00:06:04.970
They continue to move forward.

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.878
In 410, they're able to actually sack Rome

00:06:08.878 --> 00:06:12.013
and they eventually settle
in the Iberian Peninsula

00:06:12.013 --> 00:06:13.763
and in Southern Gaul.

00:06:14.708 --> 00:06:17.320
Now after the Battle of Adrianople,

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.769
you have another significant
emperor, Theodosius,

00:06:20.769 --> 00:06:22.397
because what you'll see is that

00:06:22.397 --> 00:06:24.105
Diocletian persecuted Christians,

00:06:24.105 --> 00:06:26.586
Constantine now embraces Christianity,

00:06:26.586 --> 00:06:29.611
he becomes a Christian, he
says Christianity is legal.

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:32.431
Theodosius now, right
as we are about to enter

00:06:32.431 --> 00:06:35.070
into the fifth century,
he makes Christianity

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.281
the official religion of the Roman Empire.

00:06:38.281 --> 00:06:42.375
So in roughly 100 years, the Roman Empire

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:44.082
went from persecuting Christians

00:06:44.082 --> 00:06:46.789
to making it the official religion

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:48.279
and actually going the other way,

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:52.470
starting to persecute some of
the pre-Christian religions

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:53.387
or rituals.

00:06:54.622 --> 00:06:56.436
The other thing that happens as we enter

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.853
into the fifth century now, as we go into

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:04.337
the fifth century, you have the capital

00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:09.928
of the Western Empire is
moved from Rome to Ravenna.

00:07:11.227 --> 00:07:14.214
With the idea, the
emperor see all of these

00:07:14.214 --> 00:07:16.873
Germanic tribes, they
feel threatened by them,

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:19.235
that Ravenna is easier to defend.

00:07:19.235 --> 00:07:22.457
It's surrounded by kind
of marshy, swampy area.

00:07:22.457 --> 00:07:25.459
The other thing of note about Theodosius,

00:07:25.459 --> 00:07:29.659
and as we move into
really the last century

00:07:29.659 --> 00:07:32.489
of the Western Roman Empire, is Theodosius

00:07:32.489 --> 00:07:36.445
was the last Roman Emperor
to rule all of Rome.

00:07:36.445 --> 00:07:39.154
After that, the East
and West are going to be

00:07:39.154 --> 00:07:40.994
ruled essentially independently.

00:07:40.994 --> 00:07:44.320
They're essentially going
to be separate empires.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.929
Then as we get into the fifth century,

00:07:46.929 --> 00:07:50.154
we already talked about
the Visigoths sacking Rome,

00:07:50.154 --> 00:07:52.904
then in 455, you have the Vandals

00:07:53.968 --> 00:07:56.248
which is another Germanic tribe that was

00:07:56.248 --> 00:07:58.718
similarly originally
pushed out by the Huns.

00:07:58.718 --> 00:08:01.289
You see them in blue right over here.

00:08:01.289 --> 00:08:03.132
They make it down the Iberian Peninsula

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:04.358
to North Africa.

00:08:04.358 --> 00:08:06.727
They eventually get to Carthage,

00:08:06.727 --> 00:08:09.340
and they become a little
bit of a naval power

00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:12.607
and they eventually are able to, in 455,

00:08:12.607 --> 00:08:14.550
sack Rome as well.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:18.383
So Rome is really taking
a hit multiple times.

00:08:19.339 --> 00:08:23.172
And then finally, the
end of the Roman Empire,

00:08:24.105 --> 00:08:26.681
or the Western Roman
Empire that most historians

00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:29.292
consider the end of the Roman Empire,

00:08:29.292 --> 00:08:32.875
is when the Germanic
ruler General Odoacer,

00:08:33.794 --> 00:08:35.791
or Odoacker depending
on how you pronounce it,

00:08:35.791 --> 00:08:39.411
is able to oust the emperor in Ravenna,

00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:41.489
and so then you have the official,

00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:45.656
and just to be clear, this
is, let me write Roman Empire,

00:08:48.263 --> 00:08:50.942
and so Odoacer is able to essentially

00:08:50.942 --> 00:08:53.694
end the Western Empire as we know it.

00:08:53.694 --> 00:08:55.165
And after that, the Western Empire

00:08:55.165 --> 00:08:56.945
becomes more and more fragmented

00:08:56.945 --> 00:08:59.780
into these kingdoms that are ruled by

00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:02.474
essentially Germanic
kings, and then we are now

00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:05.614
entering into the Middle Ages.

00:09:05.614 --> 00:09:07.262
Now the big question that historians

00:09:07.262 --> 00:09:08.603
have a lot of fun thinking about

00:09:08.603 --> 00:09:10.846
is why did all of this happen?

00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:12.849
Why did the Roman Empire fall?

00:09:12.849 --> 00:09:15.166
And before we even talk about why it fell,

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:16.952
we should give them a
little bit of credit.

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:18.475
Even in this video where I talk about

00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:20.228
the fall of the Roman Empire,

00:09:20.228 --> 00:09:23.336
I'm covering 300 years of history,

00:09:23.336 --> 00:09:25.470
and if you start with the
founding of the republic

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:30.340
until Odoacer takes over
Ravenna, ousts the emperor,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.425
we're talking 1,000 years.

00:09:32.425 --> 00:09:35.544
Most civilizations,
most empires don't last

00:09:35.544 --> 00:09:38.347
anywhere near that long.

00:09:38.347 --> 00:09:42.578
So to some degree, it's
surprising that it lasted so long.

00:09:42.578 --> 00:09:45.582
But in terms of the causes of its decline,

00:09:45.582 --> 00:09:47.948
we've talked about several
of them in this video.

00:09:47.948 --> 00:09:49.607
The empire got divided.

00:09:49.607 --> 00:09:52.106
The East and West stopped
viewing themselves

00:09:52.106 --> 00:09:54.065
so much as the same empire.

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:55.866
Trade sometimes broke down.

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:58.091
They didn't support each other militarily.

00:09:58.091 --> 00:10:00.407
The Eastern Empire was generally stronger,

00:10:00.407 --> 00:10:02.787
so it allowed invading tribes to focus

00:10:02.787 --> 00:10:05.156
on the weak point in the West.

00:10:05.156 --> 00:10:07.187
Some historians would
say that the Roman Empire

00:10:07.187 --> 00:10:09.503
stopped expanding, and
it needed that expansion

00:10:09.503 --> 00:10:12.085
in order to keep getting
more land and more slaves

00:10:12.085 --> 00:10:14.027
that really drove its economy.

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:17.335
One major factor probably was the Huns

00:10:17.335 --> 00:10:20.007
that caused this great
migration in the fourth

00:10:20.007 --> 00:10:22.878
and fifth centuries, it
caused the Germanic tribes

00:10:22.878 --> 00:10:25.813
to cross the Rhine and cross the Danube

00:10:25.813 --> 00:10:28.951
and become either settled as part

00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:32.461
of the Roman Empire or
threatened the Roman Empire.

00:10:32.461 --> 00:10:35.334
Another theory, and all of
these are probably contributors,

00:10:35.334 --> 00:10:37.454
is that as the Germanic tribes settled,

00:10:37.454 --> 00:10:39.901
they actually became more and more part of

00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:43.318
the Roman military, and some of them were

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.974
officially part of the military,

00:10:46.974 --> 00:10:49.618
some of them were mercenaries,
soldiers for fortune,

00:10:49.618 --> 00:10:52.081
paid soldiers, and so you
can imagine their allegiance

00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:54.175
to Rome was not as strong.

00:10:54.175 --> 00:10:57.124
Some folks say Christianity
may have been a factor.

00:10:57.124 --> 00:10:58.773
That the empire might have lasted,

00:10:58.773 --> 00:11:01.022
especially when people were doing

00:11:01.022 --> 00:11:03.318
what their traditional rites, rituals,

00:11:03.318 --> 00:11:05.668
they worshiped an emperor,
but now Christianity

00:11:05.668 --> 00:11:08.451
wasn't about worshiping
an emperor anymore.

00:11:08.451 --> 00:11:10.355
A lot of people think it's
corruption, instability,

00:11:10.355 --> 00:11:12.148
and we've talked a little bit about that.

00:11:12.148 --> 00:11:13.219
It could've been invasions, not just from

00:11:13.219 --> 00:11:14.901
the Germanic tribes and the Huns,

00:11:14.901 --> 00:11:18.094
but also the Sassanids on the East.

00:11:18.094 --> 00:11:21.207
So I'll leave you there,
and to think about,

00:11:21.207 --> 00:11:23.924
what was the cause or maybe what allowed

00:11:23.924 --> 00:11:26.866
the Roman Empire to survive for so long?
