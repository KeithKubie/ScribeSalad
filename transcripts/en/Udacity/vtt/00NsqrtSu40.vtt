00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.300
So another important thing that you can do with this representation

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.520
is recover the joint distribution. Remember a couple, a couple slides ago

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.790
we looked at the issue of how can we go from

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.260
the distrib, joint distribution to specifying

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.900
what the probabilities are, the conditional

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.210
probability tables, they're called, at each of these nodes. But we

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.350
can actually go the other direction as well. We can go from,

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.940
from the values in these conditional probabilities tables in each of

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.440
the nodes, to computing the probability

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.650
of any combination, any joint combination

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.610
of variables that we want. So, it turns out it's really, really

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.270
simple. We can just go and use these same ideas and say

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.700
the joint probability for some assignment to the variables, is equal to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.130
just the product of all the individual values. So the probability that that

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.950
value of A would be taken times the probability that that value

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.230
of B would be taken times the probability that that value of

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.070
C would be taken, conditioned on those are the values that were

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.540
chosen for A and B. So it's just like in the sampling case.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.840
&gt;&gt; Right, and

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.540
that's much more compact a representation.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.550
&gt;&gt; That's a good observation, yeah. So how, if

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.620
these were Boolean variables, how many values would we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.300
need to specify for the joint distribution in the

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.280
standard representation, where you just assign probability to everything.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.770
&gt;&gt; Well if I ignore the fact that there are some constraints that we might be

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.220
able to take advantage of, it would be

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.630
2 to the 5th, because there are five variables.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.260
&gt;&gt; Right, but here we've broken it down

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.770
into smaller chunks so, the probability of A,

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.420
it's just specified by single number. Probability of B is

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.500
specified by a single number. Probability of C is specified

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.480
for a single number for each combination of A and

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.190
B. That's four of them. This also requires four values and

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.730
this requires four values. So this is really, what, it's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.937
like 2 to the 5th minus 1 I guess. Because, if

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:38.017
I tell you the first 31 values, the last, the

00:01:38.017 --> 00:01:42.640
32th value, it's just 1 minus the sum of the other.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.738
This is 14 numbers versus 31. You are right, it is more compact, 31 is bigger.

00:01:49.738 --> 00:01:51.370
&gt;&gt; Right but let's imagine that all of the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.070
variables were in fact completely independent of one another,

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.240
then you would have 5, you would only need

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.440
5 numbers. It would be the product of the unconditionals.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.320
&gt;&gt; Yeah, which is what we'd get if we had kind of like just a

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.060
set of weighted coins. If they're unrelated to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.960
each other, but each one has some probability

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.030
of coming up heads, the probability of getting some, some particular

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.920
combination like, A is heads and B is tails and C

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.370
is heads and D is heads and E is heads. We

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.880
could just break that down to the probability of the individual events.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.310
&gt;&gt; So then all of the, just like with the joint distribution where

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.090
you have this exponential growth, because you need to know everything. Here you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.960
have the exponential growth that only depends upon the number of parents you

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.910
have. If you have no parents, then it is constant, if you have parents,

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.480
then is grows exponentially with the number of parents.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.620
&gt;&gt; Right, so the fewer number of parents,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.390
the more compact the distribution ends up being.
