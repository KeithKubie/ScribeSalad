00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:05.739
(intense music)

00:00:11.077 --> 00:00:12.412
 - Superheroes.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:13.880
We can't relate to 'em.

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:15.348 size:88% position:44%
 None of us can fly.

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:17.316 align:start position:0%
 So, Superman's like an alien
 from a different planet

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.651
to us, ya know?

00:00:18.684 --> 00:00:21.154 size:84% position:42%
  We've been lied to, okay?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:24.290 align:start position:0%
 What we need is a
 superhero that makes us all

00:00:24.323 --> 00:00:26.626 align:start size:88% position:13%
  feel like we could
  be superheroes.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.828 size:88% position:44%
  Enter, the de-constipator.

00:00:31.063 --> 00:00:32.198
 Right there.

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.268 align:start size:88% position:13%
You hear his superpower,
it's in his name.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:37.437
 See, I don't care what
 kinda bad guy you are.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.238
 I don't care how evil you are.

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:42.708 size:88% position:44%
  You're gonna stop whatever
  wrongdoings you're doing

00:00:42.741 --> 00:00:46.246 align:start size:88% position:13%
once the de-constipator
starts doo-dooing.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:52.952 size:88% position:44%
 - Thank you de-constipator.

00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:54.520
 - And what superhero
 is complete without an

00:00:54.553 --> 00:00:56.055
 arch nemesis?

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:59.459 size:84% position:42%
  Exactly, that's where the
  blackout baron comes in.

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.061 size:88% position:44%
 He has the power to
 sleep with anyone

00:01:02.094 --> 00:01:05.998
 as long as they're
 both blackout drunk.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:09.936 align:start position:0%
 Luckily, the de-constipator
 will stop at nothing

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:12.004 align:start position:0%
 until he gives the
 blackout baron the ultimate

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:12.939 size:88% position:44%
 booty call.

00:01:14.306 --> 00:01:15.708
So, what's your feeling on this?

00:01:15.741 --> 00:01:17.343 align:start position:0%
Are you thinking ya know,
Michael Bay blockbuster or maybe

00:01:17.376 --> 00:01:20.012
 Kathryn Bigelow awards sweep
 'cause I'm even considering

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:21.414
 like Netflix series.

00:01:21.447 --> 00:01:23.583 align:start size:88% position:13%
 - If I sent that
 script to any director

00:01:23.616 --> 00:01:26.919 align:start size:88% position:13%
about a superhero called
the de-constipator,

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:29.455
they'd use it to wipe their ass.

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:30.690
 - Better name.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:31.624
 I see what you're
 saying, better name.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:32.592 size:88% position:44%
 I'm with you on that, okay?

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:33.759
 - Call my assistant, alright?

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.661
 Better yet, fuck off, alright?

00:01:35.694 --> 00:01:36.796 size:84% position:42%
  Fuck off.

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.064
Good to see ya.

00:01:38.964 --> 00:01:41.000
 Anywhere, just go, hurry up.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:42.235
 - I think I sold that.

00:01:42.268 --> 00:01:43.303
 I think I fuckin' sold that.
