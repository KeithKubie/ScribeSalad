00:00:00.354 --> 00:00:02.520
What I want to do in this
video is talk a little bit

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.180
about quasars.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:14.180
And that's a short form for
quasi-stellar radio sources.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.490
And this name is
just a byproduct

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.646
of the first
observations of quasars.

00:00:20.646 --> 00:00:22.020
Because all they
looked like were

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.450
these kind of point-like sources
of electromagnetic radiation,

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.200
mainly in the radio
part of the spectrum.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.600
So that's why we called them
quasi-stellar radio sources.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100
Now, it turns out that they
are neither stars, or even

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.000
quasi-stellar.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.880
And actually, their
main energy isn't even

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.760
being released in
the radio band of

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.990
the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.180
They're far more
energetic than that.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:52.760
What they really are are the
active nucleuses of galaxies.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.950
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.934
So if we have a
supermassive black hole

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:58.350
at the center of
a galaxy-- so let

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.807
me draw that right over here.

00:01:00.807 --> 00:01:02.390
So that's our
supermassive black hole.

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.629
And maybe that's the
surface of the event horizon

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.070
of the supermassive black hole.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.190
The actual mass
of the black hole

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.160
is in the center of
that event horizon.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.314
If there is material that's
passing by this black hole,

00:01:14.314 --> 00:01:15.730
it's going to get
attracted to it.

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.020
And it's going to form an
accretion disk around it.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.590
This material is going
to start rotating

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:22.580
around this black hole.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.680
And some of it, if it
doesn't have enough velocity,

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.840
is going to actually
fall into the black hole.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.320
So you have all of this material
going around the black hole.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.060
And some of it, if it doesn't
have enough angular velocity

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.310
and not enough to orbit
around the black hole,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.300
it's actually going to fall in.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.216
Let me label this.

00:01:42.216 --> 00:01:43.340
This is the accretion disk.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.810
So as things are getting faster
and faster as they fall closer

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.590
and closer to this
black hole, and bumping

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.910
into each other more and more,
that gravitational potential

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.725
energy from things
falling into it

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:02.950
is being turned into actual
energy, actual temperature.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.170
And so what you
have is things start

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.600
to get really, unbelievably
hot near the surface.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.280
They get hotter and hotter as
they fall closer and closer

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.200
to that event horizon.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.140
And so near the
event horizon itself,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.670
things are so intense
that they're actually

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.100
releasing high-frequency
electromagnetic radiation,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.740
mainly in the X-ray
part of the spectrum.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.230
Now, I want to been very clear.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.730
So there's two things here.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.790
One is when you
learn about quasars,

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.060
or when I first was exposed to
quasars in like a Nova special,

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.940
they make you think that the
quasar, that the radiation is

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.230
somehow being released
by the black hole itself.

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.280
And I would scratch my
head because I was just

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.830
told that nothing can escape the
event horizon of a black hole,

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.410
including electromagnetic
radiation.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.176
So how could that be being
emitted by the black hole?

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:00.550
And the answer
is, it's not being

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.260
emitted by the black hole.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.710
It's being emitted by the matter
in the accretion disk that

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.720
hasn't quite gotten to
the event horizon yet.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.990
Once it's inside of
the event horizon,

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.450
any electromagnetic
radiation that it might emit

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.320
will not be able to escape
the black hole anymore,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.270
will not be able to escape
the actual event horizon.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.460
So all of this is from
the accretion disc

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.367
around the supermassive
black hole.

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:29.450
And the other question
that used to pop in my mind

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.210
is why does it come out at
these kind of perpendicular,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:40.100
orthogonal to the plane of
the actual accretion disk?

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.800
And at least my logic
tells me, well, things

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.370
aren't going to pop
out-- they're not

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.650
going to pop out along the
direction of the accretion disk

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.360
because then they're going to
be absorbed by other things.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.734
In fact, that's what's going
to cause other things to get

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:55.170
heated up closer to the
actual event horizon.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.840
So any energy that's going
out in that direction

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.100
is just going to be absorbed
and make other things hotter.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.860
And only when you go roughly
perpendicular to the plane

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:06.960
of the accretion
disk is that energy

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.115
allowed to kind of go and
transmit freely into space.

00:04:10.115 --> 00:04:11.710
Now, I want to be very clear.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.750
Quasars, these are the
most luminous things

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.555
that we know of in the universe.

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.220
The brightest-- or
actually, many quasars

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.260
are on the order of a
trillion suns in luminosity.

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.050
So they can be brighter
than an entire galaxy.

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:37.510
And that's just
coming from material

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.070
around a fairly small
region of space,

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:43.590
much, much, much smaller
than an actual galaxy.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.500
It's the very center.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.660
It's kind of just
the galactic core.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.680
Now another interesting
thing about quasars,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.960
and this kind of gives
credence to this notion

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.890
of a constantly
changing universe,

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.790
and even to some degree
the Big Bang itself,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.380
is you have these
supermassive black holes that

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:01.850
may be formed shortly
after the Big Bang.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.950
Now you can imagine, at an
early stage in the universe's

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:08.117
development there would
have been a lot of mass that

00:05:08.117 --> 00:05:10.700
would have been near these black
holes, that didn't have quite

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.710
the velocities to be
able to escape them or be

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.250
able to orbit around them.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:15.640
And so these would
actually start

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.920
falling into the black hole.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.780
And then over time,
all of the mass that

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:22.770
had to fall into the black hole,
into the supermassive black

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.450
hole, will have fallen into
the supermassive black hole.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.550
And if you imagine at some
future period of time,

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.820
you should still have the
supermassive black hole.

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.260
But all you should see is mostly
things orbiting around it.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:35.710
Anything that had
to fall into it,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.440
would have already
fallen into it.

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.400
So you're just going to see
things orbiting around it.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.062
And this is actually what
we see if we look around us.

00:05:43.062 --> 00:05:44.520
If we look at our
Milky Way Galaxy,

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.060
we don't observe a lot
of things falling in.

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.310
For example, the
Milky Way Galaxy

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.750
does not have an active
nucleus, an active core.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.760
It is not currently a quasar,
the center of the Milky Way

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.260
Galaxy.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.030
The supermassive black
hole there is not,

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.020
I guess we could say, digesting,
is not digesting or consuming

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.520
material.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.450
But you could imagine at some
point in the Milky Way's past,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:11.320
there might have been
a lot of material

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.160
that didn't have quite the
velocity to be able to orbit.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.360
And so that was consumed.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:21.520
And as it was consumed, it
would emit all of this X-ray

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.330
radiation and could be
observed as a quasar.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.870
And that's actually
what we observe.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.750
The closest quasars--
and we've observed

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:32.170
more than 200,000 quasars--
the closest quasars are

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:39.032
on the order of 780
million light years away.

00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:39.990
So what does that mean?

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:43.350
We don't observe quasars closer
than 700 million light years.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.260
So what that tells
us is, at least

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:49.730
in our region of the universe,
the most recent quasars

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.960
were 780 million
years in the past.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.750
When we look at closer parts
of the universe-- let me draw,

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.010
let's say this is the
observable universe.

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:01.100
This is us.

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.160
So we only start
to observe quasars

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.280
at a certain distance
away from us.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.750
And that distance
is actually also

00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:08.140
a certain time in the past.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.920
Because it took the light 780
million years to get to us.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.680
And actually, most
of the quasars

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.550
are more than 3 billion
light years away.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.380
Which tells us that they
only existed more than 3

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:22.430
billion years in the
past, at a younger

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.250
stage of the actual
universe, when there

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.810
was actual material for these
supermassive black holes

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:30.970
to consume at the
center of galaxies.

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.410
You move closer in time to
us, and most of that material

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.840
has actually been consumed.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.550
And we just have
material orbiting

00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:42.020
around these supermassive black
holes, which we call galaxies.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.009
And so we don't observe
quasars anymore.

00:07:45.009 --> 00:07:46.050
And just to give an idea.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.000
I mean these are, as everything
we learn in cosmology,

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.680
kind of these
mind-bending concepts,

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.100
unbelievable distances,
unbelievable masses,

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.020
unbelievable brightnesses, I
guess you could think about it.

00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:59.430
But just to give a sense,
the brightest quasars,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:02.600
the brightest known
quasars, devour

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:11.160
on the order of 1,000
solar masses per year.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:16.200
So that's on the order of 10
Earths, 10 Earths per second,

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.490
if I did my math right.

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:23.530
10 Earths per second
are being devoured

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:25.340
by the brightest quasars.

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:30.040
And it's that energy of that
mass that's acreting around it

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:32.595
that's generating
all of that energy.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:34.470
And actually, I should
say-- I shouldn't even

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.909
talk about it in
the present tense.

00:08:36.909 --> 00:08:38.200
This happened in the past.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.299
We're just observing it now.

00:08:40.299 --> 00:08:42.220
For all we know, the
rest of the universe

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.820
looks fairly similar to
the way our universe does.

00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.010
And so there really aren't
that many quasars around.

00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:49.550
Although the other side
of the coin might be,

00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:51.560
even though most of the
material has already

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:54.400
been consumed, maybe even by
our own supermassive black hole

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.260
in the center of the Milky Way,
at some point in the future,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.720
maybe it will be able to consume
on some more stellar material,

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.070
some more-- well, any type
of material in the future.

00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.070
And that might happen
about 4 or 5 billion years

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:10.690
in the future when we actually
collide with the Andromeda
