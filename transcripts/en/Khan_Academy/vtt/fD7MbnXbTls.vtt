00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.290
Let's say we have the
indefinite integral of 1

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:15.300
over 36 plus x squared d x.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.910
Now, as you can imagine, this
is not an easy integral to

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.830
solve without trigonometry.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.130
I can't do u substitution, I
don't have the derivative of

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.480
this thing sitting someplace.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.340
This would be easy if I
had a 2x sitting there.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.910
Than I would say, oh the
derivative of this is 2x,

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.470
I could do u substitution
and I'd be set.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.880
But there is no 2x there,
so how do I do it?

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.640
Well, I resort to our
trigonometric identities.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.100
Let's see what trig
identity we can get here.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.840
The first thing I always do,
this is just the way my brain

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.920
works, I always like it-- I can
see this is a constant plus

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.350
something squared, which
tells me I should use a

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.300
trigonometric identity.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.600
But I always like it in terms
of 1 plus something squared.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.210
I'm just going to rewrite my
integral as being equal to,

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.720
let me write the dx
in the numerator.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.870
This is just times dx.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.430
Let me write a nicer
integral than that.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:07.370
This is equal to the integral
of d x over 36 times 1

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.800
plus x squared over 36.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.130
1 plus x squared over 36,
that's another way to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.420
write my integral.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.110
Let's see if any of our trig
identities can somehow be

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.400
substituted in here for
that that would somehow

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.560
simplify the problem.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.190
So the one that springs to
mind, and if you don't know

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.430
this already, I'll write it
down right here, is 1 plus

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.630
tangent squared of theta.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.900
Let's prove this one.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.790
Tangent squared of theta, this
is equal to 1 plus just the

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.210
definition of tangent sine
squared of theta over

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.160
cosine squared of theta.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
Now 1 is just cosine squared
over cosine squared.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.250
So I can rewrite this as equal
to cosine squared of theta over

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.990
cosine squared of theta, that's
1, plus sine squared theta over

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.860
cosine squared of theta,
now that we have a

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.320
common denominator.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.490
Now what's cosine squared
plus sine squared?

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.970
Definition of the unit circle.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.210
That equals 1 over cosine
squared of theta.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.600
Or we could say that that
equals 1 over cosine squared.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.540
One over cosine is secant.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.090
So this is equal to the
secant squared of theta.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.270
If we make the substitution, if
we say let's make this thing

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.340
right here equal to tangent of
theta, or tangent

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.590
squared of theta.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.310
Then this expression will be 1
plus tangent squared of theta.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.700
Which is equal to
secant squared.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.860
Maybe that'll help simplify
this equation a bit.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:50.080
We're going to say that x
squared over 36 is equal to

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.710
tangent squared of theta.

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.440
Let's take the square root of
both sides of this equation and

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:04.090
you get x over 6 is equal to
the tangent of theta, or that x

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.540
is equal to 6 tangent of theta.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.950
If we take the derivative of
both sides of this with respect

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.140
to theta we get d x d theta is
equal to-- what's the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.610
derivative of the
tangent of theta?

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.120
I could show it to you just
by going from these basic

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.070
principles right here.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.670
Actually let me do it
for you just in case.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.000
So the derivative of tangent
theta-- never hurts to do it

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.140
on the side, let me
do it right here.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.470
It's going to be 6 times the
derivative with respect to

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.490
theta of tangent of theta.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.050
Which we need to figure,
so let's figure it out.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.040
The derivative of tangent of
theta, that's the same thing

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.030
as d d theta of sine of
theta over cosine of theta.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.270
That's just the
derivative of tangent.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.380
Or this is just the same thing
as the derivative with respect

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.520
to theta, let me scroll to
the right a little bit.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.650
Because I never remember the
quotient rule, I've told you in

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.090
the past that it's somewhat
lame, of sine of theta times

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.560
cosine of theta to
the minus 1 power.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.860
What is this equal to?

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.090
We could say it's equal to,
well the derivative of the

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.520
first expression or the first
function we could say, which

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.050
is just cosine of theta.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.760
This is equal to cosine of
theta, that's just the

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.050
derivative of sine of theta
times our second expression.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.660
Times cosine of theta
to the minus 1.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.810
I've put these parentheses, and
put the minus 1 out there

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.610
because I didn't want to put
the minus 1 here and make you

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.590
think that I'm talking about an
inverse cosine or an arccosine.

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.680
So that's the derivative of
sine times cosine and now I

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.690
want to take plus the
derivative of cosine.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.770
Not just cosine, the derivative
if cosine to the minus 1.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.710
So that is minus 1 times cosine
to the minus 2 power of theta.

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.466
That's the derivative of
the outside times the

00:05:01.466 --> 00:05:03.110
derivative of the inside.

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.060
Let me scroll over more.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.620
So that's the derivative
of the outside.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.160
If the cosine theta was just an
x, you would say x to the minus

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360
1 derivative is minus
1 x to the minus 2.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.560
Now times the derivative
of the inside.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.230
Of cosine of theta with
respect to theta.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.180
So that's times minus
sine of theta.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.350
I'm going to multiply all of
that times sine of theta.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.690
The derivative of this thing,
which is the stuff in green,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:30.550
times the first expression.

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.520
So what does this equal?

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.890
These cosine of theta
divided by cosine of

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:36.960
theta, that is equal to 1.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.400
And then I have a minus 1 and
I have a minus sine of theta.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.670
That's plus plus.

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:43.190
What do I have?

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.910
I have sine squared, sine of
theta time sine of theta

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:47.980
over cosine squared.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:54.430
So plus sine squares of theta
over cosine squared of theta.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.570
Which is equal to 1 plus
tangent squared of theta.

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.290
What's 1 plus tangent
squared of theta?

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.980
I just showed you that.

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.720
That's equal to secant
squared of theta.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.100
So the derivative of tangent
of theta is equal to

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.410
secant squared of theta.

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:11.940
All that work to get us
fairly something-- it's nice

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.490
when it comes out simple.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.440
So d x d theta, this is
just equal to secant

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.780
squared of theta.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.440
If we want to figure out what d
x is equal to, d x is equal to

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.510
just both sides times d theta.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:32.680
So it's 6 times secant
squared theta d theta.

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.290
That's our d x.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.330
Of course, in the future
we're going to have to back

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.780
substitute, so we want
to solve for theta.

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.000
That's fairly straightforward.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.600
Just take the arctangent of
both sides of this equation.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:50.270
You get that the arctangent of
x over 6 is equal to the theta.

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.600
We'll save this for later.

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.640
So what is our
integral reduced to?

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.020
Our integral now becomes
the integral of d x?

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.210
What's d x?

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:06.430
It is 6 secant squared
theta d theta.

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.860
All of that over this
denominator, which is 36

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:19.380
times 1 plus tangent
squared of theta.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.600
We know that this right there
is secant squared of theta.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.420
I've shown you that
multiple times.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.470
So this is secant squared of
theta in the denominator.

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:31.370
We have a secant squared on the
numerator, they cancel out.

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:32.990
So those cancel out.

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.400
So are integral reduces to,
lucky for us, 6/36 which

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.910
is just 1/6 d theta.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.760
Which is equal to
1/6 theta plus c.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.650
Now we back substitute
using this result.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.240
Theta is equal to
arctangent x over 6.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.710
The anti-derivative 1 over
36 plus x squared is

00:07:55.710 --> 00:07:58.220
equal to 1/6 times theta.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:06.210
Theta's just equal to the
arctangent x over 6 plus c.

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:07.000
And we're done.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.770
So that one wasn't too bad.
