00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.325
I want to illustrate one more thing with our, somewhat silly, I guess, really

00:00:04.325 --> 00:00:08.355
silly example which allows us to get even more reuse, which is our real goal

00:00:08.355 --> 00:00:12.746
with inheritance. So, both the GrizzlyBear and the BlackBear classes have chase

00:00:12.746 --> 00:00:16.942
methods. And what these methods do is pretty similar. If the victim is up the

00:00:16.942 --> 00:00:20.695
tree. They do something different. The GrizzlyBear knocks down the tree, the

00:00:20.695 --> 00:00:25.202
BlackBear climbs the tree. Otherwise, they do the same thing. So, we'd really

00:00:25.202 --> 00:00:30.012
like to reuse almost all of this code and assuming there's chase people too and

00:00:30.012 --> 00:00:34.600
what we'd really like to do is move the shared parts of the chase method into

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.114
Bear and only deal with the special case, where the victim's up the tree in

00:00:39.114 --> 00:00:43.841
GrizzlyBear and BlackBear. Here's one way we might deal with this, which is to

00:00:43.841 --> 00:00:48.566
use the built in isinstance operator. And this returns true if the object is an

00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:53.023
instance of the class or one of its supertypes. Otherwise, it returns false.
