00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.630
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.190
&gt;&gt; Mary-Jane Deeb: Good
afternoon everyone.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:27.450
And thank you for coming.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.800
And thank you for being here in the
African Middle East Reading Room

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.580
where we are holding, I believe
it's our 27th Conversations

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.830
with African Poets and Writers.

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.590
I'm Mary-Jane Deeb,
chief of the division.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.570
And I am going to say a few
words about our division,

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.370
which is responsible for the
connections for 78 countries

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.090
in Africa, central Asia, the
Caucuses, and the Middle East.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:11.720 position:56%
We want to invite you to come and
use our collections, read our books,

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.650
and follow us on Facebook,
and read our blogs.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:25.350
Because all this is a way of us
sharing with you the treasures

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.760
that we have here at
the Library of Congress

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.730
and in the African
Middle East Division.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.660 position:56%
The Conversations with African Poets

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.210
and Writers was established
here about five years ago.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.050
And although it started
with an original event more

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.500
than eight years ago when we
had the great writer, Achebe --

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.690
Chinue Achebe -- who
was here with us.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.850
We also had Ali Mazrui, who
actually launched the series.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.720 position:56%
But since then we've had about six
programs a year, three in the spring

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.910
and three in the fall
roughly speaking.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:16.130 position:56%
And we've done that with the Poetry
and Literature Center at the Library

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.190
that has been established
for a very long time,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.780
that holds the poet laureate of the
United States, that brings in poets

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.620 position:56%
and writers from all over the world.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.480
And the Poetry Center
co-sponsors this program.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.550
We are also co-sponsoring
this program from the onset

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.940
with the African Society of
the National Summit on Africa,

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.440
which is the largest
educational institution focusing

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.720
on Africa throughout
the United States.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.430
It's an NGO.

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:08.000
And today we are going to also
inaugurate formally our partnership

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.510
with Howard University and with --

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.250
[ Applause ]

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.680
-- who is so well represented by
Professor Mbye Cham, a writer,

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.260
author, film editor, and a
multifaceted and Renaissance man

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:39.760
who is also joining us in this
partnership on the collection --

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.580
on our Conversations with
African Poets and Writers.

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.650
And now having said that,
I would like to invite him

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.170
to say a few words
about Howard University

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.660
and about himself and this program.

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.340
Thank you.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.640
&gt;&gt; Mbye Cham: Thank you, Mary Jane.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.630
Good afternoon.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:59.930
It's a pleasure.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.060
We are really thrilled and
honored to be officially a partner

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.870
in this very important series here.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:18.430
And this partnership really builds
on a history of strong relationship

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.520
between Howard University
the Library of Congress,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.140
particularly the Middle East
Center and African Division.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:35.410
We are very happy at the
Center for African Studies.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.820
It's a new centrally funded
Title VI national resource center

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.340
for African studies.

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:48.030
At Howard University
we had a grant in 2014.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.640
And the center basically functions
as a hub to coordinate all

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.810
of the Africa-related research,
teaching, and creative work going

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.730
on at Howard, which is
practically really every school

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.710
and every college in
Africa there's some kind

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:13.590
of activity going there
related to Africa.

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.890
And the center also does a
lot of promotion and teaching

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:25.880
of African languages and promoting
also African area studies courses.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.210
And one of the important components

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.500
of the center is a very robust
outreach program that we have also

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.290
to K-12, community colleges,
minority-serving institutions,

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.720
HBCU's, and four-year colleges.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:48.050
And this is something that
we take very seriously.

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:51.650
It's another avenue,
outlet for us to partner

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.920
with different institutions,
particularly in the area

00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:01.690
to really promote different
portraits, different images,

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.420
different more enabling kind
of understandings of Africa.

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:11.390
And we're very happy to be part
of this very important series

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:17.020
that we think is one that
contributes very much

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.080
to creating these different kinds
of understandings of Africa.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.060
And we're particularly
happy to welcome our guest,

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.580
who will be introduced shortly.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:38.220
But just to say thank you very
much for providing us the honor,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:45.440
Mary Jane, Patricia, African
Society, to be partners with you

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.030
in this important series here.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:48.830
Thank you very much.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.990
[ Applause ]

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.460
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Good afternoon.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.650
Welcome to the Conversations
with African Poets and Writers.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:04.730
We are honored this afternoon
to be with Mr. Abubakar Ibrahim,

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:10.990 position:56%
an accomplished African writer and
author and a fine example of what we

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.830
like to call shattering
stereotypes and perceptions

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.570
about a lack of African literature.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:17.950
Africa writes.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:20.730 position:56%
And so because we have an expression

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:24.120
at the Africa Society Africa
matters, and so we encourage you

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.900
to read African literature.

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.210
And this exemplifies
the work that we do.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.080
We engage and educate
Americans about Africa so as

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:36.070
to create a better understanding of
the continent's peoples, cultures,

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.600
economies, and accomplishments.

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:42.970
So let's talk a little
bit about Mr. Ibrahim.

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:46.910
Abubakar Adam Ibrahim
was born in Jos, Nigeria.

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.610
Growing up he always had an
intrinsic desire to write and,

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.470
encouraged by his brother,
he did just that.

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:57.960
He has written exceptional
pieces of literature.

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.470
His debut collection of short
stories, <i>The Whispering Trees</i>,

00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:07.280
was listed for the Etisalat
Prize for Literature in 2014

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.130
with a title story
that was short-listed

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.880 position:56%
for Caine Prize for African writing.

00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:18.090
His debut novel, <i>Season of Crimson
Blossom</i>, was published in the UK

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:23.060
by Cassava Republic Press and
tells the captivating story

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:27.520 position:56%
of an elicit affair between a devout
55-year-old widow and grandmother

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.460
and a street gang leader.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:33.160
It takes place in a
conservative Muslim community

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:39.230
in northern Nigeria, set against
the backdrop of political unrest.

00:08:39.230 --> 00:08:43.960
But Mr. Ibrahim has been the
recipient and has won many awards

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:48.160
and accolades, including a BBC
African Prize among other awards,

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:57.140
and a Gabriel Garcia Marquez fellow
and a -- just a second here --

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.400
Civitella Ranieri fellow.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:03.440
He was also named in 2014 at
the Hay Festival Africa 39 list

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.090
of the most promising
writers under the age of 40

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.870
who have defined the
future of African writing.

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:12.420
And I'm sure you will
see that shortly.

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.780
He's also the recipient of
the 2016 Goethe-Institut

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:19.630
and Sylt Foundation
African Residency Award.

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:24.650
And I was also able to get
for your own information --

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:27.870
I asked him to tell me
something that's not

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:29.560
in here, share with us a hobby.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.030
And he says to me that he
enjoys watching only Barcelona.

00:09:33.030 --> 00:09:34.560
So.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.790
[ Laughter ]

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:40.510 position:56%
So join me in welcoming Mr. Ibrahim.

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:45.500
[ Applause ]

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.860
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Hello.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.480
Good afternoon.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.800
I'm delighted to be here after
Patricia somehow contrived

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:02.550
to extract [inaudible] vital
piece of information from me.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.220
It is a pleasure being here.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:11.750
[Inaudible] wonderful people in
the audience to listen to me read.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:16.140
I've been told I'm supposed
to read for 15, 20 minutes.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:22.680
So I don't have much time,
so I must get onto it.

00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:27.590
So like Patricia said, the book is
principally about the relationship

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:33.640
between a 55-year-old widow
and a street gang leader

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:36.330
who is 30 years younger than her.

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:43.970
And it's set against the backdrop
of [inaudible] in northern Nigeria.

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:46.010
So the first section
I'm going to read talks

00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:49.070
about a character whose
name is Fa'iza.

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:53.110 position:56%
She's 15. But she's been
traumatized by some of the tensions,

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:56.320
but no one really understands
what she's going through.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.470
But this is what happened to her.

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:12.140
So that November morning, she knew
she wanted to be by his side --

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.830
by her father's side --
when the news reached them.

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.020
He had returned from the
dawn prayers and was hoping

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:20.920
to catch the results of the
previous day's elections

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.220
on the BBC Hausa Service.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:26.920
He had just turned on
his shortwave radio

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:30.550
when a neighbor, Umaru
Sanda, barged in.

00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:35.030
"What are you still doing here
when the whole town has gone gaga?"

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:38.550
But because not even Umaru Sanda's
dimwit wife paid much attention

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:43.090
to Umaru Sanda, her father
hadn't taken any notice.

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.620
How could there be another riot

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:48.610
when so many policemen had been
deployed for the elections?

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:52.060
But the sounds of gunshots drawing
ever closer vindicated Sanda,

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:56.550
who had since left to
evacuate his family.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.090
Because they had lived through
riots in 2001, 2002, and 2004,

00:12:01.090 --> 00:12:05.150
they knew their neighborhood
was not safe.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.470
Their likes were far outnumbered.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.870
So Mua'zu started packing up
valuables, and Jamilu tried

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:13.270
to roll the mattress off the bed.

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:17.580
Amina clung to her mother's
wrapper, both were crying.

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.150
Gunshots thundered close by.

00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:22.960
Then the banshee screams of
Umaru Sanda's wife leapt at them

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:28.380
from across the fence and
shredded, with decided finality,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.060
any hope they had of the unfolding
nightmare ending before it

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.040
fully manifested.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.340
"Where is he?

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.640
Where is he?"

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:40.930
There was a heavy bang on the door.

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:43.980
Amidst so much screaming
and so many enraged voices,

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:46.740
no one could be certain
what was happening.

00:12:46.740 --> 00:12:48.260
Mua'zu snapped out
of his stupor first.

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:51.890
"The bathroom, quick."

00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.370
It was the sound of desperation

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:57.360
in her father's voice
that struck Fa'iza.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:58.960
And when she tried
to look into his eyes

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.370
for some reassurance,
he turned his face away.

00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:07.060
They crammed into the bathroom, all
five of them, and locked the door.

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:11.570 position:56%
In the small space, they waited,
like the cows Fa'iza had seen packed

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.030
into open trucks at
the Yan Awaki market

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.520
on their way to the slaughterhouse.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.210
The smell of overnight piss
still waiting to be flushed

00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:22.050
in the toilet bowl swelled.

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:27.780
But above it the raw stench of
fear made Fa'iza's head turn.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.300
She wanted to bend down
but bumped into Jamilu.

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.700
"Watch it."

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.270
It was a whisper.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:38.370
"Shush." Even in that
whispered word,

00:13:38.370 --> 00:13:41.480
there was anxiety in
her father's voice.

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.330
Amina began whimpering and would
have started wailing but for Asabe,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:48.770
who held her tightly, hushing her
and suppressing her own cries.

00:13:48.770 --> 00:13:51.730
"Keep her quiet."

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.140
Now there was anger
in Mua'zu's voice.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:57.350
Asabe held the girl and
clasped a hand over her mouth.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:58.850 position:56%
Then she herself started whimpering,

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.210
her steady drone filling
the silence.

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:06.050
Jamilu wriggled his way to the top
of the toilet bowel and squatted,

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:07.720
resting his weight on his legs.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.440
Fa'iza heaved and wriggled into
the little space her brother

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.870
had vacated.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.320 position:56%
When they heard the front door being
bashed in, Asabe's stomach rumbled

00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.180
like a disgruntled volcano.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.090
"I want to use the toilet."

00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:24.200
Jamilu's foot slipped and he
hurtled into his father's back.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.090
They crashed into the door.

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.010
The commotion outside
blanketed the noise

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:31.420
and they waited, holding
their breath.

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.340
"Ayatul Qursiy," Mua'zu ordered.

00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.240
Fa'iza mechanically started
reciting the verse from memory.

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:39.580
"In the toilet?"

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.370
Jamilu was incredulous.

00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:43.790
"In your hearts."

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:46.360
But they froze as they heard
the doors being broken down

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.470
and furniture overturned;
the crash of the TV

00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:51.450
and the splintering of glass.

00:14:51.450 --> 00:14:55.740
Some maniac hacked at the wall with
a machete, the angry sound of metal

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.940
on concrete and his hate-filled
scream jarring Fa'iza's nerves.

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:03.560
The warm smell of shit
bloated and filled the room.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:07.750
Fa'iza turned to her mother and
saw her mouth moving mindlessly,

00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:11.430
her face, in the dim light,
glistening with tears and sweat.

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:17.140
Fa'iza felt a hand searching for
hers and knew it was her father.

00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:20.260
He squeezed it and quickly let go.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.540
But she still sensed the trembling.

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.340
When they broke down the bathroom
door, her father went first,

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:28.670
hands raised above his head.

00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:33.370 position:56%
Fa'iza felt a warm liquid run down
her thighs and pool around her feet.

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:34.670
"Spare my children, please."

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:40.330
Mua'zu knelt down before the armed
mob that had invaded the house.

00:15:40.330 --> 00:15:41.630
"Kill him.

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:45.500 position:56%
Kill him. What are you waiting for?"

00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:46.880
It was a woman.

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:49.870
Fa'iza knew then that she
would never forget the voice

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.170
of that woman.

00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:53.550
She would never forget
the hate in it.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:57.110
She perceived the contagious
nature of hate that makes one want

00:15:57.110 --> 00:15:59.430
to murder people they have
never interacted with.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:03.680
Or people with whom they have
eaten from the same bowl,

00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:06.350
mourned alongside and
shared laughter,

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.170
people with whom they have nurtured
the verdant canopy of a friendship

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.760
that was on occasions
closer to kinship.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:18.670
But that woman's voice, in
one sweep, ripped that canopy,

00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:20.950
letting the pieces fall heavily,

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:24.200
like shredded foliage
around their feet.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.650
Fa'iza stepped forward and
saw the face of Jacob James,

00:16:27.650 --> 00:16:31.620
her math teacher, who
always dressed smartly --

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.820
his shirt ironed and tucked
in with a neatly knotted tie.

00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:38.090
The students made fun
of his sturdy brogues

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.330
because they had never seen
him wear any other shoes.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:44.040
He always smiled at their jokes.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.870
But that morning, he
was not smiling.

00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:51.100
His face, made fierce by war paint,
glistened with sweat and opium

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.540
as he raised his machete
and brought it down.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.250
Bright, red blood, warm and sticky,
splashed across Fa'iza's face

00:17:01.250 --> 00:17:05.090
and dotted, in a fine spray,
the shell-pink night dress

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.390
that her father had bought her.

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.870
So that was the first
section I'm going to read.

00:17:15.030 --> 00:17:19.740
I have an aversion for
depicting violence in my works,

00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:23.990
but because there's a lot of
violence going on in Nigeria

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:26.370
as a whole and in the
north especially,

00:17:26.370 --> 00:17:30.660
it kind of forms an important
background to the story.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:36.180
So I'm going to read a
different section now.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.380
Like I said, at the heart of
the story there's this affair

00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:47.080
between a 55-year-old woman who
is a devout Muslim, a mother,

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.180 position:56%
and a grandmother with a gang leader
who is 30 years younger than her.

00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.140
So in spite of this violence going
on, people still live or attempt

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.040
to live as normally as they can.

00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:00.350
And it can't stop people
from falling in love,

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:05.670
from having relationships,
even in refugee camps.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.870
So this is an encounter between
Binta, who is the main character

00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:14.100
in the novel, and her
lover, Hausa Reza.

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.170
She drifted, almost weightlessly,
in the pungent smell of weed.

00:18:19.170 --> 00:18:22.400
It was only when she opened her
eyes and saw him sitting shirtless

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.460
by the window, puffing
on the joint in his hand,

00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:27.970
that she realized where she was.

00:18:27.970 --> 00:18:30.390
Binta stretched and yawned.

00:18:30.390 --> 00:18:34.110
"Hassan, stop smoking that thing
in here, you could get arrested.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.860 position:56%
Besides, it's giving me a headache."

00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:39.950
With his back turned to her,
she could not see his face.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:43.980
She propped herself up on
her elbow and remembered

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.480
that she was naked under the sheet.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.390
Her clothes were on the
chair across the room.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:51.350
She had taken them off
one after the other

00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:55.780
and folded them carefully
while he had waited on the bed.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.200
"Just action."

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.940
She smiled at the now familiar
tingling that thawed her incise

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:02.840
as she did up the hook of her bra.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:07.170
"You must have been on something."

00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:13.140
He turned to her and smiled and
she saw how handsome he looked,

00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.030
how his glazed eyes
seemed so peaceful and

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.880
yet so far away, how
young he really was.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.690
"Action zalla."

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:26.260
He raised a joint at her before
putting it back to his lips.

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.820
He looked at her, then
turned back to the window

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.960
and watched the sprinklers
watering the lawn.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.260
"God, what am I doing?"

00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:38.620
Her voice was low because
she was addressing herself.

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.590
"What?" "I don't know.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.890
You are so young, Hassan.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.190
I don't know if this is right."

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:48.070
"Why must it be right?"

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:52.640 position:56%
He spoke with a timber in his voice,
the one she had come to associate

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.240
with what she had called
his inner self:

00:19:55.240 --> 00:20:00.020
The dreamy-eyed philosopher
awakened by ganja fumes.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:02.390
"Why must anything
be right or wrong?

00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:06.480
Why can't things be
just the way they are?"

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.780
She sighed.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.250
"When you smoke this thing, I
don't know what it does to you,

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.670
you just talk rubbish sometimes."

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.990
He smiled and put the
joint to his lips.

00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:18.160
"Maybe you should try it."

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.640
"God forbid.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.950
I want you to quit,
it's killing you."

00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:24.250
He shrugged.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:25.930
"What doesn't?

00:20:25.930 --> 00:20:27.980
I will die when I die.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.810
We all will, you understand?"

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:33.130
Binta sighed again.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:37.820
"My daughter was saying
something earlier today,

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.480
about some stupid flower that
waits a lifetime to bloom.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.780
Thirty years, she said.

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:47.630
And when it, after all those
years, it smells like a corpse."

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.920
"Ha ha. What sort of
flower is that?"

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:55.340
"I was just thinking how
much like that flower I am.

00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:01.210 position:56%
I have waited my whole life to feel
as I do when I'm with you, you know?

00:21:01.210 --> 00:21:03.450
I shouldn't be telling you
such things, but I just need

00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:06.150
to get it off my chest, you know?

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:08.970
No one has ever made
me feel this way.

00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.310
But like that flower, after
all those years waiting,

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:15.610 position:56%
when I bloom, it doesn't feel right.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.700
I don't know if you understand me."

00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:21.910
He continued to puff on the joint,
looking disturbingly peaceful.

00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:25.910
"You mean it stinks."

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:28.690
She surprised herself
with her laughter.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:29.990
It rocked her.

00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:33.330
She laughed for a while,
sniffling as she did.

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:35.780
When she managed to stop,
she wiped away the tears

00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.640
from the corners of her eyes.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.600
But they wouldn't stop, even
after she no longer felt amused.

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.930
That was how she knew
she was actually crying.

00:21:43.930 --> 00:21:48.520
Save the occasional movements
of his hands to guide the joint

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.210
to his lips, he kept still,

00:21:51.210 --> 00:21:54.270
as if reading the cipher
in the curling fumes.

00:21:54.270 --> 00:21:56.870
It took him a while to speak.

00:21:56.870 --> 00:22:01.140
"You know, when I was a young
boy, there was this Eid day,

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:05.480
and we were so excited
with our new clothes.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.170
There was this cheap brocade
our father brought for us,

00:22:08.170 --> 00:22:14.500
it was called Shonekan, it was kind
of in vogue then, you understand."

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.800
She knew it; she had bought it
for her children, too, around '93.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.220
It had been a fallout from
the political campaigns

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.750
when the borders had been
opened to cheap commodities

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:28.890
that politicians had
used to entice voters.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:32.620
All sorts of things had
come in: Salt, sugar,

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:35.650
strange soaps with too much
soda that scalded the hands

00:22:35.650 --> 00:22:38.150
and bleached clothes,
cheap shiny fabrics

00:22:38.150 --> 00:22:41.230
that colored the water
they were to be washed in;

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:45.260
petrol with blue, pink,
and green hues.

00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.820
But the elections had been
annulled when the military decided

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.810
against handing over
to the civilians.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:54.920
Instead Shonekan was put in
charge until he was upended

00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.320
in a palace coup not long after.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.220
His name was given to all
the strange commodities

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.840
that traders had hoarded
from the political campaigns

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:10.040
and which flooded the markets as
soon as the politicking was over.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:13.720
"Mine was white, sparkling
and starched.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.230
We had just returned from the Eid
and I was going to take it off

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:21.710
so I wouldn't stain it while I
ate rice and stew, you understand?

00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.820
Then Aminu, my little
brother; my half-brother,

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.450
accidentally spilled ink on it."

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:33.580
He smoked his joint until she
realized he had finished his story.

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.940
When he turned to her
and saw a perplexed face,

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:37.240
he smiled with glazed eyes.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.580
"We are like clothes,
you understand.

00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.280
We get rumpled and creased and
torn, sometimes irreparably.

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:49.170
Some of us are stitched
up, patched up.

00:23:49.170 --> 00:23:51.360
Others are discarded.

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.970
Some clothes are fortunate.

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:54.700
Others are not.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.990
They are born into
misfortune and ink spills

00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:00.070
and whatnots, you understand?"

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:03.890
She rolled her eyes, chasing
the meaning of what he had said.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:07.250
"Hassan Reza, you are high."

00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:09.530
He raised the stub in his
hand in acknowledgement

00:24:09.530 --> 00:24:12.490
and took one long last drag.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:15.180
"You really need to
give up these things.

00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.670
Be a good man, for God's sake."

00:24:17.670 --> 00:24:20.040
"I am what I am."

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:22.190
He crushed the stub in the
ashtray and turned to her.

00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:28.570
"And what about that issue,
about going back to school?"

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:31.330
He wagged a finger
in front of his face.

00:24:31.330 --> 00:24:34.540
"No talk, just action,
you understand."

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:36.160
"Seriously, Hassan."

00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:38.660
"No, not now, please.

00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:41.150
I have an important
assignment from my boss.

00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:42.830
Maybe after that."

00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:44.450
"What assignment?"

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.720
"Very important, you understand.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:49.520
Very important."

00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.870
So that is the second
section of the reading.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:25:05.610
Lastly, I'll read -- so
the whole of this story,

00:25:05.610 --> 00:25:09.330
this relationship takes place
in a very [inaudible] community.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:12.790
It's a very close society
where everyone sort

00:25:12.790 --> 00:25:15.220
of knows what everyone is doing.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.900
So eventually this affair
between Binta and Reza is exposed.

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:27.430
And this is what happened when
some women found out about it.

00:25:29.930 --> 00:25:32.180
Following the incident at Laraba's,

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.050
thoughts of entirely
forfeiting her studies

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.420
at the madrasa had
crossed her mind overnight.

00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:40.510
But realizing that her silence
would have encouraged these rumors,

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:44.490
burying her in shame, Binta
decided to face her accusers and,

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:47.990
before it grew any worse,
put an end to their malice.

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:49.630
She was still thinking
of the shari'ah's ruling

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:52.600
on falsely accusing
decent women of depravity

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.540
when she reached the madrasa
and found two groups of women.

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.370
One was huddled around Mariya while
she tried to interest them in wares

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:05.750
from the huge bag beneath her desk;
make-up kits, perfumes from Arabia,

00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:10.020
henna from India, bottled
honey and the usual variety

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:12.480
of sex boosters and creams.

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:16.150 position:56%
Another group had formed at the
back, clustered around Mallama Umma,

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.790
going over the previous lessons
under the guidance of the matron.

00:26:19.790 --> 00:26:24.600
Ustaz Nura was not in class,
neither was his wife, Murja.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:29.040
Binta was enthralled by some
of the wares on Mariya's desk

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:30.340 position:56%
and reached for a jar of pure honey.

00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:35.050
When she asked if it was definitely
pure, Mariya scowled at her.

00:26:35.050 --> 00:26:39.560
"Well, it isn't adulterated,
if that's what you mean."

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.500
The other women turned to her.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.860
Binta felt cowed by the attention.

00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:48.220
"Well, you know, sometimes
people do add sugar."

00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:51.120
"Binta, keep [inaudible]
if you are not buying.

00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:53.520
Who are you to come
here with accusations?

00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:58.150
Imagine the hyena calling the
dog a savage," Mariya hissed.

00:26:58.150 --> 00:27:03.600
That wasn't how Binta imagined
the scenario would play out,

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.480
and before she could
marshal her thoughts, Ladidi,

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.510
the skinny woman famed for
her half-dozen divorces

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:12.380
and her children fathered
by as many men,

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.530
waved her hand before her
nose and cleared her throat.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:18.220
"What is that God-awful smell?"

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:21.990
The women sniffed the air and,

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.420
having failed to perceive
it, they turned to Ladidi.

00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:29.720
After an appropriate interval, in
which Ladidi savored the attention,

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:36.320
she made a declaration that
stunned the entire class,

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:38.110
including Mallama Umma's
earnest group devoted

00:27:38.110 --> 00:27:40.980
to the study of hadith at the rear.

00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.200
"It's the smell of zina, wallahi.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.520
I could perceive it from anywhere.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.060
There is a fornicator
in this class."

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:53.270
And she spat and turned
her back to the slimy mucus

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:56.590
that slid sordidly down the wall.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.920
"Who are you calling
a fornicator, Ladidi?

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:01.360
Are you making false
accusations against me?

00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:04.420
Can you prove anything?"

00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.720
Ladidi chuckled.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.490
"Who mentioned your name?"

00:28:08.490 --> 00:28:09.900
she hissed.

00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:13.090 position:56%
"But did they not say a guilty
person would sweat even in the rain?

00:28:13.090 --> 00:28:16.160
Aikin banza."

00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.030
Binta put down the bottle
of honey on the table and,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:20.860
in the heavy silence that followed,

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.020
walked to her seat in
the middle of class.

00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.850
She sat down and bowed her head.

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:31.240
But then Shafa'atu, the young bride
who was stationed just behind her

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:33.550
and was queasy already with
the burgeoning seed inside her,

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:38.220
got up abruptly and knocked
over her bag in the process.

00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.990
She gathered her books from
the floor and, holding her hand

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:44.500
over her mouth, hurried
out of the class.

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.200
Ladidi Hassan adjusted her
hijab, spat on the floor,

00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:53.210
cast a sidelong glance at Binta,
whose head was still bowed,

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:55.750
and walked out of the class.

00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:57.960
Two other women followed her.

00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:59.750
And then Mallama Umma
resumed her tutorials

00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:03.600
with her voice made unnecessarily
loud as to take in the entire class

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:07.610
and with the fervor that was
driven by restrained furry.

00:29:07.610 --> 00:29:11.070
Binta could hear her, but
she was not listening.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:13.370
The words cascaded off her
consciousness and registered only

00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.220
in the background of her thoughts.

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.710
Her mind was numbed by the
recollection of the silence

00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:21.360
that had accompanied
her to her seat.

00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:26.250
Her vision was blurred by the film
of tears that lingered in her eyes

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:29.100
because she would not let
them run down her cheeks.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:33.070
She had no idea how long she
sat like that: Head bowed,

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:37.890
tears imprisoned in her eyes, and
a whistling silence in her mind.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:39.580
When she stood up,
she became conscious

00:29:39.580 --> 00:29:42.170
of the abrupt silence around her.

00:29:42.170 --> 00:29:45.430
She picked up her bag and
walked out with as much dignity

00:29:45.430 --> 00:29:48.290
as she could muster,
her pace measured,

00:29:48.290 --> 00:29:52.340
her shoulders held
straight, defiant even.

00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.870
But inside, she could feel
the weight of her heart.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:59.420
And it felt so much heavier
than she ever remembered.

00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.510
Thank you very much.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:11.650
[ Applause ]

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:14.400
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: But
before starting my questions,

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:19.820
I'd like to congratulate you
on your most recent award,

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.330
the Nigerian Prize for Literature,

00:30:22.330 --> 00:30:26.690
the 2016 Nigerian Prize
for Literature.

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:27.990
Congratulations on that.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
Thank you very much.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.590
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine:

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:33.970
And congratulations
on a beautiful story.

00:30:33.970 --> 00:30:35.980 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Thank you.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.420
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: My
first question would be:

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:43.090
When did you actually start
writing and why did you turn

00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:46.950
to the novel as a literary genre?

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.850
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: When
did I start writing as general

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:51.530
or when did I start
writing this book?

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:52.830
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: In general.

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:55.770
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
In general.

00:30:55.770 --> 00:30:58.940
I wish I can remember.

00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.300
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: It can't
be that far back [Laughs].

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:06.260
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Well,
for someone who has lived as long

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.480
as I have, which is not very long,

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.710
but this is something
I've always been doing.

00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:18.040
I've always been interested in
telling stories, in, you know,

00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:20.370
somehow capturing a narrative.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.510
Even before I could write,
I was drawing pictures

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.520
that somehow connected
and formed a story,

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.920
you know, have this narrative act.

00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.760
And then when I could read
and write, I just took off.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:35.530
You know? So yeah, I think

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:40.540
at the points I consciously
started writing I was 13, you know.

00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.180
By the time I was 18 I was
sure it was what I wanted to do

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:46.630
with the rest of my life.

00:31:46.630 --> 00:31:49.830
So here we are [Laughs].

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:51.130
Yeah.

00:31:51.130 --> 00:31:54.040
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: In
a previous interview,

00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.990
you noted that northern Nigeria
is severely underrepresented

00:31:58.990 --> 00:32:02.650 position:56%
in the canon of Nigerian literature.

00:32:02.650 --> 00:32:08.080
Now, northern Nigeria has a
literary tradition dating back,

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.350
what, ninth, tenth century?

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:19.000 position:56%
So is there a uniqueness in northern
Nigeria literature and particularly

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.910
in the present climate of
northern Nigeria literature?

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.530
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Well,

00:32:25.530 --> 00:32:28.260
when you talk about
northern Nigerian literature,

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.670
it has a history.

00:32:30.670 --> 00:32:36.680
You know? You've been to Nigeria
before and you know the history

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:42.010 position:56%
of writing in the north of Nigeria,
which dates back for ages, you know.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:43.310
But the thing is this,

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:48.890
the literature you find is written
mostly in what is called Ajani,

00:32:48.890 --> 00:32:51.000
which is using Arabic letters

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.530
to capture words and
phrases [inaudible].

00:32:54.530 --> 00:33:00.520
And that dates back to
-- I don't know how long.

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:03.820
The Arabs first came to the north
of Nigeria in the 14th century,

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.890
so that influenced us in there.

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:09.890
What you've had is that
there has been a tradition

00:33:09.890 --> 00:33:11.970
of writing in the north.

00:33:11.970 --> 00:33:13.890
I remember in the ninth,

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:16.750
tenth century there was a German
translation of a love poem

00:33:16.750 --> 00:33:20.340
from Hausa into German
by a German explorer

00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.170 position:56%
who happened to travel to the north.

00:33:22.170 --> 00:33:25.930
So there has been this
history of writing.

00:33:25.930 --> 00:33:31.780
And most recently you have
this huge literature in Hausa

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:34.170
that has been produced, which
is something I've [inaudible]

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:35.470
in this book.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.770
It's called the Soyayya novels.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:39.380
Mostly they're love
stories written by women,

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.200
but they are written in Hausa.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:44.260
So it is for the consumption
of people who speak Hausa.

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.960
So it's essentially the
north talking to itself

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.400
about the north, about
their own issues.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.280
But when you talk about
Nigerian literature in English,

00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:57.890
there is a shortage of material
from the north of Nigeria.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:03.020
So I felt it was important to
kind of drag the north of Nigeria

00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:07.170
into the mainstream of Nigerian
literature in that sense and,

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:09.870
you know, start up
conversations about people.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:14.600
Because there's a lot of
misunderstanding, if you like,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:16.950
of why the different
people of Nigeria, you know,

00:34:16.950 --> 00:34:19.000
people in the east have
different ideas about the people

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.360
in the north and vice versa.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.660
So it's all over the place.

00:34:21.660 --> 00:34:26.260
And I felt that literature is one
of the ways that we could break

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:29.370
down these barriers and create
that understanding of people.

00:34:29.370 --> 00:34:33.510
But because the north is not
writing its own stories in a way

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.140
that people outside of that
region would understand,

00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:43.080
there is this constant should
I say projection of stereotypes

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:46.340
and stale ideas that
are not essentially true

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:48.450
about the region, about its people.

00:34:48.450 --> 00:34:53.270
So that was what I
wanted to do [inaudible].

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:55.100
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Okay.

00:34:55.100 --> 00:35:00.000
Now, in your debut novel,
you're speaking quite openly

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.470 position:56%
about female sexuality, which is
pretty much a socially taboo subject

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:07.890
in northern Nigeria.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:09.830
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.480
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: You also address
a number of other social issues.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:18.430
So what, really, was your
intent in writing this novel?

00:35:18.430 --> 00:35:19.850
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
Well, the principal intent was

00:35:19.850 --> 00:35:24.120
to tell a good story --
principally that was the intent.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.680
But then along the line you
realize that as you are trying

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:30.690
to capture the story of these
two characters who happen

00:35:30.690 --> 00:35:35.550
to have this relationship across
class divide and all that,

00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:37.540 position:56%
all that [inaudible] come into play.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:41.390 position:56%
Because they are from different age,
they are from different backgrounds,

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:46.120
the social cultural context has
to have an impact, you know?

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:48.580
And all these things came
together in the narration,

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:53.260
in how the story played out,
and how the characters think

00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:56.640
and how they behave in essence.

00:35:56.640 --> 00:36:00.730
So yeah, that was essentially
the principal objective,

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:04.880
to tell a good story.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.160
Yeah, talking about sexuality,

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.830
it's a very important
thing, I think, you know?

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:16.920
Because it dictates a lot of things

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:21.310
that people don't even
want to acknowledge.

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:24.530
Someone said that if you look
at the history of the world,

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.610
most of the conflicts
could have been avoided

00:36:26.610 --> 00:36:30.500
if people have probably
had better sexual relations

00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.010
with their partners.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:33.720
[ Laughter ]

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.200
And if you think about it
critically, it's somehow true.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:40.700
Because someone might
wake up with some kind

00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.010
of sexual frustration
one way or the other,

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:46.880
and something that is very
insignificant will suddenly take

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.150
on a whole new dimension
in his mind.

00:36:49.150 --> 00:36:52.160
You know? And then there's
been a lot of trouble

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:54.100
because of people having sex

00:36:54.100 --> 00:36:57.680
with people they shouldn't
be having sex with.

00:36:57.680 --> 00:37:04.140
You know, someone who is very
reasonable, very rational has sex

00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.240
with someone he is not supposed
to have sex with and ends

00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.430
up doing very stupid
things, you know?

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:11.480
And then you have stupid
people having sex

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:15.290
with people they shouldn't have sex
with and are doing smart things.

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.550
So it has different kinds
of impacts on people,

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:22.010
and that is essentially what
Binta and Reza were doing.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:25.190
And then also we don't
want to talk about sex,

00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:30.270
we pretend we don't do
it, but that is not true.

00:37:30.270 --> 00:37:33.390
I've been asked before, "So,
where is this story coming from?"

00:37:33.390 --> 00:37:36.010
I say, "Look at the
population of the north."

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:37.310
[ Laughter ]

00:37:37.310 --> 00:37:39.760
Yeah, something has to be
happening for all of these children

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.900
to be coming from somewhere.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:46.930
And the truth is that the
north is very conservative.

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.270
It is a very religious
community in the sense

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.840
that it is religious both ways.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.850
You know, the Muslim
north very religious;

00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.040
the Christian north is
equally very religious.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.330
So we have all this conflict
of religion, of faith.

00:38:01.330 --> 00:38:03.580
And it merges so much
with the culture

00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.640
that at some point you don't
know where religion ends

00:38:05.640 --> 00:38:08.700
and where culture begins.

00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:12.360
So people talk about
sex, sexual relationship

00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.340
in harsh tones, you know?

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:17.540
And I felt it's important to kind
of bring it into the foreground,

00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.530
into the mainstream of
conversation so that

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:24.330
to understand exactly
what is happening.

00:38:24.330 --> 00:38:28.040
The story here is about Binta who,
for the better part of her life,

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.970
has been sexually frustrated
because her relationship

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:36.460
with her husband hasn't been
-- you know, wasn't great.

00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:38.600
Essentially he was
a stranger to her.

00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:43.130
And she just married him out of
obedience to her parents' command.

00:38:43.130 --> 00:38:47.060
And for the bulk of her life
when we wanted to take initiative

00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:52.080
in sexual relationship, she was
put down very strongly, you know?

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.380
And it had an impact on her.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:56.860
And then after her husband
died, she had this opportunity

00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:59.260
of having a relationship with
someone who is much younger

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:02.790 position:56%
than her, but someone who is capable

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:04.550
of giving her what
she always desired.

00:39:04.550 --> 00:39:09.450
And all of a sudden the society
said, "Wait, this is our business.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:12.150
Who you do things with in our
bedroom is exactly our business.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:16.890
So we're going to intervene
and do stuff about it."

00:39:16.890 --> 00:39:18.190
You know.

00:39:18.190 --> 00:39:19.490
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: I would ask you,

00:39:19.490 --> 00:39:21.070
are you speaking for
women or as a man?

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:23.120
[ Laughter ]

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.960
But that's another old question.

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.260
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:39:27.260 --> 00:39:35.110
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Another question
that I do have is when you look

00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:40.180
at the literary creations that
are emerging throughout Africa,

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:46.340
throughout the African diaspora,
are there certain trends,

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:50.710
are there certain themes that are
emerging in this literary world?

00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:56.240
And where does your work fit
into this new literary trend?

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.390
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Huh.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:05.020
Well, it fits -- I think I will let
the experts and academic decide.

00:40:05.020 --> 00:40:07.970
My job is to write a
book, which I've done.

00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:12.730
So I'm giving the academics
something to work with, I hope.

00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:19.780 position:56%
But yes, there's a new voice coming
out of the continent and it is bold.

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.540
And some people think
it's irreverent as well.

00:40:22.540 --> 00:40:26.200
I think it is both.

00:40:26.200 --> 00:40:30.700
And I think it's become necessary
because there are barriers

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.520
that have been there for ages
and ages, and those barriers need

00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.020
to go for whatever reason.

00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:38.520
We need to advance, we need to talk

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:42.740
about things we are
not talking about.

00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:46.390 position:56%
Ten years ago, maybe I wouldn't have
written a book like this, you know?

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:48.980
But this, I think, we
need to really talk

00:40:48.980 --> 00:40:52.970
about how these relationships
affect the way we think,

00:40:52.970 --> 00:40:57.690
the way we grow up, and the way
our society's shaped eventually.

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:00.120
So we are having writers
from different parts

00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:03.530
of the continents talking
about things that rotate

00:41:03.530 --> 00:41:06.070
in their own societies
and their own communities,

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:10.320
and they're pushing the barriers,
challenging the frontiers.

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.170
And I think it's important
because the world is opening up.

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:16.490 position:56%
And Africa needs to open up as well.

00:41:16.490 --> 00:41:20.530 position:56%
And we can't do that unless we push
down barriers and have conversations

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:24.210
about the things that shape
the way we think, you know?

00:41:24.210 --> 00:41:27.220
So that is a very important thing.

00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:29.280
And I'm very proud to be
part of this generation

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:36.340
that is challenging those frontiers
and breaking down those barriers.

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:37.640
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Okay.

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:42.720
And my final question to you would
be what steps need to be taken

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:47.160
to bring recognition from
the international community

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.850
to African literary scholarship?

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:53.930
Or do you think steps
need to be taken?

00:41:55.100 --> 00:42:01.600
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Well,
of course, there are things

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:05.400
that need to be done, you know?

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:10.940
And I think it starts with us, the
writers and Africans and all of us.

00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.600
We need to tell our own stories.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.660 position:56%
We need to believe in our own
stories and believe in our own voice

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:20.130
and tell our stories the
way they should be told.

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:27.350
I think because the publishing
industry based is in the West,

00:42:27.350 --> 00:42:29.720
if you like, they are
the gatekeepers.

00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.000
So they determine which stories
from Africa come out there,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.450
which ones are considered
good enough to be published

00:42:36.450 --> 00:42:40.000
by whoever wants to publish them.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:43.610
But when you have publishers
on the continent --

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:46.940
and we've had a few of them
coming up Nigeria, for instance.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:51.690
Cassava Republic represented
by Emma Shercliff, you know,

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:53.060
they're doing a wonderful job.

00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:56.860
And they've given Africa
writers the boldness

00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.680
to tell their stories the
way they want it to be told.

00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:02.390
And I think that is the
first step, you know?

00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:06.820 position:56%
We need the stories to be available
first before later maybe we can sort

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:09.770
them out and say, "Okay, let's have
a conversation about these things."

00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:12.070
But the important thing
is we need to write,

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:16.560
we need to tell our stories.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.860
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Okay.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.160
I thank you.

00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.460 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Thank you.

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:21.760
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: Again,

00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.110
I congratulate you
on your debut novel.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:29.500
At this point we'll have a
Q&amp;A, a brief Q&amp;A session.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.360
And I'd also like to note that
the author will do book signings

00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:38.510
down in the gift shop
following this program.

00:43:38.510 --> 00:43:47.270 position:56%
So for any of you who are interested
in books, we'll go to the gift shop.

00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:49.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much.

00:43:49.550 --> 00:43:54.910 position:56%
I loved the readings and the way you
answer the questions and everything.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:56.210
So I have a question.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:57.510
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Yes.

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:00.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; You talk about breaking the
barriers and telling your own story;

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:04.250
can you say something
more about the barriers?

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:10.690
What are the barriers that
are holding back young writers

00:44:10.690 --> 00:44:13.940
from writing, potential writers?

00:44:13.940 --> 00:44:15.240
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Yeah.

00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.410
Okay. For instance, right, from
the north of Nigeria where I come

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.990
from where I have spoken about
this rich literary tradition

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:26.530
that we have, we write what
we call Soyayya novels,

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:29.880
which in essence translate
as romance novels, right?

00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.680
But in these romance novels you
don't have any kind of contacts

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:39.700
between unmarried people in
public spaces, in private spaces.

00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.780
You don't talk about sex.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:46.540
You know? And that is the way
the culture has shaped people not

00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.840
to engage with these issues.

00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:50.590
So you have people falling
in love, but you don't talk

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.670
about them kissing or
holding hands or -- you know?

00:44:53.670 --> 00:44:56.890
And I talk about married people
having relationships and you avoid

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.870
as much as you can the issues
of sex, and sexual frustration,

00:44:59.870 --> 00:45:02.270 position:56%
and the consequence of those things.

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:04.110
So those are some of
the barriers that are,

00:45:04.110 --> 00:45:05.530
you know, holding people back.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:10.080
And as far as I'm concerned, they
are issues that need to be tackled

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:15.200
because they are at the heart
of our orientation as a people.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:20.330 position:56%
You know? So there are subjects that
are considered taboo in a way --

00:45:20.330 --> 00:45:25.020
sexuality and all that -- but then
people are challenging those issues

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:27.510
and they're talking about them now.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:32.020
And I think it's important to
start these conversations one way

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:33.320
or the other.

00:45:33.320 --> 00:45:35.990
So those are some of the issues
that people need to talk about.

00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:39.150
Second issue is that the lack

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:42.510
of publishing infrastructure
is a major issue.

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:47.360
And I believe that if you have
enough publishers on the continent,

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.750
you know, you have more than enough
stories to tell to the publisher

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:52.740
to be shared with the world.

00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.510
So yeah, we're getting
there somehow.

00:45:55.510 --> 00:49:04.560
[ Inaudible ]

00:49:04.560 --> 00:49:07.050
Maybe if you read the book
you'll find out, right?

00:49:07.050 --> 00:49:09.090
[ Laughter ]

00:49:09.090 --> 00:49:13.590
But then again, it's Nigerian.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:16.270
So he spoke about certain issues.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:19.320
I knew [inaudible]
had written a book.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:22.540
And, you know, he's not the
only prominent northerner

00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:23.840
to have written a book.

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.870
Tafawa Balewa, the
first prime minister

00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:28.010
of Nigeria, was an author as well.

00:49:28.010 --> 00:49:31.460
You know? So the tradition
has always been there.

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:36.750
In terms of book promotion,
I think --

00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:42.410
I don't know, people kind of place
these expectations on authors to --

00:49:42.410 --> 00:49:44.850
and that is because we
don't have the publishing

00:49:44.850 --> 00:49:46.150
structure [inaudible].

00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:51.320
But people have expectations
on writers to be publishers,

00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:53.650
to be book promoters,
to be everything.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:55.620
It's simply not possible.

00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:58.830
Some people are good at
writing, that's what they can do.

00:49:58.830 --> 00:50:00.780
Some people are good at
promoting other people's work,

00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:02.160
and that's what they can do.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.240
So we need the structures, really.

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:08.580
There are people who are
struggling to be writers,

00:50:08.580 --> 00:50:11.260
who to be honest shouldn't
even bother.

00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:14.500
They should work in
certain [inaudible],

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.750
maybe be editors or something.

00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:20.920
I have people who have written
books and every day they ask me,

00:50:20.920 --> 00:50:22.220
"Where can we find an editor?"

00:50:22.220 --> 00:50:24.320
And you have problems
recommending editors to them

00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.000
because there aren't enough
people training themselves

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.300
to become editors.

00:50:28.300 --> 00:50:31.060
You know, everybody wants to
write, everybody wants to publish.

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.360
It's a challenge.

00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.740
So there's the need for that
diversification could be there,

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.040
you know?

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:42.310
So yeah. Religious
freedom and whatnot,

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:46.550
[inaudible] is a complex case.

00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:49.990
You and I know that, right?

00:50:49.990 --> 00:50:51.950
People use religion.

00:50:51.950 --> 00:50:55.310
And especially the leaders of
that region, they use religion

00:50:55.310 --> 00:51:01.130
as a mechanism to suppress people,
to keep them, you know, subjugated.

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:03.290
And it is not right,
it is very wrong.

00:51:03.290 --> 00:51:08.310
I remember an instance
where a cousin of mine went

00:51:08.310 --> 00:51:12.530
to serve [inaudible], which
is far up in the north.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:16.180 position:56%
And the idea of the youth
services, you know, after graduating

00:51:16.180 --> 00:51:20.540
from university you dedicate
a year to serve your country.

00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:23.540
So you are posted to a different
part from where you come from

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:26.680
and you cannot participate
in some community services.

00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:30.960
So when he went there, a permanent
citizen of that area said,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:35.180
"You know, these are people, the
way you see them, just let them be.

00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:37.580
Don't try to influence them,
don't try to change them.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:39.030
They will never change."

00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:41.370
So he couldn't understand.

00:51:41.370 --> 00:51:44.410
So after a few weeks there he
realized what was happening.

00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:47.520
That man, along with a few others,

00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.590
[inaudible] people
in that community.

00:51:49.590 --> 00:51:52.460
So there is nothing that a
government would want to do

00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:55.170
to that community that doesn't
have to come through them.

00:51:55.170 --> 00:51:57.690
You know? So they don't want other
people to [inaudible] to come

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:01.630
and participate in whatever's going
on and sharing ideas and all that.

00:52:01.630 --> 00:52:05.130
So often they get allocations from
governments and they divert them

00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:08.110
to private use and
people don't know.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:10.690
Because they are the
ones who are -- you know?

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:12.060
So we have this issue.

00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:16.220
We have -- I mean, the attacks on
the emir of Kano, for instance,

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:20.800 position:56%
is he is a religious leader in a
way and he's also a cultural leader,

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.070
but he's speaking the
truths to the north.

00:52:23.070 --> 00:52:25.570
And the north is not
entirely pleased by that

00:52:25.570 --> 00:52:28.590
because they don't expect that
kind of challenge to comes

00:52:28.590 --> 00:52:30.350
from its leaders, you know?

00:52:30.350 --> 00:52:32.500
So we have issues that
we need to deal with.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:37.050
And in a way you talk
about religious revivalism,

00:52:37.050 --> 00:52:42.290
which started in the north in the
1970's and continued into the '80s.

00:52:42.290 --> 00:52:44.760
In a way you want to think it's a
good thing, but then you look at it

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:48.720
and you realize that maybe it's
not such a great thing sometimes.

00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:52.740
Because we have now issues
of fundamentalism going

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.840
on in the north, you have Boko
Haram and all of them sprouted

00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:58.470
from this revivalism and all that.

00:52:58.470 --> 00:53:02.180
So it is also suppressing
conversation.

00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:05.270
And I think that is where I have
a problem with it, you know?

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:08.630
We need to be more open, we need
to have conversations about things

00:53:08.630 --> 00:53:10.750
in a very civilized context.

00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:13.500
So yeah.

00:53:13.500 --> 00:53:19.620 position:56%
&gt;&gt; My question kind of has two part.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:22.940
The first part is about
Nigerian literature

00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:25.790
and where you see you fit in.

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.320 position:56%
I consider Nigeria [inaudible] to be

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.140
like the diesel engine
of African literature.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:32.560
It's got history.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.600
So I'm quite sure that it's --

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:40.080
I'd like to hear how you
see yourselves fitting

00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.380
into that larger fabric.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:47.000
And the second question is,
is the lid completely off

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:51.650
on African literature
now or are there things

00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:56.740 position:56%
within African societies that will
maybe not allow the level of freedom

00:53:56.740 --> 00:54:00.720
of expression that you
might have in the West?

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:04.560
And is the West influencing
some of those topics

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:10.940
and making them more exposed
within African literature?

00:54:16.130 --> 00:54:18.390
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Is
the West having this influence?

00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:22.160
Yeah, sometimes we want to look
at the West as the big bad wolf

00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:26.300
that is just waiting to eat
up Little Red Riding Hood.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.910
But then in some cases
you look at it

00:54:29.910 --> 00:54:32.080 position:56%
and you say, "Yeah, maybe they are."

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.840
Because like I mentioned
earlier, they are the gatekeepers.

00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:37.520
They have this publishing
infrastructure.

00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.860
So they determine what kind
of stories they publish.

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.830
Sometimes I want to believe
them, but sometimes I prefer

00:54:45.830 --> 00:54:49.930
to take responsibility
for [inaudible] we do.

00:54:49.930 --> 00:54:52.930
And I think it's high time
we stopped the blame game

00:54:52.930 --> 00:54:58.330
and shifting the buck and
do what we really can do.

00:54:58.330 --> 00:55:01.270
It's easy to say that, "Well, I
mean, the West dictates the kind

00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:02.830
of stories we tell
because they are the one

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:06.450
who accept the manuscripts
and publish them."

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.570
But then if you don't have
people like Cassava Republic

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.470 position:56%
and other publishers challenging
and creating avenues for the stories

00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:15.530 position:56%
to get out, then you have a problem.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:19.540
You know? The second
question you asked?

00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; First actually, the first one,
where do you see yourself as fitting

00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:33.070
into that kind of mythical,
you know, or legendary --

00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:41.390
this literary -- when
you're [inaudible].

00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:43.510
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: I guess
when I get there, I'll find out.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:46.040
[ Laughter ]

00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:47.720
For now I only think about writing

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.620
and writing what I hope will
be good stories that people all

00:55:51.620 --> 00:55:53.440
over the world would relate with.

00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:58.120
I'm very conscious of what I
write about, and I'm conscious

00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:00.890
of the background I come from.

00:56:00.890 --> 00:56:04.720
But I'm equally very conscious
that I want my stories

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.940
to have a universal appeal --

00:56:06.940 --> 00:56:11.400
universal in the sense that I
want people in rural England

00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:15.560
and maybe small town America
to read the book and connect

00:56:15.560 --> 00:56:19.530
to the universal human concern
that my characters share.

00:56:19.530 --> 00:56:25.960
Like I said, I am from the
north, and we have this issue of,

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.490
if you call like, call
it "othernization,"

00:56:28.490 --> 00:56:31.040
you know, everyone is the other.

00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:33.340
You know? Even in the
Nigerian context,

00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:36.250
not to talk about the
global universal context.

00:56:36.250 --> 00:56:40.220
So this othernization is something
I'm really keen on taking down,

00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:43.740 position:56%
you know, and to break down barriers
so that people are conscious

00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:49.220
that yes, Hajiya Binta, who is a
character in my novel is a Muslim,

00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:52.560
is a northerner; but then
she has universal concerns

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.980
that an average American has, that
an average Japanese person has.

00:56:57.980 --> 00:57:00.770
So these are the things that
I'm really interested in.

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:03.800
Where I situate myself,
I don't think I'm

00:57:03.800 --> 00:57:06.790
in a position to judge yet.

00:57:06.790 --> 00:57:09.170
Someday I guess we'll find out.

00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:11.330
[ Laughter ]

00:57:11.330 --> 00:57:13.060
Yes. Hello.

00:57:13.060 --> 00:57:18.210
&gt;&gt; Hello. I was curious
how this model --

00:57:18.210 --> 00:57:22.450
and even your earlier
question for stories --

00:57:22.450 --> 00:57:25.630
how people reacted
in northern Nigeria?

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:28.730
And, you know, this novel,

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.800
is it widely available,
can people read it?

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:38.070
And to what extent have you heard
from, you know, ordinary readers?

00:57:38.070 --> 00:57:42.030
And also, I wonder if you've
gotten into any trouble,

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.510
if your book has had the
honor of being, you know --

00:57:44.510 --> 00:57:47.040
[ Laughter ]

00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:49.690
You know, is it in any way
sort of taboo for people

00:57:49.690 --> 00:57:52.850
to read it in northern Nigeria?

00:57:52.850 --> 00:57:54.560
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
Fortunately,

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.100
it hasn't gotten to that level.

00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:02.990
When the book was launched
in Lagos in November 2015,

00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:05.570
I remember there was someone

00:58:05.570 --> 00:58:09.470
who was genuinely concerned
for my safety, you know?

00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:11.080
And she felt, "Wow, we're talking

00:58:11.080 --> 00:58:12.780
about things northerners
don't talk about.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.710
You'll get in trouble."

00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:19.440
And she was so concerned
that actually sent me a link

00:58:19.440 --> 00:58:26.550
to a residency for
artists who are threatened.

00:58:26.550 --> 00:58:30.390
And she strongly encouraged me
to apply just in case [Laughs].

00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:34.590
And your questions
about the possibility

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:44.670 position:56%
of a fatwa being declared against
me, and yeah, at some point you kind

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:46.160
of entertain those concerns.

00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:52.210
But what I did is that
I felt that I'd done --

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:55.740
and now this is me going into a
zone that I shouldn't go into --

00:58:55.740 --> 00:59:01.110
but I had the confidence that I
had done justice to this issue

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:07.570
in portraying the people of the
north and the north itself in a way

00:59:07.570 --> 00:59:13.260 position:56%
that is not derogatory but in a way
that is frank and honest, that says,

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.700
"You know, these are
the issues you have.

00:59:15.700 --> 00:59:17.880
And if you look at
yourself in the mirror,

00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:20.390
you'll actually see
these issues are there."

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:23.390
And then you reflect,
which is what I want.

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:25.440
People should reflect about
it, and think about it,

00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:27.660
and think of making changes.

00:59:27.660 --> 00:59:30.380
No, I haven't been
threatened yet [Laughs].

00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:34.910
And the book is widely
available in the north.

00:59:34.910 --> 00:59:40.790
I think we've gone through several
reprints in Nigeria already.

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:44.240
Yeah, the reception has been good.

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.570
And I think I've had reactions
from readers in the north,

00:59:48.570 --> 00:59:51.710
women especially who
say, "Well, you know,

00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:54.670
this has some really naughty
things you talked about.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:57.600
But then to be honest, this is us."

00:59:57.600 --> 01:00:02.180
You know? And for me, that is the
greatest compliment you could get

01:00:02.180 --> 01:00:03.590
from the people you
are writing about.

01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:05.320
So.

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:09.730
&gt;&gt; Hi. Just sort of -- your answer
sort of leads into my question

01:00:09.730 --> 01:00:14.050
that how did you land on the main
character, a 55-year-old woman,

01:00:14.050 --> 01:00:20.340
since typically 55-year-old
women aren't the main characters

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.120
of many novels these days?

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.420
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Oh.

01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.720
[Inaudible], okay.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.560
Yeah, how the story came to me.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:33.400
I was sitting down, minding
my business, you know,

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.130
watching Barcelona [Laughs].

01:00:36.130 --> 01:00:42.680
But then I had this vision of
this very rascally person jumping

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.340
over a woman's fence and going
into her house to burglar it

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.810
and then ends up meeting
the owner of the house.

01:00:49.810 --> 01:00:53.730
So I became really curious
about what the burglar

01:00:53.730 --> 01:00:55.920
and the person who's being burgled.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.450
And I said, "You know, just
follow them and see what happens."

01:00:58.450 --> 01:01:00.950
And that was how the
story came about.

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:06.680
So I've also been really
curious about age

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:10.830
and sexuality, especially
in Nigeria.

01:01:10.830 --> 01:01:14.170
It's very common to have a
60-year-old man marrying a girl

01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:17.200
who is 17 or 18, you
know, and nobody frowns

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:20.220
about it or nobody frowns at it.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:25.120
But then if a woman who is 35
is marrying someone who is 27,

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.250
you know, it becomes a problem.

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:29.160
What do you mean, she's older?

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.500
Old enough to be your mother?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.120
That is what they will tell you.

01:01:32.120 --> 01:01:38.380
You know? I remember when
I was in secondary school

01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:41.850
and I was dating this girl who
was in the same class as me.

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:43.340
We were the same age.

01:01:43.340 --> 01:01:47.280
And I took her to see my mom.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.810
And my mom was very hospitable,
she received her well.

01:01:50.810 --> 01:01:55.740
After the girl went, my mom
said, "She's a nice girl,

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:57.960
but she's too old for you."

01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:02.400
And I was like, "Okay.

01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:04.560
But she's my age [inaudible],
right?"

01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:09.550
So when I was 26 I dated a girl who
was 26, same age, same everything.

01:02:09.550 --> 01:02:12.430
And, again, of course, I
wanted to marry her then

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:14.700
because I was 26, right,
not 17 or 18.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:22.110
And my mom said, "Oh, she's a nice
girl, but she's too old for you."

01:02:22.110 --> 01:02:24.970
[Laughs] So these perceptions
are common.

01:02:24.970 --> 01:02:29.750
In Nigeria it's common that
you should have maybe five,

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:33.780
ten years difference between
a man and a woman marrying;

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:37.550
but the man has to be older, right?

01:02:37.550 --> 01:02:39.960
So I was, like, if
we reverse this role,

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.450
what if the woman is older
who's having this relationship

01:02:42.450 --> 01:02:46.290
with this guy who is much
younger, what happens?

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.180
So that was one of the
premise I started off with.

01:02:49.180 --> 01:02:54.240
And then again, you have issues
of how would her children react,

01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:58.420
how would people around react,
how would they see these issues?

01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.440
And I felt it's important
because most times when we talk

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:07.670 position:56%
about the sexuality of older women,
we -- in Nigeria we say sugar mommy.

01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:09.790
You know? And the general
perception is that well,

01:03:09.790 --> 01:03:12.080
she's going into it for the sex.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:15.100
And she has to pay the young
guy to agree to sleep with her.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.890
And in this scenario
that is not the case.

01:03:17.890 --> 01:03:20.270
Yes, sex was at the heart
of the relationship,

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:22.800
but there was something much more.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.130
For Binta there was this desire to
redeem this character, you know,

01:03:27.130 --> 01:03:30.030
the character of Hausa Reza,
to make him a better person

01:03:30.030 --> 01:03:32.080
in her own, you know, fashion.

01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:36.200
So that was something that was
playing in her mind as well.

01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:39.430
So it wasn't really -- I was
trying to break this mold

01:03:39.430 --> 01:03:42.960
of older women being sugar
mommies for whatever reason.

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.810
People can have relationship
for something much more profound

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:51.860
than for, you know, just the
pleasure of it and then for sake

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:55.020
of making some extra
income or something.

01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.320
So yeah.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:04:01.010
&gt;&gt; I have one last question.

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:04.510
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
One last question.

01:04:04.510 --> 01:04:44.490
[ Inaudible ]

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:49.920
&gt;&gt; And lastly, any plans
to turn this into a film?

01:04:51.850 --> 01:04:56.270 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: The title.

01:04:56.270 --> 01:05:02.450
Well, I think the title
came before the book came.

01:05:02.450 --> 01:05:05.330
So when I wrote the book,
I kind of wrote the title

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:08.180
into the book so that works.

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:15.350 position:56%
But then I wanted to capture
something that is beautiful and then

01:05:15.350 --> 01:05:19.930
at the same time has several levels
of interpretations, you know?

01:05:19.930 --> 01:05:24.710
So a season of crimson
blossoms is a beautiful season.

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:27.930
For Binta, this blossoming
that she had very late

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:30.390
on in her life is something
beautiful.

01:05:30.390 --> 01:05:35.070
But then again, it comes
with a price, you know?

01:05:35.070 --> 01:05:39.150
So it's beautiful and then it's
-- it's crimson, for god's sake.

01:05:39.150 --> 01:05:41.380
It's red, which means
[inaudible], right?

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.690
So that's that element.

01:05:43.690 --> 01:05:51.170
And there's this element of the
violence, the level of violence

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.850 position:56%
that forms the background of the
story, you know, which is again red.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:06:02.290
So those were the things I was
trying to capture in the title.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.480
And the proverbs, yeah.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:11.520
Yeah, I thought that was a
cute thing to do [Laughs].

01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:16.000
So yeah, I wanted to
do that, really.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.740
I put them in when I
was writing this story.

01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:21.990
And then at some point
when I was writing,

01:06:21.990 --> 01:06:24.150
I thought I should take them out.

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:26.880
And an editor said, "If you
dare touch those proverbs,

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.190
I'm going to kill you."

01:06:29.190 --> 01:06:30.490 position:56%
[Laughs] So I decided to leave them.

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:32.970
That's how they ended
up being in the book.

01:06:32.970 --> 01:06:38.430
Yeah. But then, again, it's for
me, those proverbs are some kind

01:06:38.430 --> 01:06:43.080
of philosophical nuggets, if
you look at them that way.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:45.170
Sometimes people wanting
philosophies

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:47.200
so [inaudible] the west.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.550
But then when you read our
proverbs, you read them,

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:52.560
you see meanings, you
know, deep meaning.

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:53.860
And you kind of wonder.

01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:55.160
And that was what I did.

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:57.950
I wondered who would sit down
and think about this thing

01:06:57.950 --> 01:07:01.110
and then phrase them in
such a way that they are

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:03.570
so powerful, and short,
and poignant?

01:07:03.570 --> 01:07:08.470 position:56%
And I thought it's a shame that we
are letting these things go instead.

01:07:08.470 --> 01:07:17.530
And I kind of wanted to capture
them and preserve them in my book.

01:07:17.530 --> 01:07:21.730
So I'm happy there is
an [inaudible] here.

01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.700
That's good.

01:07:24.700 --> 01:07:31.250
Okay, I have the mic.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.760
So yeah [Laughs].

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:36.940
&gt;&gt; I'm a [inaudible]
student from the University

01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.240
of Baltimore [inaudible].

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:39.800
I wanted to know what African
literature are you reading?

01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:42.660
What is some of your favorites or
what are you reading right now?

01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:44.540
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
What am I reading right now?

01:07:44.540 --> 01:07:46.840
Right now I'm not reading
an African book.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:53.340
It's titled <i>A Case of Exploding
Mangoes</i> by Hanif Mohammed.

01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.640
It's Pakistani.

01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.210
That's what I'm reading
at the moment.

01:07:56.210 --> 01:08:02.330
I've been reading a lot
of African novels, a lot.

01:08:02.330 --> 01:08:03.900
The most recent is [inaudible].

01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.970
So yeah, I've had influences,
of course,

01:08:07.970 --> 01:08:09.890
from the works of Chinua Achebe.

01:08:09.890 --> 01:08:11.310
Every African writer knows, right?

01:08:11.310 --> 01:08:14.950
Achebe [inaudible] is one of
my favorite African writers.

01:08:14.950 --> 01:08:19.090
You talk about Naguib
Mahfouz, a Nobel laureate.

01:08:19.090 --> 01:08:24.490
So yeah, there's this
rich background

01:08:24.490 --> 01:08:27.930
of African literature
to draw from, you know?

01:08:27.930 --> 01:08:30.650
And I'm delighted we
have this background

01:08:30.650 --> 01:08:36.590
and these resources to connect to.

01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:37.890
So.

01:08:37.890 --> 01:08:39.190
&gt;&gt; Okay.

01:08:39.190 --> 01:08:40.500
[ Inaudible ]

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:42.300
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Yeah.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:57.680
[ Inaudible ]

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:02.040
I come from Jos.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.340
&gt;&gt; Yes, I know.

01:09:03.340 --> 01:09:05.040
[ Laughter ]

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:07.510
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: So
does that answer the question?

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:16.830
[ Inaudible ]

01:09:16.830 --> 01:09:18.130
Perhaps yes.

01:09:18.130 --> 01:09:20.710
You know, for those
who don't know Jos,

01:09:20.710 --> 01:09:23.240
it is a city in central Nigeria,

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:24.540
which is more in the
north [inaudible].

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:29.100
So it's kind of northern
Nigeria, but it's central.

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.410
And it's very cosmopolitan.

01:09:30.410 --> 01:09:33.080
It has a large population
of Muslims and Christians.

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.720
So you live in proximity
to Muslims and Christians.

01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:41.030
But then, again, in 2001,
like I mentioned in the novel,

01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:43.580
there was a complete
breakdown of law and order

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:48.670
and there were violence between
Muslim and Christians, you know?

01:09:48.670 --> 01:09:51.840
And the fact is that Jos is
segregated into small communities

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:55.650
of Muslim groups, your
Christian groups there.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:59.540
So it's difficult for me not to
associate the Jos I grew up in

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.720
with the Jos that exists presently.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.630
There are communities that
are some Muslim when you go

01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:10.290
into now you don't feel comfortable
because you feel threatened.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:12.270
You feel that your
life is in danger.

01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:15.300
And there are communities that
if a Christian walks into,

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:17.310
he feels threatened or so.

01:10:17.310 --> 01:10:22.460
So that is the reality that I have
today as the background of my life.

01:10:22.460 --> 01:10:27.550
And it sort of reflects
in this book, you know?

01:10:27.550 --> 01:10:31.840
The fact that I grew up in Jos in
close proximity to all these types

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.060
of people gives me the -- I think
the necessary platform to kind

01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.530
of view all these things from
a very vantaged position.

01:10:39.530 --> 01:10:43.260
So yeah, yeah.

01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.760
Good, thank you.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:47.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: One last question
and then we'll close our program.

01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.800
&gt;&gt; I have a similar question.

01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.100
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: Okay.

01:10:52.100 --> 01:10:55.770
&gt;&gt; You talked about northern
Nigeria and barriers [inaudible].

01:10:55.770 --> 01:11:01.620
How much does that reflect what
goes on in the rest of Nigeria?

01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:04.790
Are there similar taboos
and barriers?

01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:08.970
Is it distinct, like
the [inaudible]?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.570
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim: You
see, the thing is this, right,

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:17.370
Nigeria is a collection of
several countries in one.

01:11:17.370 --> 01:11:22.330
I've heard a writer from southern
Nigeria saying that, "Well,

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:26.140
you know, those northerners,
they are closer to Malians

01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:28.330
than they are to me as a Nigerian."

01:11:28.330 --> 01:11:31.950
Because the cultural
differences are very significant,

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.270
you know, hugely significant.

01:11:34.270 --> 01:11:38.690
But then again, when you look at
the Nigerian society as a whole,

01:11:38.690 --> 01:11:42.810
there are issues that
are common to both.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.130
For instance, the treatment
of widows in the south is --

01:11:50.130 --> 01:11:54.640
well, widows in the south of
Nigeria are considerably worse off

01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.210
than their colleagues in the north
or their counterparts in the north.

01:11:57.210 --> 01:12:02.430
But then again, there's this
issue of subjugation of women,

01:12:02.430 --> 01:12:05.190
of subjugation of sexuality,
and all that.

01:12:05.190 --> 01:12:09.030
And, you know, for me, one
of the things that came

01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:11.390
up when people read this
book in Nigeria in the north

01:12:11.390 --> 01:12:16.070
and in the south -- the other
writer friend I had from Lagos

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:19.470
who read this book and said,
you know, "I'm a Nigerian,

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:21.940
but reading this book is
like I'm being introduced

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:24.220 position:56%
to a completely different universe."

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.780
And that is the extent
of the divide.

01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:30.510 position:56%
But then there are the issues I
talked about, the universal concerns

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:33.750
that people connect to
wherever they are from.

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:38.460
And one of those is that people
who had lost their fathers 10,

01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:43.550
15 years ago, 20 years ago
read this book and they say,

01:12:43.550 --> 01:12:46.000
"You know what I don't
like about this book?

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.240
It made me think about
my mother's sexuality."

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:52.570
Because the assumptions is
that, "Oh, my father is dead,

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:55.670
so no more sex for
her, no more action,

01:12:55.670 --> 01:12:58.030
whatever, and she's done for."

01:12:58.030 --> 01:13:00.820
And then you read this book
and you realize, "Well,

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.650
she's human, she has
this human need.

01:13:02.650 --> 01:13:03.950
She has this."

01:13:03.950 --> 01:13:06.880
So I think it has kind of
created some kind of understanding

01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:11.090
for people about the
needs of their, you know,

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:14.700
widowed mothers or
something like that.

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:19.770
Yeah, I hope I've somehow
answered the question.

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.470
&gt;&gt; Patricia Baine: This
concludes our program.

01:13:21.470 --> 01:13:23.280
So we'd like to thank Abubakar.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:27.640
We'd like to thank Abubakar.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:30.090
And, again, we will
have a book signing

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.440
down in the gift shop
of the Library.

01:13:32.440 --> 01:13:34.690
And that's on the ground floor.

01:13:34.690 --> 01:13:37.510
&gt;&gt; Abubakar Adam Ibrahim:
Thank you very much.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:40.500
[ Applause ]

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.150
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
