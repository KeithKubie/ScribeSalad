00:00:03.086 --> 00:00:08.967
Teotihuacan-- along
the Avenue of the Dead,

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:11.052
multiple structures
show evidence

00:00:11.052 --> 00:00:13.722
of a catastrophic
fire that consumed

00:00:13.722 --> 00:00:17.225
portions of the temple complex.

00:00:17.225 --> 00:00:20.520
The damage has been attributed
to an uprising at the end

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.734
of the sixth century, just
before the population entirely

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:27.068
vanished without a trace.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.116
This structure in
particular, in spite of

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:34.951
the many modern restorations--

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:54.387
NARRATOR: According to
archaeologist Leopoldo Batras,

00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:58.099
who surveyed this site
in the late 19th century,

00:00:58.099 --> 00:01:01.269
the damage seemed too
extensive to be attributed

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.190
to simple torch flames
leading researchers to explore

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.692
alternative explanations

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:29.297
NARRATOR: Could the curious
finds of mica and mercury

00:01:29.297 --> 00:01:33.259
at the site help corroborate the
theory that the burn marks we

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.513
see along the Avenue of
the Dead are from some sort

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.682
of mechanical explosion?

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.811
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.356
and they suggest that like
the Great Pyramid at Giza

00:01:46.356 --> 00:01:48.900
and other sites
throughout the globe,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.319
the structures at
Teotihuacan may

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:54.489
have once served as an
electromagnetic power plant.

00:01:57.742 --> 00:01:59.536
Researchers proposed
that the pyramids

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:03.748
constructed around the world
are, in fact, power plants.

00:02:03.748 --> 00:02:05.416
This is based on
our new knowledge

00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.502
that they in fact
are designed to tap

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:10.547
the resonant power of the
Earth, and then to distribute it

00:02:10.547 --> 00:02:13.550
around the world.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.594
Teotihuacan matches
precisely this model.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.346
It's built over caverns.

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:21.850
It had liquid mercury and mica
incorporated into its design.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.812
And we know that the Gods
came and left from this place.

00:02:25.812 --> 00:02:27.939
So when we put all
the pieces together,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.484
we're looking at Teotihuacan
as yet another example of

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:34.821
the power plants of the gods.

00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:40.034
If it was a technological
system that was generating

00:02:40.034 --> 00:02:42.579
a lot of energy at
some point, there could

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.873
have been a malfunction in it.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:46.457
But there was energy.

00:02:46.457 --> 00:02:50.503
The mica found at the site
was supposed to shield it.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.840
And mercury was also
found at the site

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.134
seems to have been used.

00:02:56.134 --> 00:02:58.595
Perhaps we had some
kind of accident

00:02:58.595 --> 00:02:59.846
there at some point in time.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.982
NARRATOR: If Teotihuacan
served as an ancient power

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:15.194
plant, generating
electromagnetic energy, just

00:03:15.194 --> 00:03:17.030
what role did the
liquid mercury,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.199
recently discovered at the
site, play in such a scenario?

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.999
There's stories of mercury
being used in spacecrafts.

00:03:27.999 --> 00:03:30.418
And some of the
ancient Indian epics

00:03:30.418 --> 00:03:33.546
talk about mercury as
part of the vimanas

00:03:33.546 --> 00:03:36.716
and the mechanics
of these craft.

00:03:36.716 --> 00:03:40.178
So here we have the idea
that this mercury, that's

00:03:40.178 --> 00:03:42.430
being found at
archaeological sites,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.310
is really part of the
propulsion of some of the craft

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.311
that the extraterrestrials
we're using here on Earth.
