00:00:01.756 --> 00:00:07.930
DAVE DARMOFAL: Welcome to 16.101x,
Introduction to Aerodynamics.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.840
Hi, I'm Dave Darmofal.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.830
I'm a professor in the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics at MIT.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.400
ALEJANDRA URANGA: I am Alejandra Uranga,
a research engineer at MIT.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.110
CHAD LIBERMAN: And I'm Chad Lieberman,
postdoctoral associate in the

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.000
Department of Aeronautics
and Astronautics at MIT.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.740
DAVE DARMOFAL: We thought we'd
take a second and explain

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.060
what 16.101x is about.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.600
And what better way to do that than
with a picture of an airplane?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.730
I'm going to take a slice through
that airplane's wing to

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.800
produce an airfoil section.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.480
And you may have noticed that we have
an airfoil section in our logo.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.390
The blue lines in this logo
are called streamlines.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.610
They are the key to understanding how
lift is generated on an aircraft.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.190
And what more important thing to know
than why does an airplane fly?

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.965
Also in this image is a shock wave.

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:58.370
A shock wave is the region where the
flow rapidly decelerates from

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.800
supersonic to subsonic speeds.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.819
It increases the drag significantly and
limits the flight speed that can

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.840
be achieved in an efficient
manner of an airplane.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.520
Also in this image is
the boundary layer.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.230
The boundary layer region is
where friction forces act.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.380
And those friction forces cause
a significant amount of

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.520
the drag on an airplane.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.300
Now, another part of the flow is the
wing tip vortex, over here in this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.340
purple line I've drawn in.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.160
The wing tip vortex has
a lot of energy in it.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:34.460
And we'll tell you in 16.101x how the
energy in that wake is related to the

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.190
drag on an airplane.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.130
Unfortunately, there's not too
much you can do about it.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.290
Any airplane generating lift also
creates a wake with this energy, and

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.550
therefore drag.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.450
Some of the objectives we have for
you will be for you to develop an

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.090
understanding of the fundamental
concepts of aerodynamics, things like

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.400
boundary layers, wakes, shock
waves, et cetera.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.870
We also would like you to develop an
understanding of the theoretical

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.830
models used for quantitative
aerodynamic analysis.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:14.530
In order to do that, there are
some prerequisites, though.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.870
We think you should know some vector
calculus, something about differential

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.310
equations, and some mechanics, like
you'd learn in a first physics class.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.610
If you don't feel comfortable with all
of the things I'm writing on the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.660
right-hand side, you probably should
not take this class yet, but first

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.110
brush up on your vector calculus,
differential equations, and mechanics.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.440
Another thing we think would it'd be
useful for you to know is introductory

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.570
gas dynamics, in particular,
control volumes.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.625
If you don't know that yet we will be
providing you with some materials,

00:02:47.625 --> 00:02:50.560
though, to brush up.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.510
If all that sounds great, we'd
love to have you join us

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.385
September 9 in 16.101x.
