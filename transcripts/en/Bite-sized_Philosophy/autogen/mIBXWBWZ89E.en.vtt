the second thing is what the story the

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840
the second thing is what the story the
 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
the second thing is what the story the
creation stories in Genesis for example

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850
creation stories in Genesis for example
 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.280
creation stories in Genesis for example
actually mean because they actually mean

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290
actually mean because they actually mean
 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.450
actually mean because they actually mean
something and what they mean is that

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
something and what they mean is that
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.120
something and what they mean is that
absolutely remarkable in my estimation

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130
absolutely remarkable in my estimation
 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.499
absolutely remarkable in my estimation
and so I'm going to tell you a little

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509
and so I'm going to tell you a little
 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.430
and so I'm going to tell you a little
bit about that story because it's

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440
bit about that story because it's
 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080
bit about that story because it's
necessary to understand what the story

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090
necessary to understand what the story
 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.939
necessary to understand what the story
means to determine if what Nietzsche

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949
means to determine if what Nietzsche
 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.070
means to determine if what Nietzsche
said about the inevitable destruction of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
said about the inevitable destruction of
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.099
said about the inevitable destruction of
our symbolic religious structures by

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109
our symbolic religious structures by
 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.769
our symbolic religious structures by
science was inevitable and necessary and

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779
science was inevitable and necessary and
 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929
science was inevitable and necessary and
I think the answer to that is no we just

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939
I think the answer to that is no we just
 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.730
I think the answer to that is no we just
didn't understand what the hell we were

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740
didn't understand what the hell we were
 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.680
didn't understand what the hell we were
doing any more than we really understand

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690
doing any more than we really understand
 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090
doing any more than we really understand
why we put up Christmas trees at

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100
why we put up Christmas trees at
 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.240
why we put up Christmas trees at
Christmas so we do that in part because

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250
Christmas so we do that in part because
 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.369
Christmas so we do that in part because
the Christmas tree is a symbol of life

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
the Christmas tree is a symbol of life
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.810
the Christmas tree is a symbol of life
because the tree is a symbol of life

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820
because the tree is a symbol of life
 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.299
because the tree is a symbol of life
because we inhabited trees for untold

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309
because we inhabited trees for untold
 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950
because we inhabited trees for untold
millions of years and we put lights on

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
millions of years and we put lights on
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.459
millions of years and we put lights on
the trees to symbolize the coming back

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469
the trees to symbolize the coming back
 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.590
the trees to symbolize the coming back
into the darkness of midwinter of the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600
into the darkness of midwinter of the
 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.020
into the darkness of midwinter of the
Sun and the light and so we play this

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030
Sun and the light and so we play this
 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.240
Sun and the light and so we play this
symbolic game that celebrates both life

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
symbolic game that celebrates both life
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.220
symbolic game that celebrates both life
and the emergence of light and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
and the emergence of light and
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.930
and the emergence of light and
consciousness and we associate that with

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940
consciousness and we associate that with
 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.430
consciousness and we associate that with
the birth of the Savior but we don't

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
the birth of the Savior but we don't
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680
the birth of the Savior but we don't
know that we're doing that but we do it

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690
know that we're doing that but we do it
 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.570
know that we're doing that but we do it
anyways and and we do that sort of thing

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580
anyways and and we do that sort of thing
 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.160
anyways and and we do that sort of thing
all the time because we're smarter than

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170
all the time because we're smarter than
 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.170
all the time because we're smarter than
we know and that has to be the case

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180
we know and that has to be the case
 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.910
we know and that has to be the case
because we don't know ourselves we would

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920
because we don't know ourselves we would
 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.710
because we don't know ourselves we would
need a psychology or sociology and

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
need a psychology or sociology and
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.300
need a psychology or sociology and
anthropology or any of those things if

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310
anthropology or any of those things if
 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.300
anthropology or any of those things if
we were transparent to ourselves we're

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310
we were transparent to ourselves we're
 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.450
we were transparent to ourselves we're
machines so to speak that are far more

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460
machines so to speak that are far more
 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.980
machines so to speak that are far more
intelligent and wise than the machines

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
intelligent and wise than the machines
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.530
intelligent and wise than the machines
themselves can understand and we've

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540
themselves can understand and we've
 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719
themselves can understand and we've
revealed ourselves to ourselves in our

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
revealed ourselves to ourselves in our
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.460
revealed ourselves to ourselves in our
action and our symbolic gestures

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470
action and our symbolic gestures
 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.950
action and our symbolic gestures
constantly and then have to reflect on

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960
constantly and then have to reflect on
 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.420
constantly and then have to reflect on
that to try to understand what it is

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430
that to try to understand what it is
 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.329
that to try to understand what it is
that we're up to
