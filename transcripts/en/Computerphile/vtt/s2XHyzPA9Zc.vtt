00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
The science of the block chain is already an issue.

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.720
One of the problems we're interested in, for example,

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.160
is how do you extend mobile payments

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.900
to villages in the Third World

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.620
that don't have mobile phone service

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.540
and some people suggest that

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.720
you use a block chain for this, but

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.520
that's completely infeasible

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.900
because the block chain is already several gigabytes in size

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.160
and it's growing all the time

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.420
and unless you've got a broadband connection,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.320
you basically can't play in this game.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.400
So where you've got restricted environments,

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.040
where you've got low communications,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.660
or very slowed and intermittent communications,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.080
using Bitcoin mechanisms is seriously difficult.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.300
[intro screen]

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.380
In general, the problem with Bitcoin is

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:46.100
little parts with very attractive characteristics,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.400
but it's also got some downsides.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.960
First, it doesn't have the necessary scale.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.660
Bitcoin transactions are going through

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.060
on the order of one transaction per second.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.980
But if you want to compete seriously with Visa MasterCard,

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.740
especially in the run-up to Christmas,

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.280
you need to be doing at least 1,000 times a second.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.140
Second, the sheer volumes of money

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.040
that you would need if you were to process into bank transactions,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680
for example, would be several orders of magnitude larger.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.440
Third, there are all sorts of issues around

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.060
failure and recourse.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.440
At present, if you have got a payment system,

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.420
you basically have to run a help desk,

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.180
and you have to run a fraud detection service,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.300
and an asset recovery service, and so on

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.380
so that if something goes wrong, you've got somebody to call.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.560
And that's a requirement

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.820
in your payment services directed.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.900
But Bitcoin has none of that.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.160
If someone hacks your computer and steals your Bitcoin wallet,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.480
there's nobody you can phone.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.660
The money is irretrievably gone.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.940
And so for that reason,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.940
there's some debate if Bitcoin is actually a currency at all.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.560
And I personally tend to see it simply as

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.200
something like being an industrial bearer bond.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.440
A digital equivalent to a gold coin.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.760
So the number of systems called "altcoins,"

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.340
which also use the block chain mechanism,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.800
this idea of building distributed consenseus by

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.520
getting the players in the system do some cryptographic work to find a hash,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.920
which, in turn, then, creates the distributed consensus --

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.940
So there's a number of variants of the theme that have been proposed

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.800
and some are actually used for real volume.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.940
Then, there are systems that are a little bit like traditional banking systems.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.660
The E.M.V. cards, the mobile payment systems,

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.660
which are used by payment services and operators in various parts of the world.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.500
And that has been the growth area over the past ten years.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.500
Mobile payment systems like M-Pesa in Kenya,

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.720
which use old-fashioned 1980's cryptographic methodology,

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.840
basically encrypted SMS messages,

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.040
you bring banking services to people who can benefit from them

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.020
and who are too far away from a conventional bank branch.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.760
And then there have been some exotic systems that have academic ties,

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.300
such as DigiCash,

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.920
which was invented by David Chaum in the 1980's,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.580
and that uses fancy cryptography

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.340
in order to see to it that transactions are anonymous and unlinkable.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.220
Right, so I could have a digital coin that I spend with you

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.540
and you could then spend it with somebody else

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.720
and they would have no way of telling that you got that coin from me.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.200
And that's the exact opposite of Bitcoin

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.780
and it's got its own problems.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.600
Basically, you end up having to rely on that combination of fancy cryptography and

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.320
some tamper resistance.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.060
And it's been useful so far only in a very small scale.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.800
We hear these stories of people searching "dumps for hard disks,"

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.640
because they've left in them, the Bitcoin wallet on it

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.280
and what does the wallet look like?

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.860
Is that something like the block chain itself,

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.540
is it like a small version of that, like a list of stuff, or...?

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.320
A Bitcoin wallet is simply a piece of software that

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.000
you can run on your PC or laptop or phone

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.680
which will keep track of your coins

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.640
and which will contain, critically, the cryptographic key -- the signing key --

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.580
that you use to sign over your coins to somebody else.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.800
Now, in the Bitcoin world, your identity is a public key

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.820
and public keys and private keys are generated in pairs

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.720
such that the private key is the secret you have

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.520
that can be used to sign stuff

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.160
and your public key, which is, in effect, your name in the Bitcoin system,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.920
is what anybody else can use to verify your signature.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.320
So if I pay money to you,

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.260
I don't pay money to you as a person,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.300
I pay money to the private key

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.900
that you've told me corresponds to your wallet.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.020
Professor, you're an expert in this financial world and technology, so

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.060
in your opinion, is this perhaps a template for how

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.200
things might be evolved in the future or is it --

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.620
what do you think about this as a kind of starting point?

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:56.160
Bitcoin doesn't quite work as a new global currency

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.460
for a number of reasons.

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.700
Firstly, there's the size of the block chain.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.360
Secondly, there's the delay.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:05.920
A reasonable delay to get a transaction booked

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:07.180
might be about an hour

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.960
because you have to wait for more than one hash

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.160
to be sure that the transaction has gone through and it's final.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.400
A third problem is the lack of recourse.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.980
If something goes wrong, there's nobody to phone.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.800
A fourth problem is that, over time,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.720
as the amount of money available to miners goes down,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.280
so the willingness of people who do Bitcoin mining might go down

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.300
and the system is certainly going to have to change.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.840
It may even face a crisis

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:39.100
if it's no longer possible for people to borrow money from the bank

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:41.280
in order to buy Bitcoin mining equipment

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.460
which is already beginning to be the case.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.620
So, for a number of technical reasons,

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.760
Bitcoin was a good first try at building something,

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:58.020
but we don't really know what it's successor is going to be really good at.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.100
And, to my way of thinking,

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.940
Bitcoin is a wonderful technology waiting for somebody to invent its true killer application.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.520

[from &lt;how bitcoin works&gt;]

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.820
So you start off with the last hash

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.860
plus all of the transactions that you've swept together into a pool to add to the chain,

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.920
and then put the hash that you found at the end.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.760

The problem with AI safety

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.200
is not solved,

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.060
is not going to solve itself,

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.480
and is not easy to solve.
