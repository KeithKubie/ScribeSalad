DAN GALPIN: Hi.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.241
And welcome back to The
Developer Show's coverage

00:00:09.241 --> 00:00:10.620
at GDD India.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.690
I'm Dan Galpin here
with Wayne Piekarski

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.210
to chat about the latest
from Android Things.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.884
So what is Android Things, and
how does it relate to Android?

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:19.550
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Well,
the thing with it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.960
is it's just another flavor
of Android in the same way

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.330
that you've got Android
Wear or Android TV.

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.100
It's just another
version, except it's

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.620
designed for building IoT
devices and especially

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.240
devices without screens.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.694
And you can embed it in
any kind of IoT application

00:00:32.694 --> 00:00:34.860
in the same place that you
would have used something

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.620
else before.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.375
So, yeah.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:37.875
DAN GALPIN: So what
kind of hardware

00:00:37.875 --> 00:00:39.040
does Android Things run on?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.600
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
So Android Things

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.010
runs on custom-made hardware.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.542
So I've got a little
circuit board here.

00:00:43.542 --> 00:00:45.750
So the circuit board is
based around a concept called

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.910
a system on a module, where
it's a small computing

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.790
module with the CPU, the
Wi-Fi, and the RAM on it.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.160
And that's the core part
that we provide software for,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.609
and everything else is
controllable by the developer.

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.150
So this board here
is a developer kit

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.610
which has USB, Ethernet,
and stuff like that.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.230
But you wouldn't use all of
that in a production device.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.834
So this is used for
making prototypes.

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:05.250
And then once
you're finished, you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.785
design your own custom board.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:08.160
And then you have
it manufactured

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.090
in large quantities.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.980
And it's cheap and
affordable because it

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.970
has only the components
that you need.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.780
DAN GALPIN: So what is the
system on module, or SOM,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.395
and how does it
help IoT designers?

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:19.019
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: The
thing with the SOM

00:01:19.019 --> 00:01:21.330
is it's a common module
that Google supports.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.030
So we provide the kernel,
the drivers, the libraries,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.110
everything needed.

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.730
And you don't have to do
any of the source code

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.646
or anything like that.

00:01:27.646 --> 00:01:29.160
So we provide binaries for that.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.710
And then you can focus on
making your own application.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.120
And because the SOM is
kind of a fixed design,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.640
you don't have to worry
about it changing.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.860
Everything's handled for you.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.151
DAN GALPIN: So now where does
the Android Thing project

00:01:40.151 --> 00:01:41.030
stand?

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.740
Can developers use it today?

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.820
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.610
So right now, it's
a developer preview.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.770
So you can use it for
making test devices

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.097
and trying out new ideas.

00:01:48.097 --> 00:01:49.680
And we're hoping
that next year, we're

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.890
going to be going to the
full LTS release, which

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:53.400
stands for Long Term Support.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.775
And that's going to be the
production version that you're

00:01:55.775 --> 00:01:58.350
going to be able to make devices
and push updates out too.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.270
And they're going to
be ready for consumers

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.429
to make really nice,
reliable products.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.220
We have a really good
story around updates.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.300
And our team makes
the security updates

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.770
and pushes them to the devices.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.539
So it makes devices
that are really

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.195
secure that consumers
are going to be

00:02:11.195 --> 00:02:12.430
able to have confidence in.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.200
DAN GALPIN: That's great.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.690
Now I know we recently announced
the winners of the Android

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.150
Things Hackster.io contest.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.370
Now can you tell us
about some entries that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.790
might have stood out to you?

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.930
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah.

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.790
We had a whole bunch of
really cool submissions

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:24.740
to the Hackster contest.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.180
It was actually really hard to
try to pick a winner for that.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.500
There were three really
good entrants that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.001
were awarded the prizes for it.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:31.500
Actually one of my
favorites was one

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.900
where someone built a
newsreader where you can hold it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.070
in your hands, and it was
like a Braille display,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.070
where you could use
your hands to have

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.566
news articles read to you.

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:41.190
And I really think
with Android Things,

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.020
were going to open
up possibilities

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.005
to make cool devices that are
going to help people who might

00:02:46.005 --> 00:02:48.130
not be able to type, or
might not be able to speak,

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.480
who might have vision problems
or something like that.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.140
And so people are going to
be able to make cool devices.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.750
And because they're
so easy to make,

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.708
it's going to be possible
to make more of them.

00:02:56.708 --> 00:02:58.830
Right now making custom,
specialized devices

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.060
is very expensive.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.504
And I think it's
really going to--

00:03:01.504 --> 00:03:03.420
we call it democratizing
hardware development.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.064
We want to be able to make it
so anyone can make hardware

00:03:06.064 --> 00:03:07.980
in the same way that
anyone can make software.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.150
DAN GALPIN: So I know you've
traveled the world introducing

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:11.430
developers to Android Things.

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.670
What has that been like?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.390
WAYNE PIEKARSKI:
It's been really fun.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.930
It's been great to sort of
come to events like GDD India.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.347
We have a huge
Sandbox area there.

00:03:17.347 --> 00:03:19.180
And we've had a ton of
people come up to us.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.790
And they want to
know how to do things

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:21.944
or how to build certain--

00:03:21.944 --> 00:03:22.860
they've got questions.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.571
And it's really cool to really
come here and meet people.

00:03:25.571 --> 00:03:28.070
There's only so much you can
do on social media or whatever.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.240
So it's been really great
to meet people in person,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:31.950
and spend time with
them, and find out

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.520
what they're working on.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.570
DAN GALPIN: Now
you've actually done

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.180
Codelabs where you've introduced
people to Android Things.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.230
What's that like?

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.210
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: It's really fun
because we give these kits away

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:40.350
to everyone in the room.

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.530
And they open them up,
put them all together.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.040
And some people have never done
hardware development before.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.400
I mean a lot of
software developers,

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.540
they write software.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.715
But then with the
kits, you realize

00:03:50.715 --> 00:03:52.590
this is something you
can pull apart and play

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.737
with and experiment with.

00:03:53.737 --> 00:03:56.070
It's kind of like playing
with toys when you're a child.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:57.770
You can build things and
assemble it yourself.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.561
So it's really fun to
watch people do that.

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:01.200
And they leave
the Codelab going,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.460
wow, I can use the camera, run
TensorFlow on it, and use it.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.040
And it works.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.100
And now I can take it home
and build some cool project

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.850
that they're trying to work on.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.390
So, yeah.

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.220
DAN GALPIN: Where can developers
go for more information

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.140
about Android Things?

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.630
WAYNE PIEKARSKI: Yeah.

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.629
So the best place is the
Android developer site.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.100
So developer.android.com/things.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.589
And all of our documentation's
there, the set-up guides,

00:04:19.589 --> 00:04:21.100
samples, and so forth.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.890
And that's a really great way
to get started and sort of learn

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:23.974
more about Android Things.

00:04:23.974 --> 00:04:24.806
DAN GALPIN: Awesome.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.890
Thank you so much, Wayne,
for joining us today.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.350
Now visit the description
below if you'd

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.270
like to find out how to get
started with your own Android

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.936
Things projects.

00:04:30.936 --> 00:04:33.530
