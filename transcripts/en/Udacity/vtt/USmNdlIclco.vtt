00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
If you have a probability here you're trying to estimate--and here is the empirical mean--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
with few data points--you might have a very right confidence interval--but as data increases,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
the boundary of the confidence interval will move inward.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Let me contrast to this with a concept that we encountered previously,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
which is the standard deviation.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Suppose you increase the sample size N, how would you expect the standard deviation

00:00:25.000 --> 99:59:59.000
of the sample to change--will it grow, shrink or stay about the same?
