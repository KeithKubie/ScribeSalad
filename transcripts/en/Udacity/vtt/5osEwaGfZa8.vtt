00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
Welcome back!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is unit 4 of programming languages, and if we turn the clock back to last time,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
we were posed the following question.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Given a string S, like a webpage or some embedded JavaScript or any program,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and a formal grammar describing our desired language,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a former grammar for HTML or JavaScript,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we want to know if that string S is in the language of G?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
To do this, we use 2 key techniques--lexical analysis, which broke the string down

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
into a stream of tokens, and syntactic analysis or parsing,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
which takes a string of tokens and checks to see if they adhere to,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
if they conform to a context-free grammar.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
While we're on the subject of time and grammars--grammars that may possibly

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
be ambiguous, let me introduce you to a phrase that you may not have run into yet.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The phrase is, "Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana."

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The ambiguity trick here is that time is a noun, flies is a verb--time flies--

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
and "like an arrow" is the modification.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
So here I've got time flying.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You can tell because it's got labels, and those labels are always to be trusted.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
So you might think, based on parallel structure, that fruit is a noun and verb is flies.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So here I've got a picture of an apple with wings,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and their flying in the manner of a banana.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
But in fact, fruit flies is the noun.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
They are little insects that go after fruit, and this time, like is the verb.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Fruit flies go after the banana. They enjoy the banana.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is the sort of ambiguity that we can run into in a natural language like English.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
We're going to have to deal with that same sort of issue in programming languages,

00:01:43.000 --> 09:59:59.000
like in JavaScript or Python.
