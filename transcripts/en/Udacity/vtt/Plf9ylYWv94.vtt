00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.610
Let's now have a look at the object oriented architecture style and

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.680
its relationship to maintainability.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.700
The object oriented architecture style is a very powerful way of

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.080
organizing a system.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.580
And maintainability is significantly increased when using this style,

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.360
because of the independence of the components, both their encapsulated data and

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.290
the hands-off, message passing style of interaction.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.950
On the other hand, objects will have to refer to each other.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.040
Okay? There needs to be some way of identifying other objects in the system.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.930
This can increase the intercomponent dependencies,

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.450
thereby reducing maintainability.
