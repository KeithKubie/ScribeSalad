ANNA PATTERSON: Now I want to
introduce Johanna Wright.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:06.780
She's the Lead Product Manager
of Search for many years,

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.380
launching such innovations as
Universal Search, Instant, and

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.250
the Knowledge Graph.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.500
And now she's leading up Search
in Android, including

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.392
Google Now, Voice Search,
and Speech.

00:00:19.392 --> 00:00:27.740
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.720
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Let's step
back to January 2003.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.790
At this point in time,
I'm living in my

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.500
father in-law's house.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.760
He's put a nice curtain up for
my section of the living room,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.380
where my husband and I share
an air mattress.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.740
The sun streams in.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.880
6:00 AM we wake up every
morning because of the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.610
unbearable Orange County heat.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.790
Air mattress is popped,
and I'm unemployed.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.930
Just six months earlier, I was a
young tech exec in New York,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.400
first during the dot-com
boom and then bust.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.760
But my company that I worked at
had finally shut its doors.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.730
And my husband and I decided
to get on our bicycles and

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.990
ride across the country
to lovely, sunny LA.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.520
Riding across the country
with your new

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.820
husband is a lot of fun.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.980
Showing up in LA, a new city,
with no job, not so much fun.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.850
Then the rejection letters from
business schools started

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.750
pouring in.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.250
And it's January, and there's
only one business school I

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.110
haven't heard back from.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.690
But I'm not feeling too
optimistic because they're

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.020
supposed to interview all of
their candidates, and they're

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.760
going to mail out their verdict
two days later, and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.260
they still haven't
interviewed me.

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.130
But then I got an email from
UCLA that said we want to

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.780
interview you.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.160
And since my confidence had been
shot, my response was,

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.800
"You do?" I was fortunate enough
to get to go to UCLA

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.380
for business school, and then
I got a job at Google.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.130
And today I'm going to talk
about my career starting out

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.420
at Google and what it was like
to be a Product Manager at

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.280
Google and give some bits
of advice about product

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.850
management.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.110
But my first piece of career
advice is that your career is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.640
not going to be linear.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.010
Expect to be disrupted.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.600
This is a disruptive industry,
and you, too, may someday be

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.340
unemployed on your
father-in-law's couch.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.140
What's really going to matter is
the energy and the tenacity

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.500
with which you pick yourself
up and take

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.430
on your next adventure.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.970
OK, so let's jump into Google.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.660
I was hired to be a Product
Manager working in Search.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.840
My boss gave me two
options of jobs.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.260
One was something called
Universal Search.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.310
Universal Search was the project
where we took all the

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.000
content from our different
back ends--

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.580
maps, videos, images--

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.340
and we put them in the main
search results pane.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.310
The other option that she gave
me was to do something called

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.770
Premium Content Search.

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.630
This is where we searched all
the content behind pay walls

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.300
and put it in the
search results.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.710
Both these things seemed pretty
interesting, and I was

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.010
so new to Google, I didn't have
any context or judgment

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.830
to make a decision.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.030
Fortunately for me, I had gone
to the same business school as

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.450
Susan Wojcicki, my fellow
panelist, and so I asked her

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.810
for some advice.

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.630
Susan looked at me like
I had two heads.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:21.040
What?

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.960
Of course you should do
Universal Search.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.370
That's our business, Johanna.

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.430
So this leads to another
piece of career wisdom.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.590
What does a good opportunity
look like?

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:32.560
Well, a good opportunity
looks like

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.980
something that's strategic.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.310
If you're doing something
that's in line with the

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.785
company's mission and it has
not been done before, well,

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:42.590
then it's very likely to
be a good opportunity.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.900
OK, so let me jump into
Universal Search.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.070
This was 2005 at Google.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.490
Google was growing like crazy.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.180
It was very chaotic.

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.580
And it's kind of
hard to know--

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.790
for me it was hard to know how
projects got assigned, what

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.910
you're working on.

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.480
And I got paired up with an
infrastructure team while I

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.550
was working on Universal
Search.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:07.200
This was a great team, but a
team that was very focused on

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.110
building infrastructure,
and they didn't want

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:10.590
to build any features.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.750
And I was a Product Manager, and
I was being judged on the

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.740
features that I launched.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.480
And so it was pretty stressful,
because I wasn't

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.339
delivering anything.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:22.240
And so what I ended up doing was
creating a set of mocks, a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.130
series of mocks of what
Universal Search could look

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.880
like, and then I created a
little PowerPoint deck, and I

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.900
walked around Google, and I
introduced myself to anyone

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:32.720
who looked like they might want
to be a Features Tech

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:35.890
Lead to see if they wanted
to join my project.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.950
And I was fortunate enough to
meet a person named David

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.860
Bailey, who wanted to join on
and lead the features side of

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.220
the effort.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.720
And then the project really
started to get legs.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.290
So here's the beginning of my
product management specific

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.180
advice, and that is
to paint a vision.

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.920
Once you paint a vision and you
share your vision, people

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:56.410
will follow.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.310
It'll be a lot easier to follow
once you have a vision.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.670
OK, so David and I started.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.900
There was a big mountain
in front of us.

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.030
We didn't really know
what to do.

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.050
This project had failed a
number of times before.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:10.080
We didn't really know
why it had failed.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.040
And I had this idea that we
should do a user study.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:16.150
Just trying to figure out what
to do, we said, well, let's

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:17.720
just do a user study.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.170
So we pulled together
a prototype

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:20.710
to do our user study.

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.900
And once we had this prototype,
the people around

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:27.620
us in Google started to be
able to imagine that this

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.860
product might come to life and
that something might happen.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:34.510
And so this brings me to my
second piece of product

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:37.150
management advice, which is that
if you don't really know

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.900
what to do, you should
just do something.

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.540
Do something to move
the ball forward.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.440
I was very fortunate, though,
that a user study was what we

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.750
decided to do, because
people loved it.

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:53.670
And it was so awesome.

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:56.590
We learned that the project
and the product had legs.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.320
So I remember sitting in the
labs, and it was in the spring

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.690
of 2006, for our user study.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:03.920
And one of the searches
we asked people to

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.530
do was Barry Bonds.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.340
Now, this was a long time ago.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.210
This was the Dark Ages.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:11.090
YouTube was just starting out.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.660
But there was a home video that
someone had uploaded of

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.210
Barry Bonds tying Babe Ruth's
home run record.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.310
And the participant in our
study, she clicked on the

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.060
video, she watched the ball sail
out into the field, and

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.140
she had this big smile
on her face.

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.830
It wasn't unnatural at all that
she saw this video in the

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:32.540
search results.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.910
So we knew the project
had legs, and it was

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:38.870
just a great moment.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:43.070
So my final and most important
piece of product management

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.580
advice is to listen
to your users.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.120
And even more importantly, use
your products yourself.

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.170
Just this weekend when I was
using Android Search, I

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.820
noticed that speech recognition
is slow, like

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.490
maybe one in seven times.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.750
I don't know why, but I'm
really glad that we're

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:01.582
investing in speed.

00:07:01.582 --> 00:07:04.250
Then I also had some magical
experiences with Google Now.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.590
So I was invited to go to a
birthday party in Burlingame,

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.890
and Google Now reminded
me about the party.

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:12.040
And it even told me that
Burlingame was 30 minutes from

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:16.180
my house, which I didn't know,
and it was super helpful.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.270
The more you use your products,
the easier it is to

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.290
make decisions and to have an
intuitive feel for what you

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.540
should be doing.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.360
So let's summarize my product
management advice.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.858
One, paint a vision.

00:07:29.858 --> 00:07:32.510
Two, when you don't know what
to do, just make mini

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:33.240
milestones.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.380
Roll that ball forward.

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.930
And three, use your products.

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.120
Since this is a Women's
Techmakers event, I thought

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.450
I'd close with my very
own lean-in story.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.950
So back when all this Universal
Search stuff was

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.880
going on, I ended up
getting pregnant.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.700
And when I was eight months
pregnant, my boss, Marissa

00:07:55.700 --> 00:08:00.020
Mayer, suggested that I lead a
team of senior engineers to

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:03.060
come up with the search strategy
for the next year.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.680
Now, the search strategy, the
process, the normal process,

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.690
was to set this meeting in
mid-November, but my baby was

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:14.000
supposed to be born at
the end of October.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.620
And they're like, hey, no
problem, we'll just

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.480
move the date up.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:22.840
Didn't give me very much time
to prepare, and my baby was

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:23.670
something that you
call transverse.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:27.130
So he's lying on his side, and
I had to have a C-section.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.666
So they moved the date up.

00:08:28.666 --> 00:08:31.360
I moved my C-section to the
very last possible date.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.960
We met in the middle.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:36.800
And on Wednesday, I gave the
strategy presentation.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.195
On Thursday, I had my baby.

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:44.720
Now, this might be horrifying
to some of you, but to me it

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.850
was invigorating.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:48.280
And it set me up to have a
leadership role in Search when

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:51.670
I returned from my leave.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.590
And the point I want you to take
away is not that you need

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.900
to sacrifice your family
for your career.

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:59.510
I feel fortunate enough that
I haven't had to do that.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:02.080
You see, there was no question
in my mind that given that

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.290
opportunity, I would want to
give that presentation.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:09.990
And it was really huge that
my manager believed in me.

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.340
So the takeaway that I'd like
us to take is that as

00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:16.010
managers, we shouldn't assume
people's abilities or desires.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.500
We should ask.

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:20.120
As managers, it's our job to
enable greatness in our teams.
