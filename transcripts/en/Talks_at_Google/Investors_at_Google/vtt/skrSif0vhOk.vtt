MALE SPEAKER: Hello,
and welcome everyone

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.824
to another episode of our
Value investing Series.

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:10.620
We have a very special
guest with us today.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.090
So in thinking about
introducing him,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:18.270
I have to start off with
a series of experiments,

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.000
a series of studies
that were done

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.820
at Stanford by the
professor Walter

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.130
Mischel in 1960s and '70s.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.980
These are also most widely known
as the Stanford Marshmallow

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.830
Experiment that you
might have heard of.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.310
Essentially, it
was an experiment.

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.810
It was basically a bunch of
studies in which children were

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:43.350
offered a choice between
one small reward provided

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.480
immediately, or two small
rewards if they waited

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.150
for a short period, which was
about 15 minutes, during which

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.870
the tester would leave
the room and then return.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.160
The reward was sometimes
a marshmallow, but often

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.310
a cookie or a pretzel.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.710
In followup studies, what
these researchers found

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.930
was very surprising.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.430
These children who were able to
wait longer for the preferred

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.670
rewards tended to have
better life outcomes

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.170
as measured by SAT scores,
educational attainment, body

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.040
mass index, and
other life measures.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.470
Now why am I mentioning this?

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.780
Our guest today is no
psychology professor.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.190
But he happens to
be a Stanford alum.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.490
And he happens to be a
world famous value investor.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.810
In speaking about his investing
process and philosophy,

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.440
you will see parallels
between delayed gratification.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.810
Let me share a quote
from his recent interview

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.320
with all of you.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.860
He describes his
process saying, "We

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.840
tend to benefit in life when
we sacrifice something today

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.070
to gain something tomorrow.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.540
That is true for companies.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.790
That is true for individuals."

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.440
His focus, he says,
is on businesses

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.449
that have the capacity to
suffer, that is, they can

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:13.590
reinvest their capital
at high rates of return

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.120
so that the wealth will
continue to compound

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.150
into years into the future.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.190
Thomas Russo, our guest,
is a preeminent investor

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:28.800
of our times who began his
investing journey in 1982

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.390
after an encounter
that changed his life.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.380
He was studying law and
business as a graduate student

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.350
at Stanford when Warren Buffett
came to address his investment

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.060
class.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.560
As Mr. Russo explained
in a recent interview,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.350
he was dazzled by the
speed of Buffett's mind,

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.980
his quirky delivery,
and his beguiling

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.050
habit of courting everyone from
Bertrand Russell to Yogi Berra

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.020
and the wisdom of his
deeply thought ideas.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.460
This inspired him to finding
his own investment vehicle

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.730
and starting his value
investing journey.

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.630
We are so glad that
he's here in person

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.910
to share his experience
and his journey

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.090
and his insights
with all of us here.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.410
Thank you for coming.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.720
So without any further
ado, ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.494
please join me in welcoming
the one and only Thomas Russo.

00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:30.124
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:30.124 --> 00:03:31.790
THOMAS RUSSO: I'm so
pleased to be here.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.154
I actually thought
the setting would

00:03:34.154 --> 00:03:35.320
be a much different setting.

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:41.050
I thought we'd be underground
in some catacombs with a group

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.430
of people worshipping
an outlawed

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.770
faith in Silicon Valley, the
faith of value investing.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.280
But here we are, next
to the free food,

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.520
the wonderfully lit
room, great chairs.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.870
So being a zealot in the
investment business today

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170
doesn't bear the marks
that it did 2000 years ago

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.460
for religious zealots, I guess.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.910
It's a great honor to be
here, especially at this time.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.810
It's a really good excuse to
get away from the markets, which

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.210
is something that's welcome.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.560
Even though I say that, we've
had an unusual period of time

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.940
which reaffirms what
[? Surapa ?] described

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.720
as this value investing
preference for businesses that

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.360
have the capacity to
suffer, because you think

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.060
about my last three years,
we've certainly suffered when

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.560
compared to the S&amp;P 500, which
has been elevated by sort

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.917
of global capital flows.

00:04:36.917 --> 00:04:39.000
And we've had businesses
that, right through this,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.730
have been investing in
their strong global brands,

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.760
but showing a modest growth
at the reporting level

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.450
because they often invest a
portion of their net profits

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.880
against future
business prospects.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.330
Now recently, almost a third of
our portfolios in beverages--

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.820
and the world is now quite
reaffirmed about the value

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.080
of beverage brands through
the noise about the AB InBev

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.590
acquisition of SABMiller--
we own both those shares,

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.260
and it's helped generate
performance recently

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.810
in the face of a
plunging market.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.520
And then I was reminded
of this again today, which

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.770
was the results of an
announcement by JT Tobacco

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:29.590
to acquire American Spirit
from Reynolds American Tobacco.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.970
Well, quite
extraordinarily, the price

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.890
was almost Silicon Valley-like.

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.160
It was 300 times
operating income

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.265
for a business-- they paid
$5 billion for a business

00:05:40.265 --> 00:05:43.850
that I think had around
$500 million in revenue,

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.780
much smaller base of
profits because it's still

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.790
investing in its own growth.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.750
But they saw something that they
could take around the world.

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:57.660
And it reaffirms-- within
a business like RJR,

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.340
where people often
overlook the investment

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.739
because it lacks sizzle-- that
the strength of the brand,

00:06:04.739 --> 00:06:06.780
the predictability of cash
flow, and the ability,

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.570
most importantly, to reinvest
that cash flow going forward--

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:11.080
leaves it quite valuable.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.060
I'm going to come over here so
I can move some of these around.

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.170
I did, in fact, also
welcome the chance

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:19.990
to come up because
I'll talk tomorrow

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.390
to the students in Professor
Jack McDonald's class, which

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.310
I've done for the
past 25 years, having

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:25.590
graduated from his class.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:28.220
And it was there that
Buffettt came to our class

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.160
and provided some
early insights.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.640
I'll go through a
couple of quick slides.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.160
As an investor, you're always,
at least in the value investing

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.040
world, encouraged to
invest for the long term

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.220
and let market disruptions
pass you by, hold on.

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.090
And I was reminded of
this in June of 2008,

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:51.610
when I was in Africa with
my family on a safari.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.970
And every day we'd go
out to visit the range

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.610
and look for animals.

00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:58.080
Each one looks more
ferocious than the next.

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.150
And every single time,
the guide would say, look,

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.110
if you're ever separated from
the group, and you're alone,

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.280
and you're being charged
by a lion or anything

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.080
else-- a chameleon,
anything that

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:11.719
might come at you-- freeze,
and it'll ignore you,

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:12.510
run right past you.

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:14.380
But if you run,
they'll chase you down.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.370
That was the rule again
and again and again.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.300
Finally we came upon this guy.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.650
And he said that,
that's a Cape Buffalo.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:23.620
If ever you're alone and
you're separated from the group

00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:27.860
and you see one coming
charging at you, run like hell.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.020
And so that happened
in June of 2008,

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.950
when the market was
just in free fall.

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.180
And at the time, I sort
of felt like maybe we

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.280
should run like hell.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.880
We didn't, and we haven't.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:40.380
It's my belief,
it's been my belief,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:42.770
that equities are
the preferred form

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:48.100
of investing for one capable
of enduring short-term pain

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.110
for long-term gain.

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.120
Equities will be the
best way to do that.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.110
And along that
line, I would just

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.526
want to make a point about
this other Stanford experiment

00:07:55.526 --> 00:07:56.400
that you referred to.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.310
I do believe definitely in
deferral in the investment

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.640
world-- as you can see,
a little less as it

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.730
comes to marshmallows.

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.150
I tend to grab the big
ones and eat them quickly.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:09.490
But the principle's the same.

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.130
In fact, I incorporate
the principle in one

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:14.250
of the early
lessons that Buffett

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.890
gave at an annual meeting
of Berkshire, where he said,

00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:20.710
you know, really, investing is
as simple as "Aesop's Fable."

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:25.370
It's about the bird in hand
versus the bird in the bush.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.590
The only thing you need to
know-- because you know what

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:31.290
you have-- what you need to
know, which is uncertain,

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:33.490
is what you'll end up with when.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.730
And he says, it's
as easy is that,

00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:39.380
and then he says,
it's as hard as that.

00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:41.720
I'm in an audience at Google.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.850
And I think I read
that the minutes spent

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.850
on YouTube in the last second
quarter versus the prior year

00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:52.170
was up 60%, and that's
on a million users.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:55.730
And I can tell you that if you
keep up that type of growth

00:08:55.730 --> 00:08:56.980
rate, it won't take that long.

00:08:56.980 --> 00:08:59.229
You'll know what you're going
to have, which is a lot,

00:08:59.229 --> 00:09:01.050
and it's going to happen soon.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.670
But in most
businesses you're not

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.410
blessed with 60% growth rates.

00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.830
There's something
much less commanding.

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:11.930
But it is about what
you'll end up with.

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.740
And so I think
that's a good emblem.

00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.720
This I take from one of
our largest holdings,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:18.870
which is Nestle.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:23.490
They, like Google,
talk extensively

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:26.550
about corporate
culture, because that

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.855
is what you can bank on
when you make an investment.

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:34.880
We own businesses
that are supposed

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:36.540
to reproduce
themselves over time,

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.020
and you need a strong culture.

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:42.270
And the head of Nestle's Japan
business once showed this slide

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.660
and remarked about
how lovely he thought

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.340
that 700-year-old temple was.

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:50.320
And then he said, now, none
of the wood's 700 years old,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.080
but the temple is.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:54.490
And I thought of that as
sort of an apt metaphor

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:55.874
for what businesses are like.

00:09:55.874 --> 00:09:58.040
I mean, none of you will
be at Google at some point,

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.599
but Google will hopefully
still be Google.

00:10:00.599 --> 00:10:02.140
The timbers are all
changed out here,

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.765
but it still stands
for the same thing.

00:10:03.765 --> 00:10:07.600
And you'll be a very different
company when you're all gone.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:09.510
But Google should
still stand, in light

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.450
of its context at that
time, as a business

00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:14.680
with the same virtues and
values as it is today.

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.230
And that corporate
culture is extraordinarily

00:10:17.230 --> 00:10:21.970
important to myself because
most of the money that I oversee

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:25.430
is invested through me by
wealthy families, family

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.360
offices.

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:29.580
And for them, it helps
a lot to hold a business

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:30.480
for a very long time.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.470
And the only way
you can invest based

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:36.520
on that belief is if you get
the corporate culture right

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.160
I came out of Warren Buffett's
visit to my class in 1982

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.580
at Stanford Business School
with a couple of sets

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.750
of information captured here.

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.670
First, the $0.50 dollar bill.

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:50.830
That used to be the
old-fashioned way of thinking

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:51.850
about value investing.

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.280
If you buy $0.50 dollar bill,
your margin of safety was quite

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.640
great because of the discount.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.970
Your internal rate of return,
however, depended exactly

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:04.554
on when that discount closed.

00:11:04.554 --> 00:11:06.970
And if it closed in a year,
you'd make 100% on your money.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.960
If it took 10 years, you'd
make 7% on your money,

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.020
and so on through
the Rule of 72.

00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:18.320
It's also problematic
because it's taxable.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:22.050
So in that old model, if
you took that $0.50 dollar

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:25.450
and realized the dollar,
you'd pay 40% tax on that now

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:28.814
because long term gains
have been less favored.

00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:30.230
And you have to
redeploy the money

00:11:30.230 --> 00:11:31.700
into finding something else.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.920
That didn't seem like
much of a thoughtful way

00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.150
to conduct affairs
from my perspective,

00:11:36.150 --> 00:11:38.180
especially since,
at business school,

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:43.230
Warren gave the class
the primary benefit.

00:11:43.230 --> 00:11:44.940
He talked about
the only one thing

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.510
that the government gives
you as an investor, which

00:11:47.510 --> 00:11:50.493
is the non-taxation
of unrealized gains.

00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:51.993
They give you one
other thing, which

00:11:51.993 --> 00:11:55.022
is that you can deduct
losses for tax purposes.

00:11:55.022 --> 00:11:56.480
But you don't you
want to go there.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.650
You're much better
off finding something

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.040
that you could hold so that the
gains that you get over time

00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:03.500
are unrealized.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:06.080
So when he spoke at
our class, Berkshire

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.370
traded at $900 a share.

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:11.020
Today it's at $200,000 a share.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.145
It's never paid a dividend.

00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:14.570
It's never done anything
except compound.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:18.020
And it's only because
he's been able to reinvest

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.660
at such a high rate internally.

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:24.680
And rather than try to close the
discount, the discount that we

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:27.430
started with, he just
let the intrinsic value

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.530
compound and the market price
will track it over time.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:32.570
It

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:34.760
Warren also said
that there aren't

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.990
that many good
businesses in the world.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.060
As an investor you
should select a business

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.330
that you find interesting
so you would follow it

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.310
and you spend more time with it.

00:12:43.310 --> 00:12:47.480
For me, that was
consumer brands.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:52.680
Early Buffett
investing was sort of

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:56.810
transformed once Berkshire
bought See's Chocolate

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:57.830
in the early '70s.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:13:01.280
And I heard from him
early into that exercise,

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.700
but he already had realized
that See's gave him the ability

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:08.050
to raise prices regularly,
because the consumer doesn't

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:12.760
believe that there's an adequate
substitute for the brands

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:15.420
that they embrace.

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.010
I recognized that once
flying on an airplane,

00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:21.050
and the person next to me
ordered a Jack Daniels.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:23.680
The steward said, sorry, we
just have Jim Beam, and he said,

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.869
I'll have water.

00:13:24.869 --> 00:13:26.285
I'd rather have
water than the one

00:13:26.285 --> 00:13:28.910
that I don't really
identify with.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.210
And that brand
loyalty, by the way,

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:34.060
is what we look for at the
heart of our businesses.

00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.230
That gives pricing power, that
gives predictability of demand.

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:41.960
In fact, it's that brand
loyalty that, at some point,

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.820
you guys are involved with
creating and sustaining

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:48.960
through all of the work
that happens at Google.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.412
But that's the sort
of uber brand value

00:13:51.412 --> 00:13:52.870
rather than the
search brand value.

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:54.328
So we can talk
about that later on,

00:13:54.328 --> 00:13:57.130
because I'm intrigued by Google.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.130
So what did Warren say?

00:13:58.130 --> 00:14:01.800
He said margin of
safety's required.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:06.410
The $0.50 dollar bill, however,
changed by the time I met him,

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.924
because he realized that a
business that can price has

00:14:08.924 --> 00:14:11.340
the ability to grow, and that
growth is more powerful than

00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.990
discounts of inert value.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:18.900
He said, observe the tax
efficiency of holding.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.850
And then he said,
you're probably

00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:24.757
going to have to find managers
who are owner-minded if you're

00:14:24.757 --> 00:14:27.090
going to hold for a long time,
because otherwise they'll

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.270
steal from you.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.610
So the question is agency
costs, and that's actually

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:33.870
at the heart of the
investment contract

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.460
that you have with your
public company managers.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.620
There is a contract that
says, you'll have the use

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:41.015
of my money, my
investors' money,

00:14:41.015 --> 00:14:42.890
but you have to treat
it as if it's your own.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.760
You can't prefer your
returns to their returns.

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.420
That's very hard to find.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.210
And so in my world, where
I found it to be available

00:14:52.210 --> 00:14:55.690
is through
family-controlled companies

00:14:55.690 --> 00:15:00.000
where the family exercise
dominion on their own rights

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.330
over the management to do
what's right for the next 10

00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:06.040
generations of the family.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.010
That's starts to feel
comfortable to me because

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.320
of my long-term mindedness.

00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.710
I like businesses that invest
for the very longest term,

00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:16.810
and do so with the owner in
mind rather than management.

00:15:16.810 --> 00:15:22.840
The average US public
company, by contrast,

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.450
has no family entanglements.

00:15:25.450 --> 00:15:26.430
It's purely public.

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.050
There's absolutely no
image of a shareholder

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:34.340
when people think
about the contract.

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:38.120
I actually met the CFO
of Coca Cola recently,

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.020
and she referred to shareholders
as stakeholders, and I said,

00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:42.977
don't you really mean owners?

00:15:42.977 --> 00:15:44.560
Because the word
stakeholder-- I mean,

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:46.810
you could be a stakeholder
if you're the community,

00:15:46.810 --> 00:15:48.060
if you're this or you're that.

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:49.960
There are all these concepts.

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.460
But in business, what you really
want your agents to think about

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.890
is the owner at some level.

00:15:56.890 --> 00:15:58.641
Public companies
are so far removed

00:15:58.641 --> 00:15:59.890
from that it's not even funny.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.500
Really, it's the idea of how do
you make the public company's

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.310
money manage its money?

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:09.860
The most efficient way designed
to do that are stock options.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:12.090
And stock options
have one problem,

00:16:12.090 --> 00:16:16.550
which is the only work over
a specific period of time,

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.570
after which, if the
prices isn't struck,

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.670
they end up being worthless.

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:24.240
So the one thing
public companies

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.230
start to spend an awful
lot of time caring

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:28.800
about, way too much, is time.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.190
They need it now.

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.310
And in fact, Wall
Street loves companies

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:35.680
that are willing to present
things early on because it

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.595
means that they can predict more
clearly what the world's going

00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:43.790
to look like than what natural
outcomes ought to allow.

00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:48.870
So they can say, General Mills
is going to earn $1.50 this

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:52.970
quarter, and General Mills
will earn $1.50 this quarter.

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:55.154
They won't really earn
it, but they'll report it.

00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:57.070
And they'll do that again
and again and again.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:16:59.810
And then over time,
by taking steps

00:16:59.810 --> 00:17:02.160
that get the outcome,
to meet the target,

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.069
to keep the share price up--
because there's no volatility,

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:09.197
it's all predictable-- they
hollow out the franchise.

00:17:09.197 --> 00:17:11.030
Just the opposite of
what we're looking for.

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:12.405
We're looking for
businesses that

00:17:12.405 --> 00:17:16.589
are willing to completely
thrash the near term in pursuit

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:17.849
of the long term.

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:19.300
But in order to
do that, they have

00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:22.490
to have security in one
issue, which is control.

00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:24.339
That's where the
family-controlled company

00:17:24.339 --> 00:17:29.450
comes into play, because they
can, with their super vote,

00:17:29.450 --> 00:17:34.920
defend against the pressures
that normal managements are

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:38.400
willing to assume in
the complicit bargain

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.350
that they have with stock
option-driven compensation.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.780
I'll fast forward for a second.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:46.140
I pulled this from the
Google founding principles.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:49.420
And right at the heart of
what Google talks about,

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.750
and what I think gives
you such endurance,

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:57.120
is this structure, this
third paragraph down,

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.910
second sentence. "This
structure will also

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:00.860
make it easier for
our management team

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.910
to follow the long-term
innovative approach emphasized

00:18:03.910 --> 00:18:05.810
earlier."

00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:08.950
They have the
management's back covered,

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:12.360
and they allow, from that
standpoint-- investments have

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:15.750
a very long payback,
but upfront burden

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:18.960
to take place at full
amounts, because it's

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:22.290
my belief that most public
companies, the error

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.530
is on under-investment
upfront to make sure

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:31.590
that the results are,
in effect, overstated.

00:18:31.590 --> 00:18:33.610
Now I use the term
capacity to suffer.

00:18:33.610 --> 00:18:34.670
It's a funny one.

00:18:34.670 --> 00:18:37.710
It was partly derived
from another investor

00:18:37.710 --> 00:18:39.490
you may have met with
or heard of called

00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:42.910
Jean-Marie Eveillard, who runs
SoGen's International Fund.

00:18:42.910 --> 00:18:44.890
He was quite an early
international investor.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.600
And at a Columbia
function I was at,

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:48.920
the business school,
somebody asked him

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:51.790
what he looked for in
analysts when he was hiring

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:53.730
to build as investment team.

00:18:53.730 --> 00:18:57.710
And without a moment, he
said, the capacity to suffer.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.500
And I thought that was an
appropriate definition.

00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:04.930
And the reason he said that
is that it's so rare to find

00:19:04.930 --> 00:19:07.240
that in America,
because as a country,

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.230
we always think that every
single day should be better

00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.490
than the prior day.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.360
Actually, there's a
great quote in the book

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.250
that I just read, "Work Rules."

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:21.010
And he talks about a guy who
was in a cubicle, and he said,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:25.190
every day of his life is
worse than the day before.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:26.440
That's the capacity to suffer.

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:32.940
But in the investment world,
the capacity to suffer

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.030
is hard to find.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:39.610
People expect returns to
come easily, regularly,

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:40.450
and they don't.

00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:43.190
And so his recognition
was that you

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.840
have to have people
in the investment

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:49.260
business
constitutionally prepared

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:52.690
to have deferred results.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:53.190
All right.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:55.300
So if we start out
believing that we're

00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.190
going to hold something
for a very long time, what

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.350
it needs to have is the
capacity to reinvest internally.

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.410
For me, I used consumer
brands as the industry

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.330
through which I invest because
they tend to be very enduring.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.570
You think about Communist China.

00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.860
After the veil lifted and
commerce could go back in,

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:19.960
the number one cigarette in
Communist China the next day

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.300
was a cigarette that
hadn't been in the country

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.040
for 55 years of Communism.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.440
It was the old British
American tobacco

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.300
brand called State Express 555.

00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:32.310
Hadn't been in the market,
but somehow it was still

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:34.770
in the brains of the consumer.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:38.270
Same thing with Romania when
the wall went down in Romania.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.570
The number one thing
that the Romanians wanted

00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:42.260
was Chesterfield cigarettes.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.250
Well, you can't even
find them anymore.

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:49.750
But that brand endured for 55
years in the consumer psyche.

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:53.160
And what we look
for is the ability

00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.810
to reinvest behind those brands.

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:59.490
The strength of the
brands tend to allow

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:02.540
for more regular free cash flow
because of the pricing power

00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:03.730
that you get.

00:21:03.730 --> 00:21:07.070
The likelihood of finding
owner-minded businesses

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.730
goes up with consumer
brands because they

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:13.380
tend to have been, over the
life of the company, more

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.020
self-funding.

00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.100
You think about why it is that
most American companies don't

00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:20.170
end up with control
shareholders,

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.940
because if you're in
a crummy business,

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.340
it takes a lot of money to grow.

00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:28.170
And you have to raise
additional equity again

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:29.955
and again and again
to fund the growth.

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.630
And at the end, if it's a
sufficiently competitive crummy

00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:37.840
business, you're going to have
horrible results and no control

00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:38.890
shareholder.

00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:41.250
The presence of a
business that still

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:45.590
has control held by the family
is an evidence of the fact

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:48.640
that the business is, at its
heart, quite cash generative.

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:51.850
Now it's not enough just
to be cash generative.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.960
What you really want
is to have the capacity

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.910
to have that cash that the
mature markets deliver,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.890
in the world of consumer brands,
available for reinvestment

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:05.660
globally where 95% of the
world exists in population,

00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:08.620
and where GDPs are
escalating, and where

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.020
consumer disposable
income is just growing.

00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.500
And so we want to have brands
that have relevance abroad,

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:19.300
which gives them the capacity
to reinvest mature market cash

00:22:19.300 --> 00:22:21.670
flows into growing markets.

00:22:21.670 --> 00:22:24.630
It leads this portfolio
that I oversee

00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:27.880
to be primarily European.

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.050
That's for a couple reasons.

00:22:29.050 --> 00:22:34.100
One, the European managements
aren't nearly so accustomed

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:37.360
to compensation based
on equity options.

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:39.690
And so this notion of
having to do something

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.950
quickly-- and fabricate
numbers to make sure

00:22:42.950 --> 00:22:45.574
that the Wall Street
analysts are pleased enough

00:22:45.574 --> 00:22:47.740
to keep the stock price
high enough for your options

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.950
to be worth something--
doesn't exist over there.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.550
They pay people cash.

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:59.700
The brands that exists in
Europe have been abroad more

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:03.700
historically, and hence are
more embedded in the culture.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:07.460
In India you have
Hindustan Lever.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.170
Well, that's Unilever.

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:11.580
You have Cadbury of India.

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.770
That's Cadbury Schweppes.

00:23:12.770 --> 00:23:14.690
You have Nestle of India.

00:23:14.690 --> 00:23:17.110
They've been around, in
the case of those three,

00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:18.840
for at least 50 years.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:24.860
And their aspirational
character was developed

00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:27.740
over that period of time.

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:32.300
And that aspirational
character gives pricing power.

00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:36.597
And that pricing power
allows for reinvestment.

00:23:36.597 --> 00:23:38.055
So we're looking
for global brands.

00:23:38.055 --> 00:23:40.660
We like the developing
emerging markets,

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.610
because that's where the newly
formed demand is arising.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.440
That's where the markets
are un-invested in.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.910
And that's where
GDPs are rising.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.780
Everything I'm
telling you, actually,

00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:57.730
was more true as a context
two years ago than today.

00:23:57.730 --> 00:24:03.850
If you think about the stories
of the current world, collapse

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:07.050
of commodity prices, pulling
back of manufacturing,

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.280
China coming back.

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:13.290
So lots of what I've built
into my investment thesis

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.810
is sort of in flux.

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:19.690
And it's an interesting time.

00:24:19.690 --> 00:24:21.930
But it certainly has
been, for the past 25

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.530
years of the course
of my investment

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:27.300
creator, a one-way tailwind,
the opening up of markets

00:24:27.300 --> 00:24:30.450
leading to the transparency and
liberalization of societies,

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:33.280
leaving people free to buy
things that they'd long aspired

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.090
to, leading our
companies to have a place

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:38.990
to pour back their free
cash flow into meeting

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:42.340
that consumer need as a group.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.350
What else do you need?

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:47.330
And this also favors
international community.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.529
One thing you need to
expand internationally--

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:51.820
if that's where your growth
is going to come from-- you

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:57.070
better have multilingual
and multicultural managers.

00:24:57.070 --> 00:24:58.990
Multilingual surfaces
quite quickly.

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:00.450
In this audience,
how many people

00:25:00.450 --> 00:25:01.991
here speak more than
three languages?

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.580
Good It's rare.

00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.470
It's really rare
in North America.

00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:13.640
It's not at all rare in Europe.

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.450
So at Nestle, I think the top
100 people in the management

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.300
team speak four languages.

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.190
And at Kraft Foods in
Illinois they speak 0.9.

00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:26.170
Multicultural.

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:27.920
That's important.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.580
Let me ask somebody
a question here.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.560
How many people-- just
by raising your hand--

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:34.860
how many people have a
favorite cricket player?

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.480
See, you're a very
unusual company.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.390
That's what makes Google great.

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:44.430
Nowhere else, if I
ask that question,

00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:47.400
will a single hand go up.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.750
1.7 billion people go
to sleep each night

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.059
thinking about their
favorite cricket player.

00:25:53.059 --> 00:25:55.225
And if you're going to be
effective internationally,

00:25:55.225 --> 00:25:56.808
you probably want
to have somebody who

00:25:56.808 --> 00:25:59.840
understands that story line.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.430
So the capacity to reinvest
is not democratically shared.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:06.280
I made light of Kraft.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.600
Indeed, we had and
sold all of our stake

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.060
in Kraft because of their
provincial portfolio

00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:13.780
and their lack of
natural reinvestment.

00:26:13.780 --> 00:26:16.740
They tried to go into China,
they failed, they came out.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.650
They had no people to
develop the market.

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.560
They didn't understand it.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.110
And it's a domestic
company, and it's

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.350
a company that's made lots
of money selling cheese

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.030
and cookies and
meat to Americans.

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:31.490
And America was a
big enough market

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.410
that it kept their
ambitions fully staffed.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:37.870
But they had no capacity
to go internationally.

00:26:37.870 --> 00:26:40.920
We want businesses that can.

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.090
Nestle, Unilever.

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:44.564
They have the bench strength,
they have the brands,

00:26:44.564 --> 00:26:46.730
they have the cash flow,
they have the understanding

00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.360
of where the puck's going.

00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.000
Now in order to do
it the right way,

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.560
you have to have the
capacity to suffer.

00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:55.750
That means that when you
open up a new market,

00:26:55.750 --> 00:27:00.010
you're going to have unabsorbed
fixed costs in spades,

00:27:00.010 --> 00:27:02.760
and that will burden
current income.

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:07.070
If you're not protected
through major shareholders who

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.290
support that long-term vision,
I can assure you-- today

00:27:10.290 --> 00:27:13.280
especially so-- you
will have any number

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:17.460
of a dozen different
activists come in by 1% or 2%

00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:19.770
of your company
and demand better.

00:27:19.770 --> 00:27:20.640
You can do better.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.820
If not, we'll kick you out.

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.410
And no management team wants
to do that, especially midway

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.870
through an investment cycle.

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:29.640
I'll give you a quick example.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.470
We own shares of
Cadbury Schweppes.

00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:32.940
It's a terrific business.

00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.150
They had three pillars.

00:27:34.150 --> 00:27:37.026
They had gum, chocolate,
and hard candy.

00:27:37.026 --> 00:27:39.150
Each one of those came from
a different background.

00:27:39.150 --> 00:27:42.090
in Each one was dominant
different parts of the world.

00:27:42.090 --> 00:27:43.580
Put it all together.

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:47.605
They had great market presence
in parts of the world that

00:27:47.605 --> 00:27:49.770
had been massively underserved.

00:27:49.770 --> 00:27:53.110
The joy of eating sweet things.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.130
So what do they do?

00:27:54.130 --> 00:27:57.140
They decide that they try to
launch the business in China.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.860
And they start out in Hong
Kong, Beijing, and Shanghai.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.310
And they knock the ball
out of the court, everyone

00:28:03.310 --> 00:28:04.560
believes it's a good business.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:05.680
The Chinese line up.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.080
They like it.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:11.460
They go to 200 of the
next cities in line.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.990
So that takes you down to
cities of a million or more,

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:15.710
but there are 200 of them.

00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.600
Now the suffering really starts.

00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.610
Now they're spending
a lot of money.

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.040
They have to
introduce the brand,

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:22.956
they have to build
awareness and all the rest.

00:28:22.956 --> 00:28:24.890
And they do it
across 200 cities.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.580
Now I heard from the CEO of
the company sort of midstream

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.540
through this.

00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.000
He understood that the
investment spending

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.480
was going to just overwhelm the
reported profits out of Hong

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.450
Kong, Shanghai, and Beijing.

00:28:38.450 --> 00:28:41.510
In fact, they'd show losses
for as long as they could see.

00:28:41.510 --> 00:28:45.230
And every year that went by
and they invested like this,

00:28:45.230 --> 00:28:50.240
they built net worth because
they converted consumers

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:53.280
who became loyalists and who
had lifetime consumer patterns.

00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:57.360
And you can know the upfront
value of a converted customer

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.260
addicted to sweet things.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.550
They were midway through the
process, losing a lot of money.

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:06.310
Along comes Nelson Peltz,
knocks on the door and says,

00:29:06.310 --> 00:29:07.930
you gotta do better.

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:10.250
The numbers just
aren't advancing.

00:29:10.250 --> 00:29:11.570
You have to do something.

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:12.970
Give us some earnings.

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:16.080
So the board and the CEO
went home over the weekend,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.940
came back and said, right.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.180
We think we have China wrong.

00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.702
That investment work we're
doing in those 200 cities.

00:29:22.702 --> 00:29:24.160
We're way out in
front of our skis.

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.500
It's just not working.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.600
Let's close it.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:29.180
Now with that, they
manufactured income

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.800
because they stopped
bearing the costs

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:33.380
of investing for the future.

00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:36.070
They destroyed wealth,
because all the people

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.660
who had bought on board the
brands now no longer could

00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:40.710
source them.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.040
And away went the
equity, the goodwill

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.720
that they had created through
that investment spending

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.010
midstream.

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:49.110
And they lacked the
capacity to suffer,

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.310
because when a raider came
and rattled their cage,

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.550
they said fine.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:55.580
We'll do just what you need.

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:57.540
We have a handful
of examples here,

00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.510
which I'll go through
quite quickly.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.090
I'd say the best
example of a company,

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.530
too, that had the
capacity to suffer.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.067
One is inside this room.

00:30:07.067 --> 00:30:09.150
You know, you think about
all the kind of projects

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:14.770
that Google incubates,
burdening profit

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:18.170
with an idea, maybe, of where
it'll end up, but in some cases

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:19.600
not even.

00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.710
That's extraordinarily powerful.

00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:26.212
And you have lots to
show as a result of that.

00:30:26.212 --> 00:30:28.409
That scale would be a
very interesting one,

00:30:28.409 --> 00:30:29.950
because I think you
have an awful lot

00:30:29.950 --> 00:30:32.700
to show for the
willingness to suffer.

00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.650
And Amazon.

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:36.570
Amazon's way out,
even beyond you guys.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.620
I'm not sure that they'll
ever report a profit.

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:42.279
But they certainly have
the capacity to suffer.

00:30:42.279 --> 00:30:43.320
So do their shareholders.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.150
Well, of course they
get rewarded for it.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.490
The price has gone up so much.

00:30:50.050 --> 00:30:55.780
So the businesses that we'll
look at are more traditional.

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:57.304
Berkshire is the best one.

00:30:57.304 --> 00:30:58.720
That's why I learned
this subject.

00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.520
Warren talks about
it all the time.

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.470
But Geico's a great example.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:04.820
Much like
confectionery in China,

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:10.930
it's expensive, it turns out,
to bring on an auto insured.

00:31:10.930 --> 00:31:15.360
And so when Warren
bought controlled Geico,

00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:19.470
he asked the CEO why they only
had two million policyholders,

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:22.630
and the CEO said, because
it's too expensive to grow.

00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:24.840
Every new policy
we put on the book

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.890
loses $250 in the first year.

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:36.410
And ongoing insured make $150
per year of operating profit

00:31:36.410 --> 00:31:37.490
for the company.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:42.160
So you have two million
policyholders making $150 year,

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.070
so they were reporting
$300 million of profits.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:51.110
And if they wanted to grow
a million new policies

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:53.980
the next year--
because as Warren said,

00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:56.350
they had the best
business, under-penetrated,

00:31:56.350 --> 00:31:58.970
the market should
have more of them.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.160
So why not grow it by a
million policyholders?

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.520
What would happen to the
operating income that year?

00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:07.700
It would go from
300 to 50 assuming

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.720
that the other business
didn't grow at all.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.370
Now no public company can
endure that kind of volatility.

00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.480
The activists would be
on that thing so quickly.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:21.190
Inside Berkshire,
it didn't matter.

00:32:21.190 --> 00:32:24.030
Warren controls
40%+ of the stock.

00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:25.760
He's never told
investors that he's

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.260
in the business of
manufacturing reported earnings.

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:29.650
No one get stock options.

00:32:29.650 --> 00:32:32.050
He gets paid $100,000 a year.

00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:36.040
It's all about owner's
equity, intrinsic value,

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.400
and how do you grow that with
certainty as best you can?

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:45.180
Well, no better reinvestment
than to take that $2 million

00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:52.210
insured base up because of its
persistency and its low claims,

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:55.250
lack of adverse
selection as they grew.

00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:58.280
They had a lot of room.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:02.860
And by the way, even though the
first year cost, reported loss

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.760
of a new insured
was $250 upfront,

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.040
the moment they signed up the
net present value, lifetime

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.630
value of each insured, $2,000.

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:17.950
That's $150 stretched out
forever, brought back.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:23.030
Now, so for the
mere inconvenience

00:33:23.030 --> 00:33:25.710
of reporting a
$250 loss upfront,

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.550
they put on $2,000 of value.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.870
Warren got it.

00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:33.950
Today, 14 years later, they
have 11 million policyholders.

00:33:33.950 --> 00:33:36.590
And in the annual report
he said to investors,

00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:39.670
because he's a fair
partner, if you're

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.050
thinking about selling
the business, your shares

00:33:42.050 --> 00:33:45.860
in Berkshire, understand that
book value doesn't capture all

00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:47.950
that we've got that's good.

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:51.750
And he said, for instance, at
Geico we've added $20 billion

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:53.360
of value since we bought it.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.580
Now that's that $20
billion that comes

00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:59.440
from those 9,000 new insured.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:01.050
And the only way
you get there is

00:34:01.050 --> 00:34:04.040
by having the capacity to
let the income statement

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.190
bear the burden.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:08.520
And over that time, they
took their annual ad spending

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.409
from $30 million
up to $1 billion.

00:34:11.409 --> 00:34:14.570
And you'd all know that,
because watching television

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:19.679
is really a series of Geico
advertisements these days.

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:23.320
Another thing that
Berkshire did was,

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.659
the equity index put options.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:28.040
There's a group
that had $37 billion

00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:31.110
worth of equities,
market value equities,

00:34:31.110 --> 00:34:33.350
around the world for
different markets.

00:34:33.350 --> 00:34:36.480
And whatever the
reason, that group

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.440
had to be able to say
to their counterparties

00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:43.550
that that $37 billion
was not at risk.

00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:45.469
They needed for
their collateral,

00:34:45.469 --> 00:34:48.100
whatever the reasons,
to have $37 billion.

00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:51.070
And so Warren was
asked to insure

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:55.070
against the potential for that
portfolio to decline in value.

00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:57.640
He sold them a put option.

00:34:57.640 --> 00:35:02.620
In return, we received
$5.3 billion to invest,

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:05.060
unfettered, for 18 years.

00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.510
It was non-callable and
it had no collateral

00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:11.450
posting requirements, which are
the killers in this business.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:16.990
So why did Warren get
$5 billion to insure

00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:20.830
against the decline of
equities over 18 years

00:35:20.830 --> 00:35:25.670
when, likely, the course of
equity values is up over time?

00:35:25.670 --> 00:35:29.530
It's because the people
who needed that insurance

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:31.950
had nowhere else to go.

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:33.320
First, Warren had the capital.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.890
He had $50 billion of spare
cash which sort of buttressed

00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:39.040
his claims-paying appeal.

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.790
Other people who might
take the $5 billion

00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:43.720
don't have the capital
balance sheet or the culture

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:45.980
to provide for the
ultimate payment

00:35:45.980 --> 00:35:48.980
if the world went to zero
and they owed $37 billion.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.550
Warren has that, and the
culture would honor that.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:54.300
The other thing, the
more important thing,

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.420
was nobody else would
touch this stuff,

00:35:56.420 --> 00:36:01.760
because every quarter there is
a mark to market requirement.

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:05.620
And it absolutely
crushes reported profits.

00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.470
So for example.

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:08.590
After they signed it,
received the $5 billion,

00:36:08.590 --> 00:36:11.150
the equity world
markets collapsed

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:15.520
and they had six quarters
in a row of over $1 billion

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.980
worth of charges to
the income statement,

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.020
some periods as
much as $3 billion,

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:23.412
because global
equities collapsed.

00:36:23.412 --> 00:36:24.870
And every time it
collapsed, they'd

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.370
have to pass through
the reported profits,

00:36:27.370 --> 00:36:28.940
the mark to market.

00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.730
OK.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:31.760
So at the end of the
day he had $13 billion

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:37.540
less in earnings
cumulatively over that time.

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:39.840
But he had $5 billion
which he had put to work.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.660
And that's sort of the
last story about Berkshire.

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.600
Another way in which you could
see his capacity to suffer

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:54.120
added enormous value was that
during the crisis-- well,

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.640
during the period leading up
to the financial crisis of 2007

00:36:57.640 --> 00:36:59.620
and 2008, Warren, at
the annual meetings,

00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:02.500
always lamented the fact that
he had $50 billion cash hanging

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:08.390
around on which he
was only earning .01%.

00:37:10.930 --> 00:37:12.520
And that's the safe return.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:16.000
That's sort of the federal
treasury bills that are secure.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.417
Since he kept it in cash, he
might as well keep it secure.

00:37:18.417 --> 00:37:19.583
But he was only making .01%.

00:37:19.583 --> 00:37:20.150
01%.

00:37:20.150 --> 00:37:24.300
If he had standard
company practices,

00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:26.720
he never would have
kept $50 billion of cash

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:27.560
in overnight money.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:30.110
He would have gone
out three, 10, 14, 40

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:34.360
years on a bond portfolio and
would have had a 4% yield.

00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:37.720
He kept it at .01% because
he didn't trust inflation

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.160
or credits to support
having $50 billion

00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.430
in longer duration investments.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:49.530
The difference between 4%
and 0.1% on $50 billion

00:37:49.530 --> 00:37:52.160
is $2 billion a year.

00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:56.230
That's the amount he
suffered by under reporting,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:38:00.330
because he kept his money
in liquid treasuries.

00:38:00.330 --> 00:38:03.480
That requires a lot of
suffering because $2 billion

00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.210
is a lot of money,
even to Warren.

00:38:06.210 --> 00:38:11.620
Now ironically, to show you
how American companies behave,

00:38:11.620 --> 00:38:15.800
at the same time that Warren was
belly aching about only making

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:23.660
.1%, General Electric had taken
$100 billion of their borrowing

00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:27.530
and brought it into
commercial paper overnight

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:30.780
to capture those same low rates.

00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.620
Now it's a different story
for General Electric, though.

00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:37.200
You have businesses that have
long-term funding requirements

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:42.440
where you can't responsibly
borrow overnight to meet.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:46.350
You can do so if your goal
is to manufacture earnings.

00:38:46.350 --> 00:38:49.400
And off $100 billion in
the overnight market,

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.290
where they might be earning
2%-- they may be paying to 2/10

00:38:53.290 --> 00:38:57.230
of 1%, let's say, maybe even
.03% in the commercial paper

00:38:57.230 --> 00:39:02.540
market-- they should have been
paying 4%, exactly like Warren.

00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:06.200
In their case, they should have
stretched out their liability

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.460
structure.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:10.940
But by taking it all
into commercial paper,

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:14.840
investment bankers assured them
that they could swap them out

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.430
at any minute.

00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:16.610
They could go back long.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:19.170
They could go into yen,
any currency they wanted.

00:39:19.170 --> 00:39:22.360
It was just a number
after all, wasn't it?

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.480
Well, they forgot
one thing, which

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.030
is that overnight
markets can shut down.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:34.190
And when Lehman burst, GE had
$100 billion of overnight money

00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:35.960
that they couldn't roll.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.240
Warren, happily, had
$50 billion which

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.190
he could use to help them out.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:44.380
And he gave them the right
to $12 billion of his money

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:50.830
at 12% with hundreds of millions
of shares of call options.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.440
In case the company
did well, he would

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.530
have the privilege of making
the equity that they recklessly

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.510
threatened by their
non-owner minded ways.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:09.090
Now they were not at
all unusual in this.

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:11.790
This is what public
companies do.

00:40:11.790 --> 00:40:16.720
They bring down the rest of the
cost because it helps flatter.

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.910
In GE's case, that was $4
billion of manufactured income.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:25.610
Now this I would
complain to you about.

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:29.620
However, there's one mega
force on the landscape that's

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.150
done one worse than that,
which is the United States

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.980
government.

00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:40.560
We have taken our borrowing
from $9 trillion to $18 trillion

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.510
through QE, most of which
was not invested but was

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:53.280
transferred, to try to stimulate
some kind of economic growth

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.540
in the absence of a
Congress that doesn't meet.

00:40:58.180 --> 00:41:00.180
And we keep that
money predominantly

00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:02.780
in overnight borrowings.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:04.452
The yield curve
of the US Treasury

00:41:04.452 --> 00:41:10.280
is abysmally short term,
and we are massively

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:14.770
understating, when we look
at our own deficit, what

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:18.950
this country has put itself
into, which is $9 trillion

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:22.990
of additional borrowing coming
through at sort of 1, maybe 1,

00:41:22.990 --> 00:41:24.770
1.5%.

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.880
And the real cost
of that burden will

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.590
be very apparent at some point
when rates go, uncontrollably

00:41:31.590 --> 00:41:35.130
by us, upwards
beyond our control.

00:41:35.130 --> 00:41:37.630
Anyways, I hope
that what, for me,

00:41:37.630 --> 00:41:39.840
has been most
educational from the time

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:43.080
I first heard Warren speak
at Stanford to the present--

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.880
this notion of how the
capacity to reinvest surfaces

00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:49.924
is best illustrated by those
three ideas in Berkshire.

00:41:49.924 --> 00:41:51.840
And there have been a
whole series of business

00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:53.080
that have done it afterwards.

00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:56.310
Nestle is extremely
well-positioned

00:41:56.310 --> 00:41:59.270
in the landscape of
what I look at by virtue

00:41:59.270 --> 00:42:03.580
of having all these
billion-dollar brands widely

00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.700
v distributed throughout
the emerging markets,

00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:12.060
aspirational, and
available, increasingly,

00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:16.280
due to the hard work of
multilingual, multicultural

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:20.030
people delivering
their business.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:23.530
The company does not hurry.

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:26.360
When I first invested in
the business's shares, 1987,

00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.900
the CEO then, because of Wall
Street's miserable reaction

00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:33.530
to their patience,
said, well, what

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.420
is Nestle's planning horizon?

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.910
This is the CEO.

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.770
And he said, without a flinch,
he said, our planning horizon

00:42:39.770 --> 00:42:42.730
is 35 years, but we
tend to break it up

00:42:42.730 --> 00:42:44.370
in five-year increments.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:46.780
Now this is what you
want of a company

00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:48.430
if you're thinking long term.

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:52.030
I think American companies
have a 35-minute, not

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:54.230
year, planning horizon.

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:57.240
This graph, I think,
just demonstrates

00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:59.430
what it is that we're
about, what we're going for,

00:42:59.430 --> 00:43:05.540
which is on the far left, as
you look at low per capita GDP,

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:07.260
and then you move
up to the right,

00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:10.670
you go from subsistence to
buying, to buying better,

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:12.240
to buying luxury.

00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:16.020
And there are two or
three billion people

00:43:16.020 --> 00:43:19.520
in the world sort of at
the far left of 2,700.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.500
I think in China now
today it's 7,000 GDP,

00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.040
but it's bifurcated badly,
probably 500 million

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.600
of less than 1,000.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:30.360
In India there's half a
billion less than 1,000

00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:31.840
in the rural areas.

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:33.760
The country's
probably much higher.

00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:40.480
But it's that migration from
subsistence with no commerce,

00:43:40.480 --> 00:43:43.730
to commerce, into brands
that we're in the midst of.

00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:46.090
And that's what
we invest behind.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:49.690
The company has the
patience on reinvestment.

00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.320
If you look at the very
top of this little chart

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.560
you'll see in Nespresso.

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:55.450
Very, very top.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:58.690
It's a business that they
pioneered about 20 years ago.

00:43:58.690 --> 00:44:01.820
It took them 15 years-- maybe
it was 25 years, I don't know.

00:44:01.820 --> 00:44:04.092
It took them 15 years
before they broke even

00:44:04.092 --> 00:44:04.800
on that business.

00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:08.680
They lost nothing but money
for the development phase.

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:11.070
And they built it right,
and they tested it.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.010
And along the way,
when other competitors

00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:15.224
had wind of what
they were doing,

00:44:15.224 --> 00:44:17.890
they came out with products that
were not nearly so competitive,

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:22.450
like Tassimo by Kraft,
and some others who were

00:44:22.450 --> 00:44:23.970
more interested in short term.

00:44:23.970 --> 00:44:25.650
Nespresso built their
business to last,

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.870
and today they do $5
billion of business.

00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:30.200
Now it's not an
unblemished record,

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:32.250
because Keurig's
a huge business.

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.040
They should have shut them down.

00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:37.994
And Starbucks has grown to be an
enormous presence in the coffee

00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:39.410
business, and they
probably should

00:44:39.410 --> 00:44:41.250
have been more adept at that.

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:44.340
But they still, nonetheless,
had the capacity

00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.900
to deliver a truly great
business in Nespresso, which is

00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:52.340
what these boutiques look like.

00:44:52.340 --> 00:44:53.660
Let's think here.

00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:54.450
We could go on.

00:44:54.450 --> 00:44:56.860
I'll just give you
a quick overview.

00:44:56.860 --> 00:45:00.380
Pernod Ricard, great
portfolio of spirits.

00:45:00.380 --> 00:45:03.867
Two in particular,
Martel and Chivas,

00:45:03.867 --> 00:45:05.200
they acquired through Seagram's.

00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:07.660
When they bought it, it
was in the year 2000.

00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:10.630
China was going
through a downturn.

00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:16.940
There was a company called LVMH
and Diageo, who owned Johnny

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.380
Walker and they own Hennessy.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:23.080
And those were the two largest
brands in China from the west.

00:45:23.080 --> 00:45:25.140
At the time they were
about two million cases.

00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.410
At that time, Diageo said,
OK, China's going into a funk.

00:45:29.410 --> 00:45:33.670
We'll just pull out because
we want to protect our income,

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:34.800
our reported profits.

00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:37.255
Why spend the money now when
the market's turned down?

00:45:37.255 --> 00:45:39.630
We're probably not going to
get a lot of yield from that.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:44.280
Let's take our brands home,
maybe come back later on.

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.250
At that time, Pernod
Ricard had just

00:45:46.250 --> 00:45:50.160
acquired Seagram's, and with
it came Chivas, like Johnny

00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:53.420
Walker, Markel like Hennessy.

00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:55.070
And they said,
well, you know what?

00:45:55.070 --> 00:45:55.770
We're a family.

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:56.972
We own the business.

00:45:56.972 --> 00:45:57.930
No one can take us out.

00:45:57.930 --> 00:45:59.800
We don't have to worry
about reported income.

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.549
Why don't we go in and
see what we can do?

00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:05.130
Now since then, obviously,
China has recovered.

00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:09.890
Chivas and Martel succeed.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:13.540
They're not the largest Western
imported spirits in China.

00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:16.230
Diageo struggles to get
relisted in the country

00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:18.530
that they once
commanded but left.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.160
They left for the
wrong reason, which

00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:25.384
was maintain that earnings
per share, because why not not

00:46:25.384 --> 00:46:26.550
suffer if you don't have to?

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.400
Well, they should have stayed.

00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.810
The long-term prospects
of this business,

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:34.880
however, are not yet scratched.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:39.390
The white space, looking forward
in their portfolio, in China

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:43.440
there are half a billion
cases of baijiu, local spirits

00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:45.130
consumed per year.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:49.480
All of the premium Western
businesses, in total,

00:46:49.480 --> 00:46:51.290
do only four million cases.

00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:58.100
So we've got 549 million
cases that we can go after.

00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:02.940
And an agitant to this
will be the great growth

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.900
in the Chinese tourists.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.260
There'll be over 100 million
tourists this year from China.

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:11.560
As they go to
Europe, they observe.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.490
They're already minded towards
those western trademarks.

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:19.270
And they'll come home
with a couple of bottles

00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:22.522
through duty free and
start to sort of serve

00:47:22.522 --> 00:47:24.620
as local ambassadors
for the brands.

00:47:24.620 --> 00:47:28.610
I think less than 1%
penetration over time

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:30.630
will be a very attractive
platform from which

00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:32.470
we will grow these businesses.

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:35.180
In India, if they
weren't the case

00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.400
that the government has
had such barriers to trade,

00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:41.850
we could see that
business even bigger.

00:47:41.850 --> 00:47:43.850
I would ask the
question of anybody here

00:47:43.850 --> 00:47:46.920
who travels duty free
into or from India,

00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.330
what two bottles of spirits
does every Indian buy

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:54.230
when they return home?

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:55.107
Yes.

00:47:55.107 --> 00:47:55.513
AUDIENCE: I don't
know if it's typical,

00:47:55.513 --> 00:47:56.660
but I buy the Glenlivet.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:58.672
THOMAS RUSSO: Oh,
you're very high end.

00:47:58.672 --> 00:48:00.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:00.780
THOMAS RUSSO: Oh,
you're high end.

00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:02.280
No, it's Johnnie
Walker Black Label.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.230
The numbers, Black
Label's the big one.

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:11.610
But the Indians consume
125 million cases

00:48:11.610 --> 00:48:15.640
of what looks like
scotch, locally made.

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:17.140
Imports are very thin.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:22.890
And Puerto Rico controls
the market, along with BJ

00:48:22.890 --> 00:48:23.900
[? Maya ?].

00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.640
But when and if--
well, I guess I'd say,

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.510
because of what Modi said
yesterday at the SAP Center--

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.600
when, not if, free
trade descends,

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:41.030
we will sell so much scotch
whisky, authentic whisky,

00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:43.960
into a market that prefers
it over their local brands

00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.480
that the investments in
Diageo and Pernod Ricard

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.550
will just, I think,
be pulled along.

00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.760
In the meantime,
they're suffering.

00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:55.090
They're not
absorbing their costs

00:48:55.090 --> 00:48:58.640
because it's expensive to
maintain market presence

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:01.950
and only sell at the very
highest end because of trade

00:49:01.950 --> 00:49:02.780
barriers.

00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.990
Anyways, Pernod,
I think, it stands

00:49:05.990 --> 00:49:09.650
where it does because
again and again and again,

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:13.190
like in 2000 with
China, the family

00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:16.780
has the ability to out-compete
standard public companies who

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.220
worry about stock options
and quarterly numbers

00:49:19.220 --> 00:49:21.730
because they're free
to think long term.

00:49:21.730 --> 00:49:24.740
And if you sat there and watched
a public company dismember

00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:27.740
their premium status
in China, and you said,

00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:31.970
but for quarterly earnings
they would've stayed,

00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:36.240
and you go in to that void,
it's a terribly attractive

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.020
structural advantage.

00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:41.550
I think we pick up by sticking
with these businesses.

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.310
SABMiller.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:43.680
I like this slide.

00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:46.707
It's now, unfortunately, in
the midst of being taken over,

00:49:46.707 --> 00:49:48.290
which is a disappointment
because they

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:49.660
had the right mindset.

00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:51.990
They were South
African breweries. .

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:53.950
They were a pariah company.

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:55.680
They started with nothing.

00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.570
And today they are the
second largest brewery

00:49:57.570 --> 00:49:59.300
in the world, maybe
the largest because

00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:00.900
of the Chinese operation.

00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:04.410
When they invest to
develop the future,

00:50:04.410 --> 00:50:08.130
however, look what happens
to the EBITDA margin.

00:50:08.130 --> 00:50:10.150
Revenues went up a lot
over this period of time.

00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:11.359
This is some time back now.

00:50:11.359 --> 00:50:13.400
Revenues went up a lot as
they were pouring money

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.230
into developing the markets
throughout Africa that they

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:18.700
had a toehold in, but
recognized at some point

00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:20.210
that they were under investing.

00:50:20.210 --> 00:50:22.650
They stepped up the
investment massively,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:24.910
grew revenue, grew volumes.

00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:27.060
EBITDA margin plunges.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.370
That's good.

00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:31.780
That's the burden
on reported profits

00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:35.640
that came from the upfront
development costs of opening up

00:50:35.640 --> 00:50:36.810
those markets.

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:40.050
They had the ability to absorb
that because of the control

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:42.580
shareholder group.

00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:45.240
And Brown-Forman's the
last one I'll talk about.

00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.690
It's ironic.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:49.590
This is how screwed
up America is.

00:50:49.590 --> 00:50:53.100
In Brown-Forman's case, what
I call the virtue of family

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:56.030
control, which is the
alignment of interest

00:50:56.030 --> 00:50:59.740
for the long term, which means
that they're often treated more

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:01.760
cheaply in the
marketplace because people

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.290
worry about corrupt families.

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:09.260
But the irony is that instead
of celebrating family control,

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.440
in their proxy
statement, they have

00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:15.271
to have a section that
says, "A risk factor is

00:51:15.271 --> 00:51:17.020
a substantial majority
of our voting stock

00:51:17.020 --> 00:51:18.700
is controlled by members
of the Brown family,

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:20.283
and collectively
they have the ability

00:51:20.283 --> 00:51:23.240
to control the outcome of
shareholder votes including

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:23.884
this and that.

00:51:23.884 --> 00:51:25.300
We believe that
having a long-term

00:51:25.300 --> 00:51:27.900
focused commitment and engaged
shareholder base provides us

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.290
the important strategic
advantage, so on and so forth."

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:34.810
However, they flag
it as a risk factor.

00:51:34.810 --> 00:51:37.750
I celebrate it as really
one of the great things.

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:42.280
And I first invested in
their company in 1987.

00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:44.750
They had made a bunch of
investment banking-driven

00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.520
acquisitions, all
of which flopped.

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:50.260
And at that point they committed
as a family to do nothing

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:52.610
but grow Jack internationally.

00:51:52.610 --> 00:51:55.120
Wall Street despised the shares.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.040
They had sharply declined
when I made the investment.

00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.280
The company had committed,
at that point on,

00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:03.950
to take what their
heritage was and invest

00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:07.420
against the future
spending internationally.

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:11.596
At that time-- let
me go-- oh, I'm

00:52:11.596 --> 00:52:17.930
going the wrong way-- at that
time, as this shows here,

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.890
international markets were
only half a million cases.

00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:22.570
This was when I
bought the shares.

00:52:22.570 --> 00:52:24.070
Domestic was 3 and 1/2.

00:52:24.070 --> 00:52:27.220
And they committed to
growing that business abroad.

00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:30.220
Now that meant nothing
but years of burden

00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.710
on the income statement.

00:52:31.710 --> 00:52:32.850
Fast forward to today.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:36.310
They have to almost 10
million cases internationally.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.510
The US business came back
because bourbon, for reasons

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:43.270
nobody knows, became popular.

00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:44.260
So it grew.

00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:46.570
But the international one
is the deliberate result

00:52:46.570 --> 00:52:48.220
of investment spending.

00:52:48.220 --> 00:52:50.220
If you look down
below, in 1987 they

00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:53.340
had five markets that had
over 50,000 cases, four

00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:54.260
with over 100.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:57.330
Today they have 41
markets with over 50.

00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:00.790
The march towards 50
is very unprofitable.

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:03.370
You have all the fixed costs
of a distribution network,

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:05.730
partnering,
advertising, promotion.

00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.300
You're not making
a lot of money.

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.440
Over 50, you start to
make a lot of money.

00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:12.600
I think the next
10 million cases

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.760
will be much easier to get
than the past 10 million cases.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:21.680
During this time-- let me
just take a look back here.

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:23.600
The business that I
first invested in--

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.058
if you look down
this list, it says

00:53:25.058 --> 00:53:27.350
gross profit of $563 million.

00:53:27.350 --> 00:53:29.650
Today they have $2 billion.

00:53:29.650 --> 00:53:32.690
Operating capital 182
[INAUDIBLE] $971 million.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:35.230
They dedicated themselves
to doing nothing but growing

00:53:35.230 --> 00:53:35.850
the business.

00:53:35.850 --> 00:53:38.370
And they have the voting
control of the family

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:41.560
that allow them to
do it unflinchingly.

00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:43.150
When they had left
over cash, they

00:53:43.150 --> 00:53:47.030
took it to buy back their
shares, 360 down to 215.

00:53:47.030 --> 00:53:50.920
And the EBITDA went
from 200 to 1 billion.

00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:55.770
And the share price went from
$3.76 to today, it's $110.

00:53:55.770 --> 00:54:01.170
And it's been about
a 13% compound, which

00:54:01.170 --> 00:54:05.710
is sort of what you can really
aspire to in public equities,

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:08.520
in companies that don't
have the kind of profile

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.500
that Google enjoys.

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.140
But this is a hand
very well-played.

00:54:13.140 --> 00:54:16.760
Family had a business
that had integrity,

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.830
that had a culture
that's extraordinarily

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.210
focused on making sure
that nothing that they do

00:54:21.210 --> 00:54:23.754
dishonors Jack
Daniels, the heritage.

00:54:23.754 --> 00:54:25.670
And they're willing to
tell that story broadly

00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:28.700
at the cost of current
income to deliver

00:54:28.700 --> 00:54:30.690
long-term wealth to the family.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:33.912
And so I show it
because it worked.

00:54:33.912 --> 00:54:35.370
We have plenty that
haven't worked,

00:54:35.370 --> 00:54:38.480
just by the way, where
the spending didn't

00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:40.780
sort of yield results.

00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:43.580
But one of the things
you have to understand

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:46.350
is that I think businesses
have to have that capacity

00:54:46.350 --> 00:54:47.590
to suffer.

00:54:47.590 --> 00:54:50.203
And it's true to say that
investment managers have

00:54:50.203 --> 00:54:52.020
to have the same capacity.

00:54:52.020 --> 00:54:54.680
And so if you look at the
history of my portfolio

00:54:54.680 --> 00:55:00.540
returns, you'll see in
1999 we were down 2%.

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.780
The Dow was up 27,
the S&amp;P was up 21.

00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:06.290
In the following
three months, I think

00:55:06.290 --> 00:55:10.050
that both of those indices
were yet again up higher,

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:13.970
and I think I was 10%
down first half of 2000,

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:17.850
and the NASDAQ was
up another 50%.

00:55:17.850 --> 00:55:22.000
I had to have the
capacity for my investors

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:26.610
to allow me the right to
underperform by 29 percentage

00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:32.220
points if I was going to
deliver the kind of returns

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.690
that we have, long term.

00:55:33.690 --> 00:55:40.030
And if you look, as a result of
being enabled to be out of step

00:55:40.030 --> 00:55:42.890
for that period of
time, we ended up

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.860
adding the most value ever
in the subsequent three years

00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.200
by not having the
same declines that

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:52.230
consumed what looked
like those early Internet

00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:54.670
vapor returns that
influenced the market.

00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:57.740
I need to have the capacity
be totally out of step

00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:01.780
with the market if we're
going to add value long term,

00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:03.800
and that year was
a good example.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:07.040
Now this year I think
I'm down 1% at the top,

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.260
and I think the Dow and
the S&amp;P are both down 8%.

00:56:09.260 --> 00:56:12.580
So the markets have
become quite volatile.

00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:16.465
This is the portfolio.

00:56:16.465 --> 00:56:18.340
The names should be kind
of kind of familiar.

00:56:18.340 --> 00:56:22.240
Berkshire, Nestle, MasterCard--
brilliant company-- Philip

00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.549
Morris.

00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:24.840
Most of them are international.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.173
Most them are family-controlled.

00:56:28.470 --> 00:56:32.842
And I think on that note,
I'll just ask for questions.

00:56:32.842 --> 00:56:34.300
AUDIENCE: I have
several questions.

00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:38.600
Maybe I'll give everyone
a chance and come back.

00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.010
THOMAS RUSSO: Let me take
my tie off and settle in.

00:56:41.010 --> 00:56:41.810
Fire away.

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:43.520
AUDIENCE: Easy questions.

00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:47.160
One thing that stands out in
your portfolio is MasterCard.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.630
It's unlike the other
holdings you have.

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.680
It's a strong
consumer brand, not

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:57.430
a family-controlled
business, very asset light.

00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.400
I think if I look
at the financials,

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.570
most of the cash flow
convert into free cash flow.

00:57:02.570 --> 00:57:07.090
Not that many opportunities to
reinvest, but a long runway.

00:57:07.090 --> 00:57:09.680
So kind of being different
from all the other holdings,

00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.680
would you maybe
share your thoughts

00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.640
on how you think about it, and
the factors like this option

00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:17.880
in the long run and
things like that affect

00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:19.390
MasterCard more
than other things?

00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:20.140
THOMAS RUSSO: Yep.

00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.809
It's a great question.

00:57:21.809 --> 00:57:22.600
It's a big holding.

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.570
It's really aligned to capture
exactly the same forces

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:31.700
that I'm looking at in the
consumer portfolio, which is

00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:35.490
the rise of commerce globally.

00:57:35.490 --> 00:57:37.700
And understand
that, at the moment,

00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:42.650
85% of the global
commerce is still cash.

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:45.240
And MasterCard set
about to convert that.

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:48.590
And they have some
partners in this process,

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:51.432
and they have the capacity
to suffer along the way.

00:57:51.432 --> 00:57:52.890
Not because it's
family-controlled,

00:57:52.890 --> 00:57:55.180
you're right.

00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:58.600
But they somehow have
gathered a group of investors,

00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:03.310
including us, who have been
willing to grant them the right

00:58:03.310 --> 00:58:07.040
not to have operating leverage
flatter their statements.

00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:11.260
What happened is, when we first
invested, the world collapsed,

00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:15.150
the shares plunged in
2010 because of trouble

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:17.930
in domestic debit.

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:20.560
MasterCard's it's all
about global credit.

00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.320
But the domestic debit business
changed after the Durbin Act,

00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:28.370
Dodd-Frank, and the shares
sold down to a modest level.

00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:31.260
I met the management team,
and the business is fine.

00:58:31.260 --> 00:58:35.290
They're highly exposed to
the growing and developing

00:58:35.290 --> 00:58:37.270
markets, which I like.

00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:39.820
It wasn't until Ajay
Banga became CEO

00:58:39.820 --> 00:58:43.660
that I bought my first share,
having known him at Citibank.

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:46.620
He's an illustrious
globalist, and has

00:58:46.620 --> 00:58:48.020
the best Rolodex in the world.

00:58:48.020 --> 00:58:50.510
And since he has to
implement this business

00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:53.540
through other partners,
generally around the world,

00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:55.180
he's a perfect person
for the business.

00:58:55.180 --> 00:59:02.100
He also had a
capacity to understand

00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:05.030
that his job was to deliver
to his successor a much

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:05.880
stronger company.

00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.230
That's his view.

00:59:07.230 --> 00:59:10.450
And so every year since
he's been at the helm,

00:59:10.450 --> 00:59:12.720
the gross dollar
volume of business,

00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:15.920
pass-through of their business,
is growing about 13% a year.

00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.000
It's a very high
fixed-cost business,

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:21.390
so all that advance
suggests a higher margin.

00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:22.800
You don't see it.

00:59:22.800 --> 00:59:25.990
He's taking that incremental
operating income that

00:59:25.990 --> 00:59:29.600
arises from more volume
over a fixed base

00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:32.100
and reinvesting it regularly
back into programs.

00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:36.360
He has 55 projects that he
started since he was there.

00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:40.640
He hires, against your great
demand, PhDs and millennials,

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.230
and he's changed the
orientation of the company.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:47.885
And so they poured back into
the business investments

00:59:47.885 --> 00:59:49.260
against the income
statement that

00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:52.660
keeps the income
statement low, lower

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:57.400
than it would be if they
just let those advances.

00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:02.220
Now, the trick is, they have
partners in this business.

01:00:02.220 --> 01:00:04.510
They have partners in
the form of governments.

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:06.860
And n Africa, for
example, the government

01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.540
wants payment
systems because they

01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:12.810
want to be able to disperse
social benefits to the intended

01:00:12.810 --> 01:00:16.300
beneficiaries without exposing
them to the horrors of check

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.940
cashing locations, which
are surrounded by casinos

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:22.750
and bordellos and people who
are trying to steal their money.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:25.900
Instead, they drop the money
into biometrically activated

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.790
cards or phones as
payment devices.

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:30.170
It's very efficient.

01:00:30.170 --> 01:00:32.342
And it gets rid of
all the frictions, 25%

01:00:32.342 --> 01:00:33.800
to cash a check
and all that stuff.

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.490
It's gone.

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:39.580
Other countries
implement payment systems

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.530
because they want to
enhance tax collection.

01:00:42.530 --> 01:00:45.620
The Koreans understand
that their people will not

01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:50.570
declare taxes honestly, and
so 93% of commerce in Korea,

01:00:50.570 --> 01:00:53.540
by mandate, is being done
through payment systems, not

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:54.500
cash.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.984
They just don't
trust their citizens.

01:00:56.984 --> 01:00:58.400
And the way you
get around that is

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:02.160
to have a taxable audit that's
part of the MasterCard record.

01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.520
And so we have all
sorts of products

01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:08.380
that are high technology
payment systems using all sorts

01:01:08.380 --> 01:01:11.030
of phones and other devices.

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.840
And there's just a
general movement.

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:16.930
And since I'm oriented
with the belief

01:01:16.930 --> 01:01:19.510
that global commerce
will grow, we

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:22.710
have 85% of that that's in
cash we're going to convert,

01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:24.160
a higher base over time.

01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.550
So it's expensive.

01:01:25.550 --> 01:01:31.640
It's gone up from $20 a share to
$90 since I bought it in 2010.

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:34.800
So at $90 it's not as
compellingly undervalued,

01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:37.410
but I still think they have
so much work ahead of them

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.140
that it's a worthy hold.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE], is the
capacity to suffer evident

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.300
in the fact that MasterCard has
significantly lower margins,

01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:49.130
although very nice
margins, than Visa's?

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:51.310
THOMAS RUSSO: But that's because
they're investing so much.

01:01:51.310 --> 01:01:53.120
AUDIENCE: So do you
think that's why Visa--

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:54.494
THOMAS RUSSO:
That's the measure.

01:01:54.494 --> 01:01:58.110
AUDIENCE: So maybe
the indication

01:01:58.110 --> 01:02:00.120
is Visa is not
investing as much?

01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:00.710
OK.

01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:01.660
THOMAS RUSSO: Yeah.

01:02:01.660 --> 01:02:03.510
They have their own problems.

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:06.180
They have to buy Europe.

01:02:06.180 --> 01:02:08.930
They don't even have
the full global map yet.

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:13.290
And so they can't invest with
certainty like MasterCard can,

01:02:13.290 --> 01:02:15.270
because they know that
if MasterCard comes up

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:16.860
with something, they can
go around the globe just

01:02:16.860 --> 01:02:17.600
like that.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.820
They have to stop at the
European gate and say,

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.640
can you do this?

01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.410
They'll say no, yes, maybe.

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:24.290
So it's just not as harmonious.

01:02:24.290 --> 01:02:28.970
And I do think that
MasterCard is way outspending.

01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:32.690
The history, at least
now-- Visa has a new CEO,

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:35.402
and they're probably altogether
much better at their game.

01:02:35.402 --> 01:02:37.610
But that, historically,
could explain the difference.

01:02:37.610 --> 01:02:43.930
And I like that, I think,
competitive position that you

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:46.440
see with that lower margin,
because they're investing more.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:47.090
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:02:47.090 --> 01:02:48.000
Wonderful presentation.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:48.270
THOMAS RUSSO: Thank you.

01:02:48.270 --> 01:02:49.500
AUDIENCE: Thanks a lot.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.800
I had a question about
controlling the companies.

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.820
You said there's a
family controlled factor

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.440
that comes into play, and
that helps in basically

01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.210
investing in the long term.

01:03:03.210 --> 01:03:06.930
Do you feel it's exactly the
same kind of control that comes

01:03:06.930 --> 01:03:13.851
in with a tiered share class,
where there are some classes

01:03:13.851 --> 01:03:15.600
that have a higher
[INAUDIBLE] than some--

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.766
THOMAS RUSSO: It's the same.

01:03:16.766 --> 01:03:17.760
It's blocking.

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:20.200
It's the thing that allows
you to say to someone

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:24.030
who would like to come
along and ask you to change

01:03:24.030 --> 01:03:28.980
your orientation, where the
answer is no, we like it,

01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:33.130
and you can't make us,
however that's sourced.

01:03:33.130 --> 01:03:36.640
Now there's a lot of
hand-wringing over the fact

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:40.940
that super voting shares mean
that you control without having

01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:42.910
the economic interests aligned.

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.360
This is a company that
set itself up that way.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.950
It's a young, new company,
and that was the terms

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:56.070
under which they embarked.

01:03:56.070 --> 01:04:01.910
And I think it's healthy to
have that kind of stability.

01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:02.970
We'll see with time.

01:04:02.970 --> 01:04:06.990
But I think it means that
you guys, you people,

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:09.790
can all do exactly what it
is that most inspires you,

01:04:09.790 --> 01:04:13.710
and do so without regard
to the possible hot breath

01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:19.480
of an activist, because--I mean,
think about how Yahoo is all

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.310
congested by virtue of people
coming in insisting they do

01:04:22.310 --> 01:04:24.110
this and this and that.

01:04:24.110 --> 01:04:27.310
You really can't run a
business in that context.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:30.080
And you have the right
to be free from that.

01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.007
And it should allow you
to surface things more

01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:32.590
competitively.

01:04:32.590 --> 01:04:33.650
Yes.

01:04:33.650 --> 01:04:36.160
AUDIENCE: I was curious to
hear if you think that there's

01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.690
a place for value investing
in technology companies,

01:04:40.690 --> 01:04:46.610
because the nature of the
industry is so dynamic.

01:04:46.610 --> 01:04:49.170
I'm not sure if you're familiar
with Clayton Christensen's

01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:50.850
book, "The Innovator's Dilemma."

01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:55.687
A lot of the-- in the cycle
of maturity of tech companies,

01:04:55.687 --> 01:04:58.020
they get to a point where
they're almost like incumbents

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:01.040
defending market share
and sort of investing

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:04.760
in financially viable
investments, which

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:07.960
I guess, in the technology
industry, sometimes

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.670
are not those which
ultimately capture

01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:12.680
the market in the long run.

01:05:12.680 --> 01:05:16.030
So I know traditionally
value investing

01:05:16.030 --> 01:05:19.720
is reserved for more mature,
predictable, slower moving

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.560
types of industries.

01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.726
So I was just curious to
hear your thoughts on that,

01:05:22.726 --> 01:05:25.670
like whether the strength of
a brands like Google or Uber

01:05:25.670 --> 01:05:30.070
or something like that could
help those companies persist

01:05:30.070 --> 01:05:31.899
in spite of the dynamism.

01:05:31.899 --> 01:05:32.690
THOMAS RUSSO: Yeah.

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:34.680
I think it's a great question.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.440
I remember Clayton
Christensen actually unleashed

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:41.780
the sort of excess of 1999.

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:44.050
Going back to that
time, his book

01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:52.730
was basically a battle
cry for companies

01:05:52.730 --> 01:05:55.660
to be willing to destroy
themselves to succeed.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:56.810
That was the whole idea.

01:05:56.810 --> 01:06:00.490
And the beautiful
image of it was

01:06:00.490 --> 01:06:04.120
that you had CEO-to-CEO
businesses, where

01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.100
the old technology
and everything that

01:06:06.100 --> 01:06:09.310
ran the business made
sense CEO to CEO, and down

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:12.650
to the very bottom
of R and D, both

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:15.390
the customer and the
technology company

01:06:15.390 --> 01:06:17.550
recognized that the
old ways were horrible.

01:06:17.550 --> 01:06:20.670
But they could never get above--
they could ever implement it

01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:22.500
because the top, who
had to approve stuff,

01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.750
was quite comfortable with
the way that things worked.

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.083
And there would be an outside
enterprise that would then

01:06:27.083 --> 01:06:31.410
engage what they already
knew in house, because it

01:06:31.410 --> 01:06:35.280
was impossible to champion
an in-house solution

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:39.760
against the kind of static
top that the disruptions,

01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.260
typically, that
happened elsewhere--

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:46.450
but they didn't have to-- at
research level, even in those

01:06:46.450 --> 01:06:47.670
mature businesses.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:48.670
The awareness was there.

01:06:48.670 --> 01:06:50.920
It just couldn't get
up, and that's culture.

01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:53.200
And so ultimately, you've
got to have a culture that's

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:59.280
willing, as it seems this one
is, to source ideas broadly

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:02.840
and don't do so sort of
command control from the top.

01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:05.230
That at least gives you
a shot, I think, at it,

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:10.230
because otherwise, the
technology's so fast moving,

01:07:10.230 --> 01:07:13.760
you'll quickly obsolete it
unless you've got that culture.

01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:16.290
This place may seem to
have that, in which case

01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:20.730
you've got the willingness to
destroy what you relied upon

01:07:20.730 --> 01:07:22.091
and move into other things.

01:07:22.091 --> 01:07:24.090
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
a lot in your discussion

01:07:24.090 --> 01:07:27.850
about investing in companies
that have demonstrated

01:07:27.850 --> 01:07:30.710
the capacity to invest
for the long haul,

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:35.100
and to suffer, and to really,
like, make investments

01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.560
where it hurts.

01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.360
But the question that I come
up with, especially regarding,

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:42.090
say, your Geico
example, is how do you

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:44.960
distinguish companies
that are actually

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:47.480
willing to make hard investments
that are going to pay off

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.270
versus ones that are just
chasing after things that

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:51.520
are actually to short-termism?

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:53.811
THOMAS RUSSO: You know, it's
so interesting a question.

01:07:53.811 --> 01:07:56.900
In fact, I have a
slide that I rushed by,

01:07:56.900 --> 01:08:01.770
and it says, you know, capacity
to suffer is not enough.

01:08:01.770 --> 01:08:08.160
And I had Barnes and
Noble, and I had the Nook.

01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:09.480
And you think, what?

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:12.070
Now Barnes and Noble's
controlled by Riggio.

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:13.120
So he had control.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.060
So he could do it.

01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:21.505
But why would you ever want
to go after you and Apple

01:08:21.505 --> 01:08:25.500
on a laptop or a tablet
or a book reader?

01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.430
What possible
stupidity was that?

01:08:28.430 --> 01:08:31.080
Now mind you, along the way they
had a $1 billion for Microsoft

01:08:31.080 --> 01:08:33.240
and $600 million from Pearson.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.450
So it wasn't their money.

01:08:36.450 --> 01:08:37.960
But wow.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:40.060
So it's got to be right.

01:08:42.609 --> 01:08:44.800
And that's the trick.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.140
That's the only
thing that determines

01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:50.710
our returns over time
is-- for instance,

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:57.890
I had a huge position in
newspapers going into 2000,

01:08:57.890 --> 01:09:01.069
because I often think about
a measure of whether I want

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:05.010
to invest in business is, how
many dynastic fortunes do you

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:06.859
realize have been made
from this business?

01:09:06.859 --> 01:09:09.510
Well, there was no
more dynastic source

01:09:09.510 --> 01:09:12.000
of fortune than the newspaper
business, historically.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:15.276
Every city, the most
prominent people in the city

01:09:15.276 --> 01:09:16.109
owned the newspaper.

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.866
They controlled politics,
money, and everything else.

01:09:18.866 --> 01:09:20.240
And they had been
able to survive

01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.819
each generation of
technology by incorporating

01:09:23.819 --> 01:09:27.210
from print to radio,
radio to TV, TV

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.464
to cable, cable
to something else.

01:09:29.464 --> 01:09:30.880
And then along
comes the Internet,

01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:33.149
and they say no, we
don't want to share

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:34.899
our playground with you.

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:38.390
And it was the most
unbelievable stupid moment

01:09:38.390 --> 01:09:41.380
in the history of
capitalism, because they

01:09:41.380 --> 01:09:44.460
had learned over the years that
to survive, they had to change.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:47.080
They had to do exactly what
Clayton Christensen said.

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:49.340
They had to be
willing to kind of go

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.149
into these new technologies
that threatened

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:54.290
through exclusive
print revenue stream

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.080
for radio, and then for TV.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.710
That was very Christensen-like.

01:09:59.710 --> 01:10:03.830
And along comes eBay
and Amazon, and they

01:10:03.830 --> 01:10:06.305
say no, because they were
both designed originally

01:10:06.305 --> 01:10:08.850
to incorporate a
newspaper platform.

01:10:08.850 --> 01:10:09.700
No.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.870
And that cost them dearly,
because the air went out

01:10:12.870 --> 01:10:15.590
of that balloon real fast.

01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:18.620
And so it's not enough.

01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:21.930
And it's not even necessary.

01:10:21.930 --> 01:10:23.760
I just find it to
be a place where

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:28.510
we have had some success,
sort of thinking through what

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:30.170
it is that we want.

01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:32.420
When we embark upon investing
in businesses that we're

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:35.070
supposed to hold for
a really long time,

01:10:35.070 --> 01:10:36.550
I think these
ingredients help keep

01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:42.340
me focus on important
and knowable factors.

01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.930
MALE SPEAKER: With
that, thank you

01:10:43.930 --> 01:10:47.530
so much for a great presentation
and wonderful conversations

01:10:47.530 --> 01:10:48.090
with us.

01:10:48.090 --> 01:10:48.790
Thank you.

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:50.340
THOMAS RUSSO: Pleasure.
