00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:01.060
All right.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.770
Where we left off we really
were in the home stretch.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:05.840
And now we just have
this messy arithmetic

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.350
that we have to solve to
essentially find our slope.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.780
And then we'll be able to
figure out the y-intercept.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.130
And since we're actually going
to take the square root of this

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.171
eventually, let's just
factor each of these terms

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.070
and see if this
hopefully will simplify

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.670
into something reasonable.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:23.915
So let's just factor 104.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.290
I think it'll be
useful just have

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:26.510
each of these guys factored.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:35.550
So 104 is the same thing as
4 times 4 times 26, right?

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.040
4 times 25 is 100.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.970
4 times 26, which is the same
thing as 2 times 2 times 13.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.650
So that's 104.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.296
So 104 squared.

00:00:48.296 --> 00:00:50.170
Let's just worry about
the radical right now.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.669
So this is going
to be this squared.

00:00:51.669 --> 00:00:58.080
So it's going to be 4 times 4
times 2 times 2 times 13 times

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.670
13.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.140
That's this right over here.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.340
I squared it, so I put
each of its factors twice.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.590
And then you're
going to have plus 4

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.432
times-- let's factor 495.

00:01:09.432 --> 00:01:12.880
495 is divisible by 5.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.386
Let's see.

00:01:15.386 --> 00:01:17.950
5 goes into 500 100 times.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.380
This is five less than that,
so it's going to be 99.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.150
99 is 9 times 11.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.340
So the 495 can be factored
as 5 times 9 times 11.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.592
And then 400.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:36.800
400's pretty straightforward.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.920
400 is going to be times
4 times 10 times 10.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.200
And so we can factor out--
so this expression right here

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.610
under the radical sign, there
is a common factor of 4 times

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.750
4 here.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.510
We have a 4 times
4, and there doesn't

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.457
look to be any
other common factor.

00:02:01.457 --> 00:02:03.040
So this is going to
be the square root

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.865
of 16 times the
square root of-- it

00:02:09.865 --> 00:02:11.490
looks like we're
actually going to have

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.370
to do some serious
multiplication here.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.240
The square root of 4 times 169.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.196
So let's just multiply that out.

00:02:21.196 --> 00:02:22.570
This is really a
painful problem.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.680
Let's see.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.720
13 times 13 is 169.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:38.320
We're going to have 169,
that's the 13 times 13 times 4.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.410
So 4 times 9 is 36.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.830
6 times 4 is 24, plus 3 is 27.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.190
1 times 4 is 4, plus 2 is 6.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:57.140
So all of this right over
here is going to be 676.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.210
And then we're going
to have, let's see,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:04.080
5 times not-- well we know
what this is right over here.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.090
This number right over
here is going to be 495.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:14.730
And we're going to
multiply that times 100.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.390
So this is going to be plus
495 and just add two 0's. ,

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.040
One two.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.660
So it becomes 49,500.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.290
So this is going to become--
the square root of 16

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.149
is 4, times the square root--
this will be interesting.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:34.440
We're going to have to do
some serious factoring here--

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:49.900
of 49,500 plus 676 is
going to be 50,176.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.070
If this was just a 500 here,
then we would get to 50,000,

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.020
and we have another 176.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.460
So times the square root
of this crazy thing.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.130
And so let's see if
we can factor this.

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.660
This is really, really
a nasty problem.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:11.149
So 50,000 looks like
it's divisible by 4.

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.690
So let's see.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.316
4 goes into 50,176.

00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:17.649
We're getting some good
practice here on our arithmetic.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:19.440
4 goes into 50-- maybe
there's a faster way

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.310
to do this-- 12 times.

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.510
12 times 4 is 48.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.170
Subtract, you get 21.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.640
4 goes into 21 five times.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.400
You get a 20.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.130
Subtract, you get a 17.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.260
4 goes into 17 four times.

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.080
4 times 4 is 16.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.290
Subtract, bring down,
then you get a 16.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:44.860
So it goes 12,544 times.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.330
And once again this looks
like it's divisible by 4.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.130
It definitely is divisible by 4.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:52.600
And let's see.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.590
This is going to
be-- I don't want

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.640
to make any careless mistakes,
so let me just divide it again.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.390
I'm tempted to do some
of this in my head,

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.440
but we've gotten so far I
don't want to make mistakes.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.430
So 4 goes into 12 three times.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:05.960
3 times 4 is 12.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.080
4 goes into 5 one time.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.370
1 times 4 is 4.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.430
You have 14.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.220
4 goes into 14 three times.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.140
3 times 4 is 12.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.180
You get a 2, 24.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.480
So 3136.

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.540
Once again, this looks like
it's divisible by 4 again.

00:05:25.484 --> 00:05:27.900
I should have just guessed
that this whole thing was going

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.070
to be divisible by
16 or something.

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.370
So 4 goes into-- don't want to
make a careless mistake-- 3136.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:37.780
4 goes into 31 seven times.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.360
You get a 28.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.752
Subtract, you get a 3.

00:05:40.752 --> 00:05:42.440
33 goes into it eight times.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.450
You get a 32.

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:45.560
Subtract, you get a 16.

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.010
You go exactly four
times, no remainder.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.390
So 784.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.194
Once again, this looks
like it is divisible by 4.

00:05:54.194 --> 00:05:55.610
It's getting at
least simpler now.

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.230
4 goes into 784.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.280
4 goes into 7 one time.

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.460
4.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.910
You get a 38.

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.270
It goes here nine times.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:04.830
9 times 4 is 36.

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.850
You subtract, you get a 24.

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:11.026
196 times.

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:12.900
And really, if you are
going to take the JEE,

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.540
I do recommend being able to
do this mental arithmetic much

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.250
faster because I'm clearly
not capable of doing it

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.240
fast enough.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.920
So you have 196.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.671
And 196, this is divisible
by 16, I believe.

00:06:26.671 --> 00:06:27.170
Let me see.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.030
16 goes into 196.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.490
It goes into it--
actually no it's not.

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.670
So let's just do it by 4.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.740
This is 17, I believe.

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.500
Let me look.

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.440
My brain is fried.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.030
196 four times.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.970
16, 36.

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.910
4 goes into 36 nine times,
so this is 4 times 49.

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:49.940
All right.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:54.270
So if we're taking the square
root of the square root of all

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.860
of this business, this
is 4 times 49 over here.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.575
So this is the square root
of 4 to the fifth power.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.200
So let's just do it this way.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.430
We could just take the square
root of each of these factors.

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:11.790
So this in blue
is going to become

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.730
4 times the square root of this.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:17.160
We could just take the square
root of each of its factors.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.200
So it's going to be
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 2's.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.510
So times 2 to the fifth,
which is 32, times the square

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.370
root of 49, which is 7.

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:29.560
So this term right
over here simplified

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.870
to-- this whole video
has been just arithmetic.

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:37.900
My brain really is
fried-- so 32 times 4.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:38.986
We have an 8.

00:07:38.986 --> 00:07:43.100
4 times 3 is 4 times 3 is 12.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.820
And then we want to
multiply that times 7.

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.100
I think you can see my
handwriting degrade.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:50.795
7 times 8 is 56.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.780
7 times 2 is 14, plus 5 is a 19.

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:00.210
Bring up the one.

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.380
7 times 1 is 7, so it's 896.

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.190
So all that stuff
in blue was 896.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:08.110
So let's see.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:15.970
All of this stuff
over here was 896.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:17.720
Now we have to decide
to do plus or minus.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:19.800
Remember, we want
a positive slope.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.050
So we want to add the 896.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:32.059
So we're getting m squared is
equal to negative 104 plus 896.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:36.409
So if we subtract 104 from
this business over here,

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:47.760
we're going to get 792 over 990.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.100
This is what m
squared is equal to.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.270
These are both
divisible by nine.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:59.170
So let's divide
both of them by 9.

00:08:59.170 --> 00:09:00.910
Let me clear all of
this stuff down here.

00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:03.342
It's Just a big
arithmetic video,

00:09:03.342 --> 00:09:05.050
but hopefully we'll
get the right answer.

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:07.590
It would be painful if I made
a careless mistake earlier on

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.930
and all of this is in vain
and I have to redo the video.

00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:12.480
So let's hope that
isn't the case.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.153
So let's divide
both of these by 9.

00:09:14.153 --> 00:09:17.090
9 goes Into 792.

00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:22.020
It goes int 79 8 times.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.142
8 times 9 is 72.

00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:24.975
And then you get 72.

00:09:24.975 --> 00:09:28.020
So it goes 88 times.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.640
You divide that by 9 you get 88.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:35.350
If you divide this
by 9, you get 110.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:37.890
Now these are both
divisible by 11.

00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:43.520
So if you divide by
11 you get 8 over 10.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.080
8 over 10 is the same
thing as 4 over 5.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:48.950
Unbelievable.

00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:51.240
It all simplified down to 4/5.

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.410
So the slope of our line
m squared is equal to 4/5.

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.790
Or taking the square
root of both sides,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:03.510
m is equal to 2 over
the square root of 5.

00:10:03.510 --> 00:10:05.387
So that's the slope of our line.

00:10:05.387 --> 00:10:06.970
And now we just have
to go back to one

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:09.790
of these equations, whichever
one we think is simpler,

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.220
and find the y-intercept.

00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:12.490
This is the simpler one.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.030
So m is equal to 2 over
the square root of 5.

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.860
b is going to be equal
to the square root

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.960
of 9 times m squared.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.700
Remember m squared is 4/5.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.570
4/5 minus 4.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.930
So what is this
going to be equal to?

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:33.010
Now let me just clear all of
this business out here since we

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.476
don't-- well I'll
just leave it there.

00:10:35.476 --> 00:10:36.850
Maybe it'll be
useful in some way

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:38.100
if I made a careless mistake.

00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:39.310
Hopefully I haven't.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.440
So this is going to be
equal to 9 times 4 is 36,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.795
so it's equal to 36
over 5 minus 20 over 5.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.780
So this is equal to the
square root of 16 over 5.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:56.050
I'm running out of space.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.350
So b is equal to--
36 minus 20 is 16.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:01.940
So square root of 16
over square root of 5.

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.950
Or 4 over the square root of 5.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:07.290
And we are done.

00:11:07.290 --> 00:11:11.000
We now know the slope of that
tangent line, the thing that

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.790
had a positive
slope, its equation

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:17.680
is going to be y is equal to
2 over the square root of 5x

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:21.819
plus 4 over the
square root of 5.

00:11:21.819 --> 00:11:24.360
And if we want to simplify it,
because if I remember properly

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.630
that problem didn't
have it in-- they

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.010
put everything on
the right hand side.

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:29.080
Let's multiply everything
times square root of 5.

00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:35.450
So you get square root of
5y is equal to 2x plus 4.

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.770
And then we could subtract
these from both sides

00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:45.340
and we get negative 2x plus
the square root of 5y minus 4

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.500
is equal to zero.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.710
So do they have that
as one of the choices?

00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:53.440
So it looks like
they do if we just

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.180
multiply everything
times negative 1.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.930
If we multiply everything
times negative 1

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:05.170
we get 2x minus the square root
of 5y plus 4 is equal to zero.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:06.200
And we are done.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.180
This was probably the
most painful problem

00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:09.400
I've done in my life.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:13.160
2x minus the square
root of 5y plus 4.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.734
The answer is B.
