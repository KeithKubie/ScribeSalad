00:00:04.972 --> 00:00:08.642
- ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FIRES
IN FORESTS.

00:00:08.675 --> 00:00:09.943
[applause]

00:00:09.977 --> 00:00:11.678
[English accent] IN THE ROYAL
SHAKESPEARE COMPANY,

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:14.281
WE USED TO CALL THAT
A CATCHPHRASE.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.384
- WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE PARK,
MR. FLAMEY.

00:00:17.417 --> 00:00:19.386
- NOTHING HUMBLE ABOUT IT,
OLD BOY.

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.122
THIS IS MOTHER NATURE
IN ALL HER GLORY.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.259
WHY, THERE, THE MAJESTIC TREES,
A SPARROW OVER THERE,

00:00:25.292 --> 00:00:28.529
AND THERE IS A HILLBILLY NUDE
FROM THE WAIST DOWN,

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:32.666
HIGH ON METHAMPHETAMINES,
EATING PAGES FROM THE BIBLE.

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.069
- HEY, FLAMEY, LOVE YOUR WORK!

00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:37.804
- DELIGHTFUL.
- HI!

00:00:37.838 --> 00:00:41.141
MY NAME IS STEVE.
I AM YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:43.076
- FLATTERED, MY GOOD MAN,
FLATTERED.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.679
AND THIS MUST BE
YOUR LOVELY GIRLFRIEND.

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.216
- SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.785
I MEAN, IF I DATED EVERYBODY
I MASTURBATED TO,

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.488
I'D BE DATING YOU, FLAMEY.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:57.157
- I THINK I'M GOING
TO LIKE YOU, STEVEN.

00:00:57.191 --> 00:00:58.725
- REALLY?
I ACTUALLY MET YOU

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:00.761
A LONG TIME AGO, AT THE OPENING
OF A WINN-DIXIE.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.396
- I DON'T RECALL.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.398
- I JUST WANTED YOU
TO SIGN THIS ALBUM.

00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:06.066
IS THERE ANY WAY
YOU COULD DO IT NOW?

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:09.303
- MY APOLOGIES, STEVEN,
BUT MY BUSY SCHEDULE

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.839
ONLY ALLOWS ME
TO SIGN BREASTS.

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:14.174
- WELL, I'VE GOT QUITE
THE PAIR OF--

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:17.845
- WOMEN'S BREASTS.
- ISN'T HE GREAT?

00:01:17.878 --> 00:01:19.546
- JUST DON'T TAKE YOUR EYES
OFF HIM FOR A SECOND!

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.515
IF HE'S NOT AT THAT OPENING,
IT'S YOUR ASS, STEVE!

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.517
AND WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T LET HIM DRINK!

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.585
- WHY NOT?

00:01:24.618 --> 00:01:26.186
- TRUST ME, DON'T!

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.822
- SHOW ME TO YOUR CABIN
AT ONCE, STEVEN.

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.958
IF I DON'T PINCH A LOAF SOON,

00:01:30.991 --> 00:01:33.093
IT'S GOING TO PINCH ME BACK!

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:38.665
A FLAMEY THE BEAR TOILET.
VERY INTERESTING.

00:01:38.699 --> 00:01:41.401
I'VE NEVER SHIT
IN MY OWN MOUTH BEFORE.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:42.569
- THAT'S NOTHING!

00:01:42.603 --> 00:01:44.438
I'VE GOT "TRIVIAL PURSUIT:
FLAMEY EDITION,"

00:01:44.471 --> 00:01:47.374
AND YOUR AUTHORIZED SEX TAPE
WITH LIZA MINNELLI.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:48.675
- OH, LIZA!

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.745
SHE HAD A CROTCH LIKE
A GIANT BOWL OF TARANTULAS.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.113
SPEAKING OF ALCOHOLICS,

00:01:53.146 --> 00:01:55.883
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING HERE
TO DRINK, MY GOOD MAN?

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:58.519
- UM, I'M SO SORRY,
BUT MY BOSS SAID--

00:01:58.552 --> 00:02:00.821
[laughs nervously]
AND THIS IS CRAZY--

00:02:00.854 --> 00:02:03.891
HE SAID I COULDN'T
LET YOU DRINK.

00:02:03.924 --> 00:02:05.192
- THAT'S TOO BAD.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:08.495
I WAS HOPING WE COULD TOAST
TO OUR NEW FRIENDSHIP.

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.499
- FRIENDSHIP? FRIENDS?
YOU AND I ARE FRIENDS?

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.269
- OF COURSE WE ARE, MY BOY.
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:02:15.302 --> 00:02:16.870
IF YOU PROMISE NOT
TO TELL ANYONE,

00:02:16.904 --> 00:02:20.941
I HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING I WAS
SAVING FOR A SPECIAL OCCASION.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.709
- TO OUR FRIENDSHIP!

00:02:22.743 --> 00:02:24.678
- TO OUR FRIENDSHIP!
UNH!
