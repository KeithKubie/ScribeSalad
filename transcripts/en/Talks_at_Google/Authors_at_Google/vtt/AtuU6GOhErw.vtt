[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.808 --> 00:00:08.626
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:10.250
JACK HARTE: Thank
you very much, Katia,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.070
and thank you Natalia for
the invitation to come along

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:20.390
and share some ideas with
you young people of Google.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.880
It's a great
privilege to be here.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.600
I have been around a long time.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.190
I've written a lot of
things as Katia said.

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.630
I actually wrote text books.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.549
I did that for the
money by the way.

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:37.250
But there's another Google
fact that I don't usually

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.230
put on my CV either since that's
I started out writing poetry,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.520
but I gave it up.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.700
And then when people--

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.212
then afterwards-- after
years would ask me

00:00:48.212 --> 00:00:50.420
like I'd love to see some
of your poetry, and I said,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.980
no, you can't see it.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.880
So I've been writing prose--

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:01.040
short stories, novels,
plays, you name it.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.200
And I want-- this
is my latest book,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.940
and a lifetime of
experience has gone into it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.760
even though it didn't take
a lifetime to write it.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.880
But the first story
in it is-- well,

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.460
one of the first
stories I ever wrote--

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.360
and I think it was probably
around '69 when I wrote it.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.540
It was published I think
in '70 or thereabout.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.150
So that's a long time ago.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.500
And who did it and this
is the first story.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.430
The other ones were
written recently

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.120
but the ideas that
are in the book

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.991
have evolved through a lifetime
of thinking, working, et

00:01:39.991 --> 00:01:40.490
cetera.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.860
So I'll give you a
short talk first,

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.810
and then I'll read
one of the stories.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.395
And then if you have
questions on that,

00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:51.180
you can put them to me.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:58.510
So I want to concentrate on
organization and institution

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.420
because these are two ideas
that I've been playing around

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.425
with and trying to
come to terms with them

00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.420
to analyze for a while
now and very much so

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.340
in this particular group.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.790
To me, the most important potent
word in the English language

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.460
is organize.

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.580
Once upon a time,
it was the slogan,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.380
the call to action of
the political left.

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.230
But for political or
social action of any kind,

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.350
it was also the first challenge.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.020
There was little point in
mourning or complaining.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.420
If you wanted to change
the way things worked on,

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.580
you had to organize.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.580
It meant getting together
like-minded people who

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.180
felt strongly about some issue,
strongly enough to dedicate

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.070
time and energy to the cause.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.550
It is self-evident
that this is how

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.290
improvement in the
human condition

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.400
has been affected since humans
began to live in communities.

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.600
Organize, go beyond the
individual, families,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.140
extended families,
tribes, political groups,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.510
religious communities, nations,
states, international bodies.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.630
I've been around a long time
and have done more organizing

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.640
than most.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.130
The world is more organized now
than it has ever been before.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.390
So am I happy?

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.440
Well, no, I'm not happy.

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.503
I am now extremely conscious
of a negative outcome

00:03:20.503 --> 00:03:25.090
of organization, a phenomenon
that I recognize as a hindrance

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.470
to further progress.

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.830
I call this institution.

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.420
The opposition of
organization and institution

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.570
needs to be understood
and addressed.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.640
Let's take it from
first principles.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.050
A group of people come
together to achieve something,

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.970
they recruit supporters, garners
our resources, become powerful.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.300
Say they achieve their
aim and due cause.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.900
So what do they do then?

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.420
Fold their tents and
go home, disband,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.430
dispose of the assets
in an appropriate way?

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.890
Not likely.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.140
Now you have an
organization that

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.410
has power, resources,
and people in charge who

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.529
like being in charge.

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.820
Even though they have achieved
the purpose they set out

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.090
to achieve or have abandoned
it as the case may be,

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
they continue operating,
inventing new purposes

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.450
but with one
overriding purpose--

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.240
self-perpetuation.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:25.830
This transition I define
as going from organization

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.780
to institution.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.910
An institution is
an organization that

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.700
has passed its use by date.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:36.900
Most political parties are
probably good examples of this.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.630
Because the purpose
of the institution

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.430
now is to serve those in charge
rather than the original cause,

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:46.530
it adopts a very
different outlook.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.100
The emphasis is on
unquestioning loyalty

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.340
to the leadership
to the institution.

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.350
Critical thinking
is discouraged.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.510
Dissent is akin to treachery.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.830
So the organization in
becoming an institution

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.960
is an impediment
to progress rather

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.320
than an agent of progress.

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.480
We see today that
the state, which

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.020
should be the absolute
manifestation of democracy,

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.160
has been turned
into an institution.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.400
And within this we see
institutionalized behavior

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.810
everywhere.

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.300
It is particularly
evident in the response

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.900
when citizens are abused,
whether by the civil service,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.900
the police, the health
service, wherever--

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.350
circle the wagons, admit
nothing, don't apologize,

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:35.900
stand by your
colleagues, the state

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.570
is merely a service
provider and the citizen

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.370
merely a client, just a
client, and not a member

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.590
of the community of
which the state is

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.416
the physical manifestation.

00:05:48.416 --> 00:05:51.060
My book, "Rehabilitating
the Serpent,"

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.570
tries to analyze and
understand and come to terms

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.190
with this phenomenon,
the organization becoming

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.410
institutionalized,
becoming a barrier

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.900
to the achievement of the
very goal that inspired

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.750
the original organizers.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.580
I've taken the area of
religion to examine and analyze

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.780
because one would expect that
this would be the last place

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.390
where the institution
would take precedence

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:20.090
over the central
spiritual mission.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.980
But we know from
bitter experience

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:26.620
that the preservation of the
institution, even preservation

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.150
from embarrassment, is
the central concern.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.000
But I want to emphasize
that what I illustrate

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.210
in relation to religion
holds good for all areas

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.830
of human activity.

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.200
I picked religion
because it sets out

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.510
with the loftiest ambitions
and falls to the lowest depths.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.370
You may be wondering
what would he

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.340
know about organizations
and institutions,

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.220
a writer who has probably spent
his life isolated in an attic

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.030
room.

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.570
So I'll tell you a little
bit about my background.

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.640
I was born in a remote
corner of County Sligo, where

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.780
until then life changed
little for generations.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:11.860
My father was a blacksmith
with nine children to support.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.020
When tractors were placed
horses on the farms,

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.550
his trade and skills
became redundant.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.540
And like so many
more, our family

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.940
became economic migrants.

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.790
Similar families went
to England, America,

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.170
or other English-speaking
countries,

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:31.280
but we just traveled to
the Midlands of Ireland,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.350
where Bord na Mona
was developing

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.490
an industry around the
harvesting of peat for fuel.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.110
During the summer, there
was even work for children,

00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:42.410
footing or harvesting turf.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:45.890
And this was where I earned
my first pay packets.

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:47.510
But within a few
years, the company

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.330
had developed machines
to do this job,

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:53.930
and our manual skills
were redundant.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:55.460
I came to Dublin
with a scholarship

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:58.310
to go to university, but
the money was not adequate.

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:01.580
And instead, I worked at
different jobs including

00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.970
time in a laboratory, five
years in the civil service,

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:06.590
et cetera.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:08.570
But I did manage
to pick up a degree

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:11.120
by entering examinations.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.130
Then I went teaching and
ended my employed life

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.000
as a school principal,
so I probably

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.600
have some experience
at organizing.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.290
I was always leftest
by inclination,

00:08:23.290 --> 00:08:24.950
and while I was a
teacher, I was active

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.230
in the Teachers'
Union of Ireland,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:29.030
serving as chairman
of the County Dublin

00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.460
branch for two years.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.880
Alongside all this, of
course, I was writing.

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.000
I published poems when I was
still in secondary school

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.270
then turned to short stories
in later years to novels

00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:42.970
and plays.

00:08:42.970 --> 00:08:46.930
Dublin was renowned as
a literary city always.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.540
So when I arrived
here in the '60s,

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:53.830
I was expecting to find a
vibrant community of writers,

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:56.650
lots of literary events,
and an atmosphere

00:08:56.650 --> 00:09:00.210
nurturing and inspiring
to young writers.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:02.410
Alas, I was disappointed.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.320
The only literary
institutions were

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.080
the so-called literary poems.

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:10.440
And these were people
by small cliques

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.710
that jealously guarded
their membership

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:14.860
and thus field of influence.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.320
There was no welcome for
working-class young men

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.030
or women.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:22.480
I never found any of the cliques
particularly attractive anyway,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.950
so with other similarly-minded
people of my own generation,

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.310
we began to do things
in an alternative way,

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.980
publishing our own
literary magazines,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.500
organizing our own pub readings.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:39.580
One such series of readings
with music ran for a full year

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.780
every night--

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.840
every Tuesday night in 1975.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.110
Then we published
books, mostly poetry.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:50.020
It was difficult, but we
had reasonable success

00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:53.020
and we were making inroads
into the literary scene

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.640
in our own way.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:57.860
The more I got to
know writers, the more

00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:02.990
I realized that each one was
trapped in a personal world

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:05.840
and that they found it
difficult to make common cause

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.570
with others similarly trapped.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:12.200
The very nature of writing tends
to generate this phenomenon.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:15.710
It is largely a solitary
activity, extremely

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.540
personal like giving birth.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.990
And when the work is
delivered, it is like a child

00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:24.110
in which the author has invested
his ambitions and dreams

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:28.970
and personality and which he now
jealously oversees with anxiety

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.330
and with partisan devotion.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:34.850
As a trade unionist, I
could see that writers

00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:39.410
were ideal for exploitation,
divide and rule.

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:41.570
So they were already divided.

00:10:41.570 --> 00:10:43.835
So it was only too
easy to exploit them,

00:10:43.835 --> 00:10:46.160
and exploited they were.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:48.380
Often they were not
paid for their work.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.290
They surrendered
their rights in a loop

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.960
to publishers with little
reward without even

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.310
considering the consequences.

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.820
And the state had no
qualms about marketing

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.180
the country as a
tourist destination

00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:06.090
on the back of all the writers
who brought distinction to it.

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.570
At the same time, the
state expected writers

00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:12.200
to be humbly grateful if they
threw a few crumbs to them

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.760
by way of so-called
funding for the arts.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.670
I could see all of
this and could not

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:24.880
understand how writers had some
of self-respect as a profession

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:26.910
that they let this happen.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.910
There was almost
no infrastructure

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.510
for representing writers or
for addressing their issues

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:33.800
at the time.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.490
Writing was still regarded
as the privileged occupation

00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:39.950
of a privileged few.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:43.490
I remember in the early
80s, Christina Murphy

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.000
ran a groundbreaking series
of educational articles

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.280
in "Irish Times"
advising students

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.620
on their career options.

00:11:51.620 --> 00:11:55.190
While every possible career
was covered and many impossible

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:59.240
ones, writing was not
given so much as a mention

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.040
apart from journalism.

00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:04.410
An activity that generated
countless millions of Euro

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:09.200
for the economy was not
considered a profession.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:12.410
In 1983, I was appointed
to a position as principal

00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:15.860
of a vocational school in
Lucan to become Lucan Community

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:18.000
College four years later.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.680
This opened up some
opportunities for me.

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:25.820
Up until then, there were no
workshops for aspiring writers

00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.590
as we know them now.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:29.850
So on one night a
week in my school,

00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:33.080
I mounted a program
of workshops to cater

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.060
for a whole range of genres--

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:39.770
fiction, poetry, drama--
and in two languages.

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:42.050
I employed established
writers to conduct

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.570
these workshops and so
put money in their pockets

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:46.130
however little.

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:50.180
The 80s where a time
of high unemployment,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.470
immigration, cutbacks,
austerity of every kind.

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:57.860
The government brought in the
first community employment

00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:01.940
scheme in order to take
people off the Live Register.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:04.580
Schools were included among
the bodies who could employ

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:06.800
such people under the scheme.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.320
So I applied to employ personnel
including two writers, one

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.780
to be a writer in
residence in the school,

00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.410
the other to do research for me
on the possibilities of writing

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:20.790
as a feasible profession.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:23.590
It was approved, and for
the first time in Ireland,

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:26.390
we had someone recognized
as being employed

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:28.430
as a professional writer.

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.290
The first writer in
residence was not

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:31.420
in any of the universities.

00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:36.300
It was in Lucan
Vocational School.

00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.640
With the man who was
employed as a secretary,

00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.910
I began to assemble the names
and addresses of as many

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.220
writers as I could identify.

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:47.970
By the summer of 1986,
we had about 100 names

00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:50.190
and addresses of the
most prominent writers

00:13:50.190 --> 00:13:51.760
in the country.

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.680
This was a greater feat and
you people might realize.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.100
It was before personal
computers, before the internet,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.300
before Google.

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.710
What one could do in a few hours
today with access to Google

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.720
took us several months.

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:10.560
Then to contact them, I had to
duplicate a circular explaining

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.750
what I was aiming
to do and inviting

00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:16.770
them to join the trade union,
the Irish Writers' Union.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.620
We sent out the circulars
in a single crunch

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:22.510
because I was afraid that
if I did it piecemeal,

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:26.040
one clique might associate
the union with another clique,

00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:28.860
decide that they would
never join an organization

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:30.810
that the others were in.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:36.270
So I was absolutely relieved and
delighted when almost everyone

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:38.790
immediately joined up.

00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:44.160
The organization was clearly
something whose time had come.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.110
Over the autumn of 1986,
I had a series of meetings

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:50.550
so that we had a fully
established trade union

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:53.610
by the 1st of January 1987.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:55.830
We immediately began to
work on the issues that

00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.130
had been festering for
generations like writers'

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.680
contract, payments for
appearances at festivals,

00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.110
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:07.970
Even censorship raised
its head that year,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:11.420
and we had to deliver
our coup de gras.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.730
During that year, 1987,
the general election

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.230
put Fianna Fail into office with
Charles Haughey as Taoiseach.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.530
Haughey had a genuine
interest in the arts

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.770
and kept the arts portfolio
in his own department,

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:28.880
appointing the writer Anthony
Cronin as his advisor.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.210
As it happened, Anthony
Cronin had joined

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:34.495
the Irish Writers' Union.

00:15:34.495 --> 00:15:35.870
After a couple of
weeks when they

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:37.953
had judged that they had
settled into their seats,

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:40.280
I phoned Anthony Cronin.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:42.740
His immediate
response was, Jack,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.180
I know what you're looking for--

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:45.210
money.

00:15:45.210 --> 00:15:46.820
But the word is
here that there is

00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.100
money for absolutely nothing.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:51.325
I replied, no, Tony.

00:15:51.325 --> 00:15:53.600
I'm not looking
for money, but I've

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.430
no idea I want to run past you.

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:58.720
You're sure you won't
be looking for money?

00:15:58.720 --> 00:15:59.860
I won't.

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.270
So he met me, and I
explained in earlier times,

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.480
the government had bought
up many old Georgian houses

00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:12.040
in the central Dublin as offices
for an expanding civil service.

00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.400
Now during the 80s
recession, the civil service

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:16.990
was shrinking again.

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.420
Many of the buildings
have been vacated,

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.990
and the state could not afford
even the cost of their upkeep.

00:16:22.990 --> 00:16:26.680
Neither could they sell them
because no one wanted to buy.

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.790
I want one of those buildings
for a writer center.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:33.250
I gave them an outline of
how such a center could

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:35.800
be what a good facility is--

00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.640
a base for organizations,
a venue for events,

00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.230
a drop in center for
writers, an information hub,

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:47.050
a facility for workshops and
professional development.

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:51.080
It took five maybe 10 minutes,
and then he turned to me.

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.022
He said, you know,
that's a great idea.

00:16:54.022 --> 00:16:54.730
Leave it with me.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.680
I'll see what I can do.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.310
Within two weeks,
he phoned me back.

00:16:59.310 --> 00:17:00.730
You're on, he said.

00:17:00.730 --> 00:17:03.640
I got approval for that idea.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:05.859
Later that same
year, the government

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.839
launched the national lottery.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.589
I submitted a case for funding
for the Irish Writers Centre

00:17:11.589 --> 00:17:15.829
and received a grant of 100,000
pounds, a building and a grant.

00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:19.099
It was a start.

00:17:19.099 --> 00:17:22.207
Of course, we ended up
in 19 Parnell Square,

00:17:22.207 --> 00:17:24.010
but that's a long story.

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:29.870
We'll be here until tomorrow if
we went through all the twists

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.235
and turns of the story.

00:17:31.235 --> 00:17:34.430
Meanwhile, the work of the
union had to be kept under way.

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.960
Negotiations with other
literary organizations

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.190
led to the playwrights
and translators

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:43.860
participating in the
proposed new writer center.

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.540
Negotiations with publishers--
the publishers organization

00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.620
set in motion a project to
establish a copyright agency.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:56.280
By the time the Writers'
Centre opened in 1991,

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:59.570
we had one of the best organized
literary sectors in Europe,

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.780
having started out four
years earlier with the worst.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:08.590
The key to our success
lay in organization.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:12.420
I've always been conscious of
the way organizations become--

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.040
can become fossilized
and the consequent need

00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.260
for turnover of personnel.

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.730
Originally, I had
hoped to achieve

00:18:19.730 --> 00:18:23.840
all I set out to achieve in
two years and then bow out.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.560
But it took me five years.

00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:28.570
Then I retired
totally from the scene

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.970
and left it to others
to continue the work

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:34.480
and make their own unique
contribution without having me

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.630
looking over their shoulders.

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:41.920
But in 2009, I was thrust
back in the midst of it again.

00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:45.010
The first cutbacks
of the new recession

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.090
hit the arts community
with vicious intent.

00:18:48.090 --> 00:18:52.410
And the grant to the Writers'
Centre was withdrawn entirely.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.420
Up until then, the
Writers' Centre

00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:57.130
had been receiving
a generous grant.

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:59.980
However, it was the
assessment of the Arts Council

00:18:59.980 --> 00:19:02.890
that it was not delivering the
value of our money in terms

00:19:02.890 --> 00:19:05.200
of services to writers.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.020
I think any fair minded
observer at the time

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.970
would not have contested
that assessment.

00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:15.090
Over some years, the center
had become complacent

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.230
and eventually become what
I call an institution.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:22.320
The original drive to
serve the writing community

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.690
had been lost,
and now the center

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:28.100
served nearly the interests
of the people involved.

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.700
But they felt secure.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:33.480
After all, this was the
Irish Writers' Centre,

00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.050
too important to be
dumped, but dumped it was.

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.270
The staff were made redundant.

00:19:39.270 --> 00:19:42.990
Most of the board fled less they
be contaminated by association

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.640
with this failed entity.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.620
Only the binding remained and
three brave board members.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.800
It was clear that the Arts
Council had ruthlessly decided

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:56.670
that the center would close.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.550
The stalwart three
invited me to re-join,

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.940
and four made a quorum
for business purposes.

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:07.170
We stabilized our relations with
the bank and other stakeholders

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:11.850
maintaining confidence that we
could survive despite the odds.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:17.760
Then the debates started as to
how the establishment advisors

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:22.650
who came along claims that we
could survive only if the Arts

00:20:22.650 --> 00:20:25.150
Council restored the grant.

00:20:25.150 --> 00:20:27.730
I proposed that we had to
start from the beginning

00:20:27.730 --> 00:20:31.540
again, turn the board into
an executive committee,

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:34.060
and recruit people who
were prepared to contribute

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.770
some time and work.

00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:38.560
We had to organize.

00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.890
This horrified the
establishment advisors

00:20:41.890 --> 00:20:46.030
who clarified that the official
guidelines of the Arts Council

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:48.970
demanded boards to
govern, not to be

00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:51.795
involved in the running
of the body in question.

00:20:51.795 --> 00:20:54.670
But we had nothing to govern.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:57.740
My three colleagues had just
a short tenure on the board,

00:20:57.740 --> 00:21:00.650
so I took over as chairman.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:03.620
There was an atmosphere of
doom in the country that year

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.210
because of the recession.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:07.980
There were no jobs
for the generation

00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.200
of graduates who left college.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.180
I felt that some of
these young people

00:21:12.180 --> 00:21:14.550
would prefer to be working
for nothing than hanging

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:16.170
around Starbucks.

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:19.170
So I recruited a
team of volunteers

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.980
to unpaid but full-time
jobs running the Centre.

00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:27.070
The success of the project
is manifest in the fact

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:29.590
that the Writers'
Centre not only survived

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.720
but has been
thriving ever since,

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.530
embarking on new areas
of activity all the time.

00:21:35.530 --> 00:21:37.120
It is not just a place.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.270
It is a vibrant organization.

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.060
Having served my four years
this time on the board,

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:46.850
I stood back again in 2012.

00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:50.200
As I mentioned, my book
"Rehabilitating the Serpent"

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.980
tackles this phenomenon
of organizations becoming

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.680
institutions often
with values that

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.750
are in direct contravention
of those of the originators.

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:05.020
And it is probably most evident
in the case of religion.

00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.920
All religions begin in
an imaginative effort

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:13.760
to interpret this very
confusing existence of ours

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.324
and to suggest ways in
which life can be improved.

00:22:17.324 --> 00:22:20.790
But as soon as an
idea gains traction--

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.570
[COUGHS]-- sorry.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:27.170
As soon as an idea gains
traction, as soon as

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:30.590
an organization gains
ground, certain people

00:22:30.590 --> 00:22:32.730
take over all of the time.

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.460
They see the
opportunity of gaining

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:38.600
power over other people,
manipulating and exploiting

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.030
them for their own ends.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.190
They take control
of the organization

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:48.000
and turn it into an institution
with a central purpose

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.440
self-perpetuation, self-serving.

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:54.200
It happens in most revolutions.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:59.650
It happened to Marxism as well
as to the major religions.

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:02.020
When I was growing
up, the expectation

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:04.720
was that in the
scientific age, religions

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.120
would become less
influential, would

00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.440
be relegated to private
practice in a secular world.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.100
No one would have anticipated
that the inherent attractions

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:18.130
of religion would still
be used as instruments

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:24.030
of hate and murder by power
mongers in the 21st century.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.780
I am a writer, a storyteller .

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.700
And when I have something
important to say

00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:30.770
or an insight I
want to communicate,

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.160
I must do it through story.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.410
And so I want to read you a
story from "Rehabilitating

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:40.940
the Serpent" in which I oppose
the end point of religion

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.490
with its starting
point in the hope

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:47.120
that people will recognize
that institutional--

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.600
institutionalizing religion
is another travesty

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.800
and destroys the very thing
it is meant to nurture.

00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.800
And it's called
"The Silent One."

00:24:08.231 --> 00:24:09.225
Wrong book.

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:17.910
Important that the
page is marked.

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.370
So this called the silent one.

00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:26.350
"All day they have been
streaming into my wilderness,

00:24:26.350 --> 00:24:30.460
assaulting my peace with their
noise and their questions.

00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.980
I bolted my door
and refused entry

00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.270
to the clamouring hordes
with their waving microphones

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.180
and their sparking cameras.

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.150
When the mayor of my local
town appeared at the window,

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:45.910
I relented and opened
the door momentarily

00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:47.860
to let him slip through.

00:24:47.860 --> 00:24:51.160
I visited the town once a
month or so to barter goods,

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.020
so I was familiar with him.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:55.540
I had always done
my best to sustain

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.600
a non-hostile relationship
with the townspeople.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.000
The mayor was almost breathless.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.410
He explained that The Silent One
had been captured and summarily

00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:08.090
executed.

00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.220
During his brief
interrogation, he

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:14.720
had remained true to his
name and said nothing.

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.910
Then as they raised
their guns, he

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:22.500
said, ask Johnny to tell you
what happened in the camp.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.730
Johnny is not my real name.

00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:27.880
It is a label of convenience
of the global language,

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:33.700
a word that is provided
anonymity but The Silent One--

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.820
let us call him Peter
in the global language--

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:39.500
would have given my name
in our native language.

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.850
Otherwise, they would
never have identified me,

00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.330
or it would have
taken them longer

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.680
than a week to track me down.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.670
Anyway, Peter would
hardly have known

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:53.300
the name I had adopted
in the global language.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:56.480
The Silent One, a name
that has transmitted

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.080
fear across much of the world.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:04.100
In our holy wars, he was
the absolute holy warrior.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.600
He slaughtered and slaughtered
and slaughtered, but never

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.420
once did he proclaim his faith.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.890
Never once did he,
like the others,

00:26:13.890 --> 00:26:16.790
offer up his deeds
to the god he served.

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.450
Hence his name The Silent One.

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:24.050
They did not understand him, so
they feared him all the more.

00:26:24.050 --> 00:26:27.950
No wonder they dispatched
him with such urgency.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:32.000
It might appear like a label
of convenience concocted

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.810
by the media to give immediate
identification and concrete

00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:40.430
form to the shadowy turn
he represented for them

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:43.850
and that they loathed to
embellish for their audience.

00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:47.380
But he had always
been The Silent One.

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.285
The mayor explained that
the media were pouring

00:26:50.285 --> 00:26:53.090
in from all around the world.

00:26:53.090 --> 00:26:57.440
They were prepared to pay any
fees I quoted for my story.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.470
A stage was being assembled
right outside my home,

00:27:01.470 --> 00:27:03.590
especially from my interview.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:05.750
It will be ready per 9:00.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:09.490
That was prime time for
broadcasting a news story.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:11.540
And the sun would be
gone down, so the stage

00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.240
would look splendid
on the lights.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.823
Everything would be crisp and
clear for the watching world.

00:27:17.823 --> 00:27:21.480
And he had assured the media
people of my adequate command

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:24.020
of the global language.

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.000
That was more or
less what he said,

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.980
and I let him slip out again.

00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:29.660
He had to get ready.

00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:32.120
No doubt he would dress
in his finest, hoping

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.040
for an appearance on the
stage at 9, a prelude

00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:40.540
to break through into
major league politics.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.770
All day long, the big
trucks kept arriving,

00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:48.850
their satellite dishes posturing
self-importantly over the cams.

00:27:48.850 --> 00:27:52.830
Other trucks brought tons
of scaffolding and lights

00:27:52.830 --> 00:27:55.120
and electricity generators.

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.240
They were assembling the
stage at an incredible rate,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:02.120
and I had to marvel at their
arrogance, their presumption,

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:04.870
their unquestioning
sense of entitlement.

00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:10.390
What happened in the camp?

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:11.800
How long ago was it?

00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.410
20 years, more?

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:17.260
But it felt like 200 years ago.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.470
It seemed as if it had happened
to others in another world

00:28:20.470 --> 00:28:23.980
or in a particularly
nasty nightmare.

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:27.290
The passage of time had
not dulled the memory

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.680
but had petrified
the experience.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.750
It lodged in the soul
like a granite sculpture,

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.530
precise in every
detail, immutable.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:41.360
Yet I no longer engaged with
it in a condition of trauma.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.390
We were children then,
confined to the camp.

00:28:44.390 --> 00:28:47.510
Our parents were dead or
missing in the latest outbreak

00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.400
of the holy wars.

00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:53.570
Peter was of course referring
to what happened to Lucy.

00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:57.220
Lucy was not her name
in our native language

00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.150
but the name the global language
that best represents her for me

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.990
because her image
always evokes light.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.270
She radiated light,
attracted light.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:11.610
She simply was light.

00:29:11.610 --> 00:29:14.220
She was a little older
than me, not much older,

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:15.950
perhaps a year or two.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.110
Peter was a year or
two younger again.

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:21.190
That is an age gap
among children.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.320
And we looked up to her as
if she were already an adult.

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.570
To me, she was the
most beautiful creature

00:29:26.570 --> 00:29:28.500
in the world.

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:31.140
One day we were gathered
in a corner of the compound

00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:34.360
where the barbed wire fence
segregated our beaten earth

00:29:34.360 --> 00:29:37.410
with a pastured
countryside beyond.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:40.080
We were particularly
downcast in spirit,

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.050
and one little girl
complained how can God

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:45.630
let so many bad things happen.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:47.640
Similar thoughts had
no doubt wondered

00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:49.680
to the mind of the
rest of us, but we

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.230
were wary of articulating them.

00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:54.870
So we deflected the
question towards Lucy,

00:29:54.870 --> 00:29:57.570
who seemed to have read all
the books in the library

00:29:57.570 --> 00:30:00.910
before they burned it down.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:03.690
There was only one
explanation, said Lucy.

00:30:03.690 --> 00:30:04.540
God is dead.

00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:06.960
They've kill God.

00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:09.540
Every one of us was shocked
and even more downcast

00:30:09.540 --> 00:30:10.870
at this news.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:13.110
If God was dead, then
we had every reason

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:17.560
to believe Lucy, who then
would come to rescue us.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.260
She must have seen the
despair in our faces

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.720
because she immediately
lifted her voice.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:27.140
Listen, she said, and our
heads bunched into a huddle

00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:28.720
with hers.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.180
I read that there was
a people somewhere

00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:36.100
who believe that God sang
the word into existence.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:38.230
Isn't it lovely to think that?

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.150
Imagine God waking
up one morning

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.830
in good humor beginning to hum.

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:46.930
As he hums, he creates the air,
and there is a fresh breeze

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:48.560
to cool his face.

00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.490
So he hums louder
and creates the sea.

00:30:51.490 --> 00:30:53.755
The wind and the sea began
to play with one another,

00:30:53.755 --> 00:30:57.490
and God is so happy that he
hums the land into existence

00:30:57.490 --> 00:31:00.190
and gives them the
beach to play on.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:04.060
At this stage, God is excited,
and he breaks into song.

00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.460
He sings the sun and the
moon and the stars into life.

00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:11.050
His song rises, and he
creates the thunder clouds

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.220
and the rain.

00:31:12.220 --> 00:31:14.530
His voice softens,
and he creates

00:31:14.530 --> 00:31:19.150
the flowers and the insects,
the birds and the animals.

00:31:19.150 --> 00:31:21.520
By the time he takes
a rest, we-- he

00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:24.400
finds that he has
created a whole world.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:27.010
Sitting back,
admiring his creation,

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:29.440
he thinks that it would
be good to have creatures

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.840
who would appreciate how
wonderful this world is

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.750
that he had created.

00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:39.590
So one final time, he sang and
wrote human beings into life.

00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:41.930
He showed them his
beautiful creation

00:31:41.930 --> 00:31:47.460
and asked them to mind it for
him to sustain it by singing.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.340
That is a lovely god, said
one of the younger children.

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.900
And now they have killed him.

00:31:52.900 --> 00:31:56.760
Lucy was quick to detect
the new surge despondency.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.480
Yes, they have, she said.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:01.950
But what if we can sing
God back to life the way

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.740
he sang the word into existence?

00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:08.050
What if there is a little
spark of him left somewhere,

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:12.130
and we can fan it to
life with our voices?

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.580
How can we do such a thing.

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.520
We're not very good singer.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.980
We do not have any songs.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.310
We can do our best, said Lucy.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:22.180
And we do have songs.

00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:25.810
She started humming one of our
skipping rhymes then twisted

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:28.960
the words cleverly to mean
that she was bringing God back

00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.860
to life, followed by a litany
of beautiful names for the god

00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:35.780
she was resuscitating.

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:37.700
All of this was in
our native language,

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.560
of course, so there's
no point in my

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.370
trying to recall the words.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.820
But every one knows street
rhymes, even those anemic ones

00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.790
in the global language.

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.400
We all joined in, skipping
to this incantation,

00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.640
and it lifted our spirits.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.480
Then Lucy took another
line used for street game.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.400
Again, it was more
difficult to play

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.190
on the caked earth of
the camp as it involved

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:04.160
hopping on one foot by
kicking a storm to a target

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.140
spot with that standing foot.

00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:09.140
This rhyme she
shaped into a prayer

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:13.220
that the reborn God would come
and rescue us and reunite us

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:15.940
with our families.

00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.930
Every day, Lucy had
adapted another line

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.380
for the purpose of
singing God back to life.

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:25.200
We rapidly learned each
rhyme and chanted it

00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:30.390
with enthusiasm and a growing
confidence in our endeavor.

00:33:30.390 --> 00:33:35.190
Then one day, a man was
passing and paused to listen.

00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:37.110
Peter was the
nearest to him, so he

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:40.920
asked what the curious lines
were that we were chanting.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.580
Peter enthusiastically
replied that God was dead

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.810
but that we were going
to sing him back to life.

00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:50.550
The man inquired
whose idea that was,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:53.330
and Peter proudly
declared that Lucy

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.500
had composed the songs for us.

00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.900
The man, like all
the men in the camp,

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.560
gloried in being a fighter
for the cause of religion.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.680
He was clearly horrified
by what he heard.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:09.580
He grabbed Lucy by her long
hair and dragged her with him,

00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:13.690
cursing her with words
like whore and slut.

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.219
I followed at a distance.

00:34:16.219 --> 00:34:18.860
He dragged her into a
house of one of the elders.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:20.960
Within a short time, I
could see men arriving

00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:26.199
and understood that it was a
hastily assembled tribunal.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:29.710
When they were all inside, I
went to the door and listened.

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:32.170
They were accusing
her of blasphemy,

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:35.110
of being an agent of the
Devil and calling her

00:34:35.110 --> 00:34:37.270
all sorts of nasty names.

00:34:37.270 --> 00:34:39.750
All of them agreed
that this illustrated

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.370
the mistake of
teaching girls to read

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:44.920
and allowing them
access to books.

00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.860
They lorded the wisdom of
burning down the library,

00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:51.670
and they condemned her to be
burned to death in the square

00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.400
the next morning.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.710
I followed wherever
they brought her.

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:58.810
After the sun went
down, they dragged her

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:02.890
to a tent in the quarter where
the fighters were billeted.

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:05.920
Surely they wouldn't do
anything to a child, I thought,

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:07.840
but I feared the worst.

00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.480
Although still a child,
Lucy was on the threshold

00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:11.980
of workwomanhood.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:13.900
And I remember the
way the men glanced

00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.040
at her with a mixture of lust
and lording in their eyes.

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.360
I heard Lucy screaming
and moaning in pain

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.560
and imagined the
unspeakable things

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.630
they were doing to
her in the tent.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:29.950
A queue formed, and the men took
turns going inside as if they

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:32.270
were using the latrine.

00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:36.850
After a while, I heard no more
screams or moans from Lucy.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:39.910
I sat on a low wall
outside the tent.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:41.980
The fighters ordered
me off several times,

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.690
but I didn't budge.

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:45.670
One of them threw a
stone at me, and even

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.940
though it hit me hard on the
shoulder, I didn't wince.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.220
Eventually, they left me alone.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.200
I was determined
to stay as close as

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:58.350
possible to Lucy so that she
might sense my presence however

00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:01.280
unlikely thought might be.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.430
All night, I kept vigil
when that obscene queue

00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:09.510
of holy warriors snaked its
way to the door of the tent.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:11.560
As soon as the first
ray of sunlight

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.530
glinted on the
horizon, they dispersed

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:18.550
as if their deed did not bear
the scrutiny in daylight.

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.510
I continued my vigil
until two fighters

00:36:21.510 --> 00:36:25.940
emerged dragging Lucy's already
half dead body between them

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:28.400
to the central square
where they chained her

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.730
to the granite column.

00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:33.540
I sat on the ground in
front of her so battered,

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:37.610
so mutilated, she
was barely conscious.

00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:40.640
Just then, I was aware of
someone else at my shoulder

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:43.710
and turned to see Peter.

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:46.350
The expression of
absolute despair,

00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:50.850
absolute suffering on his
face was terrible to witness.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:54.120
I put my arm around his shoulder
to assure him that he was not

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.810
responsible for this savagery.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.210
I said something to Lucy
to catch her attention

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.160
to alert her to our presence.

00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:06.990
But she did not reply but
focused her eyes on me.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:08.820
I said something else.

00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.650
She raised her
hand to her mouth,

00:37:10.650 --> 00:37:13.800
and with two fingers
miming a scissors,

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.440
she indicated that they
had cut out her tongue.

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:20.230
Then she waved her
head to indicate

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:24.240
that we should go lest we
should witness the final horror.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:28.210
Again, I didn't move,
determined to face whatever

00:37:28.210 --> 00:37:31.360
horror they were going to
inflict and to share it

00:37:31.360 --> 00:37:33.920
insofar as I could.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.780
When Lucy saw that we
were determined to stay,

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.090
she became calm.

00:37:38.090 --> 00:37:40.520
She even broke into a smile.

00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:43.970
At first I thought it was
at us she was smiling,

00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:47.720
then she nodded her
head to direct my gaze.

00:37:47.720 --> 00:37:49.700
At the other end of
the square, the traders

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.885
were beginning to
set up their stalls.

00:37:52.885 --> 00:37:56.300
A van was delivering
milk and bread to a shop.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:59.240
Children were squatting
in a doorstep.

00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:01.350
She nodded again
to show I had not

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:06.170
detected what she was trying
to indicate, then I spotted it.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:09.725
At the base of an abutment,
squeezing out of a crevice,

00:38:09.725 --> 00:38:12.830
was a flower newly blossomed.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.440
I remember that it
was yellow but no more

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:20.740
than a weed, the kind that grows
defiantly on any wasteland.

00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:24.120
When she saw that I had
spotted it, she smiled again.

00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:26.970
She obviously saw some
significance in it

00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.440
because she kept
her eyes fixed on it

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:32.100
while the men arrived
with a can of petrol,

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.930
doused her, and set her alight.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.920
It was a horrible
sight to witness,

00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:40.740
but I did not take my eyes
off Lucy until she was dead.

00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:45.230
Insofar as I know,
neither did Peter.

00:38:45.230 --> 00:38:47.540
A couple of years later,
an attack on our camp

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.850
was imminent, and
we all scattered.

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.160
Once I was outside
and on the road,

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.700
I kept traveling,
scavenging for survival.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:58.190
I had traveled a great
distance from the camp when

00:38:58.190 --> 00:39:02.000
I came upon this shack obviously
abandoned in an earlier

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.280
campaign of the holy wars.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:07.100
I settled here and
here I am still

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.870
in this house in a
forsaken wilderness.

00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:14.550
Peter joined a band of
fighters on a random choice

00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:18.160
it would appear, and he
became the most feared fighter

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:22.240
of all in the recent
campaigns of the holy war.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.330
He was renowned
as The Silent One.

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:26.980
Unlike the others
who were always

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:30.190
boasting their
religious allegiance,

00:39:30.190 --> 00:39:33.070
bragging of their
great deeds beseeching

00:39:33.070 --> 00:39:37.400
God to favorite them in battles,
Silent One said nothing.

00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.180
He just slaughtered as many
of the opposing warriors

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:40.780
as he could.

00:39:43.310 --> 00:39:47.300
Now, they have assembled this
magnificent stage right here

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.900
in my wilderness.

00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:51.650
The world has come to my door.

00:39:51.650 --> 00:39:56.330
They expect me to give
voice to The Silent One.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:00.075
The mayor has arrived,
prancing around like a peacock.

00:40:00.075 --> 00:40:04.640
As he obsequiously ushered
me to the bank of microphones

00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:08.270
and the battery of cameras,
I am blinded by the lights.

00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:11.240
Nevertheless, notice
that the backdrop is

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.880
peppered with sponsors' logos.

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:17.300
This is clearly
major entertainment.

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:20.570
The war is the
world's entertainment,

00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:22.520
more chilling than
the nightly fictions

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.660
they watch because it is real.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:29.840
They have not come to inquire,
to learn, and to understand.

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:33.640
They have come
merely for the story.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:38.170
9:00 and they tell me the
world is watching, waiting.

00:40:38.170 --> 00:40:43.670
They ask questions, barrage me
with questions, about the camp.

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:46.085
But my mind has wandered
back to the flower

00:40:46.085 --> 00:40:51.030
that Lucy watched so intensely
as they doused her with petrol.

00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.310
Did she see it as a message
from her god, a message

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:59.220
that no matter how rampant was
the ugliness and hatred, beauty

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.875
and love would
triumph regardless.

00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:05.010
Was that why she was smiling?

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.620
I want to go back to my
hut, to close the door,

00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:08.790
and to think about this.

00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:10.590
So I get up to leave.

00:41:10.590 --> 00:41:13.140
They are going frantic
with their questions

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.850
and their frustration.

00:41:14.850 --> 00:41:17.670
But I'm getting impatient,
too, and annoyed with them.

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:19.530
I took none of their money.

00:41:19.530 --> 00:41:24.240
I owed them no explanation,
not as much as a word.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:29.280
Do they not understand that I,
too, was called The Silent One?

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:34.774
All of us who were children then
were dubbed The Silent Ones."

00:41:34.774 --> 00:41:37.666
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:41.522 --> 00:41:43.410
KATIA LYSIONAK: Thank you, Jack.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:46.120
And I think we'll all
need a minute or a second

00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.430
to absorb that.

00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:51.970
I think that's been a
very powerful, emotional,

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:55.850
and a masterful journey
in just a few pages.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.770
And I think we're going
to open our Q&amp;A session.

00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:02.500
And should we grab a chair?

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.090
Or do you think--

00:42:04.090 --> 00:42:04.590
shall we?

00:42:11.254 --> 00:42:14.240
So the plan is that I'll
ask a couple of questions.

00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:17.160
But please prepare
yours if you have any.

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.270
I'll invite you to ask a couple.

00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:25.510
And just to transition from the
story that you read out to us.

00:42:25.510 --> 00:42:27.490
As I've said, it is--

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:29.230
when I read it myself
first time when

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:34.570
I was preparing for the meeting,
I was surprised how emotional,

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:40.130
how dramatic of a story you
could tell in just a few pages.

00:42:40.130 --> 00:42:42.590
Literally you took me on
an emotional roller coaster

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:43.400
in the space of--

00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:47.760
I don't know, 3,000
words, 5,000 words at max?

00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.880
So can you tell
us a bit more why

00:42:50.880 --> 00:42:56.160
short story is such
a powerful format,

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:00.392
and why is it so
popular in Ireland?

00:43:00.392 --> 00:43:05.040
JACK HARTE: Yeah, I do think
that the short story is a very,

00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:08.270
very powerful literary form.

00:43:08.270 --> 00:43:11.840
I started out writing
poems, but as I said,

00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:13.850
I don't admit to it
anymore and certainly don't

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:15.630
show anybody any poems I wrote.

00:43:15.630 --> 00:43:19.610
'Course, once I started
writing short stories,

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:23.090
I realized that the short
story is very, very close

00:43:23.090 --> 00:43:27.410
to the poem, that it can be
just as powerful in terms

00:43:27.410 --> 00:43:29.780
of emotional intensity.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.470
And it can have the
same kind of impact.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:36.440
And the fact that
it's narrative I think

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.220
allows for greater scope
than the actual poem.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:43.105
So once I fell in love
with the short story--

00:43:43.105 --> 00:43:45.720
I was probably the early 20s--

00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:49.490
I never went back and
thought that the short story

00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:52.340
was "the" literary form.

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:54.860
I still am very much
enamored with it

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:57.965
and still obviously
write it-- a few poems.

00:43:57.965 --> 00:44:00.770
But since-- in recent
years, I have written novels

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.142
and plays and things as well.

00:44:05.142 --> 00:44:06.850
KATIA LYSIONAK: But
what's your favorite?

00:44:06.850 --> 00:44:11.000
Is it a short story still?

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.220
JACK HARTE: Probably but
as you say, I don't--

00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:14.766
I've--

00:44:14.766 --> 00:44:16.280
KATIA LYSIONAK: It's
not a trick question.

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:16.946
I don't mean to.

00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:21.710
JACK HARTE: Two novels and a
novella and five or six plays.

00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:25.940
And I'm started
on another novel.

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:32.650
So I'm not concentrating on
short stories because it is--

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:34.590
there's a problem
with the short story,

00:44:34.590 --> 00:44:38.570
and it's similar to poems that
not many people read them.

00:44:38.570 --> 00:44:41.450
So you don't really
have much of a chance

00:44:41.450 --> 00:44:43.160
of making an impact
on people if you

00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:45.230
write poems or short stories.

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.920
People talk a lot of baloney
about poems and poets

00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:50.900
when in fact,
nobody reads poetry.

00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:58.730
Nobody listens to poets except
very, very tiny following.

00:44:58.730 --> 00:45:00.780
It's almost similar
with a short story.

00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:05.700
It's a small following,
very dedicated following.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:09.500
And the problem is that the
short story demands something

00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:14.900
of the reader, that the reader
has to respond and invest

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:20.700
some cost in this creative
thing called the story.

00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.590
So the story is not something
that the writer writes

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:28.220
and the reader
sees, end of story.

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.135
It's a kind of--

00:45:30.135 --> 00:45:33.180
there's a process
which involves both,

00:45:33.180 --> 00:45:39.410
and the reader can become
emotionally involved,

00:45:39.410 --> 00:45:43.670
intellectually involved and
can use their own imagination

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:48.420
to develop aspects of
this particular story.

00:45:48.420 --> 00:45:51.530
So it's-- it has
tremendous potential,

00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:56.090
but because it's demanding, it's
not the kind of thing that you

00:45:56.090 --> 00:45:59.690
take up on the news and have
read by the time you get home.

00:45:59.690 --> 00:46:01.540
That doesn't really work.

00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:03.430
And that's why
everybody in the loos

00:46:03.430 --> 00:46:05.990
is listening to
their favorite songs

00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:08.360
rather than reading
short stories.

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:13.896
It demands work, and so you
have a small following in them.

00:46:13.896 --> 00:46:15.880
KATIA LYSIONAK: I feel
like as Googlers, we

00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:17.900
can relate to the
discussion about the short

00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:20.060
versus long copy.

00:46:20.060 --> 00:46:22.370
Those of you work
in YouTube, you're

00:46:22.370 --> 00:46:24.230
probably well aware of that.

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:26.080
So what creative works--

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:29.690
so in literary terms,
that's a conversation

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:32.840
about the short
story versus a novel.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:38.300
And Jack has mentioned that it's
such a niche group of people

00:46:38.300 --> 00:46:40.523
who actually read short story.

00:46:40.523 --> 00:46:43.520
So Jack would you be
able to maybe describe

00:46:43.520 --> 00:46:45.500
who is your reader?

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.000
Do you know?

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.570
Is it a woman?

00:46:47.570 --> 00:46:48.470
Is it a man?

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.640
Is it an older person?

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:51.350
Is it a younger person?

00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.860
What's a target
audience if I may?

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.460
JACK HARTE: Well, as I said,
the short story like the poem

00:46:59.460 --> 00:47:03.140
requires somebody who's
particularly dedicated,

00:47:03.140 --> 00:47:05.885
somebody who's prepared
to apply their minds

00:47:05.885 --> 00:47:10.330
and their imaginations to the
reading of the short story

00:47:10.330 --> 00:47:12.575
and the receiving of it.

00:47:12.575 --> 00:47:17.570
So it could be old,
young, could be anybody.

00:47:17.570 --> 00:47:21.972
I had a wonderful experience
with this particular book.

00:47:21.972 --> 00:47:27.040
I-- my plumber in--

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.340
a few weeks ago and he's
also a very good friend.

00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:33.800
When he's finished
plumbing, we always sit down

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.180
and have a coffee and
chat and usually takes

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.410
an hour of his time, which
he doesn't charge me for.

00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:44.660
But anyway, we were
talking recently,

00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.880
and he said what are
you doing these days?

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:47.766
Any other books?

00:47:47.766 --> 00:47:49.140
And said, ah,
yeah, another book.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.260
It was there, so I
said there you are.

00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:52.740
There's a present.

00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.910
So he took it away and
says I don't read books.

00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:59.305
He rang me up about
two weeks later,

00:47:59.305 --> 00:48:02.010
and he says-- do you
know what he says?

00:48:02.010 --> 00:48:03.480
I never read books.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.430
But I started reading
your book last weekend,

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:07.000
and I couldn't leave it down.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.926
[CHUCKLES]

00:48:07.926 --> 00:48:11.207
And he says, I
enjoyed it so much.

00:48:11.207 --> 00:48:12.790
And then you started
going through it.

00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:16.320
Then he had
literally analyzed it

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:19.410
and knew it from
beginning to end.

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.630
Now I would never
have imagined him--

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:26.040
my Turkish audience--
lovely fellow and that was--

00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:30.430
it turned out that, yes,
he was a wonderful reader.

00:48:30.430 --> 00:48:33.510
And taken back from his
holidays I got a text from him

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:36.540
yesterday, and he sent
me a photograph of trees

00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:41.280
and says things reminded
me of your first story

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.690
where somewhere--

00:48:42.690 --> 00:48:45.660
I forget where in the
world Spain or somewhere--

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.460
they had these
ornamental trees where

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.950
they put them into a brace to
shape them in different ways.

00:48:50.950 --> 00:48:53.520
And my first story
is about people

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:57.570
who take over the country
and convert everybody

00:48:57.570 --> 00:49:01.530
into dwarfs because they want--

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:04.940
they think that the dwarf
form is the perfect form.

00:49:04.940 --> 00:49:06.140
Anyway.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:09.060
KATIA LYSIONAK: I encourage
everyone to read that story.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:10.750
It is in your book,
and I've read it.

00:49:10.750 --> 00:49:14.730
And, again, it is powerful,
and because it's so short,

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:18.780
I feel like it's so powerful.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.300
Well, another question.

00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:23.520
So we're-- I'm going to ask you
something a bit more personal

00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:26.250
and less literature related.

00:49:26.250 --> 00:49:29.866
How does a working day
of a writer looks like.

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:33.090
JACK HARTE: You'd have to
ask every individual writer

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.130
in the country because
everybody is different.

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:39.870
Some people-- they're
lucky or whatever

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:42.540
and they get up in the morning
and they sit down at their desk

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.490
and they work for
four hours and then

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.530
have their lunch and
then another four hours

00:49:46.530 --> 00:49:50.760
and then they have their
dinner and they relax.

00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.740
Not many people do that.

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:55.140
Most writers have to
work for their living.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.819
So you'll find that there
are lots of people in Google

00:49:57.819 --> 00:49:58.485
who are writers.

00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.900
So they're working day
as they work in Google

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.690
until what time, 9 at night.

00:50:06.690 --> 00:50:08.650
[LAUGHING]

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:14.250
And when they go home at
midnight, they start writing,

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:18.540
and between midnight and 2:00
AM, they produce their work.

00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:23.010
So that's the two extremes, and
everybody else is in between.

00:50:23.010 --> 00:50:24.900
I'm not an organized
kind of person.

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:29.304
I write whenever the pressure is
on me to get something written.

00:50:29.304 --> 00:50:30.720
KATIA LYSIONAK: I
think we can all

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:35.220
relate to that, the power
of deadlines does wonders.

00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.090
Doesn't it?

00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.160
Which brings me--
that's interesting

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.010
that you've mentioned
about our own writers

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.360
that we have at Google, and
I'm sure we do, many of those.

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.610
I have the following question.

00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:49.890
So as I've read
through your bio,

00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:52.470
I couldn't help but notice
that before becoming

00:50:52.470 --> 00:50:53.910
a full-time writer,
you've worked

00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:57.060
so many jobs in your life,
among them including time

00:50:57.060 --> 00:50:59.460
in the laboratory,
civil service,

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:03.150
teaching, writing
textbooks obviously.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:06.180
Many young people these
days feel as if they

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.480
were stuck in their day job.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.340
It seems to them that
they would rather

00:51:11.340 --> 00:51:14.370
be doing something more
creative like writing a music

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.450
or writing a book
or do photography.

00:51:18.450 --> 00:51:20.610
But they have to pay
the bills and the loans

00:51:20.610 --> 00:51:24.130
and the mortgage
and student loans.

00:51:24.130 --> 00:51:27.150
So what would your message
to the young and not so young

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:33.125
people who do not find
passion in everyday job be?

00:51:33.125 --> 00:51:35.100
JACK HARTE: Again it would--

00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:37.850
every piece of advice
would be targeted

00:51:37.850 --> 00:51:39.240
at an individual person.

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.380
But broadly speaking, I do
not encourage young writers

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.400
to assume that being
a full-time writer

00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:49.330
is the answer to everything.

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:50.300
It generally isn't.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:56.380
I recommend people to have
jobs to experience life,

00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.900
and then when they have built
up a bank of experience,

00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:01.710
they can write.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:03.270
You can't write out of nothing.

00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:06.730
The idea you'd love
finishing university,

00:52:06.730 --> 00:52:10.380
go and sitting in a
room all day every day

00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:12.610
writing full-time just nonsense.

00:52:12.610 --> 00:52:14.840
It's absolute nonsense.

00:52:14.840 --> 00:52:19.010
Now it might seem strange
coming from somebody

00:52:19.010 --> 00:52:20.880
who started the Irish
Writers' Union, et

00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:24.030
cetera, et cetera
trying to establish

00:52:24.030 --> 00:52:26.880
writing as a profession.

00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:32.790
What I feel is that writing
should be adequately rewarded.

00:52:32.790 --> 00:52:38.820
If you write a novel today,
if you get it published,

00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:42.060
you might get 2,000 Euro for it.

00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:45.180
If you're very lucky,
you might get 5,000.

00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:50.320
These high profile
people who get 100,000,

00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.130
they're as rare as hen's teeth.

00:52:53.130 --> 00:52:56.280
There are only a few of them.

00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:00.380
So writing is not
adequately rewarded.

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:03.770
Now the cynic will
answer oh, yeah,

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:05.330
but you take it to
the marketplace,

00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:07.380
you sell it for what it's worth.

00:53:07.380 --> 00:53:08.460
That isn't true.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.110
That isn't true at all.

00:53:10.110 --> 00:53:17.730
This country owes an incredible
amount of money to writers.

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:22.290
Look at all the money that James
Joyce brings into this country.

00:53:22.290 --> 00:53:25.560
James Joyce, whom this
country, this government,

00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.650
our government, wouldn't
repatriate his body

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:29.890
when he died.

00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.070
He died in Zurich.

00:53:32.070 --> 00:53:33.330
He's buried in Zurich.

00:53:33.330 --> 00:53:35.580
And in one stage, his
family made an approach

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:39.000
to the government to see
if they would bring back

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.430
his body the same way
as they brought back

00:53:41.430 --> 00:53:43.080
William Buckley Yates.

00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.675
They wouldn't.

00:53:44.675 --> 00:53:49.730
But now James Joyce is
the major money raiser,

00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:53.910
so they celebrate Bloomsday
and blah, blah, blah.

00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:59.700
So the state is
dependent on writers,

00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.790
but they have total contempt.

00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:04.310
Like when they talk
about arts funding,

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:06.130
they'll say aren't we wonderful.

00:54:06.130 --> 00:54:10.706
We spend so much in
funding the arts.

00:54:10.706 --> 00:54:11.620
Give me a rest.

00:54:11.620 --> 00:54:15.710
It's the arts that are funding
the government, the arts that

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:18.380
are keeping the country afloat.

00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:22.940
Don't give me this rubbish
about how generous the state is

00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:24.320
in funding the arts.

00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.120
It isn't.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:29.520
Now if people were
rewarded for their work,

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:33.710
they might be able
to more easily become

00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:35.270
professional writers--

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:37.840
full-time writers eventually.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.000
But as a piece of
advice, I say, look,

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.750
you have to pay your
bills as you've said.

00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:42.874
You have to pay your bills.

00:54:42.874 --> 00:54:46.050
You have to look at
things in a sensible way.

00:54:46.050 --> 00:54:47.710
You also have to get experience.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:49.940
I would say that straight
away to young people.

00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.510
Get experience.

00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:56.100
And build up-- look
on it in two ways.

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.570
This is the job you do
in order to earn money.

00:54:59.570 --> 00:55:02.930
This is what you
want to finance.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:04.760
So how much time do
you have to spend

00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:08.230
at that job or a job in
order to finance that--

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.970
work it out, just
a balance sheet.

00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:16.460
And get it as well balanced
as you possibly can.

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:20.120
And then you can work
your way towards spending

00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.791
more and more time at your
writing, your music, your

00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:25.875
whatever you're doing.

00:55:25.875 --> 00:55:28.670
KATIA LYSIONAK: I think I
absolutely love that answer.

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:29.870
I would vote for you.

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.100
If you were to start a program--

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:37.010
arts funds-- arts fund
state, I'd so vote for that.

00:55:37.010 --> 00:55:39.940
And I also feel that
we're running out of time.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:42.770
We're slightly over schedule.

00:55:42.770 --> 00:55:44.690
I've promised I'm going
to take questions.

00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:46.490
Let's limited to
one, two questions.

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:50.180
Does anyone have
a burning desire?

00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:51.640
Please do ask?

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.190
AUDIENCE: Hey, you said you
started the Irish Writers'

00:55:54.190 --> 00:55:56.773
Centre as a way of gathering the
community together because it

00:55:56.773 --> 00:55:57.830
was quite fragmented.

00:55:57.830 --> 00:55:59.480
But even now today,
it is still quite

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:02.420
fragmented with the Writer
Centre, the Smoke Factory,

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:04.610
and Books Upstairs, New Theatre.

00:56:04.610 --> 00:56:07.160
They all have good support
networks for new writers,

00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.010
but they don't seem to
work together or create

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:10.931
that network.

00:56:10.931 --> 00:56:12.680
Do you see that landscape
changing at all,

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.760
or do you think that's just the
way it's always going to be?

00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:19.100
JACK HARTE: No, I think
there's far more coordination

00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:19.870
than you imagine.

00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:25.740
Yeah, there are all these
outlets now, and that's great.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:28.220
So say, for example,
open mic sessions,

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.720
they one in the Writers' Centre
and they have one in wherever--

00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.050
half a dozen around the city.

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:35.210
That doesn't mean
they're in competition.

00:56:35.210 --> 00:56:37.610
That means they're
just more options

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.890
for writers, which is great.

00:56:39.890 --> 00:56:46.160
I don't think-- say when I went
back to the Centre in 2009,

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.440
there was a fairly
poisonous atmosphere,

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.220
and organizations
hated each other.

00:56:53.220 --> 00:56:55.970
And one of the first
things that I did was

00:56:55.970 --> 00:57:01.070
try to open up conversations
with different organizations.

00:57:01.070 --> 00:57:05.520
And we established a kind
of network of organizations,

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:09.320
and we actually went in
and made a presentation

00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.160
to the [INAUDIBLE] in
[INAUDIBLE] one time.

00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:17.490
And so it's not as fragmented
as it would appear.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:20.840
Obviously, there
will always be groups

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.705
and maybe there'll
be an opposition

00:57:22.705 --> 00:57:24.350
and they won't like each other.

00:57:24.350 --> 00:57:29.120
I don't think it's
quite as competitive I

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:32.913
think it's far more
cooperative than appears.

00:57:32.913 --> 00:57:34.290
KATIA LYSIONAK: Thank you.

00:57:34.290 --> 00:57:35.810
Thank you for asking a question.

00:57:35.810 --> 00:57:38.990
I think we will limit
it to one question.

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:40.940
And I'm really sorry about that.

00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.280
I have a long list that
I wanted to ask Jack,

00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:47.990
but I think we'll have
to do it the next time.

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:51.620
I'd like to close this
session with that quick quote

00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:56.150
from the book that we all have.

00:57:56.150 --> 00:57:59.240
And I challenge you to find
an answer to the question

00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:02.880
that I'm going to pose in
the book or in your life.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:05.660
So the main character
in the book,

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:09.980
Zaya, teaches his people
to achieve satisfaction

00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:13.720
in life, not happiness.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.740
Why not happiness
but satisfaction?

00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:20.880
That is the question I'm
going to leave hanging out

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.790
there because I think that
our generation sometimes

00:58:24.790 --> 00:58:29.730
is overly all about happiness.

00:58:29.730 --> 00:58:31.740
Instagram is about happiness.

00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.810
Our meditation is
about happiness.

00:58:33.810 --> 00:58:37.410
And I loved that question
because I can relate to that,

00:58:37.410 --> 00:58:39.150
and I hope you can, too.

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:40.576
Thank you for today's session.

00:58:40.576 --> 00:58:41.700
Jack, thank you for coming.

00:58:41.700 --> 00:58:44.750
[APPLAUSE]
