TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi,
I'm Timothy Jordan,

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.733
and this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:07.930
from Google in the last week.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.790
LinkedIn uses Android Studio
to build high quality Android

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.290
apps.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.470
To hear their protips, visit
the link for the video.

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.570
Guetzli is a new
open source algorithm

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.740
that creates high quality JPEG
images with file sizes 35%

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.860
smaller than currently
available methods.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.270
A link to the GitHub
is on the post.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.120
The WebGL JavaScript
API exposes hardware

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.580
accelerated 3D
graphics to the web.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.450
Chrome 56 brings support for
WebGL 2.0, a major upgrade

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.390
to the API, which unlocks
a variety of new graphics

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.580
features and advanced
rendering techniques.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.840
To get started with WebGL 2.0,
check out the WebGL 2.0 samples

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.490
pack linked from the post.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.800
We are releasing a major
upgrade to SyntaxNet.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.480
It incorporates nearly a
year's worth of our research

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.820
on multilingual
language understanding

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.850
and is available to anyone
interested in building systems

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.760
for processing and
understanding text.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.120
To learn more about SyntaxNet
or a new multilingual parsing

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.610
competition, check out the post.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.870
Science isn't just about
discovering new results.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.050
It's also about
human understanding.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:13.465
That's why, in collaboration
with OpenAI, DeepMind,

00:01:13.465 --> 00:01:16.390
YC Research and others,
we're excited to announce

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.540
the launch of Distill, a
new open source science

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
journal and ecosystem supporting
human understanding of machine

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.040
learning.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.000
Distill is an
independent organization

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.670
dedicated to fostering a
new segment of the research

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:28.450
community.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.490
Follow the link to
see the overview page

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.370
or read the latest articles.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.750
You can now get
insights into how

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.910
your Firebase realtime
database instance is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.320
performing by using the profiler
built into the Firebase CLI.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.140
That means you can now easily
monitor your database writes

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.350
and reads at the path level,
collecting granular data

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.430
on bandwidth usage and speed.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.240
Screenshots are on the post.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.130
In the past few weeks,
AdMob has rolled out

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.040
support for video assets
in Native Ads Express,

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.010
giving you a new way to create
more engaging presentations

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.060

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.460
Code and a video
are on the post.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.950
