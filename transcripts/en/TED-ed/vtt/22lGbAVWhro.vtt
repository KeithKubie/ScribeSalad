00:00:06.746 --> 00:00:10.129
Imagine something small enough to float
on a particle of dust

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:15.946
that holds the keys to understanding
cancer, virology, and genetics.

00:00:15.946 --> 00:00:17.075
Luckily for us,

00:00:17.075 --> 00:00:20.324
such a thing exists in the form 
of trillions upon trillions

00:00:20.324 --> 00:00:24.606
of human lab-grown cells
called HeLa.

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:26.696
Let's take a step back for a second.

00:00:26.696 --> 00:00:30.535
Scientists grow human cells in the lab
to study how they function,

00:00:30.535 --> 00:00:32.529
understand how diseases develop,

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.750
and test new treatments without
endangering patients.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.005
To make sure that they can repeat
these experiments over and over,

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.696
and compare the results 
with other scientists,

00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:44.311
they need huge populations 
of identical cells

00:00:44.311 --> 00:00:47.269
that can duplicate themselves 
faithfully for years,

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:51.817
but until 1951, all human cell lines
that researchers tried to grow

00:00:51.817 --> 00:00:54.093
had died after a few days.

00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:57.050
Then a John Hopkins scientist
named George Gey

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.389
received a sample of 
a strange looking tumor:

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:04.195
dark purple, shiny, jelly-like.

00:01:04.195 --> 00:01:05.714
This sample was special.

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:07.949
Some of its cells just kept dividing,

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:09.032
and dividing,

00:01:09.032 --> 00:01:10.571
and dividing.

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.311
When individual cells died,

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:16.171
generations of copies took their place
and thrived.

00:01:16.171 --> 00:01:21.385
The result was an endless source of
identical cells that's still around today.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:24.894
The very first immortal human cell line.

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:30.532
Gey labeled it "HeLa" after the patient
with the unusual tumor, Henrietta Lacks.

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:32.624
Born on a tobacco farm in Virginia,

00:01:32.624 --> 00:01:35.618
she lived in Baltimore with her husband
and five children.

00:01:35.618 --> 00:01:38.043
She died of aggressive cervical cancer

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.903
a few months after her tumorous cells
were harvested,

00:01:40.903 --> 00:01:43.154
and she never knew about them.

00:01:43.154 --> 00:01:46.076
So what's so special about the cells
from Henrietta Lacks

00:01:46.076 --> 00:01:49.621
that lets them survive
when other cell lines die?

00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:53.066
The short answer is
we don't entirely know.

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:56.115
Normal human cells have built-in
control mechanisms.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:59.818
They can divide about 50 times
before they self destruct

00:01:59.818 --> 00:02:02.330
in a process called apoptosis.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.654
This prevents the propagation
of genetic errors

00:02:04.654 --> 00:02:07.877
that creep in after 
repeated rounds of division.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:11.279
But cancer cells ignore these signals,
dividing indefinitely

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:13.466
and crowding out normal cells.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:18.970
Still, most cell lines eventually die off,
especially outside the human body.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.996
Not HeLa, though, and that's the part
we can't yet explain.

00:02:22.996 --> 00:02:28.238
Regardless, when Dr. Gey realized he had
the first immortal line of human cells,

00:02:28.238 --> 00:02:31.237
he sent samples 
to labs all over the world.

00:02:31.237 --> 00:02:33.584
Soon the world's first 
cell production facility

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:37.065
was churning out 
6 trillion HeLa cells a week,

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:41.469
and scientists put them to work
in an ethically problematic way,

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.209
building careers and fortunes
off of Henrietta's cells

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.843
without her or her family's consent,
or even knowledge until decades later.

00:02:49.843 --> 00:02:53.972
The polio epidemic was at its peak
in the early 50s.

00:02:53.972 --> 00:02:57.374
HeLa cells, which easily took up
and replicated the virus,

00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:00.879
allowed Jonas Salk to test his vaccine.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:02.627
They've been used to study diseases,

00:03:02.627 --> 00:03:03.713
including measles,

00:03:03.713 --> 00:03:04.704
mumps,

00:03:04.704 --> 00:03:05.774
HIV,

00:03:05.774 --> 00:03:07.381
and ebola.

00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:09.670
We know that human 
cells have 46 chromosomes

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.242
because a scientist working with HeLa
discovered a chemcial

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:15.598
that makes chromosomes visible.

00:03:15.598 --> 00:03:20.573
HeLa cells themselves actually have
around 80 highly mutated chromosomes.

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:24.543
HeLa cells were the first to be cloned.

00:03:24.543 --> 00:03:27.271
They've traveled to outer space.

00:03:27.271 --> 00:03:28.347
Telomerase,

00:03:28.347 --> 00:03:32.587
an enzyme that helps cancer cells evade
destruction by repairing their DNA,

00:03:32.587 --> 00:03:34.873
was discovered first in HeLa cells.

00:03:34.873 --> 00:03:36.520
In an interesting turn of fate,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.018
thanks to HeLa, we know that cervical
cancer can be caused by a virus called HPV

00:03:42.018 --> 00:03:44.557
and now there's a vaccine.

00:03:44.557 --> 00:03:48.843
HeLa-fueled discoveries have filled
thousands of scientific papers,

00:03:48.843 --> 00:03:52.251
and that number is probably even higher
than anyone knows.

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:57.052
HeLa cells are so resilient that they 
can travel on almost any surface:

00:03:57.052 --> 00:03:58.942
a lab worker's hand,

00:03:58.942 --> 00:04:00.782
a piece of dust,

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:05.283
invading cultures of other cells 
and taking over like weeds,

00:04:05.283 --> 00:04:10.879
countless cures, patents and discoveries
all made thanks to Henrieta Lacks.
