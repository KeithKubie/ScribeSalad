00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.950
There's something else we need to talk
about before you start writing code.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.110
Go ahead and download the starter code
project for my favorite movies and

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.240
then open up the info.plist file.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.444
I believe it's located in
supporting files &gt; info.plist.

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:18.087
Remember how we had to modify
the info.plist file in the image

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:18.935
request app?

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:23.855
This accounted for
images that used HTTP instead of HTTPS.

00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:28.594
Well, as of now the movie database
also relies on HTTP to actually

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:31.881
make some of its request for
images and such.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:35.941
And to adhere to Apple's ATS standards,
this just won't cut it, so

00:00:35.941 --> 00:00:38.955
we've made some changes
to the info.plist file.

00:00:40.455 --> 00:00:44.065
And we'll collapse out the at
transport security settings.

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:48.426
And let's just collapse all these so
you can see everything.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.814
Instead of allowing arbitrary loads,
like we did in the image request app,

00:00:54.814 --> 00:00:59.075
and remember, this looked like we'd
go here, allow arbitrary loads, yes.

00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:03.406
So this property, we've gotten rid of,
we don't need this property anymore.

00:01:03.406 --> 00:01:06.863
To do this, we've used
the exception domains dictionary,

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:11.620
which in itself contains dictionaries
for each domain that the API uses.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.830
And for each domain,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.690
we can specify that we want to allow
it to use insecure HTTP loads.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.910
Now I know some of these key value
pairs you haven't seen before, but

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.060
it's not really important that I
get into all of them right now.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.750
The only one that I want to point
out is NSIncludesSubdomains.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.710
This key provides a boolean that says
whether or not you want settings of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.690
a domain, say like cloudfront.net
to apply to all of it's subdomains.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.636
A subdomain is an extension to
a domain name that's used to organize

00:01:41.636 --> 00:01:43.301
resources together.

00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:46.640
For instance,
udacity.com is a domain, and

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.985
it has the subdomain review.udacity.com.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.856
On review.udacity.com,
you'll find webpages, images, and

00:01:53.856 --> 00:01:58.060
other resources that are related
to Udacity project reviews.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.626
So if we were to set
NSIncludesSubdomains to yes for

00:02:01.626 --> 00:02:06.820
udacity.com in our info.plist file, that
means we'd want to extend any settings

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.002
of udacity.com to all its subdomains,
like review.udacity.com,

00:02:12.002 --> 00:02:16.050
discussions.udacity.com and any others.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.190
I just wanted to make you aware that
these properties have been updated for

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.680
my favorite movies.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.050
If you want to read more
about these properties,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.850
the ones that you can use for ATS, I've
posted a link in the instructor notes.
