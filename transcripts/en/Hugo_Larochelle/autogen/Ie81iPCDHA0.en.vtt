00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.990
 in this capsule we will see how 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:10.170
 smoothing in a hlm 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:14.870
 so we saw that we could calculate the 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:20.820
 marginal probability of a sequence so 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:22.920
 pds 1 to miss from a 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 dynamic programming we compute a 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.420
 alpha chart and that this table al 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:33.899
 fallah can also be used to make 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.870
 the calculation of the state beliefs so do 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.090
 of filtering now let's see a 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.770
 other way another dynamic program 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.280
 which will also allow us to 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.559
 calculate the marginal probability of a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.680
 sequence but it will be done this time 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.079
 here in a right sweep towards the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.809
 left and in fact we will see that this 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.250
 other dynamic program there is power 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.050
 be combined with the one we 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.820
 gave alpha for smoothing 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.890
 so will again define a 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.659
 table this time we will call it 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.790
 beta and this chart there it will contain some 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.130
 values ​​that will allow us 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.549
 possibly to do is calculate the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:20.700
 marginal producti or to make the message 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:23.939
 we will define beta it and as being the 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.280
 probability of the observed sequence of 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.790
 the instat and +1 until the end of the 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.030
 sequence 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:34.590
 since it is assumed that bought 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.560
 is equal it is given in 1 10 here it's going 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 to be the definition of beta yet another 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 time we will define a recursion that will 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.820
 allow us to make the connection between the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.689
 beta of a column with the beta 2 of a 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.130
 adjacent column 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.590
 but here in this case we will go from 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.840
 right to the left so we'll do 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.329
 depend on the column to witness to write it 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.229
 in a form that involves the column to 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:03.540
 right so the column t then we have by 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 definition of beat it is not as good as 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.170
 it's equal to this distribution here here 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.319
 so it's the same thing that we have 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.950
 here my place of t on to the witnesses are 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.170
 so that gives 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.860
 the atheist until Iran 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.330
 on the place of theo our witness has 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.560
 then saab a bit like we did 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:27.959
 with the alpha table we will introduce 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:31.890
 a buy variable that we will fix at j 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:35.220
 then we will have the distribution of 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.230
 s endowed up big t bought equal to 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.239
 10 am to buy less one of the galleries 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.610
 but we will summon all the values 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.470
 past lookout of the buy variable 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.120
 so we're going to marginalize her so we 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.410
 have equality between those here 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.790
 now following from his right everything 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.530
 that I do it's managed written the same 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.069
 distribution but I'm going to separate the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.060
 sequence endowed up grant and in one 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.590
 tea bouquet +1 up to great tea and 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:06.000
 I'll only isolate the observation 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.040
 time to test here we still bought some 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.220
 galas j for conditions still buy 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.200
 less equal and when one has made 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:20.670
 general way are a distribution where 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:23.820
 we paid 2 x diop and x1 x2 x3 sacha 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:27.750
 ex four years that if we can always the 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:36.780
 rewrite as the peace product of x 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:39.200
 sasha ex 4 xp ii x2 sacha xx th and x 4 x 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.359
 p ii x3 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:47.579
 sacha x1 x2 and x4 so it's a little 

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:49.769
 the equivalent we previously the 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.970
 last capsule we wrote I had 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.170
 write the same thing but I'm not going 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.000
 given ex cat 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.859
 so it's the same thing but I 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.380
 added the flaws of an ex cat everywhere he 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:00.359
 here is here here and here 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.579
 ok so it's the same rule of chaining 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:05.040
 but applied in a cocoon conditions 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.130
 on something when if we have to 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.650
 continue on this variable everywhere 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.870
 in the conditionals here 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.849
 so we will apply this equivalent of 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.780
 this rule there so in this case I 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.489
 will start by taking so my 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.500
 book to me and who are here it's going to be 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.820
 bought and equals acts so I 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.820
 actually the product of the 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.039
 probability of https gala j sacha bought 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.720
 less than 1 of the galleries that is here here 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.539
 it's the German equivalent ex cap in 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.539
 my formula after that I'll take 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:43.289
 the document and kz2 is it going to be is it 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:44.970
 more until we scratch that we have here and 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.590
 there normally we should have his 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.720
 luck 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:51.090
 https gala j who were here it's eric 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.070
 dermont experts in my formula and I 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:55.949
 should have excited my ex witnesses and 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.110
 eygalayes also here however we have 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:03.360
 that this has gala https has the sequence of 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.930
 tea +1 up to 10 the observed sequence 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:13.530
 was dependent on ht - is equal to 1 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:20.910
 why so here we have witnessed 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:26.159
 healthy in our tasks and even we at htc 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.330
 after that we went further by the 

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:33.470
 drink continue to eventually 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:36.409
 place them up to st that's going to be more 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:39.860
 far over here so now if 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.379
 I watch buy all the paths between 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.330
 buy less hours and all that to 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:47.419
 right here so have them mentioned above 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.849
 up to s40 and all those paths there are going 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:54.050
 to be blocked by buying and therefore being 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:56.330
 given hts quote +1 up is big and 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.740
 is independent bought less than to so to 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.020
 because of that here I can condition 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.819
 only on possible forgiveness here I 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.650
 can only pack on purchased 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:11.060
 I do not need to have bought at least one 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.979
 year so that explains this conditional 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.440
 there and now the conditional here 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.090
 but it implies the other term that 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:20.810
 I had here that only involves is 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:23.360
 quoted so we stayed here and again a 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:27.319
 times we will see there is no longer wise 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:30.889
 up to grant and neither nor buy less 1 

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:33.349
 why so no is he here here we 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:35.360
 would have incited and once again all 

00:06:33.349 --> 00:06:37.250
 the paths if I know buy all 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.129
 the paths that will be 2h witness a 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:45.500
 up to or steppes alone 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:46.940
 or until that big green tea is and so 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.580
 all these games but the water that goes through 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.849
 buy will be blocked if I know 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.319
 buy because of them so because of this 

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:56.960
 we know what we know about 

00:06:54.319 --> 00:06:59.180
 separations and so because of that I 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.830
 can actually write the conditional of 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.029
 stay I can condition it only 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.310
 on ht is equal to dropping our recipes 

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:10.009
 explain this line if we had 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.199
 conditional a bit more simplified and 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:15.889
 then finally we notice all this here 

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:18.440
 it actually corresponds to beta jt this is the 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:22.909
 definition of veto jt so we managed to 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:25.479
 written in a recursive form and for 

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:28.430
 what it has initial value verdasco 6 

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:31.069
 beta yg annuity and we will use it a 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.060
 indicated fectively if one has very 

00:07:31.069 --> 00:07:37.069
 big and not at all it's like 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.330
 if we had nothing here then the condition 

00:07:37.069 --> 00:07:40.330
 initialization is 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.460
 once we have calculated our table p 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:49.410
 and hop again we have another 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.849
 procedure to calculate the policy 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.919
 marginal of the entire sequence 

00:07:50.849 --> 00:07:55.830
 actually it's marginal product 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:57.780
 it can be written by inserting h is 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:59.520
 equal to jp right now on all these 

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.949
 possible values ​​so a marginal 12 to 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.479
 agen 

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:04.289
 now it's projecting here we can 

00:08:03.479 --> 00:08:07.139
 drive 

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:09.810
 we can break it down as follows 

00:08:07.139 --> 00:08:11.580
 probability of the sequence from 

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:14.490
 two until the end sacha h 

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:18.330
 one of the guys there j times the probability of 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:23.220
 s1 knowing he bought gala j times 

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:24.780
 probability of hrt galère is therefore acting so 

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.780
 that's just it's from the 

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:29.729
 decomposition in a hlm and we observe 

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:36.360
 whether it's here it's actually 

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:37.919
 beto j so we'll have a sum where we 

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:40.080
 will have knocked on all the elements 

00:08:37.919 --> 00:08:42.300
 beta but they're going to be weighted by this 

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:47.760
 term the narrative that makes it a priority 

00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:50.760
 to sing it gala j and s is equal if s 

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.380
 end of the sequence so observe with the 

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:54.839
 concrete board one is also able to 

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.000
 calculate this marginal probity here and there 

00:08:54.839 --> 00:08:59.940
 we have a dynamic program that starts from 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.320
 the right one goes initialized to grant and 

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.920
 the last column then we will go 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:10.140
 to the first column using 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:11.850
 this recursion here here we do a 

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.300
 example yet fondant example where we have 

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:17.970
 a message that contains 4 bits that are 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:19.680
 transmitted and we observe the version 

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:23.640
 noisy of those goals there 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:25.680
 so the message of 0.001 in this case 

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:30.200
 we noted initialization at the first 

00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.200
 column that is silly is equal to 1 

00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:38.120
 outside we use our foray to 

00:09:35.279 --> 00:09:40.800
 use the column to the right to 

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:42.959
 calculate the adjacent column on the left 

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:44.879
 we simply have our formula of 

00:09:42.959 --> 00:09:50.459
 recursion here we just apply it 

00:09:44.879 --> 00:09:52.439
 for your is equal to 4 what we get 

00:09:50.459 --> 00:09:54.389
 it's the next thing so we combine 

00:09:52.439 --> 00:09:59.430
 all the elements in the last column 

00:09:54.389 --> 00:10:02.550
 beta 0 4 beta 1 4 each of these elements 

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:04.980
 are multiplied by the probability that 

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:07.939
 from h3 that is equal to zero or 

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:10.769
 choir vah 4 is equal to zero 

00:10:07.939 --> 00:10:12.480
 so that's what we multiply by bt 

00:10:10.769 --> 00:10:16.800
 also multiplies by the probability 

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:17.370
 that at h4 equal to zero i observe at s4 is 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.769
 equal to 1 

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:23.279
 so that's because it's that 

00:10:19.769 --> 00:10:26.670
 that I observed so in a similar way 

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:29.670
 here we multiplied time 1 4 by h3t 

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.579
 gala 0 during the probity of h4d gallas 

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:33.720
 at shanghai h3 is equal to zero 

00:10:31.579 --> 00:10:37.019
 I'm told it's also by the 

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:39.959
 probability that s4 equals 1 knowing 

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:43.559
 that h4 is equal to a boxer 

00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:47.970
 actually it's the body h4 is equal 

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:50.459
 at 1 then the term that implies beta 04 

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:55.230
 it's the terms associated with h4 equals 

00:10:50.459 --> 00:10:57.029
 to zero and so we proceed for that it is 

00:10:55.230 --> 00:11:00.569
 simply write the recursion rule 

00:10:57.029 --> 00:11:02.279
 ponote precise examples we go in place 

00:11:00.569 --> 00:11:05.790
 by the probabilities that they are required 

00:11:02.279 --> 00:11:11.550
 in our tables just upstairs and that's me 

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:14.910
 gives 0.59 done picture and one here as well 

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:19.319
 for the two betas 0.3 this is the 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:23.699
 priority of being at 0 so many witnesses and 

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:28.050
 to be at 0 at the tents and then 0.16 the 

00:11:23.699 --> 00:11:31.319
 probability if I have h 4 to 0 to observe 

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:35.029
 galt galley as I am a way 

00:11:31.319 --> 00:11:39.360
 lighting and 0.7 which is here so to be 

00:11:35.029 --> 00:11:46.060
 h3d gala 0 then art vh cat equal to 1 and 

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:52.750
 x the probability that if h4 is equal to 1 

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:57.670
 that s 4 be equal to who come the 

00:11:52.750 --> 00:12:00.190
 observed sequence I'm doing the same thing 

00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:02.320
 for the second element of the third 

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:05.260
 column so that's the case now 

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:11.130
 or h3 rather than supposed that is 

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:11.130
 equal to 1 to 0 one arises who is equal to 1 

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:18.610
 we replace and insert in the table 

00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:21.630
 and we continue like that for all 

00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:24.190
 columns so I do it quickly 

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:26.140
 if you want to have the details the to 

00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:28.210
 positives are on the website I you 

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:30.370
 encourage to do in detail if you 

00:12:28.210 --> 00:12:33.360
 did not understand the procedure for 

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:35.620
 to target the procedure of the beta table 

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:39.070
 so we do that until we arrive 

00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:43.870
 in the head therefore equal that we filled all 

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:45.490
 the columns of our beta table then 

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:50.170
 one thing we will do with the painting 

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:52.990
 beta general rule the main purpose 

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:55.210
 it is to do the smoothing that is to say 

00:12:52.990 --> 00:12:57.340
 to calculate given a whole 

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:59.710
 sequence of the first moment until 

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:02.770
 last 2-1 until grown up 

00:12:59.710 --> 00:13:04.630
 what is our scope a posteriori for 

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.570
 any is to hide at any 

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:10.930
 what moment in the co can be either a 

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:14.680
 be grown from can vary from 1 up to 

00:13:10.930 --> 00:13:17.800
 grant so this is equal to 1 a 

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.240
 value possible and it is actually 

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:22.240
 that it's going to take a very simple form 

00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:24.880
 we will simply multiply the alfa to 

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:27.970
 the body column times the betas to the 

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:30.280
 column case then we see normalized so 

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:32.080
 here the gamma is to be simply the 

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:34.240
 sum to end here but for 

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:35.950
 all target hypo values ​​is the 

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:40.450
 why we get his safety 

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:42.430
 so by we can simply rewrite 

00:13:40.450 --> 00:13:44.830
 this conditional here is it 

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:46.770
 posterior here as and to the probability 

00:13:44.830 --> 00:13:50.980
 attached on all elements namely 

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:54.310
 hk and here I separated the sequence from the 

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:57.040
 part 2-1 up to body and two kops 1 

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:58.870
 until grant is here and so that's 

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.440
 just the conditional site the ai 

00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.600
 6th 

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.170
 this posteriori if it's just the 

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:06.940
 mare the adjoined especially the all 

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:10.780
 random variables / a constant of 

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.340
 normalization is now so that 

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:16.180
 joined it can be divided as 

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:18.970
 follow one to the marginal probity 2h side 

00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:22.300
 gallery and sequence up to 2 1 

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:24.790
 up to the observed sequence times the 

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.160
 probability of the rest of the sequence 

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:28.930
 given only buy gala is 

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.820
 so normal we would have expected in the 

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:32.020
 general case to have one here also 

00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:35.740
 the term 

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.810
 here the sequence from 1 to small body 

00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:40.660
 but again because the 

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:43.630
 paths are blocked by h as we have a 

00:14:40.660 --> 00:14:45.160
 independent this conditional between 

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:47.560
 elements of the norge coop sequence 

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:49.450
 cac 40 is and the elements of the 

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.970
 sequence of 1 up to body if we 

00:14:49.450 --> 00:14:56.710
 knows where if we assume a value 

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:58.090
 for the state hidden next so with the 

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.700
 same reasoning we used 

00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:01.270
 previously we can get to these 

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.050
 results 

00:15:01.270 --> 00:15:09.690
 and that here it corresponds to alpha then that 

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:09.690
 here it corresponds to beta simply 

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.640
 here is an example are used to 

00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.710
 tables once we took calculated in 

00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:19.870
 the previous capsule and beta is suitable 

00:15:17.710 --> 00:15:20.470
 to calculate and that one is interested in the 

00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:22.540
 policy 

00:15:20.470 --> 00:15:24.250
 h2 is equal to zero given all 

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:25.900
 our calvi sequence says we received 

00:15:24.250 --> 00:15:28.090
 actually all we have to do 

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.880
 it's taking element by element 

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:32.530
 multiplication of his faith this for the 

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.380
 numerator so we see here 

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:39.400
 then we divide by the constant of 

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:45.640
 normalization that is seen that we see 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:48.400
 here more his faith that we see here and that 

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:50.650
 it gives me the probability for example 

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:53.260
 here in fact we wonder what 

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:57.640
 is the probability that h2 is equal to 

00:15:53.260 --> 00:16:00.010
 zero so the second to the second star 

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.710
 we are indeed that the variable 

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.600
 hide 

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:04.740
 that hidden variables yes h so the 

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:07.230
 message they want is sent 

00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:08.790
 it was really a beat 2 0 and in 

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.170
 what we see is that the 

00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:12.390
 probability is still high 

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:14.340
 the policy is hd is equal to 1 

00:16:12.390 --> 00:16:16.980
 so the inverted still so high is 

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:19.080
 still close to 40 for that and that 

00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:21.630
 it's due to the fact that in fact the way 

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.480
 that we have defined our hmm we have a 

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.320
 probability it is expected that the 

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:28.380
 nobody they send messages 

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.010
 alternates more often between 0 and 1 rather 

00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:33.510
 than to have 3 0 in a row and because of 

00:16:32.010 --> 00:16:35.790
 this increases a little more the 

00:16:33.510 --> 00:16:38.910
 probability that made there was a noise 

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:40.400
 since what makes the person no 

00:16:38.910 --> 00:16:43.320
 you see rather 

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:46.280
 she wanted to send her galley instead 

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.080
 that age 2 is equal to zero 

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:54.240
 so that's an example of a calculation of 

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:55.770
 smoothing in a hlm and I'm just doing 

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:58.440
 mentioned quickly that we can 

00:16:55.770 --> 00:16:59.610
 also make face on two 

00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:01.790
 variables at the same time ie 

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:04.410
 wonder about the pastor producer 

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:06.959
 posterior that hk take some 

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:09.660
 value and that at most 1 takes a 

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:13.620
 other value so there a posterior but 

00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:17.240
 seal on two variables hk so for a 

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:20.160
 given shot and the hidden variables to 

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.780
 the next moment and again 

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:24.990
 are your powers the calculated from 

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:26.459
 alfa and betas the math is a 

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:29.810
 little bit more complicated but still 

00:17:26.459 --> 00:17:32.600
 not that much so we only have seven 

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:37.320
 conditional there we can write it as 

00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:39.390
 a marginalized here normalized or the 

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.790
 standardization constant range to 

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:44.040
 bonuses it's constant we have to summit 

00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:45.900
 on if i because we want our 

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.470
 later are a game if we have some 

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:51.890
 on all the values ​​of there being of j 

00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:55.500
 call times I know paris from 

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:58.280
 so between the sequence of 1 up and 

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:00.120
 two kops hours up to grant is 

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:02.760
 now all this conditional 

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.060
 peeled lodge decomposed as the probability 

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:08.660
 marginal 2h fart galassi and the 

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:12.960
 sequence observed from 1 until when 

00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:15.149
 next of that I have the probability that h 

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:18.469
 cup +1 be equal 

00:18:15.149 --> 00:18:20.369
 j sacha cash cost equal to y 

00:18:18.469 --> 00:18:23.460
 so actually if I know 

00:18:20.369 --> 00:18:25.440
 buyer is equal to 10 pm cup the spell does 

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:29.219
 does not depend on the observed sequence 

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:32.129
 until little body after that I have 

00:18:29.219 --> 00:18:34.649
 the skin wrestles and that's blood kop has been 

00:18:32.129 --> 00:18:37.940
 generated from h cup the only one who 

00:18:34.649 --> 00:18:42.839
 is equal to hadji that sends with the 

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:45.330
 conditional dependence properties on 

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:47.190
 that here politics as well as the more 

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:49.349
 we only depend on simpler cups 

00:18:47.190 --> 00:18:51.869
 is finally part of the buyers more 

00:18:49.349 --> 00:18:54.479
 healthy we must also increase probity 

00:18:51.869 --> 00:18:58.830
 to have generated all the rest of the 

00:18:54.479 --> 00:19:01.409
 sequence of co +2 until scratching and 

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:04.710
 finally we observe that this term 

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:08.879
 here it's alpha and this theme 

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:10.440
 here it's beta and so with the 

00:19:08.879 --> 00:19:13.229
 time alphabets if we are able even 

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:16.529
 to calculate smoothing out of two 

00:19:13.229 --> 00:19:18.899
 hidden variables attached at the same time 

00:19:16.529 --> 00:19:21.869
 and that's actually something that 

00:19:18.899 --> 00:19:25.769
 can be useful among others to make 

00:19:21.869 --> 00:19:28.080
 of learning in some hlm 

00:19:25.769 --> 00:19:29.249
 something that we will have the opportunity to 

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:32.450
 mention when we are going to talk about 

00:19:29.249 --> 00:19:32.450
 automatic language processing
