STEPHANIE HANNON: Hi everyone.

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.240
My name is Stephanie Hannon.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.430
I work on social impact.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.180
Among other things,
we have a lot

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.210
of projects around
civic innovation.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.290
And we are really,
really proud to be

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.760
a partner and collaborator
with Code for America,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.660
and welcome our luminary guest
speaker today, Jenn Pahlka.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.020
She's the founder
of Code for America.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:26.330
She was recently the US Deputy
Chief Technology Officer--

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.190
I worked hard to memorize her
title-- of the United States,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:33.230
and has been pioneering
the use of technology,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.700
entrepreneurs,
coders, visionaries,

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.570
to go work in
government, and tackle

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.310
some of our hardest
civic problems.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:41.730
And she came to tell us today
about the Code for America

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.230
Summit.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.860
It was a really big event
that happened a few weeks ago,

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.620
that brought together more
than 800 people who participate

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.270
in this community, and 130
cities were represented.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.160
It was an epic three-day
event, with lots

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.329
of amazing collaboration.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.870
And she's going to tell us all
about the work going on today.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:57.950
So, welcome Jenn.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.090
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Thank
you so much, Stephanie.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.900
And hello in there.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.220
I'm very excited to be here.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.020
We have a very special
relationship with Google,

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.850
and have had support from Google
from the very beginning of Code

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.190
for America, and continue
to be a beneficiary

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.510
in many, many ways, of this
wonderful organization.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.880
So thank you very much.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.360
I did this Ted Talk a
couple of years ago.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.280
And afterwards an editor of
Wired came up to me and said,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.707
I'm so glad your talk was
good, because I saw that

00:01:30.707 --> 00:01:32.290
on the schedule, and
I thought, that's

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.910
the perfect time for
me to go do meetings.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.420
But apparently, I
had convinced him

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.630
that government was innovative.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.903
I don't think that
those of us who

00:01:42.903 --> 00:01:44.920
know the history of
the technology industry

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.720
should think of this
as such a stretch,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.070
because of course,
things like GPS

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.070
are due to government platforms.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.129
We would not have
the mobile phones

00:01:55.129 --> 00:01:57.170
we have today, the services
that we have that use

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.630
location, if the
government hadn't invested

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.290
in this technology, but more
importantly, opened it up

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.770
to civilian use.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.520
So Tim O'Reilly, who's
here with us today,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.270
has that great line,
that Ronald Reagan

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.210
is the father of Foursquare.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:12.880
Because it was
under him that GPS

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.300
was opened up to civilian use.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.550
And of course, you
guys all know better.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.090
But many people, if you ask them
where they get their weather,

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.750
they believe it comes
from Yahoo or Google.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.390
It comes from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.500
Administration, at great
cost of taxpayer dollars.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.041
And it's served out
through these platforms.

00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.540
This is a great
example of, I think,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.670
government enabling innovation
in the private sector,

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:40.090
for which we don't
give it much credit.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.889
But the reason
people still give me

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:43.680
a hard time about this
notion of government

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.054
innovation, of course, is that
we don't believe that it's

00:02:46.054 --> 00:02:49.000
really in and of itself
innovative today.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.720
And I think that the
three major things

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.920
that folks need to
understand if they're

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.160
going to believe that
government is innovative.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.590
And the first one is
something that, yes,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.460
is a bit of a stretch today,
that interfaces to government--

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.190
digital interfaces
to government--

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.040
can be simple, beautiful,
and easy to use.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.730
We need to believe that
participating in government

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.780
means offering your hands,
not just your voice--

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.900
not just complaining,
but offering to help,

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.485
or being able to help.

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:18.292
You guys can see
me there, I think.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.630
And that the government
can be more--

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.580
not like a tech startup
or a tech company,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:27.038
but more like the
internet itself--

00:03:27.038 --> 00:03:28.980
that solutions can
come from anywhere,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.610
and they can spread very
easily where they need to be.

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.490
So I like to sell,
as an example,

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.490
a story from our second
year of Code for America,

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:40.120
when we had a team of
fellows-- these are developers

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.330
and designers, who
take a year off.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.390
It's their service year.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.950
They're wanting to give
back to their country.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.494
And they went to Honolulu.

00:03:49.494 --> 00:03:51.410
We do this partnership
with local governments,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.160
and we had the
privilege of going

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.950
to the city and
county of Honolulu--

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.100
actually a very large city.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.410
You probably don't realize
it's almost a million people.

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.287
So these three
developers and designers

00:04:02.287 --> 00:04:03.870
were asked to go to
the city, and help

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.203
solve a problem with technology.

00:04:05.203 --> 00:04:07.640
And what they
heard over and over

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.500
was that they wanted them
to fix the city's website.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.870
It was several-- I think it was
tens of thousands of web pages,

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.720
without any CMS backing it.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.660
It was sort of a mess.

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.160
And they said in a
year, the three of us

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.030
are not going to
be able to do this.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.860
Let's find a different
problem that we could solve.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.620
But both the people that
they were talking to,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.530
the residents of Honolulu
and the people in government,

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.410
kept coming back and saying, you
know, this is really a problem.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.140
So they decided to dig
into it and just see

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.050
what the problem was.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.920
So at the time, this is what
Honolulu.gov looked like.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.190
Honolulu.gov is sort of a
classic government website.

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.020
We're starting with government,
the agencies and departments

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.420
that are represented.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.670
The center panel, of
course, is news releases.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.740
It's classic, what
government wants

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.990
to tell you about
what's going on.

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.270
The fellows decided,
let's start with data.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.200
That's probably a much
better place to start.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.140
So they looked at
the search logs.

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.290
And they said, what are
people searching for?

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.040
Turns out the top
search term-- I'm sorry,

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.940
you certainly can't
read this in the slide--

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.769
is driver's licenses.

00:05:10.769 --> 00:05:12.810
Why would you be searching
for driver's licenses?

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.230
Well, A, most people don't
know what level of government

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.729
does what.

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.610
But actually in Honolulu,
the city and county

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.060
does handle the
driver's licenses,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.330
because it's most
of the population.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:24.730
And so they said, OK,
if that's the case,

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.420
let's figure out
how somebody would

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.885
find that information
on this site.

00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:32.990
If you type driver's license
into Honolulu.gov circa 2012,

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.740
you would get a page
that looks like this.

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.490
You would get a page
that looks like this.

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.800
You would get about 20
pages that look like that.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.700
There is a lot of information
about driver's licenses

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:45.170
that we serve up
to our citizens.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.200
And it's things like
that last paragraph that

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.820
explains to you that if
you're a returning service

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.290
member from overseas, you've
got an extra couple of months

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.810
after your driver's
license is expired

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.012
before you need
to get it renewed.

00:05:57.012 --> 00:05:58.720
There's stuff about
the new machines that

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.852
are printing the new
driver's licenses.

00:06:00.852 --> 00:06:02.560
But nowhere on this
site does it actually

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:06.140
tell you how to get
a driver's license.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.170
So the fellows decided that
they could fix this problem.

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.710
And they built-- instead
of fixing the site,

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.960
they decided just to start
fresh with an interface that

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:18.210
is as we like to say, simple,
beautiful, and easy to use.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.320
And they created the
content that they

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.550
thought citizens needed to find.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.035
So if you type "driver's
license" into Honolulu.gov,

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:27.150
you get this.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:28.840
How do you get a new license?

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.297
Where you go-- where you
go, what you need to bring,

00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:33.630
and how you make an appointment.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.900
Boom.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.860
This is what
citizens actually are

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.800
looking for when they're
coming to government websites.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.470
Now that beautiful
interface was directly

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.970
borrowed from our
friends in the UK.

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.470
The Government
Digital Service there

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.100
is doing amazing things
showing to the world

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.620
that this stuff can work
and can work well, not just

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.160
information, but
transactions and services.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:57.722
And so they really
borrowed the technology.

00:06:57.722 --> 00:06:59.430
The Government Digital
Service over there

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.790
was started when
they had-- and this

00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:07.770
may sound familiar-- a $10
billion failure in health IT,

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.930
and decided that there
had to be a better way.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.444
So they hired a
really fantastic guy

00:07:11.444 --> 00:07:13.610
named Mike Bracken, who had
been the head of digital

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:15.300
for "The Guardian" to run it.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:17.050
They gave him the
power and the authority

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:19.580
to actually do the right
thing with technology.

00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.310
And now over there
in the UK, they

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:24.400
are spending about a sixth
of what they were before,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.090
to have more visitors
to their site--

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:28.190
and frankly, much
happier visitors.

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:30.470
They're getting the
information they need.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:32.590
But so back in Honolulu,
you have folks here

00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:35.650
who are creating this
content and putting it

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.850
into a beautiful interface.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.490
But they know that they can't
do all of that work themselves.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.620
They built the content for
only like the top 10 searches,

00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.190
that they saw on the site.

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.520
And then they said, we're going
to have to have a hackathon.

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.600
But they didn't need
any code written.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.050
They needed content written.

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:55.350
So they held a write-a-thon.

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.320
This is the wall on
the co-working space,

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.310
a couple of blocks from
City Hall in Honolulu,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.101
where they wrote out
all the questions that

00:08:01.101 --> 00:08:06.436
were sort of suggested by the
rest of the top search terms.

00:08:06.436 --> 00:08:09.640
You want to pull that over here?

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.280
And they invited a
lot of the people

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.760
that they'd met through
their residency in Honolulu

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.930
where they were going
around and telling

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:16.096
people what they were doing.

00:08:16.096 --> 00:08:18.350
They invited workers
from City Hall.

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.900
And they got together over
the course of a Saturday

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:25.150
in the middle of 2012, and
these people in Honolulu

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.710
got together and wrote the
answers to those questions.

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:28.825
They would share
them back and edit

00:08:28.825 --> 00:08:30.650
them, make sure they
were simple and clear.

00:08:30.650 --> 00:08:33.030
They would run them by the
folks in city government

00:08:33.030 --> 00:08:34.529
to make sure that
they were accurate

00:08:34.529 --> 00:08:37.167
and they put them
into Honolulu Answers.

00:08:37.167 --> 00:08:38.750
And at the end of
the day, pretty much

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:41.000
most of the questions
that citizens need

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.520
answered were in this interface
as a sort of alternative

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:46.210
to Honolulu.gov.

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.390
And more importantly, this
people had a fantastic time.

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.720
At the end of the day, they
were drinking, having fun.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.911
The mayor stopped by
and hung out with them.

00:08:55.911 --> 00:08:57.660
And I think it was
probably the first time

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.450
that I realized that government
technology was actually

00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.500
like a party.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:06.910
And these people not only felt
like they'd enjoyed themselves,

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:10.840
but they now feel
owners of the site.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.360
And they felt like they were
helping their fellow citizens

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:17.460
in a way, using skills that
they had, not just tech skills.

00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:22.140
So that basic interface is
now in about a dozen cities

00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:23.410
around the country.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.660
On National Day of Civic
Hacking two Junes ago,

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.970
Tim and I went to
a co-working space

00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:33.650
a block from Oakland
City Hall, and worked

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.030
on a very similar project.

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.030
Tim did a great answer about
how you take paint to the dump.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.580
Mine was about chickens.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.432
Everyone asks me, isn't
it illegal to keep

00:09:42.432 --> 00:09:43.265
chickens in Oakland?

00:09:43.265 --> 00:09:44.180
No, it's not illegal.

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:45.554
You can keep
chickens in Oakland.

00:09:45.554 --> 00:09:46.920
You just can't have roosters.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:47.753
You don't want them.

00:09:47.753 --> 00:09:49.750
They're very loud.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:53.670
So this is now replicated
all around the country

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.230
by citizens, by the
people, but for the people.

00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:57.879
For the people who
are going to use it.

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.920
This is a screenshot from
our site from ages ago.

00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.430
It's in many more places now.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.290
But those three things I think
are really illustrated here.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:07.950
This notion that
the interfaces can

00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:10.156
be much more beautiful
and easy to use.

00:10:10.156 --> 00:10:12.280
The notion that people
don't just need to complain,

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.530
they can help.

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:15.750
And the fact that these
solutions can spread.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.310
And when you think
of those things,

00:10:17.310 --> 00:10:20.700
I think you start to believe
in our mission statement, which

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.865
is that government can work.

00:10:22.865 --> 00:10:24.990
You can stop there, and
we're pretty controversial.

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.380
We believe that
government can work

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.010
for the people-- for
actual real people--

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:33.160
by the people, helping
out in the 21st century,

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.180
using these solutions.

00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:37.910
But it's not going to
happen, because we complain.

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.350
It's not going to
happen, because we

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:43.386
are frustrated and
yell, and advocate

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:44.760
for government to
do differently.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.780
It's going to happen because
we the people, make it happen.

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:51.550
So I have spent the
past couple of years

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:53.460
just trying to get
people to believe this,

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.410
trying to tell stories that
illustrate what's possible.

00:10:57.410 --> 00:11:01.340
And then last April I was asked
to come serve in the White

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.320
House as the Deputy
Chief Technology Officer.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:06.630
And I got there and start
working on this idea

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.730
that we could replicate what
they had done in the UK,

00:11:09.730 --> 00:11:11.584
with the government
digital service there.

00:11:11.584 --> 00:11:13.500
Brought the best talent
from the tech industry

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.280
to solving these problems,
and doing it right.

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.060
But I was there a couple of
months when this happened.

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:24.109
Healthcare.gov launched,
and then crashed.

00:11:24.109 --> 00:11:26.400
And actually, I think there
were many other people here

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.840
who know a little bit
about this process.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.740
When the site went down,
it was October 1st.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.650
I was out here working on
the previous Code for America

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:36.610
Summit, because the
government was shut down

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:38.750
and I was furloughed.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.050
It was a very
frustrating place to be.

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:43.390
Because this enormous
thing was happening,

00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:47.540
and I was in the center of all
of the people who could fix it.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:49.140
And I wasn't
allowed to even talk

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.010
to my boss for several weeks.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.990
So it felt from the
west coast, kind

00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:58.450
of like this-- just like, oh my
god, somebody fix the problem.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.954
And on the other hand, here
we were, around all the people

00:12:00.954 --> 00:12:03.620
looking for a-- you know, it's a
barn raising, it's a hackathon.

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:05.480
That's how we do things
in Silicon Valley.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.800
Why can't we come out and help?

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.540
Now of course, people
did come out and help.

00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:12.970
Todd Park, my boss, recruited
people primarily from Google

00:12:12.970 --> 00:12:14.090
to come fix the site.

00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:15.590
And we'll talk a bit about that.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.465
But first I want to
answer this question I've

00:12:17.465 --> 00:12:20.920
been asked so many times,
which is why did the site fail?

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.040
Most people believe that--
from outside the tech industry,

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.880
the question I
get most often is,

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.790
how could it have
possibly failed?

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.140
Didn't it have enough money?

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:34.750
It must have been underfunded
and under-planned.

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:36.970
It was absolutely
neither of those things.

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.010
It was over-funded and
it was over-planned.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:41.280
And when I say
"planned," I mean this.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:43.330
And I will not lecture
to a Google crowd

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.460
about the challenges of
waterfall development.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:47.840
But this is de rigueur.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.885
This is standard operating
procedure in government,

00:12:50.885 --> 00:12:53.440
that we do all of the
planning up front.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:55.690
And when we do that--
Clay Shirky had

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:58.100
a great line about
this-- actually he and I

00:12:58.100 --> 00:12:59.370
talked a lot during the year.

00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:01.940
And he wrote up an article
in "Foreign Affairs" where

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:05.300
he explained that the waterfall
method amounts by a pledge,

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.650
to a pledge by all parties,
not to learn anything

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.670
while doing the actual work.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.970
Waterfall method is
what we do in DC,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.400
not just because it's
what's comfortable there,

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.450
but because we have a
culture of legislation.

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:25.600
It's sort of as if you wrote
the rules around search quality

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.700
or spam control once--
when Google started,

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.510
and it was written
into legislation.

00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:33.540
In order to change how you
interact with your users,

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.180
you had to go to Congress.

00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.900
It's a very fundamental,
difficult problem.

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.442
But it is rooted not just in
the fact that we run the country

00:13:42.442 --> 00:13:44.400
through legislation, but
through a culture that

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.270
assumes the things
get written once,

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.170
and then don't get changed.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.150
So we do all of our
planning, and then we

00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:52.390
execute to that plan,
whether it's working or not.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.530
And it certainly
was not working.

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:58.780
The other reason that we
do government technology

00:13:58.780 --> 00:14:01.000
through waterfall
development methodology,

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.110
is that we have this thing
called the Federal Acquisition

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:04.900
Regulation.

00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.440
It is something like
2,600 pages long.

00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.380
And it's the regulation
that tells us

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.740
how we buy things in
federal government.

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:16.370
Well, that unfortunately also
means how we buy technology.

00:14:16.370 --> 00:14:19.070
And it says a lot
of things in there

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.630
about-- if you think about
it, if you were a buyer,

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.552
you want to know what you were
buying before you bought it.

00:14:24.552 --> 00:14:26.260
So that has been
interpreted as, well, we

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.400
must know everything
the software is going

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:31.930
to do before we have any
interaction with a vendor--

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:36.620
which of course is going to
lead to that kind of problem.

00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:39.280
Problems like this and
others have contributed

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:46.796
to what many think is about a
94% failure rate in federal IT.

00:14:46.796 --> 00:14:48.420
I know that sounds
like a crazy number.

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.860
I think it's actually true.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.930
If you looked at
the number of things

00:14:51.930 --> 00:14:54.200
that did work, but
actually cost so much

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.680
more than any confident
technologist would think

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.630
it should cost, they're
probably all failures,

00:15:00.630 --> 00:15:01.762
I think in some way.

00:15:01.762 --> 00:15:04.345
And the ones that are successes
run very much under the radar.

00:15:04.345 --> 00:15:06.261
They just simply don't
go through the process.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.160
But I think the more fundamental
point about the failure

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.390
of government IT
is this, yes, we

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.630
are upset when our taxpayer
dollars aren't spent well.

00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:22.610
Especially when we know it
could be done so much better.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.890
But there is a deep anxiety that
our society exhibits when we

00:15:26.890 --> 00:15:29.830
realize that we cannot
actually govern,

00:15:29.830 --> 00:15:33.410
if we can't implement the
policies that we create.

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.680
And if you think about the years
leading up to Healthcare.gov,

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.790
the passage of the
Affordable Care Act,

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.930
and all of the political will
that went into passing that--

00:15:42.930 --> 00:15:46.160
and then to think that
it almost went away--

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.110
we actually almost
lost that policy,

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:52.600
because we could not put
up a website that works.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.400
Then you really see
that our inattention

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.380
to the federal
government landscape,

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:01.610
is threatening our ability to
have a functioning democracy.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:03.960
Have I sacred you enough yet?

00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:04.710
Are you terrified?

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.870
AUDIENCE: It's not a surprise.

00:16:05.870 --> 00:16:06.570
JENNIFER PAHLKA: You should be.

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.740
Yes, its not a surprise.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:10.460
But it is something we
have to come around to.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.570
So when Healthcare.gov
failed, and I

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.860
was on the other side of the
country sort of freaking out,

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.150
I remembered this blog post
the Tom Steinberg had written

00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:23.290
a year or two earlier,
about a colleague of his

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.090
who was an absolute genius.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:26.150
The guy was at Poly Math.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:28.483
He could have done anything
in the world that he wanted.

00:16:28.483 --> 00:16:31.330
But he had dedicated his
life to civic technology.

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.640
And sadly Chris
Lightfoot had died,

00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:37.590
and five years later,
Tom was memorializing him

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:40.720
with this blog post, where
he talks about this--

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.750
why Chris dedicated
his life this way.

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.280
And he said, what Chris
fundamentally had right,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.910
was the understanding
that you can no longer run

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:52.070
a country properly, if the
elites don't understand

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.320
technology in the same way
that they grasp economics

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.489
or ideology, or propaganda.

00:16:57.489 --> 00:16:59.530
And if you think about
when you were growing up--

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:01.415
and I don't know--
whatever age you are,

00:17:01.415 --> 00:17:03.790
who were the people who were
going to go into government?

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.720
Lawyers, economists--
digital people

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.390
didn't go into government.

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:09.869
Now that's going
to have to change.

00:17:09.869 --> 00:17:12.569
And he says, Chris'
analysis and predictions

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.359
about what would happen if
the elites couldn't learn

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:19.510
were savage and
depressingly accurate.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:20.990
And I think that
what he's saying

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:23.869
is that he was predicting
Healthcare.gov,

00:17:23.869 --> 00:17:26.060
here and in Britain.

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:28.755
And that there is something
truly scary about a country

00:17:28.755 --> 00:17:30.380
that cannot implement
its own policies.

00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.400
Savage and
depressingly accurate.

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:39.480
Yes, but the story got
better, as you all know.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.497
This is what it
Mikey Dick-- I took

00:17:41.497 --> 00:17:42.830
this slide from Mikey Dickerson.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:46.250
I hope many of you know, but
Healthcare.gov is slightly less

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.720
terrible today.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:49.630
Best headline ever.

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:53.640
That was a couple months in,
and then of course by April,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.450
Obamacare had enrolled over 8
million people, which is more

00:17:57.450 --> 00:18:00.650
than we even thought would
be enrolled in the program

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:05.980
before the site failed,
an absolute miracle.

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.160
How did they do that?

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.310
They did the opposite of
what we've done before.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.940
They said that the
geeks must come,

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.520
and they must be in charge.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.570
They brought tech
talent to government.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.706
That's my Mikey there,
who-- I'm sure many of you

00:18:18.706 --> 00:18:21.010
know Jeannie Kim,
also a former Googler.

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:23.350
[INAUDIBLE] my colleague
in the White House.

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:26.590
And Todd Park,
hiding behind there.

00:18:26.590 --> 00:18:28.450
They came to government
and they said,

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.550
we are going to
take this seriously.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:36.192
We, the people must come,
and we can do better.

00:18:36.192 --> 00:18:38.740
The thing that you should know,
in case you haven't heard it.

00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:40.170
And maybe can you
raise your hand

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:42.880
if you've heard
Mikey speak before?

00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.170
OK, not everybody has.

00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.000
The thing you should know
about that team, Googlers

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.500
and non-Googlers, is that it was
like they were fighting a war.

00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.590
I saw Paul Smith a couple weeks
in, and asked about his family.

00:18:59.590 --> 00:19:02.490
And he couldn't answer me.

00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:05.240
He said, please don't talk to
me about anything personal right

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:05.770
now.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:09.210
Because he had been
working for 20 hours a day,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:10.760
for about 100 days.

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.220
Mikey did the same thing.

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:15.390
And when you do that,
you become exhausted.

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:18.040
And they did this for a reason.

00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.070
They did this because they
knew that people in the country

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:22.390
needed health care.

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.790
And that they weren't going
to get it if the site failed.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:28.680
I think that they are
true American heroes.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:31.320
I think everybody who
came to solve this problem

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.267
really deserves not
just our admiration,

00:19:33.267 --> 00:19:34.225
but are true gratitude.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.820
How did they actually
do it though?

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:43.145
Because it was as we
say, a giant cluster.

00:19:43.145 --> 00:19:44.520
I mentioned all
the planning that

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.682
happens in a waterfall process.

00:19:46.682 --> 00:19:47.890
They just threw the plan out.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:49.640
And they started
listening to the users.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.790
They were absolutely
laser-focused on what the user

00:19:53.790 --> 00:19:57.190
experience was, and just
making the site a little bit

00:19:57.190 --> 00:19:59.600
better every day, based on
what they could actually

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.920
see people trying to do.

00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:06.980
The other moment that I
really remember so well

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.160
from that year, was coming into
the office very late at night.

00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.220
And Ryan [INAUDIBLE]
was there-- one

00:20:12.220 --> 00:20:14.410
of the people who was
working with Mikey.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:18.290
And we were talking
about-- we were talking

00:20:18.290 --> 00:20:20.080
about the people who
need health care.

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.840
And he explained to me that at
about 3 o'clock in the morning

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.460
every night, the
site-- Healthcare.gov

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.340
was getting an enormous
amount of traffic

00:20:27.340 --> 00:20:30.970
from very low-end smartphones.

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:33.200
Because the people
who need health care

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.610
often don't have
access to the internet.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.100
And they don't have nice
iPhones and Android phones.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.320
And they have multiple jobs.

00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.310
And they knew-- they
were smart enough

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:46.010
to know that the load would be
lighter at 3:00 in the morning.

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.400
So they would get up in
the middle of the night,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.490
and try to make it
through Healthcare.gov

00:20:50.490 --> 00:20:52.440
on a low-end smartphone.

00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:55.880
And they would get a little
bit further each time.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.180
And that's how we got
to that eight million.

00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.475
Just think about who goes
on a site like that at 3:00

00:21:01.475 --> 00:21:02.100
in the morning.

00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.600
It'll give you a sense of the
people that they were helping.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.520
The other way they did it, was
to get a little bit as we say,

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.310
sharp elbows.

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:13.880
Mikey, famously, threatened
to punch people in the face,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.570
in order to get basic
monitoring on the site.

00:21:17.570 --> 00:21:21.610
He didn't actually punch
anyone's face, that was great.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:24.600
But the experience that
that team had really

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:25.460
resonated with me.

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.780
Because I had just
left Code for America.

00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.780
We were starting to work
on these very same issues.

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.470
And Ezra Klein put it really
beautifully in an article

00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:37.160
about Healthcare.gov,
when he said

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:42.350
that too often the press and
the general public, of course,

00:21:42.350 --> 00:21:45.019
really doesn't even know
the pain and the trouble

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:46.810
of interfacing with
government bureaucracy,

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:49.540
that the poor struggle
with every day.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.890
So when Mikey and
Ryan were talking

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.390
about those people going on the
site at 3:00 in the morning,

00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:56.290
it reminded me of the
work that I had just

00:21:56.290 --> 00:21:59.300
been exposed to through
our team in San Francisco.

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.020
Watch this animation.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:04.350
This is just part of the process
that you will go through,

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.752
if you try to apply for food
stamps in San Francisco.

00:22:06.752 --> 00:22:08.210
I'm going to do
that again for you,

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:09.626
because it's so
much fun to watch.

00:22:14.170 --> 00:22:16.340
It's a lot of information
that we collect.

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:19.330
And did you see this,
here at the end?

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:20.970
It's over 50
screens, just a site.

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:22.330
And you know what you
do at the end of that?

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:23.621
Can you see that middle button?

00:22:23.621 --> 00:22:24.530
It says print.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:25.080
You're going to print it.

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:25.880
And you're gonna fax it in.

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:27.171
And you're going to take it in.

00:22:27.171 --> 00:22:29.420
And that's just going
to get re-entered.

00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.230
This is how you apply
for food assistance

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:32.750
in the state of California.

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:34.500
And we found out about
this through a team

00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.458
who was working with the
city and county of San

00:22:36.458 --> 00:22:39.500
Francisco on this problem
of Churn in food stamps.

00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:41.610
So once you do all
of that, and then

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:45.160
a bunch of other interviews, a
bunch of other proof of income

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.282
and things like that.

00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:47.740
You become enrolled
in the program,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.090
and what happens then is you
almost immediately fall off

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:51.740
the roles.

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.750
Almost everybody who applies
then is off the rolls

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.860
pretty quickly there after.

00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:59.290
Which results in the
following, people

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:03.330
will be at the front of the
line at the checkout counter

00:23:03.330 --> 00:23:05.713
with their EBT card, electronic
benefit transfer-- what

00:23:05.713 --> 00:23:08.390
we used to call food
stamps, it's now a card.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:10.390
They will have all of
their groceries packed up,

00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:12.540
and they're ready to go.

00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:14.832
They slide their card,
and it doesn't work.

00:23:14.832 --> 00:23:17.040
Very often, this again is
in the middle of the night.

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.164
It's happening at midnight.

00:23:18.164 --> 00:23:21.490
Because that's when you think
your card has been recharged.

00:23:21.490 --> 00:23:23.440
Who goes shopping at midnight?

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.690
Hungry people go
shopping at midnight.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:28.100
And they don't even know that
their cards doesn't work.

00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.900
And the reason why, is because
they've gotten several notices

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:33.600
in the mail that look like this.

00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.100
This actually one
of the nicer ones.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:35.950
And I'm going to read it to you.

00:23:35.950 --> 00:23:37.652
Because I feel like
torturing you today.

00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:39.360
"Your food stamp
benefits in this quarter

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:41.655
did not change, as a result
of the document/information

00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:43.030
we received,
because it would not

00:23:43.030 --> 00:23:45.064
have resulted in an
increase in benefits."

00:23:45.064 --> 00:23:46.730
Your food stamp
benefits in this quarter

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:49.313
do not change as a result of the
document or information we've

00:23:49.313 --> 00:23:51.710
received, because-- it goes
on like this for pages.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.610
And somehow from this,
you were supposed

00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.370
to determine-- know that
you need to call the office

00:23:56.370 --> 00:23:58.800
and provide some more
of that documentation.

00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:00.450
I don't get that
from this language,

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:01.960
and neither does anybody else.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.320
But this is how we
communicate with people

00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:07.990
who need food
assistance in our state.

00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:10.450
And so when you get that,
you don't do anything.

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:12.190
Once you're on
the program again,

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:13.981
you need to find out
where you can actually

00:24:13.981 --> 00:24:15.100
spend your benefits.

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.100
And this is one of the
interfaces you go through

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:20.127
to try to find somewhere
that will take your card.

00:24:20.127 --> 00:24:21.710
It's not the worst
thing in the world.

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:22.950
But it's not the most
beautiful thing either.

00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:24.366
And of course,
it's browser-based.

00:24:24.366 --> 00:24:26.530
So you're probably doing
this on a smartphone.

[DIAL TONES]

00:24:37.657 --> 00:24:39.740
JENNIFER PAHLKA: I think
I've tortured you enough.

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:40.400
I'll move on.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.810
You don't have to listen
to the whole thing.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:45.612
So these are small things.

00:24:45.612 --> 00:24:47.570
I'm borrowing this from
wonderful Jake Solomon,

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:48.395
who worked on this.

00:24:48.395 --> 00:24:51.470
These don't seem like
that big of a deal.

00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:56.420
But especially if you're
poor, they really add up.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.060
There are 3 and
1/2 million people

00:24:58.060 --> 00:25:00.890
who are eligible for CalFresh,
our state's Nutrition

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:03.070
Assistance program,
but not getting it

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:08.010
because it's really difficult
to get on the program.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:10.300
The welfare recipients are
paying about $20 million

00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:12.456
a year, just in the
state of California

00:25:12.456 --> 00:25:14.330
in ATM fees, which goes
straight to the bank.

00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:17.450
So if you're on food assistance,
and you're paying $3.50 to use

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:19.180
it.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:21.470
Most importantly,
when you do have

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.690
that-- you need to call the
office to stay on the program,

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:26.956
you are often on
hold for hours--

00:25:26.956 --> 00:25:29.080
you know, for at least half
an hour, often an hour,

00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.687
before you can even
talk to somebody.

00:25:31.687 --> 00:25:33.395
And it's not just the
digital interfaces.

00:25:33.395 --> 00:25:35.600
This is somebody
applying for the program.

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.740
They're using a pencil
that's too small,

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.250
on a wall that isn't flat.

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:43.020
It's just indicative over and
over again of the experience

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:44.510
that we put people through.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.560
These are the bathrooms
in the Human Services

00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:48.630
Agency in San Francisco.

00:25:48.630 --> 00:25:52.470
It's a full experience
that's not very pleasant.

00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:54.990
The good news is, this is
the Code for America team

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:57.610
that's working on this problem.

00:25:57.610 --> 00:26:02.580
The guy in the glasses, in front
of the women in the blue shirt,

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.090
is the person who led
the challenge in 2012,

00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:09.280
to fix this problem of Churn
in the food stamps program.

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:14.370
Others are Fellows that have
come to the program in 2014

00:26:14.370 --> 00:26:16.910
along the bottom row, who are
working on super-utilizers

00:26:16.910 --> 00:26:20.277
in the ER, in Long
Beach, California.

00:26:20.277 --> 00:26:22.110
And others, who just
sort have come together

00:26:22.110 --> 00:26:23.485
to work on some
of these problems

00:26:23.485 --> 00:26:26.360
that I'm going to show you.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:26.860
Sorry.

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:31.284
The super-utilizer is
people who need health care.

00:26:31.284 --> 00:26:32.450
They don't have health care.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.325
And so they go to the
ER over and over again.

00:26:34.325 --> 00:26:36.930
They're there for
very basic care.

00:26:36.930 --> 00:26:40.406
And if you give them the
services that they need,

00:26:40.406 --> 00:26:41.780
which often aren't
health, right?

00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.450
Often they are basic,
social services.

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:47.430
It's not that hard to keep them
from returning from the ER,

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:51.190
but what we generally do is
just let them come to the ER.

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:57.340
There are people who go to the
ER 100 to 150 times a year.

00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:00.060
It's very high cost,
obviously to the system.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:02.409
And very high cost
to the individual.

00:27:02.409 --> 00:27:03.950
So I'm gonna show
you a couple things

00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:05.366
that this team's
been trying to do

00:27:05.366 --> 00:27:08.010
over the past year and a half.

00:27:08.010 --> 00:27:11.440
This is that notice
that we talked about.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.830
What Jake found to do through
many different efforts

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:19.350
on this Churn problem--
not the first thing,

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.330
but eventually what
he landed on to do,

00:27:22.330 --> 00:27:25.870
was a very basic text
message that these folks get.

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.716
They still get those
terrible notices.

00:27:27.716 --> 00:27:29.590
But when they're about
to fall off the roles,

00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.960
they now get a text message that
says your CalFresh benefits may

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.210
stop at the end of this month.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.550
If you have questions, call us.

00:27:36.550 --> 00:27:40.120
So the people who were enrolled
in this program, 40% fewer

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.990
fell off the rolls
because of Promptly.

00:27:43.990 --> 00:27:45.482
And when they don't
fall off, they

00:27:45.482 --> 00:27:47.690
don't have to go through
that incredibly long process

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:49.700
of reapplying.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.000
This is Alan Williams.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.970
He was a fellow with us in 2013,
working on something completely

00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:59.340
different-- on essentially
a GTFS, for trails,

00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:01.230
an open trails
standard specification.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.260
But he became excited
about the work

00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.330
that his team was
doing on food stamps,

00:28:05.330 --> 00:28:07.270
and so when the
fellowship ended,

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:09.710
he decided to not
take any income,

00:28:09.710 --> 00:28:11.290
and enroll in all
the social services

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:13.420
that he could apply for.

00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:15.960
So he spends a lot
of time on the phone,

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:17.110
trying to get his services.

00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.580
OPERATOR: (VOICEOVER)At
this time,

00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.730

helping callers.

00:28:19.730 --> 00:28:21.840
So please continue to
hold, and your call

00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.694
will be answered by our
next available operator.

00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:30.398

[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:28:31.306 --> 00:28:34.280
JENNIFER PAHLKA: So he
spends a lot of time on hold.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.150
But he understands
the experience

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:38.884
that people in the
system are getting.

00:28:38.884 --> 00:28:41.383
So the first thing that he did
is, remember that-- actually,

00:28:41.383 --> 00:28:43.730
let me back up here.

00:28:43.730 --> 00:28:46.149
Oh, it doesn't look
like I did the new deck.

00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:47.690
The first thing that
he did is worked

00:28:47.690 --> 00:28:49.710
on a what we call,
Clean, which is

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:53.220
a five-screen application
for food stamps,

00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:56.270
instead of a fifty-screen
that works really well

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:58.240
on a basic smartphone.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.370
Boom.

00:28:59.370 --> 00:29:02.850
So compare that to
what you saw before.

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:04.590
And you don't have
to print it, exactly.

00:29:04.590 --> 00:29:05.600
Though when they get
it in the office,

00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.260
they still print it, which is
something we're working on.

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:10.270
This is a very simple
way of figuring out

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.490
where you can spend
your EBT cards.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:18.520
This is a very simple way that
you can find out the balance.

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:21.580
You just simply text
in your EBT card.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.709
We have a very funky thing
going on in the back end

00:29:23.709 --> 00:29:24.750
to figure out what it is.

00:29:24.750 --> 00:29:26.083
And then we text it back to you.

00:29:26.083 --> 00:29:27.667
Boom.

00:29:27.667 --> 00:29:30.250
And connect in such a way that
you don't have to wait on hold.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:34.035
So you text in, you text
in your phone number

00:29:34.035 --> 00:29:36.250
to CalFresh to connect,
and it tells you,

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.180
great, I'm going
to call the HSA,

00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.300
the Human Services
Agency, for you.

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:43.320
And when there's someone
who can speak to you,

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.880
it calls you back.

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:47.820
Now if you don't have unlimited
minutes on your phone,

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:50.515
as most of those people
don't, this is a big deal.

00:29:50.515 --> 00:29:52.140
And when you're trying
to work two jobs

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.306
and get your kids to school,
it's a really big deal.

00:29:54.306 --> 00:29:55.695
The thing that I
love about this,

00:29:55.695 --> 00:29:58.300
is this did not happen through
the Human Services Agency

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.340
in San Francisco.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:00.340
The guys just did this.

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.974
They're We sort of pulled
back into the fold.

00:30:02.974 --> 00:30:04.390
But they were
literally just doing

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:07.490
this in sort of an
activist capacity.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:12.290
But when Jake, who had worked
on this Churn problem with HSA,

00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:14.870
told Leo O'Farrell,
the head of HSA

00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:18.580
in San Francisco about
this Connect product,

00:30:18.580 --> 00:30:20.640
Leo said, that's fantastic.

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:22.430
One requirement though.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:25.640
It has to be my voice
on the line that

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.840
tells the social services
worker to hold the line.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:30.880
Or else they will hang up.

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.440
He insisted on saying,
this is Leo O'Farrell.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.960
I have a client for
you on the line.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.970
Please hold.

00:30:37.970 --> 00:30:40.900
When we think that people
in government don't care,

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:41.561
were wrong.

00:30:41.561 --> 00:30:42.060
They do.

00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.230
They just need help.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.400
When you give it to them,
they want to engage.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.900
They're really an
amazing group of people.

00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:51.100
So these little things,
I think are adding up,

00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.705
to something of a better
experience for people

00:30:53.705 --> 00:30:57.300
who have to deal with
government technology.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.680
I think in California now, we're
making a bit of a difference.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.280
But we are really still
nibbling at the edges

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.800
of an enormous problem.

00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.210
Government IT in this--
this is an old stat.

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.750
I think it's about $180
billion dollars that we're

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:13.870
spending on government
IT right now.

00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:15.570
And the results
speak for themselves.

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:18.480
They're just simply not--
we're not getting anywhere

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:21.610
near $180 billion of value.

00:31:21.610 --> 00:31:25.030
Of course the good news-- the
United States Digital Service,

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:28.600
the unit of the executive
office president,

00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.410
that I went to DC to set
up, is up and running.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.180
And Mikey Dickerson
is leading it.

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:36.400
I can't think of a better
person to do this work.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.970
He'll threaten to punch people.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.440
And he cares about
the American public.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.435
They're doing amazing work.

00:31:42.435 --> 00:31:44.560
We also publish this United
States Digital Services

00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.400
Playbook, that explains
to folks in government

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.230
how you can get better
results, for much less money.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.530
I spent most of the
time that I was there

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:54.320
on number four, a
billed services that

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.760
use agile and
iterative practices.

00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:01.400
Because the Office of
Federal Procurement Policy,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:05.020
that manages Federal
Acquisition Regulation,

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.800
needed to understand that
this is actually legal.

00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.110
And so in conjunction with
the Digital Services Playbook,

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:13.550
we also published something
called the TechFAR Handbook,

00:32:13.550 --> 00:32:15.640
that tells contacting
officers and others who

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:18.120
work in the field
of procurement,

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:22.460
why this is legal, how to do
it, and make sure they're very

00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.722
clear that at the
end of the day,

00:32:25.722 --> 00:32:27.930
the authority on procurement
is the Office of Federal

00:32:27.930 --> 00:32:29.100
Procurement Policy.

00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:32.210
And when they put this
out that literally says,

00:32:32.210 --> 00:32:34.720
we are helping you
build digital services

00:32:34.720 --> 00:32:37.460
with a particular focus on how
to use contractors to support

00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:39.890
an iterative customer-driven
software development

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:43.660
process, as is routinely done
in the private sector, that's

00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:44.466
change.

00:32:44.466 --> 00:32:45.840
It's going to take
us a long time

00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:47.587
to see the results
of that change.

00:32:47.587 --> 00:32:49.170
But that's fundamental
change that you

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:50.270
should be excited about.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:57.030
I do want to question the
notion that this is innovation.

00:32:57.030 --> 00:32:58.810
I think this is the basics.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:01.170
Government should be able to
ship a website that works.

00:33:01.170 --> 00:33:04.000
And we should not wrap it
in the banner of innovation.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.380
It sort of degrades the notion
of innovation in my book.

00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.960
But I do want to
return to this idea

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.250
that government can innovate.

00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.458
And I think that the most
innovation that's happening

00:33:12.458 --> 00:33:16.860
isn't in this sort of battle
between the west coast tech

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:19.920
wizards and the east coast
protectors of the way

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.070
it used to be.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.530
But all around the country.

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:27.090
This is of map of the
brigades in the United States.

00:33:27.090 --> 00:33:29.140
A Code for America
brigade is a group

00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:32.260
of volunteers who meet
generally on a Tuesday

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.330
night in City Hall.

00:33:34.330 --> 00:33:36.290
They are developers,
they're designers,

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.470
they're just random
citizens who can write,

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.520
whatever-- who work
with their cities

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:45.050
to make technology better,
and make the citizen

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.060
experience better.

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.720
So they do things like
open data portals,

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.760
and help with open
data policies.

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:51.760
They will stand up apps.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:53.550
They can implement
any of the things

00:33:53.550 --> 00:33:55.180
that I just showed,
for people who

00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:57.505
use food assistance
in their city.

00:33:57.505 --> 00:33:59.450
It's very easily redeployable.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.040
They're doing a
wide range of things

00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.980
that the city
themselves can't do.

00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:06.320
So not only are they
helping the city,

00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.730
helping the citizens
of the city,

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.520
but the real impact
that they have

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.840
is that the people in government
see this, and go, wow, maybe

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:15.303
we could do better.

00:34:15.303 --> 00:34:17.469
There's innovation happening
all around the country.

00:34:17.469 --> 00:34:21.370
This is an example of a project
that the Code for America

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:24.940
Fellows worked on in Charlotte,
North Carolina this year.

00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:26.850
It's a very quick video.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:29.857
But I think of it as
somewhat innovative in a way

00:34:29.857 --> 00:34:31.690
that I kind of think
about Google right now.

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:34.199
I'm sure there's many, many
more innovative things happening

00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:34.698
at Google.

00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:37.170
But I love that
my phone tells me

00:34:37.170 --> 00:34:39.820
when I'm supposed to leave
for an appointment now.

00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.650
I didn't ask it to.

00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:42.100
It just started doing that.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:46.060
But that notion of let's
get information to a person

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:51.090
exactly when they need it is
sort of innovative these days.

00:34:51.090 --> 00:34:53.257
And so the folks in
Charlotte asked our team

00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:55.465
to build something that
looks a little bit like-- oh,

00:34:55.465 --> 00:34:56.340
I have to click this.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:57.160
Sorry about that.

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.495
You select the kind of thing
you want notifications about,

00:35:00.495 --> 00:35:04.040
and then in the next screen, it
gives you a map of your city.

00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:09.560
And you can custom draw whatever
geography is relevant to you.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.730
So you may want to know
about special events

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:13.340
across the whole city.

00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:16.560
You may want to know
about new businesses just

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.117
on the three blocks
right where you live.

00:35:19.117 --> 00:35:19.950
It lets you do that.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:21.700
And then asks for your
cellphone or email,

00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.760
and it texts you or
emails you when there's

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.510
a traffic incident, or a
water service, or whatever,

00:35:26.510 --> 00:35:28.890
just in the area that
you've written about,

00:35:28.890 --> 00:35:29.885
that you've defined.

00:35:32.405 --> 00:35:34.030
Here's a great thing--
and I'm actually

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.830
going to try to go over
and demo it for you.

00:35:36.830 --> 00:35:38.730
A bunch of Fellows
this year decided

00:35:38.730 --> 00:35:45.610
that we need to have a much more
broad dialogue about transit,

00:35:45.610 --> 00:35:47.659
especially here
in San Francisco.

00:35:47.659 --> 00:35:49.950
And they built something that
really looks like a tool.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:52.370
I'm gonna demonstrate it
for you really quickly.

00:35:52.370 --> 00:35:53.530
You can load up any city.

00:35:53.530 --> 00:35:55.000
I'll use San Francisco here.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.410
But just hit start.

00:35:57.410 --> 00:36:01.087
And you can draw any
transit line you want.

00:36:01.087 --> 00:36:02.920
So you're going to put
in your transit line.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.830
I zoomed out.

00:36:03.830 --> 00:36:06.070
So this is a very short line.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:09.360
And it'll tell you how much
it costs per year-- sorry,

00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.590
now I've got to stop.

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:13.480
And basically people
all over the country

00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.555
have been using this.

00:36:15.555 --> 00:36:18.380
Let me see if I have-- oh,
I didn't put in an example.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.010
They're making transit maps
the way they want them to be,

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:21.970
all over the country.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:23.200
And in fact, they're
competitive about it.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:25.210
In Seattle, is in these
people's are competing

00:36:25.210 --> 00:36:28.100
to do better transit map you
could just load the current map

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:31.620
and then add it or you can
start with your own lines.

00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:33.920
But it's something that
really, when it came out,

00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.150
these sort of urbanist
publications picked it up.

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.000
And they talked about
it as a toy or a game.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.590
And it is, it's really fun to
play-- not that I showed that

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.140
very well.

00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:44.284
But what we found is
that actually, especially

00:36:44.284 --> 00:36:46.200
in small cities around
the country-- remember,

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.720
there are 30,000 municipalities
in this country--

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.790
it has become, in just a few
short months, the tool they

00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:53.300
are using.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.140
The enterprise tool that
small cities are using.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:36:59.930
It's displacing--
it's just displacing,

00:36:59.930 --> 00:37:04.430
really in many cases, these
enormous spreadsheets that

00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.510
grow up over time.

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:09.260
But also these enterprise tools.

00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.220
So I do see signs of true
innovation in government.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.250
There's many, many more.

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.791
I'm not going to go
into all of them,

00:37:14.791 --> 00:37:16.300
with the time that we have.

00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:18.210
But I will return
to this notion,

00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:20.050
that it's not just
about this idea

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:23.790
of for the people from
the "Gettysburg Address."

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:27.550
But it really is, when you look
at people like Mikey and Jake,

00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:28.400
who are doing this.

00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:29.960
They're doing it
because government

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:33.980
can work for people--
real people who

00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.877
need to interact with
government, and not

00:37:35.877 --> 00:37:36.460
just the poor.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:38.084
We all have to interact
with government

00:37:38.084 --> 00:37:39.360
at some point in our lives.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:41.590
And when you think
about the people,

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.060
it becomes much more real.

00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:47.800
And of course, by actual real
people who are doing this work.

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.230
The other way that
I really stress

00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.340
we must think about this,
is without that middle.

00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:57.260
Government can work
if we make it so.

00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:00.280
It's only going to happen, if
we come together and actually do

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.720
it, which is why I will
and on an ask to you.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:06.420
We are just a
couple of years old.

00:38:06.420 --> 00:38:08.325
We've gotten amazing
support for the work

00:38:08.325 --> 00:38:09.330
that we've done so far.

00:38:09.330 --> 00:38:14.450
But there is so incredibly
much more that we need to do.

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:16.400
The first thing I would
ask Googlers to do

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.910
is to-- and excuse me,
because I know that recruiting

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.550
is difficult all
over the Valley,

00:38:21.550 --> 00:38:24.155
and all over the tech
industry-- but take a year off

00:38:24.155 --> 00:38:26.086
and do this with us.

00:38:26.086 --> 00:38:27.710
Our Code for America
Fellowship program

00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:28.835
is a year out of your life.

00:38:28.835 --> 00:38:31.160
We've had I think four
Googlers do it so far.

00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.720
We'd like to have 40 more do it.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.040
We'd like to have
400 more do it.

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.670
It's an amazing experience.

00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:38.740
You will learn and
do, and see things

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.710
that you would never
thought you would do.

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.320
[INAUDIBLE], who did
it two years ago,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.700
ended up learning a lot about
the criminal justice system.

00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:50.450
And that's something I
could do a whole talk on.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:52.170
It's a fantastic experience.

00:38:52.170 --> 00:38:54.940
And our 2015 class
is already set.

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:56.780
So the next opportunity
would for you

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.912
to apply in the middle
of 2015 for 2016.

00:38:59.912 --> 00:39:01.620
But I would love to
talk to you about it,

00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:04.950
if it's something you'd
be interested in doing.

00:39:04.950 --> 00:39:08.040
We're able to do our work
because the tech industry has

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:09.450
done very well for itself.

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:11.920
And we hope that people
will consider donating,

00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:13.490
so that we can do
more of this work

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:15.690
for the people who need it.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.640
It's not the only way that
you can get involved though.

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:22.280
We recently-- well, we did not
launch-- Ron Bouganim recently

00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:26.430
launched the first
ever Govtech fund.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.520
It's a venture fund just for
companies that are actually

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.160
going to disrupt in a good
way, the civic ecosystem,

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.862
or government
technology ecosystem.

00:39:35.862 --> 00:39:37.320
So I would encourage
any of you who

00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:39.150
are thinking about
doing businesses,

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:42.740
to look at that
$180 billion market.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.500
A lot of that is going to
change over the coming years.

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.220
And the companies that are going
in there to offer services,

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.350
that look like the kind
of work that you do here,

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.754
are going to be
extremely successful.

00:39:53.754 --> 00:39:55.170
There's also
obviously opportunity

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:57.370
to invest in
companies like that.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.410
And then there's a million
sort of casual ways

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.830
that you can help.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:04.240
On our site right now, you
can find our civic tech issue

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:04.750
finder.

00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:08.800
So if you wanted to go, say,
take an hour tonight and code

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:13.067
on a project that has an open
issue across our network--

00:40:13.067 --> 00:40:15.150
which includes not just
Code for America projects,

00:40:15.150 --> 00:40:16.650
but across the civic
tech ecosystem.

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:20.410
So Sunlight Foundation
has projects on there.

00:40:20.410 --> 00:40:21.910
You can pretty
easily find something

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:22.993
that might need your help.

00:40:22.993 --> 00:40:25.970
Do a little help, and
feel good about yourself.

00:40:25.970 --> 00:40:28.260
But to me-- and whatever
you do, the point is,

00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:31.960
we are all told every day that
we are primarily consumers,

00:40:31.960 --> 00:40:34.120
that our job is to buy things.

00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:36.110
But we really have to
live like citizens.

00:40:36.110 --> 00:40:38.110
And understanding that
your government needs you

00:40:38.110 --> 00:40:40.300
is part of that.

00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.438
Thank you very
much for having me.

00:40:42.438 --> 00:40:46.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:49.470
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:53.900
So a couple questions--
one is maybe could you

00:40:53.900 --> 00:40:57.490
go to the like-- so
first of all, the story,

00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:00.300
the Mikey Dickinson story
is pretty inspiring.

00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.280
But it's also reflects
a pretty extreme level

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:07.270
of personal sacrifice--
I presume most people who

00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.300
are applying this
thing, probably

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.410
wouldn't be committing
to that level.

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:13.660
So maybe you can
talk about like,

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:16.852
what sort of things
you're looking for?

00:41:16.852 --> 00:41:17.810
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Mm hm.

00:41:17.810 --> 00:41:20.510
AUDIENCE: And the second
is, what's the process?

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:22.720
I mean, I went to his
previous tech talk,

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.670
and it was like, well, if you're
interested, send us an email.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:29.320
And I think for people on the
fence, that's probably not

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.167
really enough.

00:41:30.167 --> 00:41:32.250
You kind of want to know
what you're getting into,

00:41:32.250 --> 00:41:34.700
before taking a step
like that, and saying,

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:35.930
I'm going to do this.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:37.280
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Right.

00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:39.560
Sure, so yeah.

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:42.220
No, most people don't--
aren't working on something

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:45.660
that's on the front page of
the paper every single day,

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.750
and therefore is pretty intense.

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:51.630
In fact, I wish in many
cases that more projects

00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:53.440
were that urgent.

00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.540
Because then they would
actually get fixed.

00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:00.750
But Mike Bracken, who runs the
Government Digital Service is

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:04.320
always teasing us
about the way Americans

00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:06.190
do things is through crisis.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:09.765
The way Britain does, we
actually get ahead of the game.

00:42:09.765 --> 00:42:12.640
But if you look at what's
going on in federal government

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.030
right now, and in
local government,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:19.170
it's not 20 hour days,
100 days straight.

00:42:19.170 --> 00:42:21.840
There's a whole
team now under 18F,

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.450
which is the sort
of implementation

00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:27.680
arm of our digital services
play, in federal government.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:31.780
They've got about 50 people
now doing digital services,

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.140
right in the federal government.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:36.140
And they work regular
hours on projects

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:40.730
that aren't about to kill
the president's major policy

00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:43.500
agenda.

00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:47.850
So yeah, it is mostly
sort of normal jobs.

00:42:47.850 --> 00:42:52.097
I would also say that I think
Mikey's intake form, which

00:42:52.097 --> 00:42:53.930
is still up-- you
probably have all seen it.

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:58.082
It's still a great way to just
sort of signal your interest.

00:42:58.082 --> 00:42:59.790
If you're interested
in Code for America,

00:42:59.790 --> 00:43:01.373
we've got a lot on
the side about what

00:43:01.373 --> 00:43:03.480
it's like to be a Fellow,
that you can look at.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:04.564
You could also talk to me.

00:43:04.564 --> 00:43:06.854
And then the problem with
the federal government stuff,

00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:08.655
if it just depends on
where you want to go.

00:43:08.655 --> 00:43:11.030
But starting by putting your
email out there, and someone

00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:14.270
will contact you,
is a good way to go.

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:16.990
I'm happy to talk to you more
about what your interests are.

00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:18.950
AUDIENCE: This is--
Google is my first company

00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:20.120
outside of government.

00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.220
Previously I worked in
NYC Digital, and also--

00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:22.760
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Oh, cool.

00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:23.520
AUDIENCE 3: --in
the White House,

00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:25.510
as the Secretary of the
Presidential Innovation

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.045
Committee, before you arrived.

00:43:27.045 --> 00:43:27.320
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Oh, great.

00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:28.957
AUDIENCE: And so
I think we share

00:43:28.957 --> 00:43:30.040
a lot of common interests.

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.600
And the reason I left was
because of the Snowden

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:33.280
revelations.

00:43:33.280 --> 00:43:34.650
And I just found that
I couldn't convince

00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:36.080
people to trust the
government with--

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:36.870
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Yeah.

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:39.286
AUDIENCE: --with their data,
in a way that I could before.

00:43:39.286 --> 00:43:40.954
And l sort of lost hope.

00:43:40.954 --> 00:43:43.370
So I'm wondering if in the
year that you were at the White

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:47.400
House, was there any push-back
from OSTP against NSA

00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.140
surveillance?

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.750
And do you have a message
for people like myself, who

00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:52.930
want to still continue
to be in public service,

00:43:52.930 --> 00:43:56.120
and use these skills
towards open data,

00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.730
but don't know how to
rationalize mass surveillance?

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:01.320
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Sure.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.390
It's a great question.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.050
When I was at the White
House, I saw firsthand

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.530
the way that the tech
industry can and should

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:12.580
continue to use the
fact that, I think

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:15.560
the federal government gets that
its Silicon Valley that's going

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.380
to save it.

00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.080
And yes, we should
use that as leverage

00:44:19.080 --> 00:44:21.320
to ask for what's
right around the rest

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.280
of the federal government.

00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:24.890
So the president,
while I was there,

00:44:24.890 --> 00:44:30.650
held a meeting with some top
folks in the tech industry.

00:44:30.650 --> 00:44:34.100
I believe your CEO was--
well, your CEO was there.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.475
And the first part
of the meeting

00:44:35.475 --> 00:44:36.980
was to talk about
digital services.

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:38.896
And the second part was
to talk about the NSA.

00:44:38.896 --> 00:44:41.632
I was excused for the
second part of that.

00:44:41.632 --> 00:44:43.720
Because there was a lot
of sensitive information

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.650
that was shared.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.340
My personal belief on it-- and
I speak just as a citizen--

00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.205
is that I'm not OK with
what is going on there.

00:44:51.205 --> 00:44:52.830
On the other hand,
that's not an excuse

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.530
not to help the people in
our country who need help.

00:44:55.530 --> 00:44:57.220
AUDIENCE: One question
from the Dory.

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.540
Jonathan Betts is asking,
how can lessons-- sorry,

00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:03.610
I should-- how can lessons
learned through experiences

00:45:03.610 --> 00:45:06.780
like Healthcare.gov scale
across all people and government

00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:07.971
responsible for technology?

00:45:07.971 --> 00:45:10.220
JENNIFER PAHLKA: I think
there's two levels of answer.

00:45:10.220 --> 00:45:13.420
And the first one is, the
Digital Services Playbook--

00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.890
and I showed a
screenshot of it--

00:45:14.890 --> 00:45:18.254
is the lessons learned
from Healthcare.gov.

00:45:18.254 --> 00:45:20.170
Well, and from every
other technology project.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:21.900
But the failure
of Healthcare.gov

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:26.470
gave that a lot more prominence,
and a lot more political

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:30.680
power, than it would have if
we hadn't just had that crisis.

00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.490
So the Playbook is now there.

00:45:33.490 --> 00:45:34.490
It's a good playbook.

00:45:34.490 --> 00:45:36.780
I think somebody on O'Reilly
Radar wrote it up as,

00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:40.050
'not a playbook not just for
government, any private sector

00:45:40.050 --> 00:45:42.790
company should
follow this playbook.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:45.180
The problem is that you
can know what to do.

00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:46.680
You can know what's
right, and still

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.560
have challenges
within a culture,

00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:51.470
in a bureaucracy that's done
it differently for a long time.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:54.010
And so in order
for those practices

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:58.130
to actually scale in
practice-- can I say that?

00:45:58.130 --> 00:46:00.240
The practices of
scale in practice--

00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.730
we need to support the
people in government

00:46:02.730 --> 00:46:04.820
who run into obstacles.

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:09.595
And so Mikey's team is basically
piloting a way to do that.

00:46:09.595 --> 00:46:13.940
That then they can take-- each
time they run into an obstacle,

00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:17.220
whether it's a legal obstacle,
a [INAUDIBLE] obstacle, an HR

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.770
obstacle-- they're figuring out
how to sort of blow that up.

00:46:19.770 --> 00:46:22.490
And then documenting
how they blew that up,

00:46:22.490 --> 00:46:24.140
and then getting that out there.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:25.930
So what's that great line?

00:46:25.930 --> 00:46:27.760
The difference between
theory and practice

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.095
is always greater in theory
that it is in practice?

00:46:30.095 --> 00:46:31.790
Did I say that right?

00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:33.680
Practice than it is in-- OK.

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:37.720
Point is the recipe is there.

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.270
It's going to take a long time
before people are actually

00:46:40.270 --> 00:46:42.560
following it.

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.960
And that's where,
again-- thank you

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.460
for the setup
question, Jonathan.

00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.520
It comes back to,
it doesn't work

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.780
if you don't have
people who know

00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:54.520
how to build digital
services that way there.

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:59.080
And don't accept a different
way of doing things.

00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:00.134
And can normalize it.

00:47:00.134 --> 00:47:01.800
And can say, well,
we won't-- you know--

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.530
I know that seems radical here.

00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:06.710
But that really is how effective
digital services are built,

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:07.477
I guarantee it.

00:47:07.477 --> 00:47:09.810
Then it makes people feel a
little bit more comfortable.

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.854
So we have to have the people
there to back up the playbook.

00:47:13.854 --> 00:47:15.770
AUDIENCE: Working with
San Francisco is great.

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:17.814
And there's people
around here, at Google

00:47:17.814 --> 00:47:18.980
who will come help out.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:21.230
But how do you scale this
to sort of local governments

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:22.270
around the country?

00:47:22.270 --> 00:47:22.990
There's so many.

00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:24.531
And there's just
really not like-- it

00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:28.107
seems like not enough tech
talent to take this abroad.

00:47:28.107 --> 00:47:29.440
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Thank you, yes.

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.580
So the question of scaling
it to local governments

00:47:31.580 --> 00:47:33.290
is what we spend
most of our time on.

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:34.915
Here, I'll hold it
for the next person.

00:47:34.915 --> 00:47:35.490
Thanks.

00:47:35.490 --> 00:47:38.820
So Steph mentioned our summit.

00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:44.110
So the plan has been basically,
show what's possible.

00:47:44.110 --> 00:47:46.170
Spread the stories
of what's possible.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:47.784
Get more people interested.

00:47:47.784 --> 00:47:50.200
And then give them the tools
to solve the problem as well.

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:54.490
But they first have to believe
that the old way is not

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:55.220
necessary, right?

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:57.400
That there's a better
way, and that it's doable.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.360
And so we've been working
really hard on that.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:04.420
Our Fellowship program itself
doesn't scale very well.

00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.510
It's extremely intense.

00:48:06.510 --> 00:48:08.680
What we can do though is
scale the outputs of it.

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:10.555
And so we've built a
series of other programs

00:48:10.555 --> 00:48:13.940
that do that, including a
network of people in government

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:16.930
who sort of have
drunk the Kool-Aid.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:18.690
Then we need to
empower them, to help

00:48:18.690 --> 00:48:22.050
them pilot these things
in their own cities.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:25.550
And in that essentially is
the play that we're running.

00:48:25.550 --> 00:48:28.030
It gets a little bit more
sophisticated every year.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:30.920
And it gets more sophisticated,
because we get more resources.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:34.780
We have been a very,
very small organization.

00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:37.370
Now we're about
almost at 40 people.

00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:39.537
We could easily be 4,000
people, and we still

00:48:39.537 --> 00:48:40.870
wouldn't have fixed the problem.

00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:42.400
But we'll get there.

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.780
Because it's about
building the network.

00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.090
It's not just us, right?

00:48:46.090 --> 00:48:47.774
It's the people in
government who do it.

00:48:47.774 --> 00:48:49.940
AUDIENCE: You mentioned the
criminal justice system.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:50.840
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Mm hm.

00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:51.730
AUDIENCE: And I think
it's, right now,

00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:53.188
it's kind of an
interesting tipping

00:48:53.188 --> 00:48:54.670
point in the public
consciousness,

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:57.950
about what-- about
reform, and I'm actually

00:48:57.950 --> 00:49:01.180
working with a nonprofit
that's looking at helping--

00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:03.820
or has specifically
asked Googlers or tech

00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.620
people, to open up
some of the tracking

00:49:06.620 --> 00:49:10.200
that we do for people that are
in the criminal justice system.

00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:11.679
JENNIFER PAHLKA: We should talk.

00:49:11.679 --> 00:49:13.220
AUDIENCE: But anyway,
I was wondering

00:49:13.220 --> 00:49:14.803
since I don't have
a lot of time like,

00:49:14.803 --> 00:49:17.250
is there anything specific in
the criminal justice system

00:49:17.250 --> 00:49:19.010
that you guys are working
on that's exciting?

00:49:19.010 --> 00:49:21.051
JENNIFER PAHLKA: Yeah,
thank you for asking that.

00:49:21.051 --> 00:49:23.480
It's actually the area that
I'm most excited about.

00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:27.010
We have identified three
areas of focus for our work

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:27.700
next year.

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.574
It doesn't mean we won't
do some other stuff.

00:49:29.574 --> 00:49:33.530
But our Fellowship cities
and Fellows next year

00:49:33.530 --> 00:49:36.130
are going to be focusing
on safety and justice,

00:49:36.130 --> 00:49:38.260
economic development, and
health, which is really

00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.520
the human services work, a
continuation of the stuff I

00:49:40.520 --> 00:49:42.560
just showed.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:46.280
I have become sort
of outraged I think,

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.710
at the way our criminal
justice system is working.

00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:50.960
And it's absolutely
true that a lot of that

00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.790
is due to terrible policy.

00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:56.280
But an enormous amount of
it is due to incompetence

00:49:56.280 --> 00:49:57.790
of the system.

00:49:57.790 --> 00:49:59.455
We can't get people
out of jail--

00:49:59.455 --> 00:50:01.080
you know, people who
are held pre-trial

00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:01.997
that don't need to be.

00:50:01.997 --> 00:50:03.746
There was the article
that you've probably

00:50:03.746 --> 00:50:06.380
seen in The New Yorker about
the young man in New York, who

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.060
spent three-- who went
into Rikers at 16,

00:50:09.060 --> 00:50:12.080
and was held without a
trial for three years.

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:13.760
A lot of that is
simply the system

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:16.662
can't just tie it's own
shoelaces in the morning.

00:50:16.662 --> 00:50:18.120
There is an enormous
amount that we

00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:23.070
could do using data to get
people not held pre-trial.

00:50:23.070 --> 00:50:25.530
And there are all sorts of
follow-on effects to that.

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.113
If they're not held,
they're much more

00:50:27.113 --> 00:50:29.590
likely to be not
convicted of the crime.

00:50:29.590 --> 00:50:31.100
There's an enormous
amount that we

00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.650
can do to keep people from
getting bench warrants.

00:50:34.650 --> 00:50:36.390
So a bench warrant
is what you get

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.302
if you rode your
bike on the sidewalk,

00:50:38.302 --> 00:50:40.760
and got a little teeny ticket
that shouldn't be a big deal.

00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.540
But then you never
followed up on it,

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:43.600
and you never cleared it.

00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:45.474
And suddenly the next
time you're pulled over

00:50:45.474 --> 00:50:47.420
for something, boom,
you're in jail.

00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:49.570
We have a lot of people
in the criminal justice

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:53.370
system for very, very petty
crimes that don't need to be,

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:56.340
if we can just make the
system work a lot better.

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.100
We are interested both in the
public safety side of it--

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.790
how can we make our
communities safer?

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:06.130
And then how can we make
that system far more just,

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:08.540
using data?

00:51:08.540 --> 00:51:11.450
We did a jail
management dashboard

00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:13.740
in Louisville,
Kentucky, that actually

00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:16.060
[INAUDIBLE] who was a
Googler that worked on.

00:51:16.060 --> 00:51:17.800
It was sort of
his major project.

00:51:17.800 --> 00:51:20.737
That's now being
redeployed to Denver.

00:51:20.737 --> 00:51:22.320
But it gets at like
this basic problem

00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.700
that people literally don't
even know who-- they can't even

00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:30.410
look at who is in
the jails, and manage

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.050
that population in any way.

00:51:33.050 --> 00:51:34.740
We've done these
court date reminders.

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.320
So that people who need to show
up to clear a parking ticket,

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.440
can either just do it
through their mobile phone,

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.139
or can be reminded
that they actually

00:51:43.139 --> 00:51:44.180
need to show up in court.

00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:46.120
So they don't end up
getting a bench warrant,

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.780
and reduce the
number of people who

00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:51.660
are like jamming up the system.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:56.210
It is probably, after--
name the top things, NSA,

00:51:56.210 --> 00:52:00.070
and Guantanamo River-- like one
of our biggest national shames

00:52:00.070 --> 00:52:00.570
right now.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:03.550
We should be terribly ashamed
of how our criminal justice

00:52:03.550 --> 00:52:04.590
system works.

00:52:04.590 --> 00:52:05.970
And we have to do better.

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:08.360
So we're going to focus
on that pretty heavily

00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.020
in the coming three years.

00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:10.520
Thank you.

00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:12.070
[APPLAUSE]
