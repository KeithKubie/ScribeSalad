00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.120
Imagine you dedicated your adult life to helping
those less fortunate than yourself -that you

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.250
spent your entire adult life trying to make
the world a better place, and when you died

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.161
(after sacrificing your own life for someone
else’s) all most people remembered about

00:00:22.161 --> 00:00:25.300
you was that you once ran really fast…

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.750
You’d be pretty annoyed right?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.950
Well that’s what happened to Eric Liddell.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.800
Although, as you’ll see, he probably wouldn’t
have minded.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.910
Liddell is mostly famous for being one of
the subjects of the film Chariots of Fire,

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.880
along with running buddy, Harold Abrahams.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.870
If you’re unfamiliar with the film or just
want to see us clumsily stumble our way through

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.890
describing the plot, the film basically follows
Liddell and Abrahams through their university

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.700
years up to their respective individual gold
medal wins at the 1924 Paris Olympics.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.489
The film is noted to be fairly true to actual
events, give or take a few creative liberties.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.359
For example, one of the films most iconic
scenes and one of the reasons Liddell himself

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.100
is so famous is when he refused to compete
in the 100 metre heat because it took place

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.100
on a Sunday.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.080
As a devout Christian, Liddell steadfastly
refused to run any race taking place on the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.080
Sabbath.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.360
In the film, this decision is made on Liddell’s
journey to Paris from Britain.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.190
However, in real life Liddell was well aware
of when the race took place several months

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.240
in advance and planned appropriately, mainly
training instead for the 400 metre race.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.670
Liddell was harassed for months about his
decision and was even reportedly “grilled”

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.530
by the British Olympic Committee, particularly
because the 100 metre was his best event and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.950
his best time in the 400 metre (49.6 seconds)
had little chance of winning anything in the

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:42.970
Olympics.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.310
Despite this, he didn’t back down on the
issue.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.860
Long story short, when the 400 metre final
rolled around, Liddell, defied the odds and

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.780
won the event with a world record performance
(47.6 seconds).

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:59.450
A performance usually attributed to the fact
that Liddell treated the race as a dead sprint,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.770
running all 400 metres as fast as he possibly
could.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.810
To quote the man himself when asked about
his plan for victory.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.450
I run the first 200m as hard as I can.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
Then, for the second 200m, with God’s help,
I run harder.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.250
Now we don’t want to downplay how impressive
this achievement was, but it’s child’s

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.470
play compared to what Liddell did next.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.570
We didn’t mention it in the intro, but Liddell
was originally born in China prior to being

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.160
raised and educated in Scotland.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.680
In fact, due to this, he’s often regarded
as one of China’s first Olympic champions

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.860
on top of all the other stuff he did.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.700
A year after his Olympic victory in 1925,
Liddell went back to China to serve as a missionary

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.520
like his parents before him had done.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.670
For a few years, Liddell served as both a
science and sports teacher at a college in

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.920
the Chinese city of Tianjin, the same city
in which he was born.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.890
After 12 years, Liddell opted to become an
ordained minister and then continued his work

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.990
spreading the word of God in the Xiaochang
county as an evangelist and humanitarian.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.290
While serving there, Liddell rescued two wounded
Chinese soldiers, despite the significant

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.450
risk involved.

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.060
Other stories tell of Liddell refusing to
travel with an armed guard when visiting sick

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.630
and needy people because relying on a gun
instead of God wasn’t his thing.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:10.850
Why was this all so risky?

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.060
At this time, the Japanese were attacking
China and Liddell ran the risk of being shot

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.150
every time he walked out of the door.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.850
The situation was so dangerous that the British
government advised him and other British citizens

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.050
to leave the country.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.740
Liddell’s family left, but he stayed to
work at a mission station setup to help the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.740
poor.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.130
However, his luck eventually ran out and when
Tianjin fell under Japanese control; Liddell

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.680
was sent to an internment camp in Weihsien
in March of 1943.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.710
Though his situation was certainly dire, his
spirit certainly didn’t wane and while some

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.630
people in the camp selfishly hoarded their
supplies, Liddell spent his time teaching

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.850
children and sharing what he had.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.590
When a few rich businessmen managed to convince
the guards to smuggle them in extra rations,

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.480
Liddell’s natural charisma was such that
he was able to convince them to share the

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.730
food with everyone, and he was the first port
of call when any dispute in the camp needed

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.730
to be settled.

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.470
He even reportedly finally took part in a
sporting event on a Sunday.

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:03.830
A fight broke out in game.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.460
To stop it, Liddell, who was well respected
by all in the camp, stepped in and then after

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.240
things settled down volunteered to referee
the rest of the match.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.600
Given this wasn’t about his own glory, but
rather about keeping the peace, it presumably

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.720
didn’t conflict with his ideology.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.180
If you’re not impressed yet with Liddell’s
integrity.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.220
Here’s the part that really shows you the
kind of man he was.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.720
While in the camp, Liddell was ravaged by
malnourishment and ill health.

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.870
(It was later found that he had a brain tumor,
but he knew nothing of this.)

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.310
Despite this, when Winston Churchill managed
to secure Liddell’s freedom in a prisoner

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.870
exchange, Liddell declined and instead offered
his place to a pregnant woman who was also

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.300
in the camp, saving not only her life but
her unborn child as well.

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.630
Besides his declining health, this must have
been a particularly difficult decision given

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.120
that he had a wife and three daughters he
hadn’t seen in well over a year; one of

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.940
them, Maureen, he never got a chance to know.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.490
Much like most of his life’s work, he didn’t
do this for any sort of fame or recognition.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.419
In fact, he didn’t even mention this fact
to his family in subsequent letters.

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.870
In his last letter to his wife as his health
deteriorated, he simply mentioned that he

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.040
thought he was perhaps overworked.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.250
On the 21st of February 1945, just a few months
before the camp was liberated, Liddell died.

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.949
Now, after reading about how Liddell spent
over a decade in China helping others, some

00:05:20.949 --> 00:05:24.950
of the time voluntarily in a war-zone, and
how he gave away his one chance at freedom

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.630
for the life of a virtual stranger when he
was in ill health and desperately in need

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.660
of a doctor, perhaps the fact that he could
move his legs slightly faster than other athletic

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.600
humans for 400 metres isn’t the thing we
should all be remembering him for.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.770
It’s true that athletic events have the
power to inspire us and that can be very important;

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.770
but in the end, it’s typically superficial.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:51.070
This is a rare case of an athlete doing something
even more meaningful, and no less inspirational.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.850
As Liddell said when asked about walking away
from athletics at the peak of his career to

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.050
become a missionary and humanitarian: “It’s
natural for a chap to think over all that

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.220
sometimes, but I’m glad I’m at the work
I’m engaged in now.

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.370
A fellow’s life counts for far more at this
than the other.”

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.250
We’ll leave off this one with a quote about
Liddell from Langdon Gilkey, a fellow survivor

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.490
of the camp the two were prisoners in:

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.530
Often in an evening I would see him bent over
a chessboard or a model boat, or directing

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.670
some sort of square dance – absorbed, weary
and interested, pouring all of himself into

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.200
this effort to capture the imagination of
these penned-up youths.

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.840
He was overflowing with good humour and love
for life, and with enthusiasm and charm.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.419
It is rare indeed that a person has the good
fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:56.540
to it as anyone I have ever known.
