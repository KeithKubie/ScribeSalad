00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.320
 You just finished building your application and it looks great. 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.950
 If we stop here because you're ready to rest, right? 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.897
 its wrong. 

00:00:06.897 --> 00:00:10.010
 I'm David East, and I'm here to convince you that you're not over yet, 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.160
 Because you need to build a tool. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.136
 But first, what is the tool? 

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:17.140
 Well, the tool is a single display that passes to another application, 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.650
 As the main screen application. 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.430
 This offer is displayed as part of its design. 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.320
 This view becomes a window to access your app 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.650
 From the Home or Lock screen. 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.950
 Here the magic begins, 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.870
 You can use that tool to display information that is important to your app users 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.530
 And to bring them back to your app. 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.450
 This means that you have the opportunity 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.516
 To be an essential part of the mobile user experience. 

00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:43.360
 This is very cool. 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.490
 Take for example a single non-interactive tool, 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:46.680
 As a weather application. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.640
 It can display the temperature above a bright sun, 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.360
 Quickly show the weather on the home screen. 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.010
 You have now got a grateful user, 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.990
 Because they do not have to open the application 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.900
 Just to lose the weather. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.830
 But tools can do things, not just display information. 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.580
 So supply this presentation with the information done. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.420
 Click on the offer The user should be taken to a deep link in your app 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.140
 But do not just move it to the basic activity view. 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.730
 But instead think of another suitable place, 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.430
 Such as the weather report for the week. 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.270
 Another useful tool is the status switch. 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 You may want to display the signal strength of the wireless network at the moment. 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.860
 This is your offer. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.650
 A click on this display may turn on or off the network, 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.110
 Without having to go to the Settings application. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.090
 This is very useful. 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.120
 But these are just simple hints of what these tools can do for you and your users. 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.230
 For example the calendar tool. 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.130
 Where the display can change its size to fill any space given to it by the user 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.720
 While viewing all events on this day. 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.190
 Clicking the event will go to its details page. 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.250
 Scrolling through the list will show you everything you can not offer. 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.950
 Your view of the list does not mean that you can not add a quick add button, 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.300
 So to create a new event easily and with a single click. 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.120
 The tools are great, because they enable you to make your application useful to users, 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.400
 Even if they do not open them. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.370
 You can then return users to your app, 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.002
 Because you are tempted by the completion of some work. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 So, check out the documentation to learn more about the tools 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.400
 And look at what tools can do for you. 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.230
 But most important is to continue to build better applications.
