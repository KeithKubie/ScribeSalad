00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.700
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.600
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Thank so
much, Gabriel and everyone else

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.190
and Melodias Borinqueñas
for a beautiful concert.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.440 position:56%
You guys are clearly way up there
in terms of skill level and in terms

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.900
of taste, what you
might call or something.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.630
Just beauty of every
sort in your performance.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:42.930
&gt;&gt; Daniel Muñoz: Thanks so much.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.230
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Thanks
so much for that.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.110
Thanks for working for 25 years to
-- just to come here to the Library

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.480
of Congress, this concert today.

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.870
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I think I
can die in peace after this.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.170
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: There you go.

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.220
Beautiful, but don't do it.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.020
So can we start with
who is Gabriel Muñoz?

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.780
Who is that person?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.150
If you were somebody
else and they asked you

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.600
who Gabriel Muñoz was,
what would you say?

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.860
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: It's
such a complex question,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.360
but as some of you already know,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.880
I was born in Hatillo
[spelling?], Puerto Rico.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.460
I guess to find a better
life, my parents moved

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.550
to New Jersey, where I was raised.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.880 position:56%
The most difficult question I
always have to answer is how I ended

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.500
up playing this instrument

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.590
and furthermore having a
passion and love for it?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.890
I have no clue.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.190
I'll be honest with you.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.630
Being raised over here
since the age of two,

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.330
it still baffles me how
I ended up doing this.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.830
I can, however, say that it was --

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.900
basically began with watching
someone play at the age of 14,

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:55.060
and I've never seen this instrument
in front of me physically,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.690
only on old cassettes or such

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.420
that my father would play
the old jíbero music,

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.060
and it kind of fascinated me, but
I didn't understand what it was.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.950
Once I saw it, it enchanted
me instantly.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.020
I loved the whole chorus
effect, natural chorus effect

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.770
that the instrument had and
how it portrayed itself.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.900
It just stood out on its own,
and I felt like I really --

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.390
I really want to do that.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.170
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well we're all
thankful that you decided that.

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.970
That was a good moment for us.

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.560
You go back to Hatillo
[spelling] at all?

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.860
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.390
At the age of ten, my Dad
started taking me back

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.680
so that I would know my family,
my grandmother and grandfather

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.450
on his side and such, and every
so often, every couple of years,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.270
I continued going back until I was
old enough to travel on my own,

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.570
and to this day, I still go.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.080
Now, I go -- it's at the point
where I go, and it's just meeting

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.890
with different cuartristas and
playing and playing and playing.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.300
When I get the chance,
I'll see the family,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.190
but now it's just I'm
always playing now.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.820
So -- but yeah, it's
always fun to go back

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.190
and recharge my cultural batteries
and musical batteries and meet

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.910
up with a lot of great
musicians over there.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.210
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Let me ask you.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.680
Who is on those cassettes
that your father played?

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.630
Do you know at this point in time?

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.330
Who were your -- who would
you go back and meet with?

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.510
Where did you get this -- where
do you recharge your batteries,

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.810
with whom?

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.480
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I remember my
father playing a lot of cassettes

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.040
from the late great
cuatro player Maso Rivera,

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.020 position:56%
which is one of the biggest pioneers

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:37.760
on the real typical
folklore music on the cuatro.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.760
It had such -- I guess I would
interpret it as some type

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.610
of jíbero-funk type feel with it
that really brought out the pride

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.880
of the music in itself,
and that's someone

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.460
that I never had the opportunity
to meet before he passed away

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.340
but till this day one of the
biggest inspirations on --

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.060
the whole reason for me really
wanting to push out on the culture

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.390
with the music was Maso Rivera.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.140
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Maso Rivera.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.320
And so what about Ladi
[Ladislao Martínez]

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.820
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Ladi
-- I consider Ladi

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.530
to be the godfather
of the modern cuatro.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.320
La D is the person who made
the modern cuatro famous,

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:20.970
the ten strings, the shape, all
this came through evolution.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.560 position:56%
I understand that cuatro had
different looks throughout the years

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.780
since its creation, but Ladi
deserves so much in my perspective

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.120
so much reverence and
honor for what he did

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.860 position:56%
in modernizing the instrument itself
and style of technique he used

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.570
to play and the music he used.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.130
He composed so many songs, so
many songs, hundreds of songs

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.670
that until this day are standards
for cuatritas to learn from.

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:50.900
I can never go without
mentioning Ladi.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.150
To this day, we still try,
try to learn one or two

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.970
of his songs and perform.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.650
Like I said, he's the
godfather of the modern cuatro.

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.840
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well now
that we're on the cuatro,

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.110
tell us about the cuatro.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.750
For someone who's never seen
the cuatro, doesn't know it.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.950
Why -- first of all, the ten
strings and it's called cuatro.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.250
What's that all about?

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.550
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.340
I mean, there's -- I've heard
so many different stories

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.000
in Puerto Rico and over here

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.510
about how the Puerto Rican cuatro
had evolved and has evolved.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.360
One of the things was
what you just mentioned.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.660
Why cuatro?

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.400
Cuatro means 'number
four' in Spanish.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.460
So one of the things I learned
was that it had four strings

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.760
when it first started evolving.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.830
As time went by, I guess
with different artisans

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.540
and luthiers experimenting, making
instruments, they decided to make

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.990
or add strings, change the shape.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.120 position:56%
To this day, even in this year 2016,

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.590 position:56%
I see different luthiers
experimenting with different styles,

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.590
shapes and looks -- adding
strings, removing strings.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.330
A lot of the times it's just a
preference of the musician himself.

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.090
Ladi, for example, he
asked for ten strings.

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.540
There's another cuatrita
by the name of --

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.620
known as Totas Feliciano
[spelling?].

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.980
He was one of the original pioneers

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.410
of where the cuatro hadn't even
evolved yet, had four strings,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.220
six strings, eight strings, and as
these guys went along, they added,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.270
modified - but Ladi really made the
ten-string popular, the violin look

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.130
with the ten strings was the
modern cuatro that Ladi made.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:29.340
&gt;&gt;Daniel Sheehy: The
violin look, with the...

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:30.640
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.360
The violin with the -- as
European music influenced a lot

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:41.280 position:56%
in Puerto Rico, the jíbaro, as we
call [him] wanted to feel some sense

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:47.200
of sophistication, some sense of
acceptance in the higher class,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.810
and they kind of copied
the violin shape

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.950
since that represented the violin,
a lot of the classical music

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:59.870
and modern style, higher class
music and so the countrymen,

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:07.110
the peasant of Puerto Rico thought,
"hey, that shape signifies this."

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.330
And they wanted to add to
that so they figured that's

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.140
where Ladi made this famous with
the modern Puerto Rican cuatro.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:15.550
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So,
as far as you know.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:20.940 position:56%
Ladi was the one who really made
that the standard, that shape there?

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.280 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah, once -- I
can't tell you he specifically asked

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.330
for this shape, but I
do know that once Ladi -

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.930
Ladi Martinez is his full name
- once Ladi started coming

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.860
out on the radio performing live,

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.290
people would hear him
all over the island.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:44.380
He was one of the first ones to
come out on the air performing.

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:47.660
Everyone around the island wanted
to know what was that cuatro,

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.990
that instrument he was playing.

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:53.140
Once they saw it, everyone's
baffled, and it just kind

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.330
of took off like wild fire.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.290
Everyone ordering cuatros
made the same way,

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:01.640
and it became the standard
cuatro after Ladi.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:05.020
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And I think
didn't he have two cuatros

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.820
in his ensembles?

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.120
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.270
It was Ladi and he had a
cousin named Sarrail Archilla,

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:13.520
if I'm not mistaken,
one of his own cousins

00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.230
that would play harmony
to his songs....

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:17.530
&gt;&gt; Anibal Ortiz: Duo?

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.830
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: His duo,
yeah, to all his pieces.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:20.500
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do you
ever do that yourself or --

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.650
you had one cuatro [inaudible]?

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:23.950
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:25.930
We predominantly tend
to have the one cuatro,

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:27.930
but once in a while
we'll get together

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:32.520
with another fellow cuatro player
and try to work on a double -

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:34.540
two-part piece or something.

00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.400
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What
are the advantages

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.480
of having just one cuatro?

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.900
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I guess you
have more room to improvise

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.350
and to just have fun and let go,
sort of like what I do on stage.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.690
When you have two cuatros
and you have to kind of try

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.010
to stay organized section just to
harmonize with the second cuatro.

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.680
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So we're talking
about the cuatro [inaudible].

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.210
Can you just give a
little sound or tell us --

00:09:01.210 --> 00:09:03.980
people who might not have heard
this before or close up like this?

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.790
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah,
well what I love

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:11.010
about this instrument also I
consider the 12-string guitar,

00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.810
the American guitar,
12 steel string.

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.330
It has -- being that
the strings are doubled,

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:21.100
it kind of gives a
natural chorus effect.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.470
You see a lot of rock guitars
and such that will plug

00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:27.640
up to an amplifier, let's
say, or an effects pedal,

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.740
and it'll add a chorus effect.

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:33.540
This has a natural --
a chorus effect just

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:36.030
by having the double strings
as also the 12-string guitar,

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:39.370
which is something
that just fascinates me

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.200
and so this is what it sounds like.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:48.090
[Plays a chord.] So
it's difficult to tell,

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:53.830
but if you have the patience
and the ear to listen to it,

00:09:53.830 --> 00:09:57.180
the waves kind sort of -- the
sound waves sort of go like this,

00:09:57.180 --> 00:10:00.310
and you can kind of feel
that vibration as opposed

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.250
to a single string -- if I were
to play [plays single string]--

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:05.950
if I'm playing the double,

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:10.700
it has sort of a more
robust or fuller sound.

00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.170
And that's something that always
stuck in my ear when I would watch

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.330
or listen to anyone play.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.550
My thing is to listen
to their technique.

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:23.290
How do they use that
to their advantage?

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.490
And that kind of resonates
with me the most.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.700
One of which is Edwin Colón Zayas

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:34.310
that has practically dominated
almost every genre that exists

00:10:34.310 --> 00:10:36.160
for the Puerto Rican cuatro.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.360
His technique is beyond phenomenal.

00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:41.750 position:56%
And that's something that I always
pay attention to when I watch people

00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:43.050
and listen to people play.

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:45.750
How do they use that to
their advantage, of course,

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.050
using their own technique.

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:50.020
Every musician developed
their own style and technique.

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:54.770
And Edwin has kind of
dominated every part

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:56.660
of the cuatro to this day.

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:00.340 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: When you play the
Bach, for some reason my mind jumped

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:02.620
to his version of "The
Flight of the Bumble Bee."

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:03.920
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yes.

00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.260
Yes. Exactly.

00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:11.210 position:56%
Like I said, he's kind of dominated
everything since the 80s, I believe.

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.370
Edwin has been tinkering
with classical music,

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:17.390 position:56%
and every time he puts an album
out, there's always a classical song

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:22.340
in there, one or two, and it's
just his way of saying, hey,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:27.060 position:56%
the Puerto Rican cuatro can be
mainstream, it can be used for this.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.170
It's inspiring the rest of us.

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:30.470
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What's
your message

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.480
when you include a Bach
Suite, for example, cello?

00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.440
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Basically, I
would say I'm kind of going off

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:44.530
of what Edwin and several
other cuatro players have done.

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:48.500
I don't like to keep the
cuatro inside this box

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.090 position:56%
where it's predominantly just
mountain music, using Christmas time

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:57.950
for like what we consider Christmas
caroling, what we know as parandas

00:11:57.950 --> 00:12:01.200
and it's just jamming,
and we're going house

00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.360
to house Christmas caroling and
that's it the rest of the year

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.190 position:56%
because this instrument is basically
most popular at Christmas time.

00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:10.030
But I like where a lot
of cuatritas are going,

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:11.590
where they're just
taking it out of that box

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:14.390
and say here, there's
some bluegrass.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:16.400
Here's some R and B.
Here's some classical.

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.850
Here's this, here's that.

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:20.360
And I kind of like the
idea and the concept

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:24.010
of making it a little bit more
mainstream because I feel,

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:26.080
obviously, it'll reach
more cultures, more people

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.580
and say hey here's
this instrument just

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:30.900
in case you didn't know it existed.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.360
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: You lived in New
Jersey for a long time now, right?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:34.880
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yes, sir.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yomo
Toro, you run across him?

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:39.280
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I
had the opportunity

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.700
of meeting him on two occasions.

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:46.520
He did -- he frequented New Jersey
a lot, and he did come to my area

00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:49.910
in Trenton where I reside,
to perform on two occasions.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.150
I had the -- I didn't have the
privilege and honor of performing

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:55.050
with him, but I got to
sit and watch this great,

00:12:55.050 --> 00:12:57.300
great legend and master perform.

00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:58.600
I'll be honest with you.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.540
I wouldn't want to
even take my instrument

00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.210
out of the case in front of him.

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:05.200
I mean, it's just I
honored him so much.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:10.230
He's always another inspiration
with his style and genre tapping

00:13:10.230 --> 00:13:16.820 position:56%
into the salsa world, something that
I believe he made popular with a lot

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:20.980
of old school salsa singers,
Celia Cruz, Willie Colon

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:24.600
and La Fania All Stars Group
that was formed in the 70s.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:29.220
I remember the story
of him being requested

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:31.900
at the recording studio
for a salsa album.

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:33.700
They told him bring
the electric guitar.

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:36.650 position:56%
Bring your friend or we're going to
put some rock guitar into the salsa.

00:13:36.650 --> 00:13:38.650
Give it some kind of fusion.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.280
The day comes to record, and
Yomo shows up at the studio

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.660
with his cuatro on his back.

00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:47.580
And Willie Colon, one of the
producers of the album said,

00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.000
"We're not recording
Christmas music.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.670
This isn't jíbaro music
from the mountains."

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.230 position:56%
And Yomo says, "I'm a cuatro player.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:54.530
This is what I play."

00:13:54.530 --> 00:13:55.830
The rest was history.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:57.520
He made that popular
everywhere he went.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.110
I mean, they traveled the world,
Africa, Japan, you name it.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:03.860 position:56%
And the cuatro was front and center
with that, and it's people like that

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:05.960
that we have to give thanks to,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:09.560
younger generation
of cuatro players.

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:11.930
We know that there's that
opportunity out there.

00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:13.530
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: That's
a good topic right there.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.100
Can you tell us -- I mean,
you're in circulation.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.400
You go around and hear
different groups

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.590
and they hear you,
and you meet people.

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:23.580
What is happening with the
younger generation and the cuatro?

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:29.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I'm kind of on the
fence on the growth of the cuatro.

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:33.610
I obviously see more
popularity of the cuatro

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:36.690
on the island, in Puerto Rico.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.470
There's -- schools are
starting to make it part

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.320
of the curriculum now
to learn the cuatro.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:46.380
There's a young man by the
name of Pablo Hernandez.

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.950
He's the first in history to
graduate with a Bachelor degree --

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:53.490
Bachelor's degree on the Puerto
Rican cuatro with a concentration

00:14:53.490 --> 00:14:57.810
in jazz, just a month ago in
Puerto Rico, and they're starting

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.760 position:56%
to make it a curriculum now which
is something I'm very proud to know,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.010
and I'm glad to be
alive during this time

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:06.040
where this is coming into fruition.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.480
I wish that over here in the States
more younger people would get

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:13.430
involved not necessarily just
learning to play the instrument,

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.280
but at least learn about it and
learn the culture and be involved

00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.090
with it so that we can pass this
heritage down to our children.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:23.550
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: New
Jersey and New York,

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:26.900
I think have probably been
important places for the cuatro

00:15:26.900 --> 00:15:31.380
and jíbaro ever since Ladi
was around there, right?

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:34.680
It was a major hit
and galvanized people

00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:41.300
and raised their Puerto Rican sense
of self, identity and dignity.

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:46.400
Do you have -- say you
want to renew your roots.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.720
Are there people in New
Jersey, New York, Hartford,

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.020
Connecticut, Chicago or --

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.320
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.620
There's quite a few.

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.920
They're sparse but
there's quite a few.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:59.480
There's a small community, and
I try my best to try to network

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.500
with as many as I can to
keep it going, share music.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:05.260
We sit down and "Hey,
you teach me this song.

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.560
I'll teach you that song.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.860
You teach me this riff.

00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:09.160
I'll teach you that riff."

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.460
Just to stay inspired.

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:12.540
It also keeps you motivated
when you're surrounded

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:15.790
by that type of atmosphere.

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:19.810
You as a musician -- everyone
gets an inspiration, a motivation,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:23.460
an idea, a thought from
someone else or somewhere else,

00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:28.510
so we try to always keep a close
knit relationship with a lot

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:29.810
of -- especially New York.

00:16:29.810 --> 00:16:34.010 position:56%
New York is, I believe, is really
crowded with a lot of cuatro players

00:16:34.010 --> 00:16:36.820
and people that are involved
somehow directly or indirectly

00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.770
with the music of the
Puerto Rican cuatro.

00:16:38.770 --> 00:16:42.630
So we try to reach out to
as many as we possibly can.

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:43.930
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Let me ask you.

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:48.070 position:56%
This is a little bit of an
abstract question, but you've played

00:16:48.070 --> 00:16:51.730
and learned in Puerto Rico,
and you've played and learned

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.820
in New Jersey and New
York, around there.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.120
How is it different?

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:57.420
Is it different?

00:16:57.420 --> 00:16:59.480
Is there a different
feeling or different music?

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.780
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah, there is.

00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:04.460
We actually talk about that a lot.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.530
The styles and techniques
are a bit different.

00:17:07.530 --> 00:17:13.700
Melodies are a bit different in
Puerto Rico then it is over here.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:21.210
Being raised over here, my
influences would be Jimmy Hendrix,

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:25.410
things more popular over here;
whereas over there they live,

00:17:25.410 --> 00:17:29.330
eat and breathe this
instrument 24/7 and everyone

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:31.000
that has played before them.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.300
So they're what I would like
to consider much more hard core

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:36.420
when it comes to the
cuatro, and I hear it.

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:40.420
I'm like they have such a
wonderful flavor to their music,

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.060
such a wonderful flavor that
we try to imitate to the best

00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:46.910
of our ability being
that we're over here.

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:49.790
We have the privilege and honor
of having good rapport with a lot

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:52.260
of musicians in Puerto Rico.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.420
And so they have no problem with
sharing with us anytime we call

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.800
or share videos or
phone calls and ideas.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.960
"Hey, you did something
on this video that I saw.

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:03.260
You played this song.

00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:04.560
How do you do that?"

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.190
And we have no problem sharing.

00:18:06.190 --> 00:18:07.490
"Say, hey, listen.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.790
I'm going to send you the music.

00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.090
I'll send you the video.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.390
Just grab your cuatro.

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.690
We'll be over the phone.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:13.990
We'll just do it over the phone."

00:18:13.990 --> 00:18:15.290
So we have that advantage.

00:18:15.290 --> 00:18:17.100
But yeah, the sound's
a little bit different.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.880
The techniques are a
little bit different

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.730
from over here and over there.

00:18:20.730 --> 00:18:25.380
But generally, cuatro players
and also guitar players

00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:29.840
that accompany the cuatro
for the most part try

00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:34.280
to imitate whatever we can from
the island, which is more pure.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.560
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: They borrowed a
bit, though, in Puerto Rico, right?

00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:42.630
Like from the joropo from
Venezuela or Colombia?

00:18:42.630 --> 00:18:43.930
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:45.230
There's a major --

00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:46.530
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: You
got [inaudible].

00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:47.830
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: There's so
many influences in Puerto Rico.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.130
There's so much to grab from.

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:51.110
There's so much to grab from with
the pasida [spelling?], the joropo,

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:57.640 position:56%
the valse, the paso doble, the
mazurka, what we interpret it today.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:00.160
There is so much to grab for, and
there's a little bit of influence,

00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.460 position:56%
so much, so many different countries
in South America in different areas,

00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:08.750
and this kind of evolved
into this wonderful thing

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:12.830
where we feel we can make
it our own for the cuatro,

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:15.150
and like I mentioned earlier,

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:20.290
we like to consider the
dansa sort of classical form.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:23.780
To me, it's one of the
higher end class of music,

00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:27.250
sort of like ballroom dancing and
stuff like that, and the same thing

00:19:27.250 --> 00:19:29.760
with the valse and the mazurka .

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.020
These are styles and genres
of music that, I really feel,

00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:37.660
you have to put your pants on
right and learn them properly

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:39.070
and interpret them right.

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:43.210
Before or after our performance
today, I was approached by a woman

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:45.600
that said "I'm a classical
guitarist,

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.230
and I saw you play this classical
piece," and she was complimenting.

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.530
And I said, "You know what?

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:52.240
Thank you for telling me that
now and not before I played.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.970
I would have felt so much
more pressure knowing

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.310
that there's an actual classical
guitarist in the midst."

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:03.610
So it's those styles of music
that we take from every country

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:07.260
and have become our own throughout
the years because of people

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.530
like Ladi, because of people
like Maso or Yomo Toro

00:20:10.530 --> 00:20:13.550
and these cuatro players
of the old guard

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.970
that have made those
standards for us.

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:19.510
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: At some point,
we should turn to the music.

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.190
I had one other -- just
to continue on the --

00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:24.210
what the cuatro means to you:

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:28.140
When you were explaining
how you play a string,

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.990
and there's that double little
bit of a vibration that's created

00:20:31.990 --> 00:20:35.180
by the two almost the same pitches.

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:37.670
Also it's against your
body, and I'll just --

00:20:37.670 --> 00:20:38.970
my own impression when you're

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:42.910
on the stage performing
you're really in yourself.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.370
You're in a world there.

00:20:44.370 --> 00:20:47.890
Can you either remember
a time before

00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:53.810 position:56%
where you suddenly felt really
moved or what -- tell us about that.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:55.110
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.030
I guess I try to focus
and concentrate

00:20:58.030 --> 00:21:01.860
on my most intimate
moments with the instrument.

00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.040
It's so simple for us
as instrumentalists

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.320
of any instrument whether it's
the cuatro guitar, piano, violin,

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.100
clarinet, doesn't matter.

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:14.780
We are -- or even vocal singer --
we do our best when we're alone,

00:21:14.780 --> 00:21:16.470
when we're in private
when no one's watching.

00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:17.770
There's no pressure.

00:21:17.770 --> 00:21:19.270
Even in the shower.

00:21:19.270 --> 00:21:20.570
I sing better in the shower.

00:21:20.570 --> 00:21:23.050
You'll never hear me
in public, for example.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:28.160
So I try to zone in and hone
in on those moments in my mind

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.030 position:56%
and in my emotions while I'm
playing of the most intimate moments

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:37.160
so that it will, I guess level
my comfort zone to try to focus

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.170
on my mission, which is to try

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:42.160
to make you feel what I'm feeling
while I'm playing which is to try

00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:45.490
to make you think about where
I'm taking you through my music

00:21:45.490 --> 00:21:47.600
and why and when and where.

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:52.980
And I feel that it'll resonate more
with your memory and your heart

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:55.210
that you walk away
with an experience

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:57.070
and not just entertainment.

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:03.410
And so when I perform, my
ultimate goal essentially is

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.120
to do just that exactly.

00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:10.420
Just try to resonate my thoughts,
feelings, emotions at that moment.

00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:13.430
And again, I zone into those
intimate moments when I'm

00:22:13.430 --> 00:22:16.920
in my room, for example, my
bedroom either composing a piece

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.010
or just playing something I've
played a thousand times before.

00:22:20.010 --> 00:22:22.860 position:56%
Did I play it differently this time?

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.160
Did you understand it?

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.460
Did you appreciate it?

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:26.760
Why and how?

00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.160
Because those are the type of
moments that resonate with me

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.030
with other cuatro players.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:32.330
I walk away with an experience.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:35.350 position:56%
I remember that more than just being
entertained, just putting on a show.

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:37.850
I can talk to him here
over their playing,

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.150
but you're not doing anything.

00:22:39.150 --> 00:22:40.450
It's just entertainment.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:43.720
But when you have my full
complete focus on you,

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.290
it's because you're doing
something through the instrument

00:22:46.290 --> 00:22:50.070
and so that's what
ultimately my goal is.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:51.370
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do you --

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.700
are those feelings different
when you play in Puerto Rico then

00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:56.610
when you play in New
Jersey or New York or...

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:57.910
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:22:57.910 --> 00:22:59.390
When I have -- I have to admit.

00:22:59.390 --> 00:23:03.230
When we're visiting the island,
it's such a different spirit

00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:06.430
that just comes over us when we're
playing, specifically when we meet

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:11.470
up with other cuatritas or
guitarists that are known for this

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:14.960 position:56%
because you're trying to exactly
emotionally connect with that person

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:18.080
and so when we're back here,
back home in the States,

00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:24.050
we're trying to re-enact that,
if you will, and we try to live

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:29.360
that moment that we had in front of
you here so that you can try to get

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:33.660
that interpretation of what it
is we're doing in Puerto Rico,

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.200
what the music is doing over there.

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.770
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Turning
to the music a bit here.

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:44.340
You mentioned the aguinaldo
genre as the bedrock

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:48.450
of some of things you play here.

00:23:48.450 --> 00:23:51.360
Tell us about some of the
other genres, valse and dansa

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.790
and those kinds of things.

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.340
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: As I said
prior, the dansa is one

00:23:55.340 --> 00:24:01.090
of the most beautiful, beautiful
forms that exists for the cuatro.

00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:05.500 position:56%
My dream is to eventually record an
album where it's nothing but dansas.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.270
One of the most beautiful
things ever heard

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.900
on the Puerto Rican cuatro.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:13.740
It wasn't originally the dansa
particularly wasn't originally

00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.050
created for the cuatro,
by the cuatro.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:21.220 position:56%
It was an orchestra type arrangement
played on piano and horns and such.

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:25.170
But as time went by and the cuatro
started becoming more mainstream

00:24:25.170 --> 00:24:30.850
in the late 1800s and things
like that, early 1900s,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.870
and what Ladi did do it, for
example, I'll go back to that.

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:36.560
The dansa became more
and more and more.

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:39.550
And such -- the same thing
with the valse, the same thing

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:43.250
with the mazurka, the same
thing with the joropo.

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:45.850
Each style is in its own
world but still stands

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.960
out in its own form of class.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.500
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Could you
introduce your colleague

00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:55.970
and maybe give us a taste of
alguinaldo and then a seis or two

00:24:55.970 --> 00:24:58.490
and then maybe a dansa,
whatever you're moved to --

00:24:58.490 --> 00:24:59.790
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:03.290
This is Anibal Ortiz,
our group guitarist.

00:25:03.290 --> 00:25:07.540
We've been playing together for
approximately ten years now.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:11.640
And the moment we started
playing we instantly clicked.

00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.580
Being that Anibal also plays
a little bit of cuatro,

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:16.430
so he's familiar with the style.

00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:20.350
He has that in his ear already,
which he translates to the guitar

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:25.850
and I believe perfect
accompaniment on many instances.

00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:28.090 position:56%
And yeah, we would love to try to go

00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:29.760
through maybe a couple
of different --

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:31.390
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah, just a
little taste, a little sample.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:32.690
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: A couple genres.

00:25:32.690 --> 00:25:34.260
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Gives a
sense of how they're different.

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.560
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:40.280
So here we'll do the alguinaldo
"Auro Que Venyo" [spelling?]

00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.380
and it basically goes like -- which
is like you said earlier is sort

00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:48.440
of a bedrock standard on the
cuatro for the troubadour to sing.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.510
It goes like this.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:26:35.630
[ Music ]

00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:39.430
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Beautiful to hear
musicians who play together a lot.

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:43.170
There's this messaging going on and
it can be very subtle sometimes.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:46.720
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: As I said
earlier, we connect pretty well

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:51.560 position:56%
when we play the music being that we
have such a profound understanding

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.490
of what it's meant to do, not
just how it's supposed to sound,

00:26:55.490 --> 00:26:57.630
but what it's meant to do and so

00:26:57.630 --> 00:27:01.960
that helps the entire
experience basically.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.110
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
that alguinaldo,

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.050
"Auro Que Venyo" [spelling]
identifies

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.770
with a certain town in Puerto Rico?

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:11.070
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Exactly.

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:12.370
Exactly. Yeah.

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:14.990
In Puerto Rico, there's different
genres named after different towns,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:19.300
and I'm assuming because a certain
cuatrita might have created it

00:27:19.300 --> 00:27:22.380
who lives in that town and
named it after the town.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.860
There's a town called
Comerio in Puerto Rico,

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:32.510
and they have a seis
which sounds like this.

00:27:32.510 --> 00:28:09.130
[ Music ]

00:28:09.130 --> 00:28:12.790
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: So that's another
example that seis, particular seis

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:16.380
where the troubadour sings
to came from that town,

00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:20.700
and likewise many other
towns have their own version

00:28:20.700 --> 00:28:24.400
of different alguinaldos and seis,
which are the two predominant.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.950
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What's a seis?

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.050
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: A seis-- all
right, now you're going to get me

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:29.570
into history lesson here.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.070
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: No, not too deep.

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.980
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I know that seis,

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.940
the reason they're called
seis is there's rules

00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:37.240
and regulations to
singing these songs.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.810
It's customary in traditions.

00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.910
It has to be a certain
amount of syllables,

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:43.320
certain words have to rhyme.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.620
Others don't.

00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:48.840
Not everyone can sing --
formally sing this kind of music.

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:53.380
And although I'm not a troubadour
myself, I never really studied,

00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:55.490
but the same thing
applies to the alguinaldo,

00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:56.950
which are the two major genres.

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.740
You have the seis, and then
the alguinaldo also has

00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:04.320
to have its own rules and
regulations where you can only sing

00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.950
on one sentence or one
line a certain amount

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.620
of syllables per word,
per sentence, per line.

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:13.580
And every other sentence has
to rhyme in a certain way.

00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:14.900 position:56%
And a lot of people don't know this.

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.650
There's actual rules
and regulations --

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:21.570
formally singing this
music and playing.

00:29:21.570 --> 00:29:25.380
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do they
still use the term espinela?

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:26.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Exactly, espinela.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.930
That's where the inspiration
comes from

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:33.790
and the concept to sing the sies.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:35.940
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: You play lots of
different kinds of seises, right?

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.740
Seis means six, but it's
kind of a genre that --

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:41.040
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.380
Under each category, there's --

00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:48.650
wow hundreds maybe of seis in
different styles alguinaldos.

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:51.450
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And what
other genres do you play?

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:52.750
We have alguinaldos.

00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:54.050
We have sies....

00:29:54.050 --> 00:29:55.350
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Alguinaldos
and seis.

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:58.770
Then there's the bomba y
plena, which is also typical

00:29:58.770 --> 00:30:02.910
of Puerto Rico, but more of the
African influence in Puerto Rico

00:30:02.910 --> 00:30:06.620
with the conga drums and
everything like that.

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.320
Yeah. The cuatro and guitar were
added on to the bomba y plena

00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.020
for melody and singing to
accompany, but that style of music

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.650
in all genres have
the African influence

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.330
which is something
we're very proud of.

00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:23.370
We enjoy playing bombas and plenas
and stuff and things like that

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:24.670
when we get together as a group.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:28.810
Everyone enjoys -- those
are really upbeat, festive,

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.750
danceable songs or styles.

00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:33.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do you hang with
pleneros in New Jersey and New York?

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.080
There are a lot of
[inaudible] there.

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:38.230
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: We've had the
privilege of performing once

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:40.070
or twice with a couple of groups.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.810 position:56%
But we haven't had the honor of
actually being able to hang and meet

00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:46.250
with someone where we
can sit down and say --

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:49.680
to work on, let's collaborate
on something.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:50.980
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Lots
of potential there.

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.280
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah, exactly.

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.580
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And so what else?

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:54.880
Do you play the dansa?

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.180
You play the mazurka.

00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:57.480
What are some of the other?

00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:59.550
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: There's
also paseo [spelling?].

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:04.320
We can do a paseo.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.840
There's that style.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:08.980
I do -- I'm not going to really say

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:13.260
because I'm not certain what South
American country the paseo has

00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.510
influenced Puerto Rico, but
it has become so popular

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:21.080 position:56%
and also become a standard in styles
of music of the Puerto Rican cuatro,

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:25.460
and there's a cuatro player by the
name of Eddie Lopez in Puerto Rico

00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:27.730
who has also composed
many, many songs; of whom,

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:32.690
which Edwin Colón Zayas has been
influenced -- influenced by.

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.210
And there's a paseo that he plays.

00:31:34.210 --> 00:31:36.760
Eddie Lopez composed many years
ago, and it goes like this

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:38.810
so you can get the
understanding of the rhythm.

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:40.610
It goes.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:32:14.060
[ Music ]

00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.910
So on and so forth.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:18.340
But you get the concept
behind the idea.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.080
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: I see
you get lost in that.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.380
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I do.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.420
But yeah, see the rhythms
change on guitar

00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.820
and so every rhythm is a different
influence from a different country,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:33.750
I would say, that somehow somewhere
or another has become a standard

00:32:33.750 --> 00:32:37.880
for how cuatritas play in Puerto
Rico and how they compose music.

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.790
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So just to
round off the different kinds

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.800
of music valse, you
mentioned a valse.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.100
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Valse.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.850
Yeah, there's a valse that Edwin
Colón Zayas made very popular,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.510
one of his own inspirations
and compositions.

00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:55.050
[ Music ]

00:32:55.050 --> 00:33:00.510
I believe he even named it
after one of his daughters.

00:33:00.510 --> 00:33:43.240
[ Music ]

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.130
So you have that rhythm too
for valse, which is gorgeous.

00:33:46.130 --> 00:33:49.740
I mean, it's such an exquisite
rhythm and style of playing.

00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:51.040
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: It is.

00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.340
What else is there?

00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:55.640
Is there something
marimba [spelling?]?

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.160
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: There is marumba.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:33:59.780
There's chacarar [spelling?].

00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:02.540
Guaracha is one of
our favorite styles.

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:04.220
I mean, that's -- let's do

00:34:04.220 --> 00:34:07.090
"Flamboyan" guaracha will give you
a quick snippet of -guaracha is one

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:08.820
of the most popular
danceable styles,

00:34:08.820 --> 00:34:12.510
and there's a real famous song
made popular many years ago

00:34:12.510 --> 00:34:18.250 position:56%
in Puerto Rico named "El Flamboyan,"
which is beautiful fiery red tree

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:23.340
that exists in Puerto Rico, and it
is -- a certain cuatro player many,

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:29.200
many years ago inspired by that
also composed a fiery song for it,

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:32.810
entitled it after the tree, which
is called the flamboyan tree.

00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:34.610
It goes like this.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:35:08.500
[ Music ]

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:09.800
And so on and so forth.

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:13.120
So, it's a danceable, upbeat
type style known as guaracha .

00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:16.620
That's also popular.

00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:20.550 position:56%
Early 1900s that really took off the
guaracha style and you would hear

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:24.400
that in all dance halls and parties
and people would always dance

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.680
and ask for guaracha
so they could dance.

00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.980
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Beautiful rhythm.

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:31.000
You're tapping your foot.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.300
Tempo....

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.750
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: You can't help
but feel that rhythm, you know?

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.100
That style.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.240
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Now,
you're a composer as well.

00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:43.330 position:56%
What sorts of pieces do you compose?

00:35:43.330 --> 00:35:44.630
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:47.160
I'll be honest with you.

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:52.260
My compositions and
inspirations come very rare.

00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:54.560
I don't sit at home
composing every week.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.930
In the almost 25 years, around
25 years I've been playing,

00:35:58.930 --> 00:36:03.460
I might have composed five
or six songs, if that.

00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.990
But it has to be something
major that takes

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:12.980
over me emotionally obviously
to move me to a musical piece.

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:18.180
And I've had the honor of composing
a dansa, which I performed today;

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:24.100
a mazurka, which I also performed
today; a joropo and so on.

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:31.490
I've even composed a guaracha and a
prelude, because of being inspired

00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:36.070
by the classical movement on the
Puerto Rican cuatro, and so I guess

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:39.670
like any other musician, you get
an inspiration from somewhere.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:43.010
Mine just don't come that
quickly, but when they do,

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:44.960
I try to take advantage
of it and try

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:49.010
to compose the best piece possible
that'll resonate throughout the

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.100
years because I also
understand that it's something

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:52.590
that will last for years.

00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:58.190
I hear songs from the 1940s,
1950s by Ladi, for example,

00:36:58.190 --> 00:37:05.190
and they still feel timeless and
so when I do get an inspiration,

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.530
I try to follow that idea.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.370
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:12.580
You didn't compose and
seises or aquinaldos.

00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:13.880
What's that?

00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:15.360
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I know --
it's funny you mention that.

00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:18.590 position:56%
Being that I was born in the town of
Twetado, [spelling?] in Puerto Rico,

00:37:18.590 --> 00:37:24.590 position:56%
I always wanted to compose some type
of seis, [inaudible] or aguinaldo,

00:37:24.590 --> 00:37:28.170
and I just -- I guess
I'm taking my time

00:37:28.170 --> 00:37:31.330 position:56%
because I don't want to copy anyone.

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:32.930
There's so many out there.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.170
You think you compose something
and someone already did it.

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:37.800
So I'm trying to take my time
with how I'm going to do this

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:40.980 position:56%
so that it'll be my own inspiration.

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.960
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: By the way,
did you ever meet Emilio Rosado,

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.680
the National Heritage Fellow?

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:46.980
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: No I didn't.

00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:48.280
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Craftsman.

00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.580
[Inaudible].

00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.100
Instrument makers.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:53.810
They're just some great
crafts people in Puerto Rico;

00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:57.180
in the United States, as far
as that goes making the cuatro.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.480
Who made yours?

00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:01.580
Who are some of the ones
that you gravitate to?

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.260
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Like you
said, there are so many of them.

00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:07.110
I started basically at the bottom

00:38:07.110 --> 00:38:10.190
with the simple cuatro my father
bought from someone off the street

00:38:10.190 --> 00:38:15.590 position:56%
for $50, and I remember when I
first got inspired at the age of 14,

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:17.890
I said, "Dad, when I turn
15 for my 15th birthday,

00:38:17.890 --> 00:38:20.810
I would like a cuatro
so I can learn."

00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:24.480
And my Dad walked in on my 15th
birthday with a black trash bag,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:28.300
and in it was this
cuatro cracked already

00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.700 position:56%
because of the years weighing on it,
and with that cuatro I learned --

00:38:32.700 --> 00:38:34.870
I don't know who made it or
where it came from, but --

00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:37.460
and to this day, I still have
that cuatro at home, by the way.

00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:41.540 position:56%
I look at that cuatro and I remember
why I started, and so I've come

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:45.110
to learn and meet so many great
luthiers and cuatro makers.

00:38:45.110 --> 00:38:49.770
This one in particular: I was after
this gentleman for several years.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:54.880
His name is -- he's known
as Manuel Feneque Rodriguez.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:01.130
He's from a town called Rincón in
Puerto Rico, which is very far west

00:39:01.130 --> 00:39:03.300
of the island near the beach and --

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:04.880
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Kind
of a corner....

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:06.180
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:07.480
Kind of in a corner.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.780
Exactly.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.080
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Rincón
meaning corner.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.380
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah, exactly.

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.680
Rincón meaning corner.

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.980
Exactly. And so I was after him for
a couple of years and I had to be

00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.350
on a waiting list, I
think, for about three,

00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:19.700
four years to get an
instrument from him.

00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:22.660
I've run through so
many different luthiers.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.320
We're never satisfied.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:28.890
We're always looking for the next
best guitar, next best cuatro.

00:39:28.890 --> 00:39:33.540
You want something of quality,
obviously, to last you many years.

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:37.030
Sometimes it's just preference.

00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:42.650
And so I just felt it was a point
in my life in time where I can go

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:47.200
to the next level and try to
acquire a good quality instrument.

00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:50.970
When I heard from Mr.
Feneque, I contacted him.

00:39:50.970 --> 00:39:52.270
He said, "Well, there's
a waiting list.

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.570
I can put you on it.

00:39:53.570 --> 00:39:55.250
Call me next year, if
I have an opening."

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:59.120
And I kept calling him every year
from that moment on, and it took me

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.060
about four years to
get one from him.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:06.550
He makes great quality instruments,
great quality and great sound.

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.820
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So you
had to wait a year to call

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.120
to get on the waiting list?

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.290
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Every --
I would call him every year.

00:40:12.290 --> 00:40:13.590
He said call me next year.

00:40:13.590 --> 00:40:14.890
If I have an opening,
I'll let you know.

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:16.920
So he called me after like the
third or fourth year and said,

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.250
"Listen, a client backed out.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:19.550
I have a cuatro I made for him.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.530
Now he backed out for
whatever reasons.

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:22.990
If you like the instrument,
it's yours.

00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:24.460
If not, then I'll have
to make one for you.

00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:26.140
I'll send you photos of it."

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:28.520
I wasn't really content
with what I saw I saw,

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:30.220
not because it wasn't
a great instrument.

00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.580 position:56%
I already -- in my mind I envisioned
colors, shapes and what I wanted.

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.470
So I was able to say, hey, this
is what I kind of really wanted.

00:40:37.470 --> 00:40:39.540
He said, "Well, give
me about six months --

00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.150
it takes about six months to do.

00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:44.030
I don't fabricate numbers,
mass fabrication.

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.000
I work on two, maybe
three an entire year."

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.290
That way he puts all his heart
and soul into it in detail.

00:40:49.290 --> 00:40:53.840
And six months turned into a
year, and it was finally done.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:57.200
He took his time, and I was more
than content, more than happy

00:40:57.200 --> 00:40:58.500
when I opened the case and saw it.

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.800
That's another thing.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.180
I don't know what I'm going to get.

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.480
I'm over here.

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:04.210
It's different if I'm over there
with him, and I can say okay,

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:06.080
this is how I want it to look.

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:07.380
I want that wood.

00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:08.680
I want this sound.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:11.070
But I didn't know what I was going
to get until I opened the case.

00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:12.370
And I feel in love with it.

00:41:12.370 --> 00:41:14.040
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Is that
cedar, mahogany or what is that?

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:15.340
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: What's
that -- the back?

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:16.640
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: This side.

00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:17.940
This side, yeah.

00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:19.240
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: The side
-- this is actually rosewood.

00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.540
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Rosewood?

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.840
Okay.

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:23.140
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.440
This is --

00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:25.740
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So
that's your request, right?

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.040
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:28.340
Rosewood -- Brazilian rosewood,
which was aged for 20 years.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.190
And I think an English spruce
top, was aged for ten years.

00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:35.890
And so everything that he does
it's climate controlled wood,

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:38.090
climate controlled
work that he does,

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:41.200
aged so that you get a
good quality instrument.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.480
Not a lot of people are doing that.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:44.980
Yeah, the arm rest also.

00:41:44.980 --> 00:41:46.590
This is a nice little detail.

00:41:46.590 --> 00:41:49.810
Obviously, this concept
comes from classical guitars.

00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:51.650
When people sit down and
play classical guitars,

00:41:51.650 --> 00:41:54.850
they'll place their forearm to
play, which is a proper form

00:41:54.850 --> 00:41:56.840
of interpreting the
classical guitar,

00:41:56.840 --> 00:42:01.060
which is technically not the
same applies to the cuatro.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:03.750
A lot of times when we're
playing, it's up here.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.230
Such a small instrument
to begin with.

00:42:05.230 --> 00:42:06.530
You're up here.

00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:09.690
But sometimes I like to sit down
and interpret my pieces like that.

00:42:09.690 --> 00:42:13.380
So this is something that is
one of his signature things,

00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.370 position:56%
on a cuatro he'll place an arm rest.

00:42:15.370 --> 00:42:16.670
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Interesting.

00:42:16.670 --> 00:42:20.920
So getting back to New Jersey a
little bit: Who do you play for?

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.020
Who's the people in the
audience and what are they doing?

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:24.420
Are they sitting there
listening to you?

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:25.720
Are they dancing?

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.020
What -- tell us about that.

00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.320
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I guess
that depends on what type

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.080
of venue or event it may be.

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:35.200
Predominantly, again, it goes
back to what I was saying earlier.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:39.170
A lot of people love to
hear the festive stuff.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:43.600
People listen to this instrument
and like what you guys head today

00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:45.450
on stage with us performing.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:48.300
A lot of it is just danceable
music and people want us to come

00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:53.030
to a party or graduation or
wedding reception and play.

00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:57.040
It makes me -- now that you
mention it, it makes me go back

00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:03.350
to Ladi's days where if there was a
party, people would ask for dansas.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:05.680
People would ask for
his compositions.

00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.050
That was the danceable music
of that time, the dansas,

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:13.780
the formal type ballroom dancing,
and mazurkas and valses and things.

00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:15.080
Nowadays, it's different.

00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.190
Now with the modern times and all,
this instrument has to try to keep

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.700
up and so with all the different
genres and styles out there,

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:26.140
now we find ourselves playing a
lot of more of the danceable music.

00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.770
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Do you
play any Jimmy Hendrix?

00:43:28.770 --> 00:43:30.950
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: No, actually --

00:43:30.950 --> 00:43:33.570
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What's some
of the wild stuff you might do?

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:34.870
Even for fun?

00:43:34.870 --> 00:43:36.170
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I think
we've experimented with

00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.470
"Hotel California" before.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:38.770
We've even tried to
experiment and delve

00:43:38.770 --> 00:43:40.070
into the Cuban style music also.

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.370
I get some of my influences from
Cuban style music, the Cuban tres,

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.670
which is their folklore guitar.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.250
And I try to adapt some
of that to the cuatro.

00:43:44.250 --> 00:43:47.370
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: So
who are the audiences?

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:50.210
Are they all Boricuas?

00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:52.770
Are they all anybody?

00:43:52.770 --> 00:43:55.890
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: The
majority, yeah.

00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:03.490
Most of the time it is
fellow countrymen and people

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:10.610
from Puerto Rico that just want to
have our music and such like that.

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:15.020
We -- I do have to mention -- I
absolutely love the opportunity

00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:18.390
to perform for not Puerto
Ricans, for other cultures,

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:19.890 position:56%
because it's my opportunity to teach

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:22.670
about the instrument
and things like that.

00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:27.140
This instrument isn't as popular
as some of us think it is.

00:44:27.140 --> 00:44:29.520
You go to certain areas and
countries within Europe,

00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.670
and they've never seen this thing.

00:44:31.670 --> 00:44:34.670
And so I love the chance and
opportunity to say, "hey,

00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:38.120
did you know about this instrument,
where it's from, how it sounds?

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:42.130
" And maybe try to get them to
kind of follow with the sound.

00:44:42.130 --> 00:44:45.670
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Somebody might
say you must be from -- cuatro --

00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:48.420
that must be from Venezuela
or something like that

00:44:48.420 --> 00:44:52.940
because the famous instrument
there, Colombia or whatever.

00:44:52.940 --> 00:44:56.180
What -- so what -- what's
your neighborhood like?

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.560
Are you in a Puerto
Rican neighborhood or --

00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.850
where do you -- what's your -- ?

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.730
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: The city I grew

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.350
up in Trenton is more
of an urban setting.

00:45:05.350 --> 00:45:08.410
There are a lot of minorities.

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:12.420
A lot of -- I noticed the
past ten, fifteen years,

00:45:12.420 --> 00:45:18.220 position:56%
a lot of Puerto Ricans have migrated
out of Trenton to different areas.

00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:23.150
I have the privilege of knowing
two cuatro players that still stay

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:27.420
and live in Trenton so we can
get together from time to time,

00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.300
kind of share inspiration,
ideas and such.

00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:32.140
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: How do
you fit this into your life?

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:37.630
Are there other jealousies
out there that want your time?

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:38.930
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: No.

00:45:38.930 --> 00:45:40.230
Actually, this is it.

00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:41.530
Yeah, this is it....

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:42.830
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: 24, 7?

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:44.970
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I mean, I do have
a full time job, but any moment,

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.290
any breathing moment I can, I'm
sitting down with this thing trying

00:45:48.290 --> 00:45:50.240
to figure out where it's
going to take me next.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:53.120
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: What do
you do in your full time job?

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:54.420
Police officer?

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:56.610
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: I'm actually a
humane law enforcement officer,

00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:57.910
humane police officer.

00:45:57.910 --> 00:46:00.810
So for the past almost 20 years
I investigate animal cruelty.

00:46:00.810 --> 00:46:03.760
That's something that I've
always been passionate about.

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:06.440
That's why I've been here so long.

00:46:06.440 --> 00:46:08.210
It's something that I love doing.

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:12.280
Not anything that I was focusing on
doing, just kind of fell into it,

00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.340
but fell in love with it
and been there ever since.

00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:17.550
It's such a rewarding job.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:23.640
And so it's kind of
strange because I come home

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.960
and then I sit down with this.

00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.450
It's a whole different world.

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:28.810
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Actually,
one of the reasons I asked is

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.050
because I knew someone
who was a police officer,

00:46:31.050 --> 00:46:35.200
and he was a salsa flutist,
and so he would go shut himself

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.780
in his car and practice it.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:39.080
I just wondered if you do the same.

00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:40.380
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah.

00:46:40.380 --> 00:46:44.120
In my earlier years, I would take
my -- one of my lower-end cuatros.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.200
I didn't want to damage my
good ones, but I would take one

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.560
of my cuatros to work with me to
headquarters and just practice

00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:53.570
because I would have -- I
don't read or write music.

00:46:53.570 --> 00:46:56.440
Everything I do is mostly by ear.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.390
And so when I would get one of my
inspirations for my compositions

00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:03.450
for example, I have to sing it
all day so I wouldn't forget

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:06.200
so I would take my cuatro
with me, and I'll play the

00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:09.110
or dansa I'll play the
mazurka over and over and over

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:11.240
so I won't forget it
on my lunch break,

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.560
and until the song is complete,
it would take me several weeks.

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:18.900
Sometimes I will start a
composition, leave it alone,

00:47:18.900 --> 00:47:23.040 position:56%
step back and try to listen to it
from afar and wonder what I'm doing.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:24.340
Is it going in the right direction?

00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.250
Is it going to have the same
inspiration when I'm done?

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:30.940
So on and so forth until
the piece is complete.

00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:32.240
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Yeah.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.780
Those two pieces you played have
a beautiful sentimentality to it,

00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:38.190
an elegance to it, well
thought out kind of feel.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.490
Really nice.

00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.610
Has anyone else ever
played your compositions

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.740
or is it too challenging for them?

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.270
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: My pieces
aren't really that complex.

00:47:47.270 --> 00:47:51.200
I mean, they're -- my pieces
are predominantly simple.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.700
I have heard one or two cuatro
players try to interpret some

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:57.160
of my songs and ask
if they can play them.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.000
And by all means, that's
what it's here for.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.970
I'm not picky or -- but I would
say stingy about my pieces.

00:48:03.970 --> 00:48:08.030
Anyone wants to learn my
songs, more power to them.

00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:10.950
It's there for that reason
so it can keep going.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.600
I want to be able to grow old
and many years later hear one

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.980
of my songs and say I'm
glad that I was able

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.000
to inspire this one
particular person.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.880 position:56%
Maybe that one song was the one song
that person wanted to hear needed

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.040
to hear to get an inspiration to
continue playing and learning.

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:27.740
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: On the
topic of growing old,

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:30.330
we're here in the Library
of Congress.

00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:33.360
And certain institutions
in this town, Washington,

00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:38.480
D.C. think a long time ahead.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:41.600
So we're right now -- this
will be part of the archives.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.640
This is part of the
collections here.

00:48:43.640 --> 00:48:48.060
And I assume it'll be
here for 50, 100, 200,

00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.780
whatever hundreds of
years there might be.

00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.310
What right now -- do
you have anything

00:48:53.310 --> 00:48:57.390
that you think people should know a
hundred years from now or 200 years

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:02.240
from now or whatever about your
music, about you, about the group

00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:05.590
or what part of American
society you are?

00:49:05.590 --> 00:49:07.610
No pressure.

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:10.790 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Not at all, right?

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.090
Not at all.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:13.390
Wow.

00:49:13.390 --> 00:49:14.950
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Even if something
frivolous -- whatever it might be.

00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:19.900 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Yeah, I would want
-- obviously, I would want the music

00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.930
and the culture of
the music to flourish.

00:49:22.930 --> 00:49:28.600
I'm at a point right now in
this time in era and generation

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.080
where the cuatro has grown a lot.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:36.180
It has continued to evolve,
and I'm seeing it grow,

00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:39.750
although in a small community that
it is, I am seeing it growing.

00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:43.460
And I just -- I hope that it
continues and continues to grow.

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.330
It's flourishing very well now,
and I want that to keep on going

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:53.110
and eventually until the cuatro
is basically fully mainstream

00:49:53.110 --> 00:49:57.430
as it would be - as a
guitar is or a piano.

00:49:57.430 --> 00:50:01.960
I want this instrument to
somehow revolutionize the music

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:03.610
of Puerto Rico.

00:50:03.610 --> 00:50:06.090
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, they
say that right now what one

00:50:06.090 --> 00:50:09.250
out of six people who live in
the United States are Latino.

00:50:09.250 --> 00:50:14.940
So as the demography moves
ahead, it could in a way happen

00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:19.610
in a very organic sense combined
with beauty of your music

00:50:19.610 --> 00:50:21.760
and also changing demography
of the United States.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.580
That's the kind of thing
that I think about.

00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:27.830
Who are the Ladis now
for the future?

00:50:27.830 --> 00:50:30.720
Or who are the Lead
Bellys -he was like 1940's,

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:32.890
the Woodie Guthries
from way back then?

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:37.130
Looking ahead now, who are
they right now looking today?

00:50:37.130 --> 00:50:38.430
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Who are they?

00:50:38.430 --> 00:50:39.730
Where are they?

00:50:39.730 --> 00:50:41.030
What are they doing?

00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:42.330
And how will they change
the world as we know it

00:50:42.330 --> 00:50:43.630
when it comes to the cuatro?

00:50:43.630 --> 00:50:44.930
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And that's
why we're interviewing you.

00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:52.120
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: We can only hope
and pray to be just a small ripple

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:55.310
and be able to inspire
other cuatro players.

00:50:55.310 --> 00:50:57.750
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, it takes
all the ripples getting together

00:50:57.750 --> 00:51:00.590
to make things happen,
in my experience.

00:51:00.590 --> 00:51:02.890
Could we round this off?

00:51:02.890 --> 00:51:09.470
I can't resist the temptation
to see if there's a [inaudible]

00:51:09.470 --> 00:51:14.140
in there somewhere because you
were all over that fingerboard.

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:15.730
You're all over that thing.

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:18.940
And that I assume was
all improvised.

00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:22.870
Have some basic ideas that you
kind of remember over and over,

00:51:22.870 --> 00:51:27.420
but that was really played out in
a very special way at that moment.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:31.470
Just so people can go away
with their jaws dropped.

00:51:32.510 --> 00:53:31.700
[ Music ]

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.000
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Bravo.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.300
Well, what can I say?

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.600
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Thank you.

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:37.350
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: Well, as
I'm going to take a page

00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:39.980
from what I heard you
say today in the concert

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:44.990
and say how grateful I am to have
the opportunity to play some part

00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:49.160
in taking your life, your
music, Mr. Ortiz' life and music

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.010
out into the public sometime
now and in the future.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.410
So thanks so much for
being a part of this.

00:53:54.410 --> 00:53:55.710
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Thank
you for having us.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.010
&gt;&gt; Daniel Sheehy: And
congratulations.

00:53:57.010 --> 00:53:59.980
It's a real pleasure
to have you here.

00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.350
So that's it.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:02.650
Thank you.

00:54:02.650 --> 00:54:03.950
&gt;&gt; Gabriel Muñoz: Awesome.

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:06.980

of the Library of Congress.
