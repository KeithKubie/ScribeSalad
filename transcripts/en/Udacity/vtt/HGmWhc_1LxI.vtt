00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.819
What answer did you come up with, David?

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.570
Is two the correct answer?

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.420
&gt;&gt; So
I said that that was the correct answer.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.300
It looks to me like the relationships
at play in frame A and

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.650
frame C are the same.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.400
And the relationships at play in
frame B and frame 2 are the same.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.660
We saw that x was unchanged between
the two frames, just as r is.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.230
Y expanded, just s does.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.220
And z was deleted, just as t is.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.330
Similarly, y was above x,
just as s is above r.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:31.010
So I think it's the right answer.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.330
&gt;&gt; Good David,
that's in fact the correct answer.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.930
Two is the best choice of a level here.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.240
But imagine that for 2 s row,
the match between the representation

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.000
on the left side and the representation
on the right side was only partial.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.360
Just like it was when
we had five over here.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.581
How then would we make a choice
between two and five, David?

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:52.461
&gt;&gt; So it sounds like so

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:56.149
far we've been talking about an
all-or-nothing match of transformations.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.643
But if we didn't have an exact
match between the transformations,

00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:02.584
we'd have to come up with some
way to evaluate how well two

00:01:02.584 --> 00:01:05.230
transformations actually fit together.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.920
So we might say that these
transformations are 95% similar,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.280
while these two are only 70% similar.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.890
So that would allow us to
choose one over the other.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:14.880
&gt;&gt; That sounds fair.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.290
In fact, we'll come across
something like this very soon.
