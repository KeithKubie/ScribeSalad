00:00:14.206 --> 00:00:15.546
&gt;&gt;James: I became Principal

00:00:15.546 --> 00:00:18.976
of Visitacion Valley Middle
School in the Fall of 1999.

00:00:30.046 --> 00:00:34.186
My first day here I heard noise
outside, I looked out my window,

00:00:34.186 --> 00:00:38.136
and there were two students tearing
the gate off the hinges to get

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:40.716
into the yard to play basketball.

00:00:42.236 --> 00:00:45.906
When I got out to the yard, I noticed
there were some young students

00:00:45.906 --> 00:00:47.946
playing cops and robbers.

00:00:48.426 --> 00:00:52.606
I walked up to the young
man, and I said, "Hey,

00:00:52.606 --> 00:00:53.936
can I look at that for a minute?"

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:59.426
And he said, "Sure," and he
handed me his father's .45.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.636
&gt;&gt;James: In the 2002/2003
school year,

00:01:13.016 --> 00:01:16.106
we had 41 murders occur
in this neighborhood.

00:01:16.106 --> 00:01:21.326
And the students at this school,
either were related to the persons

00:01:21.376 --> 00:01:26.856
who did the shooting, who
were shot, or were present

00:01:26.856 --> 00:01:28.416
when the shooting took place.

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:33.016
So there was a tremendous
amount of stress, and anxiety

00:01:33.016 --> 00:01:34.846
and fear for the students.

00:01:36.616 --> 00:01:37.986
&gt;&gt;Laurent: The stress
levels were so high

00:01:37.986 --> 00:01:42.096
that everyone was really
functioning at a disadvantage

00:01:42.096 --> 00:01:43.826
as a result of the environment.

00:01:43.826 --> 00:01:46.566
And it was impacting their
psychological well-being.

00:01:46.676 --> 00:01:51.396
And many of the students actually
have not only ADHD, but PTSD.

00:01:51.396 --> 00:01:57.536
&gt;&gt;Carlos: You take a ride down
any barrio or ghetto in America,

00:01:57.536 --> 00:01:59.106
and you hear the boom boxes.

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:00.116
You hear the shouting.

00:02:00.116 --> 00:02:02.946
And unfortunately, too many
of our kids even hear gunfire.

00:02:05.096 --> 00:02:08.586
&gt;&gt;James: I think that many urban
schools today are run like jails,

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:11.166
because the kids are out of control.

00:02:11.346 --> 00:02:13.796
And that's because of the
environment they live in.

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.056
We're not running a jail here.

00:02:17.256 --> 00:02:18.326
We're running a school.

00:02:19.916 --> 00:02:23.716
&gt;&gt;Laurent: The research is showing
that stress is a major problem

00:02:23.716 --> 00:02:24.976
in our educational system.

00:02:25.176 --> 00:02:27.836
We can't have an effective
educational system

00:02:28.086 --> 00:02:29.896
if we don't address
the problem of stress.

00:02:30.426 --> 00:02:33.646
This impacts our neurophysiological
functioning.

00:02:35.676 --> 00:02:38.636
&gt;&gt;James: In order for kids
to learn and be creative,

00:02:38.696 --> 00:02:40.686
they have to feel happy and safe.

00:02:41.406 --> 00:02:46.606
So I needed to start working on
the social/emotional end of things.

00:02:46.986 --> 00:02:48.926
And I heard about Quiet Time.

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:53.526
And we took a brave step
forward into a new world

00:02:54.036 --> 00:02:56.966
of teaching our students
how to meditate.

00:02:58.076 --> 00:03:00.526
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Head up, eyes closed.

00:03:01.416 --> 00:03:03.146
Quiet Time starts now.

00:04:07.116 --> 00:04:08.706
&gt;&gt;Noah: Quiet Time is the
first activity of the day,

00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:09.826
when the students arrive.

00:04:09.896 --> 00:04:13.596
And it's also the last activity of
the day, before they're dismissed.

00:04:13.706 --> 00:04:16.356
&gt;&gt;Announcement: Please
excuse this interruption.

00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:17.946
Please begin your Quiet Time.

00:04:17.946 --> 00:04:18.306
Thank you.

00:04:18.306 --> 00:04:21.356
&gt;&gt;Noah: The teacher rings a bell, and
that starts the Quiet Time session.

00:04:21.516 --> 00:04:30.196
There's a 12-minute time period from
when the teacher rings the first bell

00:04:30.196 --> 00:04:31.596
until the teacher rings
the second bell.

00:04:32.716 --> 00:04:34.976
It's really completely
silent in the room.

00:04:34.976 --> 00:04:36.026
The students are meditating.

00:04:43.176 --> 00:04:45.936
&gt;&gt;Man: How many people
here meditated?

00:04:45.936 --> 00:04:46.536
Raise your hand.

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:56.316
&gt;&gt;Jocelyn: I'm Jocelyn.

00:04:56.416 --> 00:05:00.746
I am an eighth grader at
Visitacion Valley Middle School.

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:02.666
I live on Sunnydale.

00:05:03.256 --> 00:05:06.576
There was a day where
there were people walking,

00:05:06.576 --> 00:05:08.546
and then my dad heard gunshots.

00:05:08.546 --> 00:05:10.586
Like I felt like I couldn't move.

00:05:11.126 --> 00:05:13.196
The meditation helped me.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:17.326
It was like a force that
blocked what I just experienced.

00:05:23.236 --> 00:05:25.176
&gt;&gt;Rose: We're giving
kids a coping mechanism.

00:05:26.516 --> 00:05:30.296
The problems that you have keep
coming, except your ability

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:31.896
to deal with them changes.

00:05:34.816 --> 00:05:37.796
Behaviorally, you see a difference.

00:05:37.796 --> 00:05:41.986
Especially, I definitely saw a
correlation between their behavior

00:05:41.986 --> 00:05:45.116
and being more manageable in class
after they started meditating.

00:05:48.816 --> 00:05:51.586
&gt;&gt;Carlos: If we continue to do what
we've always done, we're always going

00:05:51.586 --> 00:05:52.906
to get what we always got.

00:05:53.236 --> 00:05:55.806
Is that good enough?

00:05:55.806 --> 00:05:58.326
I don't think it's good
enough for the 21st Century.

00:06:00.806 --> 00:06:03.776
We need to be the outliers
to try things

00:06:03.776 --> 00:06:06.086
that have never been
tried, and see if they work.

00:06:09.606 --> 00:06:12.066
In education, our job
is to touch the future.
