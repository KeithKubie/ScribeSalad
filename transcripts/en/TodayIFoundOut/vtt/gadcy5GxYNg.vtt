00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:12.230
The 
idea of paying for yourself when out with

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.460
friends being referred to as some expression
including the word “Dutch,” seemingly

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.390
incorrectly is often connected to the fact
that for several centuries beginning in the

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.410
17th, the word Dutch had a negative connotation
in English, variously meaning cheap, duplicitous,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.220
alcoholic, poor, treacherous, selfish or just
plain wrong.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.430
The derogatory usage of “Dutch” stems
from animosity between the English and Dutch

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690
due to their competing positions as naval
powers, which would ultimately erupt into

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.800
full on wars, mostly fought at sea.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.511
It’s no surprise then that by the middle
of the 17th century when war broke out, the

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:48.960
English had come up with some choice derogatory
expressions related to their rivals.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.219
Specifically, by 1654, the first derogatory
uses of Dutch began appearing in print, such

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.579
as R. Whitlock’s Zworouia: “The contract
is not (like Dutch Bargains) made in Drinke.”

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.000
Soon, phrases such as Dutch palate (1687 meaning
low class) and Dutch reckoning (1699 meaning

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.450
poor accounting, particularly a bill that
doesn’t include details and potentially

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.590
becomes bigger if you question it) were also
appearing.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.520
That said, contrary to what is often said,
none of this appears to have anything to do

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.450
with the various “Dutch” expressions meaning
to pay for one’s self.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.939
In fact, the origin of this expression might
even have little to do with what we think

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.920
of today as “Dutch” at all.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.090
In the 17th and 18th centuries, many German-speaking
groups immigrated to the United States.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.880
For those that settled in Pennsylvania, they
became known as Pennsylvania Dutch.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.480
As to why these German-speaking people were
called this in the first place, for some time

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.490
in English, High Dutch generally referred
to people from parts of Germany and nearby

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.090
mountainous regions and Low Dutch got applied
to people from the Netherlands, at the time

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.090
with these regions part of the Holy Roman
Empire.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.189
Even after they gained their respective independence,
the naming scheme still stuck around for a

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.590
while in certain places, like America.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.640
In the United States, it would seem that the
Pennsylvania Dutch had a reputation for never

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.030
owing anyone anything to the point that, even
with a group of friends in a tavern, the reputation

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.169
was that each person would pay his own bill.

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.629
Whether this reputation is wholly accurate
or not, in the United States, various phrases

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.159
that included the word “Dutch” became
synonymous with this characteristic and eventually

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:24.390
different variations with the meaning began
to appear in print, including: “Dutch treat”

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.150
(1873), “Dutch lunch” (1897) and “go
Dutch” (1914).

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.409
For instance, the earliest documented instance
of the first of these line of expressions

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:38.340
appeared in the Daily Democrat on June 27,
1873:

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.269
If our temperance friends could institute
what is called the “Dutch treat” into

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.239
our saloons, each man paying his reckoning,
it would be a long step towards reforming

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:48.900
in drinking to excess.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.760
The next up was the “Dutch lunch,” with
the first known instance appearing in the

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.579
Fort Wayne Morning Journal on October 24,
1897,

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:59.559
Perhaps you have a fatter pocketbook than
some of the other fellows.

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:03.019
I, for instance, can’t afford to buy two
tickets every time I go.

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.519
So some of the boys and I go on the “Dutch
lunch” plan: everybody for himself.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.820
Interestingly, at the same time these expressions
were taking on their figurative sense, they

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.670
were also occasionally used literally, as
in describing the food eaten by the Pennsylvania

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:17.670
Dutch.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.589
To wit, an 1894 newspaper report found by
esteemed etymologist Michael Quinion of the

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:27.949
truly phenomenal World Wise Words notes that
a “Dutch supper,” should include rye bread,

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:33.019
cabbage salad, Wienerwursts, and beer “consistently
expressive of [the] vaterland.”

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.980
Given that this line of “Dutch X” expressions
didn’t appear until the late 19th to early

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.180
20th centuries; they first appeared in the
United States, rather than Britain; they seem

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.339
in many cases to be referring to Pennsylvania
Dutch; and they aren’t inherently derogatory,

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:51.250
it’s thought by many etymologists that,
contrary to what is often said, these expressions

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.319
probably had nothing to do with the former
lineup of derogatory “Dutch X” expressions

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:35.889
invented by the British a couple centuries
before.
