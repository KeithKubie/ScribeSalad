in the skeleton project to approach

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090
in the skeleton project to approach
 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.700

something to be rejected and how does

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710
something to be rejected and how does
 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.950
something to be rejected and how does
that actually make us feel to be that

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960
that actually make us feel to be that
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.170
that actually make us feel to be that
that notion to be highlighted is

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180
that notion to be highlighted is
 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.880
that notion to be highlighted is
something that again we're exploring

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890
something that again we're exploring
 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.150
something that again we're exploring
here I'm pretty excited about the class

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160
here I'm pretty excited about the class
 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.550
here I'm pretty excited about the class
it's really not about machine learning

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560
it's really not about machine learning
 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.550
it's really not about machine learning
is more about the art process and what

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560
is more about the art process and what
 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.780
is more about the art process and what
you can get out of it but it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790
you can get out of it but it's
 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:55.800
you can get out of it but it's
interesting the machine learning can

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810
interesting the machine learning can
 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.980
interesting the machine learning can
play a role like a medium like painting

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990
play a role like a medium like painting
 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.220
play a role like a medium like painting
or maybe light plays a role in other art

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.230
or maybe light plays a role in other art
 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:03.720
or maybe light plays a role in other art
this class really helped us think a lot

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730
this class really helped us think a lot
 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:05.480
this class really helped us think a lot
more about the system and how he thinks

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490
more about the system and how he thinks
 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.100
more about the system and how he thinks
we created discrete the values that

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110
we created discrete the values that
 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.160
we created discrete the values that
float in the air

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170

they each are checking with their

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520
they each are checking with their
 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.090
they each are checking with their
neighbors and trying to pull together so

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100
neighbors and trying to pull together so
 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.830
neighbors and trying to pull together so
they're kind of kind of a searching

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840
they're kind of kind of a searching
 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.810
they're kind of kind of a searching
piece and if you come near it you'll

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820
piece and if you come near it you'll
 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.220
piece and if you come near it you'll
disrupt it and they'll all shut off

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230
disrupt it and they'll all shut off
 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.740
disrupt it and they'll all shut off
really keep it still they'll all start

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750
really keep it still they'll all start
 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.410
really keep it still they'll all start
posting them together around you it's a

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420
posting them together around you it's a
 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.320
posting them together around you it's a
very exploratory kind of class because

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330
very exploratory kind of class because
 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.210
very exploratory kind of class because
no one has the final authority that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220
no one has the final authority that
 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.370
no one has the final authority that
learns you know I think what we want

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380
