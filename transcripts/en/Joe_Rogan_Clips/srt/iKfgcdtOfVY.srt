1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,060
The Joe Rogan experience.
My God, I mean it's,

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:09,090
it's a mystery enough to be
born a human being a tool.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,090
Yes. You know, just to be
alive is a, is, is, is,

4
00:00:13,091 --> 00:00:15,100
is an extraordinary mystery,
yes.

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:19,530
To have the ability to love, uh, to, to,

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:24,760
to feel emotions, um, to
understand beauty, to be moved by,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,250
by, by a symphony. All of all of
these things we take for granted,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:31,560
but actually they're deeply mysterious.

9
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:36,510
We don't really know what we are or,
or who we are.

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:41,511
And which is one of the reasons I'm so
fascinated by Rick Strassman's work.

11
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,600
Are you, you presented his
film, Dmt, the spirit molecule,

12
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:49,930
and on my upcoming speaking to her, I'm
going to be doing an event with Rick, uh,

13
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:53,370
on the 14th or 15th of May in Sedona.

14
00:00:53,371 --> 00:00:56,610
I think it will be the first time that
Rick has spoken publicly for quite a

15
00:00:56,611 --> 00:01:00,150
while. Rick has a colleague
called Andrew Gallimore, uh,

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:03,540
who teaches at the University
of Aachen hour, uh, in Japan.

17
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:07,930
And Rick and Andrew have together
developed a, uh, technology, uh,

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,040
for releasing DMT into human volunteers
in a very slow drip that will keep them

19
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:17,310
in the DMT state if they
wish for hours on end.

20
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,520
And,
and the intention,

21
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:25,730
the intention is to use this technology
to explore and map the DMT realm.

22
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:31,890
When do I sign up? Soon as possible.
It's very close. Imperial College,

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,570
it looks like Imperial College London
is going to deploy this technology in

24
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:41,571
further research into DMT and that that
research is not going to be purely and

25
00:01:42,121 --> 00:01:45,870
simply into the therapeutic
potential of a psychedelic,

26
00:01:45,871 --> 00:01:47,580
which is very important research to do.

27
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,140
It's going to be an investigation into
the nature of reality using a psychedelic,

28
00:01:52,141 --> 00:01:54,900
the mysterious nature of reality.
And it is art.

29
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,590
And you know this from personal experience
that when you get plunged into that

30
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,550
DMT realm,

31
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,990
it is so different from the realm
of our daily daily world filled,

32
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,950
filled with geometry,

33
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:09,930
filled with these sprightly intelligences
completely internally coherent.

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,970
How can that be, you know,
generated by the brain, or are,

35
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:17,400
are we dealing with some other level of
reality that we haven't encountered yet?

36
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,440
I think that ancient cultures,

37
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:22,890
and in particular my lost civilization,

38
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:26,850
were deeply involved in exploring
the mysterious nature of reality.
