[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.552 --> 00:00:06.760
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Thank you.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:07.570
Thank you so much.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:08.390
Thank you, Sanders.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.500
And thank you all for coming.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.845
I don't-- you probably--

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.930
I know that other
writers come here.

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.107
And maybe they all
say the same thing.

00:00:16.107 --> 00:00:18.190
I've actually watched a
few of these talks online.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.460
But I often visit
bookstores or libraries

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.520
and talk about my books.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.670
But it's very unusual
to have a daytime event

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.580
and to be essentially
in an office.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.310
And I think even if
someone's like, it's

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.360
7:00 PM on a Tuesday night.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.050
And are they going to-- do
they have the motivation

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.121
to go to a bookstore?

00:00:39.121 --> 00:00:40.870
And I think sometimes
it can be a struggle

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.869
to get out of the house.

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:44.380
But I can only imagine if
you're actually in your office,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.340
on some kind of
deadline or something.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.520
So I appreciate it.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:53.020
I also have one Google story.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:54.970
Which is-- this is
about how I could

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.460
have changed the fate of
either Google or human history.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.890
I graduated from
Stanford in 1997.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.070
And like all intelligent
young people at the time,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.840
I thought that it would be a
very lucrative and stable thing

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.150
to go into the field of
writing, as one you did then.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.840
And I had no idea.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.020
I was an English major.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.750
So I didn't--

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.360
I feel like I sort of
heard of these search

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.250
engines that were popping up.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.170
Yahoo had formed on campus.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.120
And Google had formed on campus.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.790
Although I'm not even
sure of the exact timing

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:40.510
and chronology.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.560
But I worked for the "Stanford
Daily," the student newspaper.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.000
And I was primarily--

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.785
I was an editor and writer
for the Feature section

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:50.410
and the Arts and
Entertainment section.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:56.560
But one evening, in the
spring of 1997, in a pinch,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.910
they needed a copy editor.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.057
So I was reading--

00:01:59.057 --> 00:01:59.890
it was almost like--

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.264
I can't remember
if it was before

00:02:01.264 --> 00:02:03.880
or after the section editor
had read the article.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.610
And I think-- I need
to actually find this.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.470
Because it would be
interesting to go back.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.740
But an undergrad-- I think I
was a senior-- an undergrad had

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650
turned in an article.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.060
And I believe it was
describing this--

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.470
I think that officially--

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.620
I looked this up today-- that
the domain name for Google

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.336
was registered in
September 1997.

00:02:25.336 --> 00:02:26.710
So that hadn't
even happened yet.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.390
So I'm not even sure
what it was being called.

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.580
But there was this article
where it kept saying this search

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.870
engine, this search engine.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.900
And I remember
saying to the writer,

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.750
"I think search engine
is a really weird term.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.470
And I think we should
call it something else."

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.510
And the writer had
to say, "Curtis,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.160
that's what it's called.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.002
That is the--" And I do wonder--

00:02:47.002 --> 00:02:48.460
I still-- there's
a part of me that

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.410
feels like it was
early enough that if I

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.720
had been a little
more aggressive,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.630
I could've changed the name.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.010
And I was trying to think of--

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.495
on the plane coming here today--

00:02:58.495 --> 00:03:00.620
I was like, well, what
should I have changed it to?

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.280
And I don't--
there was nothing--

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:11.470
I was sort of torn between
democracy encourager or Kim

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.950
Kardashian butt depictor.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.900
There's the good and bad
sides of the search engine.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.030
I think that they did
make the right choice.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.350
And it was good that I was
not the decider in that case.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.030
So what I'm going to do today
is talk a little bit about how

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.820
I came to write a book of short
stories, which I believe--

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.350
I don't usually say
this at events--

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.260
I believe there are free
copies in the first few rows

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.610
if you want one.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.690
And then I'll read a tiny
bit to give you a flavor.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.400
And then, if you
have questions, I

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.340
would be happy to
try to answer them.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.560
Including, I assume
that there are probably

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.860
several people in here
who are writing novels

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.990
and/or story collections
of their own.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.000
So we can talk about that.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.210
So one thing that I'm
curious-- because I

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.060
imagine that those
of you who are here

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.190
have different specific jobs.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.000
But raise your hand
if you have heard

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.710
that there's a short story
renaissance going on right now.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.930
All right.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.380
Now all of you have.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.600
Because people-- when I--

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.279
this book came out
just a week ago.

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:20.320
And I've been doing interviews.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.940
And a lot of
journalists are saying,

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.250
why are short stories
having a moment?

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.471
And I can't tell who thinks
they're having a moment and who

00:04:27.471 --> 00:04:27.970
doesn't.

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.386
I mean, that's
sort of subjective.

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:31.234
But I think that right now--

00:04:31.234 --> 00:04:32.650
it is a couple of
things going on.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.680
There are few people
who usually write novels

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.470
who have story collections out.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:38.470
I'm one of those people.

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.791
I've written five novels,
and this is my first story

00:04:40.791 --> 00:04:41.290
collection.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.770
Someone else is Lionel
Shriver has a story collection

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.270
out right now.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.900
Someone named Joseph O'Neill has
a story collection coming out.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.830
And there's definitely
lots of buzzy books.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.830
There's someone named--
I think you say his name

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.030
Jamel Brinkley, who had a
book just come out yesterday

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.829
that's this super
buzzy story collection.

00:05:00.829 --> 00:05:03.370
And then there's also-- there
was a story in "The New Yorker"

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:04.681
in December called Cat Person.

00:05:04.681 --> 00:05:05.180
OK.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.861
One more.

00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:06.860
I won't keep doing this.

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.490
But raise your hand if you
have heard of Cat Person.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.290
That's so interesting.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.940
So this story got
a ton of attention.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:15.670
And I loved it.

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:19.730
It's a wonderful story but
it definitely transcended--

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.320
I have three siblings.

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.000
None of them are writers.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.357
And they all said to me, we
need to talk about Cat Person.

00:05:27.357 --> 00:05:29.690
I don't even think they read
a story in "The New Yorker"

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.240
from one year to the next.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.890
And they all-- we had to process
our emotions about Cat Person

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:37.120
all together.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.730
It kind of-- it's not
about the MeToo movement.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.900
But it kind of touches
on issues from that.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.060
So it was very timely.

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.930
And it had this very striking
photo accompanying it.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.490
But in terms of whether there is
a short story renaissance going

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.070
on, I feel like
great if there is.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.620
I think that people are
always writing short stories.

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:01.280
And sometimes the larger
culture pays attention.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.920
And sometimes it doesn't.

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.770
But people who love
short stories I think

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.040
would maybe push back
against this idea.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.110
But then, at the
same time, it's true.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:18.050
Undeniably, we all have slightly
shrinking attention spans.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.110
Maybe some of you are partially
responsible for that, which

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.700
could be a point of pride.

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.030
Congratulations.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.220
And on the one hand,
I think that if you

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.630
can find the right novel
and absorb yourself into it,

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.930
it's a wonderful
experience, especially now.

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.260
But at the same time,
if you are going to bed.

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.800
And maybe you want to do
something other than look

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.410
at a screen in those
last 20 minutes,

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:49.290
reading a short story can be
this is a wonderful experience.

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:51.920
And it can feel
maybe more manageable

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:55.700
than starting a 700-page
novel or a 400-page novel

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.140
or something like that.

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.870
So the way that I came to
write this story collection

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:05.750
is basically I was one of those
people who from childhood,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.790
from the time that I knew
how to read and write,

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.380
I loved reading stories.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:11.270
I loved writing stories.

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.340
I ended up going
to graduate school

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.690
at the Iowa Writer's Workshop.

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:17.600
I basically jumped
over 20 years.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.040
And I think a lot of times
people think of-- fiction

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:25.790
writers think of stories as
sort of their apprenticeship

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:28.760
while they're learning
to write a novel,

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.342
or moving toward
writing a novel.

00:07:30.342 --> 00:07:32.300
And in some ways, that
was what happened to me,

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.000
in the sense that my first
book came out in 2005.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.200
And at that point, I was
offered additional contracts

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.280
for novels, which I was--

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.270
I love novels.

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:43.110
I was really excited.

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.420
But I got away from
writing stories.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.890
And I think that they're not
really an apprenticeship.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.500
They are their own
beautiful form.

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:54.230
But I personally got
on this other path.

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:56.127
And so I wrote--

00:07:56.127 --> 00:07:56.960
after my first one--

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.730
I wrote four more novels.

00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:00.890
There's maybe a
period of 12 years

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:03.440
where I was writing novels.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.420
And there would
be some situation.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.590
Or I might think of, that could
be a first line for a story.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:11.240
But during those
years, I was busy.

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.980
I had two children.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:14.080
I wrote more novels.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:15.650
I was always on deadline.

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.060
And so I didn't really do it.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:21.750
And then, in the
spring of 2016, I

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.030
had just had a novel come out.

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.060
I had been going around.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.602
I live in St. Louis, Missouri.

00:08:25.602 --> 00:08:27.560
But I had been going
around to different events

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:31.610
in different cities, which was
churning me up a little bit.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:37.669
The normal life of a writer,
at least for me, is very quiet.

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.490
And I'm mostly at
home by myself.

00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:43.580
And it's sort of the opposite
of traveling and interacting

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:44.470
with other humans.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:51.260
And so I thought to re-immerse
myself in writing and in being

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.534
more inwardly focused, instead
of writing another novel--

00:08:55.534 --> 00:08:57.950
either going back to a novel
that was in progress that was

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.230
a huge mess, so it
was off-putting,

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:03.080
or starting a new novel, which
was very daunting in its own

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.710
way--

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.360
I thought, I'm going
to write a short story.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.230
And I had in the last
12 years, a couple times

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.090
I had been commissioned
by editors.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:14.840
Including most recently
an editor at "Esquire"

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.000
had reached out to
me and said, "We

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.790
want you to write a story from
the perspective of Hillary

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:23.090
Clinton on the eve of
her official presidential

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:24.920
nomination at the
Democratic Convention."

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.560
So again, this is in early 2016.

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:28.500
I write the story.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.980
So I had a little hesitation
because I said, "Well,

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.820
what if it ends up that
she's not the frontrunner

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.320
and Bernie Sanders is?"

00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.110
So there was some
confusion and doubt

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:40.970
I had about the 2016 election.

00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:44.120
But it was completely
the wrong confusion.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.340
So I wrote that story.

00:09:45.340 --> 00:09:46.790
Again, came out--
it came out even

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.580
before the actual
convention had occurred.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.740
And something that's
very interesting to me,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.560
as a writer and a reader, is--

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.000
I was in London last week.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.370
And I did an event where
they asked me to read

00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:59.750
a story in its entirety.

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:04.070
And of course, with almost--
maybe like four words in it are

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:05.060
different now--

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.540
it's a completely
different story

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.570
than it was when I wrote it.

00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:14.050
And I feel that as a person,
that if I read a story--

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.780
my favorite writer is the
Canadian writer Alice Munro.

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:19.410
And if I read a story
of hers when I was 20,

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:23.050
and I now read it, I might
have loved it back then.

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:26.560
But now that I've gotten
married or I've had children

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:29.590
or I've just gotten
two decades older,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:33.510
I can see it in a
totally different light.

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.800
So it is an interesting thing.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:37.750
And a couple of these
stories, they're

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:40.430
not exactly about Donald Trump.

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:44.650
But they-- that's the backdrop
for some of the characters

00:10:44.650 --> 00:10:45.460
interacting.

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:50.050
The book starts with a
man and woman interacting

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.150
in the summer of 2015.

00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:57.730
And it's a female professor and
a male airport shuttle driver.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:59.710
And he's a Trump
supporter sharing

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.780
his unsolicited political views.

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:04.480
And she's sort of
impatiently listening.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.880
But then she loses
her driver's license

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.440
and must contact him later.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:12.597
So they end up having
a longer conversation.

00:11:12.597 --> 00:11:13.930
And that's the story that opens.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.960
And then, the story
that closes the book

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.711
is, there's two people who went
to boarding school together

00:11:21.711 --> 00:11:22.210
who--

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.930
25 years ago-- who were in--

00:11:24.930 --> 00:11:27.190
a man and woman are, at
the time a boy and girl,

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:31.160
who ran a student government
election against each other.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.270
And the results
were sort of murky.

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:37.270
And after the 2016 election,
the woman reaches out to the man

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.760
and says, "I'm going to be
in Chicago," where he lives.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.140
"Would you like to have dinner?"

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.789
And he thinks she's coming
to kind of reconcile

00:11:43.789 --> 00:11:44.830
this thing that happened.

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.913
And she actually has a
completely different agenda

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:49.262
that I'll let you discover
for yourself if you'd

00:11:49.262 --> 00:11:50.220
like to read the story.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:56.770
But it's again that issue of
an experience in life can--

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:01.420
the experience can stay the
same or be preserved in amber.

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:05.230
But because we change,
our perspective on it

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:08.710
changes, which is a very,
very interesting thing for me

00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:09.340
to think about.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.600
I feel like, again, in so far
as we're having a short story

00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.990
renaissance, I
think that usually I

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:23.980
don't think it's fiction's
job to capture the zeitgeist

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:27.820
or to be timely or make
political commentary.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.760
That's more like opinion
pieces do that, or essays.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.085
But the reality is that a story
can be written in a few weeks.

00:12:35.085 --> 00:12:36.460
I mean, there are
some people who

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.380
are superhuman who can actually
write a novel in a few weeks.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.840
I'm not one of them.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:44.950
So a story can, I think,
contain the current moment

00:12:44.950 --> 00:12:46.510
more than a novel can.

00:12:46.510 --> 00:12:49.060
And it can also contain
a certain energy.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:51.340
Where a story
hinges on a moment,

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.181
instead of covering a much
longer section of time.

00:12:56.181 --> 00:12:56.680
OK.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.471
I'm just going to--

00:12:57.471 --> 00:12:59.110
I'm going to give
you a little flavor.

00:12:59.110 --> 00:13:01.480
So this is the story--

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.510
the story itself.

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:03.400
It's the second
story in the book.

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.500
And it's called The World
has Many Butterflies.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:09.820
It actually gives
the book its title,

00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:12.520
even though no story
in the whole book

00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:13.540
has that exact title.

00:13:13.540 --> 00:13:16.000
But it becomes, I think,
pretty self-explanatory.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.630
And also, if you
are holding a book,

00:13:18.630 --> 00:13:21.250
there's a few sentences
that I don't read.

00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:23.830
Because I've realized
the hard way,

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:28.480
they're too awkward to say those
sentences into a microphone.

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.670
But you can-- so if you
think, did she skip them?

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:32.320
Yes, I did skip them.

00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:34.120
On purpose.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.660
"Julie and Graham had known
each other for eight years

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:41.140
before they ever played
I'll Think It, You Say It.

00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:43.840
Then they played I'll Think
It, You Say It for a year

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.490
before Julie decided--

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:49.180
decided, realized, idiotically
fabricated the belief

00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.990
that-- she was in
love with Graham.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.610
Graham worked at the same
investment banking firm

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.370
in Houston as Julie's husband.

00:13:57.370 --> 00:13:59.920
Also, their respective
kids all attended

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.450
the same private school, which
meant Julie and Keith saw

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.340
Graham and his wife
Gail regularly,

00:14:06.340 --> 00:14:08.260
in a way that, for
almost a decade

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.720
had barely registered
with Julie.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.270
They showed up at the same
soccer games and school

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:17.220
fundraisers and Christmas
parties and dinner parties.

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.930
They greeted one another
in a friendly fashion.

00:14:19.930 --> 00:14:23.200
And, in retrospect, Julie
went over it repeatedly,

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:27.310
that innocent earlier era
before she became obsessed.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.800
She thought of Graham as
slightly more appealing

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.610
than most men, but neither
fascinating nor smolderingly

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.020
handsome.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:37.510
Even later, Julie
considered Graham and Keith

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.240
comparably attractive,
if your thing was preppy

00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:44.280
middle-aged men, which
hers apparently was.

00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.560
It was Brett and Tracy
Hutchinson's 20th anniversary

00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:50.230
party at River Oaks
Country Club that Graham

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:53.390
appeared beside Julie, and
said for the first time,

00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:54.250
"I'll think it.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.960
You say it."

00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.270
Julie was standing
alone momentarily,

00:14:58.270 --> 00:14:59.920
because the
babysitter had texted

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.560
to ask if her youngest child
was allowed to go to sleep

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.940
with the light on in his room.

00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:08.560
Graham nodded his head once
toward an unofficial receiving

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.410
line that had formed
around the party's hosts.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:12.880
"Well, for starters,"
Julie said,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.950
"I'm surprised they decided
to throw this party.

00:15:14.950 --> 00:15:16.658
Because I was always
under the impression

00:15:16.658 --> 00:15:19.240
Brett and Tracy kind
of hate each other."

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.040
She glanced at
Graham before adding,

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.410
"I assume they're celebrating,
what, a total of three

00:15:23.410 --> 00:15:25.150
happy years together?"

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.610
Graham raised his eyebrows.

00:15:26.610 --> 00:15:27.850
"I'd have estimated one.

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:29.417
But sure, let's round up."

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.000
"And even though
they're both tedious,

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.210
they're tedious in such a
distinctive ways," Julie said.

00:15:34.210 --> 00:15:36.250
"With him, it's like
all roads eventually

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:38.650
lead to a disquisition on
the pleasures of hunting

00:15:38.650 --> 00:15:40.270
white-tailed deer.

00:15:40.270 --> 00:15:41.950
But apart from
being bloodthirsty,

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:44.830
he's really gentle and
has such good manners.

00:15:44.830 --> 00:15:47.650
Whereas with her, all roads
lead to her gifted children.

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:49.690
And she's so
aggressive and braggy.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.220
Literally, she's
probably told me

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:55.280
12 times that Mr. Vaughn said
Fritz is the most talented math

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.340
student he's ever had."

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.930
Julie took a sip
of her champagne

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:01.840
before adding, "To be fair,
Tracy does look great tonight.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.280
Her Spanx must be killing her.

00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.060
But she looks great."

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:05.800
"What are Spanx?"

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.830
Graham asked.

00:16:06.830 --> 00:16:07.580
"Seriously?

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:08.650
They're shapewear."

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.210
Julie made air quotes.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:13.249
"They smooth out your
womanly lumps and bumps."

00:16:13.249 --> 00:16:15.040
"And here I thought
womanly lumps and bumps

00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.660
were one of life's great
gifts," Graham said.

00:16:17.660 --> 00:16:19.150
"Depending on the location."

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:23.680
When Julie and Graham's eyes
met, she said, "Who else?"

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.460
So that's the game they play.

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:28.600
And obviously,
the game is called

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.460
I'll Think It, You Say It.

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:32.320
And a friend of mine--

00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.400
a writer friend named
Emily-- read that story.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.240
And she said, "Well
the interesting thing

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:40.120
is, in some ways Curtis,
that's what you're writing.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.620
That you're writing says the
thing that people are thinking.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.300
But probably wouldn't
express, because it's

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.600
too rude and uncomfortable."

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.790
Which of course I took
as a huge compliment.

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:52.300
And so I thought, you've
given me my title.

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.500
Like I don't-- and to be fair,
she is one of the three people

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.660
to whom the entire story
collection is dedicated.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:03.380
And actually another
one is a friend of mine.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:05.200
And the rest of the
story is fictitious.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.440
But this friend of
mine was at a party.

00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.940
And my friend is very witty.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:13.089
And a man came up to her
and said, "I'll think it.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.440
You say it."

00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:17.770
And they did not proceed to
get emotionally entangled

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:20.390
with each other, as the
characters did in the story.

00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:21.470
But I thought, oh my God.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:23.829
That's such a juicy
premise for a story.

00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:27.040
And I will say, I asked
my friend permission

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.900
if I could steal
it from her life.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:33.130
And when she said yes, I also
dedicated the book to her too.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.680
All right.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:41.980
If you have any questions about
writing, Stanford in 1997,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:47.450
agents, creativity, Cat Person.

00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:48.340
Yes?

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:48.820
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:51.236
You just mentioned that you
showed your friend that story.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:53.117
And you went to the
Iowa Writer's Workshop.

00:17:53.117 --> 00:17:54.700
Do you feel like you
still really work

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:57.860
in a workshop format, where
either chapter by chapter

00:17:57.860 --> 00:17:59.680
or story by story,
you really look

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:02.262
for that feedback from
people that you trust?

00:18:02.262 --> 00:18:03.220
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yes.

00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:04.990
The short answer
is definitely yes.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:08.000
So I don't know if you
all are familiar with MFA

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.970
programs in Creative Writing.

00:18:09.970 --> 00:18:13.791
But essentially the
way that they work is--

00:18:13.791 --> 00:18:14.290
it's funny.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:16.690
Because unlike say,
getting a law degree

00:18:16.690 --> 00:18:21.490
or getting a degree in other,
more scientific fields,

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.640
there's no guarantee that
you're qualified for really

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.430
anything upon graduating.

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.160
But during the
time you're there,

00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.700
you've received
this gift of time.

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:33.280
And you've also, under
ideal circumstances,

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:36.190
you've found other people
who can read your work

00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:41.170
and give you hopefully
honest and helpful feedback.

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:46.630
And the beautiful thing is
to find a kindred spirit

00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:47.890
in writing sensibility.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:50.960
Your writing doesn't really
have to be very similar.

00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:54.430
You just have to-- it's almost
like you and the other person--

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.430
and ideally, it's
a two-way street--

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:59.680
are both trying to help each
other make your writing be

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:02.140
the best version of
what it is, instead

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.030
of trying to change
each other's writing

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.710
and making it conform more
to your own personal taste.

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:13.450
And so the format
of a workshop is

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.370
you turn in a story--
like say, a 20-page story.

00:19:17.370 --> 00:19:18.730
And I'm trying to remember.

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.310
I think we used to turn
them in on a Thursday.

00:19:21.310 --> 00:19:24.580
And then, in the olden
days of the late '90s,

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:26.890
they would get Xeroxed,
put on a shelf,

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.270
people would pick them up.

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:30.550
And then on Tuesday,
you'd be in a class

00:19:30.550 --> 00:19:34.720
sitting around a square
or rectangular table.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.850
And let's say you
had eight classmates.

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.780
They would all-- you
would sit there, silently.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.240
It's considered a violation
of protocol to speak.

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.840
Let alone to try to
defend your story.

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:49.600
And these other eight people
would discuss your story

00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.610
for maybe 40 or 45 minutes.

00:19:52.610 --> 00:19:54.034
And then, they
would turn to you,

00:19:54.034 --> 00:19:55.450
or the professor
would turn to you

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.991
and say, "Do you
have any questions?"

00:19:56.991 --> 00:20:00.910
And probably, in minute
14, you had a lot to say.

00:20:00.910 --> 00:20:04.620
And then, by minute 40,
you had been crushed.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.630
And you just want to
go get under a blanket.

00:20:06.630 --> 00:20:08.040
And then so you say, "No.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.770
Thank you so much for
all your feedback."

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:16.020
And then you probably ignore
what five of the people say.

00:20:16.020 --> 00:20:18.752
And maybe you feel sad and
bitter for a few weeks.

00:20:18.752 --> 00:20:20.460
And then you realize
that the other three

00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:24.237
people had incredibly
wise, insightful feedback.

00:20:24.237 --> 00:20:25.320
And you change your story.

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.444
And it becomes much better.

00:20:26.444 --> 00:20:28.790
And that's what it
is to be a writer.

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:29.290
And so, yes.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:35.550
I feel like I'm kind
of proud, or too

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:38.660
proud to show my writing when
it's in a super messy state.

00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:41.869
Some people might give
you an 80-page manuscript.

00:20:41.869 --> 00:20:43.160
They might give it to a friend.

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.140
And one thing will be like,
this scene will be here.

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:47.735
And I feel like,
write the scene.

00:20:47.735 --> 00:20:50.790
Because it doesn't-- you
can't evaluate something based

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:51.490
on an idea.

00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:53.080
It has to be the execution.

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:59.290
So I'll show a first
draft to my inner circle.

00:20:59.290 --> 00:21:00.570
And there are some people--

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:02.970
I will say occasionally
I'll think,

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.010
I need a straight
man to read this.

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.350
Because there are two
straight male protagonists.

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.070
And there aren't that many
straight men in my life,

00:21:11.070 --> 00:21:12.580
besides the one I'm married to.

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:16.190
So I feel like sometimes
I do have to purposely--

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:20.550
or I one time wrote a novel
that was about a woman born

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.140
in the '40s in Wisconsin.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.510
And so I did have several women
born in the '40s in Wisconsin

00:21:25.510 --> 00:21:27.930
read a rough draft of the novel.

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:31.140
And they could say, "Well,
we didn't grow soybeans back

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.490
in the '50s or whatever.

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:35.670
So I try to foolproof
it like that.

00:21:35.670 --> 00:21:39.930
But for me, it's very
important to get feedback.

00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:41.730
Other questions?

00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:43.230
Comments?

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.230
AUDIENCE: Recently rereading
George Orwell's letters

00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:47.220
and essays and whatnot.

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.210
And he points
out-- this probably

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:49.668
in the '30s or
something like that.

00:21:49.668 --> 00:21:51.900
But he was talking to
people who didn't really

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:57.320
like short stories
because the effort of--

00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.877
the effort of getting into
new characters and whatnot.

00:22:00.877 --> 00:22:02.460
You have to do this
every dozen pages.

00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:05.220
As opposed to investing
once in a book.

00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:08.620
And I suppose the alternative
is some sort of hybrid form,

00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:12.330
like an "Olive Kittridge," which
is a novel in story format.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:13.710
Did you try to link stories?

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.480
Or are they all
really independent?

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.030
CURTIS SITTENFELD: So
the stories in my book

00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:19.846
are independent.

00:22:19.846 --> 00:22:21.720
There's also I guess
the novella, which could

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:23.260
be some kind of a compromise.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.530
But I feel as if my stories
are not literally linked.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.270
But they are
thematically linked.

00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.120
And that was almost a
conscious decision I made.

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.781
Where I one time interviewed
a writer, Antonya Nelson, who

00:22:37.781 --> 00:22:39.030
primarily wrote short stories.

00:22:39.030 --> 00:22:41.500
This was years ago,
at least 15 years ago.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.620
And she said she had
had a professor--

00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:45.180
a writing professor--
who said, "You

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:49.680
don't have to purposely
reveal your obsessions.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.760
They will reveal themselves."

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.910
And I think that's true.

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:55.470
When I was arranging
the stories,

00:22:55.470 --> 00:22:57.430
it was almost like a mixtape.

00:22:57.430 --> 00:22:59.340
For those who remember mixtapes.

00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:02.432
Where I thought, these
stories echo each other.

00:23:02.432 --> 00:23:04.140
And so I do want them
next to each other.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.080
Or these stories
echo each other.

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.788
And I don't want them
next to each other.

00:23:06.788 --> 00:23:08.190
And some of the
themes that arose

00:23:08.190 --> 00:23:13.590
were the passage of
time and the hold

00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:17.020
that high school can have
on you and your identity.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:18.780
And then another
theme was marriage.

00:23:18.780 --> 00:23:21.090
And then another
theme was a woman

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.390
who semi-irrationally
hates another woman

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:27.290
with whom she interacts who
she doesn't know that well.

00:23:27.290 --> 00:23:34.550
There's also fame and social
media and public identity.

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:36.360
And so I did think--

00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.440
sometimes, there will
be a story collection,

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.990
and it's almost
like-- and I feel

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:42.660
like people should do-- writers
should do whatever they want.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:46.170
But it seems like someone
will be almost showing

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:49.120
their range as a writer for the
sake of showing their range.

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:52.650
And it's, this story
is set 200 years ago.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:54.699
And this is science fiction.

00:23:54.699 --> 00:23:55.240
And this is--

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:56.910
And I think that's one approach.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.590
And I went in the
opposite direction.

00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:01.770
Where I don't think if you
read any one of these stories,

00:24:01.770 --> 00:24:04.200
I don't think you would be
surprised if someone said,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.720
"This other story is
by the same author."

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:11.670
They have fixed perspective
or consistent perspective.

00:24:11.670 --> 00:24:12.390
But you're right.

00:24:12.390 --> 00:24:14.520
The thing that you're
saying-- there is-- the truth

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.610
is that I think a lot
of people in publishing,

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:20.190
who tend to be
passionate readers,

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:23.470
they themselves love stories
and love story collections.

00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:27.440
But story collections do tend
to sell a lot less than novels.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.040
And I think it's
often for the reason

00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:34.920
that you're saying, where
somebody feels like, I just

00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.170
got acquainted with who's who.

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:38.170
And I got invested.

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:39.769
And now it's over.

00:24:39.769 --> 00:24:41.310
But at the same
time, I think there's

00:24:41.310 --> 00:24:42.540
a trade-off to everything.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.120
And there can be a
excitement or energy.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:47.550
The truth is, I
think most novels--

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:52.530
if a novel's 300 pages, there's
probably 15 pages here or there

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:54.010
that could have been cut.

00:24:54.010 --> 00:24:54.990
Could have stayed in.

00:24:54.990 --> 00:24:55.530
Who cares?

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:59.592
But in a novel,
there shouldn't be--

00:24:59.592 --> 00:25:01.050
sorry, in a story,
there should not

00:25:01.050 --> 00:25:05.480
be 15 pages that are take them
or leave them, either way.

00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.180
Everything should
feel more central.

00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:09.960
AUDIENCE: One more
related question.

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:14.870
I read the British
magazine "Granta,"

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:18.270
which has a lot of stories,
shorter form stuff.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.240
But then, when I read
the notes at the back,

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.820
I realize that, or I see
that a lot of those quote

00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:24.680
unquote stories are
actually chapters from--

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.640
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Oh, yeah.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.890
AUDIENCE: -- book in progress.

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.320
And so they seem
pretty stand alone.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.450
So do you think of
novels that way?

00:25:32.450 --> 00:25:34.370
That you can extract chapters?

00:25:34.370 --> 00:25:36.400
Are they made out of
the independent pieces?

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:37.608
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Sometimes.

00:25:37.608 --> 00:25:39.410
It probably depends
on the novel.

00:25:39.410 --> 00:25:44.230
And it might depend on how
motivated the editor, who's

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.580
doing the extracting--

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.190
the magazine editor-- is.

00:25:48.190 --> 00:25:53.150
I'll tell you the truth
is-- so for about 20 years,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.800
I submitted, off and
on, I submitted stories

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.810
to "The New Yorker."

00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:59.090
And "The New Yorker" would
always say, "No, thank you.

00:25:59.090 --> 00:26:04.460
And then, in summer of 2016,
they finally said, "Yes.

00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.009
OK.

00:26:05.009 --> 00:26:05.550
We'll take--"

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.904
And it's the first story
in here, Gender Studies.

00:26:07.904 --> 00:26:10.070
And I think that acceptance
encouraged me, actually,

00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:12.390
to keep writing stories.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:14.681
But during the time
that "The New Yorker"--

00:26:14.681 --> 00:26:17.180
during that two decades thing
while "The New Yorker" was not

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.160
accepting work from me--

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.510
my agents had submitted my
novels in their entirety,

00:26:23.510 --> 00:26:26.300
to say, "Would you
like an excerpt?"

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.030
And they would say, "No thanks.

00:26:29.030 --> 00:26:30.380
But best of luck."

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:33.170
So I think that there are--

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:37.070
I remember the novel that just
won the Pulitzer Prize, "Less"

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:41.630
by Andrew Sean Greer,
that was excerpted.

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:45.430
There was a short story
in "The New Yorker."

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:48.920
And actually another one,
"The Idiot" by a woman.

00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.840
I need to learn to
pronounce her name.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.520
It's E-L-I-F. Elif?

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.190
Batuman.

00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:56.930
Do any of you know
how to pronounce that?

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.280
Anyway, she wrote a
book called "The Idiot."

00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:58.850
It's great.

00:26:58.850 --> 00:27:01.447
That too was excerpted
in "The New Yorker."

00:27:01.447 --> 00:27:02.780
And sometimes, I read something.

00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:05.054
And I think it is a short story.

00:27:05.054 --> 00:27:06.470
And then, I find
out it's a novel.

00:27:06.470 --> 00:27:10.280
And sometimes I can tell
that it's a novel that's--

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:15.867
everything is its own animal
and structured differently.

00:27:15.867 --> 00:27:17.950
AUDIENCE: So you'd probably
enjoy "The New Yorker"

00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:19.550
book of rejected cartoons.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:20.530
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Ha.

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.440
Ha.

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:25.970
I am surprised to say I don't
own it and haven't seen it.

00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.716
But I feel like I
would feel a sense of--

00:27:27.716 --> 00:27:29.382
AUDIENCE: The cartoons
seem just as good

00:27:29.382 --> 00:27:30.507
as the accepted ones to me.

00:27:30.507 --> 00:27:32.300
CURTIS SITTENFELD: --kinship.

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:33.884
There's a lot of--

00:27:33.884 --> 00:27:36.050
if you-- I'm sure some of
you read "The New Yorker",

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.160
that back page.

00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:42.130
Sometimes I think, all three
of these are equally hilarious.

00:27:42.130 --> 00:27:45.320
They all deserve to be--

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.240
AUDIENCE: So I read
"Prep" when it came out,

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.407
as I know a couple other
people did as well here.

00:27:50.407 --> 00:27:51.740
And I've always wanted to know--

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:54.680
I went to a boarding
school in Massachusetts.

00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.080
Has it ever been
revealed what the school

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:01.109
you created the fictitiional
school after was?

00:28:01.109 --> 00:28:02.900
CURTIS SITTENFELD: So
my first novel "Prep"

00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:04.490
was set in Massachusetts
boarding school.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.864
Which of course
is a funny thing.

00:28:05.864 --> 00:28:07.280
Again, I live in St. Louis.

00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:12.530
And so I would pretty
much never be asked

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:13.670
that question in St. Louis.

00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:18.180
But now I'm back in the
bosom of the prep school.

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.980
So in real life,
I went to Groton.

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.770
I graduated in 1993.

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.070
And I would say that "Prep"--

00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:28.970
I would say that the novel
is not autobiographical.

00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:33.710
But the school, which is called
Ault, is Groton in the sense

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.210
that-- the biggest
parallels are the campus

00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:39.320
is the Groton campus.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.620
So the buildings and the layout.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.165
And some of the
schedule or rituals.

00:28:44.165 --> 00:28:46.040
Or there's something
called Surprise Holiday.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.206
There's something called
Surprise Holiday at Groton.

00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:51.440
So yeah, I feel like it's not--

00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.350
the things that are described--
and that's, in a way,

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:57.410
to be a writer, I think,
I feel at times like--

00:28:57.410 --> 00:29:01.370
to be a fiction writer that
I'm a bird building a nest.

00:29:01.370 --> 00:29:05.810
And that I'll take things
from wherever I need them.

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:10.490
This thing that my sister
told me 12 years ago.

00:29:10.490 --> 00:29:12.350
And this thing that's
from my imagination.

00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.030
And this thing that I observed.

00:29:14.030 --> 00:29:17.690
And just mix together
somewhat shamelessly.

00:29:17.690 --> 00:29:21.680
Which I think can be unsettling
or confusing to people

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:26.780
who are familiar with any
part of what is realistic.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.650
And so even for my family
to read my fiction--

00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:33.590
I think it's safe to say,
my family is supportive.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.300
And they're not
my ideal audience.

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:36.560
Because they will--

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.220
I wrote a novel
called "Sisterland."

00:29:38.220 --> 00:29:43.220
And at one point,
there's a teenage girl

00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.690
who rides a Greyhound bus
across several states.

00:29:47.690 --> 00:29:52.430
And a man sitting next to her
asks if she'll pierce his ear.

00:29:52.430 --> 00:29:54.565
And it's this total
throw away line.

00:29:54.565 --> 00:29:57.140
And my older sister said,
"Yeah, nice reference

00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:00.860
to when that guy asked me
to pierce his ear in 1989."

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.290
And I thought to myself, oh,
I did steal that from you?

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:05.089
It wasn't even
conscious or deliberate

00:30:05.089 --> 00:30:07.380
or it didn't have-- it wasn't
like I was trying to send

00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:08.670
my sister a secret message.

00:30:08.670 --> 00:30:11.490
It was more like, oh,
what's a colorful thing that

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:14.490
could happen when one
is riding Greyhound?

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.460
So it's not-- I do feel
like I did certainly

00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.891
borrow from Groton, and it
would be ridiculous to pretend

00:30:20.891 --> 00:30:21.390
otherwise.

00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:26.490
But it's not as if I feel like
I have some clear view of what

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:27.500
I think of Groton.

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.240
And this is what I
want to say about it.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.200
Because if I did, I
would write an essay.

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.750
I also will say, there
is, in this collection,

00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.500
there are two stories that
are boarding school adjacent.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:43.220
Or they're almost like
cousins of "Prep," or sequels

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:44.570
to "Prep" sort of.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:48.300
And there's a part of me
that thinks, Curtis, you

00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.000
graduated 25 years ago.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.720
Get over it.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.880
And then there's another
part of me that thinks, oh,

00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.970
but it's so juicy
and interesting.

00:30:53.970 --> 00:30:55.270
Just go with your obsession.

00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.000
So you all can decide
if they feel "Prep"-ish,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.680
those of you who have read it.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:05.100
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering if
since we are in a short story

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:07.440
renaissance, do
you feel that that

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.040
is something that's being
echoed by the publishing houses

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:11.670
as well?

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.540
Or is it still a tough sell to
get publishing houses to invest

00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:17.450
in a short story [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.590
CURTIS SITTENFELD: That
is a great question

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:21.660
that I don't think I
know the answer to.

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:24.720
And I also don't know--

00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:28.110
it probably-- if there is
a short story renaissance--

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:30.400
let's say there are--

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.250
I'm sure the number
is much higher,

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.430
but let's say there are 10
story collections coming out

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.700
from two months ago to
four months from now.

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:43.504
It probably-- I'm sure there are
probably 500 story collections

00:31:43.504 --> 00:31:44.670
coming out during that time.

00:31:44.670 --> 00:31:48.429
It probably depends honestly
in part how they sell.

00:31:48.429 --> 00:31:49.720
Because it's like think about--

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:53.260
I'm sure that some of
you read "Gone Girl."

00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:55.740
In some ways,
"Gone Girl" I think

00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.980
prompted the publication
of some similar books.

00:31:58.980 --> 00:32:01.330
If something is
successful, people

00:32:01.330 --> 00:32:02.860
will think-- people
in publishing

00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.510
will think maybe there's
more of an appetite for this.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.310
I'm not at all
disdainful about--

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:09.930
publishing is a business.

00:32:09.930 --> 00:32:13.140
It's not for hobbyists.

00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.830
Again, it tends to be populated
by people who love to read.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.560
But it'll be
interesting to see that.

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:23.190
I mean, I think, also
again, book clubs

00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:26.460
don't pick story
collections as much to read.

00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:32.640
And book clubs can be really
influential in determining--

00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.780
we can meet back
here in six months

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.390
and assess the situation.

00:32:37.390 --> 00:32:40.110
AUDIENCE: So did you write
them all sequentially?

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.570
Did you have a
plan going into it?

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:46.296
I just read "Fresh Complaint"
by Jeffrey Eugenides.

00:32:46.296 --> 00:32:48.420
That seemed like it was a
hodgepodge of the last 20

00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:49.890
years.

00:32:49.890 --> 00:32:50.840
It was good, but--

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:51.840
CURTIS SITTENFELD: Yeah.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.130
Yeah.

00:32:53.130 --> 00:32:57.480
So what I did,
actually, was after I

00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.680
had assembled enough stories
that I felt like, OK, this

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.360
could be a collection--

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.630
first I had to check
in with my publisher.

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:08.850
Because I wasn't completely
certain that they would

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:10.470
want to publish a collection.

00:33:10.470 --> 00:33:12.480
And I was delighted
when they did.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:17.030
And then, it was actually
a high priority for them.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.861
And it's certainly-- I wish
that my professional problem was

00:33:19.861 --> 00:33:22.110
like, every time I submit a
story to "The New Yorker,"

00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.680
it gets in.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.780
That's not my
professional problem.

00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.930
But my publisher did say, "Stop
submitting to "The New Yorker."

00:33:27.930 --> 00:33:30.090
If we're going to
publish this collection,

00:33:30.090 --> 00:33:32.300
we do not want any
more of the stories

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.365
to already have been
published and be accessible.

00:33:35.365 --> 00:33:37.740
And we want people to feel
like they're getting something

00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:39.720
new and fresh in the book.

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.610
And so half the stories have
never been published anywhere.

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:44.250
And half the stories have been.

00:33:44.250 --> 00:33:46.925
So three of them were
published in the past.

00:33:46.925 --> 00:33:49.190
And then seven of
them I wrote in this--

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:52.420
there was this wave of my
own personal short story

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:53.302
renaissance.

00:33:57.630 --> 00:34:00.600
When I knew that I was
going to have a collection,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.630
I actually printed them all out.

00:34:03.630 --> 00:34:06.240
And put them on the
floor of my office.

00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:11.610
And physically was moving
them around and thinking

00:34:11.610 --> 00:34:14.000
in terms of time in the--

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.739
what time period, what
year is it in the story?

00:34:16.739 --> 00:34:18.460
What themes does it have?

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.130
How old is the protagonist?

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.139
How will these echo each other?

00:34:22.139 --> 00:34:25.513
And the story that I mentioned
that I wrote for "Esquire"

00:34:25.513 --> 00:34:27.179
about Hillary Clinton,
at one point that

00:34:27.179 --> 00:34:28.409
was the starting story.

00:34:28.409 --> 00:34:33.510
But it was really written
almost like, here I

00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:37.201
am in the Wells Fargo about to
give this speech or whatever.

00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:39.659
It was really a first person
thing, from her point of view.

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:41.509
And so it felt different.

00:34:41.509 --> 00:34:43.050
And I think my
publisher felt like it

00:34:43.050 --> 00:34:44.049
felt a little confusing.

00:34:44.049 --> 00:34:46.355
Because as it happens,
I'm writing a novel

00:34:46.355 --> 00:34:51.659
from the perspective of Hillary
Clinton to my own surprise.

00:34:51.659 --> 00:34:54.840
The premise of it is if
Hillary Clinton-- in real life,

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.730
obviously, she went
to Yale Law School.

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:59.240
She met and fell in
love with Bill Clinton.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.200
Well, she was Hillary
Rodham at the time.

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:04.970
And then, also in real life, he
proposed to her multiple times

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:06.510
before she accepted.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.990
And so my premise is,
what if all that happened?

00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:12.100
But she ultimately
declined his proposals

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:16.090
and went on her own way.

00:35:16.090 --> 00:35:18.380
And because if you
are somebody who

00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:24.740
follows writerly gossip,
which I assume you all do,

00:35:24.740 --> 00:35:27.350
that news is out there
that I'm writing this.

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:29.830
And so I think they thought
that, this will be confusing.

00:35:29.830 --> 00:35:34.460
And then that kind of
redistributed things.

00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:37.820
But I don't-- it's hard to say.

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:41.030
It's almost like, I think,
naming a child or something.

00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:44.600
Where sometimes, maybe seven
years later, you'll think,

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.640
should I have given my
child a different name?

00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:49.670
And it's like, should these be
a completely different order?

00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:50.536
Maybe they should.

00:35:50.536 --> 00:35:51.410
Maybe they shouldn't.

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:54.380
But it is what it is
at a certain point.

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:00.050
AUDIENCE: I had a
question actually.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:02.942
So I found it really
interesting that about half

00:36:02.942 --> 00:36:04.400
the short stories
in the collection

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.590
were told in the third
person and about half

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:07.670
were in the first person.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.800
And I was interested
in your thought process

00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:12.549
about when you choose to
write from a first person

00:36:12.549 --> 00:36:14.465
perspective versus a
third person perspective.

00:36:14.465 --> 00:36:16.940
If that's something that you're
very consciously thinking

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.740
about when you start
writing, or if it just

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.180
evolves more naturally?

00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:23.260
CURTIS SITTENFELD: I think it's
much more intuitive, actually.

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:29.000
And I think that very rarely I
have changed it, started in one

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.700
direction and gone in another.

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:34.850
But I think the way I feel
about a lot of creative writing

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:37.280
decisions is that it's
almost like getting

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.360
dressed in the morning.

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:40.790
Where if I said to any of
you, "Why are you wearing

00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:42.470
the shirt that you're wearing?"

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:44.980
And you'd probably say,
"Well, I put it on.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:45.770
And it was fine.

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:46.489
So I kept it on."

00:36:46.489 --> 00:36:48.530
Or you would say, "Well,
I put something else on,

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:49.820
and it felt weird.

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:53.320
Or I noticed it had a stain
on it, and so I changed."

00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:54.220
So it's more like--

00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.900
I mean I definitely
revise a lot.

00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.058
But I think that I just go--

00:36:59.058 --> 00:37:00.516
you have to just,
with writing, you

00:37:00.516 --> 00:37:02.990
have to just try it
and put it down there

00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:06.790
and see how it works.

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:08.810
And then, sometimes
you have to do it

00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.990
that way to see how
not right it is.

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.670
But you can know how to fix it.

00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:17.480
But I think that it is--
one of my favorite comments

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:18.890
about writing
fiction-- so again,

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:20.630
I went to graduate school.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.300
And the director of the Iowa
Writer's Workshop at that point

00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:25.100
was a man named Frank Conroy.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:27.090
And he would say,
"Writing fiction

00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:29.090
is this combination of
knowing what you're doing

00:37:29.090 --> 00:37:30.548
and not knowing
what you're doing."

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:31.317
And I love that.

00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:32.150
Because I do think--

00:37:32.150 --> 00:37:33.110
I mean, it's not like--

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.840
I don't like when people
pretend like fairies

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:38.540
landed on my shoulder
and whispered in my ear.

00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:43.340
But I also think there
is this weird ineffable

00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:45.780
quality to writing fiction.

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.950
And that fiction kind of
synthesizes different elements

00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:54.920
of life that you can't
replicate outside of fiction.

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:57.200
That's what fiction
has to exist.

00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.150
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.500
[APPLAUSE]
