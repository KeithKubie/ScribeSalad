00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.320
All right.

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:09.020
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.250
We're so happy to have you
here, breakout session number 2.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.460
My name is Tamara Brenner.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.757
I'm executive director
at the Derek Bok Center

00:00:16.757 --> 00:00:17.840
for Teaching and Learning.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.750
And we are welcoming
you to our session

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.710
on improving learning by
studying student learning.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.357
And I love the
layout of this room,

00:00:27.357 --> 00:00:29.940
because it makes it really easy
for you to talk to each other.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.060
And we're going to be doing
a fair amount of that.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.640
And so what I want you
to do is actually start

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.225
by talking to a partner.

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:37.850
Why are you here,
meaning specifically,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.933
why did you choose to come
to this session instead

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:42.560
of any of the other
three sessions right now?

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.900
Why are you interested in
spending some time thinking

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.605
about studying student learning?

00:00:46.605 --> 00:00:48.880
So you've got
about four minutes.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.950
Talk to some people
at your table.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.480
All right.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.460
So I'm going to bring you back.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.850
So hopefully everybody now has
met somebody at their table.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.069
I forgot to tell you to
introduce yourselves,

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.545
but hopefully you all
took care of that,

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.200
and you've got some idea
of who you're talking with.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:19.580
So when we're teaching,
we are getting

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.620
a sense of how our
students are learning

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.310
through various
types of assessments

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.440
we might be giving them--

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.490
writing papers, tests.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.350
And yet, it's quite
likely that you still

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.734
have a lot of questions about
your students' learning.

00:01:32.734 --> 00:01:33.650
What are they getting?

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.066
What are they
having trouble with?

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:37.190
What kinds of
misconceptions do they have?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.720
How are they
approaching learning?

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.840
So there's always questions
about student learning.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770
One approach to looking
at how students learn

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.750
and student learning
in our classrooms

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.190
is called the scholarship
of teaching and learning,

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.351
which is often
referred to as SOTL.

00:01:53.351 --> 00:01:58.340
And this is really thinking
about a systematic inquiry

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.129
of student learning
in your own classroom.

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:01.670
And so that's
important, is that this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.030
doesn't have to be done
by some outside expert,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.010
but that you as a
practitioner can actually

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.660
be studying student learning.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.360
And a way to think about it
is that, if you are a faculty

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.730
member and you're doing
research, scholarly research,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:15.860
in your own field, you're
going to be thinking

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.530
about problems and questions.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.280
And you're going to
be thinking about ways

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.740
of collecting evidence, and ways
of interpreting that evidence.

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.927
And you can do the same kind
of thing in your classroom.

00:02:25.927 --> 00:02:28.010
You can be asking questions
about student learning

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.630
and about teaching.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.630
You can be collecting evidence
about student learning.

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.270
And the goal here
is really to improve

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:36.780
the quality of education.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.357
So as the title
is, we're learning

00:02:39.357 --> 00:02:41.690
about student learning for
the sake of improving student

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.590
learning.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220
So what we're going to be
doing in the session today is,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.890
we have two speakers who
are going to talk about some

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.850
of their own experiences
with collecting information

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.660
and evidence about
student learning.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.620
So we have two case studies.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.490
And after that we'll be doing
some individual and group

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.490
work, thinking about how we
might do some of these things

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.000
on our own.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.220
How might we ask
our own questions

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.340
and start collecting
some data ourselves?

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:21.030
So I'm pleased to introduce our
first speaker, Henrike Besche.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.640
She received her
PhD in Biochemistry

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.520
in Germany in 2004,
and since then she

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.460
has been here at Harvard
Medical School in Cell Biology,

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.320
first as a postdoctoral
fellow and then

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.975
as a curriculum fellow.

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:34.350
When she was a
curriculum fellow,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.808
she became involved with medical
education and the Pathways

00:03:36.808 --> 00:03:40.440
curriculum, which is a flipped
discussion-based curriculum

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.430
launched at the
med school in 2015.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.310
She is now working
as associate director

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.807
of curriculum integration.

00:03:48.807 --> 00:03:50.640
She's teaching for three
months of the year,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.223
and the rest of the
time she's focused

00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:54.450
on improving basic
science curriculum

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.090
across the entire four
years of the MD program.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.890
I'm going to turn
it over to her now.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.450
Thanks, Tamara.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.970
I'm actually teaching right
now, so this is my retreat

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.480
for like a day.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.150
But where's the slide advancer?

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.850
So I'm going to give
you one example.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.150
I really love using
data to figure out

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.370
how our teaching is
going, and today there's

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.410
one story I wanted
to share with you.

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.895
So just to briefly
give you some context,

00:04:19.895 --> 00:04:21.269
we're going to
focus on teamwork,

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.910
but I thought it wouldn't make
much sense unless I introduced

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.826
to you a little bit about
what we're currently

00:04:25.826 --> 00:04:27.150
doing at the medical school.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.750
So not very long ago,
teaching at our school

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.700
simply pretty much
looked like this picture

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.900
from the 1940s in
Albany Medical School,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.390
so lectures, lectures,
and more lectures.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.710
And if you went into a
lecture hall recently,

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.164
you would look down, people
were on their screens.

00:04:46.164 --> 00:04:48.330
At least a third of the
students doing other things,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.871
and the other
two-thirds were at home

00:04:49.871 --> 00:04:52.710
sleeping, because they could
watch that thing online later.

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.270
So we realized
there really wasn't

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.125
much of an intellectual
exchange going

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.750
on that would justify
to actually bring

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.730
students and faculty together.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:02.430
So we decided to just
not do that anymore.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.210
But what do you do instead?

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.710
So instead, now we have a
discussion-based curriculum

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:08.550
in these classrooms.

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.680
It's actually a picture
from our classroom.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.320
You can see students
sitting at these tables.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:14.850
You have, on this
image, actually

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:16.530
three faculty
members in the room

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.910
engaging with those students.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.160
So we adopt this pedagogy, CBCL,
or case-based collaborative

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.670
learning.

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.940
And it started in 2015.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.530
So I just wanted to
dissect what that

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.030
means for you a
little more before I

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.160
dive into the teamwork.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.680
So "flipped" means
students study

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.840
before they come to class.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.340
Class is now mandatory for them.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.290
And it's case-based
in the sense that,

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.240
throughout their first
year of medical school,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.210
it becomes increasingly
actually based on patient cases.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.470
But you could also extrapolate
and frame it as problem-based.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.510
So we typically give
them application problems

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.880
that stretch and deepen the
kind of content they were

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.040
exposed to in the prep work.

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.330
And it's collaborative.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.610
Students are working
in tables of four.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.320
So these tables of
four are the teams

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.719
I'm going to refer to
throughout the presentation.

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:05.010
And then it's discussion-based.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.220
So this discussion goes
through an alternating rhythm

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.879
of talking with their team,
talking amongst peers,

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.170
back to discussing with the
larger group with a faculty

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:14.440
member.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.840
So we did this.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.030
We pretty much pulled
the rug out on lectures.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:21.320
And as you can imagine,
implementation wasn't smooth.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.880
Overall, successful,
but we definitely

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.980
had an intense phase of
learning from our students,

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.250
what was working and
what wasn't working.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.850
And initially when we flipped,
workload was a gigantic story.

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:35.070
I mean, all these expert
faculty front-loading

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.470
all their expert
knowledge was pretty much

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:41.210
leading to prep times that were
absolutely not sustainable.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.520
Case-based, it's actually
not easy to decide what makes

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.170
a good classroom discussion.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.330
Things was yes or no
answers are pretty dead

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.540
the moment you ask them.

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.670
So there was a lot of
work that went into that.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:56.040
Not soon into the curriculum,
about a year in, I

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:58.080
started to hear
a lot of students

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:02.100
on the side talking about mixed
experiences in their team.

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.780
So that's what got started what
I'm going to present today.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.970
And then one big
piece of focus right

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.510
now is actually facilitation.

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.080
So we have recently launched
a peer-coaching program

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:16.960
to have faculty actually become
even better facilitators.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.870
So I could talk to any of those.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.890
If anyone's interested, please
let me know after the session.

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:25.380
But today I'm going to focus
on the teamwork, with a focus

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:28.410
on, how do we get the data
to actually figure out

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:30.820
what's going on?

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.330
So again, this is
the CBCL classroom.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:36.210
And I need you to understand
this scheme, which

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.600
is the CBCL classroom, of
which we have four running

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:43.260
at the same time with
around 44 or 43 students

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.880
sitting at 11 tables of four.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.220
So every green square
is one of these tables

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.990
with four students.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.580
Typically one or three faculty.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:53.280
It really depends on the course
or the kind of session you run.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.410
And again, times four.

00:07:55.410 --> 00:08:01.080
So when we started out, faculty
envisioned, this is what it is.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:05.100
Everyone's green,
content, happy, satisfied,

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.270
has a great experience.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.900
In fact, we haven't given
the team part any thought.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.240
Faculty were totally
focused on content delivery.

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.940
Teams, they just
happened to work.

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.860
And anecdotally, I learned
that might not be the case.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:23.460
So in conversations
with students,

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:26.100
I realized some students
had a terrible experience

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:26.680
occasionally.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:28.680
They really were sitting
with people they really

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.590
didn't get along with, and then
they were just sitting it out.

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.809
Or they had a so-so experience.

00:08:33.809 --> 00:08:35.760
They all had great tables.

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:36.850
Don't get me wrong.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:39.630
But they all had
terrible tables, too.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.370
But the more I talked
to people, the less

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.710
I could put a finger on,
well, is this a problem?

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:44.670
How big is the problem?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.019
Am I making the problem up?

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:48.060
And I certainly didn't
want to make a problem up,

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:49.410
and to start bothering faculty.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:51.030
Was this a problem
if it was really

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:54.460
like 5% of the students
occasionally having a problem?

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:56.310
So the question was,
how do we measure this?

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.420
So I looked in the
literature and found

00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:02.640
a nice, 17-item, team-based
performance scale that I just

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.900
ran through the class.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.970
I asked the professor
to collaborate with me,

00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:08.610
and we made it a assignment
in one of the courses

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:11.647
to fill out that survey with
a qualitative piece to it.

00:09:11.647 --> 00:09:13.230
So there wasn't just
this scale that I

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.820
could turn into a
number, there was also

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.278
the question of what's working
in the team you're currently

00:09:17.278 --> 00:09:19.800
working with and what
could be improved.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.340
So I took those data and
was able to piece together

00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:26.550
what I roughly consider
a representative image

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:30.330
of a typical CBCL classroom,
with orange indicating

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:33.930
significantly lesser
of a good experience

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:36.100
than the others
sitting at your table.

00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:37.740
So I'm looking for
a gap in experience.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:40.560
I can't fully judge
it, but there's a gap.

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:42.570
There was a gap in how
these individuals rated

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:43.470
that experience.

00:09:43.470 --> 00:09:45.270
The orange squares
signify people

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:48.210
that had a lower-performing
team experience.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:51.194
And you'd find these asymmetric
tables with one person

00:09:51.194 --> 00:09:53.610
kind of feeling isolated in
the experience, and just said,

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:55.818
this isn't working for me,
but the other three people

00:09:55.818 --> 00:09:57.420
had a reasonably good time.

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.610
You'll see the split
tables with a couple

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.910
of people feeling great, and
the other too often feeling

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.080
excluded.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.230
And then occasionally you'd
see this big orange blob,

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:12.780
which is what I call a toxic
table, with cognitive biases,

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:16.830
emotions running really high,
like really bad stuff happening

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:21.760
that didn't seem
conducive to learning.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.782
So that's where we arrived.

00:10:23.782 --> 00:10:25.740
But then I was really
happy I made the decision

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:28.950
to not just ask about those
quantifiable questions,

00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:31.707
but also ask what was working
and what was not working.

00:10:31.707 --> 00:10:33.540
Because what I needed
to know, what would it

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.850
take to make this better?

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:40.270
So this is what I learned
from reading those comments.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:43.860
So I did a pretty brief,
qualitative type of analysis,

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:45.630
and three big domains
stuck out to me.

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:46.800
It was emotions.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.840
How did you feel in that team?

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.390
It was whether or not that team
had a way of working together

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:54.390
to kind of process, and how they
actually talked to each other,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.010
how they communicated.

00:10:56.010 --> 00:11:00.270
And so in a good team, in a
good classroom experience,

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.994
they felt safe and valued.

00:11:01.994 --> 00:11:03.660
Often they would
actually have a process

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.680
to go around and elicit
everyone's opinion explicitly.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.987
So they were not just
haphazardly talking

00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:10.570
at each other.

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.390
They were systematic about it.

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:14.490
Another big thing is
respecting that everybody

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.960
thinks at a different pace.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.270
So they were actually adamant
about giving each other

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:21.540
that space to think quietly
before starting to talk,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.040
or they would use
different methods.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:26.010
They wouldn't just talk, but
they would draw things out

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.570
on boards and such.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.810
And that kind of
process also seemed

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.540
to help with valuing
everyone's opinion.

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.790
So it's not like they asked
everyone to say something.

00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:39.780
They also valued and truly
listened, didn't interrupt,

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:43.500
and in that process we're able
to emphasize the reasoning

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.080
and push for deeper thinking.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:50.320
So the orange people described
a very different experience.

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.780
So often that orange color
is associated with feeling

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:57.900
outright dismissed and unsafe.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.940
They complained about
side conversations that

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.620
make them feel excluded,
they complained

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.620
about a lack of process.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:06.570
So it was just pure chaos
unfolding at these tables,

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.810
too much focus on
the correct answer.

00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.480
And med students have this
famous expression of the gaana

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.250
mentality, so that
seemed to come out

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.050
in some people at these tables.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:19.020
Answers blurted out without any
consideration of where others

00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.900
were in the thinking process;
lack of discourse reasoning;

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.100
and just not being heard;
some person dominating

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:30.090
at these tables were
common complaints.

00:12:30.090 --> 00:12:32.820
So maybe that's not
surprising, right?

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:34.680
We've all had
experiences of co-workers

00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.020
that we just can't
stand, and meetings that,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:41.100
if we have to sit with that
person, it's just a nightmare.

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:41.670
That's fine.

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.700
People will be people.

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.300
But I did want to know, is there
something we can do about it?

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.996
Because I strongly felt
that, well, maybe we just

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:49.620
need to tell them
how to work together.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.514
Maybe they need to know
that you need a process.

00:12:53.514 --> 00:12:55.930
Maybe that's a thing, and if
we tell them, it gets better.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:57.420
So we're telling them that now.

00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.840
That's not the
question I tested.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.430
We're giving them
the information

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:04.763
that I just showed you, and
feed them forward right now.

00:13:04.763 --> 00:13:06.780
But at that time,
I just said, OK,

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.350
why don't we give them
some time to just talk

00:13:10.350 --> 00:13:13.060
about how it's going, how
they want to work together?

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:14.610
So we gave them the time.

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:16.920
I found another course
to collaborate with,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.520
and they got 20 minutes to,
at the beginning of their team

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.110
work, to talk to each other,
how they want to work together,

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:25.560
and another 20 minutes
a week or so later

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.680
to talk about how it was
going and make adjustments.

00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.720
And that simple act
of giving them time

00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.470
led from what we had
looked at here, which

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:37.800
was the end status of teams
after four weeks of the course

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.650
without any consideration
to the team process,

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:42.600
it turned into this.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.670
So just to make
sure you understand,

00:13:44.670 --> 00:13:45.930
these are different teams.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.780
It's not a controlled
experiment.

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:51.450
But with those additional
two times, 20 minutes,

00:13:51.450 --> 00:13:54.487
they were able to
overall come out

00:13:54.487 --> 00:13:56.820
just simply looking like they
were getting along better.

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.444
And I'm not showing
that here, but it's

00:13:58.444 --> 00:14:02.550
not just that we prevent toxic
teams potentially by this,

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:05.220
but the OK-functioning
teams actually

00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:07.310
became high-functioning
teams, as well.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:08.810
So also, the green
isn't just green.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:12.960
There are shades of green, data
that I'm not presenting here.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.250
So I'm calling this
my intervention group,

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:17.670
but in an experimental
design kind of sense,

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.640
there is no control here.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.756
So to translate that back
to what we're doing at HMS,

00:14:24.756 --> 00:14:26.130
there's more that
went into this,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.960
but it led me to
conclude that what

00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.930
we can do for our CBCL
classrooms is maybe formally

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:32.910
create times for teams
to set norms and give

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:35.100
each other feedback
as just standard part

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.560
of the curriculum.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.897
Now I want to pilot
peer feedback.

00:14:39.897 --> 00:14:41.730
Maybe that's something
we can fold into this

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:43.530
and further enhance
communication,

00:14:43.530 --> 00:14:46.380
interpersonal skill
building, which is something

00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:47.550
that I'd be excited to do.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:50.615
But we'd also give them maybe a
more, bigger context for that.

00:14:50.615 --> 00:14:51.990
Give them a little
more knowledge

00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:55.780
about where this
is all coming from.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.130
So if you thought this is
interesting, that's great.

00:14:59.130 --> 00:15:01.140
I do, too, and I
love this project.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:03.780
But that's actually not
what I wanted to talk about

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.740
with you in a sense.

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:08.250
What I hope you would realize
is that this is actually

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:10.260
an example of how
you can use the mind

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:13.530
frame of continuous
quality improvement

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:15.390
to drive what you
do in the classroom.

00:15:15.390 --> 00:15:19.290
So I've been a scientist for the
better part of my adult life,

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:22.200
and I miss the scientists,
and I'm very data driven.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.400
But I've always been hindered
by hypothesis-driven research,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.610
because it ends you
in a position where

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:31.110
you have to have this control
group, and it's very limiting.

00:15:31.110 --> 00:15:32.834
And doing educational
research in a way

00:15:32.834 --> 00:15:34.500
that you have that
perfect control group

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.810
and you have that
hypothesis, it often just

00:15:36.810 --> 00:15:38.070
doesn't fit into real life.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:40.500
And you can't withhold
entire pieces of instruction

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:42.780
from half of the class,
and then give it to others,

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.250
and then test them
on the same thing.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.910
So what I hope you
can acknowledge

00:15:47.910 --> 00:15:50.190
is that, in this
scenario, we move

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.584
from a curriculum with
lectures and no consideration

00:15:52.584 --> 00:15:54.000
of teamwork, to
something where we

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.050
had active learning
and some teams,

00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:59.040
but no framework, to
collaboration and teamwork

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.740
is actually a program objective
of the medical degree, which

00:16:01.740 --> 00:16:02.760
I found out later.

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.160
So it fits nicely.

00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:06.030
It gives me a lot of leverage.

00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:09.600
So I now aim to make
active skill-building

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.580
and peer feedback
really be an integrated

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.640
part of the curriculum, and
who knows where that leads me.

00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:17.430
So this is the framework of
continuous quality improvement.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:18.480
You're driving change.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:22.109
You're driving that boulder
up the hill, telling people,

00:16:22.109 --> 00:16:23.400
peer feedback is a great thing.

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:24.941
Three years ago
every medical student

00:16:24.941 --> 00:16:27.600
was running away from me if I
mentioned that in the hallway.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.684
And faculty were dismissing
me, saying, oh gosh,

00:16:29.684 --> 00:16:30.850
who wants to deal with that?

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.570
That's going to be
a social nightmare.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:37.800
So you're not only learning
what your students might need,

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.840
you're also educating students
and faculty at the same time.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.150
So there's a dualism.

00:16:43.150 --> 00:16:45.390
So just to compare
this to research,

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.420
so QI is not
hypothesis-driven, it's

00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:51.150
just about how this is going,
how we can make it better.

00:16:51.150 --> 00:16:53.040
And it frees you have
these limitations

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.550
that often research brings in
terms of experimental design.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.430
You can do it in a more
incremental fashion

00:16:59.430 --> 00:17:01.962
that, I drive this in a
kind of yearly rhythm.

00:17:01.962 --> 00:17:03.420
I figure out, what
next piece can I

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.190
work out in the next six
or eight or nine months?

00:17:07.190 --> 00:17:09.730
While research, I think,
has a lot of benefit,

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:13.890
but I've found this
framework really liberating.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:15.869
So this wouldn't be
possible without some

00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:17.440
of the people in the room.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.730
There's the Office of
Educational Quality Improvement

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:23.890
that was just founded at
HMS, which was Amy Sullivan,

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.819
Barbara Cockrill, John
Dalrymple, Carolyn over there,

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:29.670
and Steve ran that office and
have helped me out with this.

00:17:29.670 --> 00:17:32.040
And then Ed Hundert
is our dean, who's

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:35.760
really a champion for
data-driven improvement

00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:38.790
of teaching, and Randall King
is my long term collaborator.

00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:40.108
Thank you.

00:17:40.108 --> 00:17:42.044
[APPLAUSE]

00:17:44.721 --> 00:17:45.220
All right.

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.767
So we have time for
one or two questions.

00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:48.850
Any questions for Henrike?

00:17:51.297 --> 00:17:52.880
I'm just wondering
how you got buy-in.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.470
Because that seems like
a very dramatic change.

00:17:55.470 --> 00:17:59.840
Oh, when we changed
the curriculum?

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.970
I wasn't at the very
initial meetings.

00:18:01.970 --> 00:18:04.070
I was part of a
committee that created

00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:06.960
one of the latter courses
in the curriculum.

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.830
And I think there was an
executive decision being

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:11.770
made at a higher
level that we're

00:18:11.770 --> 00:18:13.790
going to go through with this.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:16.989
And at the time I thought,
this is never going to work.

00:18:16.989 --> 00:18:18.530
They didn't give us
any instructions.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.450
Because they said, we're
going to go flipped,

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.116
do something
discussion-based, but there

00:18:22.116 --> 00:18:23.910
wasn't like, do this kind.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:26.350
There was no information
how we were to do this.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:29.079
In retrospect, I thought
it was ingenious,

00:18:29.079 --> 00:18:30.620
because when the
faculty got together

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:32.616
to get concretely going,
to say, how are we

00:18:32.616 --> 00:18:33.740
going to change our course?

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.110
There was a lot of
deliberation in the room,

00:18:36.110 --> 00:18:39.170
but we still had the freedom to
make it our own in the process.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:42.710
And there was a lot of whining
about letting go, and fear.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.970
But overall, I think some
form of demanding change,

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:51.420
but then giving people
creative freedom, made it work.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:53.165
But as I said, I
wasn't at those,

00:18:53.165 --> 00:18:55.490
when that decision was
made to really go ahead,

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:57.571
I wasn't there for that.

00:18:57.571 --> 00:18:58.070
All right.

00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:59.396
One more question.

00:18:59.396 --> 00:19:01.830
How were the original
groups formed?

00:19:01.830 --> 00:19:04.130
Oh yeah, we just
assigned them, and then

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:07.580
we rotate them and permutate
them throughout the year.

00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:09.660
Did you ever consider
not doing that and--

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:12.010
I would go as far
as considering that,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:15.440
but I think that is too
early in this process.

00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.030
I think we should
have longer teams,

00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.220
and give them more support
to emotionally grow

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:20.360
in those teams.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:23.380
Right now, I think the most
I can ask is for four months.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.090
And I'm making inroads
on longer teams.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:30.440
But I know of one team-based
curriculum at the School of--

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:33.000
its Charlestown, Institute
of Health Professions.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.480
They have a 14-month
TBL curriculum,

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:37.119
and they lock those
in on day one.

00:19:37.119 --> 00:19:38.660
And then they have
a mediator to help

00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:40.760
the teams that run
into conflict they

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.500
can't resolve on their own.

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.000
All right.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.510
Thank you very much, Henrike.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:46.010
All right.

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:47.750
Next up we have David Levari.

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:51.980
He finished his PhD
in Psychology in 2018

00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:53.310
here at Harvard.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.520
He was working with
Daniel Gilbert.

00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.085
He is now a post-doctoral
research associate

00:19:58.085 --> 00:19:59.960
at Harvard Business
School, working primarily

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.550
with Michael Norton.

00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.982
While he was a PhD
student here at Harvard,

00:20:03.982 --> 00:20:05.940
he also worked with the
Bok Center for Teaching

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.750
and Learning as a
department teaching fellow,

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:13.010
and he worked with us as a
co-author on our relatively new

00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.500
online course that's a
collaboration with HarvardX

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:20.110
and GetSmarter on strategies for
online teaching and learning.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.950
Or, not online teaching
and learning-- it's

00:20:21.950 --> 00:20:24.020
an online course on
teaching and learning.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.570
All right, I'll turn
it over to David now.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:29.430
Can everybody hear me?

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:30.102
All right.

00:20:30.102 --> 00:20:32.310
So I'm going to talk about
some of the research I do.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:33.393
I'm a social psychologist.

00:20:33.393 --> 00:20:34.242
I run the studies.

00:20:34.242 --> 00:20:36.450
And the research I'm going
to talk about was actually

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.832
funded by HILT. So if
you think it's neat,

00:20:38.832 --> 00:20:41.040
and you want to do something
like it, or you hate it,

00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:43.450
and you want to do the opposite,
apply for funding from HILT.

00:20:43.450 --> 00:20:44.033
They're great.

00:20:44.033 --> 00:20:47.210
They fund a lot of cool projects
about education and research.

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:48.280
OK.

00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:52.110
So I want to start you off
by talking about some ads you

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:55.200
may have seen, maybe on the
internet or on Facebook,

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.090
for this company
called MasterClass.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.730
Their whole pitch is
that you can learn how

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.140
to do something from the best.

00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:04.410
Pick a topic like cooking,
and you can, for a small fee,

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.750
get video instruction from
luminaries in that field.

00:21:06.750 --> 00:21:08.500
Like here, you could
take a cooking lesson

00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:11.400
from Wolfgang Puck,
a very famous chef.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:14.430
And I just want you to imagine
a hypothetical situation

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:17.389
that I give you the
choice of paying that fee

00:21:17.389 --> 00:21:18.930
to get a cooking
lesson from Wolfgang

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:22.260
Puck or the same cooking
lesson from this guy.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.935
So it's not a hard question.

00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:26.310
And I think the reason it's
not a very difficult question

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.350
to answer is that
we have an intuition

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.702
that in a lot of domains,
all else being equal,

00:21:31.702 --> 00:21:33.160
the better someone
is at something,

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.535
the more they have to teach,
and maybe the more effective

00:21:35.535 --> 00:21:38.086
they'll be at teaching
you how to do that thing.

00:21:38.086 --> 00:21:40.210
And that's kind of what I
want to talk about today.

00:21:40.210 --> 00:21:41.550
What are the limits
of that intuition?

00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:42.450
When is it wrong?

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:45.730
And what are the consequences?

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.910
So a roadmap of some
of the things I'm going

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.470
to try to convince you of--

00:21:49.470 --> 00:21:51.960
we often think that top
performers in a domain

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.120
are going to be the best
instructors in that domain.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.810
But that's often not true.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:59.310
And maybe part of the reason
we think that, even though it's

00:21:59.310 --> 00:22:01.770
not often true, is that
top performers do teach

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.470
in a way that just sounds
very different from how

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.829
other people tend
to give instruction.

00:22:06.829 --> 00:22:08.370
And again, I'm a
social psychologist,

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.639
so the way I do this is,
I take a lot of people

00:22:10.639 --> 00:22:12.180
and I put them in
a situation and see

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:13.530
what decisions they make.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:16.694
So we tried to make a situation
in which we could examine

00:22:16.694 --> 00:22:18.360
how people teach and
learn, and how that

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.130
relates to their performance.

00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.456
So what type of teaching
did I want to study?

00:22:22.456 --> 00:22:24.330
There's a lot of different
types of teaching.

00:22:24.330 --> 00:22:27.285
Because it's easy to implement
in this research design,

00:22:27.285 --> 00:22:29.160
I wanted to look at the
type of teaching that

00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.860
answers the question, how do I
get better at something, right?

00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:32.820
So think of a tutor.

00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.609
Think of a coach.

00:22:33.609 --> 00:22:35.400
Think of peer instruction
in the classroom.

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:37.440
You're asking the
person next to you

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.899
how to do better
on a problem set.

00:22:38.899 --> 00:22:40.440
It's teaching that's
aimed to get you

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.649
more proficient at something.

00:22:41.649 --> 00:22:43.981
And you can think of it as
just teaching that hopefully,

00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:46.530
if it works well, leads to
improvements in performance

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.845
of whatever task you're doing.

00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:51.220
So the way we would study that
is pretty straightforward.

00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.140
We would take a bunch of people.

00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:54.480
We would get their baseline
performance in whatever task

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.639
we're interested in.

00:22:55.639 --> 00:22:57.180
Then we would give
them advice, which

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.010
is just what I'm calling
the type of instructions

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:00.468
we're giving them,
and the teaching

00:23:00.468 --> 00:23:02.100
they get about the task.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:03.930
And then we measure
how they do again later

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:04.894
after that instruction.

00:23:04.894 --> 00:23:06.810
So we're going to see
if the teaching they got

00:23:06.810 --> 00:23:08.400
helped them do
better at the task.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.299
Pretty straightforward, right?

00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:12.090
We used a bunch of
different types of tasks

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:13.540
we were studying this stuff.

00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.660
I'm just going to talk
about one, which is Boggle.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.760
If you don't know about
Boggle, it's a great game.

00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.310
You have a grid of letters, and
you have to find as many words

00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:22.351
as you can in the grid in
a short amount of time.

00:23:22.351 --> 00:23:25.000
So in this grid, here
is the word "ride."

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.462
Here's "kite."

00:23:26.462 --> 00:23:27.420
Here's the word "sour."

00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.650
And you usually
have a time limit.

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.170
So we might give people 60
seconds to find as many words

00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:33.330
as they can.

00:23:33.330 --> 00:23:36.900
And the first thing
we wanted to do

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.340
is basically interrogate that
intuition they started with,

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:40.650
which is saying that,
oh, people think

00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:42.450
the better you are at
something, the better you'll

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:43.410
do at teaching that.

00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:45.993
Maybe people don't think that's
true, at least with this task.

00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:47.350
We wanted to double check.

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:51.060
So what we did is, I took 800
people in an online survey,

00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.800
and I had them play
Boggle, just to get

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.716
a sense of what the game
was like in case they

00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:55.836
hadn't played before.

00:23:55.836 --> 00:23:57.210
And then they
answered a question

00:23:57.210 --> 00:23:59.747
about who they'd want to
be taught by in the game.

00:23:59.747 --> 00:24:01.330
So we asked a bunch
of different ways,

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.090
but one version of the
question basically said,

00:24:03.090 --> 00:24:04.290
if you could pick
someone to teach you

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:06.081
how to play this game
ranging from the very

00:24:06.081 --> 00:24:09.900
worst player to the very best
player, who would you pick?

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.150
On this graph, the
x-axis is the percentile

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.010
of performance people
chose, and the y-axis

00:24:14.010 --> 00:24:15.690
is how often they chose it.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:17.685
And you can see, the
overwhelming preference

00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:21.210
is, people want to be taught
by the very best player they

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:22.272
have access to.

00:24:22.272 --> 00:24:23.730
Another way of
asking the question,

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:25.188
you can split
performance into kind

00:24:25.188 --> 00:24:28.020
of deciles, so the top 10%
of players, the bottom 10%,

00:24:28.020 --> 00:24:29.146
all the ones in the middle.

00:24:29.146 --> 00:24:30.686
And just ask, if
you were going to be

00:24:30.686 --> 00:24:32.190
taught by someone
who was this good,

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:33.360
how helpful would that be?

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:36.090
And you see this pretty
strong linear relationship.

00:24:36.090 --> 00:24:37.840
The better people
are at the game,

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.673
the better other people
predict that they're

00:24:39.673 --> 00:24:41.880
going to teach us how to play.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:44.920
So was that true, at
least for this game?

00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.160
So what we did was, we
got a bunch of teachers.

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:49.260
We got 78 new people
online to play

00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.386
this game a bunch of times.

00:24:50.386 --> 00:24:52.176
And then they wrote
advice about this game.

00:24:52.176 --> 00:24:53.890
Basically, they wrote
a little lesson.

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:54.720
Here's something
I'm going to write

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.580
for someone that's
going to help them learn

00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:58.530
how to be better at the game.

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.027
And then we took
1,500 new people

00:25:00.027 --> 00:25:01.110
and gave them that advice.

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:04.860
Each student got advice
from one teacher.

00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:06.597
And then we had 600
people as a control

00:25:06.597 --> 00:25:07.680
who didn't get any advice.

00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.700
Because we just
wanted to make sure

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.350
that this is the kind of
game where being taught

00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:11.220
helps at all.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:12.678
If it doesn't, then
we're not going

00:25:12.678 --> 00:25:15.089
to be able to learn
anything from our study.

00:25:15.089 --> 00:25:16.630
From the perspective
of the students,

00:25:16.630 --> 00:25:17.850
here's what the
study looked like.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.050
So you'd play the game once.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:20.424
That's your baseline
performance,

00:25:20.424 --> 00:25:21.519
before you get taught.

00:25:21.519 --> 00:25:22.560
Then you get some advice.

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:23.709
That's the teaching.

00:25:23.709 --> 00:25:25.250
And then you play
a bunch more times.

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.570
And the way we measured
your improvement

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:28.010
is, we would just
average together

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:30.110
all of the times you played
after you were taught,

00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:32.360
and then subtract from that
your baseline performance.

00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.990
So that difference
is us measuring,

00:25:33.990 --> 00:25:35.990
did the teaching have any
impact on how well you

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.656
did at the game?

00:25:36.656 --> 00:25:39.491
In other words, was
the teaching effective?

00:25:39.491 --> 00:25:41.240
I won't really go
through this, but people

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.406
gave really diverse types
of advice about the game--

00:25:43.406 --> 00:25:46.380
think small, all the
words are worth one point,

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.920
don't focus on long
words, use plurals, look

00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:51.302
at the whole puzzle,
don't go letter by letter.

00:25:51.302 --> 00:25:53.510
There were a lot of different
strategies people used.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:55.807
It was really diverse
types of strategies people

00:25:55.807 --> 00:25:56.390
used to teach.

00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.973
It wasn't the type
of task where there

00:25:57.973 --> 00:26:00.739
was just one secret to
success, which is, I think,

00:26:00.739 --> 00:26:02.030
how real learning works, right?

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:05.641
There's not just one
way to do a lesson plan.

00:26:05.641 --> 00:26:06.140
OK.

00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.760
So first, I'm not really
going to go through this.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.370
But we did double
check that, yes,

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:12.994
getting taught in this game was
better than not getting taught.

00:26:12.994 --> 00:26:15.774
So the blue bar, people who got
taught how to play the game,

00:26:15.774 --> 00:26:17.190
did better than
people who didn't.

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.745
So this was the type of task
where being taught helped,

00:26:19.745 --> 00:26:21.240
which is good.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.990
Then this next graph
I'm going to show you

00:26:22.990 --> 00:26:23.880
is the important one.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.850
So the x-axis here
is, how skilled

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:27.560
your teacher was at the game.

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.470
And the y-axis is, how much
better you did at the game

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.326
after you were taught.

00:26:32.326 --> 00:26:34.700
And it's kind of hard to parse
out this big scatter plot,

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:36.816
but I'll draw a
helpful line for it.

00:26:36.816 --> 00:26:39.660
And what you see is basically
that, at least in this game,

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:41.660
there was no relationship
between how skilled

00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.345
your teacher was at
playing this game

00:26:43.345 --> 00:26:45.470
and how helpful their
teaching was for you to learn

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.770
how to play the game better.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.102
In other words, if
you were a student,

00:26:49.102 --> 00:26:50.810
and you were trying
to pick an instructor

00:26:50.810 --> 00:26:52.420
to help you play
this game, you would

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.600
have been as well
off, on average,

00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:55.220
picking the very worst
player to teach you

00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:56.219
as the very best player.

00:26:56.219 --> 00:26:59.700
It wouldn't have made a
difference in your performance.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.600
And so it's not just about
the actual relationship

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:06.170
between performance and
teaching in this case.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:08.690
People also predicted that
it would turn out this way.

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.180
So the teachers when you asked
them-- the red line here--

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.010
how helpful is your
teaching going to be?

00:27:13.010 --> 00:27:15.050
The better the teachers
were on the x-axis

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.910
at playing this game,
the more helpful

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.260
they thought that their
advice was going to be,

00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:19.880
the better teachers they
thought they would be.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.055
They were more confident.

00:27:21.055 --> 00:27:22.430
And same thing
with the students.

00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.465
After they got their
lesson, we asked them, hey,

00:27:25.465 --> 00:27:27.590
how much was it helpful to
get that advice that you

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.930
got from one of the previous
players in the game?

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:30.920
And what you see
is, whether they

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.294
were answering the question,
how helpful was the teacher,

00:27:33.294 --> 00:27:34.820
or how much did I
improve, the more

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:37.430
skilled that their teacher was,
the more that these students

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:38.600
felt like they improved.

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.190
Even though, again,
the graph I showed

00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.440
you earlier showed there
wasn't actually a relationship.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.000
So both the teachers
and the students

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.374
thought that better performers
were doing better teaching

00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:49.260
here, even though that
didn't seem to be the case.

00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:52.280
So, at least in this task,
actual advice efficacy,

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:53.990
teaching performance,
wasn't correlated

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:56.120
with performance in this game.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.922
But both the teachers and
the students thought it was.

00:27:58.922 --> 00:28:01.130
So I don't really have a
lot of time to go into this,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.350
but our initial
investigation seemed

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.960
to suggest that the biggest
difference we can find

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.585
between the way that
the top performers teach

00:28:08.585 --> 00:28:10.460
and the bottom performers
in this game teach,

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.530
the difference
between their advice,

00:28:12.530 --> 00:28:14.806
is that better performers
just give a lot more of it.

00:28:14.806 --> 00:28:16.430
So somebody who's
very bad at this game

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.320
might give you like two
tips on how to do better,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.070
and someone who's great
might give you 10.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.680
And people read the 10 tips and
go, wow, this is so helpful.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.513
But they don't do any
better than the people

00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:26.810
who just got two.

00:28:26.810 --> 00:28:27.470
OK.

00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.790
I already went through
these takeaways.

00:28:30.790 --> 00:28:32.540
Some consequences of
what I just told you,

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.190
at least, what I think.

00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.580
So one suggestion, if this
extends to actual classroom

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.110
stuff, is that we
might sometimes

00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:41.902
be overvaluing top-performers
as teachers, right?

00:28:41.902 --> 00:28:43.610
A lot of times I think
that the heuristic

00:28:43.610 --> 00:28:46.190
that students and people
making hiring decisions

00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:48.190
use to choose teachers
is, is this person really

00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:49.648
good at the thing
they're teaching?

00:28:49.648 --> 00:28:51.680
And this suggests, not
that they're bad at it--

00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:53.927
I think, if anything, our
society has way too much

00:28:53.927 --> 00:28:55.760
devaluing of experts
these days in general--

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:58.790
but that we might be
undervaluing the teaching

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:01.640
ability of people who aren't
at the very pinnacle of doing

00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.650
the thing that they're teaching.

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.200
And that is partly a problem
because we don't always

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.630
have efficient matching
between students and teachers.

00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:11.910
Good teachers are in
short supply, high demand.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:14.900
So if there's this wellspring
of great instructors

00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.591
who are being overlooked
because they don't have the best

00:29:17.591 --> 00:29:20.090
grades or the best scorers or
the best track record of doing

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:22.381
the thing they're teaching,
we should take another look

00:29:22.381 --> 00:29:22.947
at that.

00:29:22.947 --> 00:29:24.530
And I think it's
important to remember

00:29:24.530 --> 00:29:27.830
that, just like playing Boggle
is a skill, being a surgeon

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:30.860
is a skill, being an athlete is
a skill, teaching is a skill.

00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:33.950
And it would be kind of
ridiculous to expect somebody

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.600
who's a world-class
tennis player

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.160
to also be a classical pianist.

00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.930
And in the same
way, why should you

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.670
expect that the very
best teachers that

00:29:40.670 --> 00:29:42.806
are out there waiting
for you to find them also

00:29:42.806 --> 00:29:44.180
have to be the
very best at doing

00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:47.216
the things they're teaching?

00:29:47.216 --> 00:29:48.590
I'll just zoom
out for one second

00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:52.054
and say that I think of this
as one example of a broader

00:29:52.054 --> 00:29:53.720
phenomenon in psychology
research called

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.595
"the curse of knowledge,"
which is just about

00:29:55.595 --> 00:29:58.730
how, when you know something,
it's difficult to put yourself

00:29:58.730 --> 00:30:02.147
in the perspective of people
who don't know that thing.

00:30:02.147 --> 00:30:03.980
One example that people
use in studies a lot

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:06.080
is, if I tap a song
on the table that I'm

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.960
thinking of in my head, I
know exactly what the song is,

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:11.000
and it seems obvious to
me, but you might have

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.321
no idea what that song was.

00:30:12.321 --> 00:30:13.820
That was "The Star
Spangled Banner."

00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.880
And thinking of ways to
implement this principle

00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:22.790
in the classroom, a professor in
the psychology department I've

00:30:22.790 --> 00:30:25.100
taught with, Fiery Cushman,
has a great technique

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:27.420
he's used called a
mirroring exercise.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:29.904
Some of you may have heard of
it, where basically, students

00:30:29.904 --> 00:30:31.320
take samples of
their own writing,

00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:33.450
like if they're working
on a draft of an essay,

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:35.312
and they just read it
aloud to a partner.

00:30:35.312 --> 00:30:37.770
And their partner, all they
can do is just regurgitate back

00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:39.740
exactly what they've
heard, and summarize it--

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:41.400
this is what you've
just read to me.

00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:43.710
And you'd be amazed at how
much these students think,

00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:45.630
the ideas are so crystal
clear in my head,

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.880
and as soon as they have to
just read them on the page

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.220
to someone else,
they realize how far

00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.830
they have to go to bridge
the gap between their mind

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.510
and other students' minds.

00:30:54.510 --> 00:30:56.969
So hopefully you can think
about how that principle applies

00:30:56.969 --> 00:30:58.593
to your own teaching,
and how you think

00:30:58.593 --> 00:30:59.970
about teaching in general.

00:30:59.970 --> 00:31:01.200
And thank you very much.

00:31:06.219 --> 00:31:08.010
All right, a couple of
questions for David.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:13.380
Yes.

00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:16.290
My intuition is that, as
much as this makes sense,

00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:19.350
I wonder how it applies in
the teaching and learning

00:31:19.350 --> 00:31:21.330
space of how we teach teachers.

00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:25.350
Because my intuition is that
people are bad at teaching--

00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:27.840
well, that you have
to be good at teaching

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.730
to be good at teaching
people how to teach.

00:31:33.910 --> 00:31:35.890
Do you have
intuitions about that?

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:38.340
So my intuition, again,
matches exactly what everybody

00:31:38.340 --> 00:31:40.548
predicted in the study, and
what you're articulating,

00:31:40.548 --> 00:31:42.810
which is that,
yes, somebody who--

00:31:42.810 --> 00:31:45.300
unless somebody is a rock
star in the classroom,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:46.800
and either has a
ton of experience

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.440
or a natural ability to
engage their students

00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.880
and get the most
out of them, how

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:53.080
can they teach me how to
improve my own teaching?

00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.260
And yet, I will say
that I was involved

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.750
in pedagogy instruction in
the psychology department,

00:31:57.750 --> 00:32:00.859
and oftentimes what
that is, is it's

00:32:00.859 --> 00:32:03.150
a bunch of graduate students
giving each other feedback

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:04.460
and workshopping
their own teaching.

00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:06.209
They're often teachers
for the first time.

00:32:06.209 --> 00:32:08.096
We also have faculty
come in who are teachers

00:32:08.096 --> 00:32:10.470
with years of experience, some
of them very popular, some

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:13.530
of them less popular, giving
feedback and suggestions.

00:32:13.530 --> 00:32:16.020
And a lot of the most
valuable feedback I would see

00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.180
didn't come from the
people I would consider

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:20.010
the best teachers there were.

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.920
So it's certainly-- I don't want
your takeaway from this to be

00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:25.051
that good teachers don't--

00:32:25.051 --> 00:32:27.300
or people who are good at
doing things, whether that's

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.633
teaching or something else,
don't teach that thing well,

00:32:29.633 --> 00:32:32.130
but that the other people
might surprise you.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:34.392
So we should solicit
feedback, for example,

00:32:34.392 --> 00:32:36.600
about teaching, not just
from the rock-star teachers,

00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.250
but from everybody else, too.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:40.290
And just as a suggestion,
maybe one reason

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:42.510
is that people who have,
for example, been really

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:43.740
successful teachers
their whole life

00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:45.870
might not be as familiar
with some of the challenges

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:47.310
and struggles you can
have in a classroom

00:32:47.310 --> 00:32:48.780
if you're less
confident teacher.

00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:51.321
Whereas someone who's had a lot
of trouble, they can be like,

00:32:51.321 --> 00:32:52.950
you know, I also
froze up when I had

00:32:52.950 --> 00:32:54.824
to speak in front of
people, or I never quite

00:32:54.824 --> 00:32:56.436
knew how to manage
that discussion.

00:32:56.436 --> 00:32:58.560
They're tapping into
different realms of knowledge.

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.570
And maybe that's part of
why they can sometimes

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.340
be more effective
than we expect,

00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:06.322
at least that's
what this suggests.

00:33:06.322 --> 00:33:08.030
So I'm interested in
this notion that you

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:12.980
can't expect a top tennis player
to also be a concert pianist.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:19.520
And so one might then apply that
to an R1 research institution,

00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.460
saying that we might have
research faculty and teaching

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.530
faculty, which is a somewhat
controversial idea around here.

00:33:25.530 --> 00:33:27.470
What are your thoughts on--

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.150
do you think that's
a leap too far,

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:32.030
or are you nudging
in that direction?

00:33:32.030 --> 00:33:34.350
I think that it depends
on what your goals are.

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:41.390
So if your goals are to have a
curriculum and program in which

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:44.450
you're giving the students
the best possible experience,

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:46.190
then that would argue
strongly in favor

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.390
of what you're
suggesting, at least

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.306
that's where my research
leads me to conclude.

00:33:49.306 --> 00:33:50.810
And that you want to--

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:53.300
you can't have it both ways,
and try to slice the pie

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.040
and find the people who are
the top, top researchers

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:57.332
and the top, top teachers
without sacrificing something

00:33:57.332 --> 00:33:58.123
in both directions.

00:33:58.123 --> 00:33:59.840
There just aren't
enough people out there

00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:00.866
who are amazing at both.

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:02.240
And you're kind
of leaving people

00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.600
by the wayside who are good
at one but not the other.

00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.100
That being said, it seems like
the students and the teachers

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.810
all were very happy
with their experience

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:11.969
when they were taught
by the great professors

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:12.870
in our studies.

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.929
So unless you're in
a situation, I think,

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:19.130
where you can really clearly
measure the learning outcomes

00:34:19.130 --> 00:34:21.570
and then compare that to how
it would be if you changed up

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:25.550
the teaching staff, I think
it's hard to make the argument

00:34:25.550 --> 00:34:27.190
for a dramatic change.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:29.690
It's just hard to measure these
things in a higher education

00:34:29.690 --> 00:34:30.190
setting.

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:33.620
But yeah, I think,
even short of that,

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:37.670
I think any ways to
bring more and focus more

00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:41.719
on great teaching in an
R1 institution can only

00:34:41.719 --> 00:34:44.250
be for the better.

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:44.750
All right.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.510
One more question, and
then we'll move on.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:47.259
I have a question.

00:34:47.259 --> 00:34:53.449
So if I'm a Boggle player
in the second-best Boggle,

00:34:53.449 --> 00:34:55.174
might it be, does
your research show,

00:34:55.174 --> 00:34:56.840
am I going to learn
better from somebody

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.270
that might be in the fourth,
versus somebody that's

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:00.530
in the ninth or tenth?

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:02.510
I was sure that this--
so just if people

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.426
didn't follow that, I
was sure that this would

00:35:04.426 --> 00:35:06.740
be the case, that it wouldn't
just be the case that you

00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:09.140
as a student would learn
well from somebody who

00:35:09.140 --> 00:35:12.329
was at the very
bottom of performance

00:35:12.329 --> 00:35:14.370
compared to the very top,
compared to the middle.

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:16.400
I was sure that what
would really be going on

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.200
is that the best thing,
the optimal thing,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:20.000
would be that you would learn
from somebody a little bit

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.958
better than you or a
little bit worse than you,

00:35:21.958 --> 00:35:23.780
or there would be
some critical distance

00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:26.030
of performance between you
and your teacher that would

00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:27.177
lead to the best outcomes.

00:35:27.177 --> 00:35:29.760
I've looked and I looked, and I
couldn't find it in this data.

00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:33.410
Again, this is a very
abstract toy study with games.

00:35:33.410 --> 00:35:35.651
Who knows how it
relates to outcomes

00:35:35.651 --> 00:35:36.650
in the actual classroom.

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:40.082
I wouldn't be surprised
if that type of gap

00:35:40.082 --> 00:35:41.790
comes more into play
in those situations.

00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.873
But I didn't find it here.

00:35:42.873 --> 00:35:44.310
It's a great question.

00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:45.000
All right.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.910
Thank you, David.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.790
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:51.981 --> 00:35:52.480
All right.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.760
So we just heard two
very different kinds

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.100
of examples of ways
that you can go

00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.404
about studying learning,
one looking at really trying

00:36:00.404 --> 00:36:02.320
to figure out what is
going on in my classroom

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.611
with my students, another
looking in more of a research

00:36:04.611 --> 00:36:08.470
study, experimental situation.

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:11.800
I'm going to give you
two more examples of ways

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:14.380
that people might think
about studying learning,

00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.450
and then we'll get
into trying to ask

00:36:16.450 --> 00:36:18.580
some of our own questions.

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:21.790
OK, so here's our image Again,
the one that Henrike actually

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:24.680
didn't want to talk about.

00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:29.050
So this is an example of some
work done by Peter Felten, who

00:36:29.050 --> 00:36:31.825
is a historian and director
of the Center for Teaching

00:36:31.825 --> 00:36:34.060
and Learning at Elon University.

00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.450
So he's a historian, and
he had given his students

00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:39.160
lots of texts to
analyze, and then

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.100
he started giving his
students visual data.

00:36:42.100 --> 00:36:43.900
And for a while, he
just assumed that they

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:46.370
know what to do with it and
how to make sense of it.

00:36:46.370 --> 00:36:48.039
And then he started
questioning that.

00:36:48.039 --> 00:36:50.330
And so to try to figure out
where his students were at,

00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:52.560
he created some
in-class activities.

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:54.130
And in these
in-class activities,

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:59.650
he gave them a series of
images, visual images,

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:02.650
and had them answer
certain questions

00:37:02.650 --> 00:37:06.220
about, what do you think is
the meaning of this image,

00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.600
where did it come from,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.990
And he also asked them
questions about, if I gave you

00:37:10.990 --> 00:37:15.220
a list of different sources
of historical information,

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:17.950
how would you value
these historical sources?

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:19.690
And based on these
types of questions,

00:37:19.690 --> 00:37:21.460
he actually got
a lot of insights

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:27.010
about how his students thought
about different types of data,

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.410
and in particular how they
were interpreting visual data,

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:30.880
things that he didn't realize.

00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:33.010
And based on what he
learned from these studies,

00:37:33.010 --> 00:37:34.460
it actually changed
his teaching,

00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:36.209
and he introduced new
types of assignments

00:37:36.209 --> 00:37:41.331
to help his students understand
how to deal with visual data.

00:37:41.331 --> 00:37:41.830
All right.

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:49.300
So another way you might go
about studying learning, what

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:52.420
if you have a question
about, I have created

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:55.240
this new online module to help
my students in my chemistry

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.000
class understand
topic A. OK, so what's

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.516
an approach you
could take for that?

00:37:59.516 --> 00:38:01.390
You could imagine that
you give your students

00:38:01.390 --> 00:38:05.500
a pre-test on topic A, and then
you break the students in half.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:08.680
And half of the students have
access to this online module,

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:11.002
and half of the students
have some access

00:38:11.002 --> 00:38:13.210
to other types of materials,
maybe reading materials,

00:38:13.210 --> 00:38:15.220
on this topic, but
not the online module.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.920
And then they might
have a post-test,

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.461
and you can see how
much they learned

00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:22.900
about this topic based on
exposure to this online module.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.840
And you might also give
them some survey questions

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:29.710
about their attitudes and their
experience with this module.

00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:33.490
So this is an example where it's
more on the experimental side.

00:38:33.490 --> 00:38:35.107
You have a control group.

00:38:35.107 --> 00:38:35.940
You have a pre-test.

00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:36.850
You have a post-test.

00:38:36.850 --> 00:38:39.640
You're also assessing attitudes.

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.229
So as Henrike very
nicely described to us,

00:38:42.229 --> 00:38:44.020
there's a lot of
different ways of thinking

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:45.640
about student learning.

00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:50.950
And the first example here,
as Henrike talked about,

00:38:50.950 --> 00:38:53.680
is, I think, in many
ways easier to implement

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.420
in your authentic
classroom setting,

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.450
of you don't have to be breaking
your students into control

00:38:58.450 --> 00:39:00.670
groups and having them
have different educational

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:02.710
experiences.

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:04.210
In the second case,
you'd need to be

00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:08.020
going through IRB approval to
be thinking about your students

00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:08.560
as subjects.

00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:10.180
So there's a lot
of different things

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:14.200
to be thinking about as you
want to study student learning.

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:18.250
Just wanted to get a
range of ideas out there.

00:39:18.250 --> 00:39:21.100
So if you want to
think about what's

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.390
going on in your own
classroom, what you want to do

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:28.870
is, you want to first start
by identifying a problem

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.530
and generating a question.

00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:32.590
And so you want to think
about a question that

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.020
is relevant and meaningful
to you, something that

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.520
is something that
you could actually

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:38.970
study with the students
that you work with.

00:39:38.970 --> 00:39:41.920
And the focus of
this is something

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:45.140
that you actually can tackle
in a reasonable amount of time.

00:39:45.140 --> 00:39:47.980
And I think those are types
of concerns Henrike actually

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:50.650
addressed very nicely.

00:39:50.650 --> 00:39:53.020
So people who are
thinking about SOTL,

00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.310
the scholarship of
teaching and learning,

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:56.980
have broken these
types of questions

00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:58.570
into a number of
different categories.

00:39:58.570 --> 00:39:59.770
And I'm going to just
raise two of them,

00:39:59.770 --> 00:40:02.260
because I think that they're
the easiest to start with.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:05.440
And one is types of
questions about what is.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:07.060
So these are types
of questions that

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.550
are seeking to describe
student learning or teaching

00:40:09.550 --> 00:40:11.530
approaches, just get
a better understanding

00:40:11.530 --> 00:40:15.470
of where your students are at,
what's happening, and so on.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.650
And another type of
question is, what works?

00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:21.250
And these are types of studies
where you're seeking evidence

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.125
for the effectiveness
of a teaching strategy.

00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:32.050
So what you're
going to do now is,

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:35.860
first, I want you to think
about who your audience is.

00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:38.440
So some of you might be
thinking about students

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.630
who you teach
directly, but I also

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:42.070
know that some
people in this room

00:40:42.070 --> 00:40:44.260
are academic professionals
who might be working

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.590
with faculty or with
graduate students,

00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:49.096
and helping other folks like
that with their teaching.

00:40:49.096 --> 00:40:50.470
And so in that
case, you might be

00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:52.480
thinking about
students in a course

00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:55.540
that you support, but maybe
that you don't teach directly.

00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:58.060
Or you might be thinking
about, your audience

00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.340
might actually be the faculty
of the graduate student

00:41:00.340 --> 00:41:02.780
clients whom you work with.

00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:06.250
So what you're going
to do is think about,

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:08.530
what is a question
about their learning

00:41:08.530 --> 00:41:10.240
that you'd like to explore?

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.040
So on your table, you will
find a one-page handout.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:17.800
And so you can work on
this one-page handout.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.990
It specifically asks
the same question.

00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:23.140
And take maybe two minutes
to write down a question,

00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:24.580
and then take
another two minutes

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:26.800
to talk with a neighbor,
to share your questions

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.466
with each other.

00:41:30.340 --> 00:41:33.850
OK So first step is
identifying a question

00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.980
that you care about
about student learning.

00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.990
And of course, our next
question, next step,

00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:41.530
is that we need to think
about gathering evidence.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.060
And there's a lot
of different forms

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.950
that evidence can come in, and
I'm going to go through a few.

00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:51.610
First, you can think about ways
of collecting direct evidence

00:41:51.610 --> 00:41:52.690
about student learning.

00:41:52.690 --> 00:41:54.250
So this is asking
questions directly

00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.340
about what did the
students learn.

00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:59.120
And you might do this through
samples of student work.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.850
You might be looking
very carefully

00:42:00.850 --> 00:42:04.210
at particular responses to
a particular essay prompt.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:07.240
You might be looking carefully
at a set of quiz questions

00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:09.220
on a topic that you care about.

00:42:09.220 --> 00:42:12.880
You might be looking at how the
student created concept maps.

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.160
Maybe you're looking
at student responses

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.680
to a minute paper, where they
answered questions about,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.846
what was the most important
thing you learned today,

00:42:19.846 --> 00:42:21.760
and what questions
do you still have?

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.820
There's all sorts of types of
formative in-class assessments

00:42:24.820 --> 00:42:27.700
that you might analyze, all
different types of student

00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.260
work.

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:32.410
You might be making
observations of students.

00:42:32.410 --> 00:42:35.119
If you want to be studying group
work, you might, in addition

00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:36.910
to doing surveys, you
might have other ways

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:40.270
of actually observing what
they're doing in their groups.

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:42.454
You might collect students'
reflections themselves

00:42:42.454 --> 00:42:44.620
on their own values, their
attitudes, their beliefs.

00:42:47.301 --> 00:42:49.550
There's also indirect evidence
about student learning.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:51.850
So what do students report
that they've learned?

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:55.630
And this might be collected
through surveys or interviews,

00:42:55.630 --> 00:42:57.790
where students are
reflecting on their learning,

00:42:57.790 --> 00:43:02.260
or about their satisfaction
with the learning experience.

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.850
You might also
include reflections

00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:06.430
by instructors about what
their observations are

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:08.344
of student learning.

00:43:08.344 --> 00:43:10.510
And as you're gathering
different types of evidence,

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.912
you can think about both
quantitative approaches.

00:43:13.912 --> 00:43:15.620
So for example, if
you're doing a survey,

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.220
you might have questions
with Likert scales,

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.860
where you have
numerical responses.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:23.050
You might be also looking
at qualitative approaches.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.684
So you might be doing
interviews and focus

00:43:25.684 --> 00:43:27.100
groups, where you
might be getting

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.975
more nuanced type of data.

00:43:28.975 --> 00:43:30.850
So this is to give you
the sense that there's

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:32.433
a lot of different
approaches that you

00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:36.800
can use to collect evidence
about student learning.

00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.790
I also want you to
realize that beyond--

00:43:39.790 --> 00:43:42.415
so there are certainly going to
be cases where you are studying

00:43:42.415 --> 00:43:44.873
student work, and this is going
to be very specific to what

00:43:44.873 --> 00:43:46.840
is happening in your
classroom with assignments

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:47.830
that you've created.

00:43:47.830 --> 00:43:49.899
But there's also a
lot of tools out there

00:43:49.899 --> 00:43:51.190
that you can take advantage of.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:53.200
You don't need to
continually be reinventing

00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:55.610
the wheel for everything.

00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:58.930
So there are ways,
there are a lot of tools

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.870
out there for assessing
student learning or knowledge.

00:44:01.870 --> 00:44:03.230
A couple of examples--

00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:06.220
there's something called
the AACU Value Rubrics,

00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.580
which are some excellent tools.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.413
They're not assessments,
per se, but they're

00:44:09.413 --> 00:44:11.500
rubrics for that
have been created

00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.750
in a lot of different
categories of competencies

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.780
that are valuable for students
to be learning in higher

00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:19.030
education.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:21.610
And then there are a lot
of concept inventories,

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:24.700
particularly in the sciences,
which are very well validated

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.500
instruments looking
at whether students

00:44:26.500 --> 00:44:28.970
have learned key concepts
in different fields.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.410
So these are things that you
can look up for your field.

00:44:32.410 --> 00:44:36.610
And then there's a lot of
scales that are basically

00:44:36.610 --> 00:44:38.860
sets of questions
that are going to get

00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:42.910
at a lot of different attributes
of students-- students'

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.330
academic self-efficacy,
what is their belief

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.350
and their confidence in
their ability to succeed

00:44:47.350 --> 00:44:51.310
in academics; students
critical thinking;

00:44:51.310 --> 00:44:54.730
their motivation;
their metacognition,

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.810
so their ability to reflect
on their own learning.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.040
There are scales about student
strategies for learning,

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:06.640
students' study
behaviors, and much more.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.590
So those are some examples.

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.380
I put a reference that's on
the bottom of your handout

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:14.707
of this booklet called "The
Compendium of Scales for Use

00:45:14.707 --> 00:45:16.540
in the Scholarship of
Teaching and Learning"

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:18.820
that has lots and lots of
examples and references

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:20.290
for scales that might be useful.

00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.110
OK.

00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.660
So now what I want
you to do is, you've

00:45:28.660 --> 00:45:30.820
got an overview of
types of strategies

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.770
that you might use for
studying student learning.

00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:37.155
And what I want you to
do is, in a small group--

00:45:37.155 --> 00:45:38.530
and what does a
small group mean?

00:45:38.530 --> 00:45:40.930
I'm going to let you choose
whether at your table

00:45:40.930 --> 00:45:44.840
it's best to working in
a group of two or three.

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:47.300
You can divide
yourselves as you wish.

00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:49.300
So maybe groups of two,
maybe groups of three,

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:52.240
if you're at a table of
four, that's also OK.

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:56.020
So you were just starting
to share your questions.

00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:58.120
Choose one of your
questions to focus on

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:00.770
for the rest of this activity.

00:46:00.770 --> 00:46:02.920
And once you've
chosen that question,

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.570
start brainstorming
some approaches

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.230
that you could take to go
about answering that question.

00:46:08.230 --> 00:46:11.270
So we're going to take about
seven minutes to do this.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.570
So in a small group,
pick a question,

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:16.720
and brainstorm some strategies
to answer that question.

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.420
Has everyone figured it out?

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:25.040
You've got some approaches?

00:46:25.040 --> 00:46:25.540
OK.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:31.090
So what we're
going to do now is,

00:46:31.090 --> 00:46:32.680
I'd love to hear
from some of you.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.970
Share with each other what
you've been thinking about.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:38.110
So what question are
you interested in,

00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.560
and what were some
approaches you took?

00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:43.630
So on the bottom
of your handout,

00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:47.290
there are links to a couple of
great websites with information

00:46:47.290 --> 00:46:49.090
about scholarship of
teaching and learning.

00:46:49.090 --> 00:46:51.100
Also, before you
walk out, there's

00:46:51.100 --> 00:46:55.570
a stapled handout
for each of you.

00:46:55.570 --> 00:46:59.380
These are pages that a group at
Vanderbilt University's Center

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:01.180
for Teaching put together
about scholarship

00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:04.240
of teaching and learning, and
a lot of great information

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.340
about how to start
thinking about a problem

00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:10.720
and how to go about
collecting evidence.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:11.267
All right.

00:47:11.267 --> 00:47:12.100
Thank you very much.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:13.690
Lunch is downstairs.

00:47:13.690 --> 00:47:16.140
