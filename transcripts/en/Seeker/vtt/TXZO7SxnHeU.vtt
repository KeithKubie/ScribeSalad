I’m gonna let you finish, but my last video
was the greatest video of all time!

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.910
Talk about God Complex…

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:15.589
Hey guys, Amy here talking God Complexes on
DNews today, which I can promise you Trace

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.000
does not actually have!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.430
We’ve all heard about a God Complex. Donald
Trump is one current celebrity accused of

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:25.860
having one. His outward arrogance and overall
mean public demeanor are typical of a highly

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.220
narcissistic leader.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.620
But what exactly is a God Complex? And is
it a real psychological affliction?

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.000
Properly called Narcissistic Personality Disorder,
a so-called God Complex is a rare mental disorder

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.790
characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance,
entitlement, a deep need for admiration, and

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.760
an alarming lack of empathy for other people.
And it can get extreme to the point where

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.010
someone with NPD doesn’t even see the people
around them as human. It’s an obsessive

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.660
preoccupation with status and power that gives
NPD the moniker “God Complex.”

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.010
But that confidence is typically a veneer
masking such cripplingly low self-esteem that

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.330
the slightest criticism can lead to a complete
breakdown. This makes the need for admiration

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.950
stronger, which in turn adds to the individual’s
inflated sense of self-worth. It’s a bit

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.799
of a disastrous cycle.

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.040
Like so many mental disorders, it’s not
entirely known what causes NPD, though it’s

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.820
thought to be rooted in either excessive pampering
or criticism from parents or a genetic predisposition,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.299
and it typically affects more males than females
beginning in the teen years or early adulthood.

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.320
A 2012 study the journal Personality and Individual
Differences found that people who scored higher

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.860
on a Narcissistic Personality Inventory tended
to have more Facebook friends, tag themselves

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.689
in more pictures, and update their statuses
more frequently. This all points to someone

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.720
showing how great they are with no interest
in anyone else, but that doesn't just play

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.680
out online.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.390
Unsurprisingly, a narcissistic personality
disorder can affect so many areas of someone’s

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.360
life, leading to unfulfilling relationships,
a problematic professional career, financial

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.549
troubles, and alcohol abuse, all of which
will ultimately isolate the one with the God

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.630
complex even more.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.530
But does extreme narcissism make someone a
good leader? There’s conflicting answers

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.189
on any correlation between narcissism and
people who end up in strong leadership positions.

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.149
One 2014 study from the University of Nebraska
Lincoln says no. Narcissism can be useful

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.550
in certain situations and over-the-top confidence
in an interview scenario can be useful, but

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.840
in the end narcissists are more likely to
take undue risks and alienate their coworkers,

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.250
weakening their overall position. Business
Insider, however, disagrees, pointing to the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.480
same traits the Nebraska studies find negative
to be positive. Narcissists, the article argues,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.020
demonstrate vision, attract followers, are
highly persuasive, and unafraid to take risks.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.260
But there’s no clear cut answer to whether
narcissists make natural leaders. As the Harvard

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.050
Business Review points out in a 2000 article,
narcissism tends to come hand-in-hand with

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.120
a crippling distrust in others, meaning even
the most accomplished narcissists can become

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.870
known for self–involvement, unpredictability,
and paranoia, all qualities that don’t make

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.450
for the best leaders, or friends or even presidential
candidates.
