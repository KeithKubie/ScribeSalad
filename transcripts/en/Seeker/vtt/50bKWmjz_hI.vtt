Roller coasters.

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:02.089
Bad sushi.

00:00:02.089 --> 00:00:03.089
Public Speaking.

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:04.990
All things that make you puke.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.530
But why?

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.680
Hey guys, Chastity here for DNews.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.280
We're gonna be tackling your science questions
every Monday.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.450
This week's viewer question comes from Sam
Litsas, who asks, "How/why do we vomit?"

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.619
Great question, Sam.

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070
Unfortunately, there's no short answer to
why we puke.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.570
As I’m sure you’ve all experienced, vomiting
is an involuntary expulsion of your stomach

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.910
contents through your mouth and sometimes
your nose.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:28.910
Ick.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:30.630
Even though it’s gross, it’s actually
a good thing!

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.870
Because vomiting defends you from being poisoned.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.790
The part of the brain that manages poison
control is called the area postrema.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.140
This part is exposed to the bloodstream, allowing
it to scan for toxins.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.219
When a toxin is spotted, like as a result
of one too many tequila shots, the area postrema

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.290
tells the body to purge the stomach.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.150
When you vomit, several things happen to your
body at once.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.280
Your blood moves to your internal organs,
causing your face to lose color.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.170
Your teeth are coated in saliva to shield
them from your stomach acid.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.820
You break a sweat, your blood pressure drops,
your heart races, and you start to breathe

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.399
faster as you retch.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.100
The large muscles of your respiratory system
reverse the path of your digestive tract,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.970
turning you into a human geyser.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.780
It’s uncomfortable, involuntary, and a big
ol’ mess.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.340
But it’s also a unique ability!

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.270
Other than humans, there are only a few animals
that can vomit, like cats and dogs.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.439
Mice and other rodents, however, can't.

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.829
Neither can horses.

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:21.789
Rodents lack the key neural circuits that
tell the stomach to purge.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.729
They also have a powerful seal that separates
the esophagus and the stomach, which cannot

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:26.729
open.

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.159
That explains why rat poison is so effective.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.579
Horses also have a strong band of muscle around
the esophagus.

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:34.749
It operates as a one-way valve as it enters
the stomach.

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:38.389
Food can go down into the horse's stomach
as this valve relaxes, but the valve squeezes

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:41.429
down on the opening, preventing food from
going back up.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:42.509
So why do people vomit?

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.770
The list of causes is lengthy: Drinking too
much alcohol,

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.840
Prescription and nonprescription drugs, Food
poisoning, or viral infections that inflame

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.770
your gut and cause severe stomach pain.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.249
Throwing up can also be triggered by your
stomach’s nervous system telling you it’s

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:56.249
too full.

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:59.069
Feeling afraid or disgusted can also make
us nauseous.

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:02.249
If you’ve ever puked during a gory movie
or at the sight of blood, it’s because the

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:04.520
unpleasant visuals stimulate nausea.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.259
These visuals cause the limbic system in your
brain, which controls emotions, to feel distressed.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.170
This distress causes the autonomic nervous
system, which controls internal organs, to

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.540
tell your stomach to purge.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.569
So even though you’re not really exposed
to a life-threatening poison, your body has

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.569
a hard time differentiating emotional and
physical stress.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.599
In either case, it reacts the same way.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.739
One of the things that makes me nauseous is
air travel.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.150
Why does flying make us feel sick?

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:41.489
Julian answers that in 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:51.529
this video.
