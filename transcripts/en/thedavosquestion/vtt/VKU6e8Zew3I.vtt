00:00:01.449 --> 00:00:07.160
So will China close out the economic crisis?
I think it's gonna help. The stimulus package,

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.339
or the size of the stimulus package in China,
is huge. I don't think, given America is still

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:19.780
25 percent of the world's economy, Europe
is another 25 percent of the world's economy.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.650
And I think China, on it's own, is going to
pull the world out of economic crisis. I don't

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.340
think it's big enough yet. It will probably
be the biggest economy in the world in about

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.960
20 years time. But I don't think there's enough
umpf in the Chinese economy to pull the world

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.430
out of recession. Only America and Europe
have got a turn around. And China can't do

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.611
it alone. It can't pull this weight just on
its own.
