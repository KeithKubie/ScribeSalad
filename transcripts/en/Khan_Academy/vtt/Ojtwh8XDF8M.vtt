00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:01.650
- [Instructor] What we
wanna do in this video

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.898
is figure out what the
limit, as x approaches zero,

00:00:05.898 --> 00:00:10.065
of one minus cosine of
x over x is equal to.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.662
And we're going to assume we
know one thing ahead of time.

00:00:13.662 --> 00:00:15.882
We're going to assume
we know that the limit,

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.882
as x approaches zero, of sine of x over x,

00:00:21.807 --> 00:00:23.819
that this is equal to one.

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:25.551
Now, I'm not gonna reprove
this in this video,

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:26.861
but we have a whole other video

00:00:26.861 --> 00:00:30.511
dedicated to proving this famous limit,

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:33.885
and we do it using the squeeze,
or the sandwich theorem.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.316
So, let's see if we can work this out.

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:37.726
So the first thing we're going to do

00:00:37.726 --> 00:00:40.306
is algebraically
manipulate this expression.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:42.256
What I'm going to do is
I'm going to multiply

00:00:42.256 --> 00:00:44.171
both the numerator and the denominator

00:00:44.171 --> 00:00:46.171
by one plus cosine of x.

00:00:49.278 --> 00:00:50.242
So, times...

00:00:50.242 --> 00:00:51.630
The denominator I have
to do the same thing,

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.531
one plus cosine of x.

00:00:53.531 --> 00:00:55.088
I'm not changing the
value of the expression,

00:00:55.088 --> 00:00:57.355
this is just multiplying it by one.

00:00:57.355 --> 00:00:59.019
What does that do for us?

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:00.352
Well I can rewrite the whole thing as

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:03.269
the limit, as x approaches zero,

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.596
so one minus cosine of x
times one plus cosine of x,

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:10.424
well that is just going to be...

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.591
Put this in another color.

00:01:13.672 --> 00:01:18.339
That is going to be one
squared, which is just one,

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:20.796
minus cosine squared of x.

00:01:20.796 --> 00:01:23.826
Cosine squared of x,
difference of squares.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:27.731
And then in the denominator,
I am going to have

00:01:27.731 --> 00:01:31.898
these, which is just x
times 1 plus cosine of x.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:39.185
Now what is one minus cosine squared of x?

00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.074
Well, this comes straight out of the

00:01:40.074 --> 00:01:42.890
Pythagorean identity, trig identity.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.981
This is the same thing
as the sine squared of x.

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.814
So, sine squared of x.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.981
And so, I can rewrite all
of this as being equal to

00:01:52.981 --> 00:01:55.898
the limit, as x approaches zero,

00:01:57.971 --> 00:01:59.815
and let me rewrite this as...

00:01:59.815 --> 00:02:01.256
Instead of sine squared of x,

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:03.882
that's the same thing as
sine of x times sine of x.

00:02:03.882 --> 00:02:04.753
Let me write it that way.

00:02:04.753 --> 00:02:06.670
Sine x times sine x.

00:02:09.246 --> 00:02:11.547
So, I'll take the first sine of x,

00:02:11.547 --> 00:02:14.450
so I'll take this one right over here,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.282
and put it over this x.

00:02:16.282 --> 00:02:18.199
So, sine of x over x

00:02:19.787 --> 00:02:22.870
times the second sine of x, this one,

00:02:24.073 --> 00:02:26.879
over one plus cosine of x

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.629
times sine of x over one plus cosine of x.

00:02:32.765 --> 00:02:35.742
All I've done is I've leveraged
a trigonometric identity,

00:02:35.742 --> 00:02:37.872
and I've done a little bit
of algebraic manipulation.

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:40.541
Well here, the limit of the product

00:02:40.541 --> 00:02:42.382
of these two expressions, is
going to be the same thing

00:02:42.382 --> 00:02:43.957
as the product of the limits.

00:02:43.957 --> 00:02:47.207
So I can rewrite this as being equal to

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.537
the limit, as x approaches
zero, of sine of x over x

00:02:55.772 --> 00:02:59.189
times the limit, as x approaches zero,

00:03:01.935 --> 00:03:05.435
of sine of x over one plus cosine of x.

00:03:07.826 --> 00:03:09.661
Now, we said, going into this video,

00:03:09.661 --> 00:03:11.909
that we're going to assume
that we know what this is.

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:13.571
We've proven it in other videos.

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.339
What is the limit, as x approaches zero,

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:17.054
of sine of x over x?

00:03:17.054 --> 00:03:19.781
Well, that is equal to one.

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:21.891
So, this whole limit is
just going to be dependent

00:03:21.891 --> 00:03:23.607
on whatever this is equal to.

00:03:23.607 --> 00:03:26.215
Well, this is pretty
straight forward, here.

00:03:26.215 --> 00:03:29.333
As x approaches zero, the
numerator's approaching zero,

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.793
sine of zero is zero.

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:32.672
The denominator is approaching...

00:03:32.672 --> 00:03:34.095
Cosine of zero is one,

00:03:34.095 --> 00:03:36.133
so the denominator is approaching two.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.630
So this is approaching zero
over two, or just zero.

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.053
That's approaching zero.

00:03:42.053 --> 00:03:46.319
One times zero, well this is
just going to be equal to zero.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.193
And we're done.

00:03:47.193 --> 00:03:49.650
Using that fact, and a little
bit of trig identities,

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.308
and a little bit of
algebraic manipulation,

00:03:51.308 --> 00:03:53.514
we were able to show
that our original limit,

00:03:53.514 --> 00:03:54.772
the limit, as x approaches zero,

00:03:54.772 --> 00:03:58.958
of one minus cosine of x
over x is equal to zero.

00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.072
And I encourage you to graph it.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.575
You will see that that makes sense

00:04:01.575 --> 00:04:04.107
from a graphical point of view, as well.
