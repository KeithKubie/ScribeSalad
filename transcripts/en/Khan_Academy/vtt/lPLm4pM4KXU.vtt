00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:00.960
Welcome back.

00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.540
We're on problem number 12.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.400
If k is a positive integer, what
is the least value of k

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.330
for which the square root
of 5k/3 is an integer?

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.250
So this whole thing has
to be an integer.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.230
If the whole thing is going to
be an integer, the thing

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.680
inside of the square root has
to be an integer as well.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.270
The square root of a
fraction is never

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:25.620
going to be an integer.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.400
So 5k/3 is going to
be an integer.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.290
And we could also immediately
say that k has to be a

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.960
multiple of 3.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.479
That's the only way this is
going to be an integer.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:34.410
But let's think about what
type of a perfect

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.030
square this has to be.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.650
This perfect square, it has
to be divisible by 5.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.720
How do I know that?

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.360
Well, let's just rewrite
it as 5 times k/3.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.220
It has to be a multiple of 5,
and this has to be an integer,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.470
which we just said. k has
to be divisible by 3.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:55.820
The only way that this whole
thing is going to be an

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.540
integer is if k/3
is an integer.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.670
So what is the smallest
perfect square that is

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:02.920
divisible by 5?

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.650
Because we want k to be the
smallest possible number.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.700
The smallest possible integer.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.820
So the smallest perfect square
that is a multiple of 5 is, of

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.060
course, 5 squared,
which is 25.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.750
So let's set this equal to 25.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.150
So 5k/3 is going to
be equal to 25.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.680
Let's see, we can multiply
both sides by 3.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.590
You get 5k is equal to 75.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.090
Divide both sides by 5.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.550
You get k is equal to 15.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.600
And you can try it out.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.110
Put 15 in here, this whole
thing becomes 25.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.780
And then the square
root becomes 5.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:41.980
And they're all integers.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.230
Next problem.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.100
OK, they drew some boxes
or some shapes.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.550
This one's 1.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.170
And this one looks something
like this.

00:01:56.264 --> 00:01:58.410
That's 1, 1.

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.020
And then this one looks
something like this.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.340
This is 2, 1.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.190
The figures above represent
three pieces of cardboard.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.820
All angles of the cardboard
pieces are right angles.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:13.070
Fair enough.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.910
All short sides have length
1, and all long

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.090
sides have length 2.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900
Which of the following figures
could have been made from only

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.920
the three pieces of cardboard
without overlapping them.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.200
So let's draw these choices.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.150
So choice one looks like this.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.990
It comes down like this.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.950
This is 2.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.610
This comes down like this.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.750
This goes like this.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.360
And this length is 3.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.020
So maybe I'll try to fit the
biggest piece in and see what

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.860
I have left over.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.240
So the only place where
that big piece can

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.490
fit in is right here.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.420
That's the only place the
big piece can fit in.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.050
And then I could fit
in the small piece.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.710
I could put it here.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.020
But then have no space.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.430
That or that is not enough
space for this piece.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.800
So one does not work.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.050
Choice two.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:18.142
So it has length 4 and it
goes 2, 1, like that.

00:03:18.142 --> 00:03:21.520
And then it goes 2, then
it comes back.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:24.730
So this is 2, 2, this is 1.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.960
So where can I fit
the big piece?

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.585
Let's try that first. Well, the
really only place where it

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:30.450
will fit, because it's 3
wide, is right here.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.520
This is the only place where
the big piece will fit.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.970
And then where can I fit
the small piece?

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:42.410
Well, this looks like a pretty
obvious place for the small

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.416
piece, because, obviously, the
medium piece isn't going to be

00:03:44.416 --> 00:03:45.250
fit right there.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.550
And can I fit the
medium piece?

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.770
Can this piece fit here?

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.640
Well, sure, I just have
to rotate it.

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:51.460
And how do I know that?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.970
Well, let me show, if
I can visualize it.

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:00.010
If I rotate it so that this side
becomes this side, and

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.530
that this side, right here,
becomes this side.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.910
And then I could keep going.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.830
I could say this side
is this side.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.660
This is actually
strangely fun.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.102
This side is this side.

00:04:16.102 --> 00:04:18.269
And I think you get
the picture.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.769
This side is this side.

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:21.380
So I think you get the idea.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.050
I just rotated it.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.290
So this one works.

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:24.780
Choice two works.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.810
Let's look at choice three.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.740
Choice three looks like this.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.080
It's also 4 high, go out 1, down
step-- this looks like a

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.940
step-- goes down 2.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.925
Then it comes out like that.

00:04:38.925 --> 00:04:40.670
It comes like that.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.580
And this is 4, 1, 1, 2, 1.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:45.885
So where can we fit
the big piece?

00:04:45.885 --> 00:04:47.730
The big piece is 3 wide.

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.970
So this is the only part that's
3 wide, but there's no

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.790
place to stick the bottom
part of the big piece.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.670
The big piece could fit like
this, but there's no place to

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.610
put this part.

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.410
So the big piece, I can't figure
out a way to make the

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.930
big piece fit.

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:00.650
And I don't think it can,
because this is the only part

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:03.260
that's 3 wide, because
it has to be 3 wide.

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.600
So choice three is also
not the answer.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.970
So the answer is two only,
and that's choice C.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.220
Next problem.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.230
Problem 14.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.770
How many integers greater than
20 and less than 30 are each

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.860
the product of exactly two
different numbers, both of

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.200
which are prime?

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.020
Exactly two different numbers,
both of which are-- so let's

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.380
just list out all the numbers.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.500
Between 20 and 30, not including
those two, because

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.810
greater than 20, less than 30.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:48.110
So 21, 22, 23, 24, 25,
26, 27, 28, 29.

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.770
So should we count 1 and
the number as factors?

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.830
Well, no, because 1 is
not a prime number.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.710
Prime numbers are all the
numbers greater than or equal

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.330
to 2 that have 1 and itself
as the only factors.

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.510
So let's see how many factors
other than 1 and itself are

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:06.510
both different and both prime.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.970
So this has 3 and 7,
and that's all I

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:10.610
can get out of it.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:13.300
And these are both prime,
so this works.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.330
This has 2 times 11.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:17.280
These are both prime.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.810
I can't think of any other two
numbers that divide into 22.

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:21.880
So that one works.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.660
23 only has 1 times 23.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.930
1 isn't prime.

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:28.140
I mean, all of these also have
the kind of identity factors,

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.550
so it's not 23.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.110
24 has 2 times 12, and
6 times 4, and none

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.920
of those are prime.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.690
So 24 doesn't work.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.920
25 has 5 times 5.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.500
Both are prime, but they're not
different numbers, so that

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.840
doesn't work.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.120
2 times 13 goes to 26 and that's
the only factor, so

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.420
that works.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.970
27 has 3 times 9, but 9 isn't
prime, it's a composite

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.520
number, divisible by 3,
so that doesn't work.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.440
28 has 2 times 14, and 7 times
2 and-- so it has multiple

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.940
factors and 14 isn't prime,
so it doesn't work.

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.990
29 is prime, so it doesn't
have any other different

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.265
numbers, two different
numbers that divide

00:07:06.265 --> 00:07:06.850
into it that are prime.

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:07.730
It only has 1 times 29.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.760
It doesn't have anything else,
and 1 isn't prime.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.290
So there's 1, 2, 3 choices.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.330
So that's D.

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.360
I actually think this was a
little badly worded because, I

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:25.360
don't know, you could argue that
the number itself is a

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:29.890
factor-- or I guess the product
of exactly two numbers

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.810
and 1 can't count.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.220
It has to be the product of two
numbers, and so you can't

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.740
count 1 and itself because
1 is not a prime number.

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:38.510
Both of the numbers
that make up the

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:40.620
product have to be prime.

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:46.940
Problem number 15.

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.190
So they drew this triangle.

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.580
They tell us that this
is 7 minus x.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.580
This is 7 plus x.

00:07:57.580 --> 00:07:58.480
This is 10.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.840
This is 90 degrees.

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.750
And they say, in the figure
above is a right triangle.

00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:05.490
What is the value of
49 plus x squared?

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:06.680
So let's do the Pythagorean
theoreum.

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.610
This squared plus this squared
has to equal that squared.

00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:16.120
So 7 minus x, squared plus
7 plus x, squared is

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.870
going to equal 100.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:23.170
This equals 49 minus
2x, plus x squared.

00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:28.950
This is equal to plus 49 plus
2x, plus x squared, and that

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.300
equals 100.

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.260
This minus 2x and this plus 2x
are going to cancel out.

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:36.330
And now this is what?

00:08:36.330 --> 00:08:39.750
49 plus 49, that's the same
thing as 2 times 49.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:40.970
And then you have
x squared plus x

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:43.260
squared, plus 2x squared.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:44.950
I could have multiplied this
out, but you'll see why I

00:08:44.950 --> 00:08:47.550
didn't, because I want to
preserve that 49 in there.

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.780
And that equals, so this is
100, this equals 100.

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.950
Factor out the 2.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:09:00.430
You get 2 times 49, plus x
squared is equal to 100.

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:02.050
Preserve the 49.

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.450
And then divide both
sides by 2.

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:07.790
You get 49 plus x squared
is equal to 50.

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:08.780
And we are done.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:09.630
That's the answer.

00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:11.350
That's choice A.

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:13.150
See you in the next video.
