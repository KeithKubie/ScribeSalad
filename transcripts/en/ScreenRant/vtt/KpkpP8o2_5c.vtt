00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.290
Being a professional actor doesn’t always
mean that they can keep a straight face and

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.670
why should it?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.380
Acting is a fun profession and they ought
to enjoy themselves while working on set.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.730
Even if they have won numerous acting awards
for their serious roles they should never

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.109
shy from having a good time.

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.279
Some actors are surprisingly funny and these
comedy chops can be seen in numerous bloopers

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:23.510
from their films.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.390
Here is Screen Rant’s list of ten Movie
Bloopers From Usually Serious Actors.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.240
Naomi Watts in King Kong

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.829
The English born actress Naomi Watts has starred
in dramatic roles such films as Mulholland

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:37.960
Drive, 21 Grams and J Edgar.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.870
She’s known as a professional actress on
set but when she was working on Peter Jackson’s

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.569
King Kong she had a few breakups during scenes.

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:49.100
Maybe these bloopers are enticed by her co-star
Jack Black or Kong himself but either way

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.350
it is fun to see such a serious actress break
up.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.649
Each time she botches her line she added a
much stronger word in its place, making for

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:04.309
hilarious outtakes.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.990
Josh Brolin in Men in Black 3

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.570
Josh Brolin moved from being the older brother
in 1985’s The Goonies to playing President

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.020
George W. Bush in W and Thanos in numerous
Marvel films.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.941
He’s an Oscar nominated actor for his serious
roles and has co-starred with some of the

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:19.941
greatest.

00:01:19.941 --> 00:01:23.590
He was given the chance to let his guard down
but he had to keep his serious face since

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.830
he was portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones
in Men in Black 3.

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.020
The only time we get to see Brolin break a
smile is in the outtakes, where he makes funny

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:40.830
voices, let’s off steam and shows his weak
fighting skills.

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.719
Emma Watson in Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.990
When working on Harry Potter and the Deathly
Hallows the young star, Emma Watson couldn’t

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.100
hold it together.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.710
There would be these awkward silences in the
scenes and the actress couldn’t keep it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.100
together.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.710
Giggling take after take, the director added
a system to stop his young cast from laughing.

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.689
He would fine them a found after each take
they ruined.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.000
This was all in good fun but Watson did have
the most fines on set.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Billy Bob Thornton in Bad Santa

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
When making a movie sometimes the director
or writer will have the actor try different

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
lines in a scene, these lines are usually
jokes and they are trying to find the strongest

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000
one.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
All the takes that they don’t use get to
go on the blooper reel and we get a good amount

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of laughs from it.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000
In Bad Santa, Billy Bob Thornton is making
his way out the mall when a security guard

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
stops him and asks if he might be stealing
something in his baggy pants.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
This starts a long line of one-liners from
Thornton, which are of course…bad.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That’s not the Christmas spirit but it is
funny!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Natalie Portman in Your Highness

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.780
Natalie Portman is remarkable in her dramatic
roles and even won an Oscar for best actress

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.610
in the dark drama Black Swan.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.970
Branching out into comedy, Portman co-starred
in 2011’s Your Highness along side Danny

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.760
McBride and James Franco.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.240
Portman had a line that involved calling her
female anatomy a beaver and just couldn’t

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:37.000
get through it.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.260
Take after take she stumbled, even trying
to change the line to better suit her needs.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:58.750
It’s okay, because she does make it up with
a memorable swimming scene in the film.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.560
Jeremy Renner in Avengers: Age of Ultron

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.579
Marvel blooper reels are fan favorites and
everyone can’t wait to buy the Blu-Ray to

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.510
see the newest gag reel.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.349
Sometimes the crew actually films a fake scene
to add to the blooper reel like Jeremy Renner

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.300
and the Avengers team did for Avengers: Age
of Ultron.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.620
At the cost of his life Quicksiler saves Hawkeye
from a bullet and Hawkeye carries his body

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.909
onto a Lifeboat.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.610
In the film Quicksilver lies dead but in the
alternate version he wakes up only to be smothered

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:25.610
to death by Hawkeye.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:37.020
Hawkeye does not seem to be very grateful.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:39.319
Bryan Cranston in Total Recall

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.810
Since Bryan Cranston starred in five seasons
of Breaking Bad the world has seen his serious

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.250
side and we love it.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.160
He’s a pretty cool guy, busting the chops
of fans at Comic-Con or fighting off Godzilla.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.980
He’s been in numerous biopics and has been
awarded countless awards for his dramatic

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:54.980
roles.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:59.090
During the filming of 2012’s Total Recall
he had some issues remembering the dialogue

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:19.049
“I want him alive for re-implantation”
and goofs up his line time and time again.

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:21.480
Kate Beckinsale in Underworld: Awakening

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.250
It’s hard to believe Kate Beckinsale can
do anything wrong but during the filming of

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.040
2012’s Underworld: Awakening she has numerous
bloopers.

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.830
Fighting Lycan’s is dangerous and hard work
but sometimes you just have to take a break

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:33.910
and dance.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.290
In a slow motion scene Beckinsale kills a
Lycan by firing off a few shots and takes

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.220
a misstep causing her to go into a dance.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:51.070
In real life not even a Lycan would pass up
the opportunity to dance with her.

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.200
Malcolm McDowell in Halloween

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:58.490
Ever since 1971 when Malcolm McDowell starred
in Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange audiences

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.920
have known him as a serious actor.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.350
Usually cast a bad guy in 2007’s remake
of the 1978 horror classic, Halloween, he

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.270
is being chased by the bad guy, or boogeyman.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.220
In a blooper where Michael Myers breaks in
from a door behind him McDowell goes into

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.160
a hilarious improv rant to the masked killer.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:43.590
Maybe this is why McDowell has been cast in
so many comedies throughout 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:06:08.880
his career.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.280
Hugh Jackman in Van Helsing

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.990
Hugh Jackman is a lot of fun on set and you
can see this just from his outtakes.

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.830
During the filming of Van Helsing, the star
not only broke character numerous times to

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.680
dance with his co-star or break into laugher
but he also had a hard time in his costume.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:29.030
That heavy outfit kept getting in his way
and he trips his way through the blooper reel

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.030
of the film.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:35.190
Looks like Jackman needs to practice his stunt
maneuvers before his next film.

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:36.600
