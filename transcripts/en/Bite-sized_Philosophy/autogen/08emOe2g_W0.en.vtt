meaning is composed of the union of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910
meaning is composed of the union of
 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.640

holes of all sorts that that are
 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.890
holes of all sorts that that are
one-sided pursuits of meaning so and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900
one-sided pursuits of meaning so and
 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.240

some something we're actually going to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
some something we're actually going to
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700

the question is how do you stop yourself

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
the question is how do you stop yourself
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.859
the question is how do you stop yourself
from falling prey to a pathologist sense

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
from falling prey to a pathologist sense
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.570
from falling prey to a pathologist sense
of meaning and I think one of the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
of meaning and I think one of the
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.810
of meaning and I think one of the
answers to that is don't lie because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820
answers to that is don't lie because
 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.609
answers to that is don't lie because
what you're hoping is that your nervous

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
what you're hoping is that your nervous
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.490
what you're hoping is that your nervous
system is sufficiently healthy and well

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
system is sufficiently healthy and well
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.039
system is sufficiently healthy and well
programmed so that what it reads out to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049
programmed so that what it reads out to
 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.609
programmed so that what it reads out to
you is reliable and if you pathologize

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619
you is reliable and if you pathologize
 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.530
you is reliable and if you pathologize
your psyche by either through sins of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540
your psyche by either through sins of
 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.749
your psyche by either through sins of

omission let's say or outright deception
you're going to work that internal

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
you're going to work that internal
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.600
you're going to work that internal
structure and it's not going to read out

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610
structure and it's not going to read out
 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.700
structure and it's not going to read out
properly to you and then your sense of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710
properly to you and then your sense of
 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.770
properly to you and then your sense of
meaning will leave you astray so like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780
meaning will leave you astray so like
 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.920
meaning will leave you astray so like
one of the reasons for speaking the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930
one of the reasons for speaking the
 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.539
one of the reasons for speaking the
truth I shouldn't say that because you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549
truth I shouldn't say that because you
 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.800
truth I shouldn't say that because you
don't know how to speak the truth but

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810
don't know how to speak the truth but
 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.429
don't know how to speak the truth but
you do know how not to lie and it's a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439
you do know how not to lie and it's a
 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.810
you do know how not to lie and it's a
game you're playing with yourself you

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820
game you're playing with yourself you
 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639
game you're playing with yourself you
can define the damn lies no one else has

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649
can define the damn lies no one else has
 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.700
can define the damn lies no one else has
to do that for you you you try not to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710
to do that for you you you try not to
 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.609
to do that for you you you try not to
utter falsehoods because you warp your

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619
utter falsehoods because you warp your
 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.559
utter falsehoods because you warp your
neurological structure by doing so and

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569
neurological structure by doing so and
 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.690
neurological structure by doing so and
then it will read out pathologically and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
then it will read out pathologically and
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.580
then it will read out pathologically and
then if you rely on it to guide you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590
then if you rely on it to guide you
 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.949
then if you rely on it to guide you
we'll run you right off a cliff so
