00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.190
&gt;&gt; Um, can India become a superpower?
I think yes, certainly, yes.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.710
I think India has all the -- all the ingredients,
the raw ingredients

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:26.830
to become a superpower.
Whether it happens in ten years or in 15 years,

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:34.260
remains to see.
It has the size, the geographic size as well

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:45.909
as the economic so -- and,
but I think we need to India is important

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:56.389
superpower it wants to be, it
has the power to react very well [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.949
and has potential to have
good impact around the world.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:11.600
What [INAUDIBLE] at least the current India
is based on the [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.590
India wants to become empowered base of peace
and prosperity.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:26.229
And culture that [INAUDIBLE] superpower.
Three years, and so it has been revealed to

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:35.439
become a power superpower,
30, 40 years or even less but the world would

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:41.340
like to see India become
a superpower, a real base that is possible

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.020
here [INAUDIBLE]
Thank you.
