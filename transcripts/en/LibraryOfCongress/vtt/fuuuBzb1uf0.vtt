&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: Okay,
folks, I'm Guha Shankar.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.670
I'm here at the American
Folklife Center

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.780
with the Folklife specialists
and I want to welcome all

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.080
of you to the symposium.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.730
It's going to be a great
turnout, a great group of guests

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.840
and a fascinating topic, and
I'm going to turn the podium

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.960
over to the head of research
and programs John Fenn.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.290
He'll do the welcoming
remarks, the official ones.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.270
In the meantime, what I wanted
to do was to give you a sense

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.590
of what the symposium entails.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.540
As you know, 50 years ago,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.150
Dr. Martin Luther King's last
great unfinished social mass

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.380
action, the Poor People's
Campaign, was taking place here

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.060
in Washington, DC, on the mall.

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:57.880
And in order to tell
you a little bit

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.410
about what came before,
we're actually going to start

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.340
at the present and
talk to you about --

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.980
tell you a little bit
about what's happening

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.240
with the new Poor People's
Campaign, which just launched

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.860
over the course of
the last year or so

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.880
with actions across the country.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.550
It'll be -- it's been led by
the Reverend William Barber,

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.580
formerly of the NAACP, and
the Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.100
who is -- who were both
of the Kairos Institute,

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.760
a Union Theological
Seminary up in New York.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.460
And we're going to start
with this brief framing,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.920
a video about the new
Poor People's Campaign.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.720

&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: We must
be honest about the foundations

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.710
of the political and economic
systems we call America.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.520
I love America because
of her potential,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.130
but I know that America
will never even get close

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.450
to being a more perfect
nation until we are honest

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.730
about the politics of rejection.

want to tell you about some

the Poor People's Campaign.

Callie Greer from
Selma, Alabama,

who had to bury her
daughter Venus

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.200
because she didn't
have health care.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.500
&gt;&gt; Callie Greer: I'm here today

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.800
to share my daughter
Venus's story.

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.670
Venus discovered a small
lump in her breast.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.090
She wasn't insured.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.540
Venus had to be approved
for every prescription

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.440
and every piece of medical
equipment that she needed.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.150
I'm standing here
today in solidarity

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.990
with the Poor People's Campaign
because no one should have

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.950
to bury their child in America

I've lived in poverty here
in West Virginia every day

and I've experienced the
cycle of poverty firsthand.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.730
Growing up, I watched my
mother endure long hours

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.240
of back-breaking labor
doing everything she could

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.860
to feed me and my sisters.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.830
My employer barely pays
me enough to pay rent

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.700
and utilities, let alone the
medical expenses with my mother.

I worked 41 years
in the coal mines.

I have black lung and it's just
unfathomable what these poor

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.320
coal miners have to
go through in order

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.130
to get what they have
worked for and deserve.

that you didn't have water and
you couldn't afford your water.

It's a whole 'nother to find

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.010

your entire community

town of 16,000 who are homeless.

my community, we were all shut

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:20.830
out for the day because none of
us could afford our water bills.

In the past, my family
wasn't able

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.850
to afford electricity
in the winter.

For a country that's rich
to have so many people poor,

I invite you to enjoy and
engage the dynamic set

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.380

of our programming

at the American Folklife Center,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.210
these sessions are
being captured on video

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:18.980
by the library's multimedia
team for two purposes.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.010
To enrich our permanent
collections

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:23.340
and to serve patrons
of far as webcasts.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:25.330
Once they are posted, the
videos will be accessible

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.590
to audiences beyond
the walls of this room.

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:30.300
As such, I ask you to
please turn off or put

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.070
on airplane mode your cellular
device because they do interfere

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:36.610
with the wireless microphones.

00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:38.990
Through these panels, we
will be exploring the concept

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:42.220
of documenting the now,
with now oscillating

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.930
between two poles,
1968 and 2018.

00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:48.990
Fifty years ago, Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. and a cohort

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.230
of collaborators launched
an ambitious effort

00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.660
to bring attention to the
plate of under-resourced

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.250
and underrepresented
communities across the country,

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:58.120
the Poor People's Campaign.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.380
Social justice and
advocacy intertwined

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.540
with cultural programming
and documentation during

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:05.720
that campaign, especially
here on the mall in DC,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.700
resulting in rich collections
held in the Library of Congress

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:10.230
as well as its sister
institutions,

00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.140
such as the Smithsonian
Center for Folklife

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.420
and Cultural Heritage,
and the DC Public Library

00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:16.270
Special Collections.

00:08:16.270 --> 00:08:19.220
What do these collections
let us understand?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.530
What can we do with these
materials and what does it mean

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:24.790
to steward them at
public institutions?

00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:28.830
What do the materials tell us
about the then and the now?

00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.250
In 1968, the PPC was
part of a worldwide surge

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:34.980
in social justice movements
demanding human rights

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.600
and focused on disrupting
the normalization of poverty,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.270
racism or other systems
of exclusion

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:43.680
that have shaped the middle
of the 20th century on.

00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.130
Roughly a generation-and-a-half
later, today, we find ourselves

00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:49.600
in parallel environment wherein
communities are coming together

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.620
to raise visibility, resist
exclusion, and demand change.

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.220
Again, we see the
intersection of social justice

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.040
and cultural activity,
of art in action.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:01.830
And the roles the cultural
documentation holds in an era

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.550
of social media and what
scholar Richard Coyne refers

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:07.390
to as the ubiquity
of digital devices.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:08.990
As with the historical
collections,

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.580
we might ponder what the
contemporaneous collections

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:14.240
of documentation
enable us to understand,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.870
illustrate, and narrate.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:18.610
In other words, what
can we do as curators,

00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.870
reference specialists,
academics, activists

00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:24.250
or citizen scholars, with the
rich documentation being created

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:25.760
in the moment?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.490
We designed this symposium as an
opportunity for a cross-section

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:30.450
of those involved in
cultural movements

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:33.620
and the resultant collections,
to engage in conversations

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:35.690
with each other and with us.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.410
There will be two panels with
a short break between them,

00:09:38.410 --> 00:09:41.040
and each participant on the
panels will give remarks related

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:42.860
to their own experience
or engagement

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:47.050
with 1968 and/or 2018,
before the panel moves

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:49.140
into conversation mode.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:51.520
I'll briefly introduce
the first panel of guests.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.440
More robust bios are on
the handouts in front

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.790
of you and/or the
website for this program.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.270
And I guess as -- after I
introduce you all, you can come

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.160
up and take your
labeled positions.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.690

So please join me in welcoming
our panelists to the stage

00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.320
and be ready to ask
questions and engage.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.540
Thank you very much.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.520
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Should
we sit -- should we -- no?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.820
Okay. We're good?

00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:29.120
Okay.

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.360
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: You
going to throw something at us?

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.660
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: Okay.

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.000
I guess I'm supposed to start
here, so good morning everyone.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.300
Thank you for being here.

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:46.830
Thank you, Guha, for organizing
this important symposium

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:53.080
to think about the campaign
50 years ago and, of course,

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:56.930
the impact -- initial impact,
I guess, in the late '60s

00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:58.230
and early '70s and then

00:11:58.230 --> 00:12:01.350
of course what we're
doing 50 years ago,

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:04.450
or 50 years later here in 2018

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.750
with the new Poor
People's Campaign

00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:07.790
and other actions, right?

00:12:07.790 --> 00:12:10.520
So I think that's
important to think about.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:11.910
All the activism
that has occurred

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:15.300
over the last few years,
whether it's Black Lives Matter,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.640
Occupy or Standing Iraq
or other places like,

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.280
that the Women's March.

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:24.900
So Guha asked me to do some
framing, I guess, initially,

00:12:24.900 --> 00:12:28.890
of just some larger
questions and I --

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:32.330
some threads that both
my book addresses as well

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:35.120
as just thinking about
social justice organizing

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.760
and coalition building
more generally.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.110
He also asked us
to think of what --

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.840
to address why we care
about this, right?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.870
Why do we care about
this 50 years later,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:48.940
especially as a scholar
who wasn't born

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:52.890
when the Poor People's
Campaign was going on initially.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:54.700
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Don't rub it in.

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.000
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: So sorry.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.670
Just -- I missed it by
a few years, all right?

00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:59.970
I was basically training

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:02.540
as a traditional civil rights
historian at Duke University.

00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:07.050
I wrote a master's thesis on
school desegregation in Florida,

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.720
and I -- that's kind of
where I thought I would go.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:14.450
I would tell stories about
African American activism

00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:17.410
and the coalition with whites

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:20.010
around making a more
just society.

00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.630
But what was interesting to
me and what intrigued me by --

00:13:22.630 --> 00:13:27.920
soon after I moved to
Durham, North Carolina,

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.820
was the great unease
that several generations

00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:35.970
of African American
activists in this --

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:38.870
in that city, which had a
rich tradition of activism,

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.510
both working-class through labor
organizing as well as a more

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:48.740
of a late middle-class activism,
in Durham, that unease they had

00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:51.650
with the changing political
dynamics in this city

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:54.350
because of an influx of Latinos.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:55.650
And this is something that --

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.920
of course, a phenomenon that
happened in the '80s and '90s

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.330
in the south in particular.

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:04.710
And so I started thinking,
well, what are the intersections

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.010
between Latino activism

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:08.000
and African American
activism in the '60s?

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.540
This is not something
we're usually told.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:16.050
They're stories that are siloed
in many ways, narratives that --

00:14:16.050 --> 00:14:18.550
we talk about the Chicano
Movement or the war --

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:20.530
the anti-war movement
or the women's movement

00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:22.860
or civil rights, but what
are the intersections

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.160
between all of these things?

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.440
And so that's how I got to the
book that I ended up writing

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:30.810
that focuses not just on
the Poor People's Campaign,

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.440
although that's the core of it,

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:38.780
black brown coalition
building more generally.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.080
And the -- yeah.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.970
The opportunities
there, the potential,

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:44.670
but also the obstacles to
that kind of organizing,

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.310
Caesar Chavez and Martin
Luther King Jr. often talked

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.220
about in the same breath,
but they never met.

00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.260
They interacted a couple times
through telegram and support

00:14:53.260 --> 00:14:55.970
of each other but they were
supposed to meet in March

00:14:55.970 --> 00:15:00.470
of 1968, which was cancelled
because of the fast --

00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.450
the famous fast, of course,
that Caesar Chavez had

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:09.020
and he was recovering in March,
as well as a cancellation

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.940
by Dr. King, who ended up going

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:15.810
to Memphis instead
in mid-march in '68.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.080
So that's how I came
to the campaign first,

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:23.580
and because the campaign was
not just black and white,

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.320
it was Mexican American
and Puerto Rican

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:30.370
and Native American,
even Asian American.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:34.740
And so -- and that was not how
the story had often been told.

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.780
It really was a story
that had been told really

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:42.650
as a black civil rights
campaign and something

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:47.560
that didn't really work
partially because --

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.130
mostly because Dr. King
had been assassinated.

00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:54.420
So there are several
arguments I make in the book.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:59.240
I'll just go through them very
quickly as part of the framing.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.570
One was that the campaign
is worth exploring.

00:16:01.570 --> 00:16:04.050
This is something that's worth
rehabilitating to talk about.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:06.220
It may not have been
some grand success.

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.510
Those who do write about it
and talk about it in terms

00:16:09.510 --> 00:16:11.560
of failure, and I'll
get to that in a moment,

00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.290
because it didn't
achieve its main goal,

00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:17.210
which is a rededication
to the war on poverty

00:16:17.210 --> 00:16:19.490
by the federal government,
which was declared in '64

00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.200
but never really fought,

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.570
never really funded the
way it was supposed to be.

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:26.740
Most of those resources,
of course,

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:31.050
so many resources were devoted
instead to the Vietnam War,

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:34.510
which was, of course, part
of, you know, linking poverty

00:16:34.510 --> 00:16:37.690
and war, that you can't
fight the war on poverty

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:39.490
if you're fighting
this war overseas.

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.840
And some of those
goals that were part

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.160
of that rededication the war
on poverty that were called

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.070
for was a large-scale
jobs program,

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.340
investing income maintenance
for those who didn't have jobs

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:52.880
but were working perhaps for
something other than wages,

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:57.230
and other kinds of
solutions to poverty.

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.910
There were a few policy
wins, small policy wins

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:02.100
that I'll address briefly.

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.390
Another argument that I make,
and it's important to recall,

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.970
is that economic
justice is always central

00:17:06.970 --> 00:17:09.440
to the civil rights movement
and to the freedom struggle.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:11.600
It wasn't just about
voting rights,

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.900
as important as that was.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.200
It wasn't just

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.400
about desegregating
public accommodations

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.990
like lunch counters.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:20.410
As Ella Baker says, and
I'll paraphrase her.

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:21.880
You can't -- you
know, what's the point

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.860
of desegregating a lunch
counter to be able to sit there

00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.890
if you can't afford the
coke or the hamburger

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:28.640
that you can get there.

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.050
It was really about
expanding educational

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.220
and economic opportunity
and being able to, you know,

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:37.480
the chance to make a living
and take care of your family

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.710
and be respected in
the work that you do.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:43.200
That's why King goes to
Memphis in the first place.

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:44.910
The sanitation strike that's --

00:17:44.910 --> 00:17:47.490
that, you know, started
in early February

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:51.740
of '68 epitomized the Poor
People's Campaign and everything

00:17:51.740 --> 00:17:53.480
that he was trying
to do with it.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.420
His aide said, don't go,
don't go, it's a distraction,

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.660
and he insisted on
going because it was --

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:03.250
how could he turn his back
on that and on these men?

00:18:03.250 --> 00:18:07.830
So as I said, the -- one of
the primary sort of goals

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.840
of the campaign was
jobs or income.

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:12.310
That was the slogan,
the federal jobs program

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.330
or income maintenance,
but, you know,

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:19.040
Chicano activists there had
other solutions to poverty

00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:22.700
that were around land, control
of land culture and respect

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.210
for their culture
and integration

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:27.670
of that culture in
school curriculum.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:32.160
The Native Americans were
interested in the land as well

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.690
and having autonomy
from then that --

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:37.890
from the federal
government, but also having --

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:41.150
being respected and having their
fishing rights, for instance,

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:42.450
respected, which is interesting.

00:18:42.450 --> 00:18:44.830
The Supreme Court just had
a ruling earlier this week

00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.130
about fishing rights again.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:48.510
This is -- continues to
be an issue about whether

00:18:48.510 --> 00:18:53.050
or not Natives can do what
treaties that they agreed

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:57.570
to in the middle of the 19th
century are they allowed to do

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.870
that or state authorities
and federal authorities going

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.160
to violate those treaties?

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:08.120
Native -- as Appalachian whites
also emphasized land often

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.030
around environmental
degradation.

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:13.480
Before we think about an
environmental movement being

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.710
as robust as it is
today, that was something

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.010
that they were talking about.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.960
So it wasn't just jobs
or income, but you ended

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:26.320
up having a wide range of
demands and solutions to poverty

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.950
that people brought
to Washington.

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.920
Another argument is just
about the nature of coalition

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.150
and its relation to identity.

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:38.140
We often use the term
identity politics and it's used

00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:40.610
in the public sort of
lexicon in the negative way.

00:19:40.610 --> 00:19:44.110
And I would argue that, no,
I mean you pretty much have

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:48.960
to identify with a group or be
part of a group to be able to go

00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:50.870
into coalition in
the first place.

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:56.670
So perhaps this is mutually and
these are not opposing ideas

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:57.970
of identity and coalition,

00:19:57.970 --> 00:19:59.270
but they actually
support each other.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:02.580
And so, for example, the
Chicano activists who come

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:08.170
from Los Angeles and Albuquerque
and Denver in 1968 come

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.330
to Washington and they
meet other Chicanos

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:14.250
but they also interact
with Native Americans,

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:17.270
African Americans and whites
from the west and elsewhere.

00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:22.810
And what they realize is that
it helps them sort of grow

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:24.940
in sophistication and the
analysis that they bring

00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:28.670
to their own lives, whether
it's -- it's not just about race

00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:34.160
and ethnicity but also
class and gender and region

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.880
and generation and age.

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.190
And so many of those
folks go back and it ends

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:43.580
up that the effort -- the
opportunity to go and coalesce

00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.100
and work with other
people, okay,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.230
ended up strengthening
their own movement.

00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:51.360
All the Chicano activists
that I did oral histories

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.950
with for my book,
they all pointed

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.480
to the Poor People's
Campaign and said

00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.270
that was an important
instrumental moment for them

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.570
to work with -- you know, to --

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:11.590
when they went home and
continued organizing at home.

00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:16.020
The last argument I would
say is just to suggest

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.320
that social movements
-- we need to think

00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.360
about social justice movements
in a slightly different way.

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.340
The success and failure is
not a great way to think

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.150
about them in the first place.

00:21:26.150 --> 00:21:30.210
That if we're checking, and
I read the Post every day.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.440
I live here and they always
have these winners and losers.

00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:35.900
You know, articles
about who won,

00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.070
who lost in a particular
political moment.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.370
And I read it and I --

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.480
but I always think that's just
not a productive way to think

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:46.310
about life probably, but
certainly social movements,

00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:49.920
because just because the policy
goal hasn't been achieved

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.550
doesn't mean something
hasn't been achieved

00:21:51.550 --> 00:21:53.210
in the process, right?

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.970
So for many folks who
went to Washington in '68,

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:01.760
they may not have been able --
Chicanos didn't get the Treaty

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.070
of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which
ended the Mexican War,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:06.240
reopened and renegotiated.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.730
That didn't happen.

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:09.330
What did happen is
that they had --

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.480
they built relationships
with people

00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:15.080
that they didn't otherwise
know, they found common cause

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.920
and commonalities with
white Appalachian activists

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:24.580
and disabled coal miners
who were interested in some

00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:28.370
of the same issues that they did
and Native Americans, as well,

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:31.490
from other parts of the west.

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.870
So they built relationships
with each other

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.170
that they wouldn't
otherwise have.

00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:39.790
There were some small policy
wins mostly around hunger.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:43.360
Greater food distribution
of surplus commodities

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.930
in the hundred poorest
counties in the country.

00:22:46.930 --> 00:22:49.210
Food stamps became cheaper.

00:22:49.210 --> 00:22:50.510
Income maintenance

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:53.050
or a guaranteed annual
income becomes more

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.390
of an issue that's on the table.

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:56.560
Even the Nixon administration
in '69

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.480
and '70 seriously considers
whether or not that is an option

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:06.370
and that's a way to
address the loss of jobs

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:07.670
because of automation.

00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:10.170
And so there are some
things that are --

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.100
that do occur on the policy
side, but I would argue

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:16.140
that it's not just about policy
and wins and losses but there's

00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:18.290
about some other
things going on.

00:23:18.290 --> 00:23:22.480
I will also say that that
many people that went

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.150
to Washington were
inspired by what --

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:28.820
by their experience and then
came home and ran for office.

00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.540
Ray Estiorina [assumed spelling]
runs for governor New Mexico.

00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:35.760
Many other people,
Peggy Terry in Chicago,

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.840
Flo Er [assumed spelling]
in Seattle go home and run

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:42.000
for office, become --
you know, say, well,

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.920
maybe electoral politics
has to be part of this.

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.350
It shouldn't be all
of it and I make --

00:23:47.350 --> 00:23:49.900
that's my argument
in my second book is

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:52.710
that electoral politics it's
not a silver bullet either,

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:57.400
but that maybe both things
are actually part of the mix.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:03.330
So I'll end with just a few sort
of broader questions, I guess,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:04.630
and things to think about.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.200
And the biggest one
to me, again,

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:07.720
is why should we care, right?

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.050
I mean, I'm a historian.

00:24:09.050 --> 00:24:13.910
I write about things that
I think are important

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:16.970
to not just understand in the
past but understand today.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.490
That's why historians
do what we do.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:20.570
That's why we do what we do.

00:24:20.570 --> 00:24:25.300
So, you know, why should
we care about this moment?

00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.780
What are the lessons that we can
learn from '68 and '69 and '70

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:33.110
and onward for organizing today?

00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:35.300
We are not -- this is not 1968.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:37.720
We don't have the same kind of
administration, the same kind

00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.820
of Congress, even the same
kinds of ways of communicating

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:42.240
with each other, right?

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.490
Social media is both a
blessing and a curse.

00:24:44.490 --> 00:24:49.910
And so what's -- what
can we make of --

00:24:49.910 --> 00:24:51.590
what sense can we make of that?

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:55.080
Another important one, and
one I wish I dealt with more

00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:57.530
in my book, and I think a lot
of the folks on the panel here

00:24:57.530 --> 00:24:59.820
and the next panel will
talk about a lot more,

00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.210
is this role of culture.

00:25:01.210 --> 00:25:06.200
I dabble with culture and
talk about it a little bit,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.260
but I think a more robust
discussion of, is it a barrier?

00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.630
A bridge? Both?

00:25:10.630 --> 00:25:13.880
What role does culture play
in bringing people together

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:19.210
and how do we translate
that into politics?

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:24.220
Culture is politics but into
the policy-making sort of realm.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.260
And, lastly, what do we
make of the relationship

00:25:27.260 --> 00:25:29.210
between coalition and identity?

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:32.320
You know, is it -- is identity
politics like a negative thing?

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.620
I don't think it is.

00:25:33.620 --> 00:25:37.950
I think it's actually very
healthy because I think it leads

00:25:37.950 --> 00:25:42.990
to other -- eventually it
leads to coalition inherently.

00:25:42.990 --> 00:25:45.010
So thank you so much.

00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:46.890
[ Applause ]

00:25:46.890 --> 00:25:48.390
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
Thank you, Gordon.

00:25:48.390 --> 00:25:51.590
Lenneal Henderson, and I think
I had a PowerPoint somewhere,

00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:54.130
but didn't come up.

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.430
Okay. All right.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:56.730
So I'll wing it.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:58.170
Okay. Thank you.

00:25:58.170 --> 00:25:59.470
Thank you very much.

00:25:59.470 --> 00:26:02.340
I think the inspiration
for our participation

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:03.780
in the Poor People's
Campaign came

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.220
from Martin Luther King himself
who came to the University

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:08.570
of California at
Berkeley where I was

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:09.870
in school as an undergraduate.

00:26:09.870 --> 00:26:12.190
And he came specifically

00:26:12.190 --> 00:26:14.530
to recruit some people
for this campaign.

00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:17.530
And we were impressed by the
fact that he was so short.

00:26:17.530 --> 00:26:21.230
We expected a James
Earl Jones sized guy

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:24.240
and that he was a brilliant
theologian and tactician,

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.140
but he also was a
brilliant pool player

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:29.070
and he beat us to
death and pool.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:33.730
And he used that to recruit
young men from -- to his church.

00:26:33.730 --> 00:26:36.300
He said, "If I beat you at
pool, you got to come to church

00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:40.000
and we're going to put a suit
on you and put you up front."

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.550
So he was the -- a stimulus,
and this is October of 1967.

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:47.780
And several months earlier, he
had given his famous address

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:51.810
at the Riverside
Church opposing the war,

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:54.840
an address that was actually
written by Vincent Harding.

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.670
But he too -- just to underscore
what Gordon mentioned,

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.240
mentioned his connection between
our protests against the war,

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.020
specifically the Vietnam War,
and conscription and poverty.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.180
He also pointed out that
the poverty program,

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.290
which had been enacted
in 1964, under the mantle

00:27:14.290 --> 00:27:18.360
of Economic Opportunity
Act, actually was opposed

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.200
by most mayors, white mayors in
particular, around the country,

00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:25.160
and they got it amended in 1967

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:29.090
so that it actually weakened the
maximum feasible participation

00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:32.550
provision which required
one-third of the poor to be

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:35.350
on the boards of these
community action agencies.

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:39.520
And it was underfunded, of
course, and so he wanted

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:42.580
to bring to America's
attention the fact

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:46.300
that they had a choice
going into 1968

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.680
and a presidential election
to choose a different path

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:54.900
for America than they
had been choosing before.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:59.650
He also was concerned
about the lack of focus

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:02.580
and the black power
movement on poverty.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:06.090
It was on power but not
necessarily on poverty

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:09.960
and that was kind of ironic
because part of his reason

00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:12.840
for coming to Berkeley was
to recruit young people

00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.750
who he felt had to replenish
the aging generation,

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:21.040
the previous generation in
the civil rights movement

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.450
and the Poor People's Campaign.

00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:27.020
And so part of his purpose was
to bring some young souls there,

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.130
and through the auspices
of a professor

00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:31.150
on the Berkeley campus,
we got some money

00:28:31.150 --> 00:28:35.620
from the university
itself to send 34 of us

00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:36.920
to the Poor People's Campaign.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.130
We went by Greyhound bus.

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:41.200
We decided that we
would go two months

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:44.340
or three months before the
campaign actually started

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.760
to see how these
things come together.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.800
So we actually started traveling
in March of '68 and I diverted

00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.680
to New Orleans to see my
relatives where I was born.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.240
And, of course, on April 4th,

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:58.890
Martin Luther King
was assassinated.

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.550
So my next act was to
get on the Greyhound bus

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.820
and to proceed to
Washington, DC.

00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:07.320
And when I got there, you could
see the flames and the smoke

00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.540
from all of the activity
and the rioting

00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:10.900
that was taking place
in the city.

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.650
We should also remember and
then this year, in 1968,

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:18.240
as Gordon has pointed out,

00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:23.180
we had two Civil Rights acts
enacted, one immediately

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.900
after King's assassination, and
that was the Fair Housing Act,

00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:29.060
and the other was the
Indian Civil Rights Act,

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:33.520
which covered the rights
of indigenous people

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:35.600
when they were not
on reservations.

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.990
And those were --
those two were enacted.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:41.250
We also had a major Supreme
Court decision in the case

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:45.980
of Green versus the New
Kent County, Virginia Board

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.950
of Education, which rejected
the Freedom of Choice plan

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.250
of the Board of Education.

00:29:51.250 --> 00:29:54.010
We just had a seminar on that
recently, and I mention it

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.500
because King always made
the connection in policies

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:04.050
and strategies between poverty,
housing, education, health care.

00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:08.150
He said, you couldn't
just look at the one lens.

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.450
You have to look at the --

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:12.100
how these multiple
lenses produce poverty.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.190
And he also emphasized that the
federal government was complicit

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.820
in a lot of the racial
segregation and poverty

00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:21.980
that we were witnessing because
all of the housing laws up to

00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.900
that point, especially
public housing laws,

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.320
had allowed local communities

00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.970
through their housing
authorities

00:30:28.970 --> 00:30:32.560
to enforce racial
segregation in housing.

00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.350
And then when we developed the
FHA program, it was mostly,

00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:38.530
you know, blue-collar

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:42.540
and middle-class white people
fleeing to the perimeter

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.300
of the city or the suburbs,

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:47.420
and very few black people
actually participated

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.860
in the FHA program
in its early stages,

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:54.040
which reinforced this city
suburban racial segregation.

00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.270
The other thing about 1968
that I want to emphasize

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:00.040
that my colleague Marya
will probably deal

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:03.350
with in her presentation
is the role of Washington,

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:06.600
DC itself in the Poor
People's Campaign.

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:10.140
This is five years
before home rule and so --

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:14.660
and yet the faith
community in Washington, DC,

00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:17.510
the educational community
in Washington, DC,

00:31:17.510 --> 00:31:19.850
Howard University and a number

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:23.860
of other key black
institutions are very active

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:26.490
in supporting the Poor
People's Campaign.

00:31:26.490 --> 00:31:27.790
They have students going there,

00:31:27.790 --> 00:31:30.500
as my brother Marc
will talk about.

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.740
There was actually a University
Center there which was

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:39.300
to coordinate the activities
of HBCUs who said, you know,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.660
hundreds of students to
the Poor People's Campaign.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.990
And majority institutions
like the one I attended.

00:31:43.990 --> 00:31:46.670
They weren't just
there to be interns.

00:31:46.670 --> 00:31:50.110
They actually did work and they
had to have badges and they had

00:31:50.110 --> 00:31:51.410
to have identification.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:55.770
So this was important as a part
of our socialization experience,

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:59.350
as important as any course
we took at the university.

00:31:59.350 --> 00:32:03.240
And combined with my
mother and father's activism

00:32:03.240 --> 00:32:07.810
in San Francisco against
segregation and against poverty,

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:11.630
it was part of our
inspiration to get to people

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:16.180
who were younger than we were
to get involved in the issues

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:19.070
of eradication of
poverty, etcetera.

00:32:19.070 --> 00:32:20.370
King was very astute.

00:32:20.370 --> 00:32:23.290
He said, "Look, some of the
worst segregation I've seen,

00:32:23.290 --> 00:32:26.080
some of the worst poverty
I've seen is down the street

00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.000
or around the corner from
major university campuses

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.080
in university towns
like Berkeley."

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:33.390
And he was absolutely right.

00:32:33.390 --> 00:32:36.680
Two blocks from the campus
was McKinley High School

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:39.880
where they dumped all of
the undesirable, you know,

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:43.170
students at the high
school level

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:45.790
and they were mostly black.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:47.090
And so --

00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:48.390
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:49.810
No. I went there -- I went
there to teach actually.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:51.110
I went there to teach.

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:52.410
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Just teasing.

00:32:52.410 --> 00:32:53.710
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
When we came back

00:32:53.710 --> 00:32:55.500
from the Poor People's
Campaign, we decided that one

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.580
of our legacies would be to work

00:32:57.580 --> 00:33:00.550
on something called the McKinley
Project, which is to work

00:33:00.550 --> 00:33:02.890
with those students
at that school.

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:06.730
And so there are many,
many multiple legacies,

00:33:06.730 --> 00:33:08.400
as Gordon has pointed out here,

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:11.160
and one of them is not only
policy, but all the movements

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:13.500
that were spawned by the
Poor People's Campaign.

00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.370
I remember a very young
Marian Wright Edelman,

00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:19.450
just out of Yale Law
School, just passed the bar,

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.320
Lawyers Committee on Civil
Rights, right over there

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.030
on Jefferson Place, and
she was getting involved

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:27.000
in the Poor People's Campaign,
supporting their work.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000
And, of course, now she
is the iconic leader

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.780
of the Children's Defense Fund.

00:33:31.780 --> 00:33:35.000
And I can name about 15 or
20 different organizations

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.550
that grow -- grew directly
out of the involvement

00:33:38.550 --> 00:33:40.750
of those individuals in
the Poor People's Campaign.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:45.160
So the links between 1968
and now are tangible,

00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.350
they're strong, and
they're continuing,

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:51.160
and I'm really delighted to
see under the new leadership

00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:54.470
of our two reverends here,
the new Poor People's Campaign

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:57.510
and I urge all of
us the support this.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:04.250
[ Applause ]

00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:05.560
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: I'm Marc
Steiner it's a pleasure

00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.110
to be here, and I'll
make this brief as well.

00:34:08.110 --> 00:34:12.060
And I was asked to talk about
how I got involved and what

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.330
that moment was like so
maybe hit those two things.

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:17.050
So in 1968, I had
already been involved

00:34:17.050 --> 00:34:18.350
in civil rights movement
for nine years,

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.040
in the movement for nine years.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:22.830
I walked my first picket
line when I was 13.

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:26.130
At 15, I was arrested and beaten
really badly by the police

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:28.800
in Cambridge, Maryland
when I was working

00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.450
with Gloria Richardson
in [inaudible].

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:34.880
And so I joined the anti-war
movement, was a big part

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.280
of that, was part of the
underground that movement,

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:39.010
making false identities
for people to get them

00:34:39.010 --> 00:34:44.210
out of the country to Canada
and Sweden who were GIs

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:47.090
or people dodging the
draft -- not dodging.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:49.040
Refusing to serve in Vietnam.

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.800
I was drafted in '67 so there
was this sort of that --

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.280
at any rate, that was my
background immediately,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:56.900
and so I was in the movement.

00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:02.740
In '68, January '68 I was
in Cuba, and when I got back

00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:04.370
from Cuba, I was
with the students

00:35:04.370 --> 00:35:06.480
from Democratic Society.

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.780
I got back from Cuba.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.570
I kind of broke with a lot of
my brothers and sisters at SDS

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:12.870
at that point because
they wanted

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:15.380
to overthrow the government,
which we all wanted

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.790
to do back then, and
blow up buildings.

00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:20.030
I said, no, we need to
organize among the poor.

00:35:20.030 --> 00:35:22.850
Then we can blow up buildings
and overthrow the government.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:28.010
And so because we, at
that moment, in 1968,

00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:31.150
if you were in the middle
of things, we had a sense

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.580
that a revolution was going on,

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:34.820
and we actually thought
revolution was going to happen.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.420
Here, when you saw
what's happening

00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.540
in West Africa was happening
in -- all through Latin America

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:42.460
and Cuba, the Vietnamese
resistance, the Americans,

00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.340
all that combined,
people really thought

00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:45.650
that we were in this moment.

00:35:45.650 --> 00:35:49.540
And so that was very
real for people.

00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:53.890
So but I left because I also
had relations with the folks

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:56.070
who became the young
Patriots in Chicago.

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:01.280
And the young Patriots were
an Appalachian white group

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:03.360
of people, Peggy
Terry, Doug Youngblood

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.430
and others, in Chicago.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:08.090
They came mostly from
Appalachian, northern Alabama,

00:36:08.090 --> 00:36:10.830
northern Georgia, the southern
parts the Appalachian Mountains,

00:36:10.830 --> 00:36:14.700
and lived in Chicago and
in the uptown neighborhood.

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.870
And they were the -- what
they organized was tantamount

00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:20.110
to the white version of
the Black Panther Party,

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:22.650
which was the Young
Patriot Party.

00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:26.970
And so when I came back from
Cuba, and I already been hanging

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:29.210
out with these guys a lot,
and I loved Peggy Terry

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.130
and she was like a mother to me.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:36.230
And so and Doug -- and her son,
Doug, who had been in the Klan,

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.720
as was Peggy's father,
and he had done six years

00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.990
in Alabama state
prison for manslaughter

00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:46.180
and was what we called
back in the day one

00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:50.740
of the great hillbilly poets
and was until he passed away.

00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:55.020
And we said about working with
the Poor People's Campaign

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:56.670
to organize poor
white communities

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.120
to join the Poor
People's Campaign.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.880
And so we lived in the city.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.240
I lived in Washington
at that time.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.930
I had an apartment on
P Street, as I said,

00:37:05.930 --> 00:37:09.530
somebody earlier,
was $90 a month.

00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:13.860
It became one of the rest
centers for the people

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.060
in the movement with the
Poor People's Campaign.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.200
But so we organized all through
Chicago, Ohio, Appalachia,

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:23.270
getting people to
come in to be part

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.020
of the Poor People's Campaign.

00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:26.320
And think about this.

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:27.790
Given what we're doing
with monuments now,

00:37:27.790 --> 00:37:29.350
which I don't disagree with,

00:37:29.350 --> 00:37:31.860
Confederate monuments I'm
talking about, that the patch

00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:37.930
that the young patriots wore
was a Dixie flag with a fist

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:42.650
on the dungaree jackets
and leather jackets.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:46.120
We flew the Dixie flag
in resurrection city

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:52.300
in our encampment, and it
was very complex but we did.

00:37:52.300 --> 00:38:00.580
And so that movement continued
after we left in '68 and kept

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:03.000
on organizing in Chicago and
kept on organizing around.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.680
And one of the things
I think is --

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:06.930
well, I'll get to this
-- that in a minute.

00:38:06.930 --> 00:38:10.610
But so the place itself, let
me give it a little piece

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:14.020
of history I think is important
that I didn't learn until later

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.910
because when King died, we
were all deeply affected.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:21.560
Though I was part of the
movement with Gloria Richardson

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:24.370
in Cambridge and later in other
places that didn't want King

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:26.760
to come, we said, "We got this.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.060
We don't need you here."

00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:31.340
There was a real
split in many ways.

00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:36.260
And it wasn't until after he
was assassinated and I began

00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:38.870
to realize his speech at
Riverside that took place

00:38:38.870 --> 00:38:41.950
that I had read and knew
about and all the other things

00:38:41.950 --> 00:38:44.110
that were going on
connected anti-war movement,

00:38:44.110 --> 00:38:48.160
King began to change
and evolve as well.

00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:50.940
And so when King's
assassination --

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:52.830
well, maybe I'll
step back first.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.860
So you mentioned Marian
Wright, then Marian Wright,

00:38:54.860 --> 00:38:56.160
now Marian Wright Edelman.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:02.370
So when Peter Edelman and Bobby
Kennedy went to Mississippi

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:05.110
and all through the
poor areas of America,

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:06.410
they met Marian Wright.

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:09.120
And Marian Wright and Peter --
that's where they fell in love

00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.650
and then they -- and they went

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.310
to visit Bobby Kennedy
one day in Washington, DC.

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:16.650
And he was swimming in a
swimming pool apparently

00:39:16.650 --> 00:39:19.730
after they had breakfast,
and he stopped and said,

00:39:19.730 --> 00:39:21.660
"What we need is a poor
people is moving in America

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.080
to take over Washington."

00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.950
And Marion Wright said,
"That's a brilliant idea."

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.310
The next day, she was
supposed to have a meeting

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.610
with Martin Luther King.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.920
She did and she said, "King,

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:35.450
this is what Bobby
Kennedy said."

00:39:35.450 --> 00:39:37.290
And King went, "That's
what we're going to do.

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:38.590
That's where it started."

00:39:38.590 --> 00:39:39.890
Most people don't realize that.

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:43.800
And I've been thinking a lot
about what it would have meant

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:45.540
if Bobby Kennedy was
not assassinated.

00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:48.130
Even though he was not my
favorite person at the time,

00:39:48.130 --> 00:39:50.920
I've come to respect him
since to understand his --

00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.360
also how he evolved and
who he became before he was

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:56.330
assassinated and taken from us.

00:39:56.330 --> 00:40:00.560
And King and Bobby Kennedy
started becoming close before

00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.630
King was assassinated.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:04.650
Just imagine if Kennedy
was elected president

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:07.860
of the United States and his
closest confidant was Martin

00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:09.160
Luther King.

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.660
So, for me, that's a lesson

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.450
about what we should be
thinking about today.

00:40:13.450 --> 00:40:17.950
Not what could have been, but
what we can build now, right?

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:22.350
So going -- so going
back to the camp.

00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:24.590
So I lived in Resurrection City

00:40:24.590 --> 00:40:29.400
and Resurrection
City was a mess.

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:32.650
It was disorganized and chaotic.

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:34.650
There's no question about it.

00:40:34.650 --> 00:40:37.180
And I didn't think about this
until I interviewed Maria Varela

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:39.530
for the African American Museum

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:41.760
in for the poor people's
exhibit here.

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:46.780
And Maria was a Latina
woman, a Chicano who --

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.260
from Chicago, who was

00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:49.690
in the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee

00:40:49.690 --> 00:40:51.780
in the south for like six years.

00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:53.160
She lived in the
midst of that --

00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:57.640
the war in the south
because it was a war.

00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:02.850
And she said to me that
when you think about it,

00:41:02.850 --> 00:41:06.010
the men around King
were suffering

00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:07.790
from post-traumatic stress.

00:41:07.790 --> 00:41:09.510
We all were in the
civil rights movement.

00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:11.580
Anybody who walked within the
civil rights movement suffered

00:41:11.580 --> 00:41:13.110
from that because, you know, you
didn't know if you were going

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:16.860
to live or die every day and you
were beaten severely by police.

00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:19.060
It was not a joke.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:23.520
And so they saw the man
who was their leader gunned

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.990
down in front of them,
beaten to death on a balcony,

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:28.610
and then they took
up the mantle to try

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:32.380
to create Resurrection City
and the Poor People's Campaign.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:34.660
King's idea for that campaign
was there should be massive

00:41:34.660 --> 00:41:37.220
civil disobedience all
through Washington.

00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.850
Take over the city
and shut it down,

00:41:38.850 --> 00:41:40.980
which is what --
that was his idea.

00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:45.540
So it was a very chaotic time.

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:47.270
So the camp itself was a mess.

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:51.150
I mean, to live in and the
mud and everything else.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.160
But it's like Jean T. O'Hara
[assumed spelling] said --

00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.000
I love the type something
[inaudible] for a book,

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.480
which is -- it was -- let
me get this right because.

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.370
It was terrible and beautiful,
the civil rights movement,

00:42:02.370 --> 00:42:03.790
because it was terrible
and beautiful,

00:42:03.790 --> 00:42:05.970
as a movement always is.

00:42:05.970 --> 00:42:11.690
And so like when the --
when the Latinos arrived

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.510
from the West Coast, there
was no place for them

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.130
in Resurrection City, so they
moved to Hawthorne School,

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.730
which is where they lived.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.830
Now, Latinos and some black
folks, some white folks,

00:42:20.830 --> 00:42:24.530
and some Native folks live there
and the Native contingents came,

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.000
they ended up in
Episcopal housing

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.300
and did not really live --

00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:29.320
most of them did not live
in Resurrection City,

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:31.110
which is mostly blacks
and whites.

00:42:31.110 --> 00:42:32.570
And some -- and Puerto Ricans.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:33.870
It was -- so it was a very --

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:35.240
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler:
Some Native Americans.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.330
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: Some Native
Americans but most of them were

00:42:37.330 --> 00:42:39.050
in the Episcopal house.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:40.930
And so I'm just saying
this so there was --

00:42:40.930 --> 00:42:43.060
there was real separate
things were going on

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.790
and it wasn't coordinated
well at all.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:48.310
As a matter of fact, there was
a time when we actually stormed

00:42:48.310 --> 00:42:51.120
into the hotel where Abernathy

00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:54.800
and those folks were
staying -- you were there.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.320
So we stormed into the hotel.

00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.620
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
Good steak.

00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.230
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: Right, exactly.

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:01.840
So we're eating --
you know, in the --

00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.400
we're in the mud
eating beans and they're

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:07.370
up there eating stake and
so we surrounded Abernathy

00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:08.800
and those guys saying,
what the hell are you --

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.100
what is this, man?

00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:11.400
You're eating steak
in here in the mud?

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.350
You need to get the hell out of
here and come back in the mud.

00:43:13.350 --> 00:43:14.650
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
That's right.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:17.530
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: So we were
pissed and so there was --

00:43:17.530 --> 00:43:20.430
there were all kinds of
divides taking place.

00:43:20.430 --> 00:43:24.310
So having shared that, though,
there was a beauty in the spot.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.440
The beauty had to do with
the people themselves,

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.480
the interaction between the
organizers and poor people,

00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:32.400
the interactions and the music.

00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:35.410
I mean, whether your
soundtrack was soul music,

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:38.700
whether your soundtrack
was country music,

00:43:38.700 --> 00:43:40.210
whether your soundtrack
was rock,

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.380
whatever your soundtrack was,
there was a power and beauty

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.140
to what that was and we
played it and we danced

00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:48.140
and we ate together and we hung
out together and there was --

00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:50.880
and there was a real
communion going on.

00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.670
There's power and beauty
in what was going on.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.990
And when people left
Resurrection City,

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:57.860
almost everybody, as
Gordon was alluding to,

00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.710
ended up going back
home to organize.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.910
So even if they didn't have --
even if the goals were not met,

00:44:03.910 --> 00:44:06.400
half-a-million new houses to be
built until poverty was ended,

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:10.150
35 million dollars to be
invested in ending poverty

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:14.570
in America every year until it
was ended, guaranteed income

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:17.780
or a job will guarantee
the income.

00:44:17.780 --> 00:44:19.870
Those are some the demands
that came out of King,

00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:21.360
that came out of
Resurrection City

00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.360
and the Poor People's Campaign.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.670
Even though they were
met, people went home

00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:26.720
and they organized
and began to organize

00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.320
in their communities
building a movement.

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.590
And people came back and became
Panthers and they came back

00:44:31.590 --> 00:44:34.680
and they became organizers
in Chicago and San Francisco,

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.770
in Mississippi, everywhere.

00:44:36.770 --> 00:44:39.010
So there was a power
in that, as well,

00:44:39.010 --> 00:44:40.310
and I think there are lessons.

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:42.610
Now, I'll quote thirty
seconds here,

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:45.850
that there's lesson
for us now in 2018.

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:48.560
What the new Poor People's
Campaign is doing is

00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:49.860
really important.

00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.870
The difference between today

00:44:51.870 --> 00:44:56.460
and then is what made the
Poor People's Campaign work,

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.090
what made Resurrection City
happened, was because it came

00:44:59.090 --> 00:45:03.290
out of people who are actually
organizing in communities.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.330
So we were organizing in poor
white communities, we were --

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.670
people were organizing on
the res, people organizing

00:45:08.670 --> 00:45:12.190
in the barrio, people were
organizing in the ghetto,

00:45:12.190 --> 00:45:14.880
as we call our places back then.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.850
And that's what it came
-- and that's how that --

00:45:16.850 --> 00:45:19.430
and that has to happen now
if there's real change,

00:45:19.430 --> 00:45:21.120
because when we see these
numbers that came up earlier

00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:24.540
in this film about how many
poor people in America,

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.770
close to double that number.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.550
We use numbers to define
poverty that we created,

00:45:29.550 --> 00:45:32.870
that were created in the 1960s
to define what poverty means.

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:34.580
Poverty means something
much different now.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.150
There are more people
in poverty now

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.660
than those numbers that we saw.

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.030
America is on the edge.

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.330
People are on the edge.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:43.550
It's going to take organizing
to pull people together to make

00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:44.850
that change and that's --

00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:48.150
we can learn that from
our experiences back then.

00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.530
That's what young
people are doing.

00:45:55.370 --> 00:45:57.420
So thank you.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.560
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: This -- okay.

00:46:00.560 --> 00:46:05.600
So I'm going to try and give
a broad but brief overview

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.650
of what -- how we've
approached this history

00:46:07.650 --> 00:46:10.610
at the public library
this past year.

00:46:10.610 --> 00:46:12.770
I want to start by just
saying that I'm a co-founder

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:16.400
of Oak Hill Center for Education
and Culture in Baltimore.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.660
We're located in East Baltimore.

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.070
it's a cultural center and
social movement school and most

00:46:22.070 --> 00:46:25.850
of what we -- our work is
focused on is the role of arts

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:27.510
and culture and political
education

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:29.610
in movement organizing.

00:46:29.610 --> 00:46:30.910
So we've been -- myself

00:46:30.910 --> 00:46:34.930
and my collaborators there have
been involved in conversations

00:46:34.930 --> 00:46:36.920
around relaunching the
Poor People's Campaign

00:46:36.920 --> 00:46:38.800
for a number of years.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.010
So coming to the DC Public
Library this past year

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:45.290
and being presented
with the question

00:46:45.290 --> 00:46:48.810
of how the library could
celebrate the 50th anniversary

00:46:48.810 --> 00:46:53.670
of 1968 was kind of a
unique opportunity, right?

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:59.990
So one of the first
questions that kind of popped

00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:04.070
up in my mind was, what are
the public library's values

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:08.480
and how can it contribute to
a national dialogue and debate

00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:12.690
around what our values
are as a nation, right?

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:19.040
So the People's University
Project is --

00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:22.690
it came out of a conversations
with the library foundation

00:47:22.690 --> 00:47:27.030
and we set out to accomplish
a few things initially.

00:47:27.030 --> 00:47:30.160
The Martin Luther King
Jr. Library is closed

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:34.690
for renovations until 2020,
so we wanted to uplift

00:47:34.690 --> 00:47:36.830
and increase visibility of
programming and services

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:41.230
of smaller [inaudible] branches,
utilize library collections

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:43.610
and complementary collections
of partner institutions

00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:47.630
to connect this history to
the context of today, right?

00:47:47.630 --> 00:47:50.990
Emphasize the library's
commitment to the legacy

00:47:50.990 --> 00:47:54.450
of Dr. King and his work
and put the library forward

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:58.150
as not solely a repository for
information but a potential site

00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:59.450
for cultural production as well.

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:04.110
So the focus on the Poor
People's Campaign became kind

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:07.390
of an obvious direction to go,

00:48:07.390 --> 00:48:09.640
but then the big question was
how do we -- how do we do that?

00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.700
I mean, this history is so big

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:13.680
of just listening
to the stories here.

00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:16.120
I mean, there's so much to it.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.700
So we looked a lot at this this
idea of cultural production

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.400
and thought, well, how about
we focus on cultural aspects

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.940
of the campaign and
Resurrection City?

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:27.600
The three that we
identified to work

00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.070
with were Poor People's
University,

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:33.490
which was a political
education university project

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:37.630
that Resurrection City adopted,
the Many Races Soul Center,

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:41.050
which I'm going to
explain more here shortly,

00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.350
and the Hunger Wall Mural.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:46.780
And the Hunger Wall Mural was a
large mural in Resurrection City

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:49.250
where it kind of became like
a visual kind of soapbox

00:48:49.250 --> 00:48:50.620
where people could
share their experiences

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:52.390
of poverty and oppression.

00:48:52.390 --> 00:48:54.150
And it was a -- sort

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.220
of a cultural activity
to build solidarity.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:02.740
So as we thought about how
these three things might be

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.690
represented, it became
really apparent quickly

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:09.960
that the library itself is
really a people's university

00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:11.260
of its own.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:12.560
So we've really made -- we made

00:49:12.560 --> 00:49:14.870
that the overarching
theme for the year.

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:19.540
I want to mention actually
that the more we --

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.780
I think about this, I think
it's important to mention.

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.290
Public libraries are a
really interesting space.

00:49:25.290 --> 00:49:28.910
Their relationship to
poverty is very unique,

00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:32.520
so as we see other
public institutions kind

00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.800
of collapsing before us, public
school systems, for example,

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.750
the library often
picks up the slack.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:43.180
And working with
public librarians

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.540
around these themes has really
revealed that they do a lot more

00:49:46.540 --> 00:49:48.280
than just how people
check out books.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.150
I mean, these are essentially
social workers, right?

00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:57.530
So the second cultural aspect

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.330
of Resurrection City
was the Soul Tent,

00:49:59.330 --> 00:50:01.050
the Many Races Soul
Center or Soul Tent.

00:50:01.050 --> 00:50:04.240
We had a sweet scale --

00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.260
had a fabricated version
of a scaled-down replica

00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:12.560
of a Resurrection
City tent outfitted

00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:14.250
with audio and video components.

00:50:14.250 --> 00:50:16.340
Maggie's going to talk more
about this in a second.

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:19.160
But it's currently touring
library branches and sort

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.090
of acting as a representation,

00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:25.660
a way of celebrating the
Many Races Soul Center.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.570
So before I start this,

00:50:27.570 --> 00:50:31.650
the hunger wall we approached
a little differently.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:36.360
Rather than a mural, we were
inspired by a poster project

00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:39.120
by the Just Seeds
Art Collective.

00:50:39.120 --> 00:50:42.920
And they had created
a portfolio of posters

00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:44.970
for the new Poor
People's Campaign,

00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:48.540
so we assembled a group of
artists, a local artist in DC,

00:50:48.540 --> 00:50:53.630
and using those posters,
items from Special Collections

00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:56.280
at the DC Public Library,
Library of Congress,

00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:59.410
and educational materials from
the Poor People's Campaign,

00:50:59.410 --> 00:51:01.310
we held a all-day workshop.

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:03.740
And we worked with those artists
to kind of like, you know,

00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.810
explore the history and
think about, you know,

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.260
what could we -- how could
we create a DC portfolio

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.690
of Poor People's
Campaign posters today?

00:51:11.690 --> 00:51:13.700
So they created the --

00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:18.630
a new portfolio and there's a
little video show on it here

00:51:18.630 --> 00:51:21.910
and then -- well, we'll
see how this goes.

00:51:21.910 --> 00:51:24.170
The Hunger Wall Poster
Project commemorates the 50th

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:27.740
anniversary of 1968 and the Poor
People's Campaign, which brought

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:32.190
over 50,000 protesters to DC
to demand an end to poverty.

00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:35.190
The original hunger wall, the
inspiration for this project,

00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:36.740
was a mural on a plywood wall

00:51:36.740 --> 00:51:39.230
in the encampment known
as Resurrection City.

00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:40.920
We wanted to challenge artists

00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.400
to reimagine this
artwork for 2018.

00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.280
The artists saw the
importance of speaking

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:49.190
to the local perspective of what
Dr. King called The Triplets

00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:53.230
of Evil -- poverty, war
and militarism, and racism.

00:51:53.230 --> 00:51:55.330
They made posters on
these topics and the topic

00:51:55.330 --> 00:51:57.210
of ecological destruction,
which is a focus

00:51:57.210 --> 00:51:58.920
of the campaign today.

00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:01.090
A second phase of the project
was inviting the community

00:52:01.090 --> 00:52:02.390
to respond to the issues

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:04.250
of the Poor People's
Campaign at poster workshops.

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:05.550
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:08.830
People who visited neighborhood
libraries, who participated

00:52:08.830 --> 00:52:14.150
in programming were invited
to create posters of their own

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.860
that address social and
political and cultural issues

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:19.760
that affected them directly.

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.240
And like 50 years before,
they were [inaudible]

00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:25.540
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: Sorry.

00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.840
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:29.490
On a wall that collectively
says something

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.430
about our community today.

00:52:31.430 --> 00:52:35.260
I think it's direct
engagement, it is story sharing,

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.930
it's getting people from
different generations to look

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:42.080
at a moment in history
with new eyes.

00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:44.140
It gets them to tell
their own stories.

00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.250
I think it's an excellent
way for us

00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:49.940
to connect communities
to our collections.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:56.610
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: So out
of that, actually,

00:52:56.610 --> 00:52:59.060
eventually a mural didn't
come out of the project.

00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:05.270
But what's important really for,
you know, my two roles is one is

00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:07.430
as an organizer and the
other others as a curator.

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.490
And so it's been great
to have the library space

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:13.410
to educate people
about the campaign

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:17.510
and to really activate these
collections in creative ways.

00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:21.580
But what's really amazing
and rewarding for me is

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:25.400
that this image is --
you'll see, one side,

00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:26.730
it's a wheat pasted wall.

00:53:26.730 --> 00:53:28.310
That's a library project, right?

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:33.980
The other image is an
electrical box that we didn't --

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:35.280
we didn't put posters on it

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:39.250
and that's the Poor People's
Campaign using these posters

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:40.880
for their own purposes, right?

00:53:40.880 --> 00:53:42.460
And so that's -- that
idea that the work

00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.100
that we're creating is
actually then being taken

00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.700
out into the world
and actually used

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.060
in movement organizing is really
important to me personally,

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.920
and it's been great to build,
you know, through the project

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:55.710
and educating people
about this history.

00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:57.580
Some of the artists who have
gotten involved are now working

00:53:57.580 --> 00:53:59.330
directly with the campaign.

00:53:59.330 --> 00:54:02.670
And that's just -- it's
just an incredible outcome.

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:06.830
So I'm going to let Maggie
talk more about this.

00:54:06.830 --> 00:54:08.360
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: Hi.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.500
My name is Maggie
Gilmore so I'm going

00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:13.630
to bring the librarian
perspective here.

00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.580
And it is an honor to be here.

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:20.300
Thank you for inviting
me to be participant.

00:54:20.300 --> 00:54:24.770
I worked as a music librarian
at the MLK Jr. Memorial Library,

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.530
which is now closed
for modernization,

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.870
and I booked shows for
the DC Punk Archive.

00:54:30.870 --> 00:54:34.080
We did punk shows in the
basement and as well as carrying

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:37.490
on traditions of chamber
music and jazz series.

00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:43.100
So with the closure of MLK,
I have a unique opportunity

00:54:43.100 --> 00:54:47.350
to participate in this
project and was selected

00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:52.290
to be a MICA Fellow,
which is a really exciting

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:55.530
and unique direction that
the library has taken

00:54:55.530 --> 00:54:59.690
in allowing library staff who,
you know, we work day to day

00:54:59.690 --> 00:55:02.520
at a reference desk
and do various tasks,

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.290
but to give us this opportunity

00:55:04.290 --> 00:55:10.120
to explore curatorial
practice is incredibly valuable

00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:11.420
moving forward.

00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:15.420
And you were talking a little
bit about identity politics and,

00:55:15.420 --> 00:55:18.560
you know, the public library
space is definitely evaluating

00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.840
our identity.

00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:24.160
We have a new -- we are going
to have a new central library

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:31.120
in 2020, so we are looking at
how we display our collections,

00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:36.040
how they are accessible to the
public and all of the services

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.620
that we provide, like,
what is the core?

00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:43.150
What is the root of
what we are doing?

00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:48.860
So in looking at the
collections that we have

00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:53.870
at the DC Public Library
and being a music librarian

00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:56.900
and interested in the
music at Resurrection City,

00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.600
these were two of my favorites.

00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:02.080
So we have the Poor People's
Campaign collection of our own

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:04.900
at DC Public Library in
our special collections.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:08.830
And let me just take one moment
to introduce Carrie Williams,

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.720
the director of Special
Collections

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.590
at DC Public Library.

00:56:12.590 --> 00:56:14.730
Want to give us a little wave.

00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:19.350
You'll see her face
in a video also soon.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:23.460
So we digitized this
collection this year,

00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.680
so it's now accessible
to the public online.

00:56:26.680 --> 00:56:29.830
In addition to these two
song books that you see,

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:35.850
we also have papers, documents
from the activism and the work

00:56:35.850 --> 00:56:38.570
that they were doing with
the Poor People's Campaign.

00:56:38.570 --> 00:56:42.080
There are newsletters that were
published in Resurrection City

00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:44.620
with wonderful poetry
and dialogue

00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:47.620
about what was going
on and who was there.

00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:51.600
This particular one
on your left is

00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:56.900
from Edward Haycraft who's
credited with a Chi-Lites song

00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:59.790
from the early '70s
but that's about it.

00:56:59.790 --> 00:57:04.400
And so this is a book that
has just wonderful lyrics

00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:08.290
that he wrote in
Resurrection City presumably.

00:57:08.290 --> 00:57:13.610
So we actually have duplicated
it and we give out copies.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:16.560
I've handed out, I don't
know, way over 100 of these

00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:22.240
through the project, so allowing
the public to see, you know,

00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.610
and handle ephemera is a little
bit new for our library system.

00:57:26.610 --> 00:57:30.410
And how do we actually put these
collections out into the world?

00:57:30.410 --> 00:57:32.740
And how will people
utilize them?

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:37.440
Was an important question
that we have been asking.

00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:42.100
The core songbook actually is
from like 1963 or '64, but,

00:57:42.100 --> 00:57:43.810
you know, it was
utilized for years

00:57:43.810 --> 00:57:47.200
and still being circulated
at Resurrection City.

00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:50.040
So that's interesting.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.980
And then through
the MICA Project,

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:56.450
we were given the opportunity
to come here to the Library

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.310
of Congress, connect
with Guha and John Fenn,

00:57:59.310 --> 00:58:04.270
and we met about what the
Library of Congress is doing

00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:07.840
at the American Folklife Center
and had a wonderful workshop

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:12.540
with them and also learned about
the Bruce Jackson collections.

00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:16.510
So Bruce Jackson, also in
the audience here today,

00:58:16.510 --> 00:58:20.900
has donated photographs and
a collection of recordings

00:58:20.900 --> 00:58:23.400
to the Library of
Congress Folklife Center.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:27.720
And so this was another
unique opportunity

00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:30.910
for the DC Public Library
and the Library of Congress

00:58:30.910 --> 00:58:33.610
to begin a partnership and look

00:58:33.610 --> 00:58:37.810
at how we can support
each other moving forward.

00:58:37.810 --> 00:58:41.630
So looking at --
these are just images

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:47.300
from Bruce Jackson's tapes,
and he had a collection of dubs

00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:50.050
from the Ralph Rinzler
recordings that were done

00:58:50.050 --> 00:58:52.860
at Resurrection City
in the Soul Tent,

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:57.730
or the Many Races Soul Center
as it was originally called.

00:58:57.730 --> 00:59:01.210
So we -- in conceptualizing,
okay,

00:59:01.210 --> 00:59:06.130
so we have these physical
pieces, song books, papers,

00:59:06.130 --> 00:59:10.010
photographs, and then we
have audio, and what do we do

00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:13.400
to put these things together
and how do we present this

00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:22.570
to the public and conceptualized
the structure of the Soul Tent.

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:24.520
But first we're going
to listen a little bit

00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:25.820
to some of the recordings.

00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:29.490
I just pieced together a
short clip to give you a sense

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.940
of the variety of
what's in the recordings,

00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:35.440
because not only are
there wonderful songs

00:59:35.440 --> 00:59:39.730
from like Elizabeth Cotton, who
lived here in Washington, DC,

00:59:39.730 --> 00:59:44.700
but also just kind
of social banter.

00:59:44.700 --> 00:59:47.850
And you catch a lot of how
people were interacting

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:50.390
with each other from
what they say.

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:54.940
Comedy routines, just --
and just wonderful speeches

00:59:54.940 --> 01:00:00.170
and a diversity of
performers at the Soul Tent.

01:00:00.170 --> 01:00:03.040
It was kind of like an
open mic session often.

01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:06.710
There were all kinds of
people just stepping up

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.890
and making their voice heard,

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:11.390
which they probably
didn't have an opportunity

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.490
to do all that often.

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.740
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
We already noticed

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:19.940
about this program is that what
you're seeing are living pages

01:00:19.940 --> 01:00:25.080
of history right here
before your eyes,

01:00:26.310 --> 01:00:31.810
right here before your ears,
and right here in your nostrils,

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:37.510
just like the mud that
switches up around your feet.

01:00:37.510 --> 01:01:17.410
[ Music ]

01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:20.350
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Brothers and sisters,

01:01:20.350 --> 01:01:25.840
we are all gathered here tonight
for the same cause and it's nice

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.650
to see each and every
one of you happy tonight.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:35.020
And we are glad to be
here with all of you.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.490
I am from South Dakota,
from the Black Hills

01:01:39.490 --> 01:01:43.740
of South Dakota and
the Badlands.

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:45.540
And --

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:48.040
[ Applause ]

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:52.350
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I'm from Detroit.

01:01:52.350 --> 01:01:53.650
That's another Badland.

01:01:53.650 --> 01:01:54.950
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

01:01:54.950 --> 01:02:01.790
And I went up to the interior
department to speak my piece

01:02:01.790 --> 01:02:08.500
in behalf of my badlands,
which was taken away

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:14.290
from us during the World
War, number two that is.

01:02:14.290 --> 01:02:16.070
And, no, not number three.

01:02:16.070 --> 01:02:22.510
So I guess we are all here for
the same cause and we hope.

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:27.510
[ Applause ]

01:02:27.510 --> 01:03:22.510
[ Music ]

01:03:22.510 --> 01:03:29.070
[ Applause ]

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:36.420
And then we have 45
minutes of the thunderstorm.

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:38.510
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
I remember that one.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:43.070
[ Laughter ]

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.930
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: So that
gives you a little bit of sense

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:48.310
of the recordings that we have
the privilege to work with

01:03:48.310 --> 01:03:50.000
and present to the public.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:53.130
And now in the DC
Public Library, you know,

01:03:53.130 --> 01:03:56.340
we interact with the poor
and the low-income residents

01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.800
of Washington, DC
every single day.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:04.040
And we do provide a gamut
of services in order

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:08.640
to support our local
population here.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:12.080
So I think it was
really important for me

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.070
to bring this history into
the public libraries space

01:04:16.070 --> 01:04:19.790
and then this is kind of get
a sense of what it looks like.

01:04:19.790 --> 01:04:23.860
The structure that we built
based on the [inaudible]

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:26.460
and Howard University
students designs,

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:33.320
is kind of like an
open A frame structure

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.550
and there is a listening
station, there is photographs

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:40.330
on display from Bruce
Jackson as well

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:42.890
as the Washington Evening
Star photograph collection

01:04:42.890 --> 01:04:46.390
that we have at the DC Public
Library, also digitized,

01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:49.270
1968 photos this year.

01:04:49.270 --> 01:04:53.270
And then, you know,
handouts, giveaways,

01:04:53.270 --> 01:04:57.100
and we've wheat pasted
posters, some of the posters

01:04:57.100 --> 01:05:01.140
that Nick had shown you
earlier as well as like pieces

01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:05.720
from our collections and
copies from our collection.

01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:10.330
And we have a collection of
actual books people can check

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:13.500
out also, including, I think,
Power to the Poor was one

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.360
of the first to be checked out.

01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:20.390
We do have books still.

01:05:20.390 --> 01:05:24.510
And it's opportunity to engage

01:05:24.510 --> 01:05:27.190
with people who have
the stories.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:30.120
So we have collections that
tell a story but the residents

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.120
of Washington, DC also
have stories and that's --

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.270
was another goal of the project
was to bring those people to us

01:05:37.270 --> 01:05:41.950
and use photographs
to jog the memory

01:05:41.950 --> 01:05:45.360
and get their stories started.

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.860
So this has been a
wonderful opportunity.

01:05:46.860 --> 01:05:50.460
We have all kinds of people
talking to us about their gamut

01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:54.080
of experiences, the woman who
made sandwiches and brought them

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:56.260
to Resurrection City, a
woman who brought blankets

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:59.100
to Resurrection City,
again, speaks to the support

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:02.420
that Washington, DC gave
to Resurrection City.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:06.260
And there's a video but we are
not going to play it because --

01:06:06.260 --> 01:06:07.560
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
We're here at the Anacostia.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.860
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore:
We are out of time.

01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:10.660
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: Let's
watch it [inaudible]

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:15.060
[ Laughter ]

01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.860
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: Thank you.

01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:23.280
[ Applause ]

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:24.690
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: So we
have time for questions

01:06:24.690 --> 01:06:27.770
and we also have some question

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:29.820
and answers [inaudible]
panelists if you like.

01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:34.440
So we have some mics here
and are there anything else

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:41.640
that maybe you all would like
to take on board and discuss

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.940
or something [inaudible].

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:44.710
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson: One quick
thing that we don't really focus

01:06:44.710 --> 01:06:46.800
on I think Gordon alluded to.

01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:50.270
There were members of Congress
who were responsive to the folks

01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:53.730
at the Poor People's
Campaign, like John Conyers

01:06:53.730 --> 01:06:56.640
and Adam Clayton Powell,
who was, at that time,

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:59.360
the chair of the House,
Education and Labor Committee.

01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:01.360
And had it not been for
Adam Clayton Powell,

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:03.760
Johnson would not have
gotten through most

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.730
of the Great Society
programming.

01:07:05.730 --> 01:07:08.310
And I mention it because
one of the legacies

01:07:08.310 --> 01:07:13.310
at the Poor People's Campaign
left was those legislative

01:07:13.310 --> 01:07:16.430
concepts that we should
pick up and run with today,

01:07:16.430 --> 01:07:19.380
like the full Employment
Opportunity Act,

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:20.980
the Randolph budget.

01:07:20.980 --> 01:07:23.810
There were about five
or six of them that --

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:28.770
so and this was three
years prior to the founding

01:07:28.770 --> 01:07:31.230
of the Congressional
Black Caucus.

01:07:31.230 --> 01:07:32.530
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: Yeah.

01:07:32.530 --> 01:07:33.830
That's right.

01:07:33.830 --> 01:07:38.170
The Solidarity Day march and
rally, which was on June 19th,

01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:41.950
in '68, attracted, oh,

01:07:41.950 --> 01:07:44.340
conservative estimates
were 50,000.

01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:47.370
Probably, may have been
well over 75,000 or 100,000

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:49.500
but there were several
presidential candidates

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.650
that showed up, including Hubert
Humphrey and gene McCarthy,

01:07:53.650 --> 01:07:57.750
mostly from the Democratic
side of things.

01:07:57.750 --> 01:07:59.170
But you're right.

01:07:59.170 --> 01:08:02.070
I mean, there were certainly
members of Congress that were --

01:08:02.070 --> 01:08:05.890
that visited Resurrection
City, were very sympathetic,

01:08:05.890 --> 01:08:08.450
and introduced legislation
in Congress,

01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.290
of course, as one of them.

01:08:10.290 --> 01:08:14.660
So yeah. There was definitely
-- people were paying attention.

01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.700
I mean, it's something else to
think about perhaps going back

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.600
to Resurrection City
briefly is that to be able

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.830
to pitch a tent city
on the mall,

01:08:23.830 --> 01:08:27.630
you have to get the
Department of Interior's okay.

01:08:27.630 --> 01:08:29.850
So they had permits
to do this, right?

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:34.640
And so you might ask, well,
why would the Department

01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:37.410
of Interior actually okay this?

01:08:37.410 --> 01:08:40.620
But the Johnson administration,
you know, I spent a lot of time

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:43.480
in the Johnson Library
in Austin.

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.860
All of his aides -- Johnson
was very much opposed to this,

01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:53.350
did not want to -- did not
want this on his doorstep,

01:08:53.350 --> 01:08:57.660
but his aides said, you know,
look back at other moments

01:08:57.660 --> 01:09:01.400
when people have marched on
Washington and pitched tents

01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:04.260
and lived in Washington
and lobbied for things,

01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:08.730
like the 1932 Bonus Army, which
were World War I vets looking

01:09:08.730 --> 01:09:10.440
for their bonuses early.

01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.480
They were -- basically, they
were burned out of their tents

01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:21.010
and sent back over the
bridges by no -- someone --

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:25.190
the army led by Douglas
MacArthur.

01:09:25.190 --> 01:09:29.590
And so they're like, "We don't
want that to happen again."

01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:31.540
So they looked back
at the history --

01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:34.410
we're actually reading
the Age of Roosevelt

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:35.710
by Arthur Schlesinger.

01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:39.160
And saying, "We don't want
the same thing to happen

01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:40.480
that happened with
the Bonus Army.

01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.450
So we're going to
let this happen,

01:09:42.450 --> 01:09:45.900
let folks have their peace,
you know, say their piece,

01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:50.020
and but we can pull the
permit eventually if we want."

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:51.320
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: And they did.

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.620
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler:
They did on June 23rd.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:53.920
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: And then
they arrested everybody.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:55.220
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: Exactly.

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.520
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: Let me just
tag onto what you're saying.

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.620
First of all, I want to
say thank you to you all.

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:00.040
What you're getting, I
think, is just incredible.

01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:02.240
I just -- it just
really blew me away.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.980
I can't wait until the
whole thing is amazing.

01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:11.710
But so part of the reason we
have the permit was Kennedy's

01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.690
office, is why we got --

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:18.710
Bobby Kennedy's office is why
the permit was granted, A. B,

01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.260
they -- I was there
the last day.

01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:23.780
They did attack.

01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:27.060
They came in with bulldozers
and police and they came

01:10:27.060 --> 01:10:31.530
in because someone had said
someone had thrown some things

01:10:31.530 --> 01:10:35.590
at a police car, other police
cars, which was complete B.S.

01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:39.740
because there was a point
where a bunch of people

01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:45.290
in the camp were actually sent
back to Chicago, put on busses,

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:49.620
they were members of gangs
who we knew had been paid

01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:53.350
by the police to [inaudible]
trouble inside the camp

01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:55.690
and create problems.

01:10:55.690 --> 01:10:59.010
They were identified
and put back on the bus.

01:10:59.010 --> 01:11:00.310
So that was real.

01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:02.750
So there was a lot of
[inaudible] from FBI

01:11:02.750 --> 01:11:05.250
and the others trying to
destroy what was going

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:07.490
on inside the camp that was
already self-destructing

01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:10.680
in its own ways, but the FBI
came in and added to that,

01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:12.120
as did the government.

01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:16.040
And then they came
in the last day --

01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:19.470
I remember having this
conversation with people,

01:11:19.470 --> 01:11:21.920
some older people who had --

01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:25.160
my age now, but they
were older then.

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.340
Really old people.

01:11:27.340 --> 01:11:31.160
They -- and who had been gone
-- who had gone through the '30s

01:11:31.160 --> 01:11:34.820
and more and talking
about the Bonus March

01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:36.350
that had happened before that.

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:37.650
And it felt like that.

01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:41.500
I mean, they came in
lobbed in tear gas,

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.220
came in with bulldozers,
began tearing things up,

01:11:45.220 --> 01:11:48.470
arresting people, and I'm --

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:52.880
it's a moment I will
never forget just

01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:57.200
because there was this young
woman with two little kids,

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:01.960
didn't know where to go, what
to do, tear gas was everywhere.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:05.100
And I remember grabbing
one of her kids

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:10.500
and putting a mud-soaked cloth
on her kids face and said,

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.800
"Put this on your
other kid's face,

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.330
put this on your face
and grab my belt.

01:12:13.330 --> 01:12:14.880
We're going to get
the hell out of here."

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:17.160
And we got out.

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.820
And we were able
not to be arrested.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.970
And but that was the scene
going on all over the camp

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:24.780
for the few people
who were left.

01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:26.080
So it was the --
they did attack.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:31.030
And so you remember, this
is on the heels of the --

01:12:31.030 --> 01:12:37.450
what people would want to call a
riot, a rebellion that happened

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:39.480
in '68, when King
was assassinated.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:42.050
I was living in the
middle of DC at that time,

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.530
and so this was a part of that.

01:12:43.530 --> 01:12:46.860
I mean, it was a -- there was a
continuum in the minds of people

01:12:46.860 --> 01:12:48.690
in the government
about what happened

01:12:48.690 --> 01:12:51.220
after King was assassinated,
what took place

01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:54.640
because of the assassination
and what this movement meant.

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.960
And remember Bobby Kennedy was
killed while we were in the camp

01:12:57.960 --> 01:13:02.860
and they brought -- and
his -- what do you call it?

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:04.590
What's the word I'm looking for?

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:06.660
When they stopped with
his Hearst and stuff.

01:13:06.660 --> 01:13:07.960
They stopped outside the --

01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:09.260
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
The motorcade.

01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.560
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: The
motorcade stopped.

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.860
Thank you.

01:13:11.860 --> 01:13:13.160
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
The funeral procession.

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.460
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: And they
-- so when they stopped,

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:15.760
that was a moment that I think
that is important for people

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.060
to remember in history just

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.540
because I had never experienced
anything like that in my life

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.060
at that moment when
that happened.

01:13:20.060 --> 01:13:23.270
And it stopped -- everybody who
was in the camp and even some

01:13:23.270 --> 01:13:25.640
of the folks who were outside of
the camp from Hawthorne School

01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:29.260
and some other places all
stopped and lined the place.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:31.680
There was dead silence

01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:37.950
and everybody began singing John
Brown's Body at that moment.

01:13:37.950 --> 01:13:40.780
And it was just this powerful
moment that took place.

01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.450
And there were people inside
the government who didn't want

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:46.300
that stuff to happen so
the permit was denied.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.730
I mean, the permit was stopped.

01:13:47.730 --> 01:13:50.080
They wouldn't let us
stay and they came in.

01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.670
There was symbolic arrests

01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:53.730
but there was also a little
terror at the end as well.

01:13:53.730 --> 01:13:55.880
I just want to throw that
out there, that this be --

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.960
wasn't all hunky dory with the
U.S. government at that moment.

01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.410
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson: The
great irony of this, of course,

01:14:00.410 --> 01:14:04.310
was that we had the Democratic
Party convention quote riots

01:14:04.310 --> 01:14:06.450
that took place later
that summer.

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:10.960
And we also had the My Lai
Massacre and the Tet Offensive

01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.360
in the same year,

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.720
which emphasized the
desperation of the Vietnam War.

01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:17.970
So all those things
were happening

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:20.500
in the same sort
of temporal space.

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.020
And I think the other piece
of this, I think Gordon

01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.570
and Marc mentioned, the
folks who went back,

01:14:27.570 --> 01:14:32.310
think of the number of
poverty program directors

01:14:32.310 --> 01:14:34.520
who ran for elected office.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.190
I was thinking of
Parren Mitchell

01:14:36.190 --> 01:14:39.580
who had run the poverty
program in Baltimore,

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.520
became our first black
congressman from Baltimore.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:45.940
So this spawned a whole lot of
activity in the electoral realm

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.740
that is still with us today.

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:51.930
By the way, they the new
mayor of San Francisco,

01:14:51.930 --> 01:14:54.270
who's an African-American
woman, London Breed.

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:57.300
She had been confirmed
as the new mayor.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.880
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: I think by
some people who's not one of --

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.180
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson:
Its by -- absolutely.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.480
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler:
I know we want

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.780
to open it up for questions.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:05.080
One quick thing.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.380
I mean, this conversation
has reminded me of is

01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.480
that if there is anything that
folks agreed upon that came

01:15:10.480 --> 01:15:15.170
to Washington, was an opposition
to state violence, right.

01:15:15.170 --> 01:15:18.430
And what that -- and state
violence could be both overseas

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:22.510
and in Southeast Asia but
also here at home, right.

01:15:22.510 --> 01:15:26.930
And so that was the moment when,
you know, folks from across --

01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:30.590
in sort of a pretty wide
ideological spectrum even among

01:15:30.590 --> 01:15:34.280
those who came who were
part of the campaign.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.930
This was the number one
issue that everyone agreed

01:15:36.930 --> 01:15:38.660
on that needed to stop, right.

01:15:38.660 --> 01:15:42.180
We needed to end the war and we
need to end police suppression

01:15:42.180 --> 01:15:43.780
in poor communities, right.

01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.400
Whether it was white,
brown, or black.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.910
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson: And we had
the current commission report

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:49.730
also that had come
out the previous year.

01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:51.030
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: Yeah.

01:15:51.030 --> 01:15:54.200
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: And just a thought
on the, you know, this narrative

01:15:54.200 --> 01:15:56.180
of success versus failure

01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.680
of the original campaign
is really interesting.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.610
It's something that, you know,
the day you're describing, Marc,

01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:03.520
is like, you know, you look back

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.580
at what the newspapers
were saying at that time

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.110
and it says, this is the end.

01:16:07.110 --> 01:16:09.670
The Resurrection City
falls, the campaign fails.

01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:11.460
But that's not really
-- when you --

01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.120
it's not really what
happened, right.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:16.010
And I think the Poor People's
Campaign today and maybe some

01:16:16.010 --> 01:16:18.760
of the people here who are
from the campaign might speak

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:21.670
to this a little bit, you
know, is evidence of the fact

01:16:21.670 --> 01:16:25.770
that that work continued
and really changed the way

01:16:25.770 --> 01:16:27.880
that a lot of people would
approach that kind of organizing

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.200
for the rest of their lives.

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.500
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner:
You can't -- see.

01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:32.650
I think that one of the things
that people make a mistake,

01:16:32.650 --> 01:16:35.680
talk about winning and
losing, It -- I mean, to me --

01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:37.320
and I don't want to get
too philosophic about this,

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:41.770
but to me, just existence
and living in a society is,

01:16:41.770 --> 01:16:43.580
the struggle as part of it.

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:46.760
And so you know, in existence
is struggle no matter of what

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.440
that made -- wherever you are.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.590
And so, you know,
people say that like,

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:52.560
let's say that reconstruction
people say reconstruction was

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.860
a failure.

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.160
Reconstruction wasn't a failure.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.990
It was one of beautiful
moments in American history.

01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:58.290
They killed reconstruction

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:01.210
because they didn't want
it to happen in 1877.

01:17:01.210 --> 01:17:03.070
They made sure it didn't happen.

01:17:03.070 --> 01:17:05.770
And so the same thing
with what happened in '68

01:17:05.770 --> 01:17:07.590
but we build on those things.

01:17:07.590 --> 01:17:08.890
That's not the end.

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:10.190
It keeps moving.

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:11.680
Who knows what it
means ultimately

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.130
but it just means
that, you know,

01:17:13.130 --> 01:17:16.020
as long as we have a nation
where there's poverty,

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.230
a nation where the racism is
at the root of our country.

01:17:18.230 --> 01:17:21.380
That kind of exploitation
is the root of things

01:17:21.380 --> 01:17:22.680
for many people this country.

01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:24.570
That struggle's going
to continue.

01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:29.160
So it's, you know, it's
-- I'm 72 years old so --

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:35.120
and people your age, your
generation are carrying it on.

01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.530
It's not done.

01:17:36.530 --> 01:17:38.210
We just keep walking on
the shoulders of the folks

01:17:38.210 --> 01:17:39.750
who came before us
and keep pushing.

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:43.660
And when we push, we get
pushed back and you got

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.400
to keep pushing forward,
you know.

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:46.700
So it never stops.

01:17:46.700 --> 01:17:48.040
You can't let it stop.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:51.450
So I don't get into
failures and successes.

01:17:51.450 --> 01:17:54.220
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: And on
that note, I love the example

01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.660
of the song, Everybody's
Got a Right to Live

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:59.290
because it's a song
that Jimmy Claire

01:17:59.290 --> 01:18:03.910
and Reverend Frederick Douglas
Kirkpatrick wrote back in 1968.

01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:06.180
And they put together --
they have a whole album.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:11.060
You can talk to me at how
you can listen to it online.

01:18:11.060 --> 01:18:12.360
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: Cool.

01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:13.660
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore:
But today they're --

01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.720
the new Poor People's Campaign
is using Everybody's Got a Right

01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:19.470
to Live but they've
added a little element

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:21.480
of hip-hop in that song.

01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:24.610
And teaching people how to
sing it and so it's just,

01:18:24.610 --> 01:18:28.050
I love this example of
the old and the new today.

01:18:28.050 --> 01:18:30.350
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: Yeah.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:40.260
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: I would
like to hear a little bit more

01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:42.350
about lessons learned
that are relevant

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:44.730
for what's going on right.

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:49.670
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson: Well,

01:18:49.670 --> 01:18:52.380
I think one obvious lesson
is persistence, tenacity,

01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:55.790
true press the earth's
going to rise again.

01:18:55.790 --> 01:18:57.370
So it's not over.

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:59.190
We have to write
the next chapters.

01:18:59.190 --> 01:19:00.690
I think that's what
we've learned.

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:02.260
We've learned -- I'm
coming back with something

01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.560
that Gordon mentioned.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.200
Policy is one piece of it

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:09.010
but it's really the
grassroots community organizing

01:19:09.010 --> 01:19:10.750
that makes the change.

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:13.980
And once the changes are
made you have to keep adding

01:19:13.980 --> 01:19:16.990
because there's always a chance
people dismantle those changes

01:19:16.990 --> 01:19:18.940
as we're seeing in
the court decisions.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.240
So we're learning these lessons.

01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.060
And we're also learning that if
you don't socialize your young

01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:28.080
people at the very early age
to get involved in these kinds

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.060
of activities, they will
be indifferent and inactive

01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.620
when they become adults.

01:19:32.620 --> 01:19:35.080
And those are some things that
just sort of stood out for me

01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.240
about this experience.

01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:41.530
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: And to
add onto that I would say

01:19:41.530 --> 01:19:43.470
that a similar system
[inaudible]

01:19:43.470 --> 01:19:46.080
to my 22-year-old self.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:52.500
But you know, I would just
say it played right out here.

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.530
Capitalism it, to
me is the problem.

01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:56.320
But we're not going overthrow it

01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.220
like we thought we were
going to do when I was 22.

01:19:59.220 --> 01:20:02.090
But we need to organize
and fight

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:06.410
to contain it before it destroys
us and the rest of the planet.

01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:11.370
And I think that for me, one
of the things that's missing

01:20:11.370 --> 01:20:13.390
at this moment and maybe it's
because I'm not aware of it

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:15.330
and maybe things are happening
that I'm not aware of,

01:20:15.330 --> 01:20:20.290
which is very, very true,
but it's organizing.

01:20:20.290 --> 01:20:24.040
By that I mean the hard
work of organizing.

01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:27.380
One of the things that came
out of our conversations

01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.230
in doing the tapes for the
African-American Museum

01:20:29.230 --> 01:20:32.420
on the Poor People's Campaign
interviewing a lot of folks

01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:35.250
who I know and didn't know
from back in the 60's.

01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.670
Was [inaudible] to organize.

01:20:37.670 --> 01:20:40.080
You know, when you have
people in Mississippi

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:42.330
like Fannie Lou Hamer.

01:20:42.330 --> 01:20:43.630
For those who don't know,

01:20:43.630 --> 01:20:46.170
Fannie Lou was an
incredible human being.

01:20:46.170 --> 01:20:48.730
She was a sharecropper who
became a leader of the --

01:20:48.730 --> 01:20:50.550
the movement of Mississippi

01:20:50.550 --> 01:20:52.520
out of the student
[inaudible] committee.

01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:55.580
And was -- and so she organized
the Mississippi Freedom

01:20:55.580 --> 01:21:00.170
Democratic Party, which demanded
a seat in the 1964 convention.

01:21:00.170 --> 01:21:03.610
I was there at that point
in Atlantic City with MFDP.

01:21:03.610 --> 01:21:05.770
And she was this
force of nature.

01:21:05.770 --> 01:21:08.380
But it wasn't her, it
was the fact that she

01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.510
and the people she worked with
were organizing cooperatives,

01:21:11.510 --> 01:21:13.710
organizing resistance
in Mississippi,

01:21:13.710 --> 01:21:15.540
and organizing things that learn

01:21:15.540 --> 01:21:18.240
to the Mississippi
Freedom Democratic Party,

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.430
and led to black political
power in Mississippi.

01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:25.930
And they had a co-opsy
organized.

01:21:25.930 --> 01:21:28.420
In the 60's and early
70's in Baltimore,

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.990
we were organizing co-ops
in people's neighborhoods.

01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:36.360
Food co-ops, tenants unions,
striking against landlords,

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:38.960
people actually actively
building things.

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:41.450
That's what it takes to
build a movement that ties

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:43.330
into electoral politics as well.

01:21:43.330 --> 01:21:44.630
You know, they're not separate.

01:21:44.630 --> 01:21:46.040
You have a base to work from.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:49.330
And I think that --
and you're seeing --

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:51.330
there's an energy
out of here now

01:21:51.330 --> 01:21:53.320
as I've not seen
before in a long time.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:55.920
The Poor People's
Campaign is taking place.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.950
All the young progressive
politicians

01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:00.420
of America being
elected across America.

01:22:00.420 --> 01:22:01.720
They're coming from a base

01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:03.270
of work they're doing
in communities.

01:22:03.270 --> 01:22:04.570
So there is something.

01:22:04.570 --> 01:22:07.360
We're just not -- we have to
be aware that it's happening.

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:08.660
But I think that, you
know -- so it's --

01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:10.280
we have lessons from
[inaudible] --

01:22:10.280 --> 01:22:14.290
people say learn
from our mistakes.

01:22:14.290 --> 01:22:16.250
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.740
Young people are going
to make mistakes.

01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:19.040
Now we made mistakes.

01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.340
What does that mean?

01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:21.640
It just means you
keep on rolling,

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:23.120
you just don't stop, you know.

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:25.830
So I mean, so I don't like
to dwell on mistakes so much,

01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:29.290
as learning from what you
do and just keep on pushing.

01:22:29.290 --> 01:22:30.590
As the song says.

01:22:30.590 --> 01:22:32.260
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: And
how about leadership.

01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:33.850
I mean, that's a lesson I think

01:22:33.850 --> 01:22:36.540
that the new campaign really
emphasizes this is, you know,

01:22:36.540 --> 01:22:37.840
we have to develop leaders.

01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:39.340
What happens when
the leader falls?

01:22:39.340 --> 01:22:41.300
Who picks up the torch?

01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:44.590
So it's, you know, leadership
development has to be

01:22:44.590 --> 01:22:48.360
at the forefront of
that kind of organizing.

01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:50.370
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: And
when leaders come

01:22:50.370 --> 01:22:51.930
up they will -- they.

01:22:51.930 --> 01:22:53.230
Who's they?

01:22:53.230 --> 01:22:54.530
They can be whatever they --

01:22:54.530 --> 01:22:56.720
that means particular
historical moment.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:23:00.280
But the most effective
people often were taken

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:02.430
out in the '60s.

01:23:02.430 --> 01:23:06.960
I mean, I don't just mean
-- I mean killed, murdered.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:08.260
Fred Hampton.

01:23:08.260 --> 01:23:11.540
I mean, when we talk about
the young patriots in Chicago,

01:23:11.540 --> 01:23:15.250
at that moment when Fred Hampton
was assassinated by the police

01:23:15.250 --> 01:23:18.410
in Chicago, what was being
organized was the young

01:23:18.410 --> 01:23:19.710
patriots, the young lords,

01:23:19.710 --> 01:23:22.110
the brown berets,
the black panthers.

01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:24.290
Organizations -- he
was organizing --

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:27.980
it wasn't really his idea but
he latched onto another panther

01:23:27.980 --> 01:23:29.810
that came up with
the idea actually.

01:23:29.810 --> 01:23:33.830
But anyway, they were building
was multiracial coalition

01:23:33.830 --> 01:23:37.000
in Chicago and they
couldn't have that.

01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.360
So Fred Hampton was
assassinated.

01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.710
And those things happen.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:43.740
And those were real
and we have to realize

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:48.800
that those things were real and
not shy away from our history.

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.300
And whenever you have a social
movement, once it begins

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:58.650
to threaten structures
and threaten real change.

01:23:58.650 --> 01:23:59.950
&gt;&gt; Lenneal Henderson: Backlash.

01:23:59.950 --> 01:24:02.440
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: There's going
to be a push back, you know.

01:24:02.440 --> 01:24:05.540
So there was a quiescence
in some senses,

01:24:05.540 --> 01:24:06.990
I think, in our country.

01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:09.300
I mean, people got
elected to Congress,

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:12.310
[inaudible] black caucus was
founded, you know, and --

01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:15.020
but now we're in a new
stage I think you're going

01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:16.870
to see more young
people being elected,

01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:18.470
more young people
organizing and doing stuff.

01:24:18.470 --> 01:24:20.620
And I just think that's --

01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.960
I think we're in an
interesting place, you know.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.450
I'm not that pessimistic.

01:24:26.450 --> 01:24:28.810
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: And I think
I've learned that the amount

01:24:28.810 --> 01:24:32.210
of courage that it took to
actually reach across the lines

01:24:32.210 --> 01:24:35.310
of identity to bring
people together

01:24:35.310 --> 01:24:40.080
from such varied backgrounds
and create such a strong force.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.270
I think we have to be careful
today not to be isolating

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:44.760
in some of our movements.

01:24:44.760 --> 01:24:47.410
I think, you know,
as a woman I will say

01:24:47.410 --> 01:24:49.440
that the Woman's March
is incredibly powerful

01:24:49.440 --> 01:24:51.640
but it is also isolating
to some.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:55.830
So the Poor People's Campaign
is such a good example

01:24:55.830 --> 01:25:05.510
of piecing all of our work
together into one stronger idea.

01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:07.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: A new and
unsettling force, right?

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.470
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: And
Gordon's idea of coalition.

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:14.620
And one part of that was
reaching across class lines.

01:25:14.620 --> 01:25:17.220
Because there are a lot of,
quote, middle class people

01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:19.630
who were supporting the
Poor People's Campaign.

01:25:19.630 --> 01:25:21.310
And some of them were
black and some of them --

01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:23.700
many of them were white
as those 54 families

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:25.320
who accommodated folks

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.530
who weren't living
in Resurrection City.

01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:28.920
Who nobody mentions.

01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:31.780
I think we're going to
find some research on them.

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.890
And today the oppression

01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:37.780
of the middle class
threatens that resource.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:41.050
Just as Marc was saying, people
are beginning to organize

01:25:41.050 --> 01:25:42.400
from the grassroots up.

01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:44.670
We're now assassinating
the middle class,

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:47.580
which has been a historical
resource for a lot of change.

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:51.150
So that's a lesson that we've
got to pick up and run with.

01:25:51.150 --> 01:25:52.770
&gt;&gt; Nick Petr: Yeah I think we
have to remember certain things.

01:25:52.770 --> 01:25:54.280
The things that were in my head
the other day watching these

01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:58.890
children being separated
from their families,

01:25:58.890 --> 01:26:03.580
all I could think about was a
take on the poem from the '30s

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:07.280
in Germany, first they
came for the immigrants.

01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:08.710
What did you do?

01:26:08.710 --> 01:26:10.290
What we do?

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:13.940
And so we -- and we talk
about identity politics.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:21.160
Sometimes that word is used in a
negative vain but the reality is

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.670
that movements come out of
people, whatever they are,

01:26:26.670 --> 01:26:33.750
who are oppressed as their own
natural movements of survival.

01:26:33.750 --> 01:26:35.540
That's where they come from.

01:26:35.540 --> 01:26:38.910
And they're not to be
condemned, I think.

01:26:38.910 --> 01:26:41.690
This is just -- it's a
reality it's just is reality

01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:43.980
and you've got to
address that reality

01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:45.280
but that doesn't mean
bridges can't built.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.600
It doesn't mean coalitions
can't be built.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:48.190
It doesn't mean people
can't work together

01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:50.280
to make something happen.

01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:52.510
You know, I think that's
something we have to remember.

01:26:52.510 --> 01:26:55.750
I mean, every movement in
the world started that way.

01:26:55.750 --> 01:26:59.130
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler: I definitely
think one of the lessons

01:26:59.130 --> 01:27:00.920
from the campaign and
one of the things I

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.770
like about the new Poor
People's Campaign as well is

01:27:03.770 --> 01:27:05.550
that it's not just
about Washington.

01:27:05.550 --> 01:27:08.010
It's not just about coming

01:27:08.010 --> 01:27:10.640
to D.C. That's important
symbolically.

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:13.150
It's important for, you know,
for bringing people together

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:17.420
from around the country
for purposes of the media.

01:27:17.420 --> 01:27:21.840
But going to state capitals and
organizing in more local places.

01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:26.180
I mean, I live in Virginia and,
you know, we've seen -- we --

01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:28.310
you know, more progressive
people.

01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:31.120
I'm trying not to get partisan
here but more progressive people

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.260
on this took over the
House of Delegates.

01:27:34.260 --> 01:27:36.640
There's been Medicaid
expansion in that state

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.840
as a result of that, right.

01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:42.850
And so it's not just about what
the federal government is doing,

01:27:42.850 --> 01:27:45.770
right, and I think
increasing increasingly so.

01:27:45.770 --> 01:27:47.200
But what are state
government's doing?

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:50.420
What our county councils
and the school boards doing

01:27:50.420 --> 01:27:52.490
and courthouses and so.

01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:55.460
So it goes back to this idea
of local organizing, right,.

01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:59.050
So you can come to D.C. You can
be engaged with federal politics

01:27:59.050 --> 01:28:01.240
but you have to also be engaged

01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.780
with local politics
as much as possible.

01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:05.990
Electoral and otherwise, right.

01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:08.370
And so I think that
that's one of the things

01:28:08.370 --> 01:28:11.060
that the '68 campaign
didn't do as much.

01:28:11.060 --> 01:28:14.800
It was part of the long
term plan but that got --

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:16.550
that was something
that King talked about.

01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:18.030
Well we'll go to
Washington and then we'll go

01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:20.690
to the 50 biggest
cities in the country

01:28:20.690 --> 01:28:22.260
and continue to organize.

01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.790
Well they went to the
conventions, the Democratic

01:28:24.790 --> 01:28:27.810
and Republican conventions
in Chicago and Miami Beach.

01:28:27.810 --> 01:28:29.910
But that was really --
and there was a few places

01:28:29.910 --> 01:28:33.870
where you see organizing
around the campaign per se,

01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:36.620
many people went back and
did their own organizing,

01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:38.310
not necessarily under
the umbrella

01:28:38.310 --> 01:28:39.610
of the Poor People's Campaign.

01:28:39.610 --> 01:28:44.760
So in a sense it did happen
but not just through SCLC

01:28:44.760 --> 01:28:50.160
but I think that that's an
important point that it's --

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.460
you don't have to come here.

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.220
You don't have to be in
D.C. to bring change.

01:28:53.220 --> 01:28:56.830
In some ways the change really
happens in Lansing and Jackson

01:28:56.830 --> 01:29:01.100
and Albuquerque and so
that's -- and Richmond.

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.700
Those are the places
that are just

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:04.000
as important if not more so.

01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.300
So.

01:29:11.310 --> 01:29:13.760
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: I
wanted to ask you, Maggie,

01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:17.390
how the materials digitized

01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:24.440
by the D.C. Public Library are
available to the broad public.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:25.740
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore: Sure.

01:29:25.740 --> 01:29:29.600
Digdc.dclibrary.org and you
don't need a library card

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:31.900
to log in.

01:29:34.230 --> 01:29:35.530
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner:
That's important.

01:29:35.530 --> 01:29:36.870
&gt;&gt; Maggie Gilmore:
And there is --

01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:40.460
you'll see there is a Poor
People's Campaign collection

01:29:40.460 --> 01:29:43.590
where, you know,
again or another point

01:29:43.590 --> 01:29:44.890
to what we have learned.

01:29:44.890 --> 01:29:47.060
You can actually look
at some of the documents

01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:51.710
and see the language that
was used in lobbying Congress

01:29:51.710 --> 01:29:56.460
and the different locations that
they were going to and targeting

01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:59.950
and some of the requests
and the demands

01:29:59.950 --> 01:30:03.630
that were being made
at that time.

01:30:03.630 --> 01:30:05.710
&gt;&gt; Anna Yaga: Does this work?

01:30:05.710 --> 01:30:08.850
Oh here we go.

01:30:08.850 --> 01:30:10.740
My name is Anna Yaga [assumed
spelling] I'm an artist

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.430
in residence with the
D.C. Public Library

01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:15.440
so I'm working closely
with Maggie and Nick.

01:30:15.440 --> 01:30:17.860
And also with the Poor
People's Campaign.

01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:23.170
And you know, one of the things
that strikes me now, I mean,

01:30:23.170 --> 01:30:24.610
you speak about this
attempt, you know,

01:30:24.610 --> 01:30:27.770
this attempted assassination
of the middle class.

01:30:27.770 --> 01:30:31.790
And I just want to share
something that's been tumbling

01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:36.620
and like this foundation or
these identities of around class

01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:39.760
that have really been
smashed and disrupted.

01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:43.890
And you know, for me --
and I ended up speaking.

01:30:43.890 --> 01:30:47.140
I ended up testifying last
couple weeks ago on the right

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.680
to health care and
a healthy planet.

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:52.180
And you know, I just want
to put out there that I came

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:55.670
to this movement work
thinking of myself as an ally.

01:30:55.670 --> 01:30:59.670
And I feel like this idea of
the middle class is such a lie

01:30:59.670 --> 01:31:02.490
and an illusion because,
you know,

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:03.830
you're just a few
more paychecks away

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:05.340
from being out on the street.

01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:08.780
And you know, when I was
organizing in public housing,

01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:11.140
Miss Mary, who was
like the local profit,

01:31:11.140 --> 01:31:13.810
she would say that same thing.

01:31:13.810 --> 01:31:16.510
That if you make
$60,000, you know.

01:31:16.510 --> 01:31:19.480
And I understand that -- I
understood it intellectually,

01:31:19.480 --> 01:31:24.150
right, but it wasn't until I had
lost my housing, my health care,

01:31:24.150 --> 01:31:27.010
my income all in
one month, right.

01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:31.100
And that the kind of pinnacle
of a number of experiences

01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.870
like even before that.

01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:36.310
Finding a letter on the house
that I lived in that said

01:31:36.310 --> 01:31:38.690
that the police are
coming to get your things,

01:31:38.690 --> 01:31:42.140
you have 30 days to get out
it was an illegal eviction.

01:31:42.140 --> 01:31:43.550
It didn't make, you
know -- and that was --

01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:46.040
the landlord basically
had been going

01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:48.280
through foreclosure
and didn't tell us.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:51.670
And so all of these different
experiences culminating

01:31:51.670 --> 01:31:54.980
in me coming to the very people
that I was, had been organizing

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.110
within public housing
saying what do I do

01:31:57.110 --> 01:31:59.000
because it had happened
to them first.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:02.290
And so I feel like in this
attempted assassination

01:32:02.290 --> 01:32:06.450
where it's also an opportunity,
it's an invitation for people

01:32:06.450 --> 01:32:09.250
to really like, let
the lies shed

01:32:09.250 --> 01:32:11.880
so that we can actually
come together.

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:17.270
And I just want to share that
as a way to kind of offer,

01:32:17.270 --> 01:32:21.880
you know, it's one thing
to speak about something

01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:25.430
as disconnected or like
someone else, it's another

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:29.260
to recognize how like we
are part of this tapestry

01:32:29.260 --> 01:32:30.560
and connected together.

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.760
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: As we used
to say in the 60's, right on.

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.860
I can dig it.

01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:40.160
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
So -- here?

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.460
Is this on?

01:32:42.460 --> 01:32:45.620
I would like to suggest
that, you know, popping back

01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:47.870
to the question of leadership

01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:52.820
and lessons learned
from 50 years ago.

01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:56.570
That I think we have
begun to understand

01:32:56.570 --> 01:33:02.040
that organizations need to
be people led and rather

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:05.010
than led by specific leaders.

01:33:05.010 --> 01:33:09.600
And I think that that
is a major, a major,

01:33:09.600 --> 01:33:12.020
major a contribution
from that era.

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.320
&gt;&gt; Marc Steiner: Yeah.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.620
That's right.

01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:18.020
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: That actually
leads me to the observation.

01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.400
I was working in Jamaica.

01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:23.410
One of the great sort of
legends about Michael Manley,

01:33:23.410 --> 01:33:26.890
who was the, trying to run
for office in the 1960s was,

01:33:26.890 --> 01:33:29.840
he was trying to gain the
support of Rastafarians

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.590
and he went to a delegation
of elders and he said --

01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:34.540
and he was trying to
figure out who to talk to

01:33:34.540 --> 01:33:37.660
and he said kept asking,
"Well who's your leader

01:33:37.660 --> 01:33:38.960
of your organization?"

01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:42.340
And an old elder man sort of
pipes up finally and says,

01:33:42.340 --> 01:33:43.810
"Rasta is not an organization.

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:45.270
It's an organism."

01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:50.420
So it was a kind of a, you know,
a kind of a movement from below

01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:52.860
which is part of the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating

01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:55.470
Committee and all of that
I think it's also resonant

01:33:55.470 --> 01:33:57.920
in this particular setting.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.620
And I'm going to
have the last word

01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:01.980
because we are approaching
the time.

01:34:01.980 --> 01:34:06.400
And Gordon Mantler has very
kindly consented to sign copies

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:08.270
of his book, Power to the Poor.

01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:09.570
They're right out there.

01:34:09.570 --> 01:34:10.870
We're going to give
you about 10 minutes

01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:12.170
to take care of business.

01:34:12.170 --> 01:34:14.290
Go buy several copies
of Gordon's book.

01:34:14.290 --> 01:34:17.030
There's wife -- there's
wives and --

01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:19.250
wife and children to support.

01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:20.550
Not wives, sorry.

01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:21.930
&gt;&gt; Gordon Mantler:
Yeah, not wives.

01:34:21.930 --> 01:34:25.150
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: And
it's a brilliant book

01:34:25.150 --> 01:34:28.860
and I think it sets the
foundation for all the kind

01:34:28.860 --> 01:34:30.160
of work that we're doing today.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.570
Which is one of the reasons
we're honored to have Gordon,

Nick Petr, more to come.

01:34:37.270 --> 01:34:39.630
These questions about
what we're going to do

01:34:39.630 --> 01:34:41.420
and how the lessons learned
in the past will be taken

01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:44.780
up in the next panel by
another able set of folks.

01:34:44.780 --> 01:34:47.510
So thank you and a hand
for our guests please.

01:34:47.510 --> 01:34:56.510

[ Background Conversation ]

01:40:08.510 --> 01:55:14.280
[ Background Conversation ]

01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.080
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: All right.

01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:38.570
[ Background Conversation ]

01:55:38.570 --> 01:55:39.870
All right.

01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:41.170
Thank you all.

01:55:41.170 --> 01:55:42.470
Welcome back.

01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:46.160
And we're going to get
started with session two here

01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:49.150
of the symposium
before and after '68,

01:55:49.150 --> 01:55:52.160
the Poor People's
Campaign, not then and now.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:55.000
It was a brilliant
session this morning.

01:55:55.000 --> 01:55:58.810
It would be a promises uniquely
brilliant one this afternoon.

01:55:58.810 --> 01:56:01.840
I'm going to, again,
as John did earlier,

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:05.270
to briefly introduce
our distinguished panel

01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:08.030
and then go on from there.

01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:12.350
So starting immediately
to my left.

01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:15.690
You have Dr. Reginald Jackson
who is visual artist and scholar

01:56:15.690 --> 01:56:18.770
and the founder and president
of [inaudible] Communications

01:56:18.770 --> 01:56:20.280
in Boston, Massachusetts.

01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:24.490
It's a nonprofit organization
he formed in 1988 to document

01:56:24.490 --> 01:56:26.360
and form and provide
consultative research

01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.050
about the visual and
cultural dimensions

01:56:28.050 --> 01:56:31.100
of the global African diaspora.

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:33.630
He's a professor
[inaudible] of communications

01:56:33.630 --> 01:56:37.410
of Simmons College in Boston and
a whole host of other degrees

01:56:37.410 --> 01:56:39.180
which you can read
about on the website.

01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:41.780
We'd be here all
afternoon just trying

01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:43.610
to get through that twice.

01:56:43.610 --> 01:56:48.150
Similarly next to him,
Dr. Bruce Jackson is also

01:56:48.150 --> 01:56:49.490
equally distinguished.

01:56:49.490 --> 01:56:52.760
Another brilliant scholar
from American Folklore.

01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:55.320
Documentary filmmaker,
writer, photographer.

01:56:55.320 --> 01:56:57.650
And distinguished professor
James Agee professor

01:56:57.650 --> 01:56:59.930
of American Culture at
the University of Buffalo.

01:56:59.930 --> 01:57:02.030
He's the author of
over 40 books.

01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:04.740
A point of pride for us the
American Folklife Center is

01:57:04.740 --> 01:57:07.530
that he was chair of our
board of trustees way back

01:57:07.530 --> 01:57:12.530
in the 1980's, if I can
say way back in 1980's.

01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:15.060
Dr. Jackson continues
to do amazing work.

01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:19.950
Continues to work his recordings

01:57:19.950 --> 01:57:22.670
of Commons [inaudible] has
now been adapted into a play,

01:57:22.670 --> 01:57:24.580
a touring play by
the Wooster Group.

01:57:24.580 --> 01:57:28.530
And you can catch that
on of, off, off Broadway,

01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:30.380
I think, if I'm not mistaken.

01:57:30.380 --> 01:57:33.150
Next to that is another
terrific colleague

01:57:33.150 --> 01:57:36.090
and a person who's been
at the fulcrum of a lot

01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:39.420
of activities here in Washington
D.C. to commemorate events

01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:42.590
of 1968 in Washington.

01:57:42.590 --> 01:57:46.150
Marya McQuirter is a
curator of D.C. 1968,

01:57:46.150 --> 01:57:48.890
a project commemorating the
50th anniversary of 1968

01:57:48.890 --> 01:57:50.210
and D.C., I just said.

01:57:50.210 --> 01:57:53.740
And every day throughout 2018
she will tell us how she's been

01:57:53.740 --> 01:57:56.210
producing and share original
stories and photographs

01:57:56.210 --> 01:57:59.490
on her website
DC.1968project.com

01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:03.040
which will be the topic
of her presentation today.

01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:07.170
And on to her left is Charon
Hribar, who's a director

01:58:07.170 --> 01:58:09.440
of cultural strategies
at the Carroll Center

01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:12.480
for religion rights
and social justice.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:15.300
She also serves as a
co-director of theomusicology

01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.880
and movement arts for the
new Poor People's Campaign.

01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:22.500
And she along with her partner
Yara Allen have joined us

01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.910
from an exhausting
schedule of actions

01:58:24.910 --> 01:58:27.590
across the southeast
and nationally.

01:58:27.590 --> 01:58:30.920
Yara Allen, a native
of Rocky Mountain,

01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:34.240
North Carolina is
director of cultural arts

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:37.290

01:58:39.920 --> 01:58:41.540
for moral revival.

01:58:41.540 --> 01:58:42.840
Yara Joina --

01:58:42.840 --> 01:58:45.970
is a singer-songwriter poet
musician whose love for music,

01:58:45.970 --> 01:58:48.510
especially jazz, gospel,
and blues, helps to create

01:58:48.510 --> 01:58:50.540
and deliver soulful
movement songs,

01:58:50.540 --> 01:58:52.530
some of which you heard
this morning that.

01:58:52.530 --> 01:58:55.680
That continues a kind of efforts
that previous generations

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:59.610
of singers have produced
in aid in the assistance

01:58:59.610 --> 01:59:01.340
of social justice campaigns.

01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:04.870
And with having said all of
that, at the very last person

01:59:04.870 --> 01:59:06.170
who will come up
here at the very end

01:59:06.170 --> 01:59:08.980
of this presentation
is the Reverend --

01:59:08.980 --> 01:59:11.910
Dr. Reverend Liz Theoharis,
who is a co-director

01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:14.750
of the Carroll Center and
the founder and coordinator

01:59:14.750 --> 01:59:16.050
of the poverty initiative,

01:59:16.050 --> 01:59:18.870
which has been spearheading
the Poor People's Campaign.

01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:22.260
And you'll hear from her at the
very end after the panel goes

01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:25.590
through and we have
another fulling discussion

01:59:25.590 --> 01:59:26.890
as we did this morning.

01:59:26.890 --> 01:59:30.430
So I'm going to start a little
bit, interestingly enough,

01:59:30.430 --> 01:59:35.000
with Dr. Bruce Jackson who will
tell us about what happened

01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:39.760
in 1968 and afterwards.

01:59:39.760 --> 01:59:42.110
Thank you, Bruce.

01:59:42.110 --> 01:59:43.660
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson: And
afterwards [inaudible].

01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:47.170
First I want to say to the panel
this morning, the first part

01:59:47.170 --> 01:59:49.170
of this session,
thank you very much.

01:59:49.170 --> 01:59:53.920
I feel much more optimistic
about the world than I was.

01:59:53.920 --> 01:59:59.550
You've given me the feeling
that Trump is an opportunity

01:59:59.550 --> 02:00:01.370
and not a -- so thank you.

02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:05.840
And the others, I hadn't
realized how much had come

02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:08.400
out of Resurrection City one.

02:00:08.400 --> 02:00:11.450
How many people had gone
on to so many things

02:00:11.450 --> 02:00:13.190
and I'm very heartened by that

02:00:13.190 --> 02:00:18.420
and I hope similar thing has
happen with this one as well.

02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:22.090
I want to begin with
just a word of context

02:00:22.090 --> 02:00:24.810
because Resurrection
City didn't just happen

02:00:24.810 --> 02:00:28.380
on it's own it didn't
just happen

02:00:28.380 --> 02:00:31.220
because Bobby Kennedy
made a suggestion.

02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:33.870
The older people in
the room know this,

02:00:33.870 --> 02:00:35.170
what I'm about to say.

02:00:35.170 --> 02:00:41.280
In 1960 there were sit
in at lunch counters.

02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:47.820
In 1961 white and black people
rode buses into the south.

02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.120
The buses who burned.

02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.590
They were beaten in jailed.

02:00:50.590 --> 02:00:56.250
In 1963 a church in
Birmingham was blown up.

02:00:56.250 --> 02:00:58.980
I Have a Dream speech happened.

02:00:58.980 --> 02:01:05.280
1965 was Selma.

02:01:05.280 --> 02:01:06.580
There was violence.

02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:07.880
There was risk.

02:01:07.880 --> 02:01:10.280
There was danger and it
was work over many years.

02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.990
The people who put
together Resurrection City,

02:01:12.990 --> 02:01:14.850
they had been through much that.

02:01:14.850 --> 02:01:18.470
They had seen their
friends, as you said, killed.

02:01:18.470 --> 02:01:22.810
Many of them had been beaten.

02:01:22.810 --> 02:01:25.110
We had [inaudible] --

02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.320
We all had these little badges

02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:35.550
and on the badges it
had our blood type.

02:01:35.550 --> 02:01:37.550
Now I've been involved
in a lot of things

02:01:37.550 --> 02:01:39.360
but I've never been
involved in a thing

02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:41.340
where they put your
blood type on it.

02:01:41.340 --> 02:01:43.330
The reason they put your
blood type on it was

02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:46.260
because the people who organized
it had been in things were a lot

02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:50.270
of them had been carted off
to the hospital [inaudible].

02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:51.770
And -- is that me?

02:01:51.770 --> 02:01:53.070
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I think so.

02:01:53.070 --> 02:01:55.650
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson:
And at the beginning

02:01:55.650 --> 02:01:59.230
of Resurrection City
there's a lot of optimism

02:01:59.230 --> 02:02:01.810
but nobody knew what
was going happen.

02:02:01.810 --> 02:02:04.600
There was a permit but
nobody knew how long

02:02:04.600 --> 02:02:06.260
that was going to stand.

02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:09.240
There had been many other things
for which there been permits

02:02:09.240 --> 02:02:12.490
and things had been
disrupted violently.

02:02:12.490 --> 02:02:16.650
So there was optimism, joy, and
a great feeling of cooperation

02:02:16.650 --> 02:02:20.930
but there was also an awareness
of the world who were living in.

02:02:20.930 --> 02:02:23.110
And that was a part of
what it was all about.

02:02:23.110 --> 02:02:27.070
I got involved in it because
of a guy named Ralph Rinzler

02:02:27.070 --> 02:02:29.340
who some of you who
worked with the library

02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:32.000
or the Smithsonian may know.

02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:36.390
Ralph eventually became deputy
director of the Smithsonian

02:02:36.390 --> 02:02:37.690
or something like that.

02:02:37.690 --> 02:02:40.740
He's responsible
for the Festival --

02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:44.490
Smithsonian Festival
on the mall every year.

02:02:44.490 --> 02:02:47.990
I got to know him through
the Newport Folk Foundation.

02:02:47.990 --> 02:02:50.680
I was the director of
the Newport Folk Festival

02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:52.750
and Ralph worked for us.

02:02:52.750 --> 02:02:56.020
He would scout talent and
he would, occasionally

02:02:56.020 --> 02:03:00.610
when we had projects, he would
run the -- not run the projects.

02:03:00.610 --> 02:03:02.490
Ralph wasn't kind of
guy who'd run things.

02:03:02.490 --> 02:03:04.110
He was the kind of
guy who would go in

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:06.240
and say, "How can I help you?"

02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:09.620
or "I have access
to these resources.

02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:11.500
Is there a way I can
help you use them?"

02:03:11.500 --> 02:03:17.030
And that will figure in the
story I'm about to tell you.

02:03:17.030 --> 02:03:20.400
And he came to us one day,
one of our board meetings

02:03:20.400 --> 02:03:22.640
and he'd been in
touch with SCLC.

02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.660
And he said, "One of the
things they could use is a

02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:29.740
music program."

02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.730
Because they realized there's
a lot of adults who are going

02:03:32.730 --> 02:03:34.980
to be there who aren't going
to have a lot to do at night.

02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:38.270
And they're are going to
be a lot of kids there

02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:42.230
who aren't going to
have a lot to do at all.

02:03:42.230 --> 02:03:44.150
So could we set something up?

02:03:44.150 --> 02:03:46.190
And so Frederick Douglass --

02:03:46.190 --> 02:03:48.860
Reverend Frederick
Douglas Kirkpatrick,

02:03:48.860 --> 02:03:51.110
who was mentioned
a little while ago.

02:03:51.110 --> 02:03:53.850
Kirk had been part
of an organization

02:03:53.850 --> 02:03:57.000
in Louisiana called the
Deacons for Defense.

02:03:57.000 --> 02:04:01.050
They banded together and routed
a group of white nationalists,

02:04:01.050 --> 02:04:04.800
much to the chagrin of
the white nationalists.

02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:06.100
He was a lovely guy.

02:04:06.100 --> 02:04:07.400
I liked him a lot.

02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:10.200
And he was a Newport
board too by then.

02:04:10.200 --> 02:04:14.050
So Kirk came down, Georgia
Sea Islands singers came

02:04:14.050 --> 02:04:16.560
and we all came down.

02:04:16.560 --> 02:04:20.950
Ralph and I came and we met
with the SCLC leadership.

02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:25.670
When the Newport board decided
to do this, it was a meeting

02:04:25.670 --> 02:04:30.460
at which Alan Lomax, the
folklorist was not present.

02:04:30.460 --> 02:04:35.580
And we were all really happy
about that, because Alan is --

02:04:35.580 --> 02:04:40.060
Alan had a good heart but he
was a pushy son of a bitch.

02:04:40.060 --> 02:04:45.810
And so, so we didn't tell him
we were doing it, and everybody,

02:04:45.810 --> 02:04:49.210
and everybody told
everybody, do not tell Alan,

02:04:49.210 --> 02:04:50.990
you know do not issue
the minutes

02:04:50.990 --> 02:04:52.770
of this meeting, nothing.

02:04:52.770 --> 02:04:57.020
So Ralph and I are meeting
and you'll see some pictures

02:04:57.020 --> 02:05:00.790
in a moment, Washington
is burned out, during,

02:05:00.790 --> 02:05:04.300
it's just desolation, road
to [inaudible] to that,

02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:08.440
that's the LC office was just,
it, it was -- it was like being,

02:05:08.440 --> 02:05:10.430
it was a bombed out city.

02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:12.920
And so we're meeting
with everybody,

02:05:12.920 --> 02:05:16.620
and Ralph is saying how can I
help you if we have this money,

02:05:16.620 --> 02:05:19.830
and we have connections to
these [inaudible], these people.

02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:25.830
And Alan burst into the room
and proceeds to lecture them

02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:28.920
on the importance
of black music,

02:05:28.920 --> 02:05:31.530
on the character of black music.

02:05:31.530 --> 02:05:35.680
And tells them what they
should do with black music.

02:05:35.680 --> 02:05:39.960
And as Alan spoke, his Texas
accent got thicker and thicker,

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:43.410
which is something he
tended to do I noticed

02:05:43.410 --> 02:05:44.710
when he's with black people.

02:05:44.710 --> 02:05:47.030
And it would start out,
sort of talking like this

02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:49.330
and by the end he's
talking like that.

02:05:49.330 --> 02:05:54.540
And so the room is
getting colder and colder.

02:05:54.540 --> 02:05:57.120
Ralph and I want to
slide under the table.

02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:00.710
We just think we are
dead, the project is dead.

02:06:00.710 --> 02:06:02.800
And it was such a sweet
project, you know doing things

02:06:02.800 --> 02:06:04.780
for your kids is so nice.

02:06:04.780 --> 02:06:10.100
And so Jim Bevel says to
Ralph and me, you guys got

02:06:10.100 --> 02:06:11.900
to do something about that boy.

02:06:11.900 --> 02:06:16.040
[ Laughter ]

02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:19.000
Ralph says, well he means well.

02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.560
Bill, Bevel says, yeah.

02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:24.080
So anyhow it all came together.

02:06:24.080 --> 02:06:30.320
It, it, it got fixed,
it, it came together.

02:06:30.320 --> 02:06:31.820
And a while later.

02:06:31.820 --> 02:06:33.120
And I -- after this time,

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:36.770
I don't remember how many days
later, we went down to set

02:06:36.770 --> 02:06:38.380
up the, for the program.

02:06:38.380 --> 02:06:41.280
And I, I was just there for
the first few days of it.

02:06:41.280 --> 02:06:43.230
So what I'm going to show
you, just some pictures

02:06:43.230 --> 02:06:44.600
from those first few days.

02:06:44.600 --> 02:06:48.840
And then I came back
for the solidarity date.

02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:51.060
And I wanted to say something
about that though, I'm,

02:06:51.060 --> 02:06:53.730
I'm going to hold
that off a little bit.

02:06:53.730 --> 02:06:55.290
That's Ralph.

02:06:55.290 --> 02:06:58.340
And that is a, a
Newport Folk Festival.

02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:01.200
I didn't have any
pictures of him thee.

02:07:01.200 --> 02:07:05.170
And he's the sweetest
guy as, as he looks like.

02:07:05.170 --> 02:07:07.570
This is the photograph
out of the --

02:07:07.570 --> 02:07:09.750
out of the cab window
on the way.

02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:12.630
And that's another
photograph that some

02:07:12.630 --> 02:07:16.510
of you remember walking
and looking at that.

02:07:16.510 --> 02:07:19.140
And this was when
I first got there.

02:07:19.140 --> 02:07:23.390
And those were the first
times anybody ever said to me,

02:07:23.390 --> 02:07:27.230
a guy came over and he said I
keep looking at that and I think

02:07:27.230 --> 02:07:30.700
of a Klansman looking
down at me all the time.

02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.550
And I had never looked at the
Washington monument since,

02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:39.200
and not thought of this Klansman
looking down at me all the time.

02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.250
And now, you know, it towers
all over that part of the city.

02:07:43.250 --> 02:07:47.650
And there's some
significance in that.

02:07:47.650 --> 02:07:51.060
So it, oh and, and the
first few days it was almost

02:07:51.060 --> 02:07:52.360
entirely black.

02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.320
The, the buses hadn't come yet.

02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:57.880
One of the things we decided to
do by the way in addition to,

02:07:57.880 --> 02:08:02.790
it says this music program, was
to document what we were doing.

02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:06.470
So those recordings that
are in the library would,

02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:07.970
we recorded the performances.

02:08:07.970 --> 02:08:12.540
You'll see some newsmen in
a moment, I got one of them

02:08:12.540 --> 02:08:15.600
to give me a copy of all his
tapes of the first meeting

02:08:15.600 --> 02:08:18.580
of Resurrection City,
which was really fiery,

02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:20.080
it was really great.

02:08:20.080 --> 02:08:23.200
Kirk performed, other
people performed afterwards.

02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:27.940
And another folk who was hired
by Newport, Henry Glassy,

02:08:27.940 --> 02:08:32.490
road with one of the bus
trains coming from California.

02:08:32.490 --> 02:08:34.870
And he did interviews
on the way.

02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:37.990
So we had some documentation
to stuff

02:08:37.990 --> 02:08:40.760
that would not, not
otherwise exist.

02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:42.610
And to get another
thing that's pleased me

02:08:42.610 --> 02:08:46.910
about being here today is seeing
how you guys have been able

02:08:46.910 --> 02:08:51.900
to use that material around,
you know, everybody else who was

02:08:51.900 --> 02:08:55.710
on that board with me would
be absolutely delighted.

02:08:55.710 --> 02:08:59.470
Those are the A framed ends
arriving that you can see a lot

02:08:59.470 --> 02:09:04.350
of local volunteers were
involved in that work.

02:09:04.350 --> 02:09:05.870
There were a lot of
people in Washington

02:09:05.870 --> 02:09:09.990
who were helping set
up Resurrection City.

02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:14.770
And you can see its
setting them up.

02:09:14.770 --> 02:09:19.430
And a lot of the A frames had
graffiti on it, but not the kind

02:09:19.430 --> 02:09:22.280
of graffiti you see nowadays.

02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:27.090
It, graffiti, I've
been to the mountain.

02:09:27.090 --> 02:09:29.800
People's names, quotes, there
are a number of quotations

02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:32.440
from Dr. King you would
see, you'd see on houses.

02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:39.020
And I think the names
of some of the people

02:09:39.020 --> 02:09:41.360
in CLC are on that building.

02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:46.210
I always loved this picture,
this guy with his kid just with,

02:09:46.210 --> 02:09:49.800
they just look so happy I guess.

02:09:49.800 --> 02:09:51.380
And I, I said there's a feeling

02:09:51.380 --> 02:09:54.290
of people just feeling
optimistic and good,

02:09:54.290 --> 02:09:55.990
and this is one of
those pictures there

02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:58.350
that is like that.

02:09:58.350 --> 02:10:00.410
This was in the tent.

02:10:00.410 --> 02:10:03.490
And this is in the tent
of the first town meeting.

02:10:03.490 --> 02:10:06.720
I don't think it was
called the Soul Tent yet.

02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:12.330
That may have arrived after a
lot of music was performed there

02:10:12.330 --> 02:10:14.530
and people said that's
Soul Town.

02:10:14.530 --> 02:10:18.950
But this point it was just it.

02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:21.470
That guy in the poncho
you'll see a moment,

02:10:21.470 --> 02:10:22.820
there he's, he's on the right.

02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:24.250
His name is Sweet Willy.

02:10:24.250 --> 02:10:29.880
Sweet Willy had lost an arm in
Vietnam, and he's on the tape.

02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:31.840
He was an incredible speaker.

02:10:31.840 --> 02:10:35.950
You can see that guy with
him, just adoring people.

02:10:35.950 --> 02:10:38.490
And I, I was [inaudible]
Sweet Willy.

02:10:38.490 --> 02:10:40.970
I think the, the
only white guys I saw

02:10:40.970 --> 02:10:47.210
in the tent were the newsmen
and Alan Lomax and, and me,

02:10:47.210 --> 02:10:50.330
there may have been others,
but I didn't notice them.

02:10:50.330 --> 02:10:54.010
But I said other people started
coming and this is Kirk paying.

02:10:54.010 --> 02:10:56.630
Again he was so neat.

02:10:56.630 --> 02:11:00.090
And these are kids who were just
digging it, they just liked it.

02:11:00.090 --> 02:11:01.460
There were a lot of kids.

02:11:01.460 --> 02:11:04.890
And this is the, the gondola
of the news guy sitting there

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:08.540
in the center of it during it.

02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:13.610
Over the telephone wire in there
you see a slightly oblong object

02:11:13.610 --> 02:11:14.910
over the guide.

02:11:14.910 --> 02:11:17.370
By the way, it was a
little mud there already,

02:11:17.370 --> 02:11:19.040
I don't remember it
raining but it looks

02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:22.970
like it was anticipating
what was going to happen.

02:11:22.970 --> 02:11:25.630
And there is the object,

02:11:25.630 --> 02:11:28.150
it's some kids playing
with a football.

02:11:28.150 --> 02:11:32.740
And that's Alan Lomax and
Kirk carrying the song sheets

02:11:32.740 --> 02:11:35.720
which had been prepared
by people

02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:39.930
at a publication
called Broadside.

02:11:39.930 --> 02:11:42.220
They put together
a number of songs.

02:11:42.220 --> 02:11:46.070
And the library has some now,
I've written them down with me.

02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:48.440
And they contain some
traditional songs

02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:50.570
and adaptations to
some traditional songs

02:11:50.570 --> 02:11:53.040
and a number of songs by Kirk.

02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:56.440
And that's Kirk again.

02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:00.190
And he would -- he would
do this all day long.

02:12:00.190 --> 02:12:02.520
That's Bessie Jones and
Georgia C. Highland.

02:12:02.520 --> 02:12:05.680
And that's at Ralph
Winkler's house.

02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:07.900
We heard Libya Cotton
before singing,

02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:10.040
oh Libya worked for Ralph.

02:12:10.040 --> 02:12:13.120
Libya played guitar left
handed, used to drive me crazy.

02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.920
I had [inaudible].

02:12:14.920 --> 02:12:20.090
[ Laughter ]

02:12:20.090 --> 02:12:23.420
He was one of the, Georgia
C. Highland singers,

02:12:23.420 --> 02:12:25.070
and what he sang to me there,

02:12:25.070 --> 02:12:32.120
that afternoon they had taken
him over to the rotunda.

02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:33.720
They'd been -- they'd
been on the capital

02:12:33.720 --> 02:12:36.140
and he'd been in the rotunda.

02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:41.610
And he said, I know why these
people are so screwed up,

02:12:41.610 --> 02:12:44.280
they got their big round room.

02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:47.380
You can't get your head
right in a big round room.

02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:49.510
You need to know
where the corners are.

02:12:49.510 --> 02:12:56.100
[ Laughter ]

02:12:56.100 --> 02:12:57.970
And this was in the tent.

02:12:57.970 --> 02:12:59.270
And this is the kind of thing

02:12:59.270 --> 02:13:01.230
that you just saw
there all the time.

02:13:01.230 --> 02:13:04.090
People just playing in the pool.

02:13:04.090 --> 02:13:05.420
People being by a pool.

02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:10.020
This was some tourist kid, and
this was a kid out of the camp.

02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:12.880
And they were wondering --
By the why where camp was,

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:14.300
where Resurrection City was

02:13:14.300 --> 02:13:16.900
if you didn't know the
site, reflecting pool.

02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:19.540
And this is a stand of trees.

02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:21.310
And Resurrection City
is the other side

02:13:21.310 --> 02:13:22.880
of the stand of trees.

02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:24.200
You could walk around the pool

02:13:24.200 --> 02:13:26.020
and not see it if
you didn't look.

02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:28.850
If you didn't want to know it
was there you could pretend it

02:13:28.850 --> 02:13:30.150
wasn't there.

02:13:30.150 --> 02:13:31.450
So there would be
tourists around there,

02:13:31.450 --> 02:13:33.330
they just drove around,
having no idea

02:13:33.330 --> 02:13:37.580
that there was 3,000 people
you know 15 yards away.

02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:43.830
This is the beginning --
this is Solidarity Day.

02:13:43.830 --> 02:13:46.950
And I was always really happy
they called it Solidarity Day

02:13:46.950 --> 02:13:50.710
rather than [inaudible] Day
because that's what it was.

02:13:50.710 --> 02:13:53.840
Resurrection City, as you
heard before, was a --

02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.800
it involved black people, it
involved Native Americans,

02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:03.820
it involved Hispanics,
it involved white people.

02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:05.770
And what brought people
together was poverty.

02:14:05.770 --> 02:14:10.690
And I think it's the first major
event of that kind that brought

02:14:10.690 --> 02:14:14.710
so many people together
and made them aware

02:14:14.710 --> 02:14:17.030
that they shared
things in common

02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:21.080
that might be working
along in common.

02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:24.650
Solidarity Day went
one step further,

02:14:24.650 --> 02:14:27.210
because the union showed up.

02:14:27.210 --> 02:14:30.270
And the unions had been
notably absent from much

02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:32.430
of the civil rights stuff.

02:14:32.430 --> 02:14:35.410
And I mentioned several of
them before, there's one more

02:14:35.410 --> 02:14:42.810
that I forgot to mention, and
that was October 22, 1963.

02:14:42.810 --> 02:14:46.650
And October 22, 1963 was the day

02:14:46.650 --> 02:14:52.700
of the first six digit antiwar
demonstration in Washington.

02:14:52.700 --> 02:14:55.510
There had been antiwar
movements, I think it's going

02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:58.050
on for the last year and a half.

02:14:58.050 --> 02:15:00.040
But that was a big one.

02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:03.740
And one of the things that was
in the air, part of the spirit

02:15:03.740 --> 02:15:07.140
of all of us I think,
was that what was going

02:15:07.140 --> 02:15:09.790
on with the antiwar
movement, what was going

02:15:09.790 --> 02:15:12.190
on with the voting rights
movement, what was going

02:15:12.190 --> 02:15:15.140
on with poverty movement,
we had things

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:17.530
in common with each other.

02:15:17.530 --> 02:15:21.750
And it wasn't all, you
know, use your, you here,

02:15:21.750 --> 02:15:23.100
you here and you there.

02:15:23.100 --> 02:15:25.250
That, the -- some
of the things wrong

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:29.890
in the world we didn't have
to change too many nouns.

02:15:29.890 --> 02:15:32.020
It just kind of filled
the energy.

02:15:32.020 --> 02:15:34.450
And so this crowd reminded me

02:15:34.450 --> 02:15:36.880
of that crowd only
seven months earlier,

02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:39.290
in exactly the same place.

02:15:39.290 --> 02:15:42.410
And this crowd, as you'll
notice, everybody's there.

02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:44.980
All kinds of people.

02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:53.040
And at this one I was not
a participant, I was a --

02:15:53.040 --> 02:15:56.790
demonstrations like this unless,
unless you happened to luck

02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:59.460
out with I'd been to
the mountain and one

02:15:59.460 --> 02:16:01.430
of those which is very rare.

02:16:01.430 --> 02:16:02.880
You don't listen
to the speeches,

02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:04.700
you can't hear them
most of the time.

02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:08.170
What you're doing is you're
bearing witness with your body

02:16:08.170 --> 02:16:11.970
to say this matters I want to
be here with these other people,

02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:14.940
count us you son of a
bitch, we're watching you.

02:16:14.940 --> 02:16:18.530
And that's what was
going on there.

02:16:24.050 --> 02:16:25.370
There's that Klansman again.

02:16:25.370 --> 02:16:28.300
That, now that's Abernathy's at
the microphone and [inaudible]

02:16:28.300 --> 02:16:29.600
and Coretta Scott King.

02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:32.880
I only realized when I
was making these prints,

02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:34.770
she there she is,
I only realized --

02:16:34.770 --> 02:16:37.940
I never realized
before she was in there.

02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.240
I knew she must have
been there and I,

02:16:39.240 --> 02:16:41.040
and I had never looked
until last week, I --

02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:47.410
[ Inaudible ]

02:16:47.410 --> 02:16:48.710
Yeah right.

02:16:48.710 --> 02:16:53.510
Oh I'm sure if I blew up that
across the, there would be a lot

02:16:53.510 --> 02:16:54.810
of people you could name it.

02:16:54.810 --> 02:16:56.440
And there's the press again.

02:16:56.440 --> 02:17:02.030
Some guys got into trouble
after this happened.

02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:05.350
Oh and this picture
I really liked.

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:10.770
This could have been a 1930's
WPA picture with those hats.

02:17:10.770 --> 02:17:13.500
And again, people
of all ages at it.

02:17:13.500 --> 02:17:19.420
And labor people, people from
just all kinds of things.

02:17:19.420 --> 02:17:24.020
This guy, a lot of white
guys with crossed arms.

02:17:24.020 --> 02:17:27.040
And, and she, she looks so cool.

02:17:27.040 --> 02:17:28.510
I love her body language.

02:17:28.510 --> 02:17:30.360
And, and his.

02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:33.830
And you see -- you see those
guys down by the street, those,

02:17:33.830 --> 02:17:36.710
those two guys in the left
with their crossed arms?

02:17:36.710 --> 02:17:38.450
They work for somebody.

02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:43.510
You know you, they, they weren't
there enjoying the venue.

02:17:43.510 --> 02:17:48.040
[ Laughter ]

02:17:48.040 --> 02:17:52.340
And, and again, while this is
going on, the kids being kids.

02:17:52.340 --> 02:17:55.170
So those are the
pictures I took.

02:17:55.170 --> 02:17:57.510
Okay. Thank you.

02:18:05.240 --> 02:18:10.880
Oh push it to the right
it will make a phone call.

02:18:10.880 --> 02:18:12.680
Yeah.

02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.040
[ Inaudible ]

02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:19.340
A little technical.

02:18:27.130 --> 02:18:29.170
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: I don't
trust myself these days

02:18:29.170 --> 02:18:31.970
to remember everything.

02:18:31.970 --> 02:18:34.860
So I've, I've brought
along my notes.

02:18:34.860 --> 02:18:39.090
I'm Reginald Jackson and I'm
really pleased to be here.

02:18:39.090 --> 02:18:40.390
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson: We're related?

02:18:40.390 --> 02:18:41.920
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: I don't
know if we're related or not,

02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:43.840
but we definitely --

02:18:43.840 --> 02:18:48.730
we're definitely bonding
in DC these two days.

02:18:48.730 --> 02:18:55.230
I, I was not familiar with
your work in this way.

02:18:55.230 --> 02:18:56.940
And so it's, it's been great.

02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:58.240
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson: Thanks.

02:18:58.240 --> 02:18:59.540
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: And I'm
really pleased to be here

02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:04.020
with a number of the really
renowned folk who have been able

02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:06.220
to impart a lot of information

02:19:06.220 --> 02:19:10.640
that I heretofore hadn't really
had access to in this manner.

02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:15.000
So I'm really pleased and
honored to be on this panel.

02:19:15.000 --> 02:19:19.110
And I'd like to thank the
Library for, you know,

02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:20.410
pulling this together.

02:19:20.410 --> 02:19:25.510
This is -- this has been
a great opportunity.

02:19:25.510 --> 02:19:31.250
[ Applause ]

02:19:31.250 --> 02:19:35.150
This work I've been
told I should try

02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:40.300
to give you the context and
what I was doing prior to going

02:19:40.300 --> 02:19:43.170
to the, the Poor
People's Campaign.

02:19:43.170 --> 02:19:48.640
And you know what I saw
obviously, as well as how

02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:50.980
that affected and
influenced the work

02:19:50.980 --> 02:19:53.800
that I have been doing since.

02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:58.210
And so I'm going to give
you sort of the nature

02:19:58.210 --> 02:20:05.960
of a visual tour through
my work and that is pre --

02:20:05.960 --> 02:20:09.500
predominately documentary
in, in nature.

02:20:09.500 --> 02:20:14.910
And at this event was really the
first attempt that I had made

02:20:14.910 --> 02:20:19.370
to go to, as a graduate
student in New Haven,

02:20:19.370 --> 02:20:22.270
was a graduate student in the
School of Art and Architecture.

02:20:22.270 --> 02:20:24.190
Studying graphic design.

02:20:24.190 --> 02:20:29.520
And I happen to have been in, in
a documentary photography class

02:20:29.520 --> 02:20:33.120
with Walker Evans who I later
discovered was the father

02:20:33.120 --> 02:20:35.410
of documentary photography.

02:20:35.410 --> 02:20:41.850
And, and being the kind of
upstart rebellious type,

02:20:41.850 --> 02:20:49.680
I had gotten involved in,
in the organization of,

02:20:49.680 --> 02:20:54.950
and I'm steering away from my
notes here, of an institution

02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:59.340
within the institution at Yale,
called the Black Workshop.

02:20:59.340 --> 02:21:04.320
Yale had, had the
foresight to understand

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:10.540
that cities were being
reconfigured, and I'm talking

02:21:10.540 --> 02:21:13.670
like the, the mid '60s.

02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:15.370
And the School of Architecture,

02:21:15.370 --> 02:21:18.670
Charles Moore was the
head of that school.

02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:21.500
And they were sort of building
monuments to themselves,

02:21:21.500 --> 02:21:26.900
in terms of some of the
architectural designs

02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:30.150
that were being executed
during those days.

02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:35.170
And so a group of us
sort of connected,

02:21:35.170 --> 02:21:38.050
formed what we called the
Black Workshop, and were able

02:21:38.050 --> 02:21:42.680
to get the university to
find us a space outside

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:47.300
of the school house, and we
were able to bring in people

02:21:47.300 --> 02:21:49.130
who we thought were experts.

02:21:49.130 --> 02:21:53.250
And we spent a lot of
time in the street.

02:21:53.250 --> 02:21:56.560
We were in Newark, New
Jersey, helping to develop one

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:59.560
of the first daycare complexes.

02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:02.250
We were in Boston and Chinatown.

02:22:02.250 --> 02:22:05.960
We're predominately city
planners and architects.

02:22:05.960 --> 02:22:08.830
And I was the, sort of
the lone visual guy.

02:22:08.830 --> 02:22:11.570
I was learning graphic
design, but I was headed

02:22:11.570 --> 02:22:13.910
into photography and film.

02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:18.340
And so I became the one who
documented what every --

02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:20.280
everything that was going on.

02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:26.390
And so these images
really were the --

02:22:26.390 --> 02:22:29.140
that was really the foundation
for, for the work that I,

02:22:29.140 --> 02:22:31.440
that I moved on to do.

02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:43.250
This one, okay.

02:22:43.250 --> 02:22:48.770
I got to, to, to
here, Washington DC

02:22:48.770 --> 02:22:53.050
because as I had said
earlier, I, I, I'd really felt

02:22:53.050 --> 02:22:58.500
that I needed to
be actively doing.

02:22:58.500 --> 02:23:04.450
And I left the class, got
on a plane, came down here,

02:23:04.450 --> 02:23:08.550
checked into the Holiday
Inn and, and spent a couple

02:23:08.550 --> 02:23:15.340
of days making images and, and
that was really my first attempt

02:23:15.340 --> 02:23:22.920
to use the camera to, to -- in a
serious way cover a march and a,

02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:27.150
and a situation like this.

02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:32.320
So I, nevertheless I made my way
through the city engaging folks,

02:23:32.320 --> 02:23:35.830
making portrait's, looking
for images supporting,

02:23:35.830 --> 02:23:39.570
supporting activities going
on including a baptism,

02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:42.240
food preparation, a barbershop.

02:23:42.240 --> 02:23:45.730
I really, I recall generally
trying to capture images

02:23:45.730 --> 02:23:49.100
that would attempt to tell a
story of life in the village

02:23:49.100 --> 02:23:51.670
as well as during the march.

02:23:59.040 --> 02:24:02.520
The theme of the march and
encampment, as we all know,

02:24:02.520 --> 02:24:05.670
came from Dr. King's vision
to create a broad coalition

02:24:05.670 --> 02:24:09.120
of workers to highlight the
gross inequities our system

02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:11.020
of democracy fosters.

02:24:11.020 --> 02:24:15.390
His assassination just months
before had, had made --

02:24:15.390 --> 02:24:17.630
had been tied directly
to his emphasis

02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:20.620
on the economic injustice
I felt.

02:24:20.620 --> 02:24:22.330
Today the question can be asked,

02:24:22.330 --> 02:24:26.740
has the situation gotten any
better, or is it worse in terms

02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:30.110
of economic divide that exists

02:24:30.110 --> 02:24:33.260
between the haves
and the have nots.

02:24:33.260 --> 02:24:39.930
And this, this graphic
speaks to a recent survey

02:24:39.930 --> 02:24:43.870
that was done in, in
Boston by the Boston Globe.

02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:48.980
And really is, is,
is startling to --

02:24:48.980 --> 02:24:54.010
when we understand that
in a city like Boston,

02:24:54.010 --> 02:25:01.070
that the net worth of, of a,
of a black family is, is $8.

02:25:01.070 --> 02:25:07.130
And that we really
have to push, push on.

02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:12.630
We really have to, to address
and, and many of the ways

02:25:12.630 --> 02:25:18.870
that were discussed
earlier this vast dichotomy.

02:25:18.870 --> 02:25:24.540
As I mentioned, I'm on the
right there, and I'm --

02:25:24.540 --> 02:25:27.330
this is our, part of our
black workshop in New Haven

02:25:27.330 --> 02:25:30.180
which was in it's infancy.

02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:32.890
And it was really, as I've
mentioned, my launching pad

02:25:32.890 --> 02:25:38.100
into coming down
here to do this work.

02:25:38.100 --> 02:25:41.060
And as a graduate student, I
was learning the discipline

02:25:41.060 --> 02:25:45.570
of graphic design but
was also shooting a film

02:25:45.570 --> 02:25:51.500
on my experiences, which I later
used to get my certificate,

02:25:51.500 --> 02:25:55.900
my degree to get out of Yale.

02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:00.490
And, and which served, you know,

02:26:00.490 --> 02:26:04.230
that Black Workshop continued
ten years after we left.

02:26:04.230 --> 02:26:07.700
So we were actually involved
in recruiting students.

02:26:07.700 --> 02:26:10.850
We were involved in
shaping the curriculum.

02:26:10.850 --> 02:26:17.470
Where up and down on a book
that we're writing at the moment

02:26:17.470 --> 02:26:23.890
from '68 to '70, which talks
about how we had some impact

02:26:23.890 --> 02:26:27.110
on an institution like
Yale and other institutions

02:26:27.110 --> 02:26:30.940
in the country, teach
architecture.

02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:37.190
The, the notion that you learn
a discipline and then you go

02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:43.540
to the client and give the
client what you think the client

02:26:43.540 --> 02:26:48.090
should have was the way
architecture had been taught

02:26:48.090 --> 02:26:49.440
for many, many years.

02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:55.580
And so our group began
to make major adjustments

02:26:55.580 --> 02:26:59.670
to that practice and, and
we're beginning to understand,

02:26:59.670 --> 02:27:03.400
you know, what our role was
during that time in New Haven.

02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:06.190
We, we, we thought
everything kind

02:27:06.190 --> 02:27:08.720
of centered in, in New Haven.

02:27:08.720 --> 02:27:11.970
We, we had -- we had the,
the Panther trial was going

02:27:11.970 --> 02:27:15.030
on with Bobby Seale,
the Alex Rackley case

02:27:15.030 --> 02:27:18.030
that sprung up out of that.

02:27:18.030 --> 02:27:22.380
The Panther office was maybe
two or three doors down from

02:27:22.380 --> 02:27:28.840
where we resided as
the Black Workshop.

02:27:28.840 --> 02:27:34.490
And this is an image of, of,
of one of the many gatherings

02:27:34.490 --> 02:27:39.780
in front of the office there.

02:27:39.780 --> 02:27:43.530
Getting back to Resurrection
City,

02:27:43.530 --> 02:27:50.320
we can see here the attempt
to, to mark space as well

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:59.390
as to indicate the, the nature
of the climatic conditions

02:27:59.390 --> 02:28:06.050
which means that the sneakers
being hung for dry on the line.

02:28:06.050 --> 02:28:16.060
And but this is just a, a view
of as far as one could see.

02:28:16.060 --> 02:28:19.040
And, and I'm going to look at
that to the end of that image.

02:28:19.040 --> 02:28:20.340
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: To see
if you can find [inaudible].

02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:21.640
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson:
A different,

02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:22.940
a different way from now.

02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:24.240
I'm talking about --

02:28:24.240 --> 02:28:25.540
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Oh into the [inaudible].

02:28:25.540 --> 02:28:26.840
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson:
I'm talking about the,

02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:28.200
the yeah the monument.

02:28:28.200 --> 02:28:33.950
And you know once again
signage means a lot.

02:28:33.950 --> 02:28:37.930
And, and that spoke to
the, the need for security,

02:28:37.930 --> 02:28:43.260
which I hadn't really thought
about or anticipated and,

02:28:46.130 --> 02:28:50.820
and the repetition of the
feed, of ending hunger.

02:28:50.820 --> 02:29:00.600
This image speaks to the
ability of families to,

02:29:00.600 --> 02:29:06.580
to hang in there, to, to
persevere during that time.

02:29:06.580 --> 02:29:10.180
And the press oddly enough
didn't really say a whole lot,

02:29:10.180 --> 02:29:13.890
I thought, about white
involvement in the,

02:29:13.890 --> 02:29:16.260
in the, in the encampment.

02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:22.120
And so I think, you know,
more and more efforts need

02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:25.960
to show the diversity
that existed there.

02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:33.340
And --

02:29:37.040 --> 02:29:40.400
So we begin to see, you
know a much broader view of,

02:29:40.400 --> 02:29:43.810
of what was going on.

02:29:45.400 --> 02:29:48.750
And finally,

02:29:48.750 --> 02:29:53.900
the intergenerational
nature of folk.

02:29:53.900 --> 02:30:01.780
And a view from, from
within I call this.

02:30:06.050 --> 02:30:08.350
And as far as the eye could see.

02:30:13.050 --> 02:30:19.510
And this image takes us beyond
the march and immediately

02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:22.940
after graduation in 1970,

02:30:22.940 --> 02:30:28.060
I and some colleagues raised a
little bit of money and went off

02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:32.670
to West Africa, Ghana and
Liberia in particular.

02:30:32.670 --> 02:30:43.830
And when I saw the conditions,
particularly in, in Liberia

02:30:43.830 --> 02:30:48.140
and Ghana, I began to
think about my experiences

02:30:48.140 --> 02:30:49.690
that I had just encountered here

02:30:49.690 --> 02:30:51.910
and my experiences
here in the US.

02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:57.810
And I found this, this woman
who, and you know I'm speaking

02:30:57.810 --> 02:31:01.110
about how that impacted
what I later,

02:31:01.110 --> 02:31:03.570
what my vision became later.

02:31:03.570 --> 02:31:09.910
Talks about the, the exploited
nature of the multinationals

02:31:09.910 --> 02:31:18.650
and how corporations and
how they had been able

02:31:18.650 --> 02:31:21.700
to without too much
interruption continue

02:31:21.700 --> 02:31:27.100
to exploit the raw materials
that exists and are extracted

02:31:27.100 --> 02:31:29.550
out of those countries
in West Africa.

02:31:29.550 --> 02:31:38.000
And so this woman's stance to me
speaks of, you know, that, that,

02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:41.810
the courage that's necessary
to try to break that,

02:31:41.810 --> 02:31:44.220
that stronghold,

02:31:44.220 --> 02:31:50.230
the strangulation of,
of these countries.

02:31:50.230 --> 02:31:51.920
Saying enough is enough.

02:31:51.920 --> 02:31:55.060
Like your grandmother
or your mom or you aunt,

02:31:55.060 --> 02:31:57.810
when they put the
hands on their hips,

02:31:57.810 --> 02:32:00.110
you know, enough is enough.

02:32:05.060 --> 02:32:09.870
This is a, you know, as a, as
a visual artist one of the hats

02:32:09.870 --> 02:32:16.860
that I wear, the -- as a
photo collage which I made

02:32:16.860 --> 02:32:22.870
into a poster which reflects
my feelings after leaving Ghana

02:32:22.870 --> 02:32:26.450
and I think I did this in 1972.

02:32:26.450 --> 02:32:28.590
And it, it shows
the trains moving

02:32:28.590 --> 02:32:31.850
out of the country,
going one way.

02:32:31.850 --> 02:32:36.400
It, it shows a man in the bush
with a chicken in one hand,

02:32:36.400 --> 02:32:39.300
and an attaché case
in the other.

02:32:39.300 --> 02:32:45.630
It shows another man with a
child emblazoned on his heart.

02:32:45.630 --> 02:32:51.410
And then you see this young
person, piercing eyes,

02:32:51.410 --> 02:32:58.180
through this tire representing
the, the rubber plantations,

02:32:58.180 --> 02:33:03.790
and various other plantations
that existed and still exist in,

02:33:03.790 --> 02:33:05.680
in parts of West Africa.

02:33:05.680 --> 02:33:11.380
I call it the last frontier.

02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:15.900
This image is part
of a network of ports

02:33:15.900 --> 02:33:18.420
and castles along
the Ghana coast

02:33:18.420 --> 02:33:22.800
that were used during the
Transatlantic slave trade.

02:33:22.800 --> 02:33:29.330
This is Fort Amsterdam built
in the 1600's by the Dutch.

02:33:29.330 --> 02:33:33.360
And consequently over the
years it's been switched back

02:33:33.360 --> 02:33:37.390
and forth, one country would,
would come and capture the fort

02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:40.980
and they'd name it something
else and then they would be,

02:33:40.980 --> 02:33:42.680
it would, would go
back and forth.

02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:51.380
And so this image I feel is
important to, to show that many

02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:54.210
of the, the ancestors of
African Americans passed

02:33:54.210 --> 02:33:57.750
through these forts
along the Ghana coast.

02:33:57.750 --> 02:34:05.720
And the, that is an important
connector to this image.

02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:09.810
This is an image of the
African meeting house in Boston.

02:34:09.810 --> 02:34:15.960
It's a photo serigraph that
I was commissioned to do

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.220
for the Bicentennial in Boston.

02:34:18.220 --> 02:34:25.930
And it's, it employs the sort
of iconographic ivory pendant

02:34:25.930 --> 02:34:28.310
that was sacked from
the City of Bennie

02:34:28.310 --> 02:34:30.140
at the turn of the last century.

02:34:30.140 --> 02:34:35.890
And I'm superimposed this image
over the African Meeting House,

02:34:35.890 --> 02:34:40.300
which is the oldest church
built by all black labor

02:34:40.300 --> 02:34:44.480
in the United States,
still standing, 1806.

02:34:44.480 --> 02:34:49.280
And another part
of my journey is,

02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:51.650
has been dealing
with the homeless.

02:34:51.650 --> 02:34:57.670
And this is an image that shows
a connection to institutions

02:34:57.670 --> 02:35:02.040
that were, were formed
to, to help the needy.

02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:08.700
I began to do work in the
community on homelessness

02:35:08.700 --> 02:35:12.780
and produced this book along
with a Mass Association

02:35:12.780 --> 02:35:16.530
for Mental Health as an
integrated approach to,

02:35:16.530 --> 02:35:19.720
to dealing with services
surrounding the homeless.

02:35:19.720 --> 02:35:23.020
This would have been
the early '80s.

02:35:23.020 --> 02:35:26.410
This is one of the images that
I made on the street of a woman,

02:35:26.410 --> 02:35:30.840
Inez, who was homeless
and who, who lived once --

02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:33.810
who actually had
property on Beacon Hill

02:35:33.810 --> 02:35:36.460
at one point, who is homeless.

02:35:36.460 --> 02:35:42.400
And this is a current photograph
of the Poor People's Campaign

02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:47.690
in Boston at the state house
on Monday, this, this week.

02:35:47.690 --> 02:35:51.620
Another view.

02:35:51.620 --> 02:35:55.110
And finally, this is a
poster that I created

02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:58.120
for an antiracism organization
that I've been working

02:35:58.120 --> 02:36:04.590
for as I left Simmons
back in the '90s.

02:36:04.590 --> 02:36:07.560
And it, it says, I don't know
if you can make it out, it says,

02:36:07.560 --> 02:36:10.910
we don't want our chains
made more bearable,

02:36:10.910 --> 02:36:13.130
we want them removed.

02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:19.680
And that has been an image that
has been used throughout the,

02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:24.460
the course of this
community change organization.

02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:31.100
So this is an example of how I,
how I have traversed this course

02:36:31.100 --> 02:36:34.780
since my days in the '60s.

02:36:34.780 --> 02:36:37.510
That's it.

02:36:37.510 --> 02:36:44.830
[ Applause ]

02:36:44.830 --> 02:36:46.710
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson: Hello.

02:36:46.710 --> 02:36:49.010
The right hand button, F.

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:57.940
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter:
Hello everyone.

02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:00.770
Good morning or good
afternoon, I don't have a clock.

02:37:00.770 --> 02:37:03.810
&gt;&gt; Bruce Jackson:
Good afternoon.

02:37:03.810 --> 02:37:05.470
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter:
Good afternoon.

02:37:05.470 --> 02:37:08.620
It's just, it's been
wonderful seeing both Bruce's

02:37:08.620 --> 02:37:11.760
and Reginald's images
because it just,

02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:15.060
it shows me as I've been going
through archives it's just,

02:37:15.060 --> 02:37:19.370
and some ways the visual
literacy that we have

02:37:19.370 --> 02:37:22.260
about the Poor People's Campaign
and Resurrection City is,

02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:25.580
is narrow, and so it's wonderful
to see these images to,

02:37:25.580 --> 02:37:27.440
to show us that there's
so much more

02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:31.680
that we can learn
through, through images.

02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:32.980
Okay. Thank you.

02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:36.890
So I have approached
the commemoration

02:37:36.890 --> 02:37:39.810
of the 50th Anniversary
of 1960 as well

02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:42.900
as the historian and,
and as a curator.

02:37:42.900 --> 02:37:48.060
Back in 2016, I decided that DC,
which is where I'm from needed

02:37:48.060 --> 02:37:52.620
to have a yearlong commemoration
of the entire year of 1968.

02:37:52.620 --> 02:37:54.080
And you get to have
a commemoration

02:37:54.080 --> 02:37:57.510
that would highlight
activism, art, architecture,

02:37:57.510 --> 02:38:00.650
and everyday life,
all of which made 1968

02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:02.530
such an incredible
year here in DC.

02:38:02.530 --> 02:38:04.860
And of course these
are all elements

02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:07.390
of the Poor People's Campaign
and the Resurrection City,

02:38:07.390 --> 02:38:09.800
as panelists have been sharing.

02:38:09.800 --> 02:38:11.990
The Commemoration had
to be public facing,

02:38:11.990 --> 02:38:15.150
had to be committed to
providing the public with a full

02:38:15.150 --> 02:38:18.060
and complex exploration
of the city in 1968.

02:38:18.060 --> 02:38:21.410
And it had to be a commemoration
in which Washingtonians

02:38:21.410 --> 02:38:24.830
who were here in 1968,
were actually recognized.

02:38:24.830 --> 02:38:26.880
And finally, it had
to be a commemoration

02:38:26.880 --> 02:38:30.010
that would show others
that DC, as a capital city,

02:38:30.010 --> 02:38:33.370
and as an international capital,
like Kingston, like Mexico,

02:38:33.370 --> 02:38:38.950
like Paris, like Prague also
had much to teach the world.

02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:40.910
And so I approached
this commemorative goal

02:38:40.910 --> 02:38:42.490
as three different ways.

02:38:42.490 --> 02:38:45.570
The first was by convening
a group of culture producers

02:38:45.570 --> 02:38:48.720
from monthly meetings so that
we could meet each other,

02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:51.610
learn about events that
were being planned and also

02:38:51.610 --> 02:38:53.480
to collaborate on events.

02:38:53.480 --> 02:38:55.550
And some of those
culture producers are here

02:38:55.550 --> 02:38:56.850
in the audience.

02:38:56.850 --> 02:39:01.510
And I'm happy, really, really
happy to say that we began 2018

02:39:01.510 --> 02:39:05.700
with a daylong kick off even at
the National Building Museum,

02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:08.710
was a daylong event
where we had symposium.

02:39:08.710 --> 02:39:12.500
There was artists, there
were people sharing objects.

02:39:12.500 --> 02:39:15.870
And there was also the national
symphony orchestra quartet

02:39:15.870 --> 02:39:20.490
actually did an hour long
concert sharing songs

02:39:20.490 --> 02:39:22.210
about human rights.

02:39:22.210 --> 02:39:24.480
It was an amazing,
an amazing event.

02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:26.640
And also really powerful
because as, as I'll talk

02:39:26.640 --> 02:39:29.520
about a little later, that
generally when you think

02:39:29.520 --> 02:39:32.710
about DC in 1968, people
aren't thinking about January

02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:34.370
through December,
particularly the media.

02:39:34.370 --> 02:39:35.860
They're thinking about DC

02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:39.020
in '68 is really April
4th through April 8th.

02:39:39.020 --> 02:39:41.050
So the fact that cultural
producers were able

02:39:41.050 --> 02:39:44.000
to get together and actually
start an event in January,

02:39:44.000 --> 02:39:46.180
I think was really important.

02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:49.370
The second thing
that I've done is to,

02:39:49.370 --> 02:39:53.040
to bring about this
commemorative goal was also

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:57.410
doing extensive research in
archives and libraries here

02:39:57.410 --> 02:40:00.490
in this city, doing extensive
research here at the Library

02:40:00.490 --> 02:40:03.240
of Congress, at the
DC Public Library,

02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:05.610
Howard University
[inaudible] Research Center,

02:40:05.610 --> 02:40:09.040
George Washington University
and a whole host of places.

02:40:09.040 --> 02:40:12.050
And one of the things that
I've also learned as well is

02:40:12.050 --> 02:40:14.580
that there are a range of
Washingtonians individuals

02:40:14.580 --> 02:40:18.740
but also organizations that
also have archives, largely,

02:40:18.740 --> 02:40:20.040
that have not been tapped.

02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:21.340
And so that's one of the things

02:40:21.340 --> 02:40:22.730
that I've been invested
in doing.

02:40:22.730 --> 02:40:25.150
And so I've been reaching
out to native Washingtonians

02:40:25.150 --> 02:40:28.630
for their stories and for their
photographs, because I wanted

02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:31.380
to show how engaged
Washingtonians were

02:40:31.380 --> 02:40:33.690
with their city and
the world around them.

02:40:33.690 --> 02:40:35.680
And of course has been
stated before that none

02:40:35.680 --> 02:40:36.980
of the national events,

02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:39.710
including the Poor People's
Campaign, and Resurrection City,

02:40:39.710 --> 02:40:43.600
could have been executed without
the help of Washingtonians.

02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.000
And the third way of course is
by curating the DC 1968 project

02:40:48.000 --> 02:40:50.900
which Guha alerted,
alluded to earlier.

02:40:50.900 --> 02:40:52.700
And which I developed in part

02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:55.650
to create a visually
compelling counter narrative

02:40:55.650 --> 02:40:59.340
to the hybrid focus on the
uprising after the assassination

02:40:59.340 --> 02:41:01.280
of Reverend, of Reverend
Dr. Martin Luther King,

02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:03.890
Jr. And I'm not going
to do that today,

02:41:03.890 --> 02:41:07.150
and I know you have your phones
off, but if you haven't already,

02:41:07.150 --> 02:41:11.270
all you can do is do a browser
search for Washington DC 1968

02:41:11.270 --> 02:41:16.000
and see what comes up, see
the images that come up.

02:41:16.000 --> 02:41:18.360
Here's the slides.

02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:21.670
In honor of Father's Day,
this is an image of my father,

02:41:21.670 --> 02:41:26.640
Bobby Hale, who was a native
Washingtonian, a Korean War vet,

02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:28.910
and also a lifelong
photographer.

02:41:28.910 --> 02:41:32.820
And I believe this is a selfie
that he took of himself in 1970

02:41:32.820 --> 02:41:34.950
with his beloved Nikon camera.

02:41:34.950 --> 02:41:40.330
So after I told him about
my desire to curate 1968

02:41:40.330 --> 02:41:43.330
for this city, he's very
nonchalant, he's like,

02:41:43.330 --> 02:41:44.630
yeah that's interesting.

02:41:44.630 --> 02:41:47.810
And two weeks later, he brings
me a plain white envelope.

02:41:47.810 --> 02:41:51.190
And inside are more than
a dozen color photographs

02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:55.940
that he had taken of DC in
1968, DC in April and May.

02:41:55.940 --> 02:41:57.640
And the thing that's
interesting is

02:41:57.640 --> 02:41:59.700
that they were all color images.

02:41:59.700 --> 02:42:02.430
And I think that's important.

02:42:02.430 --> 02:42:05.330
His photographs offer an
important visual counter

02:42:05.330 --> 02:42:09.410
narrative to a, what I'm calling
a problematic visual trop.

02:42:09.410 --> 02:42:11.560
I know this academia, but
you have to bear with me.

02:42:11.560 --> 02:42:14.880
A problematic visual
trop often promulgated

02:42:14.880 --> 02:42:17.240
by local media outlets
like the Washington Post,

02:42:17.240 --> 02:42:18.860
a Washingtonian magazine.

02:42:18.860 --> 02:42:23.920
For them, too often DC in 1968
exists in black and white.

02:42:23.920 --> 02:42:26.460
The black and white have
destroyed buildings, smoke,

02:42:26.460 --> 02:42:29.520
the national guard, which
enveloped the city immediately

02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:32.110
after the assassination of
Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King,

02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:35.090
Jr. And obviously black
and white images existed,

02:42:35.090 --> 02:42:38.300
the uprising did exist, but
again what I'm arguing is

02:42:38.300 --> 02:42:41.190
that what they show in a
sense is that that's all

02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:43.320
that existed in DC in 1968.

02:42:43.320 --> 02:42:46.730
That's the only story that
we need to know about 1968.

02:42:46.730 --> 02:42:49.720
And as we've been hearing
there's so, so much more.

02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:52.880
Okay. And so what
they do usually,

02:42:52.880 --> 02:42:55.590
and I haven't actually
put the images up again

02:42:55.590 --> 02:42:58.130
because I think they're, this --

02:42:58.130 --> 02:43:00.360
that's all that you see that
I don't want to participate

02:43:00.360 --> 02:43:03.940
in that perpetuation
of this visual trop,

02:43:03.940 --> 02:43:05.730
so you get this little
fancy design that I've done.

02:43:05.730 --> 02:43:08.780
Maybe Reginald you'll
appreciate this design.

02:43:08.780 --> 02:43:11.700
But anyways, so generally,
general,

02:43:11.700 --> 02:43:13.260
you too Bruce, I apologize.

02:43:13.260 --> 02:43:16.260
So generally what you get is,
is a black and white image,

02:43:16.260 --> 02:43:19.030
again of, of sadness and
bad, and things that are bad.

02:43:19.030 --> 02:43:22.370
And it's contrasted on the
other side with, you know,

02:43:22.370 --> 02:43:26.790
a 2018 color image, usually,
you know a, a property,

02:43:26.790 --> 02:43:31.010
something that's beautiful, you
know something that represents,

02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:32.310
you know, this kind of moment

02:43:32.310 --> 02:43:34.020
of hyper development
and capitalism.

02:43:34.020 --> 02:43:38.330
So again 1968 bad,
2018 color good.

02:43:38.330 --> 02:43:41.050
But you know as I'm suggesting

02:43:41.050 --> 02:43:43.950
that this narrative
is very narrow,

02:43:43.950 --> 02:43:48.030
it's a historical
and problematic.

02:43:48.030 --> 02:43:50.940
We only have to look
at the visual narrative

02:43:50.940 --> 02:43:53.670
of the Poor People's
Campaign and Resurrection City

02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:57.310
to educate the public about
the danger of that visual trop.

02:43:57.310 --> 02:44:00.200
And this danger of this single
story, I'm actually borrowing

02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.120
from Chimamanda and Ngozi
Adichie's work who talks

02:44:03.120 --> 02:44:05.490
about the danger of
the single story.

02:44:05.490 --> 02:44:11.500
And so here is a recent
story from my DC 1968 project

02:44:11.500 --> 02:44:14.800
that beautifully, I think,
links the past and the present.

02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:19.560
This is a 2018 photograph
of a 1968 door insert

02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:22.750
from the Southern Christian
Leadership Campaign,

02:44:22.750 --> 02:44:25.840
Conferences, Poor People's
Campaign Headquarters that was

02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:28.260
at the corner of 14th
and U Streets, Northwest.

02:44:28.260 --> 02:44:30.040
Does anybody who remembers '68,

02:44:30.040 --> 02:44:31.680
does anybody remember
that door insert?

02:44:31.680 --> 02:44:33.540
Okay beautiful.

02:44:33.540 --> 02:44:36.660
So Carmen Gilmore and
Carole Green who were

02:44:36.660 --> 02:44:40.900
in their early 20's in 1968,
on their very first day

02:44:40.900 --> 02:44:44.450
of volunteering at the Poor
People's Campaign Headquarters,

02:44:44.450 --> 02:44:46.090
they met each other.

02:44:46.090 --> 02:44:50.410
They -- Carmen Gilmore was
a switchboard operator,

02:44:50.410 --> 02:44:52.660
and Carole Green was a drive.

02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:55.560
Does anyone remember
Carole Green as a driver?

02:44:55.560 --> 02:44:57.550
You think you remember it okay.

02:44:57.550 --> 02:45:00.980
So on that day, they
became friend, fast friends

02:45:00.980 --> 02:45:05.420
and a friendship that's
lasted for more than 50 years.

02:45:05.420 --> 02:45:08.040
And on that day was the
beginning of a commitment

02:45:08.040 --> 02:45:12.170
to activism that also lasted,
has lasted for 50 years.

02:45:12.170 --> 02:45:14.950
So after the Poor
People's Campaign ended,

02:45:14.950 --> 02:45:18.530
and the headquarters closed,
Green drove by the building

02:45:18.530 --> 02:45:22.050
in his red VW Beetle, and for
some reason he didn't just pass

02:45:22.050 --> 02:45:26.400
by going to his Adams Morgan
apartment and just stay home,

02:45:26.400 --> 02:45:29.950
he actually drove home,
went and grabbed his tools,

02:45:29.950 --> 02:45:32.500
and drove back to
the building to,

02:45:32.500 --> 02:45:35.450
what I'm calling
liberate the door.

02:45:35.450 --> 02:45:37.210
The door insert.

02:45:37.210 --> 02:45:39.780
For some reason decided not
to take the door, but he,

02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:44.340
he somehow was able to, to
take the insert out of the door

02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:47.340
and he drove it back
home in his Beetle.

02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:49.860
And he's kept it for 50 years.

02:45:49.860 --> 02:45:51.340
I mean it's, it's unbelievable.

02:45:51.340 --> 02:45:55.080
And actually just a few
months ago he donated it

02:45:55.080 --> 02:45:58.080
to the Smithsonian at the
Smithsonian Institution.

02:45:58.080 --> 02:46:01.000
So I think it's a
wonderful story.

02:46:01.000 --> 02:46:04.310
And so here is my project.

02:46:04.310 --> 02:46:09.450
This is a screenshot of my
project and featuring images

02:46:09.450 --> 02:46:13.630
that I used and stories that
I wrote about from the 11th

02:46:13.630 --> 02:46:15.660
through the 14th of May.

02:46:15.660 --> 02:46:20.780
So the first story, I
think that's on your right,

02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.600
is a photo of a car with
a sign on it that reads,

02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:26.330
People Power Equals Black Power.

02:46:26.330 --> 02:46:29.120
And this photograph was
taken in front of the 12th

02:46:29.120 --> 02:46:31.840
and U Street office of SNCC,

02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:33.760
the Student Non Violent
Coordinating Committee

02:46:33.760 --> 02:46:35.280
which was just two blocks

02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:38.180
from the Poor People's
Campaign Headquarters.

02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:41.570
The second image is Poor
People's Campaign participants

02:46:41.570 --> 02:46:43.700
walking toward the
official opening

02:46:43.700 --> 02:46:46.920
of Resurrection City
on the 13th.

02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:49.550
And the third is
actually a speaker,

02:46:49.550 --> 02:46:51.420
And I'm hopefully
maybe someone here

02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:53.970
in the audience might
recognize who this speaker is

02:46:53.970 --> 02:46:55.960
because I haven't been
able to do so yet.

02:46:55.960 --> 02:46:58.530
But this is someone who
is one of the speakers

02:46:58.530 --> 02:47:01.880
at the Mother's Day Rally
that took place at the --

02:47:01.880 --> 02:47:06.030
on the 12th of May at
Cardoza High School.

02:47:06.030 --> 02:47:08.190
And I don't know how
well you can see it,

02:47:08.190 --> 02:47:13.060
but Harry Belafonte's spouse
is there at the rally,

02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:15.610
Coretta Scott King is
there at the rally.

02:47:15.610 --> 02:47:17.980
I believe Johnny Tillman of,

02:47:17.980 --> 02:47:19.950
of the National Welfare
Rights Organization a,

02:47:19.950 --> 02:47:22.630
a whole range of
people were there.

02:47:22.630 --> 02:47:25.410
It was an amazing event
with thousands of people.

02:47:25.410 --> 02:47:28.780
Again taking place at a
public high school here in DC.

02:47:28.780 --> 02:47:30.120
And the rally was hosted

02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:32.510
by the National Welfare
Rights Organization.

02:47:32.510 --> 02:47:35.880
And the final photo
is a car emblazoned

02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:38.070
with the Poor People's
Campaign poster.

02:47:38.070 --> 02:47:42.520
Any of you veterans have
a copy of the poster?

02:47:42.520 --> 02:47:43.870
Of that original poster?

02:47:43.870 --> 02:47:45.170
You think you do?

02:47:45.170 --> 02:47:48.320
Okay. I'll talk to you later.

02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:49.620
You have one too?

02:47:49.620 --> 02:47:50.920
Oh perfect.

02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:56.650
And here are, here are
a couple more images.

02:47:56.650 --> 02:47:59.310
As I said, that my project
as a whole is really trying

02:47:59.310 --> 02:48:02.810
to highlight DC as a city and
the native Washingtonians were,

02:48:02.810 --> 02:48:04.400
who were here at that time.

02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:08.700
So on the left, is the
cover of the 1968 yearbook

02:48:08.700 --> 02:48:10.440
from McKinley High School.

02:48:10.440 --> 02:48:15.410
Carmen Gilmore was a graduate of
McKinley High School from 1966.

02:48:15.410 --> 02:48:18.560
And I think yearbooks are
important because they are,

02:48:18.560 --> 02:48:21.460
they're actually, they're
product of, of student work.

02:48:21.460 --> 02:48:22.760
They're a piece of,
of [inaudible]

02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:25.420
and even inside the photographs
that the students decide

02:48:25.420 --> 02:48:28.230
to take what they
decide to focus on,

02:48:28.230 --> 02:48:30.980
really gives you insight
into what was happening

02:48:30.980 --> 02:48:33.070
at that year, in that year.

02:48:33.070 --> 02:48:35.890
And also what's important about
McKinley High School as well is

02:48:35.890 --> 02:48:40.240
that they had a chapter of
the Black Student Union,

02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:43.730
the DC Public School System
actually had a Black Student

02:48:43.730 --> 02:48:48.440
Union at a time when the public
school system was 90% black.

02:48:48.440 --> 02:48:50.030
Which I think is telling.

02:48:50.030 --> 02:48:51.800
You know that this was
a moment, you know,

02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:54.870
in black power civil rights and
a whole range of things going on

02:48:54.870 --> 02:48:58.610
and that even in a, in a
school, I mean in a city

02:48:58.610 --> 02:49:00.480
where the Mayor Commissioner
was black,

02:49:00.480 --> 02:49:04.430
many of the teachers were black,
and the students still felt

02:49:04.430 --> 02:49:06.580
that their -- it
wasn't black enough.

02:49:06.580 --> 02:49:08.010
I mean that they're
needed, in the sense

02:49:08.010 --> 02:49:10.940
that it wasn't black focused,
it wasn't black centered,

02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:13.400
they weren't learning
necessarily black history and,

02:49:13.400 --> 02:49:15.820
and African history and
culture, African languages.

02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:18.060
And so this is what
they were pushing for.

02:49:18.060 --> 02:49:21.150
At the same time, the students

02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:23.970
at McKinley Tech also
started a freedom school

02:49:23.970 --> 02:49:27.550
at the nearby Langley
Junior High School.

02:49:27.550 --> 02:49:31.390
Okay and then the second
one is the Bell Vocats,

02:49:31.390 --> 02:49:33.560
Bell Vocational High
School yearbook

02:49:33.560 --> 02:49:36.660
and unfortunately I don't
know that much about Bell

02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:38.310
but it was one of the technical,

02:49:38.310 --> 02:49:40.920
another technical high
school in, in the city.

02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:43.800
And then the final
two images are images

02:49:43.800 --> 02:49:46.840
that took place both
inside and outside

02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:51.100
of the Justice Building
in, in early June.

02:49:51.100 --> 02:49:53.900
And I'm not sure if you can see
but the, someone wrote graffiti

02:49:53.900 --> 02:49:57.910
on the Justice Building
that says, No Justice Here.

02:50:00.070 --> 02:50:04.060
And so I'm going to leave
you with an upcoming story

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.460
that I'll be doing about
Solidarity Day, and I,

02:50:06.460 --> 02:50:09.410
I love this theme that we've
been having about Solidarity Day

02:50:09.410 --> 02:50:12.580
because this fits in perfectly
that I'll be featuring

02:50:12.580 --> 02:50:15.370
on my site on the 19th of June.

02:50:15.370 --> 02:50:19.000
It is a story inspired by the
Boston Family, which is a,

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.830
a local family of
native Washingtonians.

02:50:21.830 --> 02:50:24.310
Ms. Boston, the mother,
is in the back

02:50:24.310 --> 02:50:25.610
with the green dress on.

02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:29.490
And then next to her
is her oldest daughter,

02:50:29.490 --> 02:50:31.300
Taquiena Boston.

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:34.160
And up in the front with
the beautiful hair bowties

02:50:34.160 --> 02:50:37.170
and the flower dress
is Mashawn Boston,

02:50:37.170 --> 02:50:38.970
who actually wrote
a wonderful article

02:50:38.970 --> 02:50:42.970
for the Washington City
paper about DC in 1968,

02:50:42.970 --> 02:50:47.490
and this is her at
a birthday party.

02:50:47.490 --> 02:50:51.920
And Taquiena, the 14 year
old, wrote in her red diary,

02:50:51.920 --> 02:50:54.490
a Christmas present
from her mother,

02:50:54.490 --> 02:50:58.660
she wrote in this diary
every single day in 1968.

02:50:58.660 --> 02:51:02.420
And she generously agreed to
share several of her daily,

02:51:02.420 --> 02:51:05.190
her diary entries with
the project, with me.

02:51:05.190 --> 02:51:09.050
In fact the very first
story and photograph

02:51:09.050 --> 02:51:12.110
for my project features
Taquiena reading

02:51:12.110 --> 02:51:15.670
from her very first diary
entry on New Year's Day.

02:51:15.670 --> 02:51:18.340
And so what I'm going to share
with you is a very short clip

02:51:18.340 --> 02:51:21.090
of a recording of her
reading from her diary entry

02:51:21.090 --> 02:51:25.260
on 19 June on Solidarity Day.

02:51:25.260 --> 02:51:28.410
&gt;&gt; Taquiena Boston:
June 19, 1968.

02:51:28.410 --> 02:51:31.310
Today my sister and
I bought ice cream.

02:51:31.310 --> 02:51:35.310
I didn't go out today, I
watched the Solidarity march

02:51:35.310 --> 02:51:40.400
on television, 75,000 people
were gathered, as the beginning

02:51:40.400 --> 02:51:43.130
of the war on poverty.

02:51:43.130 --> 02:51:47.210
Mrs. King's saying politicians,
union men, made speeches,

02:51:47.210 --> 02:51:50.530
and there was entertainment.

02:51:50.530 --> 02:51:54.400
I wish I'd gone but my
mother wouldn't let me.

02:51:54.400 --> 02:51:56.750
I jumped rope with my sister.

02:51:56.750 --> 02:51:59.650
Liz Taylor paid for
an ad for gun control,

02:51:59.650 --> 02:52:03.760
and 4,000 celebrities
signed a petition.

02:52:03.760 --> 02:52:06.210
In the ad, Bobby
Kennedy is walking

02:52:06.210 --> 02:52:09.260
in the fields with his dog.

02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:13.630
I'm reading more of the Bible,
and Profiles in Courage.

02:52:13.630 --> 02:52:18.210
I marked up Travels
with Charlie.

02:52:18.210 --> 02:52:19.510
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter: Thank you.

02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:21.310
&gt;&gt; Taquiena Boston: June 19 --

02:52:21.310 --> 02:52:25.120
[ Applause ]

02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:26.420
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter: She was 14.

02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:27.720
Yeah.

02:52:27.720 --> 02:52:29.040
[ Applause ]

02:52:29.040 --> 02:52:30.590
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: Thank you
all and it's wonderful to be

02:52:30.590 --> 02:52:31.890
on this panel with you.

02:52:31.890 --> 02:52:33.740
And again, my name
is Charon Hribar.

02:52:33.740 --> 02:52:37.630
And I am, work at the Kairos
Center for Religion Rights

02:52:37.630 --> 02:52:39.300
and Social Justice
which is housed

02:52:39.300 --> 02:52:42.820
at the Union Theological
Seminary in New York City.

02:52:42.820 --> 02:52:46.600
And, and kind of
the cornerstone of,

02:52:46.600 --> 02:52:49.610
of our work has been the Poverty
Initiative, which was kind

02:52:49.610 --> 02:52:51.390
of the precursor of
the Kairos Center.

02:52:51.390 --> 02:52:55.070
And when asked to be part
of this discussion today,

02:52:55.070 --> 02:53:00.260
of why the Poor People's
Campaign, both of 1968 and now,

02:53:00.260 --> 02:53:04.430
is important to me, it's, it's
hard to narrow that answer,

02:53:04.430 --> 02:53:07.150
for me, because it's something
that I've been really working

02:53:07.150 --> 02:53:09.370
on for the last 15
years of my life.

02:53:09.370 --> 02:53:12.810
That's a lot shorter for some
of that have, were at '68.

02:53:12.810 --> 02:53:17.130
But you know, I think that
this is a very important moment

02:53:17.130 --> 02:53:20.210
in our country to remember
that moment as well

02:53:20.210 --> 02:53:22.680
as what is happening now.

02:53:22.680 --> 02:53:24.820
And you know, I think
over the years,

02:53:24.820 --> 02:53:29.480
the Poverty Initiative we had
-- we've had a mission that was

02:53:29.480 --> 02:53:34.410
to unite, to develop and unite
religious and community leaders

02:53:34.410 --> 02:53:38.900
to build a broad social movement
to end poverty led by the poor.

02:53:38.900 --> 02:53:43.470
And with that mission, the role
of the Poor People's Campaign

02:53:43.470 --> 02:53:47.280
and the history of, of that
'68 campaign has been a history

02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:50.680
that we've, in detail
studied over the years.

02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:53.950
And, and really have been a
continuation of that work.

02:53:53.950 --> 02:53:59.700
As I came into, into the
organization, in 2004,

02:53:59.700 --> 02:54:02.850
I was met by a movement
that had formed

02:54:02.850 --> 02:54:05.280
out of the Welfare Rights
work that had formed

02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:07.900
out of homeless organizing
in this country.

02:54:07.900 --> 02:54:11.070
And that had, you know, that
was still not, you know,

02:54:11.070 --> 02:54:14.470
haven't lost that spirit
of the 1968 campaign, and,

02:54:14.470 --> 02:54:17.950
and was one of those
continuing aspects.

02:54:17.950 --> 02:54:21.060
And you know, over the, it's
interesting in this moment

02:54:21.060 --> 02:54:23.960
as we've been working
to build this campaign

02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:28.760
over these last 15 years, and 20
years, and 40 years, you know,

02:54:28.760 --> 02:54:30.910
that this has been
a continuation.

02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:32.700
And you know, going
around the country

02:54:32.700 --> 02:54:34.100
and asking people
have their heard

02:54:34.100 --> 02:54:35.790
of the Poor People's
Campaign before,

02:54:35.790 --> 02:54:37.950
and how many people
had not, right.

02:54:37.950 --> 02:54:40.020
We've, we've learned
the, like lessons

02:54:40.020 --> 02:54:43.130
from the Civil Rights
Movement and from Dr. King.

02:54:43.130 --> 02:54:46.250
But those last years
especially and, and his role,

02:54:46.250 --> 02:54:49.400
and in bringing folks
together across racial lines,

02:54:49.400 --> 02:54:52.650
and being able to make
these deep connections

02:54:52.650 --> 02:54:57.010
between the role of racism,
seismic racism and poverty

02:54:57.010 --> 02:54:59.970
and militarism at that
moment, had been, you know,

02:54:59.970 --> 02:55:01.820
largely not discussed.

02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:08.080
And as, you know, as we were
talking about that among folks

02:55:08.080 --> 02:55:10.670
that are in poor
communities, and recognizing as,

02:55:10.670 --> 02:55:14.150
as folks have said, that more
and more of us are falling

02:55:14.150 --> 02:55:15.940
into poverty, you know and,

02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:17.850
and that's the reality
that we're in.

02:55:17.850 --> 02:55:21.430
And it's how essential it is
to understand our history.

02:55:21.430 --> 02:55:24.370
And to know what we
can learn from that.

02:55:24.370 --> 02:55:27.660
And, and that we know
that time and time again,

02:55:27.660 --> 02:55:32.020
movements that have been trying
to bring people together,

02:55:32.020 --> 02:55:36.140
across racial geography,
religious lines, you know,

02:55:36.140 --> 02:55:39.190
have tried to be
suppressed in this country,

02:55:39.190 --> 02:55:40.490
and, and around the world.

02:55:40.490 --> 02:55:45.290
And so you know to have this
opportunity to think about why

02:55:45.290 --> 02:55:48.070
that movement was so important
and why we're taking it

02:55:48.070 --> 02:55:52.110
up again today, you know, is,
I'm, I'm glad to be able to do

02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:54.500
that in this space, because
I think it's something

02:55:54.500 --> 02:55:56.940
that we need to both
be doing in the streets

02:55:56.940 --> 02:55:58.240
and in our communities.

02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:00.580
But also in the major
institutions of our country,

02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:03.230
because that's, you
know, across the board,

02:56:03.230 --> 02:56:04.890
we need to be having
these conversations.

02:56:04.890 --> 02:56:08.150
So I just appreciate
being able to be here.

02:56:08.150 --> 02:56:12.800
And so, yeah I, I really
wanted to just you know,

02:56:12.800 --> 02:56:15.560
be able to talk about the
relationship that we've had

02:56:15.560 --> 02:56:18.270
with this history and what
we're trying to do now, and,

02:56:18.270 --> 02:56:20.450
and building a poor people's
campaign and a national call

02:56:20.450 --> 02:56:22.630
for more revival today.

02:56:22.630 --> 02:56:26.060
And you know, one of the
things I think was mentioned

02:56:26.060 --> 02:56:29.690
in this morning's panel,
you know and something

02:56:29.690 --> 02:56:32.170
that we've really
learned from the history

02:56:32.170 --> 02:56:34.420
of the campaign you know
it wasn't just about coming

02:56:34.420 --> 02:56:37.360
to Washington, right, it
was, you know, about the,

02:56:37.360 --> 02:56:39.250
the next step of
that work continuing

02:56:39.250 --> 02:56:44.090
to build the organizing work
out there, around the country.

02:56:44.090 --> 02:56:48.690
And I think Dr. King reflecting
in his, where do we go

02:56:48.690 --> 02:56:54.600
from here speech, had
talked about, you know,

02:56:54.600 --> 02:56:56.570
reflecting on what the successes

02:56:56.570 --> 02:57:00.220
of the Civil Rights Movement
have been up, up to that point.

02:57:00.220 --> 02:57:03.350
And really seeing how, you
know, some of the efforts

02:57:03.350 --> 02:57:07.310
to organize have been able to,
to take advantage of, you know,

02:57:07.310 --> 02:57:10.800
key moments and to dramatize the
conditions that were happening,

02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:12.960
and the contradictions
that were happening.

02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.550
But he also said what was the
next step needed was to be able

02:57:16.550 --> 02:57:22.310
to build a, a systemic organized
structure across the country

02:57:22.310 --> 02:57:25.590
that could hold that continued
organizing, and continue

02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:27.490
to connect the work
that was going on.

02:57:27.490 --> 02:57:30.430
And I think that's what, you
know, we're picking that up now.

02:57:30.430 --> 02:57:34.090
And, and seeing, you know, that
in this Poor People's Campaign,

02:57:34.090 --> 02:57:35.840
the National Call
for more Revival,

02:57:35.840 --> 02:57:39.570
the video that you all got to
see this morning, we just a few

02:57:39.570 --> 02:57:43.970
of the powerful voices and a
few of the stories that are

02:57:43.970 --> 02:57:47.150
out there of people in this
struggle organizing right now.

02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:49.410
And how do we take this
moment to really start

02:57:49.410 --> 02:57:53.400
to bring those efforts together
is something that we are trying

02:57:53.400 --> 02:57:57.420
to do, and that we know there
is a need for right now.

02:57:57.420 --> 02:58:00.950
We're, we're thinking of how
are we building a movement

02:58:00.950 --> 02:58:03.530
of movements, and not
just a moment, right.

02:58:03.530 --> 02:58:06.170
We talked this morning, you
know, that it's not just,

02:58:06.170 --> 02:58:07.870
you know, it's not a failure of,

02:58:07.870 --> 02:58:10.510
of you don't accomplish
something and then we've lost,

02:58:10.510 --> 02:58:11.930
you know the, the goal.

02:58:11.930 --> 02:58:14.570
But that there is this
continuation that is happening,

02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:16.170
and we are right now in a moment

02:58:16.170 --> 02:58:19.320
where something really powerful
is this coming together.

02:58:19.320 --> 02:58:21.920
And we see movements wanting
to build on one another.

02:58:21.920 --> 02:58:27.560
And so I, you know, I say this
and, and want to again lift

02:58:27.560 --> 02:58:32.360
up this idea that I think Guha
you mentioned earlier too,

02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:36.640
you know that there are
140 million poor folks

02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:39.120
in this country, and those
numbers as Marc you said,

02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:42.370
are just, you know, the
tip of the iceberg, right.

02:58:42.370 --> 02:58:46.070
There are so many more that
are actually not recognized

02:58:46.070 --> 02:58:48.170
by the current ways
that we are able

02:58:48.170 --> 02:58:51.090
to define poverty right
now in this country.

02:58:51.090 --> 02:58:54.100
And that, you know, and that,
you know, one in, that means one

02:58:54.100 --> 02:58:55.580
in two Americans right now,

02:58:55.580 --> 02:58:59.090
even by those standards are
experiencing these conditions.

02:58:59.090 --> 02:59:01.580
And we know how much
those are connected

02:59:01.580 --> 02:59:05.030
to what we're lifting up,
as King did, the connections

02:59:05.030 --> 02:59:07.210
of racism, militarism
and poverty.

02:59:07.210 --> 02:59:10.650
And also, what we've continued
to recognize is the role

02:59:10.650 --> 02:59:12.370
in so many of the
communities out there

02:59:12.370 --> 02:59:14.740
of ethological devastation
and how much impact

02:59:14.740 --> 02:59:16.530
that is having on people.

02:59:16.530 --> 02:59:20.460
But, you know the, I think
the one thing, you know that,

02:59:20.460 --> 02:59:23.010
think about that monument,
the image of that staring

02:59:23.010 --> 02:59:26.990
down at us, is also this piece
of it's not an issue of scarcity

02:59:26.990 --> 02:59:29.370
in the, scarcity for
the sake of scarcity

02:59:29.370 --> 02:59:30.880
that we don't have enough.

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:33.020
But what this is
recognizing, and what, you know,

02:59:33.020 --> 02:59:36.080
King was recognizing then,
is that it's scarcity

02:59:36.080 --> 02:59:37.500
in the midst of abundance.

02:59:37.500 --> 02:59:42.060
We have the ability
to end poverty.

02:59:42.060 --> 02:59:44.430
King said, do we have the
will to do that, right.

02:59:44.430 --> 02:59:47.450
And that's really what we're
suggesting is that, you know,

02:59:47.450 --> 02:59:50.380
that we have the ability
to actually end poverty

02:59:50.380 --> 02:59:52.080
and to end seismic racism

02:59:52.080 --> 02:59:56.700
and to reexamine how we are
using our military budget and,

02:59:56.700 --> 03:00:01.090
and all of these things for
what we need is the role of,

03:00:01.090 --> 03:00:02.600
and the rights, and the dignity

03:00:02.600 --> 03:00:05.300
of people all across
this country.

03:00:05.300 --> 03:00:08.990
And so really what, you know,
in this current campaign,

03:00:08.990 --> 03:00:12.410
how do we start to shift
people's understanding of that,

03:00:12.410 --> 03:00:13.880
to shift the narrative.

03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:16.810
And, and one of the expressions
we've used over the years

03:00:16.810 --> 03:00:19.560
in our work is that movements
begin with the telling

03:00:19.560 --> 03:00:23.290
of untold stories, and
how powerful, you know,

03:00:23.290 --> 03:00:24.720
seeing that video this morning,

03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:26.820
of hearing those
stories that were told.

03:00:26.820 --> 03:00:28.840
And it's not just
about the story,

03:00:28.840 --> 03:00:31.870
but it's also someone else
that like sitting and listening

03:00:31.870 --> 03:00:36.600
to that story, recognizes I'm
experiencing that too, right.

03:00:36.600 --> 03:00:39.490
And that this isn't just
about me coming as an ally,

03:00:39.490 --> 03:00:42.290
it's not just about me
supporting this movement,

03:00:42.290 --> 03:00:44.880
but that we all have a role
and that we are impacted

03:00:44.880 --> 03:00:47.010
in some way by these things.

03:00:47.010 --> 03:00:51.190
And so kind of segueing
into the, one of the roles

03:00:51.190 --> 03:00:54.000
that I'm playing currently in
the campaign and, and the work

03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:55.810
that we're trying
to do in thinking

03:00:55.810 --> 03:00:58.650
about how culture
also holds this.

03:00:58.650 --> 03:01:01.330
How are we telling these
stories, and the importance

03:01:01.330 --> 03:01:04.860
of the, the other panelists
and talking about, you know,

03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:08.640
the role of documentation,
the role of the images,

03:01:08.640 --> 03:01:11.170
the role of how we even
shape these stories,

03:01:11.170 --> 03:01:16.060
is something I just wanted
to share a little bit

03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:19.000
about what we've tried to
do with the current campaign

03:01:19.000 --> 03:01:22.580
and the context of,
of this movement.

03:01:22.580 --> 03:01:29.930
And so, just a few clips here.

03:01:29.930 --> 03:01:34.460
Images to share, and, and then
actually the first video is also

03:01:34.460 --> 03:01:37.250
kind of a continuation of,
of how do we, you know,

03:01:37.250 --> 03:01:40.310
continue to document these
stories and share them out.

03:01:40.310 --> 03:01:45.310
But in February kind of leading
up to this current 40 days.

03:01:45.310 --> 03:01:49.380
Sorry I'm actually going to
back track for one second.

03:01:49.380 --> 03:01:53.310
So just to say that kind of
before coming to right now, as,

03:01:53.310 --> 03:01:56.390
as folks may know that we're
in this 40 days of action.

03:01:56.390 --> 03:01:58.070
You know, and I've said

03:01:58.070 --> 03:02:02.250
that this has been a
continuation of years of work.

03:02:02.250 --> 03:02:04.200
But even within that
continuation

03:02:04.200 --> 03:02:08.300
over the last two years has
really been an effort, you know,

03:02:08.300 --> 03:02:12.530
do a series of tours, a series
of training, a series of,

03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:14.170
you know, getting people ready

03:02:14.170 --> 03:02:16.920
to be taking part
in these 40 days.

03:02:16.920 --> 03:02:21.540
And so starting last August we
had actually launched a series

03:02:21.540 --> 03:02:25.590
of organizing trainings to start
to actually build, how do we,

03:02:25.590 --> 03:02:27.770
how are we going to
continue to sustain this,

03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:31.230
to bring organizations together,
to bring religious leaders

03:02:31.230 --> 03:02:34.040
with impacted people,
with students,

03:02:34.040 --> 03:02:37.320
with all of these groups so that
we could actually come together

03:02:37.320 --> 03:02:38.810
and build this movement.

03:02:38.810 --> 03:02:43.590
And so we had gone to 15 cities
from August through November.

03:02:43.590 --> 03:02:47.790
And not just major cities
but also small cities,

03:02:47.790 --> 03:02:50.150
bringing together rural
and urban, you know,

03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:52.560
thinking about the
role of states in this,

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:54.730
that it's not just,
you know, not just DC

03:02:54.730 --> 03:02:57.980
but also how do you think
of not just being in Chicago

03:02:57.980 --> 03:03:00.760
or in New York City, but also
that we're going to be going

03:03:00.760 --> 03:03:02.910
to our state capitals
and needing to reach

03:03:02.910 --> 03:03:06.160
across the, the geography scope.

03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:09.890
And so in that process, you
know, really having, great,

03:03:09.890 --> 03:03:13.700
really having a chance to
start to sit and listen

03:03:13.700 --> 03:03:18.160
to what was happening all across
this country, to hear people's,

03:03:18.160 --> 03:03:22.520
the impact that, of what
these conditions are having.

03:03:22.520 --> 03:03:25.300
And so as a continuation
for the cultural role,

03:03:25.300 --> 03:03:28.870
in February we had actually
convened as people had come

03:03:28.870 --> 03:03:31.150
in through that process,

03:03:31.150 --> 03:03:34.880
now over 40 states are
involved in this campaign.

03:03:34.880 --> 03:03:38.290
And, and in February in
Raleigh, North Carolina,

03:03:38.290 --> 03:03:41.540
we convened artists, cultural
workers, cultural organizers,

03:03:41.540 --> 03:03:45.810
documentarians, to start to
seed, you know, the, the --

03:03:45.810 --> 03:03:47.240
how we were going to be able

03:03:47.240 --> 03:03:49.240
to communicate what
was actually happening.

03:03:49.240 --> 03:03:51.460
That it wasn't just one spot,

03:03:51.460 --> 03:03:53.480
that this movement was
happening, but it was all

03:03:53.480 --> 03:03:54.780
over the country, that there are

03:03:54.780 --> 03:03:56.920
so many leaders that
are raising up.

03:03:56.920 --> 03:04:02.200
And so we had musicians,
we had documentarians,

03:04:02.200 --> 03:04:04.470
photographers, and
videographers.

03:04:04.470 --> 03:04:07.680
We had visual artists that
came together from each

03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:11.340
of those states to be
able to start to think

03:04:11.340 --> 03:04:14.660
about during this 40 days, how
would we carry out the message?

03:04:14.660 --> 03:04:17.060
How would we help
amplify our voices?

03:04:17.060 --> 03:04:20.110
And as artists knowing that
we weren't just, again,

03:04:20.110 --> 03:04:22.700
supporters of this movement, but
that we were telling our stories

03:04:22.700 --> 03:04:25.240
and that these things
were impacting us too.

03:04:25.240 --> 03:04:27.770
And so, you know, these are
just a few of the images of,

03:04:27.770 --> 03:04:32.290
of that convening of, of
the broad group of ages, of,

03:04:32.290 --> 03:04:35.940
of different cultures,
of different places,

03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:38.890
you know of people coming
together from across the country

03:04:38.890 --> 03:04:41.700
that were starting to, you know,
as we talked about what happened

03:04:41.700 --> 03:04:45.870
in that Soul Tent in 1968
to share some of our stories

03:04:45.870 --> 03:04:48.740
and cultures to be
able to be what is,

03:04:48.740 --> 03:04:50.890
is uniting us in this movement.

03:04:50.890 --> 03:04:54.760
And so we did several things of,
of being able to create songs

03:04:54.760 --> 03:04:57.730
for this movement as, as
Maggie had mentioned earlier

03:04:57.730 --> 03:05:00.250
that we've taken one of the
old songs, and Yara will talk

03:05:00.250 --> 03:05:03.350
about this shortly, of
everybody's got a right to live

03:05:03.350 --> 03:05:05.100
and making that relevant
for today,

03:05:05.100 --> 03:05:08.090
but also you know
continuing to learn some

03:05:08.090 --> 03:05:10.030
of the old movement
songs as well

03:05:10.030 --> 03:05:14.040
as create new songs
for this moment.

03:05:14.040 --> 03:05:15.840
You know able to create
some of the, you know,

03:05:15.840 --> 03:05:19.210
the visual messages of that
can really resonate with people

03:05:19.210 --> 03:05:21.640
and how that, are we able to,

03:05:21.640 --> 03:05:24.770
as we start to build
across the country.

03:05:24.770 --> 03:05:27.690
When you're out there organizing
and then being able to reflect,

03:05:27.690 --> 03:05:30.120
especially with having
social media today.

03:05:30.120 --> 03:05:33.410
You start to identify right
what is the visual identity

03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:35.510
of a movement and what are
the messages that speak

03:05:35.510 --> 03:05:40.740
to our hearts and move peoples'
minds in this, in this society.

03:05:40.740 --> 03:05:42.990
And then again with
the documentarians,

03:05:42.990 --> 03:05:45.700
how is not just the one
image that the, that,

03:05:45.700 --> 03:05:47.630
that major media is
going to show you,

03:05:47.630 --> 03:05:50.460
but knowing that these
actions, these activities,

03:05:50.460 --> 03:05:51.900
the organizing that's
happening all

03:05:51.900 --> 03:05:54.970
over the country is actually
documented so that we know

03:05:54.970 --> 03:05:58.240
that the multiplicity of
stories that are out there.

03:05:58.240 --> 03:06:00.310
And then, and then just even
looking at these images,

03:06:00.310 --> 03:06:03.010
these are some of the images
that have emerged as part

03:06:03.010 --> 03:06:04.920
of this movement
to see you know,

03:06:04.920 --> 03:06:08.740
even in Brandon's face here,
like that, that urgency

03:06:08.740 --> 03:06:11.790
and passion that is in that,
like that we know the role

03:06:11.790 --> 03:06:14.950
of culture not only today
in bringing us together

03:06:14.950 --> 03:06:19.450
and grounding us right now,
but in 50 years from now,

03:06:19.450 --> 03:06:22.370
what people will remember
and see that we see

03:06:22.370 --> 03:06:23.780
that through these
living images.

03:06:23.780 --> 03:06:31.350
And so, right here, and
you know, and in being able

03:06:31.350 --> 03:06:35.820
to great, even we, we actually
made music videos for folks

03:06:35.820 --> 03:06:39.270
to be able to learn the songs of
the movement around the country.

03:06:39.270 --> 03:06:40.570
I think, you know, it's one of,

03:06:40.570 --> 03:06:42.210
Yara will talk more
about the music.

03:06:42.210 --> 03:06:44.600
But I think it's one of
pieces that, in some ways,

03:06:44.600 --> 03:06:49.040
we've lost over the years of you
know, how do we sing together,

03:06:49.040 --> 03:06:52.450
how do we actually hold each
other in community in that way,

03:06:52.450 --> 03:06:57.440
and to be able to lift, you
know, lift our voices in a,

03:06:57.440 --> 03:07:01.380
in one voice, one band,
one song as we say.

03:07:01.380 --> 03:07:04.170
And again, just how are
we getting our messages

03:07:04.170 --> 03:07:07.790
out when we know that mass
media is not going to continue

03:07:07.790 --> 03:07:11.900
to put our, what we're
trying to do out there.

03:07:11.900 --> 03:07:14.510
So I'm wrapping up here and
going to turn it over to Yara

03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:17.660
to keep going with how we're
working through the culture.

03:07:17.660 --> 03:07:20.840
But you can kind of see how
these, these pieces have started

03:07:20.840 --> 03:07:25.360
to emerge in different actions
across the country and having a,

03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:28.550
you know, a very living
movement and being able

03:07:28.550 --> 03:07:30.800
to express the stories of,

03:07:30.800 --> 03:07:34.170
of those most impacted
in, in this work.

03:07:34.170 --> 03:07:35.610
And to call others
to be part of it.

03:07:35.610 --> 03:07:37.510
So I'll stop there for now.

03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:44.040
[ Applause ]

03:07:44.040 --> 03:07:46.510
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: Thank you all,
good evening, or good afternoon.

03:07:46.510 --> 03:07:52.010
And I am very honored as
well just to be in this place

03:07:52.010 --> 03:07:55.880
with so many wonderful
people, everybody included.

03:07:55.880 --> 03:08:04.110
I would have to say that when
I think about the 1968 Campaign

03:08:04.110 --> 03:08:09.950
and how it moved me to do what
I'm doing, I have to go back

03:08:09.950 --> 03:08:16.220
to a snapshot of the day that I
heard the announcement on the TV

03:08:16.220 --> 03:08:19.200
that Dr. King was killed.

03:08:19.200 --> 03:08:22.040
And the reaction
that my mother had,

03:08:22.040 --> 03:08:25.500
as she was ironing my
father's white shirt.

03:08:25.500 --> 03:08:29.170
She dropped the iron
and screamed.

03:08:29.170 --> 03:08:34.170
And I just remember staring at
the TV and looking back at her.

03:08:34.170 --> 03:08:37.430
She ran out into the street
and the neighbor met her

03:08:37.430 --> 03:08:38.890
from across the street.

03:08:38.890 --> 03:08:40.190
Did you hear?

03:08:40.190 --> 03:08:41.490
Did you hear?

03:08:41.490 --> 03:08:43.230
And I remember climbing
up on the bed and looking

03:08:43.230 --> 03:08:47.030
out the window as these
women wept in the street.

03:08:47.030 --> 03:08:50.060
And my father coming home

03:08:50.060 --> 03:08:53.970
and just being the strong
silent World War II Veteran

03:08:53.970 --> 03:08:57.370
who really didn't show
a whole lot of emotions.

03:08:57.370 --> 03:09:01.110
He broke. You know, he broke.

03:09:01.110 --> 03:09:05.580
And this history wasn't really
taught to us in schools.

03:09:05.580 --> 03:09:10.300
We didn't hear much about
the Poor People's Campaign.

03:09:10.300 --> 03:09:11.960
That was conveniently just kind

03:09:11.960 --> 03:09:15.460
of smoothed over,
it was glided over.

03:09:15.460 --> 03:09:19.630
But thankfully we had parents
who made sure that we read,

03:09:19.630 --> 03:09:22.500
and they taught us this history.

03:09:22.500 --> 03:09:24.680
And in teaching us this
history, the one thing

03:09:24.680 --> 03:09:28.980
that they made sure we
did was that we sang.

03:09:28.980 --> 03:09:31.910
And they were planting
something in us then

03:09:31.910 --> 03:09:34.080
that would manifest now.

03:09:34.080 --> 03:09:41.000
So imagine if you would, a young
child playing with her friends,

03:09:41.000 --> 03:09:45.200
and they're singing Rock
'n Robin by the Jackson 5.

03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:49.360
And we're going around
taking turns singing songs.

03:09:49.360 --> 03:09:50.730
And it's my turn.

03:09:50.730 --> 03:09:53.630
And I think all the good
songs have been taken.

03:09:53.630 --> 03:09:55.250
I know one.

03:09:55.250 --> 03:10:02.460
And as a kid I belt
out Soon we'll be done.

03:10:02.460 --> 03:10:06.620
With the troubles of the world.

03:10:06.620 --> 03:10:09.130
The kids going what?

03:10:09.130 --> 03:10:13.320
Now this, that's
not the good part.

03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:20.130
Then I get to the part, I'm
going home to live with God.

03:10:20.130 --> 03:10:23.190
And they're going, and
that was the expression

03:10:23.190 --> 03:10:25.090
like that right there.

03:10:25.090 --> 03:10:28.110
But those were the songs
that we were taught to sing,

03:10:28.110 --> 03:10:30.860
and they were teaching us a
history while they were teaching

03:10:30.860 --> 03:10:32.160
those songs.

03:10:32.160 --> 03:10:35.350
And now I realize that they were
trying to preserve those songs,

03:10:35.350 --> 03:10:40.210
just like our ancestors have
preserved the songs before them.

03:10:40.210 --> 03:10:44.510
So I started singing
with my sister,

03:10:44.510 --> 03:10:47.500
I was five, she was eight.

03:10:47.500 --> 03:10:50.430
And I ended up singing
in the church.

03:10:50.430 --> 03:10:54.710
But what I heard in the messages
of Dr. King and what my mother

03:10:54.710 --> 03:10:57.290
and father taught me
didn't really align

03:10:57.290 --> 03:10:59.940
with what I was hearing in
the church at that time.

03:10:59.940 --> 03:11:02.600
It didn't have that
radical edge to it.

03:11:02.600 --> 03:11:05.840
So I became the radical
of the church.

03:11:05.840 --> 03:11:08.810
That didn't last too long.

03:11:08.810 --> 03:11:14.480
And so I, I moved
from the church

03:11:14.480 --> 03:11:16.660
to actually doing
community organizing

03:11:16.660 --> 03:11:18.780
and that felt a little
more comfortable for me.

03:11:18.780 --> 03:11:20.980
I was like yeah I can be
a little bit more radical.

03:11:20.980 --> 03:11:24.880
I, I would be the one who
would lead a group of students

03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:29.260
out of the cafeteria because we
had corn instead of green beans.

03:11:30.880 --> 03:11:33.180
Let's do this.

03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:37.390
So eventually, I'll
fast forward.

03:11:37.390 --> 03:11:40.080
I began working with
Repairers of the Breach.

03:11:40.080 --> 03:11:42.900
After working with
several organizers and,

03:11:42.900 --> 03:11:44.720
organizations I'm sorry.

03:11:44.720 --> 03:11:47.790
And I, I began working with
Repairers of the Breach.

03:11:47.790 --> 03:11:54.190
And in 2015-16 we did what was
called the Moral Revival Tour.

03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:59.440
And we went to 27 states
and pretty much teaching

03:11:59.440 --> 03:12:01.840
through the component and poll.

03:12:01.840 --> 03:12:06.860
It's more political organizing
leadership institute summit,

03:12:06.860 --> 03:12:10.650
which is the component that
lends support and tools

03:12:10.650 --> 03:12:16.110
to moral organizers and,
and this support helps them

03:12:16.110 --> 03:12:22.190
to do moral analysis,
moral articulation

03:12:22.190 --> 03:12:23.880
and then moral activism.

03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:30.170
We're going to take a drop
box, and from that we'll drop

03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:32.050
down to the cultural arts.

03:12:32.050 --> 03:12:35.410
And we used those
same strategies

03:12:35.410 --> 03:12:38.020
to engage artists
across the country.

03:12:38.020 --> 03:12:41.850
And we talked about
moral articulation

03:12:41.850 --> 03:12:43.460
where it involved music.

03:12:43.460 --> 03:12:48.510
We talked about how, how
do we implement this music?

03:12:48.510 --> 03:12:51.650
You know how do we
analyze the music?

03:12:51.650 --> 03:12:56.980
So using that strategy and
the Theo Musicology Strategy

03:12:56.980 --> 03:13:00.750
which is the study of
music informed by religion.

03:13:00.750 --> 03:13:03.910
And so when we talk
about the Theo part

03:13:03.910 --> 03:13:07.990
of the Musicology it is really
talking about what is the nature

03:13:07.990 --> 03:13:09.970
of the god of our understanding.

03:13:09.970 --> 03:13:11.610
What is the nature of goodness,

03:13:11.610 --> 03:13:13.790
if you don't have
a particular faith?

03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:17.140
What is the nature
of our better angels?

03:13:17.140 --> 03:13:21.900
And now let's take this music
and let's weigh them to see,

03:13:21.900 --> 03:13:24.850
how can we pull the
goodness from this music?

03:13:24.850 --> 03:13:27.270
How can we serve humanity?

03:13:27.270 --> 03:13:30.570
How can we lift each
other through this music?

03:13:30.570 --> 03:13:34.660
So eventually we
joined with Kairos

03:13:34.660 --> 03:13:37.980
and we found ourselves
on tour again.

03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:42.040
Going back to some of the same
states, but then adding a few.

03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:46.750
And using this same component
to engage even more artists.

03:13:46.750 --> 03:13:51.020
We were very intentional
about the fusion part of this.

03:13:51.020 --> 03:13:54.520
Very intentional about
including the youth.

03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:57.600
Because we wanted to make
sure that that generation gap

03:13:57.600 --> 03:14:00.990
that everybody talks
about was closed.

03:14:00.990 --> 03:14:04.560
And that we would not be
guilty of having that breach

03:14:04.560 --> 03:14:07.570
when the generation
comes along to fight.

03:14:07.570 --> 03:14:13.540
So Dr. T.V. Reed said in his
book, The Art of Protests

03:14:13.540 --> 03:14:17.670
that there is a way
to bridge those gaps,

03:14:17.670 --> 03:14:20.040
and he gave the example
of taking the music

03:14:20.040 --> 03:14:23.090
from the '50s and the '60s.

03:14:23.090 --> 03:14:25.810
And implementing this music
into our current movement.

03:14:25.810 --> 03:14:30.980
And what that does is it gives
people like my grandmother,

03:14:30.980 --> 03:14:33.610
my mother, a sense of assurance

03:14:33.610 --> 03:14:36.570
that they still have a
place in this movement.

03:14:36.570 --> 03:14:39.490
And then by turning the music
over to the young people who,

03:14:39.490 --> 03:14:42.630
as Charon said, put
a little spin to it.

03:14:42.630 --> 03:14:45.880
It gave them a place and
an opportunity to talk

03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:48.350
with the older people,
and to learn that history,

03:14:48.350 --> 03:14:51.060
and to respect where
those songs came from.

03:14:51.060 --> 03:14:56.330
So what we ended up with at this
retreat were artists who came

03:14:56.330 --> 03:15:01.890
with all these brilliant ideas,
all these wonderful sounds

03:15:01.890 --> 03:15:05.570
and wonderful beats and,
and wonderful tones,

03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:08.180
and we put them all together.

03:15:08.180 --> 03:15:10.060
Now what you're going
to see in this video,

03:15:10.060 --> 03:15:12.850
I didn't show you the piece
that's going to blow your mind,

03:15:12.850 --> 03:15:14.980
but I'm going to ask you
to go back and look at it.

03:15:14.980 --> 03:15:18.320
How many of you remember
the song, Fight the Power?

03:15:18.320 --> 03:15:20.510
So you are of a particular age.

03:15:20.510 --> 03:15:25.130
[ Laughter ]

03:15:25.130 --> 03:15:29.360
You are of a particular age, so
am I, if you remember that song.

03:15:29.360 --> 03:15:32.480
And so when we sing, let me back
up a minute because speaking

03:15:32.480 --> 03:15:35.790
of particular age, so
we know that that, and,

03:15:35.790 --> 03:15:38.030
and this is what we
teach across the nation.

03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:40.850
That we have to engage artists,

03:15:40.850 --> 03:15:44.430
because artists have
this wonderful ability

03:15:44.430 --> 03:15:49.280
to change the distorted moral
narrative that exists right now.

03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:50.910
Because people will
sometimes listen

03:15:50.910 --> 03:15:54.100
to music before they'll
listen to the message, right.

03:15:54.100 --> 03:15:55.400
The music will draw them.

03:15:55.400 --> 03:15:57.850
I'll give you an
example, Moral Mondays.

03:15:57.850 --> 03:16:01.820
I was walking onto the, the
grounds of Moral Mondays.

03:16:01.820 --> 03:16:05.120
And a lady came running
towards me.

03:16:05.120 --> 03:16:07.910
Yara, Yara, she fell
into my arms,

03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:09.950
literally fell into
my arms crying.

03:16:09.950 --> 03:16:12.150
I said what in the
world happened to her?

03:16:12.150 --> 03:16:14.880
And she's saying, you
all saved my life.

03:16:14.880 --> 03:16:17.020
I said okay.

03:16:17.020 --> 03:16:21.720
She says, no you really,
really literally saved my life.

03:16:21.720 --> 03:16:23.690
She said I'm a battered woman.

03:16:23.690 --> 03:16:27.390
I've been hiding my
bruises under my clothes.

03:16:27.390 --> 03:16:30.720
She said, I wrote
my suicide note,

03:16:30.720 --> 03:16:32.410
and I was ready to
call it a day.

03:16:32.410 --> 03:16:36.610
And I was walking three
or four streets over,

03:16:36.610 --> 03:16:39.260
and I heard the music.

03:16:39.260 --> 03:16:42.050
And I followed the music here.

03:16:42.050 --> 03:16:45.000
And she said, and you
all were singing hold

03:16:45.000 --> 03:16:46.340
on just a little while longer.

03:16:46.340 --> 03:16:49.390
I broke with her of course

03:16:49.390 --> 03:16:53.980
because I'm just a
bag of water anyway.

03:16:53.980 --> 03:16:58.050
But to hear the power that
that music had in that moment

03:16:58.050 --> 03:17:02.140
that saved her life, knowing
that she would live another day

03:17:02.140 --> 03:17:05.530
to fight, and that she would
help save somebody's life.

03:17:05.530 --> 03:17:09.330
So you see the power of
music, the power of the arts.

03:17:09.330 --> 03:17:14.170
We, we like to say that music
does what Dr. Wyatt T. Walker

03:17:14.170 --> 03:17:18.870
says, and it creates
collective effervescence.

03:17:18.870 --> 03:17:21.840
And Dr. T.V. Reed says
it creates a place

03:17:21.840 --> 03:17:24.090
for a collective identity.

03:17:24.090 --> 03:17:27.290
Now if you are of that
certain age you'll know

03:17:27.290 --> 03:17:30.340
that the collective
effervescence is the fizz fizz

03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:34.330
to the plop plop.

03:17:34.330 --> 03:17:39.400
So if you laughed, right.

03:17:39.400 --> 03:17:44.150
So, so the other thing the thing
that happened that was magical

03:17:44.150 --> 03:17:49.460
at this retreat was that we
got to engage in moral, in,

03:17:49.460 --> 03:17:51.140
in activism more activism.

03:17:51.140 --> 03:17:55.900
Because after this retreat we
went out to the H.K. on J.,

03:17:55.900 --> 03:17:59.850
the Moral March on Riley,
and we lifted our voices

03:17:59.850 --> 03:18:02.190
and we raised our banners

03:18:02.190 --> 03:18:04.450
and we pretty much
raised the roof that day.

03:18:04.450 --> 03:18:06.130
And to see all of these artists

03:18:06.130 --> 03:18:11.800
who had never sung together
ever come together and create

03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:15.560
that kind of energy that
moved so many people.

03:18:15.560 --> 03:18:19.740
Now in that song, fight
the power, there was,

03:18:19.740 --> 03:18:22.130
and those of you will know,
Charon's laughing, because those

03:18:22.130 --> 03:18:24.790
of you who know that song,
know that it's hip hop.

03:18:24.790 --> 03:18:29.970
What in the middle of that song
a young man from Kentucky broke

03:18:29.970 --> 03:18:32.770
out his banjo and did a solo.

03:18:32.770 --> 03:18:35.540
And it worked.

03:18:35.540 --> 03:18:36.840
It worked.

03:18:36.840 --> 03:18:40.100
So that's the power of fusion,
that's the power of, of music.

03:18:40.100 --> 03:18:42.040
Let's look at this first clip.

03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:49.540
So the first clip is between
breaks, this is a clip

03:18:49.540 --> 03:18:53.210
of all the artists who came
together to sing this song

03:18:53.210 --> 03:18:56.320
that was written by
Louie of the Peace Boys,

03:18:56.320 --> 03:18:58.800
who will be performing
tonight at Bloom Bars.

03:18:58.800 --> 03:19:00.100
&gt;&gt; [ Singing ]

03:19:00.100 --> 03:19:07.520
I am not afraid, I will
die for liberation,

03:19:07.520 --> 03:19:12.080
cause I know why I was made.

03:19:12.080 --> 03:19:15.400
I am not afraid.

03:19:15.400 --> 03:19:18.430
I am not afraid.

03:19:18.430 --> 03:19:27.180
I will die for liberation,
cause I know why I was made.

03:19:27.180 --> 03:19:36.950
I am not afraid,
I am not afraid,

03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:45.030
I will die for liberation,
cause I know why I was made.

03:19:45.030 --> 03:19:56.470
I am not afraid,
I am not afraid,

03:19:56.470 --> 03:19:59.890
I will die for liberation,
cause I know why I was made.

03:19:59.890 --> 03:20:01.190
I am not afraid --

03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:02.490
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: Okay.

03:20:02.490 --> 03:20:03.790
And, and so we, we encourage
artists that was a song

03:20:03.790 --> 03:20:05.970
that was created and so
many songs were born.

03:20:05.970 --> 03:20:07.270
So many songs were
born in that time.

03:20:07.270 --> 03:20:09.420
People went away
with inspirations

03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:11.560
that come back now
to us as songs.

03:20:11.560 --> 03:20:16.650
So this next clip is an example
of how we are very intentional

03:20:16.650 --> 03:20:20.140
about closing that gap,
and about the fusion

03:20:20.140 --> 03:20:21.790
that happens in the music.

03:20:21.790 --> 03:20:24.620
And that it echoes the movement.

03:20:24.620 --> 03:20:27.580
And we always say that
whatever we sing has

03:20:27.580 --> 03:20:30.660
to echo the message
of the movement.

03:20:30.660 --> 03:20:33.250
This is how we create
the one band, one sound.

03:20:33.250 --> 03:20:35.530
When across this whole country,

03:20:35.530 --> 03:20:38.610
we know that we're singing
certain songs on this week.

03:20:38.610 --> 03:20:41.590
We know that for the
next action we have a,

03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:43.970
a song book that we can go to

03:20:43.970 --> 03:20:46.890
and that everybody is
singing those songs.

03:20:46.890 --> 03:20:48.980
And when the cameras pan in,

03:20:48.980 --> 03:20:51.940
they hear a North
Carolina, I am not afraid.

03:20:51.940 --> 03:20:54.980
Or they hear in California,
I am not afraid, afraid.

03:20:54.980 --> 03:20:56.280
And then they start
to understand,

03:20:56.280 --> 03:20:59.630
they really must not be
afraid, they really, yeah they,

03:20:59.630 --> 03:21:01.430
and they're organized.

03:21:01.430 --> 03:21:03.840
So that's the power of
organizing through music.

03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:06.520
Let's take a look at that clip.

03:21:16.480 --> 03:22:16.910
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: And this is
at the end of the rally.

So this is [inaudible] televised

03:22:33.170 --> 03:22:34.470
but it is broadcasting
now to you guys.

03:22:34.470 --> 03:22:35.770
I'm going to tell the
[inaudible] we going to,

03:22:35.770 --> 03:22:37.070
we going to break it
down to you like that.

03:22:37.070 --> 03:22:38.370
What's it going to take

03:22:38.370 --> 03:22:39.670
to dismantle the prejudices
of your [inaudible].

03:22:39.670 --> 03:22:40.970
We're talking racism, sexism,

03:22:40.970 --> 03:22:42.270
And the [inaudible],
there's a lot of isms,

03:22:42.270 --> 03:22:43.570
that we don't need them,
there's a lot of isms,

03:22:43.570 --> 03:22:44.870
that we don't need to say, fight
the power, fight the power,

03:22:44.870 --> 03:22:46.170
say fight the power,
I say fight the power,

03:22:46.170 --> 03:22:47.470
I say fight the power.

03:22:47.470 --> 03:22:48.770

&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: And so if
you are an artist out here

03:22:51.370 --> 03:22:52.670
and you have a voice, or
you're, you're a visual artist,

03:22:52.670 --> 03:22:53.970
you're a song leader, you're
a potential song leader,

03:22:53.970 --> 03:22:57.050
you're a shower song leader,
it doesn't matter, what I,

03:22:57.050 --> 03:23:01.030
the advice that I like to leave
the artists is for singers,

03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:05.040
the acoustics are
terrible in the grave.

03:23:05.040 --> 03:23:06.860
Leave it all here.

03:23:06.860 --> 03:23:10.430
The acoustics are
terrible, visual artists,

03:23:10.430 --> 03:23:12.260
the lighting is terrible
in the grave.

03:23:12.260 --> 03:23:17.510

to help change this narrative.

&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Thank
you that was, that was amazing,

03:23:31.090 --> 03:23:33.510
let me turn it back over
to the panel and see

03:23:33.510 --> 03:23:35.560
if you all have any thoughts
or questions for each other,

03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:39.530
then we'll entertain one or two
questions from the audience.

03:23:39.530 --> 03:23:40.830
Yes, please.

03:23:40.830 --> 03:23:42.130
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: Two things.

03:23:42.130 --> 03:23:43.430
Well three things.

03:23:43.430 --> 03:23:48.020
That was, I am suppressing
the words I want to use.

03:23:48.020 --> 03:23:49.320
It was really good.

03:23:49.320 --> 03:23:50.980
Yeah. What you said
about color, I,

03:23:50.980 --> 03:23:55.340
I want to defend
color a little bit,

03:23:55.340 --> 03:24:01.020
because in the 1960's there
was no place to publish color.

03:24:01.020 --> 03:24:03.190
You couldn't develop
color in your dark room.

03:24:03.190 --> 03:24:07.040
I have a book, color photographs
coming out this year,

03:24:07.040 --> 03:24:11.410
photographs I took 1964 to 1974.

03:24:11.410 --> 03:24:14.680
It's the first time I've
found a publisher who is,

03:24:14.680 --> 03:24:18.750
these are photographs I
took in Texas prisons,

03:24:18.750 --> 03:24:20.850
which is what most
of my work is.

03:24:20.850 --> 03:24:22.390
And so it's the first time.

03:24:22.390 --> 03:24:25.900
So it, people took
color, I took some.

03:24:25.900 --> 03:24:27.480
I didn't know what I
was going to do with it.

03:24:27.480 --> 03:24:29.050
I took it just in case.

03:24:29.050 --> 03:24:30.490
And finally I got lucky.

03:24:30.490 --> 03:24:32.670
But a long time later.

03:24:32.670 --> 03:24:34.820
So I like what you did,

03:24:34.820 --> 03:24:39.110
but I want to defend the
guy who, the photographers.

03:24:39.110 --> 03:24:41.640
The, the other thing
is [inaudible],

03:24:41.640 --> 03:24:44.600
I've been listening
to all of this.

03:24:44.600 --> 03:24:47.870
And I think of a
very famous line

03:24:47.870 --> 03:24:52.380
of [inaudible] life is
understood backwards

03:24:52.380 --> 03:24:55.540
but it must be lived forwards.

03:24:55.540 --> 03:25:01.420
And I, I keep hearing about the
things that were done and things

03:25:01.420 --> 03:25:03.670
that came out of it, and
things that are happening now.

03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:09.200
And I must tell you I am very
excited and I want to thank you.

03:25:09.200 --> 03:25:10.500
All of you.

03:25:10.500 --> 03:25:12.300

[ Applause ]

03:25:16.120 --> 03:25:19.610
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter: And I, I
just want to defend myself.

03:25:19.610 --> 03:25:22.190
And the only thing
I was, I mean black

03:25:22.190 --> 03:25:23.770
and white photography
is fabulous,

03:25:23.770 --> 03:25:26.910
color photography is fabulous,
all I was, all I was attempting

03:25:26.910 --> 03:25:29.670
to say is that the ways
in which the, the media,

03:25:29.670 --> 03:25:31.740
some media can use that.

03:25:31.740 --> 03:25:33.950
And so what I was suggesting is

03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:35.960
that often times
what you find is

03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:38.700
that the media will
contrast black

03:25:38.700 --> 03:25:43.970
and white photography alongside
color photography as a way

03:25:43.970 --> 03:25:48.570
to say that again, that 1968
which was mostly in black

03:25:48.570 --> 03:25:51.910
and white meant bad, and that
color photography the future

03:25:51.910 --> 03:25:53.210
means good.

03:25:53.210 --> 03:25:55.840
And so I'm trying to say that
that's a visual trop that's used

03:25:55.840 --> 03:25:58.080
and thinking about how
do we learn our lessons.

03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:00.020
And so that's what I'm
trying to push back against.

03:26:00.020 --> 03:26:02.510
But, but that means the
photography that you do is,

03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:04.640
is amazing, whether it's
black and white or color.

03:26:04.640 --> 03:26:08.510
That's all.

03:26:08.510 --> 03:26:13.040
[ Laughter ]

03:26:13.040 --> 03:26:14.340

03:26:14.340 --> 03:26:16.140
All right.

03:26:16.140 --> 03:26:24.010
[ Laughter ]

03:26:24.010 --> 03:26:25.310
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

03:26:25.310 --> 03:26:29.190
Do you think colorizing
those old 1968 photos

03:26:29.190 --> 03:26:32.820
or maybe presenting the
current photos in black

03:26:32.820 --> 03:26:36.820
and white together with
1968 and now is something

03:26:36.820 --> 03:26:39.020
to change that narrative?

03:26:39.020 --> 03:26:40.320
&gt;&gt; Marya McQuirter:
That's, that's a really,

03:26:40.320 --> 03:26:41.630
really great question.

03:26:41.630 --> 03:26:46.420
Probably as a historian
I probably would not.

03:26:46.420 --> 03:26:49.470
And maybe as a curator I
wouldn't necessarily be in favor

03:26:49.470 --> 03:26:52.570
of it except maybe in a, in a,

03:26:52.570 --> 03:26:54.960
in a deliberate kind
of curatorial space.

03:26:54.960 --> 03:26:58.480
Like if there's, if there's
a way to, to kind of use it

03:26:58.480 --> 03:27:00.710
in a way that, that you're
acknowledging to the public

03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:03.930
that you're doing it, to try
to play with that visual trop.

03:27:03.930 --> 03:27:08.160
But one of the things that I am
interested in doing and hoping

03:27:08.160 --> 03:27:11.090
to work with some folks
here is to kind of play

03:27:11.090 --> 03:27:17.200
with this visual trop a
little bit, is to pair 1968,

03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:20.630
different kinds of 1968 with
different kinds of 2018.

03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:23.410
So for example, Taquiena Boston,

03:27:23.410 --> 03:27:26.550
you know how wonderful it would
be to have an image of her

03:27:26.550 --> 03:27:30.930
in 1968, you know, as a 14 year
old, and an image of her now

03:27:30.930 --> 03:27:36.860
in 2018, who actually works
for social justice and equity

03:27:36.860 --> 03:27:40.080
with the unitarian
universalist church.

03:27:40.080 --> 03:27:41.380
You know what I mean?

03:27:41.380 --> 03:27:43.950
So you can see that that the
way that she was impacted

03:27:43.950 --> 03:27:46.960
by the Poor People's Campaign
in '68 continues to today.

03:27:46.960 --> 03:27:48.800
So that would be kind of
what I would be interested

03:27:48.800 --> 03:27:51.630
in is pushing back
against the visual trop

03:27:51.630 --> 03:27:55.150
and just showing or, let's see.

03:27:55.150 --> 03:27:59.240
Another example might be,
yes showing Carmen Gilmore

03:27:59.240 --> 03:28:02.740
and Carole Green
in 1968 as friends,

03:28:02.740 --> 03:28:04.650
and showing them today
still as friends.

03:28:04.650 --> 03:28:06.770
So the, that would be
the way that I'd play

03:28:06.770 --> 03:28:08.100
with that visual trop.

03:28:08.100 --> 03:28:10.720
But that's, that's
an interesting idea.

03:28:10.720 --> 03:28:13.020
Thank you.

Oh yeah, I wanted to ask,

03:28:19.780 --> 03:28:24.190
I was curious, this is to
both panelists, both panels.

&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
And you, and you as well.

03:28:32.730 --> 03:28:34.810
I know I was wondering
if the folks

03:28:34.810 --> 03:28:37.970
from the campaign today
could speak to some

03:28:37.970 --> 03:28:41.130
of the international
connections that are being made

03:28:41.130 --> 03:28:42.520
with movements worldwide.

03:28:42.520 --> 03:28:46.740
And also I was curious
what, if there's lineage to

03:28:46.740 --> 03:28:52.540
or connections with the 1968
international solidarity

03:28:52.540 --> 03:28:55.910
or movements that were
connected to the campaign then.

03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:59.100
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: Would
you like then or now?

03:28:59.100 --> 03:29:02.120
Then, do you want
to do then, first?

03:29:02.120 --> 03:29:07.050
So I would, just
for the now I guess.

03:29:07.050 --> 03:29:09.570
You know I think we
are actually doing work

03:29:09.570 --> 03:29:10.870
with international folks,

03:29:10.870 --> 03:29:14.220
including that we actually had
a crew of international leaders

03:29:14.220 --> 03:29:15.990
that were with us this past week

03:29:15.990 --> 03:29:18.850
on this week on labor
and housing.

03:29:18.850 --> 03:29:22.150
And we had representatives from
five countries that joined us

03:29:22.150 --> 03:29:27.590
on Monday here in DC from
South Africa and Argentina,

03:29:27.590 --> 03:29:32.450
as well as Mexico and
where am I missing?

03:29:32.450 --> 03:29:36.490
Venezuela, Brazil, thank
you, from that [inaudible].

03:29:36.490 --> 03:29:37.870
So the [inaudible]
workers movement.

03:29:37.870 --> 03:29:40.610
So other social movements
in other countries

03:29:40.610 --> 03:29:43.370
that we've been connecting
with and learning from

03:29:43.370 --> 03:29:47.490
and sharing lessons of the,
the work that's happening here.

03:29:47.490 --> 03:29:50.400
And I think it's really
important you know

03:29:50.400 --> 03:29:51.820
that we've learned
a ton of lessons

03:29:51.820 --> 03:29:54.060
from international movements.

03:29:54.060 --> 03:29:56.370
But also I think in
folks coming here

03:29:56.370 --> 03:30:00.000
to understand you know what
people every day people

03:30:00.000 --> 03:30:03.800
in the US are dealing with here,
because what's put out in media

03:30:03.800 --> 03:30:06.040
around the world is,
is not that things are,

03:30:06.040 --> 03:30:08.180
that problems are
happening here.

03:30:08.180 --> 03:30:09.990
So the leaders like
in meeting with them,

03:30:09.990 --> 03:30:13.530
kind of after we had had
a, a session on Tuesday

03:30:13.530 --> 03:30:17.130
where folks testified, folks,
some of them that were featured

03:30:17.130 --> 03:30:21.030
in the video you saw testified
in front of Congress on Tuesday

03:30:21.030 --> 03:30:25.050
and the international leaders
that were here having a chance

03:30:25.050 --> 03:30:28.620
to meet other poor folks from
around this country, and,

03:30:28.620 --> 03:30:30.910
and just, you know, being
able to hear those stories

03:30:30.910 --> 03:30:34.340
and to be like, oh like we
can build solidarity on this.

03:30:34.340 --> 03:30:36.060
But that's really
important to be able

03:30:36.060 --> 03:30:37.590
to have those connections.

03:30:37.590 --> 03:30:41.420
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: And also a few
months ago we were in Rome,

03:30:41.420 --> 03:30:46.010
Italy with some international
leaders around labor.

03:30:46.010 --> 03:30:48.070
And they were very
interested in the campaign.

03:30:48.070 --> 03:30:51.100
And we were able to present
the campaign to them.

03:30:51.100 --> 03:30:55.030
And to have them really embrace
us was absolutely wonderful

03:30:55.030 --> 03:30:59.570
and in a couple of days
we're off to England

03:30:59.570 --> 03:31:02.410
where they are very
much interested

03:31:02.410 --> 03:31:05.710
in hearing just how
the campaign works.

03:31:05.710 --> 03:31:10.870
And they're in full
support as well.

03:31:10.870 --> 03:31:13.530
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
[Inaudible] that existed I think

03:31:13.530 --> 03:31:15.540
in full force in
the late '60s too.

03:31:15.540 --> 03:31:21.990
I mean I just had, we discovered
tapes I made in 1967 and '68

03:31:21.990 --> 03:31:23.290
with the [inaudible]
Freedom Fighters

03:31:23.290 --> 03:31:27.010
where we hear then,
then, from the MPLA.

03:31:27.010 --> 03:31:30.450
And but there was, there were
connections all the time.

03:31:30.450 --> 03:31:33.370
I mean that was part of the,
what was going on in that moment

03:31:33.370 --> 03:31:34.670
in '68 while there was

03:31:34.670 --> 03:31:37.630
such a revolutionary fervor
was it was all over the world.

03:31:37.630 --> 03:31:40.400
It was western Europe, it was
liberation movements in Africa,

03:31:40.400 --> 03:31:43.270
it was what was happening in
South America, it was Cuba,

03:31:43.270 --> 03:31:45.590
it was meeting with
the Vietnamese.

03:31:45.590 --> 03:31:47.950
You know so yes,
nothing existed.

03:31:47.950 --> 03:31:49.410
I mean that's part
of the movement was

03:31:49.410 --> 03:31:51.870
to connect those things
I think was important.

03:31:51.870 --> 03:31:54.650
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Yeah and also the Caribbean,

03:31:54.650 --> 03:31:58.560
you know [inaudible] from
Trinidad to [inaudible].

03:31:58.560 --> 03:32:01.140
But I think, thank you for the,

03:32:01.140 --> 03:32:03.530
for the visuals and
also the music.

03:32:03.530 --> 03:32:06.440
But I think the other
thing that we saw

03:32:06.440 --> 03:32:09.170
at the Poor People's Campaign
were performing artists

03:32:09.170 --> 03:32:11.710
from theater and
movies, you know.

03:32:11.710 --> 03:32:13.570
Robert Culp, Sydney Portier --

03:32:13.570 --> 03:32:14.870
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: Harry.

03:32:14.870 --> 03:32:16.790
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
Harry Belafonte, etcetera.

03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:20.600
And I'll never forget Bill
Cosby most definitely, you know.

03:32:20.600 --> 03:32:21.900
Hey, hey, hey.

03:32:21.900 --> 03:32:23.200
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: I couldn't
resist leaving that one in.

03:32:23.200 --> 03:32:24.500
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:

03:32:24.500 --> 03:32:25.800
Yeah but the funniest
one was Dick Gregory

03:32:25.800 --> 03:32:29.230
because when Dick got there
he, he had been called by SELC

03:32:29.230 --> 03:32:31.510
to come and, you know, and
he got there and he said,

03:32:31.510 --> 03:32:33.870
man I got there and
it was riots going on,

03:32:33.870 --> 03:32:37.020
people with cars turned
over, flames and everything.

03:32:37.020 --> 03:32:40.420
And I saw the brothers,
quote, looting the store,

03:32:40.420 --> 03:32:42.220
carrying this big
couch out of the store.

03:32:42.220 --> 03:32:44.780
And I, I tried to do my
thing and say brothers

03:32:44.780 --> 03:32:46.080
where you going with that couch?

03:32:46.080 --> 03:32:48.460
And the biggest one
said, we psychiatrists

03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:50.510
and we going on the house call.

03:32:50.510 --> 03:32:58.300
[ Laughter ]

03:32:58.300 --> 03:33:02.690
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson:
Can I say something.

03:33:02.690 --> 03:33:08.320
I had to change the
subject that was so good.

03:33:08.320 --> 03:33:11.650
I mentioned a list of
things going on before,

03:33:11.650 --> 03:33:13.680
and there's one I forgot
and it's really important.

03:33:13.680 --> 03:33:18.180
In 1971, September,
the Attica uprising.

03:33:18.180 --> 03:33:20.940
Because the guys in
Attica who, who did that,

03:33:20.940 --> 03:33:26.310
who organized that, and, and
I knew them, they're just

03:33:26.310 --> 03:33:28.740
like the guys who were doing
the stuff on the street.

03:33:28.740 --> 03:33:30.250
They're the same age.

03:33:30.250 --> 03:33:33.110
Come as the same
class, same background,

03:33:33.110 --> 03:33:34.410
and have the same interests.

03:33:34.410 --> 03:33:36.670
They're, if you look at
their demands basically,

03:33:36.670 --> 03:33:38.670
it's the same thing
they're after.

03:33:38.670 --> 03:33:41.650
More than one roll of toilet
paper a month, decent food,

03:33:41.650 --> 03:33:44.380
decent living conditions,
being treated fairly.

03:33:44.380 --> 03:33:48.520
That's the part of
that whole thing too.

03:33:48.520 --> 03:33:50.080
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
And also [inaudible]

03:33:50.080 --> 03:33:52.690
on a mom and pop [inaudible].

03:33:52.690 --> 03:34:00.050
The last [inaudible] and they
were in room 306 [inaudible].

03:34:00.050 --> 03:34:04.490
And you think of the maid
coming in and [inaudible].

03:34:04.490 --> 03:34:08.040
So that young lady is
what in her 30's now

03:34:08.040 --> 03:34:16.020
and during [inaudible] by
what we're talking about.

03:34:16.020 --> 03:34:17.800
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Okay.

03:34:17.800 --> 03:34:19.100
Yes.

03:34:19.100 --> 03:34:20.400
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Hi.

03:34:20.400 --> 03:34:23.190
I'm curious and this might
be more of a discussion

03:34:23.190 --> 03:34:26.690
between the old and
the new organizers.

03:34:26.690 --> 03:34:31.850
Washington DC, I mean
the past and the present.

03:34:31.850 --> 03:34:33.320
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson:
That's okay.

03:34:33.320 --> 03:34:34.620
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker:
I apologize.

03:34:34.620 --> 03:34:39.410
And I'm, yeah.

03:34:39.410 --> 03:34:44.680
Oh Washington DC
provided a lot of support,

03:34:44.680 --> 03:34:49.810
materials, wood, right, food.

03:34:49.810 --> 03:34:56.260
And what are you seeing
today in the DC residents,

03:34:56.260 --> 03:35:01.480
and what are you experiencing,
are there gaps in that or in,

03:35:01.480 --> 03:35:06.240
and how, you know, how can we
assist further as residents,

03:35:06.240 --> 03:35:12.630
and then also maybe in 1968
beyond MLK's assassination

03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:15.940
and the riots, like what
was moving the residents

03:35:15.940 --> 03:35:18.970
to actually participate so much?

03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:26.850
&gt;&gt; Reginald Jackson: Beats me.

03:35:26.850 --> 03:35:29.130
Do you know?

03:35:29.130 --> 03:35:33.120
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: Well I
mean [inaudible] I think they.

03:35:33.120 --> 03:35:37.510
Well there was a
movement happening.

03:35:37.510 --> 03:35:39.700
And people in DC were
part of the movement.

03:35:39.700 --> 03:35:43.150
I mean you know there was, there
was a lot of stuff going on.

03:35:43.150 --> 03:35:45.920
I mean U Street now
is not U Street then.

03:35:45.920 --> 03:35:49.710
Some of us who lived there
and what was going on.

03:35:49.710 --> 03:35:55.330
Snake Headquarters, Panther
Headquarters were on U Street.

03:35:55.330 --> 03:35:56.870
It was a, there was
a, there was a, we,

03:35:56.870 --> 03:36:00.440
we started the Liberation News
Service here, that was in DC

03:36:00.440 --> 03:36:03.040
at the time, Washington
Free Press.

03:36:03.040 --> 03:36:04.720
There were all these free
movement activities happening.

03:36:04.720 --> 03:36:07.880
So I mean people were involved
and they involved generations

03:36:07.880 --> 03:36:09.500
of different generations
and stuff.

03:36:09.500 --> 03:36:11.780
Crossing white and
black lines as well.

03:36:11.780 --> 03:36:14.570
DC was mostly white
or black back then.

03:36:14.570 --> 03:36:18.690
And yeah so I think there was,
it was, it was a movement.

03:36:18.690 --> 03:36:21.320
And so you always had this kind
of layers of stuff happening,

03:36:21.320 --> 03:36:23.480
no matter what city you were
in I think that, that was,

03:36:23.480 --> 03:36:24.890
that's maybe the
different today than.

03:36:24.890 --> 03:36:26.210
&gt;&gt; Unidentified Speaker: You
know I, I agree with that,

03:36:26.210 --> 03:36:27.820
and I think that the
thing that may happen

03:36:27.820 --> 03:36:33.500
in today's Washington is that
the metropolitan area is likely

03:36:33.500 --> 03:36:35.740
to be as involved as the city.

03:36:35.740 --> 03:36:37.250
Because we have in Arlington,

03:36:37.250 --> 03:36:38.550
you know we've got
little [inaudible],

03:36:38.550 --> 03:36:40.690
we've got Little Saigon,

03:36:40.690 --> 03:36:44.000
we've got all these quote
immigrant communities

03:36:44.000 --> 03:36:46.950
who have started to
organize themselves.

03:36:46.950 --> 03:36:52.750
And who recognize the legacy
of this for their future,

03:36:52.750 --> 03:36:54.890
especially in the current
political environment.

03:36:54.890 --> 03:36:59.310
So I think the metropolis is
different now than it was then.

03:36:59.310 --> 03:37:03.990
DC is more gentrified and, in
some places that's a good thing,

03:37:03.990 --> 03:37:05.590
that could, that could be
potentially a good thing

03:37:05.590 --> 03:37:08.220
for the movement, but it also
can be a problematic thing

03:37:08.220 --> 03:37:12.150
because I think the connections
to faith and the connections

03:37:12.150 --> 03:37:14.550
to some of the cultural
institutions are not what they

03:37:14.550 --> 03:37:18.490
were in 1968.

03:37:18.490 --> 03:37:20.400
So yeses and nos.

03:37:20.400 --> 03:37:23.640
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: In terms
of, of what DC is offering,

03:37:23.640 --> 03:37:29.560
and resources, you've offered
some amazing artists to us.

03:37:29.560 --> 03:37:33.910
And our base player every
Sunday night is in the building,

03:37:33.910 --> 03:37:37.230
you know for Max
meetings, he, he's in there

03:37:37.230 --> 03:37:40.290
with his upright base guitar.

03:37:40.290 --> 03:37:41.880
And so we've been able to pull

03:37:41.880 --> 03:37:45.050
from those artistic
resources here.

03:37:45.050 --> 03:37:47.250
And that's been,
that's been major.

03:37:47.250 --> 03:37:48.910
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: Yeah and
I mean all of the events

03:37:48.910 --> 03:37:52.050
that we've had here
in DC are being housed

03:37:52.050 --> 03:37:56.020
by different churches
and communities, bases.

03:37:56.020 --> 03:37:57.630
And so I think that
is important.

03:37:57.630 --> 03:37:59.700
The one thing I, you know
I think that there's,

03:37:59.700 --> 03:38:03.550
there's also a local DC
metropolitan coordinating

03:38:03.550 --> 03:38:07.660
committee that is working
to do outreach in this area.

03:38:07.660 --> 03:38:10.560
And recognizing that, you
know, you know, there is a,

03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:14.350
a kind of different reality
here in DC that there's part

03:38:14.350 --> 03:38:15.910
of a national but
also really wanting

03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:19.430
to have local organizing that's
happening be foundational

03:38:19.430 --> 03:38:20.730
in the campaign.

03:38:20.730 --> 03:38:22.180
You know, as in the states.

03:38:22.180 --> 03:38:24.980
But the other piece,
just quickly in terms

03:38:24.980 --> 03:38:26.890
of Maggie your question.

03:38:26.890 --> 03:38:28.890
You know I also think
we're at a different moment

03:38:28.890 --> 03:38:33.860
in the Poor People's
Campaign than we were in '68.

03:38:33.860 --> 03:38:38.340
In '68 we were coming from years
of organizing like together

03:38:38.340 --> 03:38:41.000
and it was, you know, kind
of a not a combination

03:38:41.000 --> 03:38:43.190
because that organizing
still was going on.

03:38:43.190 --> 03:38:46.220
But I think we're at a more
beginning stage right now.

03:38:46.220 --> 03:38:49.040
And so I think now is a great
time to ask that question

03:38:49.040 --> 03:38:51.150
because I think there's,
there is like so much more

03:38:51.150 --> 03:38:53.250
than we can start doing
to organize together.

03:38:53.250 --> 03:38:56.260
And so just to notice that
it's a different stage

03:38:56.260 --> 03:38:59.310
and so how we can take advantage
of that, like starting to seed,

03:38:59.310 --> 03:39:02.660
you know, how do we plant the
seeds now that can continue

03:39:02.660 --> 03:39:05.520
to grow, because we're just
at the start of this campaign

03:39:05.520 --> 03:39:07.770
and this 40 days is a launch.

03:39:07.770 --> 03:39:10.110
And so looking to, to
be able to continue

03:39:10.110 --> 03:39:11.910
to build with folks here.

03:39:11.910 --> 03:39:16.220
&gt;&gt; Guha Shankar: I'm sorry I'm
going to have to stop right now

03:39:16.220 --> 03:39:17.910
because we're coming up
on the end of our time.

03:39:17.910 --> 03:39:23.470
But I was hoping to get Yara and
Charon to take us out in a song,

03:39:23.470 --> 03:39:24.810
which would make
a great transition

03:39:24.810 --> 03:39:28.410
to our summary speaker, the
Reverend Dr. Liz Theoharis.

03:39:28.410 --> 03:39:31.450
And while I'm at it, I
want to put in a plug

03:39:31.450 --> 03:39:33.520
for a wonderful exhibition.

03:39:33.520 --> 03:39:35.690
My colleague and
friend, Kelly [inaudible]

03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:39.790
from the National Museum
of African American History

03:39:39.790 --> 03:39:41.870
and Culture, who is right
there in the audience.

03:39:41.870 --> 03:39:43.170
Oral Historian.

03:39:43.170 --> 03:39:45.620
Is part of the wonderful
team of colleagues

03:39:45.620 --> 03:39:48.720
who have this exhibition of
the Poor People's Campaign

03:39:48.720 --> 03:39:51.360
at the Museum of
American History.

03:39:51.360 --> 03:39:52.830
So all of you who
are here really need

03:39:52.830 --> 03:39:54.940
to go avail yourself
of doing that.

03:39:54.940 --> 03:39:59.020
NMHC has been, and here's
a shameless political party

03:39:59.020 --> 03:40:00.320
political announcement.

03:40:00.320 --> 03:40:02.970
The NMHC has been our partners
at the Library of Congress

03:40:02.970 --> 03:40:06.360
with the Civil Rights History
Project and you can see some

03:40:06.360 --> 03:40:10.300
of the videos, including the
testimonials from members

03:40:10.300 --> 03:40:13.390
of the Poor People's Camp,
people who came here in 1968

03:40:13.390 --> 03:40:15.500
with the, the mostly
Latino contingent

03:40:15.500 --> 03:40:18.150
for the 1968 campaign.

03:40:18.150 --> 03:40:22.530
Those are available and on, on
our website, our joint website.

03:40:22.530 --> 03:40:24.630
And so that's a part of what,

03:40:24.630 --> 03:40:27.070
I want to bring this back full
circle to what John Fenn started

03:40:27.070 --> 03:40:30.180
out the morning with today about
how to cultural institutions,

03:40:30.180 --> 03:40:34.170
institutions of cultural memory
if you will, sustain these kinds

03:40:34.170 --> 03:40:36.640
of memories, these
kinds of histories,

03:40:36.640 --> 03:40:38.850
for the benefit of
future audiences.

03:40:38.850 --> 03:40:42.970
And I think Nick and Maggie and
Marya and others have alluded

03:40:42.970 --> 03:40:47.450
to the fact that we are part
of that effort going forward

03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:50.450
to make sure that future
generations don't forget what's

03:40:50.450 --> 03:40:51.750
come before.

03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:53.050
So with that being said,

03:40:53.050 --> 03:40:55.910
as I said that's my paid
political party announcement.

03:40:55.910 --> 03:40:58.390
Let me get, if I would, if
I would prevail upon Yara

03:40:58.390 --> 03:41:00.220
and Charon to take us out.

03:41:00.220 --> 03:41:01.520
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: Oh well.

03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:02.820
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: Okay.

03:41:02.820 --> 03:41:05.940
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: Well the first
thing we're going to ask is,

03:41:05.940 --> 03:41:09.470
and we say this in the movement,
is that we stand together.

03:41:09.470 --> 03:41:14.320
And the reason that we do that
is because we stand together.

03:41:14.320 --> 03:41:15.660
All right.

03:41:15.660 --> 03:41:17.960
And we always have to
do a check of the room.

03:41:17.960 --> 03:41:19.770
That's everywhere, we're
not picking on you.

03:41:19.770 --> 03:41:21.070
Where are the altos?

03:41:21.070 --> 03:41:24.630
Altos? Where are the sopranos?

03:41:24.630 --> 03:41:25.930
Where are the tenors?

03:41:25.930 --> 03:41:30.420
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: All
the way in the back.

03:41:30.420 --> 03:41:33.020
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: Base baritone?

03:41:33.020 --> 03:41:38.620
And the people we love so
dearly, I have no idea.

03:41:38.620 --> 03:41:42.550
Now it never fails that every
time we ask that question some

03:41:42.550 --> 03:41:45.250
of the same people who raised
their hands before go up again.

03:41:45.250 --> 03:41:48.140
So that was your
moment of confession.

03:41:48.140 --> 03:41:50.560
And, and I have to leave this
tip, if you're a little shy

03:41:50.560 --> 03:41:53.610
about singing in public,
and you're in the shower,

03:41:53.610 --> 03:41:57.300
especially if you have tile
on the floor, turn that shower

03:41:57.300 --> 03:41:59.110
on full force, and
listen to that applause.

03:41:59.110 --> 03:42:01.360
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: There you go.

03:42:01.360 --> 03:42:03.810
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: And you
can sing as loud and wrong

03:42:03.810 --> 03:42:05.270
as you want to, it's okay,

03:42:05.270 --> 03:42:07.530
because you have a
captive audience.

03:42:07.530 --> 03:42:09.320
Okay. We're going to, Charon.

03:42:09.320 --> 03:42:12.790
&gt;&gt; Charon Hribar: Everybody's

we were talking about you
know bridging then and now,

03:42:15.760 --> 03:42:17.100
so we're going to take us

03:42:17.100 --> 03:42:18.700
out with everybody's
got a right to live.

03:42:18.700 --> 03:42:20.590
&gt;&gt; Yara Allen: And be
careful that end, that,

03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:23.410
that little piece that the
young people tagged on.

03:42:23.410 --> 03:42:27.100

to get a little loud in here.

&gt;&gt; Liz Theoharis: So it's really
good to be here with folks.

03:44:58.590 --> 03:45:01.610
I wanted to do one quick thing.

03:45:01.610 --> 03:45:04.890
So who here has some
personal connection

03:45:04.890 --> 03:45:08.960
to the 19648 Poor
People's Campaign?

03:45:08.960 --> 03:45:12.580
So we just need to give those
folks a huge round of applause.

03:45:13.860 --> 03:45:17.850
We are standing on
great shoulders.

03:45:20.410 --> 03:45:26.350
So it is really humbling to be
here especially to be with folks

03:45:26.350 --> 03:45:30.360
that were a part of
such an important moment

03:45:30.360 --> 03:45:32.780
in this country's history.

03:45:32.780 --> 03:45:39.380

thanks for the folks that were

03:45:39.380 --> 03:45:41.020
on the front lines
and for the folks

03:45:41.020 --> 03:45:42.840
that have documented
that history.

03:45:42.840 --> 03:45:47.770
And, and made it so that
we, we cannot forget it.

03:45:47.770 --> 03:45:50.730
So I am Reverend
Dr. Liz Theoharis.

03:45:50.730 --> 03:45:53.930
I am one of the co-chairs of
the Poor People's Campaign,

03:45:53.930 --> 03:45:56.360
a National Call for
More Revival.

03:45:56.360 --> 03:45:57.660
The other co-chair

03:45:57.660 --> 03:46:00.350
of the campaign is
Reverend Dr. William Barber

03:46:00.350 --> 03:46:04.720
out of North Carolina and he is
in Michigan and Chicago today

03:46:04.720 --> 03:46:07.150
and sends his love and regards.

03:46:07.150 --> 03:46:12.200
He was in Kentucky yesterday,
and as Yara said will be heading

03:46:12.200 --> 03:46:14.760
to Liverpool, England tomorrow.

03:46:14.760 --> 03:46:16.650
So there's a lot of moving

03:46:16.650 --> 03:46:19.530
around that's going
on right now.

03:46:19.530 --> 03:46:24.740
But we are on week
five of six weeks

03:46:24.740 --> 03:46:30.150
of what we call nonviolent
moral fusion direct action.

03:46:30.150 --> 03:46:32.870
So the Poor People's
Campaign, a national call

03:46:32.870 --> 03:46:38.630
for more revival comes out
of years of organizing,

03:46:38.630 --> 03:46:42.430
years of learning and studying,

03:46:42.430 --> 03:46:46.060
years of poor people
kind of rising up.

03:46:46.060 --> 03:46:48.370
And so the, from the
tens of thousands

03:46:48.370 --> 03:46:51.760
of families whose water have
been shut off in Detroit,

03:46:51.760 --> 03:46:57.310
Michigan, to the, the family
members of people who have died

03:46:57.310 --> 03:46:59.600
because of the lack of
healthcare in Alabama,

03:46:59.600 --> 03:47:04.260
and North Carolina, and
Vermont and all over this space

03:47:04.260 --> 03:47:06.790
to the thousands of immigrants

03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:12.200
on our nation's border
crying for hugs, not walls.

03:47:12.200 --> 03:47:14.880
And actually going
into the Rio Grande

03:47:14.880 --> 03:47:20.810
and hugging their family
members in, in that water.

03:47:20.810 --> 03:47:25.350
To, to the families in
Mans County, Alabama right

03:47:25.350 --> 03:47:27.830
in between Selma and Montgomery,

03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:30.450
the home of the Black
Panther Party,

03:47:30.450 --> 03:47:35.270
but who in 2018 still do
not have sanitation services

03:47:35.270 --> 03:47:38.430
and there is raw sewage
in people's yards.

03:47:38.430 --> 03:47:41.990
A third of the population
has parasites,

03:47:41.990 --> 03:47:45.750
parasites that people
thought were eradicated,

03:47:45.750 --> 03:47:48.520
but have reemerged
because of climate change.

03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:53.340
To homeless encampments in
Washington state and Oregon.

03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:57.650
Poor people across this
country have been crying out,

03:47:57.650 --> 03:48:00.330
are still crying out,
and are coming together

03:48:00.330 --> 03:48:02.170
that we want to be free.

03:48:02.170 --> 03:48:05.050
And that we need a
Poor People's Campaign.

03:48:05.050 --> 03:48:09.310
We need a moral revival in this
land to make this country great

03:48:09.310 --> 03:48:12.730
for many that it
has never yet been.

03:48:12.730 --> 03:48:19.200
And so we see right now a moral
movement afoot in this country.

03:48:19.200 --> 03:48:24.810
And, and what we know from
history is when poor people,

03:48:24.810 --> 03:48:28.690
and other people impacted
by injustice ban together

03:48:28.690 --> 03:48:31.590
with clergy and religious
leaders, with activists

03:48:31.590 --> 03:48:34.330
and advocates, only
then can we kind

03:48:34.330 --> 03:48:37.370
of change the course of history.

03:48:37.370 --> 03:48:41.420
So you know what we
did before we started

03:48:41.420 --> 03:48:44.180
out with this campaign,
the Poor People's Campaign

03:48:44.180 --> 03:48:47.310
and National Call for Moral
Revival was we commissioned

03:48:47.310 --> 03:48:48.750

it was done by the Institute

for Policy studies and
by the Urban Institute

03:49:03.590 --> 03:49:07.420

that today, in 2018,

03:49:11.850 --> 03:49:16.770
there are 60% more poor
people than in 1968.

03:49:16.770 --> 03:49:22.600
That today, in 2018 we have,
we have fewer voting rights

03:49:22.600 --> 03:49:26.030
than we did 50 years ago.

03:49:26.030 --> 03:49:33.870
That today in, in 2018, we have
more deaths because of pollution

03:49:33.870 --> 03:49:38.070
and the, you know
the, the lead in water

03:49:38.070 --> 03:49:39.370
and other kinds of things.

03:49:39.370 --> 03:49:44.280
And, and so what, what
that compels us to do is

03:49:44.280 --> 03:49:47.380
to organize, organize, organize.

03:49:47.380 --> 03:49:51.340
So what we've been trying
to do in this campaign is,

03:49:51.340 --> 03:49:55.670
is raise awareness, that,
that 140 million people

03:49:55.670 --> 03:49:58.900
in this country are
poor and low income.

03:49:58.900 --> 03:50:02.780
That that is 43.5%
of the population.

03:50:02.780 --> 03:50:05.460
That 80% of people in the
United States at some point

03:50:05.460 --> 03:50:08.990
in our lives will
experience poverty.

03:50:08.990 --> 03:50:11.470
So this is not some small
problem for some group

03:50:11.470 --> 03:50:16.420
over here, this is a,
a major moral travesty.

03:50:16.420 --> 03:50:20.020
This is a major epidemic.

03:50:20.020 --> 03:50:24.220
And that, that 51%
of kids living

03:50:24.220 --> 03:50:27.170
in this country right today
didn't have enough food this

03:50:27.170 --> 03:50:30.100
morning, they're living
in food insecure homes.

03:50:30.100 --> 03:50:34.800
Half of the kids in our country.

03:50:34.800 --> 03:50:41.350
We spend $0.53 to every $1 on
the military and only $0.15 on,

03:50:41.350 --> 03:50:44.420
and those numbers
have also gotten worse

03:50:44.420 --> 03:50:46.910
in the past 50 years.

03:50:46.910 --> 03:50:52.440
You know when Dr. King and
others called for this kind

03:50:52.440 --> 03:50:56.970
of tri partied evils, and,
and taking on the militarism,

03:50:56.970 --> 03:51:02.190
racism, and poverty all
together, like that,

03:51:02.190 --> 03:51:05.820
that showed that we
could only get rid of one

03:51:05.820 --> 03:51:07.690
if we got rid of all of them.

03:51:07.690 --> 03:51:11.130
And, and what has happened over
the past 50 years is that all

03:51:11.130 --> 03:51:14.440
of those things have
gotten worse for people.

03:51:14.440 --> 03:51:18.310
And so we, we have been
traveling around the country,

03:51:18.310 --> 03:51:21.770
and right now we are
engaged in 40 days of,

03:51:21.770 --> 03:51:23.530
of nonviolent civil disobedience

03:51:23.530 --> 03:51:26.480
and organizing across
the country.

03:51:26.480 --> 03:51:32.630
We launched on May 14th, and
what historians have told us,

03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:35.030
this isn't what we've
told ourselves,

03:51:35.030 --> 03:51:39.680
that we do announce it, like
I am now, that, that what,

03:51:39.680 --> 03:51:42.580
what has been going on over
the past five weeks is the most

03:51:42.580 --> 03:51:44.680
expansive, and the largest wave

03:51:44.680 --> 03:51:48.240
of nonviolent civil disobedience
in the 21st Century.

03:51:48.240 --> 03:51:50.660
So since already.

03:51:50.660 --> 03:51:52.760
So that is really
something, right.

03:51:52.760 --> 03:51:56.440
And, and, and that's
happening in close to 40 states

03:51:56.440 --> 03:51:59.090
across the country and
here in Washington DC.

03:51:59.090 --> 03:52:02.260
So just to, to say a
little bit about what

03:52:02.260 --> 03:52:04.880
that has been is that, you know,

03:52:04.880 --> 03:52:08.610
for five consecutive weeks poor
people and clergy, activists

03:52:08.610 --> 03:52:11.560
and advocates have
marched on state capitals,

03:52:11.560 --> 03:52:13.860
have taken over state
capitals, have been locked

03:52:13.860 --> 03:52:16.320
out of state capitals,
have closed the streets

03:52:16.320 --> 03:52:21.060
around their capitals, you know,
singing songs like on that,

03:52:21.060 --> 03:52:23.940
that Ms. Yara Allen wrote,
somebody's hurting our people

03:52:23.940 --> 03:52:25.510
and it's gone on
for far too long,

03:52:25.510 --> 03:52:28.130
and we won't be silent anymore.

03:52:28.130 --> 03:52:30.290
Sitting, you know,
sitting in the capital,

03:52:30.290 --> 03:52:32.700
being locked in all night.

03:52:32.700 --> 03:52:35.920
Singing we shall not be moved.

03:52:35.920 --> 03:52:38.480
Being out on the streets
in front of capitals,

03:52:38.480 --> 03:52:40.040
singing everybody's
got a right to live,

03:52:40.040 --> 03:52:43.850
and before this campaign
fades, fails, we'll all go

03:52:43.850 --> 03:52:48.780
down to jail, as being are
being carted off to, to jail.

03:52:48.780 --> 03:52:52.880
And still committing to, and,
and there's been a response.

03:52:52.880 --> 03:52:56.950
So, so we can tell that
it's being noticed.

03:52:56.950 --> 03:52:59.950
In Kentucky, two weeks ago,

03:52:59.950 --> 03:53:02.780
hundreds of people
were denied entrance

03:53:02.780 --> 03:53:05.510
to the state capital there.

03:53:05.510 --> 03:53:07.610
We found out, looking
at history,

03:53:07.610 --> 03:53:12.640
that the NRA did a really nice
rally in that state capital not

03:53:12.640 --> 03:53:16.420
so long ago, and they got to
bring their AK 47's, but when,

03:53:16.420 --> 03:53:20.570
when peaceful poor
clergy protestors came

03:53:20.570 --> 03:53:23.770
into the state capital in
Kentucky a couple weeks ago,

03:53:23.770 --> 03:53:27.380
they were told that
they, they couldn't come.

03:53:27.380 --> 03:53:30.950
In New Jersey, they've been
arrested before they can even

03:53:30.950 --> 03:53:33.020
get close to their capital.

03:53:33.020 --> 03:53:35.140
They've been trying
to cut people short,

03:53:35.140 --> 03:53:37.820
and that's happened
three weeks in a row now.

03:53:37.820 --> 03:53:39.850
In Arkansas, they've
been getting threats

03:53:39.850 --> 03:53:42.830
that if they keep on
coming, they'll be, you know,

03:53:42.830 --> 03:53:45.280
not just banned from
the capital but banned

03:53:45.280 --> 03:53:47.940
from the whole surrounding area.

03:53:47.940 --> 03:53:50.720
In Kansas, when folks got,

03:53:50.720 --> 03:53:53.190
the nonviolence civil
disobedience a couple

03:53:53.190 --> 03:53:56.290
of weeks ago, on
their citations,

03:53:56.290 --> 03:53:58.390
like on the violations, it,

03:53:58.390 --> 03:54:01.900
it called the capital
itself the victim.

03:54:01.900 --> 03:54:05.300
And it banned people from,
from going back to the, the --

03:54:05.300 --> 03:54:09.150
you know, and potentially
hurting that victim, that,

03:54:09.150 --> 03:54:12.060
that capital that is
actually passing policies

03:54:12.060 --> 03:54:13.940
where people's lives are dying

03:54:13.940 --> 03:54:17.210
because of what's
been happening there.

03:54:17.210 --> 03:54:20.600
In, in Massachusetts homeless
vets set up an encampment,

03:54:20.600 --> 03:54:24.970
right before Memorial Day, that
was taken down, dismantled,

03:54:24.970 --> 03:54:27.650
you know, just like homeless
encampments are being dismantled

03:54:27.650 --> 03:54:28.990
all across this country,

03:54:28.990 --> 03:54:32.920
just like Resurrection City
was dismantled at the, at the,

03:54:32.920 --> 03:54:36.680
you know, kind of conclusion
of or not the conclusion,

03:54:36.680 --> 03:54:39.770
that made for you
know, the dismantling.

03:54:39.770 --> 03:54:44.420
In, in New Hampshire, a bunch

03:54:44.420 --> 03:54:47.130
of white supremacists
organizations came

03:54:47.130 --> 03:54:50.640
and threatened the
campaign leaders there.

03:54:50.640 --> 03:54:53.880
In Mississippi, when they did
their first press conference,

03:54:53.880 --> 03:54:55.970
they brought dogs on folks.

03:54:55.970 --> 03:55:00.060
When they did their
third protest,

03:55:00.060 --> 03:55:02.360
someone with guns came
and threatened folks.

03:55:02.360 --> 03:55:06.360
I mean so, so this is,
this is 2018, right.

03:55:06.360 --> 03:55:08.800
This is folks trying
to organize in,

03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:11.500
in Alaska yes, Alaska
is involved.

03:55:11.500 --> 03:55:13.530
Who knew there were
people organizing

03:55:13.530 --> 03:55:15.030
in Alaska, it's amazing.

03:55:15.030 --> 03:55:17.760
At, at their training

03:55:17.760 --> 03:55:20.360
for nonviolent civil
disobedience someone came

03:55:20.360 --> 03:55:22.930
and bear maced them.

03:55:22.930 --> 03:55:25.320
And people said, we're
going to wash off,

03:55:25.320 --> 03:55:27.290
we're going to go back, we're
going to learn from history

03:55:27.290 --> 03:55:29.290
and we're going to figure out
what it looks like for people

03:55:29.290 --> 03:55:30.730
to keep on organizing.

03:55:30.730 --> 03:55:34.150
And so there is, there
is something happening

03:55:34.150 --> 03:55:35.450
in this country.

03:55:35.450 --> 03:55:41.310
There is a powerful and
mighty grass roots movement

03:55:41.310 --> 03:55:44.170
that is, that is rising up.

03:55:44.170 --> 03:55:45.960
And, and I have been involved

03:55:45.960 --> 03:55:49.060
in grass roots antipoverty
organizing for 25 years.

03:55:49.060 --> 03:55:52.540
And I have never seen
anything like it.

03:55:52.540 --> 03:55:56.950
To see folks coming forward,
and committing their lives,

03:55:56.950 --> 03:55:59.850
especially folks that
don't have homes,

03:55:59.850 --> 03:56:03.510
that do not have living wages,
that do not have healthcare,

03:56:03.510 --> 03:56:07.130
that votes have been suppressed,
that's kids have died

03:56:07.130 --> 03:56:10.220
in their arms, just
because of poverty.

03:56:10.220 --> 03:56:14.460
You know, or because of the
poisoning of their water,

03:56:14.460 --> 03:56:17.110
or because of the
pollution in the air.

03:56:17.110 --> 03:56:19.470
And to see folks
saying, you know, at --

03:56:19.470 --> 03:56:21.330
in the words of Nick
Smith who was at one

03:56:21.330 --> 03:56:24.400
of our rallies a couple of weeks
ago from the Fight for Fifteen,

03:56:24.400 --> 03:56:29.520
our backs are against the wall,
and all we can do is push.

03:56:29.520 --> 03:56:32.870
And just to kind of see
that coming out of, and --

03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:35.960
and so, so we have learned
a bunch from history.

03:56:35.960 --> 03:56:38.220
And it's part of the reason
we have to honor those

03:56:38.220 --> 03:56:40.610
that have come before us.

03:56:40.610 --> 03:56:43.810
You know so, so we started
with the triple evils

03:56:43.810 --> 03:56:46.430
that Dr. King was talking about,

03:56:46.430 --> 03:56:49.010
that the Poor People's
Campaign was, was talking about,

03:56:49.010 --> 03:56:52.960
that poor people being the
Achilles heel of militarism,

03:56:52.960 --> 03:56:56.960
of racism, and of you know,
economic exploitation.

03:56:56.960 --> 03:56:59.830
But in our travels across
the country, as we were kind

03:56:59.830 --> 03:57:02.580
of calling for and
organizing this campaign,

03:57:02.580 --> 03:57:05.070
we found that in every
community that we went

03:57:05.070 --> 03:57:08.440
to that had poor folk,
there was some form

03:57:08.440 --> 03:57:09.750
of ecological devastation

03:57:09.750 --> 03:57:13.550
that was impacting those
people by far the most.

03:57:13.550 --> 03:57:16.300
And it became impossible
actually to talk

03:57:16.300 --> 03:57:19.420
about these issues without then
talking about the poisoning

03:57:19.420 --> 03:57:22.590
of water, the, the
extreme extraction,

03:57:22.590 --> 03:57:24.980
the fracking that's going on.

03:57:24.980 --> 03:57:28.340
And you know, the gas
incinerators being

03:57:28.340 --> 03:57:29.640
in poor communities.

03:57:29.640 --> 03:57:32.930
And so, so we said okay,
well we're going to learn

03:57:32.930 --> 03:57:35.010
from actually some of the
young people that were

03:57:35.010 --> 03:57:36.820
at Resurrection City in '68

03:57:36.820 --> 03:57:38.720
because there's some
amazing quotes.

03:57:38.720 --> 03:57:41.380
You know people date the
environmental movement

03:57:41.380 --> 03:57:43.950
to wait after the last '60s.

03:57:43.950 --> 03:57:47.320
But there are powerful
quotes from the '68 campaign

03:57:47.320 --> 03:57:48.710
where young people
that are living

03:57:48.710 --> 03:57:51.980
at that Resurrection
City say, you know,

03:57:51.980 --> 03:57:56.420
in my lifetime this environment
is going to be a major issue.

03:57:56.420 --> 03:57:59.260
I mean because people could
see that the degrading of life

03:57:59.260 --> 03:58:02.600
and everything, like
what, you know, how,

03:58:02.600 --> 03:58:03.900
how important that was.

03:58:03.900 --> 03:58:06.920
And so, but then we've
also realized that,

03:58:06.920 --> 03:58:09.990
that what ties those
four evils together,

03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:14.870
what ties systemic racism,
systemic poverty, militarism

03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:16.170
and the war economy

03:58:16.170 --> 03:58:18.990
and ecological devastation
together is a distorted

03:58:18.990 --> 03:58:20.750
moral narrative.

03:58:20.750 --> 03:58:25.550
A moral narrative that blames
poor people for our problems,

03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:29.160
that tries to pit us against
each other, and that claims

03:58:29.160 --> 03:58:32.180
that there is scarcity when
we're living in a society,

03:58:32.180 --> 03:58:33.480
in a world of abundance.

03:58:33.480 --> 03:58:36.890
And so, so we, we've said
that another one of the evils

03:58:36.890 --> 03:58:41.250
that we have to take on in this
day is this distorted moral

03:58:41.250 --> 03:58:42.550
narrative that is propagated

03:58:42.550 --> 03:58:45.380
by these religious
Christian nationalists.

03:58:45.380 --> 03:58:48.990
And, and that we have to,
we have to call that out,

03:58:48.990 --> 03:58:52.320
and we have to show that
something else is possible.

03:58:52.320 --> 03:58:54.790
And that a new narrative
is possible and,

03:58:54.790 --> 03:58:56.570
and coming through.

03:58:56.570 --> 03:59:00.090
So, so that's one of the
lessons that we, we took.

03:59:00.090 --> 03:59:03.160
Another, another lesson
is, is the need to organize

03:59:03.160 --> 03:59:07.380
and unite the poor across
all the lines that divide us.

03:59:07.380 --> 03:59:10.290
And so what you see in some of
the photos, and some of the,

03:59:10.290 --> 03:59:13.850
the songs that, that Yara
and Charon were showing,

03:59:13.850 --> 03:59:17.820
I mean is a multiracial
intergenerational

03:59:17.820 --> 03:59:21.510
across geography, you know,
rural, urban, exurban, suburban.

03:59:21.510 --> 03:59:25.280
Like, you know, movement of
people, young, old, queer,

03:59:25.280 --> 03:59:29.070
straight, Muslim, Jewish,
Christian, Buddhists.

03:59:29.070 --> 03:59:32.980
Like I mean really like it's not
that it's like a cumbia moment

03:59:32.980 --> 03:59:35.150
where everyone just like
grabs hands together and says,

03:59:35.150 --> 03:59:36.450
can't we all get along.

03:59:36.450 --> 03:59:40.250
But is just that people
out of suffering are seeing

03:59:40.250 --> 03:59:42.070
who else can we ban
together with.

03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:45.460
And, and it's, it's happening,
like you know just to,

03:59:45.460 --> 03:59:48.530
to be in a mass meeting in
Albuquerque, New Mexico,

03:59:48.530 --> 03:59:53.230
and have a Muslim woman doing a
call to prayer at the same time

03:59:53.230 --> 03:59:55.590
that an indigenous woman
is doing, you know,

03:59:55.590 --> 03:59:58.410
honoring a spirit
ceremony to have, you know,

03:59:58.410 --> 04:00:02.630
folks break into tongues in
the Pentecostal tradition

04:00:02.630 --> 04:00:06.190
and to have, you know, poor
white, poor black, poor Latino,

04:00:06.190 --> 04:00:10.870
poor Muslim, poor indigenous
folks all saying we're

04:00:10.870 --> 04:00:12.740
in this together.

04:00:12.740 --> 04:00:16.800
I mean it's, it's, it's a
powerful, it's a powerful thing.

04:00:16.800 --> 04:00:20.370
And, and we have learned
that that isn't easy.

04:00:20.370 --> 04:00:22.840
And we've learned that through
history and we've learned

04:00:22.840 --> 04:00:26.680
that through our
experience, right, where, but,

04:00:26.680 --> 04:00:31.280
but you know I was talking to,
you know -- Then the another,

04:00:31.280 --> 04:00:34.490
a huge piece of history that is,

04:00:34.490 --> 04:00:37.110
is the power of the
people, right.

04:00:37.110 --> 04:00:40.490
The power of poor people
to be able to make change.

04:00:40.490 --> 04:00:45.340
So we're not waiting for
those in power to, to save us.

04:00:45.340 --> 04:00:48.770
We're not going to
the national leaders

04:00:48.770 --> 04:00:51.520
and the national organizations
to say, are you going

04:00:51.520 --> 04:00:53.260
to come together
around these issues.

04:00:53.260 --> 04:00:55.420
This has come from
the bottom up.

04:00:55.420 --> 04:00:57.920
And, and who has been
calling for this?

04:00:57.920 --> 04:00:59.830
Who are the leaders
in this campaign?

04:00:59.830 --> 04:01:02.800
Are just regular
people, are poor people

04:01:02.800 --> 04:01:04.660
that have been suffering
for a long time,

04:01:04.660 --> 04:01:07.600
organizing for a long time,
but now coming together.

04:01:07.600 --> 04:01:10.990
And, and so one of the things
that people really critiqued us

04:01:10.990 --> 04:01:14.220
for at the beginning
of this campaign was,

04:01:14.220 --> 04:01:17.140
well you don't have all of the
national organizations on board.

04:01:17.140 --> 04:01:19.290
And we said, we're
not going there,

04:01:19.290 --> 04:01:20.840
we're going to the states.

04:01:20.840 --> 04:01:22.340
We're going to the
grassroots leaders.

04:01:22.340 --> 04:01:23.870
And, and from there,

04:01:23.870 --> 04:01:26.800
126 national organizations
have come on board.

04:01:26.800 --> 04:01:30.730
From there, nine or ten major
religious denominations have

04:01:30.730 --> 04:01:32.030
been on board.

04:01:32.030 --> 04:01:34.440
And, and with them
getting on board isn't just

04:01:34.440 --> 04:01:37.330
like saying they're going to pat
us on the back, what them being

04:01:37.330 --> 04:01:41.660
on board means is that
their, their top leaders are,

04:01:41.660 --> 04:01:43.700
are doing the civil
disobedience,

04:01:43.700 --> 04:01:46.400
arm and arm with a Five
for Fifteen Worker.

04:01:46.400 --> 04:01:49.110
What it means it is that
they're, they're having the,

04:01:49.110 --> 04:01:51.710
the people in their
organizations figure

04:01:51.710 --> 04:01:55.280
out what it looks like to
actually work on a regular basis

04:01:55.280 --> 04:01:57.460
to build from the bottom
up in all the states

04:01:57.460 --> 04:01:58.940
that they have national
membership.

04:01:58.940 --> 04:02:04.070
And so, and so like what, what
we're seeing is, is you know,

04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:07.910
a flipping of the script,
where it's not that you have,

04:02:07.910 --> 04:02:12.700
you know, you know, big
important politicians

04:02:12.700 --> 04:02:15.060
or elected, or candidates
or, or other kind

04:02:15.060 --> 04:02:18.020
of known national leaders,
you have, you have the people

04:02:18.020 --> 04:02:19.320
who are coming together.

04:02:19.320 --> 04:02:24.610
And, but, and -- and then
another piece of, of history is

04:02:24.610 --> 04:02:30.680
that we are, are organizing
here in Washington DC.

04:02:30.680 --> 04:02:34.590
And it's happening in almost
40 states across the country.

04:02:34.590 --> 04:02:37.320
And what that looks
like is that you know,

04:02:37.320 --> 04:02:39.300
there are state coordinating
committees made

04:02:39.300 --> 04:02:42.820
up of a read diversity of
folks all across the country.

04:02:42.820 --> 04:02:47.420
And that we got from leaders
from '68, which was that,

04:02:47.420 --> 04:02:51.730
how do you build from the ground
up, how do you have an actual,

04:02:51.730 --> 04:02:54.790
you know, movement with
roots in the ground.

04:02:54.790 --> 04:02:59.090
Because where policies that
are being passed in particular

04:02:59.090 --> 04:03:03.160
that hurt people, that have
a long staying power is

04:03:03.160 --> 04:03:04.460
in people's state capitals.

04:03:04.460 --> 04:03:08.320
And so what does it look
like for us to, to you know,

04:03:08.320 --> 04:03:11.080
not say it's a national movement
because it has a P.O. Box

04:03:11.080 --> 04:03:13.660
in Washington DC, but
it's a national movement

04:03:13.660 --> 04:03:16.050
because we're nationalizing
state based

04:03:16.050 --> 04:03:17.780
and local based movements.

04:03:17.780 --> 04:03:20.760
And, and connecting them,
and, and building them out.

04:03:20.760 --> 04:03:25.320
And so, so you know
there's something,

04:03:25.320 --> 04:03:26.710
there's something going on and,

04:03:26.710 --> 04:03:30.700
and we want to invite folks
to, to be a part of that.

04:03:30.700 --> 04:03:34.200
Because what these 40
days have been is a launch

04:03:34.200 --> 04:03:37.360
of a first phase of a
Poor People's Campaign,

04:03:37.360 --> 04:03:39.160
and a national call
for moral revival.

04:03:39.160 --> 04:03:42.620
And, and what we've, what
we've seen is that people all

04:03:42.620 --> 04:03:48.110
across the country are,
are ready for a long fight.

04:03:48.110 --> 04:03:52.610
The, the problems of 140
million people being poor didn't

04:03:52.610 --> 04:03:53.910
happen overnight.

04:03:53.910 --> 04:03:56.100
The fact that there
are 37 million people

04:03:56.100 --> 04:03:58.640
without healthcare, that
didn't happen overnight.

04:03:58.640 --> 04:04:02.350
The fact that there are
four million households,

04:04:02.350 --> 04:04:05.070
when they turned on their water
this morning, there was lead

04:04:05.070 --> 04:04:07.550
in their water, like that
didn't happen overnight.

04:04:07.550 --> 04:04:09.920
So it's not going to
be overnight that all

04:04:09.920 --> 04:04:11.220
of those things are
going to change.

04:04:11.220 --> 04:04:13.470
It's going to need
a powerful movement,

04:04:13.470 --> 04:04:16.660
and I think we learned
this from history,

04:04:16.660 --> 04:04:19.070
and we learned this
from today, right.

04:04:19.070 --> 04:04:21.700
And so that, that
movement is happening.

04:04:21.700 --> 04:04:26.310
And so we, we've been traveling
around the country and kind

04:04:26.310 --> 04:04:28.190
of uniting and organizing folks.

04:04:28.190 --> 04:04:31.800
And, and I, I have been
particularly inspired by this,

04:04:31.800 --> 04:04:37.850
this one quote from Dr. King,
from the Massy Lectures in '67

04:04:37.850 --> 04:04:41.380
when he kind of was calling for
and putting out some of the,

04:04:41.380 --> 04:04:44.160
the ideas of the Poor
People's Campaign.

04:04:44.160 --> 04:04:46.990
And he says, there is nothing
wrong with a traffic light

04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:50.090
which says that you have
to stop for a red light,

04:04:50.090 --> 04:04:53.490
but when a fire is raging,
the fire truck goes right

04:04:53.490 --> 04:04:54.940
through that red light,

04:04:54.940 --> 04:04:58.490
and normal traffic had
better get out of its way.

04:04:58.490 --> 04:05:03.220
Or when a man is bleeding
to death, the ambulance goes

04:05:03.220 --> 04:05:07.090
through those red
lights at top speed.

04:05:07.090 --> 04:05:11.960
There is a fire raging now
for the poor of this society.

04:05:11.960 --> 04:05:13.810
They are living in
tragic conditions

04:05:13.810 --> 04:05:16.090
because the terrible
economic injustices

04:05:16.090 --> 04:05:19.140
that keep them locked in.

04:05:19.140 --> 04:05:23.360
Disinherited people all over
the world are bleeding to death

04:05:23.360 --> 04:05:26.490
from deep social
and economic wounds.

04:05:26.490 --> 04:05:30.070
They need for gabs of
ambulance drivers who will have

04:05:30.070 --> 04:05:33.430
to ignore the red light
of the present system

04:05:33.430 --> 04:05:36.390
until the emergency is solved.

04:05:36.390 --> 04:05:40.530
Massive civil disobedience is
a strategy for social change,

04:05:40.530 --> 04:05:43.880
which is at least as
forceful as an ambulance

04:05:43.880 --> 04:05:46.270
with its sirens on full.

04:05:46.270 --> 04:05:50.550
And so what we have all across
the country is thousands

04:05:50.550 --> 04:05:54.810
of ambulance drivers, thousands
of people who have signed

04:05:54.810 --> 04:05:58.770
up to say that they will
ignore the red lights of racism

04:05:58.770 --> 04:06:02.210
and sexism and poverty
and militarism

04:06:02.210 --> 04:06:06.040
and ecological devastation
and that they will,

04:06:06.040 --> 04:06:10.670
they will continue to do this
until the emergency is solved.

04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:16.020
And that you know, to, to go
back and think about the role

04:06:16.020 --> 04:06:19.350
that nonviolent civil
disobedience has in history,

04:06:19.350 --> 04:06:23.460
the role of poor people
coming together and, and,

04:06:23.460 --> 04:06:29.230
and disrupting and calling
to account the structures

04:06:29.230 --> 04:06:31.770
that are impoverishing,
the structures

04:06:31.770 --> 04:06:40.940
that are killing people
and, and to say not today.

04:06:40.940 --> 04:06:43.970
Not on our watch.

04:06:43.970 --> 04:06:50.040
And in such a time as this
we are called indeed to,

04:06:50.040 --> 04:06:54.810
to organize, we are called
to mobilize, we are called

04:06:54.810 --> 04:06:59.020
to educate, we are called to
celebrate, and we are called to,

04:06:59.020 --> 04:07:01.710
to build a powerful movement.

04:07:01.710 --> 04:07:07.000
And so we invite everybody
to be a part of this.

04:07:07.000 --> 04:07:09.830
We need everyone.

04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:11.740
Especially the people that are.

04:07:11.740 --> 04:07:16.230
And all roads at this point,
because we're on week five,

04:07:16.230 --> 04:07:21.920
lead to week six, and lead to
June 23rd where at 7th Street

04:07:21.920 --> 04:07:26.850
on the National Mall at
that pebble gravel area,

04:07:26.850 --> 04:07:31.510
you know where it is, we will
have an encampment that goes

04:07:31.510 --> 04:07:36.040
up on, on Sunday, and we
will have cultural events,

04:07:36.040 --> 04:07:39.340
educational events, rallies
and actions happening all week.

04:07:39.340 --> 04:07:43.330
And then on Saturday the
23rd we'll have a mass call

04:07:43.330 --> 04:07:44.890
to action rally.

04:07:44.890 --> 04:07:46.950
And, and we -- people from all

04:07:46.950 --> 04:07:49.720
across the country are
coming, and we need everyone.

04:07:49.720 --> 04:07:52.510
So, so please join us.

04:07:52.510 --> 04:08:06.100
