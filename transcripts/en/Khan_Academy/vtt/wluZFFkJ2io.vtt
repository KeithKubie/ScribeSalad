00:00:00.098 --> 00:00:04.316
In the last video, we covered the basics
of what an Adjustable Rate Mortgage is and

00:00:04.442 --> 00:00:06.886
how it's different from a Fixed Rate
Mortgage.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.318
But you may have heard another term that
seems to be a mixture of the two!

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:20.355
And that is a Hybrid "ARM" or
Hybrid Adjustable Rate Mortgage.

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:24.797
And a 'Hybrid', when we use the word
generally, means a mix of things.

00:00:24.797 --> 00:00:27.291
And that's exactly what a 'Hybrid ARM' is:

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:32.997
It's a 'mix' of Fixed 
(it's a mix, it's a mix)

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:41.335
of Fixed &amp; Adjustable, and an Adjustable 
Rate Mortgage.

00:00:41.335 --> 00:00:45.745
So what do we mean by "mix of a Fixed and
Adjustable Rate Mortgage"?

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.149
Well, you might hear something like a,

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.839
5-1, a 5-1 Hybrid ARM.

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:59.319
What does that mean?

00:00:59.319 --> 00:01:03.800
Well that means that the first 5 years of
a Mortgage, it behaves like a

00:01:03.932 --> 00:01:08.067
Fixed Mortgage, and then after that it 
becomes Adjustable.

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:12.665
So in the case that we used in the video
on Adjustable Rate Mortgages, we saw

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.050
that as your benchmark one year
treasury rate fluctuates, that every year

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:22.183
your Adjustable Rate Mortgage resets.
And if interest rates go high enough, it

00:01:22.183 --> 00:01:24.898
might become unfavorable relative
to the Fixed Rate.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:27.665
And this was just for the scenario that
we were looking at.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:32.434
Well, in the 5-1 Hybrid ARM, what happened
is that the first 5 years,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.821
it's a Fixed Rate Mortgage,

00:01:38.774 --> 00:01:44.818
and then after that it adjusts, it adjusts
as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

00:01:44.818 --> 00:01:48.917
So the first 5 years, it's a Fixed Rate 
Mortgage, and then after that it adjusts

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:52.204
just like an Adjustable Rate.
And if it has the same properties as the

00:01:52.204 --> 00:01:55.842
Adjustable Rate that we saw in the video 
on Adjustable Rate Mortgages,

00:01:55.842 --> 00:01:57.727
then we start adjusting.

00:01:57.727 --> 00:02:01.077
So that's for that year, and then the 
year after that, maybe this year

00:02:01.077 --> 00:02:05.830
interest rates have gone down a little bit
so we pay a premium over the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.840
treasury...
So we start adjusting.

00:02:08.323 --> 00:02:11.813
So question is, why would someone want 
to do this?

00:02:11.864 --> 00:02:16.167
One, why would a borrower want to do this?
And then, why does a bank do it?

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:19.864
When we talked about Adjustable Rate
Mortgages, we talked about this idea of

00:02:19.864 --> 00:02:20.979
interest rate risk,

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:24.744
that in an Adjustable Rate Mortgage, a
borrower takes on the interest rate risk.

00:02:24.744 --> 00:02:29.114
If interest rates go up, the borrower
will have to pay more interest

00:02:29.114 --> 00:02:31.157
but the lender is protected.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:34.079
On the other hand, for a Fixed Rate, if
interest rates go up,

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.034
it's the lender who has to take on that
risk, while the borrower is protected.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:44.698
While with a Hybrid, it's in-between. The
first 5 years, the borrower is protected.

00:02:44.708 --> 00:02:48.731
They know that "Hey look! I know what my
payment is going to be for those 5 years,

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:51.434
and then after that, it adjusts."

00:02:51.434 --> 00:02:55.238
And that's also from a lender's point of
view. They're like, "Okay. We'll take on

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:58.852
the interest rate risk for the first 
5 years but then after that, because it

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:03.051
is really hard to predict what interest
rates are going to be doing in 5 or 6 or 7

00:03:03.051 --> 00:03:07.733
or 10 or 15 years, then it floats and the
borrower takes it on."

00:03:07.882 --> 00:03:12.600
It's not even the case that the borrower
initially even has to take on this risk.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.543
It could be the case that the borrower is
buying some type of a property, where they

00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:19.120
think that they will either sell the
property,

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.954
or maybe they'll refinance the property.
But especially

00:03:20.954 --> 00:03:22.409
if they think they're going to
sell the property

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.129
in the next 5 years,
this could make a lot of sense,

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.955
especially if they get a lower rate than
they would've gotten with a Fixed Rate.

00:03:29.085 --> 00:03:32.325
For example, the rate that they might've
gotten might've have looked

00:03:32.325 --> 00:03:33.972
something more like,

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.529
it might've been a lower rate than
the Fixed Rate,

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:41.818
very likely for the same credit risk,
it might've been a lower rate.

00:03:43.143 --> 00:03:50.033
And then after 5 years that's a lower rate
because the bank is taking on less of the

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.061
interest rate risk especially when you go
out or when you go out beyond your 5.

00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:55.905
And then it would adjust.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.814
So the incentive is okay!
If I think I'm going to sell this house

00:04:07.814 --> 00:04:09.602
or refinance this house which means

00:04:09.602 --> 00:04:13.216
take another loan to pay this loan off,
if I think I'm going to be able to do

00:04:13.216 --> 00:04:15.241
either of those things in the
next 5 years,

00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:18.328
maybe it makes a lot 
of sense for me to do this.

00:04:18.723 --> 00:04:22.756
So in a Hybrid, both parties are kind of
mixing - they're both taking different

00:04:22.756 --> 00:04:26.865
pieces of the interest rate risk and
once again, depending on your scenario,

00:04:26.865 --> 00:04:30.274
it might make sense to think about
something like a Hybrid ARM, if you

00:04:30.274 --> 00:04:35.025
feel very confident that you can either
take on the variable risk - the interest

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:39.112
rate risk - that will happen after your 5,
or you think that this property is going

00:04:39.112 --> 00:04:43.325
to be something that you might own or ... 
that you'll only own for the next 5 years,

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:47.031
or that you might refinance in some way,
or maybe you'll be able to pay it off,

00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:49.273
maybe you're expecting an inheritance
in your 4,

00:04:49.273 --> 00:04:51.235
and so you can just pay off the property

00:04:51.235 --> 00:04:53.427
or pay off the loan, 
&amp; you won't have to worry

00:04:53.437 --> 00:04:55.833
about all of this business right over
here.
