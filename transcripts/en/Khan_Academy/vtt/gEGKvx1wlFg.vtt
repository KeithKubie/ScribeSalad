00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.522
- When you first learn
math, you see things like

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:05.239
two plus three

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:08.032
is equal to five,

00:00:08.032 --> 00:00:11.836
or you might see six plus one

00:00:11.836 --> 00:00:15.009
is equal to seven,

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.026
or you might see eight minus two

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:21.658
is equal to six.

00:00:21.658 --> 00:00:25.385
And all of these, you might
think that the equal sign

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:26.718
just says, hey, give me the answer,

00:00:26.718 --> 00:00:28.569
figure out what two plus three is.

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:30.124
Two plus three, well, the answer is five.

00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:31.817
Six plus one, the answer is seven.

00:00:31.817 --> 00:00:34.037
Eight minus two, the answer is six.

00:00:34.037 --> 00:00:36.476
That's not quite right.

00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:39.275
What the equal sign is saying is that

00:00:39.275 --> 00:00:43.683
what's on the left side
is the same amount,

00:00:43.683 --> 00:00:48.056
the same quantity, as what
is on the right-hand side.

00:00:48.056 --> 00:00:52.512
It's saying that two plus three
is the same thing as five.

00:00:52.512 --> 00:00:54.688
And you didn't have to write it this way.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:56.249
You could have written,

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.740
you could have written five
is equal to two plus three.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:04.423
You could write that three plus two

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:07.559
is equal to two plus three.

00:01:07.559 --> 00:01:10.390
Notice, here, we're not
figuring out the answer,

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:13.015
we're just saying that
whatever three plus two is,

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:14.494
that's going to be the same thing

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:16.307
as whatever two plus three is.

00:01:16.307 --> 00:01:19.107
We know that they both equal five.

00:01:19.107 --> 00:01:21.801
You could even mix
addition and subtraction,

00:01:21.801 --> 00:01:24.047
you could write, you could write that

00:01:24.047 --> 00:01:27.594
six plus one is the same thing,

00:01:27.594 --> 00:01:31.914
is equal to, eight minus one.

00:01:31.915 --> 00:01:34.619
They are the same amount,
the same quantity.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.148
What is six plus one, well, that's seven.

00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:41.009
What's eight minus one,
well, that is seven.

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.851
So the equal sign does not mean

00:01:42.851 --> 00:01:44.857
just give me the answer or just, you know,

00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:46.831
add the numbers or subtract the numbers.

00:01:46.831 --> 00:01:51.265
An equal sign is saying that
what's on the left-hand side

00:01:51.265 --> 00:01:55.429
is the same amount as what's
on the right-hand side.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:58.742
So with that in our brain,
let's write some statements

00:01:58.742 --> 00:02:02.434
using equal signs, some
equations, you could even say,

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:04.207
using equal signs, and figure out

00:02:04.207 --> 00:02:07.237
which of them are actually true.

00:02:07.237 --> 00:02:11.918
So if I were to write down,
if I were to write down,

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:13.899
I won't even read it out,
'cause it might give it away.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:18.041
If I were to write down
this, is this true?

00:02:19.348 --> 00:02:23.264
Well, the number on the left here is 18,

00:02:23.264 --> 00:02:26.032
the number on the left is
18, the number on the right

00:02:26.032 --> 00:02:29.848
is a different number, it is 81, it is 81.

00:02:29.848 --> 00:02:31.599
They swapped, or we swapped (chuckles),

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.423
the one and the eight,
they're in different places.

00:02:34.423 --> 00:02:36.035
This is a different number, this is 81.

00:02:36.035 --> 00:02:38.077
These are not equal.

00:02:38.077 --> 00:02:41.693
These are not, not equal.

00:02:41.693 --> 00:02:43.781
So this statement is not true.

00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:45.709
And sometimes you might
even see someone do

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.768
something like this, that means not equal.

00:02:47.768 --> 00:02:51.009
18 is not equal to 81.

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:52.843
Let's keep going.

00:02:52.843 --> 00:02:54.531
What if I were to write,

00:02:54.532 --> 00:02:58.999
what if I were to write nine minus three

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:02.671
plus two minus zero

00:03:02.671 --> 00:03:07.131
is equal to, is equal to...

00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:11.269
zero plus one minus one

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.306
plus eight, is this true?

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:19.997
Well, let's figure out
what the left-hand side is.

00:03:19.997 --> 00:03:21.861
See, nine minus three is six,

00:03:21.861 --> 00:03:25.688
plus two is eight, minus zero is eight.

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:29.159
So this, this, if I were to, if I were

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:31.843
to compute it, that's equal to eight.

00:03:31.843 --> 00:03:34.684
And then on the right-hand
side I have zero plus one

00:03:34.684 --> 00:03:37.593
minus one, well, one minus one is zero,

00:03:37.593 --> 00:03:40.122
so this is all going to be eight.

00:03:40.122 --> 00:03:44.228
So this is, this is
true, eight equals eight.

00:03:44.228 --> 00:03:46.223
This is another way of writing eight,

00:03:46.223 --> 00:03:50.172
nine minus three plus two
minus zero, this is eight.

00:03:50.172 --> 00:03:52.579
And this is also eight, so once again

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.630
the equal sign is just saying that this,

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.370
what we have on the left, is the same

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.044
as what we have on the right.

00:03:58.044 --> 00:04:00.549
Let's do another example.

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.291
Let's do another example,
let's do two more examples.

00:04:03.291 --> 00:04:07.101
If I were to write this,

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:08.575
is this true?

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.402
Well, you might be tempted, hey, if I put

00:04:11.402 --> 00:04:12.565
a one (chuckles) and a zero together,

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.680
it's gonna look like a 10,
but that's not, this is not

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.511
how we do mathematics, this
is not how we add things.

00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:21.180
One plus zero is just one, so
this would be the same thing

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.059
as saying that 10 is equal
to one, which we know

00:04:24.059 --> 00:04:28.866
is not true, so this is not
equal, this is not equal.

00:04:28.866 --> 00:04:30.699
Let's do one more.

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:34.090
Let's say I had seven plus one

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:38.695
is equal to three plus four.

00:04:38.696 --> 00:04:41.690
Is this equation true?

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:43.029
Well, what do we have on the left,

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.171
seven plus one is eight,
three plus four is seven.

00:04:46.171 --> 00:04:48.480
These are not the same
quantity, they're not

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.996
the same amount, so these are not equal.

00:04:52.996 --> 00:04:54.816
And we're done.
