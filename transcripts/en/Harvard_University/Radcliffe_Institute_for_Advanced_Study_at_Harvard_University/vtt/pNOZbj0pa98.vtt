00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.375
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.350
- Good afternoon, everybody.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:09.190
I'm Jane Kamensky.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:11.520
I'm the Pforzheimer
Foundation director

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.200
of the Schlesinger
Library, which

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.170
is a very lucky thing to be.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.090
And my job this
afternoon is to be

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.610
the introducer of
the introducer,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.090
to welcome you on
behalf of Schlesinger,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.030
one of Radcliffe's core
program and the Radcliffe

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.030
Institute for Advanced Studies.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.210
Schlesinger Library
arranged this program,

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.590
which Nancy Weiss Malkiel
was kind enough to assent to.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.090
And it follows the direction of
all of our public programming,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.480
which raises crucial
questions about women gender,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.260
sexuality in the history and
structure of American society,

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.450
thus furthering one of Radcliffe
Institute's core missions

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.730
and exposing the field-defining
and field-defying work

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.810
that people do in Schlesinger
Library collections.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.350
You'll find that Nancy Weiss
Malkiel's towering book, Keep

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.610
the Damned Women Out,
does all of those things.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.450
Often the work that comes
out of the sorts of research

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.060
we feature is unfinished work.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
And I think that's
represented by the fact

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.370
that today's talk
is called Still

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.880
Struggling Toward Coeducation.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.670
In a weird quirk
of timing, we're

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.840
up against the Harvard
FAS faculty meeting, which

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.190
is right now discussing the
fate of single-gender, typically

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.330
all-male social organizations
adjacent to and imbricated

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.410
with our campus in 2017.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.650
The next major Schlesinger
Library-sponsored program--

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.750
there is a beautifully
designed postcard

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.110
at the back of the room.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.750
It's called Hidden
in Plain Sight:

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.300
Family Secrets and American
History, in mid-November,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.820
November 17.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.710
And I also want to
call your attention

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.660
to one of Radcliffe's
many events

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.860
that may be of particular
interest to today's audience.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.150
On Thursday, November 2
at 4:15, the Institute

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.020
will welcome the distinguished
historian of American politics

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.230
and social movements, Michael
Kazin, to give a lecture

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.050
entitled Does the
Left Have a Future?,

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.870
a question to which we
badly need an answer--

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.300
an affirmative answer.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.020
The order of business this
evening will be as follows.

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.090
Radcliffe's dean,
Lizabeth Cohen,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.790
will properly
introduce our speaker.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.250
Then professor Malkiel
will give her talk,

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.520
followed by a question
and answer period.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.740
And then after that,
you're all invited

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.010
to join her and continue the
conversation in a reception

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.910
right here in the back of the
room at the Knafel Center.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.270
And with that, I will turn
the mic over to Liz Cohen.

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.580
But one thing first.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.610
Many of you will know from
your email this afternoon,

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.240
but some of you will not,
that President Faust announced

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.340
earlier today Dean
Cohen's decision

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.500
to step down from the Radcliffe
deanship at the end of June.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.290
Programs like this
one are the tip

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.230
of the iceberg of
what Liz has built

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.280
at Radcliffe as an
institute of advanced study

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.400
that honors its origins
in Radcliffe College,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.860
but also transcends
them, and that

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.650
brings the fruits
of advanced study

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.040
to a broad public in
occasions like this one.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.470
We will have many chances to
recognize Liz's work as dean

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.540
publicly in the months ahead.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.750
But I think this is the first,
so I ask that we do so now.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:44.542
Thanks, Liz.

00:03:44.542 --> 00:03:46.952
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.440
- Good afternoon.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.690
Thank you all.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.430
Good afternoon.

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:02.930
And thank you Jane for
that lovely message.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.830
You can imagine this is
a bittersweet moment,

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.200
the first of many.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.960
I'm delighted to have you
all here at the Radcliffe

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.070
Institute.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.630
And I'm especially glad to have
the pleasure of introducing

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.329
an old friend and
a fellow historian,

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.900
Nancy Weiss Malkiel, not
least because the work

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.230
that she is here to discuss
has special relevance

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.930
to Radcliffe and to Harvard.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.400
Today, Radcliffe is an Institute
for Advanced Study, committed

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.510
to rigorous inquiry across
disciplinary boundaries

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:41.930
and to sharing that work through
extensive public programming.

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.480
But we haven't always been an
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.810
As I'm sure that many
if not all of you know,

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.370
today's Radcliffe Institute
began as Radcliffe College.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.070
We honor this legacy regularly.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.390
And that history is
indelibly imprinted on us,

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
despite the enormous
change in our mission.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.700
For one thing, from its earliest
days as the so-called Harvard

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.260
Annex, established
in 1879, Radcliffe

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.940
was dedicated to providing
a Harvard-quality education

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.730
to those who would not
otherwise have had access

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.430
to it, namely women.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.650
Later, when Elizabeth
Cary Agassiz

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.760
founded Radcliffe
College in 1894,

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.790
women were not only
awarded bachelor's degrees

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.750
from Radcliffe,
but PhDs as well.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.200
When many graduate schools
additionally denied entry

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.890
to African-Americans,
Radcliffe opened its doors

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:49.330
to Eva Beatrice Dykes, who was
a graduate student in 1921,

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.730
became the first
African-American woman

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.590
in the country to complete
the requirement to earn a PhD.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.040
In short, when Harvard
kept people out,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.130
Radcliffe welcomed them in.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:05.260
Radcliffe continues
this tradition

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.940
of promoting diversity and
inclusion in a number of ways.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:14.080
Since the arrival in 2001 of
the first group of fellows

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.020
at the new Radcliffe
Institute, women

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.070
have comprised a majority
of every fellowship class,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.730
today consisting of 50
scientists, humanists,

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:27.250
social scientists,
and artists who

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.710
are diverse in many
other ways as well.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:34.060
We also help the university
bring new talent and diversity

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:36.430
to the faculty through the
Radcliffe Professorships

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.910
program, which recruits
tenured and untenured faculty

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.240
to Harvard schools by
offering them the opportunity

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.010
to spend one or two years in
residence as Radcliffe Fellows.

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.470
And our public
programming frequently

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:53.890
examines important
issues related to gender,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:56.680
often exploring how
gender intersects

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.600
with other identities.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.570
For example, our annual
gender conferences

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.490
have focused on such topics as
immigration, violence, sports,

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.600
the Arab Spring, public health,
and coming up this April,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.010
citizenship.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:16.390
We have also organized symposia
on subjects like gender

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.450
and family in the
global refugee crisis,

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:24.640
or women and the lack of them
in the booming biotech sector.

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.330
And of course, one of
Radcliffe's three core programs

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:30.340
is the Schlesinger
Library on the history

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:35.330
of women in America, which Jane
Kamensky is Faculty Director.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:38.080
The Schlesinger's mission
since its founding

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:42.190
75 years ago has been to
collect the papers of women

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.740
and their organizations
to document

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.340
the history of American
women, gender, and society

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.160
for the present
and for the future.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.130
At this moment in its
history, we are particularly

00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:57.730
focused on broadening the
Schlesinger's collections

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:00.430
so that they reflect
the varied experiences

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:02.590
of all American women.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:05.830
As you may know, the Schlesinger
with its rich archives

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:07.900
on the history of
Radcliffe College

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.300
was a critical
resource for Nancy

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.400
in pursuing the work that
you will be discussing

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.630
with us this afternoon.

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:17.420
Today Nancy will help
us better understand

00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:21.230
a critical moment in our
own Radcliffe history, which

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:25.340
she has analyzed so insightfully
in her recent book entitled

00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:29.900
Keep the Damned Women Out: The
Struggle Towards Coeducation.

00:08:29.900 --> 00:08:33.049
That title-- the Keep the
Damned Women Out part--

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:36.080
is a quotation from one
particularly agitated

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.700
Dartmouth alumnus.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.659
And it provides a clue into
the intensity of emotion

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.990
that surrounded this enormous
change in the nation's most

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:47.000
elite colleges--

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.950
private colleges.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.310
Thanks to Nancy's deep
research and engaging writing,

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:56.330
we can listen in on the
complex institutional decision

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.020
making and the internal
and external debates that

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.620
swirled around the question
of coeducation at Harvard

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:08.190
and Radcliffe and also Yale,
Princeton, Dartmouth, Oxford,

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:11.870
Cambridge, and the elite private
women's colleges of Vassar,

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.030
Smith, and Wellesley.

00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.960
At first glance, it might
seem that the bastions

00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:22.040
of male privilege and
prestige that Nancy examines

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:25.700
embrace coeducation
almost overnight.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.220
Indeed, they all
began accepting women

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.910
within just a few years of 1969.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.180
And looking back on all the
other social and political

00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:39.920
changes underway in
the 1960s, coeducation

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.800
could almost seem inevitable.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.590
But focusing in on
that watershed moment

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:50.540
masks that much more protracted
evolution that both preceded

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.010
and followed it.

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:56.720
Similarly, popular memory tends
to focus on public events,

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.020
and in the process misses
the more private debates

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.680
and negotiations that are
critical to large-scale

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.880
institutional changes, like
the introduction of coeducation

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.040
at elite universities.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.070
Nancy makes none
of these mistakes.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:17.300
With the historian's long
view and penetrating gaze,

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.860
she helps us understand that
like all social revolutions,

00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:23.990
the achievement
of women's access

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.840
to privileged male
universities resulted

00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:30.800
from multiple levels of
causation, both persistent,

00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.980
drawn out rumblings and shorter
fuse catalysts and triggers.

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.290
And while some of the
struggles played out in public,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:43.160
other key moments took
place behind closed doors

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.820
and until now were
buried in the archives.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.370
Most importantly, as
the good historian

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.010
she is, Nancy
knows that there is

00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:54.970
no such thing as inevitability.

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.950
As she writes in a
deliberately understated way,

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:00.590
and I quote, "No
matter how powerful

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.850
the influence of the times,
the coming of coeducation

00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.620
was not a smooth, easy,
uncontested process.

00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.640
We at Radcliffe know
that especially well.

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.330
When Elizabeth Cary Agassiz
founded Radcliffe College,

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:20.450
she thought of it
as a stopgap measure

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.780
until Harvard embraced
coeducation, which she expected

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.760
would happen very soon.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.340
It only took a century."

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:32.450
Looking around this room,
I am aware that many of us

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:36.080
personally experienced the
struggle for coeducation

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:39.710
or were part of
early coed classes.

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.750
Whenever I have
discussed Nancy's book

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.700
with contemporaries,
I have heard

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:46.250
versions of the same comment.

00:11:46.250 --> 00:11:48.950
Reading this book
helped me understand

00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:50.840
what I lived through.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.540
That is certainly true for me.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.650
Co-incidentally, Nancy and
I both arrived at Princeton

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:00.440
in the fall of 1969.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.500
I was a member of the first
coeducational freshman

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:05.000
class at Princeton.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.910
And I would go on to
become a history major.

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:10.790
And Nancy was a new
assistant professor

00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:12.770
and the first woman
faculty member

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.390
in the History Department.

00:12:14.390 --> 00:12:18.050
She may not remember
this, but I recall first

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.920
meeting her at a party at
Professor Carl Schorske's

00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:22.850
house.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:25.670
He and his wife Liz were
newcomers themselves

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.160
to Princeton,
having arrived from

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.080
the great and coeducational
public university of UC

00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080
Berkeley.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:35.360
And they were
determined to help make

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.200
Princeton a more comfortable
place for both sexes.

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.420
Hence, they reached
out to welcome

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.970
women, both students
and faculty,

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:48.750
into their home, a pleasurable
experience for me as a student,

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:50.750
and I would venture
for Nancy too

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:54.260
as one of the very few women
on the Princeton faculty.

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.020
From her first appointment
in the History Department,

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.840
Nancy went on to rise
through the academic ranks

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.420
at Princeton, eventually
serving as dean

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:06.620
of the college for a
remarkable 24 years.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:11.000
It was particularly exciting
for me to watch Nancy as dean

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.790
when my own daughter
Julia was an undergraduate

00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:16.250
in the class of 2009.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:19.760
By then, Princeton had
become a much more normal

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.040
coeducational
environment, thanks

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.360
in great part to Nancy's
commitment and contributions.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.580
As an accomplished
university administrator

00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.210
and a distinguished historian
of 20th Century America,

00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:36.020
Nancy was uniquely
qualified to write this book

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.960
and to guide readers
through a complex history

00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:41.150
of institutional change.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.200
Nonetheless, it took tremendous
courage and determination

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:48.680
to apply every arrow in
the historian's quiver

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.950
to analyzing deeply
and subtly a world

00:13:51.950 --> 00:13:56.510
she knew well as a player,
but not as a scholar.

00:13:56.510 --> 00:13:59.630
Nancy is currently professor
emeritus in Princeton's History

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.620
Department and the author
of several important books.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.450
Keep the Damned Women Out
was published last year.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.450
And it has received
critical acclaim,

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:13.460
including the 2017 PROSE
Award in education practice

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:16.310
from the Association
of American Publishers.

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:18.980
Before that, Nancy
was the author

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:22.610
of Whitney M. Young, Jr., and
the Struggle for Civil Rights,

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.560
Farewell to the
Party of Lincoln:

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.290
Black Politics in
the Age of FDR,

00:14:27.290 --> 00:14:30.620
and The National Urban
League, 1910 to 1940.

00:14:30.620 --> 00:14:32.690
It is a tremendous
pleasure for me

00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:34.740
to have Nancy here
with us today.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:37.050
Please join me in welcoming
her to the podium.

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:39.525
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:41.505 --> 00:14:42.495
- You're terrific.

00:14:42.495 --> 00:14:44.475
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:52.640
I am so honored to be here.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.150
I should really just
sit down after Liz's

00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:58.910
remarkable introduction.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:03.980
She's told you
plenty about my book.

00:15:03.980 --> 00:15:06.890
One of the reasons
I'm amazed to be here

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:11.240
is that I studied American
History at Harvard

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:20.030
in the era of Buck, Hanlon,
[INAUDIBLE],, Friedel, Fleming,

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.320
May.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:28.250
And American History at Harvard
today, Faust, Cohen, Kamensky,

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.080
Cott, Ulrich, McGirr,
Higginbotham, and I've

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:35.270
left out a whole bunch of them.

00:15:35.270 --> 00:15:40.250
I could never for a
moment have imagined what

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:45.380
a transformation has occurred.

00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.560
I have three objectives
this afternoon.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.280
The first is to examine
the flood of decisions

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.390
for coeducation at highly
prestigious colleges

00:15:56.390 --> 00:15:59.000
and universities in
the United States

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.530
and the United Kingdom in
the period 1969 to '74.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:09.050
The second is to locate Harvard
and Radcliffe in that context.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:11.870
And the third is to
make some observations

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:14.960
about the relationship
of coeducation

00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.630
to the significant
challenges that

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.980
remain in terms of
the education of women

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:24.890
and the barriers women
continue to face,

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:28.910
not only in higher education,
but in the professions

00:16:28.910 --> 00:16:30.970
and public life.

00:16:30.970 --> 00:16:35.030
I'll begin then with the
decisions for coeducation

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:40.120
in the period 1969 to 1974.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.420
Coeducation came all of a
sudden to very traditional,

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:48.350
very conservative,
very elite, very old

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:53.630
colleges and universities like
Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth.

00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:58.460
It came to men's colleges
at Cambridge and Oxford.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:03.140
And it came to dozens of other
colleges and universities

00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.700
as well.

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:06.530
Well why did this happen?

00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.849
And why then?

00:17:07.849 --> 00:17:10.849
What hurdles had to
be overcome to open

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:16.430
the doors of highly prestigious
institutions to women?

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:21.180
And how well did coeducation
work in its early years?

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.319
Coeducation happened
in the United States

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:27.230
because it was in
the strategic self

00:17:27.230 --> 00:17:31.370
interest of all-male
institutions like Princeton

00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:34.670
and Yale to admit women.

00:17:34.670 --> 00:17:37.460
By the late 1960s,
these schools were

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:41.600
beginning to see their
applications decline along

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.250
with their yields.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:47.870
The high school students these
schools called the best boys

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.310
no longer wanted to go
to all-male institutions.

00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:55.850
So the key issue was
the ability to continue

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:59.240
to attract those best boys.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.040
And this is, by the
way, when Harvard

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.760
begins to pull away
from Yale and Princeton

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.860
in the competition for the
best high school students.

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:10.250
I hadn't realized that.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.590
I thought Harvard
was always ahead.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:14.300
But it wasn't true.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:18.020
Up till the early 1960s,
the three went head-to-head.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.990
And Harvard, with
Radcliffe up the street,

00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:25.040
had something that these best
high school boys wanted, which

00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:29.060
is to say proximity to women.

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:33.890
So coeducation became the
means for places like Princeton

00:18:33.890 --> 00:18:38.210
and Yale to shore up a
first-rate applicant pool

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:40.800
and enrolled student body.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:44.450
It was not the result of a
high-minded moral commitment

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.990
to opening educational
opportunities to women.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.740
It was not a matter of a
mission to educate women.

00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.540
It was not the result
of deep thinking

00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.450
about how to educate women.

00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:58.580
Rather, it was about
what women would

00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:02.570
do for previously
all-male institutions,

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.180
about how women would
help these schools renew

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.010
their hold on the best boys.

00:19:08.010 --> 00:19:11.570
Women, in other words,
played the instrumental role

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:16.880
of improving the educational
experience of men.

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.990
While my story this afternoon
focuses on the United States,

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:24.260
I might note
parenthetically that you

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:28.430
see a variant of strategic
self interest at Cambridge

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:32.600
and Oxford, where the decision
by particular colleges

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.770
to take the lead in going
mixed was prompted in part

00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:39.590
by a desire to get
better students

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:44.300
and increase their prestige
relative to the other colleges

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.570
in the two universities.

00:19:47.570 --> 00:19:49.220
Returning to the
United States, I

00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:52.670
want to point out that the
protagonists in this story

00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:53.810
are men.

00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:57.500
Save for Polly Bunting,
the extraordinary president

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:01.580
of Radcliffe, every strategist,
every decision maker,

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.450
everyone leading the charge
for coeducation was male.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:10.400
Coeducation resulted not
from organized efforts

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.350
by women activists, but
from strategic decisions

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:19.410
taken by powerful men.

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:22.580
Why did coeducation
happen when it did?

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:25.760
Changes in application
patterns were a trigger,

00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:30.260
but the larger context of
the 1960s set the stage.

00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:34.130
The civil rights movement,
the antiwar movements,

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:37.070
student movement,
the women's movement.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:40.740
By the end of the 1960s,
colleges and universities

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.890
looked quite different
than they had

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:45.260
in the beginning of the decade.

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:47.000
The composition
of student bodies

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.290
began to change to include a
larger number of public school

00:20:51.290 --> 00:20:54.920
students, students from
less advantaged families,

00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:57.470
Catholic students,
Jewish students, even

00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:59.900
some African Americans.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.040
So in a way, admitting
women followed logically.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.110
As well, men and women students
in the 1960s demonstrated

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:13.100
together, protested together,
registered black voters

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.120
together.

00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:18.500
Not going to school together
seemed increasingly outmoded.

00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.180
And all of this,
of course, bears

00:21:20.180 --> 00:21:23.480
on why high school students
changed their minds

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.020
about the attractiveness
of all-male schools.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:31.550
Princeton and Yale were the
prime movers in this process.

00:21:31.550 --> 00:21:36.420
Everyone else was watching
and taking cues from them.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:40.130
They were driven by the
forces I've just described,

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:42.440
especially admissions.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:46.190
But they were also acting
in direct competition

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:47.180
with one another.

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:48.710
And you don't have
to infer that.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:53.170
It's right there in
the archival materials.

00:21:53.170 --> 00:21:55.760
Let me make just a
few comments about how

00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:58.010
that competition worked.

00:21:58.010 --> 00:22:00.650
Kingman Brewster started it off.

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:05.260
He, in December
of 1966, announced

00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.390
with Alan Simpson, the
president of Vassar College,

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:10.850
that the two
institutions would engage

00:22:10.850 --> 00:22:14.450
in a serious study of the
possibility of moving Vassar

00:22:14.450 --> 00:22:17.810
from Poughkeepsie to New Haven.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:22.730
And that study unfolded
over the next 11 months.

00:22:22.730 --> 00:22:27.710
President, trustees,
administrators, faculty, alums,

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:33.870
students all engaged
in one way or another.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.930
So when Bob Goheen at Princeton
found out that Brewster was,

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:42.140
if you will, courting
Vassar, his first response

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:44.210
was to go up to Sarah
Lawrence College

00:22:44.210 --> 00:22:47.330
to talk to Esther Raushenbush,
the president of Sarah

00:22:47.330 --> 00:22:51.440
Lawrence, about the possibility
of Sarah Lawrence and Princeton

00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.480
engaging in a similar
study of moving

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.105
Sarah Lawrence to
Princeton, an unlikelier

00:22:56.105 --> 00:23:01.060
match I can't imagine.

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:04.960
Bob Goheen's more serious
response to Vassar-Yale

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.880
was to ask the trustees
for authorization

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.140
to undertake a serious
data-driven analytic study

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:15.410
of the desirability and
feasibility of coeducation

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:16.670
for Princeton.

00:23:16.670 --> 00:23:19.160
And he asked Gardner
Patterson, an economist

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.830
on the faculty of the
Woodrow Wilson School,

00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:24.290
to carry the study forward.

00:23:24.290 --> 00:23:29.870
And that work began
in the summer of 1967

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:35.960
and continued through
the summer of 1968.

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.120
Well, after Vassar
said no to Yale,

00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.850
Kingman Brewster said,
well, maybe we'll

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:44.060
establish our own women's
college, a coordinate women's

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:44.840
college.

00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:49.430
And he spent most of
the next 10 months

00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:54.440
or so musing in a desultory
sort of way about what

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.420
that college for women might
involve, but not much happened.

00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:02.930
Then in September of
1968, the Patterson Report

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.630
was published in the
Princeton Alumni Weekly

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:09.470
and widely distributed, and
a copy arrived in New Haven.

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:11.570
And Brewster read
it, and he realized

00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:16.430
that Princeton might actually
be serious about coeducation.

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:20.930
And within two months, Brewster
got the Yale corporation

00:24:20.930 --> 00:24:25.100
and the Yale faculty to
vote in favor of coeducation

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:27.390
for September 1969.

00:24:27.390 --> 00:24:30.050
There was no process
and no planning.

00:24:30.050 --> 00:24:33.050
And it was a direct
response to the possibility

00:24:33.050 --> 00:24:36.800
that Princeton might
get there first.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.010
So at the point when the Yale
folks vote for coeducation,

00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:48.110
Princeton is engaged in careful,
deliberate, consultative

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:51.320
process discussing the--

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:54.830
first they had a trustee
committee evaluating

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:55.920
the Patterson Report.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.860
Then they discussed
it with alumni

00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:00.950
around the country
in regional meetings.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:05.150
The Princeton trustees took
their first vote on coeducation

00:25:05.150 --> 00:25:09.620
in January of 1969 as Yale
was reading applications

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:10.700
from women students.

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:14.450
And they agreed in principle
to support coeducation

00:25:14.450 --> 00:25:16.790
and told Goheen to come
back when he was ready,

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.830
tell them how he would do it.

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:23.720
So he comes back in
late April of 1969

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:28.760
and explains how
Princeton would do it.

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.710
Now understand Yale
has already admitted

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:33.830
its first class of women.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:36.530
If this had been done Princeton
style, what the Princeton

00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:41.380
trustees would have decided
in late April of 1969

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:44.360
was that coeducation would
come in the fall of 1970.

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:47.030
Lots of time for
planning and getting

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:49.070
organized, but that
wasn't possible.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:52.290
Women were coming to
Yale in the fall of 1969.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:56.210
And so they were coming
to Princeton in September

00:25:56.210 --> 00:26:00.560
after a decision in late April.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.840
Let me turn now to
the hurdles that

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:07.670
had to be overcome to open the
doors of these institutions

00:26:07.670 --> 00:26:09.000
to women.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.610
No matter which institution
we're talking about,

00:26:11.610 --> 00:26:14.360
it would be difficult to
overestimate how tough it

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.840
was to make coeducation happen.

00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:20.760
There was fierce
opposition from alumni,

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.940
as well as
significant resistance

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.910
from many faculty and students.

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:29.040
Some examples
illustrate the point.

00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.170
Liz has already commented
on the title of my book,

00:26:33.170 --> 00:26:34.970
Keep the Damned Women Out.

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.430
The letter from the
Dartmouth alumnus class

00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:43.790
of 1929 to the chair of the
Dartmouth trustees in 1970

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:47.600
said, for God's sake,
for Dartmouth's sake,

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:52.760
and for everyone's sake,
keep the damned women out.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.050
Consider an example from Yale
when the Yale corporation first

00:26:57.050 --> 00:27:00.890
opined publicly on the education
of undergraduate women,

00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:04.290
one alumnus responded this way.

00:27:04.290 --> 00:27:06.320
There was a glory to tradition.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:09.460
I think of the girl-filled
weekend, the cocktail party,

00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.925
the dances, the plays,
the big football games.

00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:14.675
Then there was the
adventure of journeying

00:27:14.675 --> 00:27:17.090
to the girls colleges.

00:27:17.090 --> 00:27:19.730
And gentlemen, he
said, let's face it.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:23.040
Charming as women are,
they get to be a drag

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.320
if you are forced to associate
with them each and every day.

00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:31.220
Think of the poor student
who has a steady date.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.460
He wants to concentrate
on the basic principles

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:37.940
of thermodynamics, but
she keeps trying to gossip

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:44.660
about all the idiotic trivia
all women try to impose on men.

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.350
Consider some examples
from Princeton.

00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:49.395
One alumnus wondered
why this death

00:27:49.395 --> 00:27:52.550
wish on the part of Princeton.

00:27:52.550 --> 00:27:56.480
If women were admitted, he said
no doubt a very fine school

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.960
would emerge, but
Princeton University

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.520
would be lost forever.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:04.790
Another alumnus said
that coeducation

00:28:04.790 --> 00:28:09.440
would dilute Princeton's sturdy
masculinity with disconcerting

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:12.860
mini-skirted young things
cavorting on its playing

00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:14.270
fields.

00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:16.820
So another alumnus
put it this way.

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.560
What is all this nonsense about
admitting women to Princeton?

00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:24.350
The good, old-fashioned
whorehouse

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:28.460
would be considerably more
efficient and much, much

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:30.710
cheaper.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:33.330
As for faculty, some
were supportive.

00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:34.310
Some were opposed.

00:28:34.310 --> 00:28:38.270
But virtually everyone put the
newly admitted women students

00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:41.670
on the spot by asking for
the woman's point of view,

00:28:41.670 --> 00:28:45.710
no matter whether the course
was in literature or psychology

00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:48.650
where such a view might
have been relevant,

00:28:48.650 --> 00:28:52.940
or in math or physics
where it surely wasn't.

00:28:52.940 --> 00:28:57.200
I would put that in the category
of bumbling but relatively

00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:00.530
innocent faculty behavior.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:04.640
But not all faculty behavior
could be described that way.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.760
Consider the art history
professor at Dartmouth

00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:12.320
who posted slides of nudes on
the screen, running his hand up

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.100
and down their thighs, or the
oceanography professor who

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:20.120
showed pictures of sea
creatures, shrimp, lobster,

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:23.220
squid, and naked women.

00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.990
Or consider the response of the
chair of the History Department

00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:29.870
at Yale, asked by
a woman freshman

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:35.150
if the department might offer
a course in women's history.

00:29:35.150 --> 00:29:39.980
That, he said, would be like
teaching the history of dogs.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.290
Students were not
always much better

00:29:42.290 --> 00:29:45.980
about welcoming their
female classmates.

00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:49.160
Male students often told
their female counterparts

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.870
that they really didn't
belong on their campuses

00:29:51.870 --> 00:29:54.680
and they should go back
wherever they came from.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:57.410
Dartmouth offers the
most striking examples

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.210
of bad behavior.

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:03.940
Dartmouth men hung banners from
dormitory windows, no coeds,

00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:05.750
coeds go home.

00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:10.310
They shouted out numbers meant
as ratings of attractiveness

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:13.010
as women entered the dining
hall, as if they were

00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:16.440
rating the quality of a dive.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.830
Fraternities delighted
in and got away

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:22.190
with drunken, degrading,
dangerous behaviors

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:26.300
and scurrilous verbal
assaults on women students.

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:29.570
My favorite Dartmouth example
comes from the third year

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.000
of coeducation.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.350
Dartmouth then-- who
knows, maybe now--

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.050
had a tradition, an
event in the spring

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.410
called Hums, which
was a competition

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:43.880
among the fraternities, who
composed and then performed

00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:46.580
original songs.

00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:52.400
And this year the winning
entry in that Hums competition

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:56.310
was the song Our
Co-Hogs, 10 verses

00:30:56.310 --> 00:31:01.400
of outrageously insulting
sexualized attacks on women.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:07.400
Co-hog was a highly derogatory
nickname for women students.

00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:11.360
And the judge of the competition
was the dean of the college.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.040
And he delighted not only
in calling Our Co-Hogs

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.800
the very best
submission of the year,

00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:21.950
but he then stood up with
the members of the fraternity

00:31:21.950 --> 00:31:25.890
in an exuberant public
rendition of the song.

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:28.595
He then left to become
president of a women's college.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.290
Moving next to my second
major theme for the afternoon.

00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:40.340
What can we say about
Harvard and Radcliffe

00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:46.960
in the context of the cascade
of decisions for coeducation?

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.000
And I can't fail to
comment in this setting

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:54.320
on the critical role of
the Schlesinger Library

00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:57.770
in enabling the
telling of this story

00:31:57.770 --> 00:32:02.390
by allowing me to circumvent
the constraints of Harvard's

00:32:02.390 --> 00:32:07.010
50-year rule on access
to institutional records,

00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:09.860
like the papers of the
president, the corporation,

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:10.670
and so on.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:13.020
It's all in the Schlesinger.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:13.520
And-

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:21.800
At any rate, so back to my
subject with a disclaimer.

00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:25.040
To say that I am diffident
about telling a distinguished

00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:29.630
Radcliffe audience what I
make of Radcliffe's history

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.460
is a significant understatement.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.150
But that's what
I've signed on for.

00:32:35.150 --> 00:32:40.670
You will surely have noticed
how rarely I spoke of Harvard

00:32:40.670 --> 00:32:44.030
in the story I just recounted.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:46.070
By all rights, in
my view, Harvard

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:49.280
would have been the
logical first mover

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:51.840
in the coming of coeducation.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.190
As this Radcliffe
audience knows very well,

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.810
Radcliffe was a half mile
up the street from Harvard

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.150
with students whose
academic qualifications

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:05.030
fully matched if
not over matched

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:08.070
those of Harvard students.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:13.310
Radcliffe women had been
taking classes with Harvard men

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:15.080
since the 1940s.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:18.710
The colleges had merged most
of their extracurricular

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.290
activities in the 1950s.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:25.460
The presidents of both
institutions were enthusiastic.

00:33:25.460 --> 00:33:28.220
But realizing
coeducation in Cambridge

00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:33.060
turned out to be a surprisingly
complicated endeavor.

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:36.360
Polly Bunting and
Nathan Pusey began

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:39.870
talking about coeducation
almost from the moment

00:33:39.870 --> 00:33:42.990
that Bunting took up the
presidency of Radcliffe

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:45.340
in 1960.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:49.380
It was clear to her that in
terms of the overall richness

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.370
and effectiveness of
undergraduate education,

00:33:53.370 --> 00:33:56.940
Radcliffe women were at a
significant disadvantage

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:00.030
in comparison with Harvard men.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:02.280
That was evident in every way--

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:06.090
in residential life, in
relations with faculty members,

00:34:06.090 --> 00:34:10.409
in access to resources,
in facilities.

00:34:10.409 --> 00:34:12.989
And Bunting's
proposed solution was

00:34:12.989 --> 00:34:15.449
to make Radcliffe
part of Harvard

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.179
with Harvard taking
responsibility

00:34:18.179 --> 00:34:20.969
for undergraduate education.

00:34:20.969 --> 00:34:23.100
Only then, she
thought, would Harvard

00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:26.040
become what she called
a university in which

00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.860
the educational
potentialities of women

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:33.850
are valued and met as
fully as those of men.

00:34:33.850 --> 00:34:35.980
It sounds straightforward.

00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.350
But it was in no way
simple to achieve.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:45.690
Although functional coeducation
would be realized by 1972,

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:49.570
a formal merger between
Harvard and Radcliffe

00:34:49.570 --> 00:34:54.159
would not be
concluded until 1999.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:59.410
Understanding the long,
often tortuous path to merger

00:34:59.410 --> 00:35:02.980
I think requires reckoning
with the deep investment

00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:06.880
of Radcliffe trustees and
alumni and the history

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.550
and prestige of their college.

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:14.110
Relinquishing any part of
that, indeed compromising

00:35:14.110 --> 00:35:17.200
the institution's
fundamental independence,

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.120
was not to be
undertaken lightly.

00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:26.340
A series of steps taken in
the 1960s and early 1970s,

00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:29.820
mainly at Bunting's
initiative but with Pusey's

00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:32.940
full cooperation, brought
Harvard and Radcliffe

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.520
closer together.

00:35:35.520 --> 00:35:37.620
Harvard first began
awarding degrees

00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.830
to Radcliffe's students,
graduate and undergraduate,

00:35:40.830 --> 00:35:43.470
in 1963.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:47.010
In 1966, the Harvard
registrar's office

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.010
took over Radcliffe
undergraduate registration,

00:35:50.010 --> 00:35:52.440
including course
enrollments, maintenance

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:56.850
of academic records, and
issuance of transcripts.

00:35:56.850 --> 00:36:02.640
In 1967, Harvard opened its
undergraduate library, Lamont,

00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:08.350
to Radcliffe women who had
been excluded for decades.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:12.060
With Yale and
Princeton embarking

00:36:12.060 --> 00:36:17.010
on coeducation and Harvard and
Radcliffe students lobbying

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.430
for coeducation, the
Radcliffe governing boards

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:26.040
voted in February of 1969
to initiate discussions

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.430
with Harvard with
[? a view to ?] merging the two

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.350
institutions.

00:36:31.350 --> 00:36:35.790
The Crimson declared
in a banner headline,

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:42.000
Cliffe finally proposes marriage
to 10,000 men of Harvard.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.650
The Harvard Corporation
responded affirmatively.

00:36:46.650 --> 00:36:50.550
"We can say at once,"
Pusey wrote to Bunting,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:54.660
"that in principle we welcome
the prospect of a merger.

00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.150
We should be happy
to join with you

00:36:57.150 --> 00:37:03.260
in discussion of when and how
a merger might be effected."

00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.720
Well, as you well know,
it took another 30 years

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.060
for that to happen.

00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:12.780
What were Pusey and
Bunting able to accomplish?

00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:16.020
And what prevented
them from realizing

00:37:16.020 --> 00:37:19.680
the merger both of them
would have liked to achieve?

00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:24.150
By the time Pusey retired
from the Harvard presidency

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:29.910
in 1971, he had succeeded
in admitting to Harvard,

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.910
to the Graduate School of
Arts and Sciences, women

00:37:32.910 --> 00:37:37.260
who would otherwise have
matriculated for graduate study

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:39.180
at Radcliffe.

00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:43.650
On his watch, Harvard had
begun awarding degrees

00:37:43.650 --> 00:37:45.940
to all Radcliffe students.

00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.630
Radcliffe students
had begun taking part

00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:51.690
in Harvard commencement
ceremonies.

00:37:51.690 --> 00:37:55.620
The separate administrative
boards had been dissolved

00:37:55.620 --> 00:37:59.220
and a joint Harvard-Radcliffe
administrative board

00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.420
established.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.860
And Harvard and Radcliffe had
embarked on the early stages

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.470
of co-residential living.

00:38:07.470 --> 00:38:11.260
In other words, undergraduates
at Harvard and Radcliffe

00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:14.370
studied together in
the same classes,

00:38:14.370 --> 00:38:17.700
had the option of living
in the same dormitories,

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.840
participated in the same
extracurricular activities,

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:25.530
graduated in the same
commencement ceremonies,

00:38:25.530 --> 00:38:29.100
and earned the same
bachelor's degrees.

00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.840
The same accomplishments
could also

00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:34.170
be credited to
Polly Bunting, who

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:38.340
had seen to the creation of
a Radcliffe house system,

00:38:38.340 --> 00:38:41.250
the renovation of
existing dormitories

00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:44.250
and the building of a new
set of residential facilities

00:38:44.250 --> 00:38:48.240
at Currier House, the
integration of faculty

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:51.600
and tutors into
Radcliffe houses,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:54.660
and the building of
Phyllis Library, which

00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:59.760
served Radcliffe women
and also attracted Harvard

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:03.060
men to the Radcliffe quad.

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.990
Moreover, Polly Bunting
had created the Radcliffe

00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:10.560
Institute, later the Bunting
Institute, later later

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:14.190
later the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:19.680
But the Radcliffe Institute
then was a pioneering vehicle

00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:23.490
through which talented
adult women had the time,

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:27.630
opportunity, and
support to engage fully

00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:31.620
in intellectual pursuits
or creative work that would

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:35.080
shape their lives and careers.

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:40.720
But going all the way to
merger eluded Pusey and Bunting

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:44.430
no matter how eager they
were to accomplish it.

00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.890
The remaining anomaly at
Harvard and Radcliffe--

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:51.250
two separate corporate
structures with separate

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:53.890
governing boards,
endowments, budgets,

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.080
and administrative
arrangements--

00:39:56.080 --> 00:40:01.000
had not been addressed
before Pusey left office.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.100
Why was that the case?

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.970
On the Harvard side, the
faculty of Arts and Sciences

00:40:06.970 --> 00:40:11.020
was simply not ready to
take full responsibility

00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:13.670
for Radcliffe students.

00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:16.560
To put it perhaps
more charitably,

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:21.840
to be party to the disappearance
of Radcliffe College.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:26.590
Pusey's own freedom of action
was limited in significant part

00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.100
by Vietnam War-related
turmoil that

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:35.290
rocked the Harvard campus
from late November 1966

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.670
through April 1969.

00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:42.100
Calling in the police
to clear University

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:48.190
Hall in the wake of the
student takeover in April 1969

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:51.940
had been hugely
controversial with damage

00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.060
to Pusey's credibility
in the corporation

00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:58.090
as well as with the faculty.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:41:01.660
It also resulted in the
foreshortening of Pusey's term

00:41:01.660 --> 00:41:08.920
as president, which ended in
June 1971, two years before it

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:13.150
was originally intended
to come to a close.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:15.910
Buffeted by forces
largely external

00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:21.280
to Harvard, unable smoothly to
manage the university amidst

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:26.230
the turmoil that those
forces caused on campus,

00:41:26.230 --> 00:41:29.770
Pusey lost the authority
and the maneuvering room

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:33.550
to lean on the Harvard
faculty to embrace

00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:38.890
the internal rearrangements
required for merger.

00:41:38.890 --> 00:41:41.380
And Bunting, of course, had
no independent authority

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.480
over the Harvard faculty.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.110
So she could not
herself have led them

00:41:47.110 --> 00:41:50.080
to a different conclusion.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:54.190
Moreover, Bunting had
trustees and alumni leaders

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:59.320
who were deeply skeptical of
Harvard, a skepticism well

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:04.210
grounded in the reality
of Harvard's history.

00:42:04.210 --> 00:42:09.910
Since 1948, Harvard had had
one tenured woman faculty

00:42:09.910 --> 00:42:14.410
member who held a tenured
position created specifically

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:15.970
for a woman.

00:42:15.970 --> 00:42:19.780
There were a handful of
women assistant professors,

00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:23.470
but there was no past tenure
from the assistant professor

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:24.310
ranks.

00:42:24.310 --> 00:42:27.490
Harvard had no women
administrators.

00:42:27.490 --> 00:42:31.510
And the number of male
undergraduates at Harvard

00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:35.630
was four times the number
of Radcliffe women.

00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:38.170
So there was reasonable
cause to worry

00:42:38.170 --> 00:42:44.080
about submerging Radcliffe into
a less-than-hospitable male

00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.580
university.

00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:50.800
Becoming part of Harvard without
losing Radcliffe's identity

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:56.410
was beyond the imagination of
many of Radcliffe's leaders.

00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:59.530
And that identity
mattered a lot.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.450
In part it mattered
substantively.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:06.640
Radcliffe leaders worried that
women would be treated poorly

00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.870
by Harvard unless
Radcliffe hung in

00:43:10.870 --> 00:43:15.550
to protect them, to
advocate for them,

00:43:15.550 --> 00:43:19.990
and to see them through to
a successful educational

00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:21.640
experience.

00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.790
In part, and I would
argue in large part,

00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:26.960
it mattered symbolically.

00:43:29.530 --> 00:43:34.380
Radcliffe leaders and
Radcliffe alumni more

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:39.570
generally felt a strong
emotional attachment

00:43:39.570 --> 00:43:42.030
to a storied history.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:44.100
Radcliffe had long
been understood

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.540
to be preeminent among
the Seven Sisters.

00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.020
Going to Radcliffe,
being a Radcliffe alumna

00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:58.200
conveyed a status that mattered
hugely to Radcliffe graduates.

00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:01.590
Long past the point
where Radcliffe actually

00:44:01.590 --> 00:44:06.060
functioned as a college,
the abstract idea

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.500
of Radcliffe College
had a powerful hold

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:15.840
on people who believed in
Radcliffe, who loved Radcliffe,

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:20.910
who were firmly convinced that
Radcliffe stood for something

00:44:20.910 --> 00:44:24.180
that could not be sacrificed.

00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:27.240
Moreover, keeping
Radcliffe intact

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:30.810
was seen as a feminist act.

00:44:30.810 --> 00:44:34.080
As a group of alumni
leaders put it,

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:36.300
a separate Radcliffe
would continue

00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:41.860
to make useful contributions
to the education of women.

00:44:41.860 --> 00:44:44.070
Emerged Radcliffe,
they said, would

00:44:44.070 --> 00:44:49.140
silence an eloquent champion
of educational opportunities

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.350
for women.

00:44:51.350 --> 00:44:56.890
So the 1970s began with the
non-merger merger, an agreement

00:44:56.890 --> 00:45:00.610
signed by Polly
Bunting and Derek Bok

00:45:00.610 --> 00:45:06.640
just after Bok succeeded
Pusey in the summer of 1971.

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:09.940
It stipulated that Harvard
would take responsibility

00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:13.660
for operating the
Radcliffe houses as part

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:17.080
of the unified house system,
that Harvard would manage

00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:19.960
the business
operations of Radcliffe

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.220
including dining services,
buildings and grounds,

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:27.010
and the controller's office.

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:31.610
The agreement said further
that Radcliffe would turn over

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:36.070
to Harvard its
unrestricted endowment

00:45:36.070 --> 00:45:40.630
income, current undesignated
gifts, and the small percentage

00:45:40.630 --> 00:45:44.860
of tuition income that it
had retained, all of which

00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:50.140
Harvard would then use to pay
Radcliffe's operating expenses.

00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:53.380
Radcliffe would
retain responsibility

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.130
for the Institute, for the
Schlesinger Library, career

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:59.850
counseling, and
the alumni office.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:03.640
And it would retain
ownership of its property

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:07.240
and manage its endowment.

00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:13.720
That is where things stood
when Matina Horner became

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:18.800
president of Radcliffe in 1972.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:22.540
Influenced by
second-wave feminism,

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:26.990
Horner also brought to bear
her own important scholarship

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:30.390
on women's fear of success.

00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:33.020
And she believed
that Polly Bunting

00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.550
had gone too far in folding
Radcliffe into Harvard.

00:46:38.550 --> 00:46:41.150
She believed that it
was important to sustain

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:44.150
Radcliffe's corporate
independence

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:48.590
and that financial deal
that Bunting and Bok struck

00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:52.340
was not to
Radcliffe's advantage.

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.750
Considerable work was done
between the two institutions

00:46:56.750 --> 00:47:01.640
to try to work out terms
for further cooperation.

00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:06.350
But in November of 1976,
the Radcliffe trustees

00:47:06.350 --> 00:47:09.590
called a halt and
declared that Radcliffe

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:12.980
would remain an
independent institution

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:18.515
to carry out programs to promote
the higher education of women.

00:47:18.515 --> 00:47:24.200
And in 1977, Horner and
Bok signed a new agreement

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.960
laying out the terms of
a continuing coordinate

00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:30.490
relationship whereby
Radcliffe would remain legally

00:47:30.490 --> 00:47:35.420
independent of Harvard,
would play stipulated roles

00:47:35.420 --> 00:47:38.990
in seeing to the well-being
of women at Harvard,

00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:41.960
and would take back at
least symbolic if not

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:45.290
actual control of
fiscal matters that had

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:49.790
been seated to Harvard in 1971.

00:47:49.790 --> 00:47:55.430
And that is where things stood
when Linda Wilson succeeded

00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:58.520
Matina Horner as
president in 1989

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:04.580
and Neil Rudenstine
succeeded Derek Bok in 1991.

00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:09.320
With Rudenstine's
urging in cooperation

00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:11.960
not only with Wilson, but
with Nancy-Beth Gordon

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:15.730
Sheer, the chair of
the Radcliffe trustees,

00:48:15.730 --> 00:48:20.690
Harvard and Radcliffe signed
yet another agreement in 1999

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:24.290
merging the two
institutions and providing

00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:27.650
for the establishment of
the Radcliffe Institute

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:30.400
for Advanced Study,
under whose aegis

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.110
we were gathered this afternoon.

00:48:34.110 --> 00:48:38.720
Let me turn finally
to my third theme,

00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.180
the question of
what can be learned

00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:46.700
from the fight for coeducation
as we think about breaking

00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.710
through the barriers
women continue

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:55.010
to face in higher education, the
professions, and public life.

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:58.290
I'm going to focus
on higher education.

00:48:58.290 --> 00:49:02.300
Many of you know more than
I do about the professions.

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:05.540
And I find this a
particularly dispiriting time

00:49:05.540 --> 00:49:11.340
to talk about barriers
to women in public life.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:14.570
The first thing to say is
that the fight for coeducation

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:18.980
shows us, I think, that
institutional change is

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.680
really hard to accomplish.

00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.640
And this is a
controversial point.

00:49:26.640 --> 00:49:29.850
I think it shows us
that it is more likely

00:49:29.850 --> 00:49:33.090
that institutional
change will happen when

00:49:33.090 --> 00:49:36.360
it is in the clear
interest of the men who

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:38.880
run the institutions.

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:43.170
In other words, protesting
or storming the barricades

00:49:43.170 --> 00:49:47.580
probably won't get
you all the way there.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:50.970
My second point is that
coeducation actually

00:49:50.970 --> 00:49:54.540
accomplished a lot,
but at the same time

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:57.810
there was a lot that it did not
accomplish and could not have

00:49:57.810 --> 00:50:01.230
been expected to accomplish.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:06.330
As for what it accomplished,
the one incontrovertible point

00:50:06.330 --> 00:50:11.280
is that coeducation has opened
educational opportunities

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.330
for women that had not
previously existed.

00:50:15.330 --> 00:50:20.310
Being able to attend
previously all-male colleges

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:23.700
and universities has
given women access

00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:27.810
to a broader range of
educational opportunities.

00:50:27.810 --> 00:50:35.670
Women now have full access, as
men do, to the best university

00:50:35.670 --> 00:50:39.710
education in the
Anglo American world,

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.420
to faculty members
at the cutting

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.780
edge of their
respective disciplines,

00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:50.220
as well as to the best
libraries, laboratories,

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:54.600
and other educational
facilities.

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:58.350
And women students
have the opportunity

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:06.180
to profit from the intellectual
stimulation and interchange as

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:11.130
well as the social interactions
fostered in mixed sex

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:13.920
educational environments.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:17.880
Going to school
together means learning

00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.000
to live and work together.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.710
And in the 21st Century,
as you well know,

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.450
most college-bound students
see coeducational environments

00:51:27.450 --> 00:51:33.330
as more normal than
environments segregated by sex.

00:51:33.330 --> 00:51:35.770
But then comes the but.

00:51:35.770 --> 00:51:41.900
And in any major social
change, it's usually the case

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.510
that there is a but.

00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:50.060
If we consider the impact
of coeducation on colleges

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:54.260
and universities, the first
point to be made, I think,

00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:58.840
is that coeducation did
not mean revolution.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:01.730
Women were added to the mix.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:04.810
But the institutions
themselves proved

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.310
to be remarkably durable.

00:52:08.310 --> 00:52:14.110
And women generally accepted
or embraced traditions

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:19.600
rather than challenging
and up-ending them.

00:52:19.600 --> 00:52:22.930
In the United States
and the United Kingdom,

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:28.570
women were included,
assimilated, accepted.

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:31.600
Colleges and universities
were flexible enough

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:35.740
to accommodate them,
but not so flexible

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.000
that the institutions became
unrecognizable compared

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.090
with their former selves.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.860
The second important
point, I think,

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:49.160
is that coeducation
accompanied but did not

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:53.300
cause more profound
social transformations

00:52:53.300 --> 00:52:56.120
in these colleges
and universities.

00:52:56.120 --> 00:53:00.170
And by that, I mean diversity
in terms of race, ethnicity,

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:03.080
and socioeconomic background.

00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.500
Elite education
in the late 1960s

00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.880
began to be less aristocratic
and more democratic

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:12.920
or meritocratic.

00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:15.560
But that happened
in parallel with,

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:20.300
not as a result of coeducation.

00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:25.210
Now for all the gains
realized through coeducation,

00:53:25.210 --> 00:53:29.220
it's important to be clear about
what coeducation has not done

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:33.750
and I think should not
have been expected to do.

00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:38.580
Coeducation has not resolved
the longstanding complexities

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.690
in relations between
men and women.

00:53:42.690 --> 00:53:46.770
To be explicit, sexual
harassment and sexual assault

00:53:46.770 --> 00:53:51.570
are no more under control
after almost a half century

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:55.950
of coeducation than they
were when men and women first

00:53:55.950 --> 00:54:00.010
started going to
college together.

00:54:00.010 --> 00:54:03.350
And one has only
to look to Harvard

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:07.400
and this very afternoon's
faculty of Arts and Sciences

00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.200
deliberations to appreciate
the frustrating tenacity

00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.880
of structures within which
men associate with one another

00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:23.120
for social purposes in ways that
exclude and objectify women,

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:27.620
where gender discrimination
and sexual harassment

00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:33.460
are built into the fabric of
institutions, institutions

00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:36.110
that long predate coeducation.

00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:38.660
And I could easily
broaden the observation

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:43.550
and change the focus
to the inimical effects

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:48.220
on women of gender segregation
in the professional world.

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:53.270
Think Silicon Valley, to
take a current example,

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:56.030
where again gender
discrimination

00:54:56.030 --> 00:54:59.000
and sexual harassment
seem to be built

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.350
into the fabric of
institutions, but in this case

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:08.180
institutions that
are quite new, that

00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:14.900
were created well after the wave
of decisions for coeducation.

00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:19.220
To move to another
sphere, I would

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:22.850
note that coeducation
has not resolved

00:55:22.850 --> 00:55:29.540
the perplexingly gendered
behaviors and aspirations

00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:31.670
of female students.

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:34.010
Look at the Duke
Women's Initiative

00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:37.550
in 2003, the Princeton
steering committee

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:43.820
on undergraduate women's
leadership in 2011, telling us

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:49.400
about gender patterns in terms
of women in leadership, sex

00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.790
stereotyping,
gendered social norms,

00:55:52.790 --> 00:55:57.530
differential patterns
of academic achievement

00:55:57.530 --> 00:56:01.430
among men and women.

00:56:01.430 --> 00:56:04.280
Coeducation has not
resolved the conundrum

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.880
of gendered fields
of study, especially

00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:10.340
the persistent
under-representation

00:56:10.340 --> 00:56:12.740
of undergraduate
women in such fields

00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:17.390
as computer science,
economics, math, and physics.

00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:23.210
Nor has coeducation balanced the
highly skewed gender patterns

00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:28.790
among college and university
faculty and graduate students.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:33.110
And coeducation
has certainly not

00:56:33.110 --> 00:56:38.390
ensured that women alumni can
expect professional careers

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:41.420
that parallel those of men.

00:56:41.420 --> 00:56:45.440
Despite the ample supply
of female graduates

00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.990
of highly prestigious,
previously

00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:51.500
all-male institutions,
women continue

00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:57.200
to face challenges in
finding leadership positions

00:56:57.200 --> 00:56:59.960
and professional advancement.

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:02.900
And pressing issues
remain in the area

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.440
of work-family balance.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:10.310
In short, while we are rightly
to celebrate the achievements

00:57:10.310 --> 00:57:14.840
of coeducation, we should
remind ourselves, I think,

00:57:14.840 --> 00:57:20.390
that coeducation at the most
elite colleges and universities

00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:24.110
did not solve and could
not have been expected

00:57:24.110 --> 00:57:28.730
to solve persistently
challenging

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:32.420
personal and social
issues that continue

00:57:32.420 --> 00:57:37.130
to have a profound
influence on opportunities

00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:42.440
as well as gender relations
in American society.

00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:44.420
Let me stop there I'd
be delighted to take

00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:45.480
your questions.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:48.420
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.050
Yes.

00:58:01.050 --> 00:58:02.240
- My name is Amanda Cross.

00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:07.800
I entered Radcliffe
in the class of '69.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:12.070
I've always been interested in--

00:58:12.070 --> 00:58:13.720
I was a applied math major.

00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:15.780
I'm a numbers person.

00:58:15.780 --> 00:58:17.970
How different were
the SAT scores

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:20.880
between the males being
admitted to Radcliffe

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.640
and the males being
admitted to Harvard

00:58:23.640 --> 00:58:25.410
and the women being
admitted to Radcliffe?

00:58:25.410 --> 00:58:28.110
It's always been
interesting to me to--

00:58:28.110 --> 00:58:33.470
because of that quota you talked
about, the four to one ratio.

00:58:33.470 --> 00:58:34.580
How different was it?

00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.740
Is that something that
anybody ever tracked?

00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:37.760
- Well, look.

00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:40.280
The question has to do with
the difference in the SAT

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:44.150
scores between Radcliffe
students and Harvard students.

00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:46.310
I would describe that
difference the way

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:51.530
I would describe the credentials
of the first women who

00:58:51.530 --> 00:58:56.480
entered Princeton or Yale
compared with the men there.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.970
In the case of the men, the
credentials look like that.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:05.040
In the case of the women,
they look like that.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:05.540
- Yes.

00:59:05.540 --> 00:59:09.530
I assumed that, but I've just
never seen it in writing.

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:10.640
Thank you.

00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:14.780
- When I said Radcliffe women
matched if not over-matched

00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.530
Harvard men, they really
were at the top end

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:21.360
of the distribution.

00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.900
- I'm Kendra Stearns O'Donnell.

00:59:22.900 --> 00:59:27.130
And I arrived at Princeton
on the faculty in 1971

00:59:27.130 --> 00:59:30.100
and looked up to you.

00:59:30.100 --> 00:59:32.170
But I remember
how very difficult

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:34.750
it was not only for the
few women on the faculty,

00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:37.690
but also for the first coeds.

00:59:37.690 --> 00:59:42.610
And I am struck by your point
that the decision to go coed

00:59:42.610 --> 00:59:46.030
was so abrupt and had
really so little planning

00:59:46.030 --> 00:59:50.170
in terms of how the culture or
how the community might have

00:59:50.170 --> 00:59:54.460
to change to bring women in.

00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:58.330
And do you think that the
history of coeducation

00:59:58.330 --> 01:00:01.300
in these elite institutions
would have been different

01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:03.970
had there been
years of planning,

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:06.820
had people really worked out
the residential piece, all

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.470
the rest of it?

01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:12.760
- I think the problem
is that the people who

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:17.740
were doing the deliberating and
making the decisions were men.

01:00:17.740 --> 01:00:21.370
And they really didn't
know how to think

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:24.110
about the education of women.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:26.320
If you look at the
Patterson Report,

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:32.590
a very careful, thorough,
sober, sensible analysis--

01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:34.180
it's a long report.

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.840
And less than one
full page relates

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.850
to whether Princeton could
do justice to women students.

01:00:42.850 --> 01:00:46.160
And it meanders in
so many directions

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.650
that you just have no idea what
Gardner Patterson is thinking.

01:00:50.650 --> 01:00:54.070
I think the problem
is that Kingman

01:00:54.070 --> 01:01:01.040
Brewster and his colleagues
moved faster than Princeton.

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.050
But they had the same
problem that Bob Goheen

01:01:05.050 --> 01:01:08.140
and Bill Bowen and their
colleagues had at Princeton.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.520
They just didn't know.

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.490
And they tried to
inform themselves.

01:01:12.490 --> 01:01:15.750
They brought in outside
experts, Polly Bunting

01:01:15.750 --> 01:01:18.700
and some distinguished
women educators

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:23.830
from other institutions,
to talk about how to do it.

01:01:23.830 --> 01:01:25.780
What decisions did
you need to make?

01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:28.400
What arrangements
did you need to make?

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.530
But they just didn't know.

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:33.880
And their assumption was
they would figure it out.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.460
When the women students
arrived, the women students

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:41.360
would essentially tell them
what they wanted and needed.

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:45.530
So I think even if they had
had a long time to plan,

01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.800
they wouldn't have
known how to do it,

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:51.040
because they were in the
business of educating men.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:02:00.590
- I'm Lewis Counts, an MIT grad
married to a Radcliffe grad.

01:02:00.590 --> 01:02:03.680
You mentioned Berkeley as
one of the great land grant

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:08.210
schools along with Illinois,
who a century before the schools

01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:11.600
had seemed to have been
cordoned off by the Hudson River

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:15.440
for many kind of reason,
decided to admit women.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.440
Now, was there any
discussion that you

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:23.090
found of how things were
going at Berkeley or Illinois

01:02:23.090 --> 01:02:26.180
or Ohio or other great schools?

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.510
I would argue in
many ways greater,

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:34.650
because they've educated more
people on the east coast.

01:02:34.650 --> 01:02:36.407
Was there any awareness?

01:02:36.407 --> 01:02:37.740
You were talking about planning.

01:02:37.740 --> 01:02:41.757
There were ample role
models and success stories.

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.590
- You have to understand
that Harvard, Yale,

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:45.540
and Princeton don't
normally think

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:47.730
in terms of Illinois and Ohio.

01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:50.980
It's just not the way it works.

01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:55.380
They did visit a
lot of institutions.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:58.050
Stanford was the
coed institution

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:03.150
most often considered
as somehow analogous.

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.360
Chicago was considered.

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:09.180
But it would not
have dawned on them

01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.514
really to look at the
experience that a lot

01:03:12.514 --> 01:03:14.430
of major universities,
which they didn't think

01:03:14.430 --> 01:03:16.320
were like them.

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:21.090
What's really interesting about
some of the universities that

01:03:21.090 --> 01:03:24.420
went coed in the 19th Century--

01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:28.680
interesting to me-- is
how complicated it was.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:34.170
Let's take the cases of Stanford
and Chicago, both of them

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.040
coeducational from the outset.

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:41.430
In the case of
Chicago, the problem

01:03:41.430 --> 01:03:43.660
was that too many
women were enrolling

01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:46.410
and they were doing too well.

01:03:46.410 --> 01:03:49.830
And Chicago was a
new university and it

01:03:49.830 --> 01:03:52.920
depended on important
philanthropy in the city.

01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:57.990
And the assumption was that if
the place was overrun by women,

01:03:57.990 --> 01:04:00.580
they'd never be able to raise
money to support the place.

01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.750
So they put in place
a cockamamie scheme

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:09.600
to separate women and men
in the introductory courses

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.690
and then let them
study together later.

01:04:11.690 --> 01:04:13.860
Well that withered away.

01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:18.600
At Stanford, it's founded
as a coed institution

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.130
by Leland and Jane Stanford
in memory of their young son

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.840
who had died.

01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.620
By the time Stanford
starts up in the 1890s,

01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:31.380
Leland Stanford has died.

01:04:31.380 --> 01:04:34.410
So Jane Stanford
is the actor here.

01:04:34.410 --> 01:04:37.380
And what she sees
is the same thing.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.590
There are too many women
coming to Stanford,

01:04:39.590 --> 01:04:41.500
and they are doing too well.

01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:46.570
And if you let that continue
to happen, for goodness sakes,

01:04:46.570 --> 01:04:48.060
what kind of a
memorial will this

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:50.460
be to young Leland Stanford?

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:55.830
So she sees to it that they
impose a cap of 500 women

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.960
students in the student body.

01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:01.080
And that stays in place
until the 1930s when it gets

01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:03.325
relaxed a little because
of the depression.

01:05:03.325 --> 01:05:05.940
And it's really
not till the 1960s

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:09.360
that things get equalized.

01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:13.570
Wesleyan University tries
admitting women in the 1870s.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:15.250
The exact same thing.

01:05:15.250 --> 01:05:19.290
Too many women,
they're doing too well.

01:05:19.290 --> 01:05:21.780
And the Wesleyan
trustees respond

01:05:21.780 --> 01:05:26.910
in the early years of the 20th
Century by kicking them out.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:31.020
And women alums of Wesleyan
found Connecticut College

01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:31.790
for Women.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:38.010
Berkeley is a complicated story.

01:05:38.010 --> 01:05:41.400
Cornell, another early
coed institution,

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:44.580
is a complicated story.

01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:47.490
Michigan, another
early coed institution.

01:05:47.490 --> 01:05:51.150
There's a lot of separating
of women from men

01:05:51.150 --> 01:05:55.620
and a lot of gendered
arrangements and behaviors.

01:05:55.620 --> 01:06:00.740
It's not a smooth,
easy story here.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:01.240
- Hi.

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:02.860
I'm Julie Anderson.

01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:07.180
I was a graduate in
1971 from Radcliffe.

01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:10.180
And actually you answered
pretty much my question.

01:06:10.180 --> 01:06:11.640
I come from California.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:16.260
And so I wondered is your
analysis of coeducation--

01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:19.930
does it apply from the east
coast to these Western schools?

01:06:19.930 --> 01:06:21.730
And as you've said.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:25.570
But those rather
dispiriting statistics

01:06:25.570 --> 01:06:30.070
at the end of your talk that
it doesn't really change

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:32.980
our culture's idea about women.

01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:36.910
Do we know that that's true from
some of those Western schools

01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:37.970
as well?

01:06:37.970 --> 01:06:41.080
Do we have that
same set of outcomes

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:44.500
that it hasn't really changed
the institutions that much?

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:46.150
- Look, I'm looking nationally.

01:06:46.150 --> 01:06:49.030
I'm looking at women in
the professions, women

01:06:49.030 --> 01:06:51.940
in public life.

01:06:51.940 --> 01:06:55.180
How women fare in
major corporations

01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:58.600
and financial
institutions, for example,

01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.460
is not a regional phenomenon.

01:07:01.460 --> 01:07:05.720
It's a national phenomenon.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:09.640
So I think we've got problems
that are not regional--

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:10.480
- That are enduring.

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:10.979
Yeah.

01:07:10.979 --> 01:07:11.620
Thanks.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:12.812
Wonderful talk.

01:07:12.812 --> 01:07:14.700
- Thank you.

01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:15.240
- Hello.

01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.710
My name is Lisa Goldman.

01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:19.560
And I was in the second
class of freshmen

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.007
to be admitted to Yale
that contained women.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:24.590
And thank you.

01:07:24.590 --> 01:07:27.090
You've explained
why everything--

01:07:27.090 --> 01:07:28.170
there was no--

01:07:28.170 --> 01:07:30.480
I now understand why
there was nothing

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:32.580
for women when we got there.

01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:35.670
I've always wondered about that.

01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:42.720
My question for you is, we
still have a long way to go.

01:07:42.720 --> 01:07:47.100
And I think even within
all of these institutions,

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:49.860
even though they
are now coeducated,

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:52.470
we still have a long way to go.

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:54.180
And I am wondering--

01:07:54.180 --> 01:07:57.810
and we now know that separate
but equal does not work.

01:08:00.390 --> 01:08:02.820
I'm wondering what
recommendations

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:07.500
you would make as the
result of your research

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.530
as to how we can
arrive at a more

01:08:10.530 --> 01:08:13.230
equitable society in general.

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.850
It's a big-- I apologize.

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:16.710
It's a big question.

01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:20.250
But I'm wondering if you
drew any conclusions that

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:23.279
could guide us in trying
to move in that direction.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.270
- Look, I'm an historian.

01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:25.970
I am not--

01:08:25.970 --> 01:08:27.435
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:28.810
- You must have
learned something

01:08:28.810 --> 01:08:30.550
from all your research.

01:08:30.550 --> 01:08:33.870
- I think-- no.

01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:38.609
Let me tell you a couple
of small examples.

01:08:38.609 --> 01:08:43.319
It took Nan Keohane at the
end of her presidency of Duke

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:45.930
to establish the Women's
Initiative to look

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:51.060
into the differential experience
of men and women at Duke,

01:08:51.060 --> 01:08:55.859
even though Duke had been
functionally coed for decades

01:08:55.859 --> 01:08:57.000
by then.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.240
The whole business of
effortless perfection

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.620
as undergraduate women
saw the self-fashioning

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:06.660
that they had to engage in.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.680
It took Shirley Tilghman as
president of Princeton in 2011

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.390
to say, wait a minute.

01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:14.910
Women students are not
presenting themselves

01:09:14.910 --> 01:09:20.040
for the highest profile
leadership positions on campus.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:24.300
And while women in general are
outperforming men academically,

01:09:24.300 --> 01:09:28.380
at the very, very top
the men have a lock

01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:31.479
on the highest achievement.

01:09:31.479 --> 01:09:33.240
What's going on here?

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:40.979
I think in part, having issues
raised to public visibility

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:45.550
and impanelling people to work
on them makes a difference.

01:09:45.550 --> 01:09:48.660
It certainly has made
some difference at Duke

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:52.529
and some difference
at Princeton.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:54.060
Can you generalize from that?

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:54.870
Of course not.

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:57.690
I mean, for goodness sakes.

01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:02.790
The debate Anne-Marie Slaughter
and Sheryl Sandberg about

01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:07.020
work-family balance, leaning
in and all the rest--

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.070
I don't know how you fix that.

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:11.100
The revelations
we've been seeing

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:16.290
from companies in Silicon
Valley about the way they

01:10:16.290 --> 01:10:18.000
treat women--

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.560
My husband just gave me a
paper from the National Bureau

01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.030
of Economic Research
on men and women

01:10:27.030 --> 01:10:29.040
who are financial advisers.

01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:32.790
And women are less
represented in the ranks

01:10:32.790 --> 01:10:34.420
of financial advisors.

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:35.610
They're paid less.

01:10:35.610 --> 01:10:40.750
And they're disciplined more
often for misbehavior than men.

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:45.030
Well, how do you reform an
industry or a corporation?

01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:47.490
I don't know the answer to that.

01:10:47.490 --> 01:10:51.870
But public attention
and discussion

01:10:51.870 --> 01:10:56.187
is certainly an
important beginning.

01:10:56.187 --> 01:10:57.270
- My name is Philip Lynch.

01:10:57.270 --> 01:10:58.890
I'm also an MIT graduate.

01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:01.230
So I wonder if it says
anything that the two

01:11:01.230 --> 01:11:04.920
men in line for questions
both graduated from MIT.

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:07.410
And also I want
to recall the fact

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:11.150
that MIT has been coed from
sometime in the latter half

01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:12.810
of the 1800s.

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.910
And I wonder if it
had the problems

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.910
that Stanford and Chicago
complained about in terms

01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:19.920
of alumni contributions.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.960
But that's not my question.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.810
My question is the experience
of Columbia and Barnard,

01:11:24.810 --> 01:11:29.110
which I understand considered
merging and decided not to

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:31.320
and then Columbia went coed--

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.280
I wonder if you could say a
few words about that episode.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.940
It must have been interesting.

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:36.605
Thank you.

01:11:36.605 --> 01:11:40.620
- Well, Columbia essentially
wanted to take over

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:44.280
Barnard College in the 1970s.

01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:47.580
And there were very strong
Barnard trustees, women

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:50.090
who said, wait a minute.

01:11:50.090 --> 01:11:52.640
We are not going to do that.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.820
And they preserved the college,
which is thriving today,

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:03.000
I think, as a women's
college, in the context

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:08.258
of the larger university.

01:12:08.258 --> 01:12:11.460
- So any conclusions from that?

01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.890
- Look, its an
idiosyncratic case.

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:17.000
Barnard was different.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:21.040
Barnard-Columbia was different
from Radcliffe-Harvard

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:22.120
because Barnard--

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.540
among other things, Barnard
had its own faculty.

01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.540
When you don't have
a faculty, it's

01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:32.616
a whole different
proposition as a college.

01:12:32.616 --> 01:12:34.990
- Thank you.

01:12:34.990 --> 01:12:35.490
- Hi.

01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.580
I'm Susan [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.450
And I'm from the class
of '71 at Radcliffe.

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:44.350
So an observation
and a question.

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.510
I mean, I was aware--

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:48.030
I mean, I guess I
was just clueless.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.590
But it never occurred
to me I wasn't

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:53.260
going to a coed institution.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:56.020
I mean, I know that I had
been admitted to Radcliffe.

01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.540
And we knew we were smarter
than the guys at Harvard

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:02.290
because there were 300
of us and 1,000 of them.

01:13:02.290 --> 01:13:07.390
But beyond that and those dorms,
which I got out of as soon

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:10.090
as I could, it seemed to me--

01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:12.310
I never would have
gone there if I hadn't

01:13:12.310 --> 01:13:15.190
felt like it was a coed school.

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.780
So that was my experience.

01:13:16.780 --> 01:13:19.160
Years later, I
thought, that's true.

01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:21.970
There weren't many women
faculty, were there?

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:24.880
But my experience was as a coed.

01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:28.780
We did every-- so all of
the stuff later on about

01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:31.690
the merging and this and
that, it was sort of--

01:13:31.690 --> 01:13:34.120
I don't know how
much that impacted

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:37.510
the undergraduate experience.

01:13:37.510 --> 01:13:40.900
And then my question was to
you, it would be interesting--

01:13:40.900 --> 01:13:43.990
I wondered-- you were
talking about the impetus

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:48.340
towards coeducation was purely
because the men's colleges were

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.920
losing some of
their best students

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:54.520
who didn't want to go
to all-male schools.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:57.400
Wasn't that sort of-- wasn't
that also true for some

01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:01.660
of the women's colleges,
the same kinds of debates,

01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:04.240
that it wasn't because
they wanted to give up

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:08.650
women's-only education, but they
were not getting the students

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:09.460
they wanted to get?

01:14:09.460 --> 01:14:10.950
So some of them went coed.

01:14:10.950 --> 01:14:11.530
I don't know.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.450
It would be interesting
to have a parallel--

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:14.199
- Yeah, that was--

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:15.320
- --talk about that.

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:19.880
- That was certainly the
imperative at Vassar.

01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:24.670
Vassar, by the late 1960s,
was seeing a real drop-off

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:26.910
in applications and yields.

01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:31.840
It was lagging well behind
Smith and Wellesley.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.380
Vassar had the
problem of location.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:39.130
Except for West Point a
half hour up the river,

01:14:39.130 --> 01:14:43.240
there just weren't any
men's colleges nearby.

01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.350
And getting a
significant population

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:50.530
of fully qualified
women students

01:14:50.530 --> 01:14:53.730
was a pressing
concern for Vassar.

01:14:53.730 --> 01:14:56.710
And in the case of
Vassar, the decision

01:14:56.710 --> 01:15:00.100
was that the right
solution was to bring

01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:04.690
men, which was a big relief
to alumnae after they

01:15:04.690 --> 01:15:06.000
got to keep their campus.

01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.380
They didn't have to
move to New Haven.

01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:12.560
Sharing their campus
with men wasn't so bad.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:18.700
At Smith and Wellesley,
that was an issue,

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:23.050
not because the
drop-off in talent

01:15:23.050 --> 01:15:27.970
had been seen yet so much as
because of the fear of what

01:15:27.970 --> 01:15:31.120
would happen with the
men's schools going coed.

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.480
Once you were competing
with Princeton and Yale,

01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.090
for example, would a significant
population of talented women

01:15:40.090 --> 01:15:44.500
keep applying to and
matriculating at places

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:48.970
like Smith and Wellesley?

01:15:48.970 --> 01:15:54.310
And as at Vassar, could
you get enough talented men

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:57.040
if you decided on coeducation.

01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:01.810
Smith and Wellesley both had
reasons for not going coed,

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:05.780
whereas Vassar had
reasons for going coed.

01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:10.240
But the question of admissions
was front and center

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:12.060
for all of them.

01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:12.970
- Great talk.

01:16:12.970 --> 01:16:15.120
- Thank you.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:15.620
- Hi.

01:16:15.620 --> 01:16:16.880
I'm Connie Franklin.

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:20.350
I came to Radcliffe in 1968.

01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:23.510
And I don't really
have a question so much

01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:26.810
as a little testimonial,
because a million times as I

01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:29.400
read your book and as I listened
to you today, I thought,

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.160
yes, yes, yes.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.470
I remember that.

01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:37.190
So an ode to the old Radcliffe.

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:39.620
It was a lovely time to be here.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:43.730
It was like being in a small
school with the support

01:16:43.730 --> 01:16:49.280
of gracious and interested women
in the form of the Radcliffe

01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.840
administrators.

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:56.357
And yet you were in this
ocean of incredible resources.

01:16:56.357 --> 01:16:58.190
And you did need their
support, because when

01:16:58.190 --> 01:17:01.440
you walked into class, it
was a sea of male faces.

01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:05.090
And they were not
always friendly.

01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:07.900
In terms of the
relative qualifications

01:17:07.900 --> 01:17:12.050
of the Cliffies as opposed
to the Harvard guys,

01:17:12.050 --> 01:17:14.940
I had an epiphany that has
lasted with me my whole life

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:17.240
in expository
writing freshman year

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:20.810
when we peer reviewed
each other's papers

01:17:20.810 --> 01:17:24.620
and I looked at what my male
counterparts had written.

01:17:24.620 --> 01:17:26.150
And I thought, oh my god.

01:17:26.150 --> 01:17:28.885
If this is the best of the
best, we are in deep trouble.

01:17:28.885 --> 01:17:31.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:32.610
- That's it.

01:17:32.610 --> 01:17:35.190
I remember walking
into Harvard Freshman

01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:37.860
Union with a date
on a Friday night

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:41.550
and the tinkling of the
glasses, because a woman had

01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:43.140
entered the room.

01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:46.860
I remember an argument
with a guy at Harvard

01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:51.330
who thought it would be
horrible if women came to live

01:17:51.330 --> 01:17:53.250
in the Harvard Houses because--

01:17:53.250 --> 01:17:55.680
and even if they came to
live in the Harvard houses,

01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.780
don't let them into the
libraries in the Harvard

01:17:57.780 --> 01:17:59.100
Houses.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:02.340
It was quite a time.

01:18:02.340 --> 01:18:07.350
And of course, at my
commencement in 1972,

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:14.470
a lot of us wore equal sign--

01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:18.130
excuse me, the sign for
women with an equal inside.

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:20.830
And there was a
petition floating around

01:18:20.830 --> 01:18:22.390
for sex-blind admissions.

01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:27.080
Very controversial at the time.

01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:32.740
Thank you for your work and
validating and showing it

01:18:32.740 --> 01:18:36.850
all to us from a
different perspective.

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:38.170
Really.

01:18:38.170 --> 01:18:38.800
- Thank you.

01:18:41.762 --> 01:18:42.470
- Thanks so much.

01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:43.420
That was wonderful.

01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:44.760
My name is Genevieve Dempsey.

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.690
I'm a fellow at
the Hutchins Center

01:18:46.690 --> 01:18:48.970
for African and
African-American research.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:52.960
My question today is regarding
the classroom and discourse

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.410
in the classroom and how we
might bring some of the ideas

01:18:56.410 --> 01:18:58.990
you talked about today
into the classroom,

01:18:58.990 --> 01:19:02.200
regardless of whether it's a
physics class or world music

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.560
class, because oftentimes
I find that if I would like

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:09.160
to talk about gender, I have
to go to a class on gender

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:10.790
in Latin America or something.

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:13.030
And so I don't feel like--

01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:19.210
I feel like your speech today
is a wonderful kind of testament

01:19:19.210 --> 01:19:21.440
to how far we've come.

01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:23.860
But I'm very much on
board with what you say.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:26.710
I'm just wondering how do we
get this message to people

01:19:26.710 --> 01:19:31.180
that are perhaps more
resistant to the ideas.

01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:33.940
- I really understand
what you're

01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:36.250
talking about in terms
of talking about gender.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:40.690
When I used to teach big
lecture courses in 20th Century

01:19:40.690 --> 01:19:44.380
American History, if I was
lecturing on the civil rights

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:48.100
movement, my male students
were fully engaged.

01:19:48.100 --> 01:19:49.930
When I lectured on
the women's movement,

01:19:49.930 --> 01:19:51.680
that was another matter.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:56.185
Why are you spending our time
on this, was the reaction

01:19:56.185 --> 01:20:01.040
that I would often get.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.530
If I knew the answer
to your question,

01:20:03.530 --> 01:20:09.750
I would be in the line of work
on transforming institutions

01:20:09.750 --> 01:20:11.250
of higher education.

01:20:11.250 --> 01:20:18.040
I think you have to be careful
to make sure not to always call

01:20:18.040 --> 01:20:18.940
on male students.

01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:22.370
I'm as guilty of this as anyone.

01:20:22.370 --> 01:20:27.850
In my classes, you were greatly
relieved when the hands go up

01:20:27.850 --> 01:20:30.110
rather than sitting
there thinking,

01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:33.580
who is going to have
something to say to that.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:37.190
And pausing to
think, wait a minute.

01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:40.810
Those kids are all male,
or the last three comments

01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:44.560
were from men, is sometimes
really hard to do.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:47.590
So remembering to stop
yourself for a moment

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:51.940
and make sure that the
women are as fully engaged

01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:55.210
in the conversation as the
men is the first thing,

01:20:55.210 --> 01:20:58.230
I think, a faculty
member has to do.

01:20:58.230 --> 01:21:04.810
And the second is making gender
a part of the conversation

01:21:04.810 --> 01:21:08.590
when you're talking about
other topics, when you're not

01:21:08.590 --> 01:21:12.400
in a course about
gender, but where--

01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:15.000
American social history,
American political history,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.530
where gender is part
of that conversation,

01:21:17.530 --> 01:21:23.480
as race is inevitably
part of that conversation.

01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:26.690
But the real solution,
you'll figure it out

01:21:26.690 --> 01:21:28.088
as soon as I will.

01:21:30.941 --> 01:21:31.441
- Hi.

01:21:31.441 --> 01:21:34.430
I'm Ken [? Kaufman. ?] I'm
a member of the Harvard

01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:36.020
class of '69.

01:21:36.020 --> 01:21:38.554
I first wanted to thank you
for coming and speaking today

01:21:38.554 --> 01:21:40.220
and also for your
book, which I've read,

01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:42.470
which is really terrific.

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:44.310
I just wanted to
spend a minute or two

01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:46.730
giving a Harvard student's
perspective on some

01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:48.720
of the issues you
were talking about,

01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.680
as somebody who was [INAUDIBLE]
involved in that at the time.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.630
But Vietnam was going on and
a lot of other issues were.

01:21:55.630 --> 01:21:57.980
I as a junior and
senior was involved

01:21:57.980 --> 01:22:00.950
in one of the two Harvard
College student government

01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:03.050
organizations, the
Harvard-Radcliffe policy

01:22:03.050 --> 01:22:04.734
committee.

01:22:04.734 --> 01:22:07.150
We were a little bit unusual
in that we had some Radcliffe

01:22:07.150 --> 01:22:11.450
students and we had some
faculty members that we invited.

01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:13.070
I became chair of the committee.

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:16.340
And Kay Tolbert, a Radcliffe
student, was the secretary.

01:22:16.340 --> 01:22:19.520
And we traditionally did audits
of the undergraduate programs

01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.570
of the major departments.

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.280
How good a job was
the English department

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.110
doing for undergraduates?

01:22:24.110 --> 01:22:26.690
But some of us felt
pretty strongly

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.600
that while, as you were
saying, Harvard held itself out

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:34.550
as a coeducational institution,
it really was not in many ways,

01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:36.770
particularly coming
as a freshman,

01:22:36.770 --> 01:22:39.980
living in the yard, all
men, the Freshmen Union.

01:22:39.980 --> 01:22:41.420
Dining facilities were all male.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:43.880
The houses were all male.

01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:48.620
And we felt that this was
indicative of a major cultural

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.590
issue at Harvard, which is that
female undergraduates didn't

01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:54.200
have the same
educational opportunities

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:57.020
and were not viewed as
intellectual or social peers

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.250
or equals.

01:22:58.250 --> 01:22:59.780
So we set up a subcommittee.

01:22:59.780 --> 01:23:02.240
And we spent about six
months doing a major study,

01:23:02.240 --> 01:23:04.220
taking polls and so on.

01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.890
And we issued a
report, which I spent

01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:09.640
a lot of time writing
over Christmas vacation,

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:14.000
'68, '69, in which the
committee had a lot of input on

01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:19.880
and which we issued
in early 1969

01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:22.226
saying that this was a
major issue, that it had

01:23:22.226 --> 01:23:23.600
to be addressed,
that it was more

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:25.760
important than
many other issues,

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:29.000
and that for starters change
should come within the house

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.020
system.

01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.540
And we recommended
a trial exchange

01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.070
between three Harvard houses--

01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:36.560
Lowell, Adams, and Winthrop--
and the three Radcliffe

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:39.530
houses as a first step,
the reason for that

01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:42.470
being that those were the
three whose masters wanted

01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:44.540
to have women in their houses.

01:23:44.540 --> 01:23:46.940
There were many who did not.

01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:50.150
And we recommended long
range that the houses

01:23:50.150 --> 01:23:52.430
go coed, although
allowing potentially

01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:54.830
for the option of
a non-coed house,

01:23:54.830 --> 01:23:58.790
although nobody ended up
wanting that, and consideration

01:23:58.790 --> 01:24:02.210
ultimately of a merger
between Harvard and Radcliffe

01:24:02.210 --> 01:24:06.170
and also moving toward
gender-blind admissions,

01:24:06.170 --> 01:24:08.720
increasing the number
of women admitted.

01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:12.950
And we then started
politicking and met

01:24:12.950 --> 01:24:17.000
with President Pusey in
mid-January, who basically said

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.210
he was in favor of
our main conclusions,

01:24:20.210 --> 01:24:23.600
but he was skeptical that
Radcliffe would agree to them

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:25.970
because Radcliffe
valued its independence

01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:28.800
and didn't want to be even
more under Harvard's thumb.

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:31.550
He also was concerned
about the legalities

01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:34.040
with Harvard taking
on responsibility

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.810
for Radcliffe students.

01:24:35.810 --> 01:24:37.580
We then met with
President Bunting

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:40.280
at Radcliffe, who
said she was in favor

01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:43.280
of most of our recommendations
but Harvard would never

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:47.510
go for them, because
Harvard treated Radcliffe

01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:50.690
as a kid sister and didn't
take it very seriously.

01:24:50.690 --> 01:24:55.280
And it was then in February
that she invited two of us

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:56.940
to a Radcliffe trustees meeting.

01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.150
They had never had
students there before.

01:25:00.150 --> 01:25:03.590
And then, as you were
saying in your talk,

01:25:03.590 --> 01:25:08.330
shortly after that the Radcliffe
governing board initiated

01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:10.760
the discussions with Harvard.

01:25:10.760 --> 01:25:16.700
And the Harvard faculty, after
a hiatus caused by the Vietnam

01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:20.870
issues with SDS and
so on, ultimately

01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.790
agreed with some of
our recommendations.

01:25:22.790 --> 01:25:25.940
And the trial exchange
was initiated a year later

01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:28.190
and the houses then went
coed, as you were saying.

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:31.490
And they started increasing
the numbers of women.

01:25:31.490 --> 01:25:32.930
The only point I
wanted to make is

01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:38.474
I think Harvard was an
example where student input--

01:25:38.474 --> 01:25:39.890
and it came from
the Harvard side.

01:25:39.890 --> 01:25:42.560
It was not from the
Radcliffe side--

01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:46.610
really did play a role in
accelerating what probably

01:25:46.610 --> 01:25:49.250
would have happened otherwise,
but in making it happen around

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:52.050
that time, and in shining
a light on these issues,

01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:54.950
which, as you point out,
still persist to this day.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:56.970
- You wrote a
really good report.

01:25:56.970 --> 01:26:01.070
And it's a good
example of instances

01:26:01.070 --> 01:26:06.320
where student initiative can
really make a difference.

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:12.680
And your examples at
Princeton as well, where

01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:16.100
it isn't that the students
made something happen,

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:22.260
but made administrators
reckon with realities

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:27.360
that administrators really
just didn't see before.

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:28.800
- Well, thank you.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.220
- Thank you.

01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:32.341
- Did you ever get--

01:26:32.341 --> 01:26:32.840
excuse me.

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:34.840
Meryl [? Sturbridge, ?]
class of '71.

01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:38.320
This all resonates deeply.

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:44.500
Did you ever get a whiff that
when these men administrators

01:26:44.500 --> 01:26:47.950
were talking about getting the
right kind of boys, that there

01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:50.110
was a wrong kind of boy?

01:26:50.110 --> 01:26:53.800
I know that there was
a lot of class change.

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.240
But was there any--

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.170
did you ever get any
whiff of homophobia?

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:02.980
- Nobody was talking about
homophobia, at least not

01:27:02.980 --> 01:27:07.270
in any sources that I've seen.

01:27:07.270 --> 01:27:13.740
The best boys were the
top-ranking boys, generally

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:18.040
at prep schools and some
of the best public schools.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:22.290
That's what the best boys meant.

01:27:22.290 --> 01:27:29.100
The all-around hugely
talented academically leaders

01:27:29.100 --> 01:27:33.000
who were probably accomplished
on the playing field

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.390
as well as in student
government and had

01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:41.850
the best grades, that's what
they meant by the best boys.

01:27:41.850 --> 01:27:42.690
- Hello.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:44.340
My name is Diane Williams.

01:27:44.340 --> 01:27:47.640
And I'm a female alum of MIT.

01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.180
And I went to school
when there was 14% women

01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.000
at the undergraduate level
and when they used the Sharpie

01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.910
to put W-O- men.

01:27:56.910 --> 01:27:59.620
And we still had the urinals
in some of the [INAUDIBLE]..

01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:02.370
So they didn't go fully coed.

01:28:02.370 --> 01:28:05.070
I'm also an alumna of
Harvard, the Graduate School

01:28:05.070 --> 01:28:07.500
of Education many years later.

01:28:07.500 --> 01:28:09.330
And I'm curious.

01:28:09.330 --> 01:28:11.370
I was here because
I saw the where

01:28:11.370 --> 01:28:13.590
are we going, because I
know a lot of the history

01:28:13.590 --> 01:28:16.200
certainly, having
lived some of it.

01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:17.830
I personally am involved.

01:28:17.830 --> 01:28:21.210
I'm the organizing lead
for an upcoming augmented

01:28:21.210 --> 01:28:24.750
virtual reality hackathon we're
having at the MIT Media Lab.

01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:27.170
And I'm specifically
part of diversity.

01:28:27.170 --> 01:28:31.480
Women-- all the things in
tech that you mentioned.

01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:34.500
I'm responsible
for ageism, sexism,

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:38.190
getting rid of any kind
of ism's, subject matter

01:28:38.190 --> 01:28:39.300
expertise.

01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.740
And that's sort
of my contribution

01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:43.200
to the legacy of
four days, I get

01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:45.320
to live the dream,
like what tech is not.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.860
But I want to try to change it.

01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:49.860
Is there anything else I can
do as a computer scientist

01:28:49.860 --> 01:28:53.670
to try to encourage women to
pursue it in higher education?

01:28:53.670 --> 01:28:57.144
Or stay with it in the field?

01:28:57.144 --> 01:28:58.560
- It sounds to me
as though you're

01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:01.590
doing a great job already.

01:29:01.590 --> 01:29:12.580
I think establishing mentoring
initiatives with young students

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.430
who come into college,
who think they might

01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:18.220
be interested in studying
computer science or math

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:22.150
or physics, and
having older students

01:29:22.150 --> 01:29:26.950
or older women who have done
this essentially get together

01:29:26.950 --> 01:29:32.970
with them and say, you should
do this, you can do this,

01:29:32.970 --> 01:29:35.410
really makes a difference.

01:29:35.410 --> 01:29:35.910
- OK.

01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:36.410
Thank you.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:39.770
- I'll make this quick.

01:29:39.770 --> 01:29:40.790
I'm Susan [INAUDIBLE].

01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:44.810
I have been president of the
MIT Women's Alumni Association

01:29:44.810 --> 01:29:49.160
and vice president of the
MIT Alumni Association.

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:52.430
And maybe things have
changed radically

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:54.620
in the '70s when
women's [INAUDIBLE]

01:29:54.620 --> 01:29:56.840
became very evident.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:30:00.670
But starting in 1873,
MIT had been coed,

01:30:00.670 --> 01:30:05.690
and it essentially was the first
coed school on the east coast.

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:08.530
And the women didn't
seem to have problems.

01:30:08.530 --> 01:30:11.480
In fact, the research that I've
done on the women, many of them

01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:15.550
actually earned not
only the same income

01:30:15.550 --> 01:30:19.060
as men in the profession,
but actually earned more.

01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:23.080
And speaking of Yale,
for one situation,

01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:25.540
one woman who got
a medical degree

01:30:25.540 --> 01:30:28.960
and worked in Europe,
when she came back

01:30:28.960 --> 01:30:32.950
because her husband had died,
Yale actually went to her

01:30:32.950 --> 01:30:36.070
and asked her to become
head of a new school,

01:30:36.070 --> 01:30:40.760
to start a new school there
in a medical research thing.

01:30:40.760 --> 01:30:42.940
So I think some
of the things that

01:30:42.940 --> 01:30:50.020
might have happened in the
last part of the 20th Century

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:54.690
may not have been the same
that people faced earlier.

01:30:54.690 --> 01:30:56.830
And in fact, like at Radcliffe--

01:30:56.830 --> 01:30:57.670
not at Radcliffe.

01:30:57.670 --> 01:30:58.170
I'm sorry.

01:30:58.170 --> 01:31:00.160
Barnard.

01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:02.350
Before Barnard was
established, women

01:31:02.350 --> 01:31:05.740
could attend Columbia's classes.

01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:08.590
And once Barnard
was established,

01:31:08.590 --> 01:31:11.170
the women
undergraduates could not

01:31:11.170 --> 01:31:14.450
attend Columbia classes,
only the graduate women.

01:31:14.450 --> 01:31:17.270
So I think there a lot of
changes that occurred over

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:24.360
history that has to be
considered in the whole thing,

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:28.480
not only the west coast things
which you have pointed out.

01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:29.905
That's all.

01:31:29.905 --> 01:31:30.530
- Good for MIT.

01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:35.630
I think we've done it.

01:31:35.630 --> 01:31:36.830
Thank you all so much.

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:39.580
