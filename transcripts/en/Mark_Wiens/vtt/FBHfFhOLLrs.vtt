00:00:00.981 --> 00:00:03.714
(chopping)

00:00:03.714 --> 00:00:04.791
- [Mark] That is a beauty.

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:06.605
A side of a goose here in,

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:09.605
just, that pool of flavorful juices.

00:00:12.758 --> 00:00:15.591
(uplifting music)

00:00:19.198 --> 00:00:20.702
Good morning everyone, it's Mark Wiens

00:00:20.702 --> 00:00:23.981
with Migrationology.com
in Bangkok, Thailand.

00:00:23.981 --> 00:00:26.503
Gonna pick up Dwight, my buddy Dwight,

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:29.141
and we are driving over
to a restaurant called

00:00:29.141 --> 00:00:32.385
Chua Kim Heng, which is very famous.

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:33.467
Oh hold on.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:36.306
There's Dwight right now.

00:00:36.306 --> 00:00:38.033
- Did I just interrupt?

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:39.416
(both laugh)

00:00:39.416 --> 00:00:42.263
- It's very famous for
serving braised goose.

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:43.668
So we're on our way to go eat some

00:00:43.668 --> 00:00:45.768
braised goose today for lunch.

00:00:45.768 --> 00:00:48.601
(uplifting music)

00:00:58.927 --> 00:01:00.253
The drive didn't take too long,

00:01:00.253 --> 00:01:01.895
we just arrived at the restaurant,

00:01:01.895 --> 00:01:03.756
and this is a fourth generation

00:01:03.756 --> 00:01:07.222
braised goose restaurant, and
it's one of these restaurants

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:10.184
that's just sort of expanded as it's grown

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:13.064
throughout the years and so
it's underneath the highway.

00:01:13.064 --> 00:01:14.881
And, you actually have to drive through

00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:17.725
the middle of the restaurant,
which I think is pretty cool,

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:21.892
and they have a dining room
on both sides of the street.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:33.821
You arrive to this restaurant,

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:36.988
and what's really cool about it is that

00:01:36.988 --> 00:01:41.173
there's a driveway, kind
of like a little road,

00:01:41.173 --> 00:01:42.538
right in the middle of this restaurant,

00:01:42.538 --> 00:01:44.384
and so you'll see some cars pulling up

00:01:44.384 --> 00:01:46.461
and people getting out and just entering

00:01:46.461 --> 00:01:48.016
the restaurant immediately.

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:52.053
It reminds me of, like, an
emission or like a mechanic,

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:53.970
or an emissions testing

00:01:54.904 --> 00:01:58.209
mechanic place where you
just drive in your car,

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.376
and then they check your car,
that's what it reminds me of.

00:02:03.404 --> 00:02:05.737
(chopping)

00:02:26.158 --> 00:02:28.109
A couple of the dishes have just arrived,

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:31.027
but what's really awesome
looking is the sauce.

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:33.084
Which, I think this is
the braised goose sauce.

00:02:33.084 --> 00:02:36.468
You can see, just full of
garlic and some yellow chilies,

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:37.974
and probably vinegar is what I'm guessing.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:39.824
I just gotta taste a little
piece of that garlic.

00:02:39.824 --> 00:02:42.315
Dwight is filming a video
too, so we've got two cameras

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:45.169
rolling, and we're both eating.

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.454
- We're definitely the
most annoying people

00:02:47.454 --> 00:02:50.254
in the restaurant, confirmed.

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:51.087
- Oh!

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.458
But what's really good about that sauce

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:57.625
is that they're using the Thai garlic.

00:02:58.605 --> 00:03:01.092
It's strong, but it's
mild at the same time.

00:03:01.092 --> 00:03:04.398
That's basically a vinegar-based sauce,

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:08.435
which is gonna go really well
together with the salty goose.

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:10.069
We ordered a couple of different dishes,

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:11.716
and the most famous thing this restaurant

00:03:11.716 --> 00:03:14.035
is known for is their braised goose,

00:03:14.035 --> 00:03:15.811
but the braised goose
is only served at lunch.

00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.689
They are also open at dinner,

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.554
but they serve more stir-fried
Chinese style dishes.

00:03:21.554 --> 00:03:23.311
So we got some braised goose,

00:03:23.311 --> 00:03:25.507
and then we also got another dish

00:03:25.507 --> 00:03:26.910
that you absolutely have to get.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.395
But I'm gonna start
with that braised goose.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.563
That is a beauty, just
a side of a goose here.

00:03:32.563 --> 00:03:35.962
You can see that, like,
marbling of the skin,

00:03:35.962 --> 00:03:40.003
and just that pool of flavorful juices.

00:03:40.003 --> 00:03:42.569
And there's some cilantro
on the top as well.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:43.893
And they do have the sauce,
but since I've already

00:03:43.893 --> 00:03:46.970
tasted the sauce, I think
I'm just gonna go ahead

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.235
and just taste the straight
piece of the goose,

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:51.445
without anything and really,

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:54.683
really let it absorb those juices.

00:03:54.683 --> 00:03:58.614
- [Dwight] It's just
extra fatty, extra juicy.

00:03:58.614 --> 00:03:59.920
Even when they're hanging in the window,

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.837
you can see them just
dripping with this juice.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.673
(laughs)

00:04:10.794 --> 00:04:11.627
- Oh yeah!

00:04:12.525 --> 00:04:13.692
That's insane.

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.552
It's on the salty side for flavor,

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:24.828
but you can taste the undertone
of the star anise in there.

00:04:24.828 --> 00:04:26.209
And then what I really
love about the goose

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:29.858
is that it has a little bit
of a muscular texture to it,

00:04:29.858 --> 00:04:32.120
which is completely contrasted by that

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.161
gelatinous-y skin on the top.

00:04:35.161 --> 00:04:39.328
This time I have to submerge
it into that garlic-y goodness,

00:04:40.582 --> 00:04:42.645
and I actually wanna take the chopsticks

00:04:42.645 --> 00:04:46.812
and actually put some of
that garlic on top of it.

00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:50.162
It's awesomely good.
- [Dwight] Confirmed?

00:04:50.162 --> 00:04:50.995
- Oh man,

00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:53.570
yeah,

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:55.070
confirmed delicious.

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.830
It's like at that stage
just before it's too salty

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:00.490
to the point where it's so addictive

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.080
and so good and so salty.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.054
Not over salty, but perfect.

00:05:06.054 --> 00:05:08.903
The next dish we got is Pad Mee Ka Han,

00:05:08.903 --> 00:05:13.092
and it comes in its own
little baking pot here,

00:05:13.092 --> 00:05:15.366
and there's Pad Mee, which
are egg noodles on the top,

00:05:15.366 --> 00:05:19.323
and then on the bottom
are braised goose feet

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:20.156
plus some garlic.

00:05:20.156 --> 00:05:23.739
This is one of their
signature dishes here.

00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:26.983
I wanna see what's underneath all this.

00:05:26.983 --> 00:05:30.400
So first, maybe take some of the noodles?

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.134
And I'm just assuming that these noodles

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:36.717
have just been saturated
with goose juices.

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.939
Oh, and there's mushrooms
down here, there's ginger.

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.141
- [Dwight] So, they've got all the spices

00:05:44.141 --> 00:05:45.787
and everything at the bottom.

00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:48.995
So I think the way they do
it is they cook all of that,

00:05:48.995 --> 00:05:51.289
and then they throw

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.456
the soaked noodles on top.

00:05:55.014 --> 00:05:56.375
So, once we get down to the bottom,

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:59.165
everybody will be able to
see a little bit better

00:05:59.165 --> 00:06:02.253
that all the flavor from
that garlic and the spices

00:06:02.253 --> 00:06:05.589
and those giant mushrooms
and everything has just been

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.352
absorbed by these goose feet.

00:06:08.352 --> 00:06:09.728
They're not like duck feet.

00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:13.330
They're webbed, right,
and they're extra big.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:16.018
So if you love feet at all,
if you love chicken feet,

00:06:16.018 --> 00:06:19.245
or duck feet, or anything,
this is like the ultimate.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:21.428
- [Mark] Looks like there's
some pork fat down there too.

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.794
For extra flavor.
- [Dwight] Yeah. Oh.

00:06:23.794 --> 00:06:26.022
- [Mark] They know what
they're doing here.

00:06:26.022 --> 00:06:26.885
- [Dwight] I don't even
think you're supposed

00:06:26.885 --> 00:06:28.536
to eat all of that stuff,
that's just there...

00:06:28.536 --> 00:06:29.907
- [Mark] Here's a goose foot.

00:06:29.907 --> 00:06:31.130
- [Dwight] To be absorbed.

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.812
- [Mark] There's a lot of
delicious things going on

00:06:32.812 --> 00:06:35.719
in that pot, but I gotta start with this.

00:06:35.719 --> 00:06:37.764
This webbed foot.

00:06:37.764 --> 00:06:41.595
Rather than a chicken foot,
this has a lot more meat,

00:06:41.595 --> 00:06:45.262
or a lot more material
that you can gnaw on.

00:06:51.564 --> 00:06:55.257
You do wanna take out
all the little bones.

00:06:55.257 --> 00:06:56.532
- (laughs)

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:57.641
Come again?

00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:00.052
(laughs)

00:07:00.052 --> 00:07:02.276
- Yeah, that is very gelatinous.

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:05.601
You can really taste, like,
a black pepper flavor to it.

00:07:05.601 --> 00:07:09.101
And I still got one more bone in my mouth.

00:07:12.637 --> 00:07:14.139
Unlike chicken feet, which I wouldn't

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:17.273
say are my favorite because
they basically just offer

00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:20.801
a couple bites of, like,
that padding material,

00:07:20.801 --> 00:07:22.748
goose feet, on the other hand,

00:07:22.748 --> 00:07:24.979
and these particularly, are awesome.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:26.598
You do have to really
like the kinda, like,

00:07:26.598 --> 00:07:28.822
the gelatinous-y,

00:07:28.822 --> 00:07:30.072
gooey textures.

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.804
But if you can enjoy
that kind of a texture,

00:07:33.804 --> 00:07:37.226
the flavor on them and just that fattiness

00:07:37.226 --> 00:07:39.914
and that gnawing on the little bones,

00:07:39.914 --> 00:07:44.105
and digging off that
little bits of the web,

00:07:44.105 --> 00:07:45.480
it's really really good.

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.126
And that, like, spice
profile that they're using

00:07:49.126 --> 00:07:51.876
in their braised juices and sauce

00:07:52.748 --> 00:07:54.588
is just absolutely awesome.

00:07:54.588 --> 00:07:56.104
Now I gotta taste some of those noodles.

00:07:56.104 --> 00:07:59.138
And the noodles not only
have the goose juices,

00:07:59.138 --> 00:08:01.379
but also that pork at
the bottom of the pot,

00:08:01.379 --> 00:08:04.655
as well as ginger and
garlic, and some other,

00:08:04.655 --> 00:08:07.072
probably secret, ingredients.

00:08:11.886 --> 00:08:12.719
Woah.

00:08:14.227 --> 00:08:15.804
Those noodles are amazing.

00:08:15.804 --> 00:08:17.304
- [Dwight] Mm-hmm.

00:08:18.187 --> 00:08:20.767
- They're so soft, you can actually

00:08:20.767 --> 00:08:23.805
feel, like, the oils and flavors

00:08:23.805 --> 00:08:26.066
just filled into the noodles.

00:08:26.066 --> 00:08:29.116
We also got a big soup
here which is, I think,

00:08:29.116 --> 00:08:33.221
a steamed soup with bitter
melon and See Khrong Muu,

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.933
which is pork ribs, I think.

00:08:35.933 --> 00:08:37.766
And I love bitter melon,
especially when they're

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:41.099
like these tender piece of bitter melon.

00:08:43.283 --> 00:08:45.866
I'm gonna put this on to my rice.

00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:50.033
Okay, and then maybe add a
pork rib in there as well.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.077
Is this supposed to be eaten
with any sauce, you think?

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:56.979
Okay, and I will reach in for that.

00:08:56.979 --> 00:08:57.887
(Mark gasps)

00:08:57.887 --> 00:08:58.720
- [Mark] Oh!

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.838
That just completely falls off the bone.

00:09:00.838 --> 00:09:02.318
Oh, that's beautiful.

00:09:02.318 --> 00:09:05.940
And then, take it with
some of that bitter melon.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.607
(Dwight laughs)

00:09:11.857 --> 00:09:13.888
That bitter melon just
disintegrates in your mouth.

00:09:13.888 --> 00:09:15.698
And it's just so soft and tender,

00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:17.567
and it's not really that bitter,

00:09:17.567 --> 00:09:21.567
but it definitely has a
very porky flavor to it.

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:24.762
That is very porky, and that just was a

00:09:24.762 --> 00:09:27.211
very pleasant bitterness to it.

00:09:27.211 --> 00:09:30.334
We've eaten all the noodles
and most of the feet,

00:09:30.334 --> 00:09:31.771
but there's some goodies down below here.

00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:35.157
I'm gonna grab one of those mushrooms.

00:09:35.157 --> 00:09:39.240
Oh, and I got a noodle
attached to this mushroom.

00:09:43.326 --> 00:09:45.493
Those mushrooms are ridiculous.

00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:48.900
It almost has the same
texture as the feet.

00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:52.466
It's gelatinous, and it's
just filled with the flavor.

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:55.280
I can really taste
ginger in that mushroom.

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.546
We just finished with this meal.

00:09:56.546 --> 00:09:58.879
That was fantastically good.

00:10:00.857 --> 00:10:02.031
What I really liked about the goose

00:10:02.031 --> 00:10:05.277
is that it's on a saltier side
rather than the sweet side.

00:10:05.277 --> 00:10:06.677
Actually, I don't even know if it

00:10:06.677 --> 00:10:08.205
really has any sweetness to it.

00:10:08.205 --> 00:10:10.211
But you can really taste the undertone of

00:10:10.211 --> 00:10:13.490
secret herbs and spices
that they've braised,

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:15.857
that juice that they braised the goose in.

00:10:15.857 --> 00:10:17.192
Really, really good.

00:10:17.192 --> 00:10:19.420
And then also the
highlight of any meal here

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.003
is that goose feet,

00:10:22.176 --> 00:10:25.009
kinda hot pot pan, all in one pan.

00:10:26.277 --> 00:10:28.737
Even if feet don't sound that good to you,

00:10:28.737 --> 00:10:31.031
you should definitely try
it because they are amazing.

00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:33.833
And what I didn't notice at
the beginning of eating it

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:36.581
is that they included
a lot of cilantro roots

00:10:36.581 --> 00:10:38.719
which in Thai are called Rak Pak Chee,

00:10:38.719 --> 00:10:40.648
and that was giving a lot
of flavor to this dish.

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:42.944
There's a lot of black pepper corns.

00:10:42.944 --> 00:10:46.327
There were some pork fat flavoring it,

00:10:46.327 --> 00:10:47.984
as well as a lot of ginger.

00:10:47.984 --> 00:10:49.879
And then this is just a classic place.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:52.849
I love how the master is up there,

00:10:52.849 --> 00:10:55.007
just slicing and dicing

00:10:55.007 --> 00:10:56.908
that goose up just

00:10:56.908 --> 00:10:58.241
remarkably well.

00:10:59.275 --> 00:11:01.783
He's a true expert, and
he just de-bones it!

00:11:01.783 --> 00:11:03.687
He de-bones it all within, like,

00:11:03.687 --> 00:11:07.512
just not, like, really
fast, but just graceful.

00:11:07.512 --> 00:11:10.888
He's very graceful at chopping up geese.

00:11:10.888 --> 00:11:15.314
For fantastic and legendary
braised goose in Bangkok,

00:11:15.314 --> 00:11:17.309
this is a great restaurant.

00:11:17.309 --> 00:11:19.659
And they even have some snack stalls

00:11:19.659 --> 00:11:22.268
right outside the restaurant.

00:11:22.268 --> 00:11:23.768
Ying is now buying

00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:25.833
some Makam,

00:11:25.833 --> 00:11:28.026
or some Khanoms over here.

00:11:28.026 --> 00:11:29.216
- [Mark] Which one is this Ying?

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:30.374
Khanom
- [Ying] Khanom Tian

00:11:30.374 --> 00:11:33.124
Khanom Tian.
- [Mark] Khanom Tian.

00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:37.092
In a little pyramid shape,

00:11:37.092 --> 00:11:40.175
wrapped in a banana leaf and steamed.

00:11:47.777 --> 00:11:49.610
Oh yeah, that's gooey.

00:11:51.791 --> 00:11:55.541
And you can feel the
oils coming out of this.

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:01.893
You can really smell the banana leaf,

00:12:01.893 --> 00:12:04.726
which has been embedded into this.

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.948
Mm, okay, I have had this before.

00:12:11.948 --> 00:12:13.531
It has kind of like

00:12:14.494 --> 00:12:18.089
a grainy, bean-y texture on the inside,

00:12:18.089 --> 00:12:20.900
and then on the outside
it is, like, very sticky.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.546
And then also, I forgot
that there is a little

00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:24.669
bit of black pepper in here.

00:12:24.669 --> 00:12:28.836
So you can taste a little bit
of a pepper flavor as well.

00:12:31.003 --> 00:12:32.237
That is a very interesting snack

00:12:32.237 --> 00:12:35.541
because it's a little bit sweet,

00:12:35.541 --> 00:12:37.523
but then that contrasts
with the black pepper.

00:12:37.523 --> 00:12:38.675
And now that I keep on eating it,

00:12:38.675 --> 00:12:42.592
you can actually taste
the black pepper sort of

00:12:43.535 --> 00:12:45.329
numbing the tongue.

00:12:45.329 --> 00:12:46.997
What'd you think of that goose, Dwight?

00:12:46.997 --> 00:12:49.077
- Oh man, I loved it, as always.

00:12:49.077 --> 00:12:50.277
This is a great place.

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:52.454
If you're in Bangkok,
it's worth coming over

00:12:52.454 --> 00:12:53.287
to Chua Kim Heng.

00:12:53.287 --> 00:12:54.314
This is not the only
thing to eat over here.

00:12:54.314 --> 00:12:57.308
There's a great set of
restaurants in this area,

00:12:57.308 --> 00:13:00.024
so you can really just
come over here and explore.

00:13:00.024 --> 00:13:01.739
- Thank you all very much
for watching this video.

00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:04.525
Please remember to give it a
thumbs up if you enjoyed it.

00:13:04.525 --> 00:13:07.193
Also Dwight is making a video as well.

00:13:07.193 --> 00:13:08.026
- Maybe.

00:13:08.026 --> 00:13:09.130
(laughs)

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.457
- I think.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:12.729
I will link it below if he does,

00:13:12.729 --> 00:13:15.495
and thank you all very much for watching,

00:13:15.495 --> 00:13:18.456
and I will see you on the next video.

00:13:18.456 --> 00:13:21.373
