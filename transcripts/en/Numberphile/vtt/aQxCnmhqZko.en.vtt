00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
Right, Brady, I'm gonna give you a mathematical gift.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.400
I'm not give you many mathematical gifts, I give you a very special one today.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.370
And, ehh now, to make it extra special, I often ask people when I do this.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.440
It's one of my party tricks.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.700
Er...their age. But that feels a little impersonal.

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.760
So, would you wanna give me a...err...arbitrary number between 21 and 65?

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.780
What would you? What would you like?

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.420
Brady: 42.   Matt: 42!? Ahh, nerd!

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.280
Ok! Right, so 42...42...42...40...

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.640
I guess smaller...

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.300
I guess here is...2.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.520
Right...there's more I'm just...I'm starting with those digits.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.760
I'm gonna put a 5 in a...

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.920
There I'm gonna put a 3...ahh...actually I put a 3 there and 6 there.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.060
I'm gonna change it as I go.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.980
That's gonna be a 9, that's gonna be a 10, 22, 23, 24, and 12!

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.540
And what I've done for you there,

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.280
if you err...double check all the numbers in the top row

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.460
would add up to 42, if you go through and check those.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.440
The second row would add up to 42.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.380
And all the columns add up to 42, the diagonals 42, the opposite...

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.060
I mean all 4 in the corner add up to 42,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.380
each 4 in the corner...it's a magic square.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.420
I love magic square, one of the reasons I love this a lot, and to they that...that...

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.700
For you Brady, that's a gift magic square based on the number 42.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.860
Matt: What can you think?  Brady: Now, make one for...58.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.220
58, ok, this number of 58, this one is gonna be wildly different...at 58.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.120
So, I'm gonna put a 5 there, I'm gonna put a 4 there...

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.320
I'm gonna put a 3 there, I'm gonna put a 6 there,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm gonna put a 1 there, 8, and that one would be 38, and then...

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.820
39, and then 40, and there you are!

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.480
Incredible amount of mental arithmetic later I've managed to...

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.140
You look unimpressed, I gotta be honest.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.520
Brady: What I am... the first time I was impressed...

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.900
now I think maybe you just using a pro-forma...

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.300
Maybe, maybe all I'm doing is if you gave me the number "n",

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.220
then I'm going through, and I'm doing these all exactly the same every single time,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.540
and so I fill in those...

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.960
And this is easy to remember, this is the multiple of 9.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240
fifty-four, thirty-six, eighteen, seventy-two

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.540
Then remember I've put 9 down there, 10, 11, 12...

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:28.460
and then I do n-21, I do n-20, I do n-19, and I do n-18.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.700
And that is a magic square!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.500
The problem, of course,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.480
and the reason they get a bit suspicious for big numbers

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.260
is you could look at this one here, and you go,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.600
"Wait they're all quite small, what's this?"

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.480
What's these massive 30s and 40s going on?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.840
They'll be a little bit unimpressed.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.010
So, even though you gave me 58, out of no where,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.020
you look at this and be a little bit suspicious.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.460
Brady: So, that's why age is often good.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.780
Matt: Age is often good,

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.540
cause they tend to be in around the 30s and 40s is perfect,

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.840
anything too big starts to go awry...

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.280
Brady: What if they give you small? What if they give you like 8?

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.000
Matt: Actually, that's why I said between 21...

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.120
So, age is very good, cause then, if someone said 21, you'll have 0 there,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.220
which I'm kind of ok, whether you don't mind 0, it goes 0, 1, 2, 3,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.020
anything smaller you get negative numbers.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.580
So, the square still works, if you gave me a tiny number,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.680
so, if you gave me something like emm "8",

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.360
then I would have, in that spot there, I have to subtract 21 off 8,

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.220
then I have a -13 hanging out there.

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.720
If I gave you a million?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.200
If you gave me a million, you'll have massive massive numbers...
