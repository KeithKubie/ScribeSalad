00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.950
- [Instructor] Let's now
think a little bit more

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:04.570
about how we might
model population growth,

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:06.070
and as we do so, we're gonna become

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.010
a little bit more familiar
with the types of formulas

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.390
that you might see in an
AP Biology formula sheet.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.900
So in a previous video,
we introduced the idea

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.030
of per capita growth rate of a population,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.800
and we used the letter r for that.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.610
And so let's say that the
per capita growth rate

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.080
for a population is 0.2.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:29.850
That means that on average,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.350
for every one individual
in that population,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.100
a year later, it would have
grown by 20%, by two-tenths.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.920
So for every one, you would
now have 1.2 of that population

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.120
a year later.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.130
Now, as we mentioned, many populations,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.810
or the ones that reproduced sexually,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.030
you'd need at least two,
a male and a female,

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.180
but there's populations of certain things

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.010
that can just reproduce on their own.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.910
They can just bud, or they can divide,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.880
if we're talking about
especially unicellular organisms.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.160
And from this notion, we
can get a related notion,

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.590
which is our maximum per capita
growth rate of a population

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.380
and let me just write that there.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.610
You could view this as
your per capita growth rate

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.120
if the population is
not limited in any way,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.030
if there's ample resources.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.360
Water, food, land, territory,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.600
whatever that population needs to grow,

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.760
but that still is talking
about per capita growth rate

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.980
of population, we're just viewing as,

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.380
this is the unfettered
one, this is the maximum.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.680
And from that, we can set up
an exponential growth equation,

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.700
and we've seen this in other videos

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.140
where the rate of change of our population

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.860
with respect to time, N is our population,

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.750
so dN dt is our rate
of change of population

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.220
with respect to time.

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.580
Or our population growth
rate right over here,

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:47.480
let me write this down.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.780
Population growth rate.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.520
If we're dealing with a population

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.150
that in no way is being
limited by its ecosystem,

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.870
which in reality is not realistic,

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.340
at some point you would be.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.370
Well then, the rate of
growth of population

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.820
is going to be your maximum per capita

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.473
growth rate of population,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.250
times your population itself.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.460
And we could see it set
up a little table here

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.390
to see how these would
relate to each other,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.400
so let me do that, let me set up a table.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.190
And so let's think about
what the rate of change

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.880
of population will be, our
population growth rate,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.450
for certain populations.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.930
So let's think about
what it's going to be,

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.020
when our population is 100.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.690
When our population is 500,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.890
and when our population is 900.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.230
So, given these populations,

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.570
what would be your population
growth rate for each of them?

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.570
Pause this video and try to answer that.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:53.270
Well, when our population is 100,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:54.610
our population growth rate

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.650
is just going to be 0.2 times that.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.130
So 0.2, let me write this down,

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.930
this is just going to be, dN
dt is just going to be 0.2,

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.760
our maximum per capita
growth rate of population

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.700
times our population, times 100,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.220
which is equal to 20.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.040
So we're going to grow per year by 20

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.470
when our population is 100.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:20.740
Now what about when our population is 500?

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.530
What is going to be our
population growth rate?

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.210
Pause the video again
and try to answer that.

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.310
Well, once again, we just take our maximum

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.488
per capita growth rate and
multiply it times our population,

00:03:30.488 --> 00:03:35.488
so .2 times 500, our population
growth rate is now 100.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:37.800
If we're talking about bunnies,

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.030
and if our time is in years,

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.840
this would be 100 bunnies per year,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.950
or 100 individuals per year.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.750
And let's think about it
when our population is 900.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.360
What's our population growth rate then?

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.160
Pause the video again.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.140
Alright, well we're just
gonna take 0.2 times 900,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.890
so it is going to be 180
individuals per year.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.880
Now, as I just mentioned,

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.240
this is talking about a
somewhat unrealistic situation

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.650
where a population can
just grow and grow and grow

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:05.880
and never be limited in any way.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.360
We know that land is
limited, food is limited,

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.960
water is limited.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.600
And so, there's this notion
of a natural carrying capacity

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.200
of a given population
in a given environment.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.630
And to describe that,
we'll use the letter K.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.070
And so let's say, for the organisms

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.250
that we're studying here,
let's say they're bunnies,

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.870
and they're bunnies on a
relatively small island,

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.940
let's say that the
natural carrying capacity

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.420
for that island is 1000.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.600
The the island really can't
support more than 1000 bunnies.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.340
So how would we change this
exponential growth equation

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.110
right over here, exponential,

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.273
to reflect that?

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.840
Well, what mathematicians
and biologists have done

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.090
is they've modified this,

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.020
they multiplied this times the factor,

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.840
to get us what's known as logistic growth.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.273
Logistic growth.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.993
So this is exponential growth,

00:05:02.955 --> 00:05:05.560
and what we're gonna now talk
about is logistic growth.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.220
And what they do is they start
with the exponential growth,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.390
so my population growth rate

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.390
you could view as your maximum
per capita growth rate,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.350
times your population, so
that's exactly what we had

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.890
right over here, but then they
multiplied that by a factor

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:24.690
so that this thing slows down

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:27.290
the closer and closer we get
to the carrying capacity.

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.410
And the factor that they add is,

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:34.410
your carrying capacity
minus your population,

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:38.950
over your carrying capacity.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.350
Now let's see if this
makes intuitive sense.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:43.170
So let's set up another table here.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:45.270
And I'll do it with the same values.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.850
So let's say we have N,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.370
so our population, what's going
to be our population growth

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.440
when our population's 100, when it's 500,

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.420
and when it's 900?

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.580
So I encourage you, pause this video,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:02.983
and figure out what dN dt
is at these various times.

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:06.160
Well, at 100, it's going to be,

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:07.430
I'll do this one, I'll write it out,

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.430
it's going to be 0.2 times 100,

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.710
times the carrying capacity is 1000,

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.367
so it's gonna be 1000 minus 100,

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.120
all of that over 1000.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.110
So this is 900 over 1000,
this is going to be 0.9.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.110
And then 0.2 times 100
is 20, so 20 times 0.9,

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.080
this is going to be equal to 18.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:41.420
So it's a little bit lower,

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.070
it's being slowed down a little
bit, but it's pretty close.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.130
Now let's see what happens
when we get to N equals 500.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.150
Pause this video and figure what dN dt,

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:51.320
our population growth rate,
would be at that time.

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320
So in this case, it's
going to be 0.2 times 500,

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:59.490
times 500, times this factor here,

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.120
which is now going to be 1000

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.370
minus 500, that's our population now,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.350
minus 500, all of that over 1000.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.890
Now what's this going to be?

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:14.860
This is 100, which we had there,

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.500
but it's going to be
multiplied by 500 over 1000,

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.930
which is .5.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.730
So we're only going to grow half as fast

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:22.130
as we were in this situation.

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.260
'Cause once again, we don't have

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:25.370
an infinite amount of resources here.

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:29.600
So this is going to be 100 times .5,

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.660
which is equal to 50.

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:34.800
And then if you look at
this scenario over here,

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.860
when our population is 900, what is dN dt?

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:38.960
Pause the video again.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.537
Well, it is going to be 0.2 times 900,

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.330
which is 180, times this factor,

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:53.330
which is going to be 1000 minus 900,

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:59.520
all of that over 1000.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.400
So now this factor's going to be,

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.900
100 over 1000, which is .1, 0.1.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.190
This part right over here is,

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:10.530
this part right over here is 180.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.770
180 times 1/10th is
going to be equal to 18.

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:16.130
So now our population
growth has slowed down.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:17.160
Why is that happening?

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:18.910
Here, your population rate,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.730
the rate of growth is growing
and growing and growing,

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.020
because the more bunnies or
whatever types of individuals

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.100
you have, there's just more to reproduce,

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.310
and they're just gonna
keep growing exponentially.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:28.990
But here, they're
getting closer and closer

00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:31.840
to the carrying capacity of
whatever environment they're at.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.700
And so at 900, they're awfully close,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:34.820
so now you're gonna have some bunnies

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:35.653
that are going hungry,

00:08:35.653 --> 00:08:37.620
and maybe they're not in the
mood to reproduce as much,

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:39.220
or maybe they're getting killed,

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.340
or they're dying of, this
is very unpleasant thinking,

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.520
they're dying of starvation,

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.470
or they're not able to
get water, dehydration.

00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:48.550
Who knows what might be happening?

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:51.600
And we could also think
about this visually.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.350
If we were to make a quick
graph right over here,

00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.720
where if this is time,

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.800
and if this is population,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.850
our exponential growth right here

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.610
would describe something
that looks like this.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:06.920
So, for exponential growth, our population

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.900
will grow like this.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.960
The more our population
is, the faster it grows,

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.260
the more it is, the faster it grows,

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.490
the more it is, the faster it grows,

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.390
and it'll just keep
going forever until it,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.110
just, there's no limit in theory.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.870
And obviously, we know
that's not realistic.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:22.920
Now with logistic growth,
I'll do this in red,

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.660
in logistic growth, in
the beginning it looks

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.940
a lot like exponential growth,

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.020
it's just a little bit slower.

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.970
But then as the population
gets higher and higher,

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.880
it gets a good bit slower,

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.880
and it's limited by the
natural carrying capacity

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.900
of the environment for that population.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.020
So K would be right over there.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:46.000
It would asymptote up to it,
but not quite approach it.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.270
And if you wanted to get the
limit, what would happen?

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:49.850
Well, what happens at a population

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.740
of 1000 in this circumstance?

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.150
Well then, this factor right
over here just becomes zero,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.690
so your population at that point

00:09:57.690 --> 00:10:00.540
just wouldn't grow anymore if
you were to even get there.
