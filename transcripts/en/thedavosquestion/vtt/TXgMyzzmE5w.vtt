Ahmet: Hello [Inaudible], I am Ahmet Uzumcu,
the Turkish ambassador for the nations in

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.580
Geneva.
I am asked to say a few words. So I believe

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.550
that the international community should focus
on the resolution of original conflicts in

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.160
2008,
beginning with the Middle East conflict.

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.060
I hope that a peaceful environment will prevail
in the world in 2008 if we can redouble our

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.630
efforts.
