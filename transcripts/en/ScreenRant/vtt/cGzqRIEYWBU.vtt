00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.370
There are some actors who play a character
so well, it almost seems the role was tailor-made

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.309
for them. Casting is a lengthy process and
finding the right fit in creating a memorable

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:20.311
character can be a laborious task, one that
may require a few test runs. Here are 10 Iconic

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:25.099
Movie Roles that were originally to be played
by other Actors.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:29.279
Tom Hanks, Jerry Maguire
The 1996 Romantic dramedy from director Cameron

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.850
Crowe, Jerry Maguire, is the film that made
a breakout star of Renee Zellweger, earned

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.910
Cuba Gooding Jr. an Academy Award and informed
audiences that the human head weighs eight

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.040
pounds. Before Tom Cruise memorably portrayed
the sports agent who had a change of heart,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.570
Tom Hanks was set to star. Five years before
the film was shot, Hanks had agreed to play

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.400
the lead. Hanks wasn’t crazy about the script
and he thought Jerry and Dorothy getting married

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.690
didn’t make sense. Four years and a final
script later, Hanks had won two Oscars and

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.070
wanted to direct. There were too many objectionable
factors to continue with Hanks. He left and

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.280
ended up making his own film, That Thing You
Do.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.500
Molly Ringwald, Vivian from Pretty Woman
The 1980s belonged to Molly Ringwald. The

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
redheaded teen was the sweet girl next door
with her unassuming beauty and heightened

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.210
angst. She was filmmaker John Hughes muse
for years as she starred in his films Sixteen

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.469
Candles, The Breakfast Club and Pretty in
Pink. As her place in 80s pop culture came

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.090
to a close, the 90s could have started off
with a hit by once again playing an unlikely

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.130
object of a rich man’s affection, when she
was in talks to play Vivian in 1990’s Pretty

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.359
Woman. Director Garry Marshall thought the
role would be an interesting departure from

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.819
Ringwald’s previous roles. Ringwald was
just never satisfied with the script as she

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:35.670
felt that the content was not fitting for
her image. Years later Ringwald commented

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.140
on her decision as being one of her dumbest
career moves.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.710
Tom Selleck, Indiana Jones
Harrison Ford is an actor who exudes confidence

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.250
and endless charm which is exactly why he
perfectly embodied two of the coolest film

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.389
characters ever, Han Solo and Indiana Jones.
Another actor who happens to possess those

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:56.899
qualities is the original choice for Indiana
Jones, Tom Selleck. After the Star Wars films,

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:01.149
George Lucas who wrote 1981’s Raiders of
the Lost Ark was not especially keen on casting

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.130
Harrison Ford in another one of his films.
He asked Steven Spielberg to cast the mustachioed

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.140
Tom Selleck instead. Everything was set and
all involved were excited to see Selleck on

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.590
the big screen as the archaeologist adventurer.
Timing was just not on their side as Selleck’s

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.080
pilot for the new detective show Magnum P.I.
had just been picked up by CBS. He was unable

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.450
to get out of contract for the show and since
he was the star of both projects, there was

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:30.790
no way to work around it. This led him to
exit the film and win an Emmy instead.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.420
Tom Cruise, Iron Man
When an actor has a career as long lasting

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.830
and prolific as Tom Cruise, it’s only natural
that there would be a few roles that came

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.510
his way first. Along with Footloose, Speed
and A Beautiful Mind, Cruise has tossed his

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.400
hat in many iconic roles from the last three
decades. One of these near misses was Tony

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.860
Stark in 2008’s Iron Man. Cruise was attached
to star as the cocky millionaire genius for

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.140
years starting in the late 90s. As Marvel
was beginning to make serious moves in releasing

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.420
their Superhero films in 2004, Cruise was
still in talks with playing the role. Even

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.640
after years of interest, Cruise just couldn’t
wrap his head around Iron Man working as a

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.470
film and decided to give up on it completely.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.210
Leonardo DiCaprio, Dirk Diggler from Boogie
Nights

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:13.150
Dirk Diggler is the young aspiring porn star
at the center of Paul Thomas Anderson’s

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.010
1997 film Boogie Nights. He goes from being
a high school dropout with a rare appendage

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.430
to the biggest name in the industry, then
to a has-been and finally a comeback kid,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.100
all within the span of a two and a half hour
feature. The person who was originally cast

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.570
to play the complicated mess was Leonardo
DiCaprio. It was 1996 and the actor had just

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:33.680
finished Baz Luhrmann's dreamy and romantic,
Romeo and Juliet. His excitement for playing

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.260
such a gritty and adult character overtook
his interest in playing in another film that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.680
was looking for its lead, Titanic. According
to DiCaprio, it was the casting of Kate Winslet

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.650
that swayed him toward the James Cameron's
big budget flick as he initially had no interest

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.010
in starring in another romantic drama at the
time.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.370
John Travolta Forrest Gump
Forrest Gump, the slow-witted man who just

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.650
happens to always be in the right place at
the right time in history, is one of Tom Hank’s

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.840
most beloved roles but it almost wasn't his.
Director Robert Zemeckis initially wanted

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.300
John Travolta to play the lead in the film
adaptation of Winston Groom’s 1986 novel.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.440
It was Travolta who would step into those
worn running shoes and share his philosophical

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.010
thoughts on boxed chocolate. However, Travolta
decided he wasn’t interested after all,

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:18.910
and the role went to Hanks which gave him
his second Academy Award in a row. Travolta

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.680
admits that passing on the part was one of
his biggest mistakes but at least he had an

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.010
iconic role in Pulp Fiction which was released
only a few months after Forrest Gump.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.701
Will Smith as Neo from The Matrix
It was the Fresh Prince of Bel Air who was

00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:34.320
going to have to choose between the red pill
and the blue pill, or at least that was original

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.600
plan when Will Smith was set to star in the
1999 Wachowski brothers science fiction action

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.750
film, The Matrix. Apparently, Smith was not
completely sure how to play Neo nor was he

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:47.170
sure what the film was going to be which caused
him to worry about taking it on. After having&nbsp;few

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:50.390
meetings with the directors to understand
their vision, he was still unsure about the

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.190
whole endeavor leading him to back out of
the film. Smith does not regret walking away

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.610
from Neo, as he believed no one could play
the role like Keanu Reeves.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.990
Chris Farley, Shrek
Shrek is the lovable Ogre who just wants to

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.970
be left alone in his swamp-front home and
frighten townspeople for his own entertainment,

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.000
in the 2001 DreamWorks hit. Audiences are
familiar with the Scottish-accented Mike Myers

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.090
as the title character but it was actually
the late Chris Farley who originated the role.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.280
In 1997, the comedian was on a roll with multiple
films after departing from Saturday Night

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.560
Live. He had recorded 90 percent of the film
before dying from a drug overdose. Farley’s

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.320
version of Shrek was much different as it
was a story of a teenage Ogre who dreamed

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.160
of becoming a knight rather than taking over
the family business. Due to his death, the

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.130
filmmakers scrambled to finish it until fellow
SNL actor Mike Myers took over and made it

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.400
his own.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.820
Johnny Depp in Mr. and Mrs. Smith
The 2005 Doug Liman action comedy Mr. and

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.580
Mrs. Smith is not only known for its massive
box office success, it was also the film that

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.440
introduced Brad Pitt to Angelina Jolie. Things
would be much different if the Mr. Smith in

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.550
question was played by Johnny Depp, the actor
originally cast in the role. Depp was attached

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.260
to the role of the contract killer for some
time. Once production was underway, Depp backed

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.930
out at the last minute claiming he felt overworked
from all of the productions he had recently

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.460
completed. The role went to Pitt but Jolie
and Depp did end up working together five

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.050
years later&nbsp;in The Tourist.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.250
Gwyneth Paltrow as Rose from Titanic
Titanic sits in second place as the biggest-box

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.850
office hit in film history. The James Cameron
Spectacle earned countless accolades and was

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.130
regarded as a romance for the ages when it
was released in December of 1997. Before Kate

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.960
Winslet took on the role of Rose DeWitt-Bukater,
James Cameron had another beautiful young

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:28.880
actress in mind for the role, Gwyneth Paltrow.
Paltrow had recently appeared in films like

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.970
David Fincher’s Seven and the film adaptation
of Jane Austen’s Emma, when Cameron offered

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:36.760
her the role. She decided to pass in favor
of smaller films like the British romantic

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.700
comedy, Sliding Doors. She went on to make
another Academy Award winning film Shakespeare

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.400
in Love a year later and the role of Rose
deservedly went to Winslet.
