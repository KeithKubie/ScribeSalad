00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:10.650
DORINA ARELLANO: Hi, I'm
Dorina from Talks at Google.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm very happy to welcome
Kate McKinnon and Mila Kunis

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.913
for "The Spy Who Dumped Me."

00:00:15.913 --> 00:00:18.378
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:24.787 --> 00:00:26.759
[CHATTER]

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.745
MILA KUNIS: Oh, no.

00:00:27.745 --> 00:00:30.230
KATE MCKINNON: Oh.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.439
DORINA ARELLANO:
Welcome to Google.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.720
KATE MCKINNON: You all came.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.870
Thank you all.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.661
MILA KUNIS: How are
you reaching the floor?

00:00:39.661 --> 00:00:42.355
If I sit back, I
can't reach the floor.

00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:44.480
DORINA ARELLANO: Are we
all going to sit like that?

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:44.900
MILA KUNIS: How do you sit?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.525
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:00:45.525 --> 00:00:45.850
KATE MCKINNON: Yeah.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.100
MILA KUNIS: These chairs are--

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:47.949
there we go.

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:48.740
KATE MCKINNON: Wow.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.270
You all left your desk.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.050
I'm sorry.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.009
You're right.

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:52.550
You're right.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.420
Oh, you're a lady.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.390
OK.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.350
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.695
Oh.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:00:59.320
MILA KUNIS: Oh.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.770
Well, my voice travels.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:01.340
It's fine.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.060
DORINA ARELLANO: Thank you.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.890
OK.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.360
So, thanks for being here.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.920
I can't see Kate, Mila.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.180
MILA KUNIS: Well,
otherwise I look like this,

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.780
because I'm short.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.980
KATE MCKINNON: Hi.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.652
DORINA ARELLANO: I
know, and it's OK.

00:01:10.652 --> 00:01:11.360
MILA KUNIS: Fine.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.300
I'll be up here.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.827
Go ahead.

00:01:13.827 --> 00:01:14.660
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.920
So we got to see the trailer.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.230
But can you tell us a
little bit about the movie,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.980
just so they know?

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.520
KATE MCKINNON: OK.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.210
I can.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.440
I can.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.590
It's two regular
gal best friends

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.200
who become embroiled in
an international espionage

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.490
adventure, for which
they're not prepared.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.450
MILA KUNIS: That's
a good one liner.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.950
That's it.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.190
KATE MCKINNON: Yeah.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.690
That's it.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.844
DORINA ARELLANO: That's it.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:36.010
KATE MCKINNON: Chaos ensues.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.880
Hijinks ensues.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.630
Friendship ensues.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.452
MILA KUNIS: Hilarity ensues.

00:01:39.452 --> 00:01:40.660
KATE MCKINNON: Shoes enshoe--

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.840
MILA KUNIS: Ensue.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.620
KATE MCKINNON: Shoes enshoes?

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:42.550
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:43.000
DORINA ARELLANO: That's true.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.110
I saw it yesterday.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.750
They're not lying.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.000
OK, so, the movie
does a pretty good job

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.284
of showcasing female characters
that are allowed to be human,

00:01:52.284 --> 00:01:54.450
which is awesome, because
you don't get to see that.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.830
KATE MCKINNON: Wow.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.788
DORINA ARELLANO: Right?

00:01:55.788 --> 00:01:56.710
Isn't that great?

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.460
Because you don't get to
see that a lot in comedy.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:59.350
So it's really nice.

00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:03.060
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.290
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.900
You are correct.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.240
Yes.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.888
Yes.

00:02:04.888 --> 00:02:05.296
DORINA ARELLANO: Thank you.

00:02:05.296 --> 00:02:06.520
MILA KUNIS: You're welcome.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.353
DORINA ARELLANO: So,
this is especially nice

00:02:08.353 --> 00:02:09.400
to see in comedy.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.657
Is that what drew
you guys to the part?

00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.240
Is that kind of what
you were thinking

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.180
about throughout the
filming of this movie?

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.230
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.250
I mean, I-- no, it did.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.570
I do one film a year because
I have kids and family.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.310
And so it limits the amount of
work that I can do out of town.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.080
I was working on
a different film.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.490
This project came along.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.960
I was like, I can't do it,
because it would take me out

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.206
for six months, and would
uproot my whole family.

00:02:34.206 --> 00:02:36.080
They're like, yes, but
Kate McKinnon's in it,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.210
and I was like, oh, [MUTED].

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.810
So I read the script.

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.550
And then-- that's--

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.400
yeah.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.280
And what honestly drew me
to it was the relationship

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.591
between two best friends being
incredibly grounded, incredibly

00:02:52.591 --> 00:02:53.090
genuine.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.256
Kate talks about this a lot.

00:02:54.256 --> 00:02:59.054
But in so many spy movies, the
two characters have a fight.

00:02:59.054 --> 00:03:01.220
And that's the catalyst for
like-- they have a fight

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.428
and you're like, but will
they ever get back together

00:03:03.428 --> 00:03:05.490
and solve the world's problems?

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.920
So we don't have that.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.290
Like, women, or people in
real life, don't always fight.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.680
And so having that
resolved doesn't always

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.706
resolve other issues.

00:03:13.706 --> 00:03:15.080
So I really was
drawn to the fact

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.410
that our characters were simply
friends on a crazy journey

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.310
together.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.640
KATE MCKINNON: Yeah.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.015
MILA KUNIS: So I uprooted the
whole family for six months

00:03:22.015 --> 00:03:22.910
for that.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.500
So clearly, I, too, am crazy.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.375
KATE MCKINNON: And I am
so flattered that you

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:29.090
did, sweetie pie, because I
had the best time with you.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.355
Thank you.

00:03:31.355 --> 00:03:32.021
MILA KUNIS: God.

00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:33.452
[SNORTS]

00:03:33.452 --> 00:03:34.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.840
KATE MCKINNON: You know.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.720
MILA KUNIS: No, no, no.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.303
Next question.

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:39.100
KATE MCKINNON: It's like--

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.600
no.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.040
Like, you know, in a romantic
comedy, in the best ones,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:47.060
you love to watch their
sparkling banter and rapport.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.180
It's fun to watch two
people on screen who

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.890
like to talk to each
other, who get each other--

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.230
MILA KUNIS: Who have a rhythm.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.500
KATE MCKINNON: What?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.910
MILA KUNIS: Who have a rhythm?

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:56.990
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:00.940
And so to watch a
friendship that has that,

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.041
and it's genuine, and, I
daresay, in real life as well--

00:04:06.041 --> 00:04:07.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.740
--it's just a joy
to watch people

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.690
who take delight in each other.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.500
And that's what really
drew me to this.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.779
And it felt so real, and like
my relationship with my best

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:21.589
friend and what would happen
if we really got sucked

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.530
into an international espionage
adventure for which we were not

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.510
prepared.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.356
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:28.015
Correct.

00:04:28.015 --> 00:04:29.390
DORINA ARELLANO:
So that's what I

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.690
loved about the movie the most,
is seeing a real friendship,

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.510
especially between two women,
where they raise each other up

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:38.810
and they're not the
stereotypical, like, bad '80s

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.120
movie, where they're
like being mean girls.

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.220
Like, that was
really great to see.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.021
So you guys actually didn't
know each other before the film,

00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:46.520
right?

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.350
But became friends during it.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:54.130
So can you describe each
other in three words?

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.170
MILA KUNIS: Smart.

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.260
Funny.

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:59.877
Inspirational.

00:04:59.877 --> 00:05:00.710
Don't [MUTED] it up.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:01.368
Be nice.

00:05:01.368 --> 00:05:05.352
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:07.316 --> 00:05:08.940
KATE MCKINNON: Can
I use the same ones?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.450
I'm sorry.

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.550
Those are the ones
I would use for you.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.750
DORINA ARELLANO: Aw.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.420
KATE MCKINNON: And may I
add, sparkling, vivacious,

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.300
entrepreneurial spirit.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.350
Yes.

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.430
DORINA ARELLANO: Nice.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:25.638
KATE MCKINNON: Honestly,
your entrepreneurial spirit,

00:05:25.638 --> 00:05:29.025
in addition to your creative
genius, is very inspiring.

00:05:29.025 --> 00:05:29.900
DORINA ARELLANO: Wow.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:30.870
MILA KUNIS: Thank you.

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:32.010
DORINA ARELLANO: Lots
of love going on here.

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:32.760
That's great.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.870
OK.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.180
So, in the movie,
the characters try

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:40.650
to pick out the worst song out
of a jukebox, which I loved,

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:41.560
as a music fan.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.730
So what would you pick?

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.790
I know.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.430
So many.

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.680
MILA KUNIS: As the worst song?

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.110
I like bad songs.

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.110
DORINA ARELLANO: I know.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.490
MILA KUNIS: I like pop music.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.490
I don't know.

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.420
I do.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.600
Guys, I'm not that hip.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.210
Like, it's not like I go see
indie bands in Silver Lake.

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.710
No.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:02.572
DORINA ARELLANO: But there's a
bad song that you like, though.

00:06:02.572 --> 00:06:03.280
Like, what is it?

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.970
MILA KUNIS: I like all of them.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:04.440
They're all bad.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.812
DORINA ARELLANO:
All the bad songs.

00:06:05.812 --> 00:06:06.978
MILA KUNIS: They're all bad.

00:06:06.978 --> 00:06:09.040
None of them stand
the test of time.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.740
It's not like-- you go first,
and I'll think of a bad song.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.990
DORINA ARELLANO: I don't know.

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:14.348
Like Chumbawamba, or something.

00:06:14.348 --> 00:06:15.806
MILA KUNIS: "Who
Let The Dogs Out"?

00:06:15.806 --> 00:06:16.698
KATE MCKINNON: What?

00:06:16.698 --> 00:06:19.020
Chumbawamba is timeless.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.770
MILA KUNIS: Kate--

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.320
DORINA ARELLANO: I know, but
it is not a good song, though.

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.715
KATE MCKINNON: And
prescriptive for living.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.350
You get knocked down,
and you do get up again.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.410
You have to.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.944
What other choice do you have?

00:06:32.944 --> 00:06:34.500
He drinks a whiskey drink.

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.567
He drinks a vodka drink.

00:06:36.567 --> 00:06:37.650
That's Chumbawamba, right?

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.288
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:06:38.288 --> 00:06:39.124
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:06:39.124 --> 00:06:39.624
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:39.624 --> 00:06:40.873
DORINA ARELLANO: You're right.

00:06:40.873 --> 00:06:41.940
It's very philosophical.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.137
Thank you for bringing that up.

00:06:44.137 --> 00:06:45.720
KATE MCKINNON: He
sings the songs that

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.202
remind him of the good times.

00:06:47.202 --> 00:06:49.660
MILA KUNIS: And the songs that
remind him of the bad times.

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:49.910
I know.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:50.040
KATE MCKINNON: No.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.450
Of the best times is the lyric.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:52.170
MILA KUNIS: Oh, best?

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.961
KATE MCKINNON: See?

00:06:52.961 --> 00:06:54.251
It's about positivity.

00:06:54.251 --> 00:06:55.137
MILA KUNIS: OK.

00:06:55.137 --> 00:06:56.095
KATE MCKINNON: [SNORTS]

00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:57.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.147
MILA KUNIS: Can you
think of a bad song?

00:06:59.147 --> 00:07:00.229
KATE MCKINNON: I know one.

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:02.070
I know one song that
I think is a bad song.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.160
MILA KUNIS: What is it?

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.420
KATE MCKINNON: I don't
know the name of it.

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.110
MILA KUNIS: How's it go?

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.940
KATE MCKINNON: I don't want to
knock the artist right here.

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:06.240
DORINA ARELLANO: Do
you know who sings it?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.780
Oh.

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:08.988
That's not the-- they usually
don't write it, anyway,

00:07:08.988 --> 00:07:10.754
so you're fine.

00:07:10.754 --> 00:07:12.560
MILA KUNIS: How's it go?

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:14.140
KATE MCKINNON: OK.

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.137
No.

00:07:16.137 --> 00:07:16.970
DORINA ARELLANO: No?

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:17.450
KATE MCKINNON: No.

00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:17.730
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.330
KATE MCKINNON:
But I've been only

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.413
ever heard one song that
I was like, oh, wow, this

00:07:20.413 --> 00:07:21.345
is a bad song.

00:07:23.797 --> 00:07:25.380
DORINA ARELLANO: I
like to Shazam that

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.767
on the radio in the car.

00:07:26.767 --> 00:07:27.600
KATE MCKINNON: Yeah.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.641
DORINA ARELLANO: Anyways.

00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:32.130
So the great Gillian
Anderson is in this movie.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:35.299
And it appears that Kate and
I have a mutual crush on her.

00:07:35.299 --> 00:07:36.090
MILA KUNIS: Really?

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.040
DORINA ARELLANO:
Because she's awesome.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.680
So, Kate, at one point
you dressed up as Scully

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.510
from "The X-Files,"
which is awesome.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:43.770
KATE MCKINNON: Yes I did.

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:45.900
DORINA ARELLANO: And
you also made a video

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.390
asking Jillian to call you.

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.850
It's viral.

00:07:50.850 --> 00:07:52.767
I'm not making this up.

00:07:52.767 --> 00:07:53.850
KATE MCKINNON: Yes, I did.

00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:55.380
Thanks to the magic
of the internet,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.062
these things never disappear.

00:07:58.062 --> 00:08:00.270
DORINA ARELLANO: Maybe we
can get Google to erase it.

00:08:03.474 --> 00:08:04.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:04.752 --> 00:08:05.710
KATE MCKINNON: Anybody?

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.530
Anybody want to
raise their hand?

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:08.910
Help me out.

00:08:08.910 --> 00:08:10.420
No?

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:10.920
OK.

00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:13.020
DORINA ARELLANO: So
what's the weirdest thing

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.300
a fan has done for you guys?

00:08:18.465 --> 00:08:20.090
MILA KUNIS: There's
lots of worst stuff

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:21.960
of Kate on the internet
than that, guys.

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.336
You can just-- you know.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.960
There's some good
performances that you

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.114
wouldn't let me see that are
online, of you in a play.

00:08:28.114 --> 00:08:29.280
KATE MCKINNON: Right, right.

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.130
You know, again,
anyone in this room

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.059
who would like to choose
to just hack the code

00:08:36.059 --> 00:08:42.675
or whatever, do a little
cleanup, talk to me afterwards.

00:08:42.675 --> 00:08:45.504
I'd be forever grateful.

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:46.920
MILA KUNIS: What
was the question?

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:48.660
KATE MCKINNON: What
was the question?

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:49.200
DORINA ARELLANO:
Apparently you're

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:50.826
here to delete stuff
from the internet.

00:08:50.826 --> 00:08:53.366
MILA KUNIS: I have lots of-- if
somebody's deleting something

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:54.240
for Kate, listen.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.470
I'm on that train.

00:08:56.470 --> 00:08:58.659
I have lots of requests.

00:08:58.659 --> 00:08:59.700
Weird things we've done--

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.685
what was it?

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:02.560
DORINA ARELLANO: So that
was kind of a cool--

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.720
I think it was cool--

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:05.520
weird thing you did
as a fan of Gillian's.

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.390
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, sure, sure.

00:09:06.390 --> 00:09:07.500
DORINA ARELLANO: So what
has been a weird thing

00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.020
a fan has done for you guys?

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.270
MILA KUNIS: Lived in my house.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.730
DORINA ARELLANO: Shut up.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:12.270
MILA KUNIS: Pretty weird.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:13.270
DORINA ARELLANO: No way.

00:09:13.270 --> 00:09:14.469
MILA KUNIS: Yeah, for real.

00:09:14.469 --> 00:09:15.510
That sounds pretty weird.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.260
KATE MCKINNON: What do you mean?

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:20.190
You can't just give
us a little blurb.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:21.890
You've got to tell the story.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.210
MILA KUNIS: Someone
came in uninvited

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:25.590
while I was out of town--

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:26.340
KATE MCKINNON: Wow

00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:31.380
MILA KUNIS: --and decided to
reside in my used-to-be home.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.630
KATE MCKINNON: Because this
person was a fan of yours?

00:09:33.630 --> 00:09:34.420
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:35.170
KATE MCKINNON: OK.

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.770
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:37.061
So I'd say that's pretty weird.

00:09:37.061 --> 00:09:39.070
KATE MCKINNON: It wasn't
just a random squatter.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:40.300
MILA KUNIS: Not
like my cousin, no.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:40.770
It wasn't.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.269
No.

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:42.090
KATE MCKINNON: OK.

00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.810
Yikes.

00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:43.350
DORINA ARELLANO: Wow.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:43.530
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:44.250
It's good, right?

00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:44.630
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:45.338
It's really good.

00:09:45.338 --> 00:09:46.824
It's dark and good.

00:09:46.824 --> 00:09:48.490
MILA KUNIS: But
everything's fine, guys.

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.410
[FAKE LAUGHTER]

00:09:49.410 --> 00:09:49.680
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.179
Good.

00:09:50.179 --> 00:09:54.532
KATE MCKINNON:
[FAKE LAUGHTER] It's fine.

00:09:54.532 --> 00:09:56.415
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:56.415 --> 00:09:57.450
For me, you know--

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.840
gosh.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:09:59.340
No.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.790
People just do nice things.

00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:07.110
I get a lot of self-generated
art about my cat, Nino,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:10.410
because people seem to--
maybe they've heard somewhere

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.117
that I have a very close
relationship with my cat.

00:10:13.117 --> 00:10:15.200
MILA KUNIS: You have a
very unhealthy relationship

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:15.930
with your cat.

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:17.721
KATE MCKINNON: Well,
you call it unhealthy.

00:10:17.721 --> 00:10:19.350
I call it a marriage.

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:20.850
I don't know what
the problem is.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.644
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.830
Anyway, I've gotten a
lot of art about Nino.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.850
And I appreciate it.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:27.140
I love it.

00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.935
MILA KUNIS: Do they paint
your cat, or draw your cat?

00:10:28.935 --> 00:10:29.220
KATE MCKINNON: They paint.

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.150
They knit.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.290
They make t-shirts.

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.670
MILA KUNIS: Do they know
what your cat looks like?

00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:33.690
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, yeah.

00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:34.350
MILA KUNIS: Oh, really?

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:35.391
KATE MCKINNON: Google it.

00:10:35.391 --> 00:10:37.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:38.164 --> 00:10:40.580
I can't believe we're like,
in the headquarters of Google.

00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:40.830
MILA KUNIS: You're not.

00:10:40.830 --> 00:10:41.480
You're not.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.840
That's in San Francisco.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.090
KATE MCKINNON: Oh.

00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:44.339
MILA KUNIS: But this is close.

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:44.960
You're close.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.460
KATE MCKINNON: I
can't believe we're

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:48.192
at like an outpost of Google.

00:10:48.192 --> 00:10:51.629
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.629
MILA KUNIS: Next question.

00:10:59.629 --> 00:11:01.670
DORINA ARELLANO: You guys
are killing me already.

00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:02.450
OK.

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.090
In a good way.

00:11:03.090 --> 00:11:06.680
So both your characters have
hidden skills in the movie--

00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:10.490
everything from trapeze
to video games, shooting.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.780
Are these things you do at
all in your lives, and more

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:18.430
importantly, do you
have any hidden skills?

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:19.930
MILA KUNIS: I have
no hidden skills.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:26.110
KATE MCKINNON: I have--

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:26.890
OK.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.260
I can make fettuccine.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:31.750
Is that a hidden skill?

00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:34.262
I roll my own pasta,
when I have time.

00:11:34.262 --> 00:11:35.470
MILA KUNIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:36.380
That works.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.147
What else?

00:11:37.147 --> 00:11:38.480
KATE MCKINNON: I play the cello.

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:38.770
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh.

00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:39.340
Me, too.

00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:39.790
KATE MCKINNON: Not well.

00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:40.537
You do?

00:11:40.537 --> 00:11:41.004
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:11:41.004 --> 00:11:41.471
KATE MCKINNON: Oh,
let's have a party.

00:11:41.471 --> 00:11:43.721
DORINA ARELLANO: We should
have brought it and jammed.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:47.687
Can your cat come?

00:11:47.687 --> 00:11:48.520
KATE MCKINNON: Sure.

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.020
Oh, no.

00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:50.830
He hates stringed instruments.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.550
Gosh.

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:53.410
When I pick up that
cello or that guitar,

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.190
he runs to the other room.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:57.670
MILA KUNIS: You play the guitar?

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:58.230
KATE MCKINNON: I do.

00:11:58.230 --> 00:11:59.740
MILA KUNIS: So you're
musically inclined would

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:01.690
be a good-- well,
it's not very hidden.

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.590
I feel like people kind of
know you're musically inclined.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.570
Can you do, like, a backbend?

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:07.930
KATE MCKINNON: Whew.

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:08.500
Uh, yeah.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:08.740
Probably.

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:09.880
MILA KUNIS: That's
a good hidden--

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.630
KATE MCKINNON: I'm not going
to do it right now, but.

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:12.600
No, I can't do it.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:13.558
I can't do a back bend.

00:12:13.558 --> 00:12:15.278
Can you?

00:12:15.278 --> 00:12:17.350
MILA KUNIS: No, maybe not.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:19.977
KATE MCKINNON: It's a very
vulnerable position to be in.

00:12:19.977 --> 00:12:21.935
MILA KUNIS: I'm going to
say no just so I'm not

00:12:21.935 --> 00:12:23.830
put on the spot of
doing a back bend.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.327
KATE MCKINNON: Great.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:26.160
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.416
So I got a couple more
questions for you guys then.

00:12:28.416 --> 00:12:29.874
MILA KUNIS: What's
happening, Kate?

00:12:29.874 --> 00:12:31.680
KATE MCKINNON: Nothing.

00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:32.570
I'm just-- I'm ready.

00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:33.150
I'm ready for this.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:33.310
DORINA ARELLANO: You're ready?

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.080
I see you're ready.

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.500
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:35.458
DORINA ARELLANO: I see.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:35.970
OK.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:40.300
So if you weren't acting,
what would you be doing?

00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:42.000
KATE MCKINNON: Carpentry.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.430
10,000% carpentry.

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.550
Specifically, perhaps,
cabinet making.

00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:51.310
But maybe just
general carpentry,

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.110
or refinishing furniture.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:57.640
Also quite interested in
plumbing and electrical.

00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.500
She's on HGTV all day.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:04.570
I love-- I mean, to see the
fruits, the physical fruits,

00:13:04.570 --> 00:13:08.920
the wooden fruits, of one's
labor after the day, I feel,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.780
would be very satisfying.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:14.731
And having refinished a
few pieces of furniture--

00:13:14.731 --> 00:13:16.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:19.430
--I feel like I got
the ball rolling.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.500
So that's my alternate life that
I may turn to at some point.

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:24.040
We'll see.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.540
DORINA ARELLANO:
What have you made?

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:26.914
KATE MCKINNON: I
just refinished,

00:13:26.914 --> 00:13:29.840
you know, some cedar chests.

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.209
And you?

00:13:31.209 --> 00:13:34.702
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.835 --> 00:13:37.631
You speak as though I've not--

00:13:37.631 --> 00:13:39.256
MILA KUNIS: No, I
was like, keep going.

00:13:39.256 --> 00:13:39.970
KATE MCKINNON: Don't make me--

00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:41.261
MILA KUNIS: I am aware of this.

00:13:41.261 --> 00:13:42.060
What?

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:43.500
What would I be
doing if not this?

00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:43.910
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:44.875
MILA KUNIS: Cooking.

00:13:44.875 --> 00:13:45.370
DORINA ARELLANO: Oh.

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:46.120
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, yeah.

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.140
DORINA ARELLANO: So
you're a good cook.

00:13:47.140 --> 00:13:47.934
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:13:47.934 --> 00:13:48.850
DORINA ARELLANO: Nice.

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:49.690
What do you like to make?

00:13:49.690 --> 00:13:50.140
MILA KUNIS: Everything.

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:51.310
I'm a pretty good cook.

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:52.150
DORINA ARELLANO:
You bake everything?

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:52.775
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:13:52.775 --> 00:13:53.690
Horrible baker.

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.750
No.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:55.410
No, no, no.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:56.590
Like, I burn toast.

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:57.530
I don't bake.

00:13:57.530 --> 00:13:58.030
Cook.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.670
Like, I cook really
well all the time.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.380
I mean, I can bake, but just not
desserts, I guess I should say.

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.239
Not like a cookie baker.

00:14:05.239 --> 00:14:07.030
KATE MCKINNON: I have
to say, I'm the same.

00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.084
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:14:07.084 --> 00:14:07.280
You and I both cook a lot.

00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:08.810
KATE MCKINNON: Love
to cook Love to cook.

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:09.190
Cannot bake.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:10.180
MILA KUNIS: I can't
bake a cookie.

00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.420
Like, I literally--
you know that you

00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:12.850
can buy those pre-made
cookies, and they're like,

00:14:12.850 --> 00:14:13.330
this is idiot-proof.

00:14:13.330 --> 00:14:13.570
DORINA ARELLANO: I
can't do it either.

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:14.170
Same.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:15.560
MILA KUNIS: I will burn it.

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:16.060
Yeah.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.160
KATE MCKINNON: You
know why, Mila?

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.105
It's because you don't
play by the rules.

00:14:19.105 --> 00:14:19.938
MILA KUNIS: I don't.

00:14:19.938 --> 00:14:21.615
I also don't like recipes.

00:14:21.615 --> 00:14:21.950
KATE MCKINNON: Me neither.

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:23.574
MILA KUNIS: Like, to
follow directions?

00:14:23.574 --> 00:14:24.410
Ugh.

00:14:24.410 --> 00:14:25.180
Who does that?

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:25.580
KATE MCKINNON: Make it up.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:26.260
Feel it out.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:27.426
MILA KUNIS: It's like ideas.

00:14:27.426 --> 00:14:30.780
Like, go in this idea--
it's like recommendations.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:31.660
Yeah, no.

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:33.370
Done with it.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.890
DORINA ARELLANO: So, if you
were stuck on a desert island--

00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:37.056
it's one of those questions.

00:14:37.056 --> 00:14:38.070
MILA KUNIS: Water.

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:44.800
DORINA ARELLANO: But somehow
could access only one genre

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.270
of movies, what would you pick?

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.290
MILA KUNIS: Romantic comedies.

00:14:47.290 --> 00:14:47.830
KATE MCKINNON: Horror.

00:14:47.830 --> 00:14:48.750
DORINA ARELLANO: Yes.

00:14:48.750 --> 00:14:51.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.330
MILA KUNIS: I hate horror.

00:14:54.330 --> 00:14:54.927
I hate it.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:57.010
DORINA ARELLANO: You don't
watch any scary movies?

00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:57.635
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:14:57.635 --> 00:14:59.140
Like, I genuinely get scared.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.100
And then I can't sleep.

00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:02.260
And then my husband's like, this
is the biggest mistake ever.

00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:03.385
Why did I let you watch it?

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:05.109
I'm like a 12-year-old.

00:15:05.109 --> 00:15:07.150
DORINA ARELLANO: What's
the last one you watched?

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.547
MILA KUNIS: I haven't.

00:15:08.547 --> 00:15:09.130
"The Shining"?

00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:09.990
I don't know.

00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:10.865
DORINA ARELLANO: Wow.

00:15:10.865 --> 00:15:11.390
OK.

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.848
MILA KUNIS: I really
do get scared.

00:15:12.848 --> 00:15:14.540
Like, I get very emotional.

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:15.340
And then I worry.

00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:17.200
If there's a child in
it, I'm like, well,

00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.033
where is its mother?

00:15:18.033 --> 00:15:20.535
Like, I get very
uncomfortable, very quickly.

00:15:20.535 --> 00:15:22.660
DORINA ARELLANO: The child
usually eats its mother,

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:23.080
so there you go.

00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.070
MILA KUNIS: If there's a child
in the preview, I promise you,

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:25.710
I'm not seeing that movie.

00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.720
Like, I am not kidding you.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.610
If they have like a child, and
the door opens, and it's like,

00:15:28.610 --> 00:15:29.110
mrahh--

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.142
I'm like, no.

00:15:30.142 --> 00:15:31.824
Not having it.

00:15:31.824 --> 00:15:32.740
You love that [MUTED].

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.365
KATE MCKINNON: I find
it very relaxing.

00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:40.220
DORINA ARELLANO: What's
your favorite scary movie?

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:40.940
KATE MCKINNON: Horror movie?

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:41.600
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.016
KATE MCKINNON: The
one that really

00:15:43.016 --> 00:15:45.950
laid me out on my parents'
floor for a week and a half

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.515
was the original "Omen"
with Gregory Peck.

00:15:48.515 --> 00:15:49.640
DORINA ARELLANO: Very good.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.515
KATE MCKINNON: When he
goes into that grave--

00:15:51.515 --> 00:15:53.730
spoiler alert-- and
finds the dead jackal--

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.122
ooh, wow.

00:15:56.122 --> 00:15:57.830
MILA KUNIS: That's
what you want to watch

00:15:57.830 --> 00:16:01.460
by yourself on a desert island?

00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:03.907
Well, you and I should
not be deserted together.

00:16:03.907 --> 00:16:06.490
KATE MCKINNON: But did you hear
her original answer was water?

00:16:06.490 --> 00:16:08.846
And that's because she has
an entrepreneurial spirit.

00:16:08.846 --> 00:16:10.491
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:10.491 --> 00:16:11.990
She knows what she
needs to survive.

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:13.490
And she also knows
that she can sell it

00:16:13.490 --> 00:16:14.906
to the other people
on the island.

00:16:18.617 --> 00:16:20.825
MILA KUNIS: I would just
barter it for better movies.

00:16:28.190 --> 00:16:30.980
DORINA ARELLANO: So who
or what inspired you

00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.895
to get into acting and comedy?

00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:34.520
MILA KUNIS: Oh.

00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:35.061
I don't know.

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:35.810
I was nine.

00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:37.430
Kate-- I don't know.

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:39.170
Maybe Lucille Ball, actually.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:39.845
You know what?

00:16:39.845 --> 00:16:40.520
Maybe Lucille Ball.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.228
Because the first
thing I saw when I came

00:16:42.228 --> 00:16:44.499
to the States was Nick at Nite.

00:16:44.499 --> 00:16:46.040
And I started watching
a lot of that.

00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.650
So it was a lot of "I Love
Lucy," "Three's Company."

00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:50.650
I'm trying to remember--
like, Mary Tyler Moore.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:54.080
Like, a lot of old, like, 60s,
70s shows, and predating that.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.060
And so I think I
would definitely

00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:58.379
say I'm probably
inspired by Lucille Ball.

00:16:58.379 --> 00:16:59.170
KATE MCKINNON: Wow.

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.060
Cool.

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:08.140
For me it was just "Saturday
Night Live--" really just that.

00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.209
And Mel Brooks movies.

00:17:09.209 --> 00:17:10.750
MILA KUNIS: I love
Mel Brooks movies.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:11.859
KATE MCKINNON: I mean, in my
house it was all Mel Brooks,

00:17:11.859 --> 00:17:12.460
all the time.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:14.589
You had no choice.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:18.030
DORINA ARELLANO: Favorite Mel
Brooks movies for both of you.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:19.319
KATE MCKINNON: "Producers."

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:20.369
"Young Frankenstein."

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:21.744
MILA KUNIS: "Young
Frankenstein."

00:17:21.744 --> 00:17:22.952
DORINA ARELLANO: Good choice.

00:17:22.952 --> 00:17:24.918
KATE MCKINNON: Is
there a choice?

00:17:24.918 --> 00:17:26.385
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:27.564 --> 00:17:28.075
Yeah.

00:17:28.075 --> 00:17:29.200
DORINA ARELLANO: Which one?

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.420
MILA KUNIS: "Producers"
was the best one.

00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:32.253
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:17:32.253 --> 00:17:33.670
So, last question.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.190
I think we have time
for one question.

00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:39.700
And then we'll open up the
floor to audience questions.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.940
And I'll throw this and be
super awkward about this.

00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.940
MILA KUNIS: What's that?

00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:44.440
DORINA ARELLANO:
It's our microphone

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.820
that we throw to the audience.

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:46.840
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, that's neat.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:47.440
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:47.800
Unless it hits
someone in the head.

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:50.320
KATE MCKINNON: Only
at Google would they

00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:52.240
come up with a
throwable microphone.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.883
So cool.

00:17:53.883 --> 00:17:56.086
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.890
DORINA ARELLANO: So what
would be your dream role

00:18:02.890 --> 00:18:03.490
as an actress?

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:09.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:14.259 --> 00:18:15.300
MILA KUNIS: I don't know.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.966
KATE MCKINNON: Truly,
there are so many.

00:18:16.966 --> 00:18:20.810
There are so many
badass women of history

00:18:20.810 --> 00:18:27.290
that I would love to inhabit
persona-wise and also wig-wise.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.050
I will say that my dream
role in musical theater

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:37.718
is Ms. Hannigan, for any of
you who prize musical theater.

00:18:37.718 --> 00:18:39.426
MILA KUNIS: They've
got two of them here.

00:18:39.426 --> 00:18:39.924
KATE MCKINNON: Yeah.

00:18:39.924 --> 00:18:40.424
I know.

00:18:40.424 --> 00:18:41.418
It's Google.

00:18:44.406 --> 00:18:45.402
MILA KUNIS: But, yes.

00:18:45.402 --> 00:18:45.960
I agree with you.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.501
I don't know.

00:18:46.501 --> 00:18:48.680
I have nothing.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.510
I can make something
up, but I don't--

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:50.690
you know.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:51.290
I don't know.

00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:51.900
DORINA ARELLANO: What's
the first thing that

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:52.816
popped into your head?

00:18:52.816 --> 00:18:54.570
Like a rock star or someone?

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:55.387
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:18:55.387 --> 00:18:56.220
DORINA ARELLANO: No?

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:57.090
MILA KUNIS: A rock star?

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.080
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.000
You wouldn't want
to play a rock star?

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:01.140
MILA KUNIS: Like who?

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:01.800
DORINA ARELLANO: Anyone.

00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:02.500
MILA KUNIS: Like Gwen Stefani?

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.930
DORINA ARELLANO: Everyone from--

00:19:03.930 --> 00:19:05.130
MILA KUNIS: Like,
what are you thinking?

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:07.130
DORINA ARELLANO: That's the
first rock star you thought of?

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.088
MILA KUNIS: Who do you
think that I would play?

00:19:09.088 --> 00:19:11.710
Look at me.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:12.990
What rock star--

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:14.010
DORINA ARELLANO: Anyone.

00:19:14.010 --> 00:19:16.734
Anyone from Janis Joplin to--

00:19:16.734 --> 00:19:17.775
MILA KUNIS: Janis Joplin?

00:19:17.775 --> 00:19:18.090
DORINA ARELLANO: Yeah.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:19.105
You could do it.

00:19:19.105 --> 00:19:20.480
Don't you guys
think Mila could--

00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.915
MILA KUNIS: I have
no musical skills.

00:19:21.915 --> 00:19:22.415
No.

00:19:22.415 --> 00:19:23.430
I should be fired.

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:25.260
DORINA ARELLANO: You
don't have to sing.

00:19:25.260 --> 00:19:25.980
MILA KUNIS: Yes, you do.

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:27.354
If you're portraying
a rock star,

00:19:27.354 --> 00:19:29.712
you should have,
like, at least rhythm.

00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:31.420
DORINA ARELLANO: Can
you not sing at all?

00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:33.419
MILA KUNIS: Well, I mean,
I like to think I can.

00:19:33.419 --> 00:19:34.425
I've been told I can.

00:19:34.425 --> 00:19:34.810
DORINA ARELLANO:
Can she sing, Kate?

00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:35.110
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:36.234
Kate don't answer that one.

00:19:36.234 --> 00:19:37.290
I'll answer it for us.

00:19:37.290 --> 00:19:39.560
No.

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.550
I know you love me.

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.092
No.

00:19:43.092 --> 00:19:44.050
KATE MCKINNON: You can.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:44.170
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:44.290
I know.

00:19:44.290 --> 00:19:44.700
You're sweet.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.380
KATE MCKINNON: I was
just agreeing with you.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:47.760
MILA KUNIS: You're a
very supportive friend.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:48.600
You're very nice.

00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.180
KATE MCKINNON: Why don't you
sing something now and let

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:51.180
us be the judge of that?

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:51.920
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.220
Guys.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:54.510
Here's the thing.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:55.800
Don't worry, guys.

00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:57.480
I do a cartoon
called "Family Guy."

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.230
And for 15 years--

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.140
KATE MCKINNON: What?

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:00.430
MILA KUNIS: --I
have-- again, Google.

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.000
Wrong audience.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:01.520
Wrong audience.

00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.270
They're too nerdy.

00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:04.270
They're like, what's that?

00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:06.760
We don't solve algorithms
or [MUTED] like that.

00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.520
But for 15 years,
I've been like,

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.900
I'm not singing on your show.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.380
MacFarlane made me sing,
15 years ago, three lines,

00:20:14.380 --> 00:20:15.640
and it took three hours.

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.030
And I was like, I'm not
doing this ever again.

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:21.120
Three months ago, they put
me in a recording booth

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.290
and I had to sing a whole
thing of "Oklahoma."

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:26.680
So in a year, you will hear
Meg-- and this is, by the way--

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.800
if ever you see this, should
you ever want to, remember,

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.150
that's me trying.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:34.254
That's me trying to be good.

00:20:34.254 --> 00:20:35.420
That's all you need to know.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.310
I don't need to showcase it.

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:37.240
Everybody will see it.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.350
It's in "Family Guy."

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:42.310
It's coming soon, me singing
"Oklahoma," the best I can.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:43.150
Keep in mind.

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:43.630
DORINA ARELLANO: Well.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:44.560
Look out for that, guys.

00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.601
MILA KUNIS: I mean, guys.

00:20:45.601 --> 00:20:46.330
It's brilliant.

00:20:48.437 --> 00:20:49.270
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.130
So, who wants to ask
the first question?

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:53.890
MILA KUNIS: Nobody.

00:20:53.890 --> 00:20:56.320
DORINA ARELLANO: I'm going
to throw this at you so I

00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.197
don't hit anyone in the head.

00:20:59.197 --> 00:21:00.280
AUDIENCE: Can you hear me?

00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:00.990
OK, sweet.

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.390
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:01.890
Hello.

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:03.490
AUDIENCE: I have a
question for Mila.

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.590
I've heard Topher and
Ashton and a few people talk

00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:08.320
about how great "That '70s
Show" was, making that.

00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.960
Would you make a movie
follow-up to that,

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:12.652
or get back into it in any way?

00:21:12.652 --> 00:21:13.360
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:15.940
I mean, yeah, it was great.

00:21:15.940 --> 00:21:18.305
I feel like I'm too old
to reprise a 16-year-old.

00:21:18.305 --> 00:21:19.430
AUDIENCE: But then and now.

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:20.840
MILA KUNIS: But would we--

00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:21.340
yeah.

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:22.030
Of course.

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:22.552
We love it.

00:21:22.552 --> 00:21:24.010
Plus, I met my
husband on the show.

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:26.365
So yeah, I think
the show is great.

00:21:26.365 --> 00:21:27.845
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:27.845 --> 00:21:28.345
Yeah.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.240
AUDIENCE: Another
question for Mila.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.431
Do you still play games?

00:21:34.431 --> 00:21:35.430
Do you find time for it?

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:36.055
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:21:36.055 --> 00:21:36.555
I have kids.

00:21:36.555 --> 00:21:37.221
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:21:37.221 --> 00:21:38.090
MILA KUNIS: I know.

00:21:38.090 --> 00:21:40.400
I spent-- what is it?

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.860
I'd say 20 to 24, 25.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.570
It took up a lot of my life.

00:21:45.570 --> 00:21:48.697
And I would shoot movies,
and you go on breaks.

00:21:48.697 --> 00:21:51.030
So you get, like, a five
minute break in between scenes.

00:21:51.030 --> 00:21:52.770
And I was like, I gotta go!

00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.770
And I'd be on some raid,
and they're like, well,

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:55.530
you need to go back to set.

00:21:55.530 --> 00:21:56.890
And I was like, shut up!

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:58.550
Like, I think it literally--

00:21:58.550 --> 00:21:59.770
it was just too much.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:01.089
It was unhealthy.

00:22:01.089 --> 00:22:02.380
It was just not healthy for me.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:04.320
KATE MCKINNON: I
have a question.

00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.588
Raid?

00:22:05.588 --> 00:22:07.812
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:07.812 --> 00:22:08.520
MILA KUNIS: Yeah.

00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:10.200
KATE MCKINNON: What game?

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:10.959
What are raids?

00:22:10.959 --> 00:22:12.000
MILA KUNIS: You do raids.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.550
You know what I'm
talking about, Ray Ray.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:16.440
Like, if you do
first person shooter

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:19.150
games or any of those games,
you can kind of pop in and out.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:20.670
But if you're
doing a group game,

00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:22.920
if you're not going through
the story mode-- ha.

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.120
You see what you started?

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:27.840
Then you are responsible
for your group.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:31.950
And I, a lot of times, was
either like a healer, or--

00:22:31.950 --> 00:22:33.200
long story short.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:33.960
OK.

00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:34.700
What's the next question?

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:35.699
KATE MCKINNON: A healer?

00:22:35.699 --> 00:22:37.361
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:39.480
You do have secret skills.

00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.150
Whoa.

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:41.430
AUDIENCE: That's one
way to catch a mic.

00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:42.263
KATE MCKINNON: Whoa.

00:22:42.263 --> 00:22:44.820
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
about your hidden talents

00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:45.590
that you were talking about.

00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:47.714
You were saying that you
might take up woodworking.

00:22:47.714 --> 00:22:50.460
Have you ever happened
to talk to Ron

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:52.580
Swanson about canoemaking?

00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:53.791
Has that ever been--

00:22:53.791 --> 00:22:54.582
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:22:54.582 --> 00:22:56.040
Yes.

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.720
I did an episode of something,
and Nick Offerman was there.

00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.220
And yeah.

00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.470
We talked about furniture
making the whole time.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:05.220
What an incredible life he has.

00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:09.140
Married to the eminent
Megan Mullally.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.670
Sitcom star.

00:23:10.670 --> 00:23:12.240
Comedian extraordinaire.

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:15.500
And he makes gorgeous
pieces with live wood edges.

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.390
Come on.

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:19.250
MILA KUNIS: He does
like the big tables--

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:20.540
KATE MCKINNON: Huge.

00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:22.070
Oh.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.000
Beautiful pieces.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.140
Yes.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.470
He knows what's up.

00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:28.500
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:29.970
I have two questions.

00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:32.290
Simple and difficult ones.

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.140
So the difficult one--

00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:36.210
do you use any Google products?

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:37.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:40.590
And the simple one is,
since you mentioned

00:23:40.590 --> 00:23:43.300
you have some
entrepreneurial spirit,

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.390
can you suggest any
Google products?

00:23:45.390 --> 00:23:46.374
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:46.374 --> 00:23:51.000
New products that Google
should develop or something?

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.130
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:23:53.130 --> 00:23:54.760
I can answer this.

00:23:54.760 --> 00:24:02.220
I do have some friends
working on a Kitty Hawk--

00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.390
the flying car from Google.

00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:06.686
So I can recommend that.

00:24:06.686 --> 00:24:07.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:10.660
If you'd like to buy it,
you can contact Dave Clark.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:12.290
He's selling them.

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:14.630
Sebastian is the one who's
working on the product.

00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:15.830
It's a fantastic product.

00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:19.290
I may go out to Vegas to fly it.

00:24:19.290 --> 00:24:22.489
But you asked, and
I shall answer.

00:24:22.489 --> 00:24:24.030
KATE MCKINNON: I
just thought of one.

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.280
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.684
MILA KUNIS: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:30.684 --> 00:24:32.100
KATE MCKINNON: She
speaks Russian.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.060
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:36.370
KATE MCKINNON: I have an idea.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:38.453
I was just looking at these
plants and I was like,

00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:39.930
what about Google Irrigation?

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:41.570
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:41.570 --> 00:24:45.130
It waters your plants for you.

00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.376
It's a self-watering,
self-timing waterer.

00:24:49.376 --> 00:24:51.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:53.710
I'll take 10%.

00:24:53.710 --> 00:24:54.497
Thank you.

00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:56.445
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:03.270
DORINA ARELLANO: Any others?

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:03.894
Oh.

00:25:03.894 --> 00:25:04.810
I'll go in the middle.

00:25:09.054 --> 00:25:10.720
AUDIENCE: Similar to
the question about,

00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.250
what would be your
dream role, do

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.640
you have a dream actor that
you want to work with that you

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.690
haven't worked with yet?

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:18.780
And this is for both of you.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:21.390
MILA KUNIS: I love Matt Damon.

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.335
So yeah.

00:25:23.335 --> 00:25:24.891
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:24.891 --> 00:25:25.390
It's OK.

00:25:25.390 --> 00:25:27.800
My husband knows.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.820
I love Matt Damon, guys.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:31.940
I do.

00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:36.710
KATE MCKINNON: You know, one
of my comedy heroes of all time

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:37.799
is Catherine O'Hara.

00:25:37.799 --> 00:25:38.840
And I have never met her.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:40.070
So yeah.

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:41.925
MILA KUNIS: I drove
next to her once.

00:25:41.925 --> 00:25:42.960
KATE MCKINNON: Shut up.

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.367
What did she say?

00:25:44.367 --> 00:25:45.200
MILA KUNIS: Nothing.

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.300
But I got really excited.

00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:49.220
And it was on Melrose
and La Cienega.

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.880
And I was making a left-hand
turn, and she was in an SUV

00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:53.450
next to me.

00:25:53.450 --> 00:25:55.231
And literally, I think
I went like this--

00:25:55.231 --> 00:25:58.440
[GASPS] and I think she was
like, who the [MUTED] is

00:25:58.440 --> 00:25:59.690
that crazy girl looking at me?

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:01.870
And I think I just didn't
do anything other than look

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:02.369
at her.

00:26:02.369 --> 00:26:03.824
I love her.

00:26:03.824 --> 00:26:04.490
That's my story.

00:26:04.490 --> 00:26:04.930
That's all I got.

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:06.350
That's a minute of your
life you'll never get back.

00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:08.641
KATE MCKINNON: I thought you
guys were in the same car.

00:26:08.641 --> 00:26:09.320
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.836
No.

00:26:10.836 --> 00:26:12.973
On the same street.

00:26:12.973 --> 00:26:13.607
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:13.607 --> 00:26:16.190
DORINA ARELLANO: I saw her at a
Yogurt Land and I freaked out.

00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:17.440
MILA KUNIS: Which Yogurt Land?

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.820
DORINA ARELLANO: The one
on Sawtelle and Olympic.

00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.340
So maybe she hangs out there.

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.660
KATE MCKINNON: What
flavor was she having?

00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.041
What were her
toppings of choice?

00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:28.029
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:28.029 --> 00:26:29.520
DORINA ARELLANO: I don't know.

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:30.311
MILA KUNIS: I know.

00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:31.505
I agree with you on that.

00:26:31.505 --> 00:26:32.005
OK.

00:26:34.864 --> 00:26:35.530
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.029
OK.

00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:38.337
So during filming, did
you have any funny moments

00:26:38.337 --> 00:26:39.670
that you had between each other?

00:26:39.670 --> 00:26:41.200
You spent a lot of time on set.

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:43.275
Any pranks or anything
fun you all did?

00:26:43.275 --> 00:26:43.900
MILA KUNIS: Um.

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:44.710
Pranks.

00:26:44.710 --> 00:26:47.392
No, because we're adults.

00:26:47.392 --> 00:26:48.334
KATE MCKINNON: Ho, ho!

00:26:48.334 --> 00:26:51.160
Hey!

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.102
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:26:52.102 --> 00:26:54.250
Because in between
takes I was nursing.

00:26:54.250 --> 00:26:57.910
So I would honestly-- to answer
seriously, I was with my baby.

00:26:57.910 --> 00:26:59.920
KATE MCKINNON: Pump up the jam.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:01.222
Pump it.

00:27:01.222 --> 00:27:03.589
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:03.589 --> 00:27:05.880
MILA KUNIS: And then Kate
would just chit chat with me.

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.505
And then I would go
into my little hole

00:27:07.505 --> 00:27:08.680
and pump and feed the baby.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.096
Like, it was so
not that exciting.

00:27:12.590 --> 00:27:15.730
I saw lots of bathrooms
everywhere we were.

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:19.730
Everywhere I pumped was a
bathroom and a little sheet.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:20.620
You know.

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:21.850
What did you do?

00:27:21.850 --> 00:27:25.300
KATE MCKINNON: Banana
peels, all day, everyday.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:25.800
Yeah.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.010
I killed a few people.

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:28.510
No.

00:27:28.510 --> 00:27:28.900
I'm kidding.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:29.400
No.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.865
I don't like practical jokes.

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:31.990
MILA KUNIS: I don't either.

00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:33.030
KATE MCKINNON: Or pranks.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:33.310
MILA KUNIS: Oh, yes, I do.

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:33.976
That's not true.

00:27:33.976 --> 00:27:36.130
KATE MCKINNON: Oh,
you like pranks?

00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:37.644
MILA KUNIS: Not done to me.

00:27:37.644 --> 00:27:38.560
KATE MCKINNON: Uh-huh.

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:39.520
Right, right.

00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:41.812
MILA KUNIS: No, I like
it done to other people.

00:27:41.812 --> 00:27:43.520
KATE MCKINNON: I'm a
hypochon-- a hoppo--

00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:46.260
[LAUGHS] I'm a
"hoppochondriac," so I

00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:49.360
don't feel that I would ever
do a prank, just in case

00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.944
something horrible went wrong.

00:27:50.944 --> 00:27:53.110
Like, if you drop bucket
of water on someone's head,

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:54.820
what's to say that
they're not looking up

00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.406
and they drown in the water?

00:27:57.406 --> 00:27:59.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:59.390 --> 00:28:01.100
Then you've got a
lawsuit on your hands.

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.852
Pump up the jam.

00:28:02.852 --> 00:28:04.207
Pump it up.

00:28:04.207 --> 00:28:05.040
DORINA ARELLANO: OK.

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:05.410
We've got--

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:07.618
MILA KUNIS: That doesn't
answer your question at all.

00:28:07.618 --> 00:28:08.540
I'm so sorry.

00:28:08.540 --> 00:28:09.986
I'm so sorry.

00:28:09.986 --> 00:28:11.860
DORINA ARELLANO: So we
got one more question.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.540
MILA KUNIS: It better
be really good.

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:14.850
Make it a good one.

00:28:14.850 --> 00:28:16.540
KATE MCKINNON: Shit.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.769
AUDIENCE: Too much pressure.

00:28:17.769 --> 00:28:19.060
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, my goodness.

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.660
What's it going to be?

00:28:22.660 --> 00:28:23.300
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:28.120
Since social media, it's
going on super fast nowadays,

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:30.700
and everything is there--

00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:32.410
since you're a
celebrity, and you

00:28:32.410 --> 00:28:35.710
said somebody was in your
house, how do you manage that?

00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:37.869
Like, in your personal life?

00:28:37.869 --> 00:28:38.410
I don't know.

00:28:38.410 --> 00:28:39.493
Like, we share everything.

00:28:39.493 --> 00:28:42.620
Like, oh, we're here with Mila,
and we're having a great time.

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:44.129
And then a lot of people can't--

00:28:44.129 --> 00:28:44.670
I don't know.

00:28:44.670 --> 00:28:46.247
How do you manage both?

00:28:46.247 --> 00:28:47.205
MILA KUNIS: No problem.

00:28:47.205 --> 00:28:49.930
I don't have social media.

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.550
Neither does Kate.

00:28:51.550 --> 00:28:52.600
AUDIENCE: Oh, cool.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.460
MILA KUNIS: So that is how
we manage social media--

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.430
by not having it, Google.

00:29:00.430 --> 00:29:03.370
So that's that.

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:06.160
But to your point,
the biggest problem

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:07.754
that I have with people--

00:29:07.754 --> 00:29:08.920
that's a horrible statement.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.211
That's not what I meant to say.

00:29:10.211 --> 00:29:12.610
Like, as far as people taking
photos and posting them,

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:14.170
is when I'm with
my kids, I do ask

00:29:14.170 --> 00:29:16.831
them to post it after I leave,
only for security reasons.

00:29:16.831 --> 00:29:18.580
I'm like, just don't
post that you're here

00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:20.246
with me if my child's
in the background.

00:29:20.246 --> 00:29:21.430
I just don't want that.

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:22.857
Post it an hour later--

00:29:22.857 --> 00:29:23.440
to your point.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.270
But I don't have-- we
don't have social media.

00:29:25.270 --> 00:29:26.490
But we've heard
of this "Google,"

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.460
and we hear it's great.

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:28.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.640
And you guys have
a Google phone.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.800
We hear that's lovely.

00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.420
And other great Google things.

00:29:35.420 --> 00:29:37.060
Yay, Eric Schmidt, right?

00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.140
Larry Page, guys?

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:38.720
I know words.

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:39.511
KATE MCKINNON: Yes.

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:40.735
Yes.

00:29:40.735 --> 00:29:45.020
I use the search
engine all the time.

00:29:45.020 --> 00:29:46.300
MILA KUNIS: Sergei.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.160
Google.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.222
Things.

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:48.930
It's like a verb.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.388
KATE MCKINNON: I'm
always Googling.

00:29:50.388 --> 00:29:51.952
I'm Googling all day.

00:29:51.952 --> 00:29:53.410
MILA KUNIS: This
nice little girl--

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:55.618
the girl, to describe-- the
woman standing back there

00:29:55.618 --> 00:29:56.496
had a question.

00:29:56.496 --> 00:29:56.996
Is that it?

00:29:56.996 --> 00:29:57.490
Yes?

00:29:57.490 --> 00:29:59.073
AUDIENCE: Favorite
musical guest who's

00:29:59.073 --> 00:30:01.060
been on "SNL" since
you've been on the cast?

00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.143
MILA KUNIS: Good question.

00:30:02.143 --> 00:30:03.541
KATE MCKINNON: Oh, my goodness.

00:30:03.541 --> 00:30:04.040
Wow.

00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:04.810
MILA KUNIS: I've asked you this.

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:05.800
KATE MCKINNON: You know what?

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:06.580
You know what?

00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:08.560
There was this week when--

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.570
I don't know if
you've heard of Adele.

00:30:10.570 --> 00:30:11.800
She came.

00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:12.250
AUDIENCE: I've
never heard of her.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.124
KATE MCKINNON: It was
that week that she also

00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:19.060
filmed her live concert
at Radio City Music Hall.

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:20.470
And we all got to go.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.570
And that was-- it's the
biggest venue in the world.

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:27.580
Maybe that's not correct.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:29.830
But it sure looks like the
biggest venue in the world.

00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:31.480
MILA KUNIS: Do you know that I
performed at Radio City Music

00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:31.750
Hall?

00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:32.530
KATE MCKINNON: What did you do?

00:30:32.530 --> 00:30:34.780
MILA KUNIS: Finish your
story, and then I'll tell you.

00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:36.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.350
KATE MCKINNON: Anyway, she sang.

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:42.940
Her glorious voice filled
the hallowed halls,

00:30:42.940 --> 00:30:44.470
and it was transcendent.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.304
What was your story?

00:30:45.304 --> 00:30:47.761
MILA KUNIS: Well, because you
were talking about Radio City

00:30:47.761 --> 00:30:48.544
Music Hall.

00:30:48.544 --> 00:30:49.960
And at one point,
"Family Guy," we

00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:51.310
did live readings all around.

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.060
[ONE PERSON CLAPS]

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:52.821
That's right.

00:30:52.821 --> 00:30:53.320
One person.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:53.820
Yes.

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:55.074
KATE MCKINNON: Fun.

00:30:55.074 --> 00:30:57.490
MILA KUNIS: And so we performed
all at different theaters.

00:30:57.490 --> 00:30:59.710
And we sold out Radio City
Music Hall a couple of nights.

00:30:59.710 --> 00:31:01.251
And I was like, you
know what, if I'm

00:31:01.251 --> 00:31:03.130
going to stand on the
stage and perform,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.420
I want to put on some
tap shoes, and then

00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.220
say, I can perform at
Radio City Music Hall.

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.530
So I put on tap shoes, and
tapped my way down the stage

00:31:08.530 --> 00:31:09.580
once, and went, look.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.440
I performed at Radio
City Music Hall.

00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:14.890
And that was my big story
that I can tell people now.

00:31:14.890 --> 00:31:16.240
KATE MCKINNON: Do you still tap?

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.142
MILA KUNIS: No.

00:31:17.142 --> 00:31:18.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:20.310 --> 00:31:22.690
But I wanted to say that I
performed at Radio City Music

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:22.960
Hall.

00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:23.580
DORINA ARELLANO:
So you can totally

00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:24.190
be a rock star in a movie.

00:31:24.190 --> 00:31:25.360
KATE MCKINNON: That's
entrepreneurial spirit.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.410
MILA KUNIS: But not well.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:30.820
Just a failed rock star,
who can't sing or tap.

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.080
KATE MCKINNON: [LAUGHING]

00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:33.430
DORINA ARELLANO: But performed
at Radio City Music Hall.

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:33.770
MILA KUNIS: Yes.

00:31:33.770 --> 00:31:35.530
DORINA ARELLANO: So that's all
the time we have, you guys.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:37.240
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.156
MILA KUNIS: Thank you.

00:31:38.156 --> 00:31:39.530
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:39.530 --> 00:31:41.370
DORINA ARELLANO:
Everyone, please go

00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:44.200
watch "The Spy Who
Dumped Me" on August 3.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.590
It's really funny.

00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:48.500
Thank you everyone
for being here.
