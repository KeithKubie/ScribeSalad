00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
Sal: We now know all
about strong acids.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.700
For example, hydrochloric acid
in an aqueous solution.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.500
It's strong because it
disassociate completely into

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.920
hydrogen ions or hydronium
molecules, depending on how

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.590
you want to view it.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.890
And chloride anions.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.410
And it's an acid in the
Arrhenius definition, because

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.326
once again, this is an
aqueous solution.

00:00:28.326 --> 00:00:32.159
In the Arrhenius definition
because it is increasing the

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.590
hydrogen concentration
in the water.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.490
It's an acid in the
Bronsted-Lowry definition

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.950
because this thing is donating
these hydrogen protons.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.810
And it's a Lewis acid because
you can kind of view it as

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.480
hydrochloric acid.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.180
By giving away this, it's taking
these-- the chloride,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.970
as you can kind of say,
it's taking the

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.190
electrons for itself.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.740
So it's an electron acceptor.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.100
So that's another reason
why it's a Lewis acid.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.190
But in every case, it completely
disassociates.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.150
So it's a strong acid.

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.980
Now, by implication, when I call
this a strong acid, that

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.600
must mean that there must be
things called weak acids.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.170
And you could probably
guess what they do.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.850
They don't disassociate
completely.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:27.620
So let's say you have
hydrofluoric acid in an

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.380
aqueous solution.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.370
It does disassociate somewhat,
so you are going to have some

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.320
hydrogen break-off of the
fluorine molecules.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360
So a hydrogen ion, and
that's of course

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.740
in an aqueous solution.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.830
I was doing aqueous in blue.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.315
And then that's going to
disassociate with the

00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:56.170
fluoride, the fluorine cation.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.780
But this is a weak
acid, so it's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.490
not just in one direction.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.210
It actually goes in both.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.070
This is an equilibrium
reaction.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.280
We know all about these now.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.670
Which means that some of this
goes in that direction, some

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.740
of that goes in that direction,
and both of these

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.720
species exist in the molecule.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.010
And just as aside, you might
wonder hey, aren't fluorine

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.690
and chlorine-- they're
both halogens.

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.940
Why is this a weak acid while
this is a strong one?

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.940
And this is just an aside.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.220
This is something I always
used to wonder about.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.160
So in general, hydrogen
likes to form bonds.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.390
Remember, alkali metals
we included

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.850
everything below hydrogen.

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:37.180
Right?

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.540
We included all of these guys.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.470
All of these guys, they have
this 1 extra electron and

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.470
they're on a valence shell, so
they just want to give it up.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.310
And they tend to be very
willing to give

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.320
it up to these guys.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.500
So if you have any of these
period 2 and below with a

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.600
halogen, you normally form
this ionic salt.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.730
Where this guy gives away an
electron, and one of these

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.110
guys takes it, and you have
an ionic compound.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.540
Hydrogen's a little different.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.630
Hydrogen does have exactly
1 electron in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.270
it's outermost shell.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.780
It just has one shell.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.820
But the first shell is
interesting because it's

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.110
complete when it only
has 2 electrons.

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:16.340
These guys wouldn't
have been happy.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.490
If you gave 1 electron
to these guys-- they

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:19.060
need to get to eight.

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.800
So they're not happy.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.790
But if you give 1 electron
to hydrogen,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.590
hydrogen is pretty happy.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.580
So when hydrogen forms bonds
with these guys here, it

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.140
doesn't just completely
give up the electron.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.630
When hydrogen forms bonds with
our halogens over here, it

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:37.620
doesn't completely give
up the electron.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.250
Because hydrogen says hey, if
you give me some of the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.450
electron, then I get to 2.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.540
And then if you share the
electron, you get to 8.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.510
So it does definitely like the
bond with these guys, but

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.250
doesn't give it completely up.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.280
Now.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.440
Hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic
acid, and hydroiodic-- I think

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.100
I think I'm seeing it right--
these are all strong acids.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.620
When hydrogen bonds with
any of these guys.

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.690
Which means it disassociates
completely in water.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.310
But when hydrogen bonds with
flourine, it doesn't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.440
disassociate completely
in water.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.670
And the reason why is flourine
is even more electronegative.

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.770
So this bond between hydrogen
and fluorine-- so if you

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:22.790
compare hydrogen fluorine or
hydrofluoric acid to hydrogen

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.410
chloride, hydrogen fluoride to
hydrogen chloride, this bond

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.660
is much stronger.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:30.440
Not much stronger.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.620
I mean, you can measure in the
energy of the bond, and we'll

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.270
do that eventually.

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.970
But this is a stronger bond
than this right here.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.650
And hydrobromic is
even weaker.

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:40.280
Let me draw it.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.660
So this one is a little bit
weaker than that one and then

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.980
hydrobromic-- I'll draw it
as one line right there.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:47.350
It's like that.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.850
So these are easier to break, so
when you put this in water,

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.700
hydrogen sees these water
molecules that have these

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.280
extra electron pairs
floating around.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.290
And and it hogged electrons
from here.

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.220
So there's a partial negative
charge, it's tempting for it

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.930
to disassociate with the
water molecules.

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.630
Well, in this case, yeah, it's
tempting, but it still like to

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:12.480
be hanging around.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.410
Oxygen is very

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:15.640
electronegative, but so is fluorine.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:17.170
So it likes to hang
around with both.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.530
So it kind of doesn't completely
disassociate.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.240
So that's why this one is a
hydrofluoric acid, is a weak

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.220
acid, while all of the other
halogenic acids are strong.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.500
Well, with that said, the point
of this isn't to just

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.720
look at the periodic table.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.630
Let's figure out what the pH is
when I dissolve-- let's say

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:50.460
I have 1.5 molar of
hydrofluoric acid.

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.740
And obviously, by definition,
since I've given this as

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.605
molarity, I have it
in some solutions.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:59.320
In this case, I have it in
an aqueous solution.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.760
Now.

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.790
You could look it up.

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:02.950
Well actually, I'll
just write it.

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:08.285
So every equilibrium reaction
has some equilibrium constant.

00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:11.380
So the equilibrium constant for
this reaction-- I'll do it

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:16.080
in green-- and since this is an
acidic reaction, we'll say

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:19.960
it's the equilibrium constant,
or an acid constant, however

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.230
you want to say it, for
hydrogen fluorine.

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.800
Hydrofluoric acid.

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.395
Hydrofluoric acid is equal
to the products.

00:06:27.395 --> 00:06:34.140
So it's the concentration of
your hydrogen ions times your

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:40.650
concentration of your fluorine
ions divided by your

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.230
concentration of your hydrogen
fluoride, or

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.380
hydrofluoric acid.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:45.630
So HFl.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.700
And if you look this up at 25
degrees Celsius at roughly

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.280
room temperature-- I believe
that is, but let's say it is--

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:05.250
you get a constant value here of
7 times 10 to the minus 4.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.210
So if I have 1.5 molar of
hydrofluoric acid, can I

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.720
figure out what the pH is?

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:15.390
Remember, esssentially, I want
to solve for this right here.

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.370
If I solve for this, then
I know the hydrogen

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.110
concentration.

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.490
And then if I take the negative
log of that, then I

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.130
know its pH.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.400
So let's see if we
can do that.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:25.990
So.

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.990
I'm throwing 1.5 molar
onto this side of

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:30.880
the equation, right?

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:34.440
But some of it's going to go
and form that stuff, right?

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.180
So let's say x molar
gets disassociated.

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.440
So on this side-- let me
see if I can do this.

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.250
So I'm throwing 1.5 molar
on this side.

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.290
Let's say x molar goes
to that side, right?

00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:54.910
And so let's say I have 1.5
molar on this side.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:58.460
Once I'm in equilibrium,
x goes to

00:07:58.460 --> 00:07:59.640
that side of the equation.

00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.700
Or x reacts to form this
stuff, right here.

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.230
Disassociates.

00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:08.700
So once I'm in equilibrium, I'll
have my concentration of

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:13.860
hydrogen fluoride will
be 1.5 molar minus x.

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.610
And what's my concentration
of hydrogen?

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:20.990
Well, if x molar, or x moles of
this, the way you can view,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:24.405
disassociate, then we have x
moles or x molar of that.

00:08:24.405 --> 00:08:26.590
And we'll also have
x molar of that.

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:27.390
Right?

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.610
If one of the disassociates,
then you get one of that and

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:30.540
one of that.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:33.250
So these will be the equilibrium
concentrations.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.559
And I think you can smell some
algebra coming our way.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.840
So these are the equilibrium
concentrations.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.809
Let's see if we can
solve for x.

00:08:42.809 --> 00:08:45.360
So we know what the equilibrium
constant is.

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:48.520
It's 7 times 10 to
the minus fourth.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.860
We know that the final
equilibrium concentration of

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:56.710
our hydrofluoric acid is the
original 1.5 molar we put in,

00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:00.130
minus whatever disassociates
into the stuff up here.

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:04.550
And since x disassociated this
stuff here, I have x molar of

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.900
hydrogen, and I have
molar of fluoride.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:10.400
This is just pure algebra now.

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.440
Let's see if we can
solve this.

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.260
So this is equal to--
I'm going to

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:18.090
need space to do this.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.350
So we get 7 times 10
to the minus 4.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:25.510
Let's multiply both sides
times 1.5 minus x.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.310
Times 1.5 minus x.

00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.850
Is equal to

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:31.450
x times x, is equal
to x squared.

00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:36.290
And then if we multiply-- 7
times 10 to the minus fourth

00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:41.330
times-- 7 times 1.5,
that's 10.5, right?

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:47.230
So we have 10.5 times 10
to the minus fourth.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:48.700
That's that times that.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:54.950
Minus 7 times 10 to
the minus fourth x

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.420
is equal to x squared.

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:00.740
This looks complicated, but
it's just a quadratic

00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:03.240
equation, and there's
many videos on that.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.440
So let's just throw all of
this stuff onto to the

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:06.850
right-hand side because
I like having a

00:10:06.850 --> 00:10:09.530
positive coefficient here.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.290
So if I subtract this from both
sides and add this to

00:10:13.290 --> 00:10:21.590
both sides, I get 0 is equal
to x squared, plus this, so

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:26.010
plus 7 times 10 to the minus
fourth x, right?

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:28.370
I just add this to both sides,
so it shows up on this side of

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:30.120
the equation, which
is right here.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.740
Minus this.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.370
I'm subtracting this from both
sides of the equation.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:39.850
So I get minus 10.5 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:10:39.850 --> 00:10:43.540
Now, this is a quadratic
equation here.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:47.170
And actually, I'll throw
you a little--

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.590
We can solve this quadratic
equation.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:49.140
We'll get the answer.

00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.870
In fact, I'm about
to solve it.

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:55.550
But there is an approximation
you can do.

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:58.400
Because if you look at this
quadratic equation, this term

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:03.330
here, x squared, dominates
this term right here.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:06.460
Even when you have relatively
small values of x, it

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.890
dominates that term.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.020
So if chemists look at
this and they say

00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:11.270
hey, you know what?

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:18.450
If this term is so much smaller
than what's going on

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:20.810
here, in a lot of the cases,
you might be able

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:21.590
to just ignore it.

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.310
And then the problem becomes
very simple.

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.250
Because if you ignore this term,
it's still a quadratic,

00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.850
but you don't have to use
a quadratic equation.

00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:30.420
Actually I'll do it on
the side right here.

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.140
I'll just do it in a box.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.020
Because this isn't the exact
answer, but it's going to get

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.640
it's pretty close to
the exact answer.

00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:40.120
So in this-- I'll make a
nice little box here.

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.760
I'll make a box.

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:47.490
So if we just ignored this term,
then we'd have x squared

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:49.600
is equal to this.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:53.820
Is equal to minus-- you would
add this to the other side, so

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.070
you would have plus 10.5 times
10 to the minus 4.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.865
Or x would be equal do the
square root of this.

00:12:00.865 --> 00:12:07.030
x would be equal to-- what?

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:13.420
See, 10.5-- I see you have to
put the exponent thing here.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:20.120
So exponent for minus
all right.

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.460
And I want to take the square
root, so to the 0.5 power is

00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:29.040
equal to 0.0324.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:32.880
So this is 0.0324.

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:36.320
So if we make that simplifying
assumption, we've essentially

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.400
solved four our hydrogen
concentration, right?

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.980
That was x.

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:40.780
This is x.

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.380
So this is 0.0324.

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:48.880
And if we want to figure out
the pH, we just take the

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.930
negative log of this.

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.230
So let's do that.

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.460
So you take the log of it.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.045
If you just press log,
that's base 10.

00:12:56.045 --> 00:12:58.170
So you take the log.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.550
And we want the negative of
that, so you just say minus

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:05.290
1.489, so about 1.49.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:08.710
So it's a pH of 1.49.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.400
But remember, I did that using
my little simplifying

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:11.725
assumption.

00:13:11.725 --> 00:13:14.090
It does not solve the
quadratic equation.

00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:16.670
Now let's solve it, just to kind
of confirm in our heads

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:18.240
that we get the right answer.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.580
Because that's actually
the right way to

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.460
get the right answer.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.150
So quadratic equation.

00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:24.050
Minus b.

00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:27.220
So x is going to be equal
to-- let me do it here.

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.230
x is equal to minus b.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:34.610
So minus 7 times 10 to the
minus 4 plus or minus the

00:13:34.610 --> 00:13:38.030
square root of b squared.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:45.280
So b squared is 49 times 10
to the minus 8, right?

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280
7 squared.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.200
And then 10 to the
minus 4 squared.

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:52.040
Is minus 4 times 2 is minus 8.

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:56.810
Minus 4 times a, which
is 1, times c.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:00.110
Well, c is a minus sign there--
we have this minus

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:01.550
sign, so it becomes plus.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:05.360
So 4 times 10.5 times 10
to the negative 4.

00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:05.860
That's what?

00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:12.390
That's 42 times 10 to the
minus fourth power.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:13.690
All of that over 2a.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.730
a is just 1.

00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:19.730
All of that over 2.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.610
So let's see what we
can get in this

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.200
square root right here.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:28.220
And notice, this is a very small
number compared to this.

00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:30.390
This is really all we should
care about with the square

00:14:30.390 --> 00:14:32.020
root, but let's just do it.

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:42.970
So 49 e 8 negative plus, so
that's that small number--

00:14:42.970 --> 00:14:50.560
plus 42 times 10 to the
negative-- or to the 4

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.200
negative, is equal to that.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.940
So that's this value
right here.

00:14:55.940 --> 00:14:57.740
And now we want to take
the square root.

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.570
So to the 0.5 power
is equal to 0.06.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:08.680
So so far, we get x is equal
to-- I will arbitrarily switch

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.050
colors-- minus 7 times
10 to the minus 4

00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:16.940
plus or minus 0.0648.

00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:21.250
All of that over 2.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:22.750
And it should be clear.

00:15:22.750 --> 00:15:26.950
If we subtract it right here,
we get a negative number.

00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.640
This is already a negative, so
if we subrtact it, we get a

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.160
negative numbers.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.150
So let's just worry about the
plus sign because we can't

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.180
have a negative concentration.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:39.300
So if we add that to this right
there, so we have 0.06,

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.470
and then we have minus--

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.200
Actually let me make sure
that the minus is there.

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.170
So it's minus 7 times 10.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:54.310
Right.

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.450
I just want to make sure I'm
not making a mistake by

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.700
putting a minus there.

00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:00.210
No.

00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:01.660
It looks right.

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:04.830
So let's see.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.350
So we just do our math.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:09.120
So we take this and
we subtract that.

00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:13.620
So it's minus-- I want
to make sure you can

00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:15.540
see what I'm doing.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:30.370
So we have minus 7 e 4 negative
is equal to that and

00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.900
then we have to divide by 2.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:37.610
Divided by 2 is equal
to 0.032.

00:16:37.610 --> 00:16:41.100
So 0.032.

00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.170
And remember, this is our
hydrogen concentration.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:46.540
It's also going to be our
concentration of, of course,

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.440
our fluorine ions.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.440
We don't care about that.

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.230
We just want to figure
out the pH.

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:54.670
So this is 0.032, which
is very close to our

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.510
approximation before.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.310
But now we have the
exact number.

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.180
So let's take the log
of it, and then take

00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:00.970
the minus of that.

00:17:00.970 --> 00:17:03.150
So the log of that.

00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:05.990
And then you want to put a minus
in front of the log.

00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:08.920
So the exact pH is
right there.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:17.310
So our pH of hydrofluoric
acid is equal to 1.49.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:19.869
So once again, pretty low pH.

00:17:19.869 --> 00:17:28.020
But notice, this pH--
this is 1.5 molar of

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.850
hydrofluoric acid.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:37.060
While 1 molar of hydrochloric
acid was even more acidic.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.110
It had a pH of 0.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:42.190
So even though we put more acid
here, we didn't get our

00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:46.810
pH as low as when we used only
1 molar of hydrochloric acid.

00:17:46.810 --> 00:17:49.160
Anyway, see you in
the next video.
