00:00:07.124 --> 00:00:11.153
Professor Fukanō, the famous 
eccentric scientist and adventurer,

00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:13.254
has embarked on a new challenge:

00:00:13.254 --> 00:00:17.894
flying around the world nonstop
in a plane of his own design.

00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:22.434
Able to travel consistently at the
incredible speed of one degree longitude

00:00:22.434 --> 00:00:24.645
around the equator per minute,

00:00:24.645 --> 00:00:28.725
the plane would take six hours
to circle the world.

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:30.243
There's just one problem:

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:34.335
the plane can only hold 180 kiloliters
of fuel,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:37.576
only enough for exactly half the journey.

00:00:37.576 --> 00:00:38.465
Let's be honest.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.816
The professor probably could have
designed the plane to hold more fuel,

00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.695
but where's the fun in that?

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.605
Instead, he's devised a slightly more
elaborate solution:

00:00:47.605 --> 00:00:51.575
building three identical planes
for the mission.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.056
In addition to their speed,

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.525
the professor's equipped them
with a few other incredible features.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:59.046
Each of the planes can turn on a dime

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:04.026
and instantly transfer any amount
of its fuel to any of the others in midair

00:01:04.026 --> 00:01:05.415
without slowing down,

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:07.795
provided they're next to each other.

00:01:07.795 --> 00:01:09.876
The professor will pilot the first plane,

00:01:09.876 --> 00:01:14.686
while his two assistants Fugōri
and Orokana will pilot each of the others.

00:01:14.686 --> 00:01:18.237
However, only one airport,
located on the equator,

00:01:18.237 --> 00:01:20.787
has granted permission for the experiment,

00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:22.316
making it the starting point,

00:01:22.316 --> 00:01:23.456
the finish line,

00:01:23.456 --> 00:01:25.736
and the only spot where 
the planes can land,

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:26.855
takeoff,

00:01:26.855 --> 00:01:28.816
or refuel on the ground.

00:01:28.816 --> 00:01:30.717
How should the three planes coordinate

00:01:30.717 --> 00:01:35.487
so the professor can fly continuously
for the whole trip and achieve his dream

00:01:35.487 --> 00:01:38.576
without anyone running out 
of fuel and crashing?

00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:42.246
Pause here if you want 
to figure it out for yourself.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:43.656
Answer in: 3

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:44.656
Answer in: 2

00:01:44.656 --> 00:01:46.118
Answer in: 1

00:01:46.118 --> 00:01:48.187
According to the professor's calculations,

00:01:48.187 --> 00:01:51.398
they should be able to pull it off
by a hair.

00:01:51.398 --> 00:01:55.457
The key is to maximize the support
each assistant provides,

00:01:55.457 --> 00:01:58.677
not wasting a single kiloliter of fuel.

00:01:58.677 --> 00:02:01.007
It also helps us to think symmetrically

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:03.810
so they can make shorter trips
in either direction

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.267
while setting the professor up for a long
unsupported stretch in the middle.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:09.838
Here's his solution.

00:02:09.838 --> 00:02:13.117
All three planes take off at noon
flying west,

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:16.488
each fully loaded with 180 kiloliters.

00:02:16.488 --> 00:02:19.850
After 45 minutes, or one-eighth
of the way around,

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.314
each plane has 135 kiloliters left.

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:27.828
Orokana gives 45 to the professor
and 45 to Fugōri,

00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:29.989
fully refueling them both.

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.441
With her remaining 45, 
Orokana returns to the airport

00:02:33.441 --> 00:02:36.778
and heads to the lounge
for a well-deserved break.

00:02:36.778 --> 00:02:39.958
45 minutes later, with one-quarter
of the trip complete,

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:45.009
the professor and Fugōri
are both at 135 kiloliters again.

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:48.548
Fugōri transfers 45 
into the professor's tank,

00:02:48.548 --> 00:02:52.148
leaving himself with the 90
he needs to return.

00:02:52.148 --> 00:02:55.478
Professor Fukanō stretches
and puts on his favorite album.

00:02:55.478 --> 00:02:57.309
He'll be alone for a while.

00:02:57.309 --> 00:03:01.459
In the meantime, Orokana has been
anxiously awaiting Fugōri's return,

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.009
her plane fully refueled and ready to go.

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:10.659
As soon as his plane touches the ground,
she takes off, this time flying east.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:14.059
At this point, exactly 180 minutes 
have passed

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.260
and the professor is at the halfway point
of his journey

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.069
with 90 kiloliters of fuel left.

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:21.579
For the next 90 minutes,

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.749
the professor and Orokana's planes 
fly towards each other,

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.511
meeting at the three-quarter mark.

00:03:27.511 --> 00:03:29.990
Just as the professor's fuel 
is about the run out,

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.110
he sees Orokana's plane.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.291
She gives him 45 kiloliters 
of her remaining 90,

00:03:35.291 --> 00:03:37.970
leaving them with 45 each.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.049
But that's just half of what they need
to make it to the airport.

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:46.680
Fortunately, this is exactly when Fugōri,
having refueled, takes off.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.280
45 minutes later, just as the other two
planes are about to run empty,

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:54.240
he meets them at the 315 degree point

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.920
and transfers 45 kiloliters of fuel
to each, leaving 45 for himself.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.620
All three planes land at the airport
just as their fuel gauges reach zero.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.010
As the reporters and photographers cheer,

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.541
the professor promises his planes will
soon be available for commercial flights,

00:04:11.541 --> 00:04:14.750
just as soon as they figure out how 
to keep their inflight meals

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.611
from spilling everywhere.
