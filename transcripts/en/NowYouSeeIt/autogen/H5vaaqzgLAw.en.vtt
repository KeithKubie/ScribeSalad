00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.340
Hollywood is a crazy world with an even
crazier history

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.360
it's conniving competitive and above all
risky I think to analyze movies it's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.480
important to understand the context
surrounding the production of the movie

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.640
not to mention it's also extremely
interesting

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.780
so let's separate Hollywood's life into
five distinct eras and see the thievery

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:39.330
desperation and failure in the industry
starting with the first movies actually

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.950
began far away from Hollywood California
all movies before 19/11 like the Great

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.850
Train Robbery and the first Frankenstein
movie were filmed entirely on the East

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.170
Coast in fact the all-too-familiar term
cliffhanger most likely originates from

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.250
a series called the peril of poly in
1914 which was filmed in the former

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.790
motion picture capital of the country
Fort Lee New Jersey the move to

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.970
Hollywood happened for several reasons
it was cheaper there was nice weather

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.810
year-round and California provided a lot
of distinct film locations nothing

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.900
illustrates this better than Paramount's
description of the region one reason

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.350
hardly talked about however is the fact
that these million dollar motion picture

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.190
industries were fleeing to California so
they could more easily break the law in

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.020
1891 Thomas Edison patented the kinetic
graph the technology used to film movies

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.190
with his patent he had a legal monopoly
on the entire industry even had control

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.549
over movie projectors and film
distributors Edison aggressively sued

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.750
many people using his invention going so
far as to hiring thugs to smash cameras

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.590
and raid independent studios filmmakers
like Fox and paramount had to flee to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.250
the west coast so they could make their
movies outside of Edison's influence so

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
technically any movie made before 1917
not from Thomas Edison's production

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.320
company was completely illegal in 1917
the United States Supreme Court ruled

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.159
his monopolies unlawful and against
public interest it's interesting how an

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.000
industry founded on breaking the rules
is now aggressively taking video essays

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.850
down on YouTube despite their obvious
fair use but I digress shall we try it

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.729
right food which cigar mr. Gordon

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.989
by the late 1910s America cinema
transitioned into what we're familiar

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:18.340
with the booming Hollywood industry the
industry skyrocketed a key innovation

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.030
was the addition of dialogue in the late
1920s which kept the industry afloat

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.109
popular and innovative throughout the
Great Depression the era between 1917 in

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.129
the late 1940s is commonly referred to
as studio system Hollywood this is when

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:33.430
production companies had decade-long
contracts with actors directors and

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.790
writers if you think the movie industry
is monopolized now know that five

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.049
studios had control of absolutely
everything in the 1940s each major

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.919
company had ownership of actors
directors distribution and even the

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.340
movie theaters creators could only make
it an industry if they stuck with one

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.510
company for almost their entire careers
by signing long term and sometimes very

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.010
unfair contracts out of this era came
classics such as Gone with the Wind Snow

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.310
White and the Seven Dwarves and the
original King Kong one interesting

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.879
aspect of this time period is that with
so many movies being made and so many

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.060
people flocking to the theater movie
companies could afford producing movies

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.540
with medium sized budgets and scripts
that weren't necessarily blockbuster

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.229
material like Citizen Kane and
Casablanca nowadays big companies pull

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:18.129
most of their time and resources into
several big-budget movies a year which

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.849
is quite a shame

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.630
the end of this era came from another
battle with the courts the Supreme Court

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.960
ruled against Paramount Pictures saying
ownership of the theaters and

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.620
distribution of their films was a
restriction of fair trade this loss of

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.860
control of distribution protected
independent filmmakers but meant to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:42.280
decline in the big industry the next
head to movie popularity was television

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.340
television hurt the industry since many
people could stay at home to get their

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.150
entertainment movie viewership plummeted
in the 30s 60% of people went to the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.540
movie theaters at least once a week but
since the 1960's the number has

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.710
consistently stuck around only 10
percent to combat TV movies had to do

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.090
what TV couldn't do big screens and big
budgets the Hollywood epic came into

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.750
fruition this is when movies got
absolutely insane cinema scope lenses

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.080
stretched the screen to almost twice the
size of conventional film there were

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.310
movies like Cleopatra in 1963 which was
the highest grossing film of the year

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.940
and still didn't make back its budget
one of his huge hundred-foot set pieces

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.600
had to be built twice in two separate
countries because the lead Elizabeth

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.960
Taylor got sick soon the new Hollywood
era broke through starting with Bonnie

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.920
and Clyde film school train directors
gained major influence in the industry

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.520
as opposed to the producers of old
Hollywood with low-budget hits like jaws

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.150
by Steven Spielberg Star Wars by George
Lucas and the Godfather by Francis

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.720
Coppola producers gave more control to
the filmmakers who in turn produced more

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.740
provocative diverse and innovative
movies personally I find this atmosphere

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.830
the most conducive to amazing filmmaking
but it came at a price

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.550
with such freedom several films got way
out of hand many directors took their

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:58.210
power too far in movie budgets
skyrocketed out of control Apocalypse

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.720
Now is an extreme example there's a
documentary on the production process of

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.169
the movie called heart of darkness that
I absolutely recommend I cannot come

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.830
close to describing the mayhem of making
that movie in such a short video

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.640
hurricanes heart attacks a coup in the
country they filmed its crazy with

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.830
Apocalypse Now in 1979 in the box office
bomb Heaven's Gate in 1980 bankrupting a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.250
huge production company producers
tightened their grip on filmmakers which

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:25.270
makes absolute sense what happened was
in the 70s all those filmmakers that did

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:29.410
get final cut the budgets grew and grew
and each one one after the other had a

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.610
financial disaster that almost tore down
the studio's if you treat the movie

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.740
industry like an actual business it's
definitely

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.490
one of the riskiest one movie the public
hates and it cripples the company

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.880
millions are on the line and with
continuously decreasing ticket sales

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.430
companies had to adapt now we're at the
movie industry as we know it today with

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.060
home video in the 90s and streaming
services like Netflix it's hardly worth

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.270
it to drive all the way to a movie
theater anymore so companies make a

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.870
handful of movies and promote them like
crazy superhero and fantasy movies

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.050
dominate box office sales because those
are the movies that are worth seeing on

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.380
the big screen movies like pop star and
the nice guys bomb this year because

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.139
they're light comedies and frankly I'm
willing to wait for them to come to

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.139
Netflix in a couple months what's
amazing about this era is that it gets

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:15.340
easier and easier to make feature-length
movies I bought a used DSLR camera

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:19.810
tripod memory card case and editing
software for less than $600 you don't

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:23.020
need a huge movie conglomerate to get
your voice heard and your art noticed

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.590
Hollywood becomes more and more obsolete
every day so pick up your iPhone hit

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.630
record and say action thanks for
watching here it is the cool slightly

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:36.699
trans for just a bit of a break from the
norm just a little something to break

00:06:36.699 --> 00:06:40.229
the monotony of all that
