[upbeat piano music]

00:00:09.507 --> 00:00:11.507
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.923
Bi-pedal, naked, large brained,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.630
long the master of fire,
tools, and language

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.023
but still trying to understand ourselves,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.820
aware that death is inevitable

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.683
yet filled with optimism,
we grow up slowly,

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.293
we hand down knowledge,
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.410
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.693
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.170
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.703
to exchange insights on who
we are and how we got here,

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.130
an exploration made possible by

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.513
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:27.842 --> 00:01:29.925
[upbeat electronic music]

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.650
- Okay, so I'm an old low ranking male

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.562
so that means I should be good at hunting

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:45.885
(laughter)

00:01:45.885 --> 00:01:47.270
but it kind of depresses me to think

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.120
that the measure of success
is how good a hunter we are.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.970
I'm a vegetarian, well almost,

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.120
so that's what I'd like to be,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.621
but still it's an important
issue so let's talk about this.

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:03.940
I want to talk about the
origins of what I'll call

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.860
the Human Predatory
Pattern, and the reason

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.640
I'm calling it that is because that's what

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.060
Jessica Thompson and
colleagues are calling it

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.490
in a paper in press in
Current Anthropology

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.650
emphasizing the fact that Hominins

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.150
are killing animals
larger than themselves.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.980
Chimps can kill animals the
same size of themselves,

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.653
namely other adult Chimpanzees,

00:02:25.653 --> 00:02:30.000
but they don't eat them
and humans of course,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.870
are different in this respect.

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.089
So, the standard kind of model

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:37.720
which is in someways the justification

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.820
for the material we've been
hearing about Chimpanzees,

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.550
is that you have a lost common ancestor

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.090
that was hunting in the Chimp-style

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.560
and then out of that comes
the Human Predatory Pattern

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.650
and then a slight modification of that

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
comes from people like
the Jessica Thompson team

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.270
and I think, Briana,
where you can have that

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.630
chimp-style hunting and then,
in the Australopithecine era

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.660
they may or may not be hunting very much,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.380
difficult for them to catch red colobus,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.305
not to many around in the Savannah,

00:03:11.305 --> 00:03:15.610
but still interested in
meat and animal products,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.820
and then out of that you
get maybe an interest in

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.450
fat-processing, from the
marrow and other organs,

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.860
and out of that, coming the
scavenging then hunting,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.090
but here's my point, all of this

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.583
assumes that the stuff is eaten raw.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.090
Well that conforms to conventional wisdom.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.000
Conventional wisdom
sees Australopithecines

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.090
giving rise to Homo erectus
then Homo heidelbergensis

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.430
and finally, the finest
kind of human you can have,

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.617
represented here by the
President of Harvard,

00:03:48.617 --> 00:03:51.587
(laughter)

00:03:51.587 --> 00:03:54.502
emerging out of the President of Yale

00:03:54.502 --> 00:03:56.752
(laughter)

00:04:04.016 --> 00:04:06.810
and the point of course
is that the standard story

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.980
is that this was raw
meat that was responsible

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.440
for this big transformation,
nothing much happening

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.710
after we get Homo erectus,
and that fire comes in

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.742
some time quite a lot
later, and maybe that's true

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:23.620
but I doubt it myself, I think
that fire came in earlier

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.560
but what is certainly
true is that raw meat

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:30.478
is a difficult food for people nowadays.

00:04:30.478 --> 00:04:32.840
It's rare to find hunters and gatherers

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.910
eating raw meat at all as you see

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.350
from this survey around the world

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.609
and in Africa, there is no
record of people eating raw meat

00:04:41.609 --> 00:04:46.500
and to the extent that we have data

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.990
on what happens when
people do eat raw meat,

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.240
which we have to go to urban raw-foodists,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.323
people who are able to survive
on supermarkets and so on.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.406
What you find following the red line here

00:04:58.406 --> 00:05:03.406
is that raw food is a
great way of losing weight.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.380
It shows that you lose body mass index

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.007
quite predictably by eating
a lot of your diet raw

00:05:14.007 --> 00:05:16.700
and this includes both vegans and

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.600
people who are eating their meat raw.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.700
And then the blue line shows you that

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.445
raw food is quite a good
contraceptive, too, because

00:05:23.445 --> 00:05:25.400
(laughter)

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.550
by the time you're eating
50 percent of your food raw,

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.780
if you are a woman, sorry,
100 percent of your food raw,

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.030
50 percent chance of having
your reproductive system

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.490
totally shut down and
that is despite the fact

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.300
that they're eating just
about as high quality

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.850
of a raw diet as you can imagine

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.740
and having no seasonal stresses and so on.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.790
It's quite clear that
cooking does something.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.420
It increases the energy value, we know,

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:58.750
for starch and protein and plant lipids.

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.110
Now here is the fact
that you should remember

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.540
among, beyond anything else
that I'm going to say today,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.130
nobody knows what the consequence
is of cooking animal fats.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.010
We do know about cooking plant lipids,

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.730
that it increases the
digestibility of the plant lipids,

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:15.500
you get more energy value out of it,

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.460
but no one has done it with animal fats,

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.050
which is crazy, and if
you think about the fact

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.015
of how much more delicious
a lump of suet is

00:06:24.015 --> 00:06:27.150
when it's been cooked,
then it seems very likely

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.130
that you're food perception system is tied

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:34.070
to the consequences
biologically in your body,

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.630
but the fact is that were not sure

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:40.510
so it seems very likely that
raw meat has got low value

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:45.087
compared to both cooked meat,
I mean that's what we do know,

00:06:45.087 --> 00:06:48.280
and a point I want to say here, is marrow.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.865
What I want to emphasize here is that

00:06:50.865 --> 00:06:53.830
the consequences of cooking meat

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.990
are very substantially beneficial.

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.006
The consequences of cooking marrow

00:06:58.006 --> 00:07:02.325
with its fat content may be a bit less,

00:07:02.325 --> 00:07:04.730
so we'll think about
this in terms of safety

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:08.180
and palatability and time to ingest.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.787
I'm not going to talk about digestibility

00:07:10.787 --> 00:07:13.200
and the cost of digestion
because we don't know anything

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.660
in terms of the marrows
so that's really crazy,

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:18.660
one of the most important foods
probably in human evolution,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.010
fat from animals, and
cooking, the signature feature

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:24.795
of the human diet, and yet we don't know

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:29.650
what the consequence is of
cooking fat for the energy gain.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:33.510
Alright, so we know cooking
is biologically important.

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.670
We know it raises the food value,

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:36.410
probably does it differently
for different foods.

00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:39.600
I want to propose
something that will annoy

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.770
several of my colleagues which is

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:46.410
that before cooking Hominin
meat-eating was less important

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.883
and Hominin fat-eating was more important.

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.664
So the first thing I want to say is about

00:07:52.664 --> 00:07:57.664
the dangers of eating from a dead zebra

00:07:57.830 --> 00:07:59.400
that you happen to find there.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.333
It is disgusting.
(laughter)

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.025
Sonia Ragir pointed out some time ago

00:08:09.025 --> 00:08:12.470
that the meat is
dangerous when you find it

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.303
because of bacterial
growth and Alex Smith,

00:08:16.303 --> 00:08:19.177
in my lab did some nice experiments

00:08:19.177 --> 00:08:23.230
showing that if you compare
the rate of bacterial growth

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.520
on raw meat compared to
marrow, that it grows

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:31.920
much faster on raw meat
and whereas if you cook it

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.600
then it's safe for very quickly

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.630
and internal marrow is really safe

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:39.910
so meat you can sometimes get away with

00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:44.330
cutting outside bits in, off,
and taking what's inside,

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.810
but even then, it decays pretty quickly

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.300
and it is going to remain rather dangerous

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:52.270
which I think is why chimpanzees,

00:08:52.270 --> 00:08:55.130
by the way, don't scavenge much.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:56.330
If there was implication earlier

00:08:56.330 --> 00:08:59.160
that they sort of don't
recognize dead meat as food,

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.193
I think they do, it's just that

00:09:00.193 --> 00:09:01.720
they're pretty cautious about it

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.710
and occasionally they
do, they do scavenge.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.360
Okay, so here's my major
point I want to make,

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.625
that Hominins without
fire couldn't hunt much

00:09:09.625 --> 00:09:13.420
cause there's just not
much time for hunting.

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.830
So here is the data on the amount of time

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.020
that chimpanzees spend feeding

00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:19.273
which is incredibly frustrating

00:09:19.273 --> 00:09:21.080
to teams from National Geographic

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.270
that come and want to see
chimps doing fancy things,

00:09:23.270 --> 00:09:25.160
cause in fact all they do is sit there

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.960
eating most of the time
and there's variation

00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.780
among the sites and
the ones at the bottom,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.510
Bassou, they're eating
quite a lot of human foods

00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.573
dug up from fields, that sort of thing,

00:09:36.573 --> 00:09:40.940
but overall, we got, close
on, 50 percent of their day

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.490
is spent literally just chewing

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.310
and that means that they
can't do other things,

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:49.403
such as write poetry or go hunting.

00:09:49.403 --> 00:09:51.750
(laughter)

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:53.930
So here what we've got is a strange plot

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:56.440
of the distribution of time spent feeding

00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.180
in non-human primates and you see

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:04.140
there's a pretty steady
rise as body size increases

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.810
on the bottom axis and so by the time

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:09.080
you are a Homo you should be eating,

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.030
for something like chewing,
for something like 50

00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.570
to actually slightly higher
than 50 percent of the day.

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.640
That's what you should
be doing, but you're not

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.030
and in fact, what humans do is

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:21.374
they chew for less than an hour a day.

00:10:21.374 --> 00:10:23.610
It's a relatively trivial time

00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:28.100
and meat eating does not help that much

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:31.853
if you are a raw eater,
so here is some estimates

00:10:31.853 --> 00:10:33.680
that is difficult to get normally

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.650
for how much total time
it takes to chew a carcass

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:40.710
because it's relatively
rare that you can see

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:42.435
all the different bits of the carcass

00:10:42.435 --> 00:10:45.210
and how much they have
been eaten by chimps

00:10:45.210 --> 00:10:47.590
but this suggests that when you take,

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.567
for instance, a baboon that
weighs a certain amount

00:10:49.567 --> 00:10:51.890
and you estimate 80
percent of it was eaten,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:54.410
and you total up all
the eating that was done

00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:56.250
during that period that you could see

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.440
is a total of 9 chimpanzee-hours

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.440
and the net result is
that you're eating meat

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.730
at about the rate that you are some of the

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:07.660
higher quality fruits in
terms of calorie intake.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.893
There's a note here saying that Ian Gilby

00:11:09.893 --> 00:11:14.893
thinks that I'm underestimating
the rate of eating

00:11:15.125 --> 00:11:18.240
and I'm sure I'm underestimating
it from the initial phase

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.407
of eating, when they're
eating the softer bits,

00:11:20.407 --> 00:11:22.730
but we have yet to get
very good data on this,

00:11:22.730 --> 00:11:26.090
so it may turn out that the
underestimate is important,

00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:28.828
but nevertheless, that's
what we got so far.

00:11:28.828 --> 00:11:33.828
Chimps don't hunt for very long at a time.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:38.045
Here you see some estimates,
all between 15 minutes

00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:40.940
and half an hour, that sort of thing,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.560
if they get into a hunt, and after that,

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.351
there, they give up.

00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:49.351
This is not effected by how
often they're overall killing,

00:11:50.066 --> 00:11:53.280
there's this big range
that we've seen before,

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.450
sometimes like one a month
and sometimes ten a month,

00:11:56.450 --> 00:11:59.998
but nevertheless, they're
always having this low rate,

00:11:59.998 --> 00:12:04.100
this low duration of the
hunt and you can see why,

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:06.450
here is how the feeding
time is distributed

00:12:06.450 --> 00:12:09.330
in a particular individual
from dawn until dusk.

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:12.170
The red is when he's chewing,
so there's just not much time

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.350
between chewing, and by the way,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:14.960
when they stop chewing,
what are they doing?

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:17.690
They're mostly lying around in order

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:19.276
to be able to digest the food.

00:12:19.276 --> 00:12:20.170
(laughter)

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.250
So the typical pattern
is, you go up into a tree,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.367
you eat for 45 minutes,
then you come and lie down,

00:12:24.367 --> 00:12:25.579
(laughter)

00:12:25.579 --> 00:12:26.790
and then wait for the
stomach to be emptied,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.122
and then you go up again, that's
what seems to be happening.

00:12:30.122 --> 00:12:30.955
So there's variation among chimps

00:12:30.955 --> 00:12:32.730
and here's a bunch of different days,

00:12:32.730 --> 00:12:35.810
you see some days there
is very little time

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:38.380
to do anything other than
eat and sometimes more

00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.365
and it bounces out across days and so on,

00:12:40.365 --> 00:12:42.150
but you can look at this and you can say,

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:45.200
okay let's look at the
inter-feeding interval.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.550
How much time is there
between what you gotta do,

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.012
which is to get food into your belly,

00:12:50.012 --> 00:12:55.012
and the answer is that
the median is 20 minutes,

00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:58.828
the mean of 40 minutes,
this is old data from Gombe

00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:02.080
but that compares with
the mean hunt duration

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.890
of quarter of an hour, half an hour,

00:13:04.890 --> 00:13:08.720
so it's about the same
and the implication here

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:10.720
is that if you are chewing a lot,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.510
there's just no time to
go hunting, so sorry.

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:15.300
Now humans, obviously we're much

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.850
less constrained by eating time

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.880
and actually funnily
enough there is no paper

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.660
that has looked at when humans eat,

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:25.840
but this looks like a
very confident assertion

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.070
that among hunter-gatherers
only one regular meal

00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:30.550
is eaten in camp, and it's the night after

00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:32.270
the people have returned
from the day's hunting.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.340
That's the sort of typical pattern,

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:37.063
particularly as you go into
the earlier ethnographies.

00:13:38.029 --> 00:13:42.950
Humans are able to spend
long hours during the day,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:46.620
on the hunt, and here you see distribution

00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:48.780
across different hunter gatherer societies

00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:52.736
for men and women, and the
men are spending on average,

00:13:52.736 --> 00:13:55.700
just over four hours a
day, which means that

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.240
it is possible for them to
do something that chimpanzees

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.063
could not possibly do,
and therefore, I think,

00:14:00.063 --> 00:14:05.063
that a raw meat-eating Hominin
could not have done either.

00:14:05.228 --> 00:14:10.228
Meanwhile, could they
go out and track around

00:14:10.468 --> 00:14:15.468
looking for their food, foraging, hunting?

00:14:16.357 --> 00:14:19.540
Dan Lieberman and his colleague Bramble

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:23.630
have drawn attention to
a whole bunch of features

00:14:23.630 --> 00:14:26.060
in our skeletons which indicate that Homo

00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:28.890
is uniquely derived an ability to have

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:31.160
endurance walking or endurance running

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.223
tramping around across the Savannah

00:14:33.223 --> 00:14:38.223
looking for opportunities to
either scavenge or to kill.

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:39.630
Well that doesn't seem very easy

00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:40.950
if you've got a great big belly

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:44.730
that we've just been hearing
about with those flared ribs

00:14:44.730 --> 00:14:47.380
and you're keeping it full
of stuff all the time.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:50.820
So you're asking a gorilla
full of vegetation,

00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:55.112
as it were, to go running
off two or three hours.

00:14:55.112 --> 00:14:56.950
I don't think so.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:59.920
I think they, one reason, is
that you've got a large gut

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.020
and that large gut is full for a

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:05.100
tremendous amount of the time and then,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.983
I actually think there's
probably another reason,

00:15:06.983 --> 00:15:09.407
this is a little speculative admittedly,

00:15:09.407 --> 00:15:14.407
but I think that the creatures before fire

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.730
would have needed to keep
warm at night with hair,

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.290
and as long as they had to do that,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.200
then they couldn't lose
heat easily during a day,

00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.700
so it's very difficult for me to imagine

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.880
an endurance runner in particular

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.820
being able to do that before fire.

00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.330
Okay, so what I'm saying so far,

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.960
is that meat eating would have been

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:38.233
less extensive before the control of fire,

00:15:38.233 --> 00:15:41.630
because of the lack of
safety in the raw meat

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:44.610
and the fact of chewing for so long

00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:48.468
meant that you had also
large guts full of food,

00:15:48.468 --> 00:15:53.468
you couldn't run and hunt, and I suspect

00:15:54.058 --> 00:15:57.100
when we know about it,
that the relative value

00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:59.279
of raw meat compared to raw fat

00:15:59.279 --> 00:16:02.023
is going to be relatively low.

00:16:03.059 --> 00:16:06.300
Okay, so what did Hominins
eat before cooking

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.740
because I do think that
it's reasonable to imagine

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:11.730
that there's been a phase in which

00:16:11.730 --> 00:16:15.570
Hominins were using animal
products before cooking

00:16:15.570 --> 00:16:20.570
and the safe bit are the ones
that are enclosed in bone

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.170
and that would be marrow or brain

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:25.540
from below the exposed surfaces

00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.080
is what you want to do and certainly,

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.550
marrow is an important food
for the hunter gatherers.

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.100
Here is data for the
Hadza and how many of them

00:16:35.100 --> 00:16:37.440
are eaten raw, so by the time
you're eating big animals

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.430
like buffalo, James Oliver
finds that 80 percent,

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.460
or 70 to 80 percent of the
limb bones are eaten raw

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.560
so that all seems just fine
but there would be a difference

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.640
if you're eating them
raw from eating cooked

00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.900
because nowadays there
is an ability to use

00:16:55.900 --> 00:17:00.030
both the marrow in the shaft of the bone

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.410
and the fat in the trebecula bone

00:17:04.410 --> 00:17:07.660
or the cancellous bone area which you,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.690
very difficult to get
out just with your teeth,

00:17:09.690 --> 00:17:11.020
you really have to boil it up

00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:13.040
to be able to release the grease

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.430
and until you have cooking, you're not

00:17:15.430 --> 00:17:17.840
going to be able to use that very much.

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.210
And then there's a difference
in the kind of marrow

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.944
that is going to be preferred.

00:17:22.944 --> 00:17:27.890
Binford showed very nicely that there is

00:17:27.890 --> 00:17:30.170
a good relationship between the degree of

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.780
unsaturated fat in the
marrow and the preference.

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:39.780
Here you see, for the Inuit
people that he was studying,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:43.280
that the more unsaturated marrow there is,

00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.030
then the more the bone is preferred,

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.710
so unsaturated is much
nicer than saturated fat

00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:55.780
when it's eaten raw, and
that is probably because

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.510
it has got a lower melting point,

00:17:58.510 --> 00:17:59.940
and with a lower melting point,

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.070
it probably, I think it'll turn out,

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.360
will turn out to have a
lower cost of digestion,

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.270
because the body is going
to have to work less hard

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.666
to reduce it to the tiny, tiny particles

00:18:10.666 --> 00:18:13.775
just a few angstroms across that have to

00:18:13.775 --> 00:18:18.233
be reduced before it can go
across the intestinal wall.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:22.900
So, where are the unsaturated fats found?

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.150
They are found more at the
nether ends of the limbs

00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.400
so if you take a typical ungulate foreleg

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:33.140
you find that the saturated
fats tend to be richer

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.670
close to the shoulder and
throughout the axial skeleton

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:41.670
and the unsaturated fats are
richer at the distal parts

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:44.520
which nobody understands why that is,

00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.790
I mean, there's the sort of suggestion

00:18:45.790 --> 00:18:49.333
well, unsaturated fats
having lower melting points,

00:18:50.286 --> 00:18:51.119
they're maybe sort of more flexible,

00:18:51.119 --> 00:18:53.345
they may allow more flexibility,

00:18:53.345 --> 00:18:55.683
but that's being a bit speculative.

00:18:56.527 --> 00:19:00.800
Okay, so, preference for unsaturated fats,

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:05.210
and then there's the question of brains,

00:19:05.210 --> 00:19:09.310
so the limb marrow is
great for most of the year,

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:13.410
but you see here in a couple of examples

00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:17.380
that femur marrow is very poor during

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.690
periods of the year when the
animals are in poor condition.

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:23.000
Going right down to 20 percent fat

00:19:24.035 --> 00:19:26.170
and that's a point
mirroring what's happening

00:19:26.170 --> 00:19:29.610
with the kidney fat,
at which you can expect

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.917
that there will be rejection of the food

00:19:31.917 --> 00:19:34.970
and so here's a claims from Binford,

00:19:34.970 --> 00:19:37.430
saying that if the Caribou is in

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.590
too poor condition,
you break open the bone

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.253
and it's soft and runny, then no, goodbye.

00:19:44.010 --> 00:19:47.156
During those periods,
brains should be okay.

00:19:47.156 --> 00:19:51.315
Here is Kim Hill saying that he loved,

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:54.800
well, he's saying that
the Ache and the Hiwi,

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:57.570
hunter gatherers in Paraguay and Venezuela

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.803
love brains and he says, grossly,
that he loved it himself.

00:20:01.683 --> 00:20:05.606
I asked him if he had it raw, he said no

00:20:05.606 --> 00:20:10.370
but you could, as long
as it's reasonably fresh,

00:20:10.370 --> 00:20:12.550
you know there is decay that goes on.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:14.070
Of course, the problem with brains

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:15.420
is that they're hard to extract

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:17.360
and if you're a Hominin they're embedded

00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:18.850
very often with things with horns,

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.390
and the skull is really heavy,

00:20:21.390 --> 00:20:23.590
so it's not that great, but it is good

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:28.590
because the quality of
the fat always stays high

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.870
and it's the last thing
that you will lose fat from,

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:36.340
and then, goodbye.
(laughter)

00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:41.340
So, my conclusion is that if
the early Homo diets were raw,

00:20:41.604 --> 00:20:44.010
then you've got to put up with the notion

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:46.300
that there was extensive chewing,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.780
minimal time for hunting, and I think,

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:52.140
no endurance running
and they would be eating

00:20:53.148 --> 00:20:56.770
particularly from the fat-rich areas

00:20:56.770 --> 00:20:59.460
and there'd be more marrow
than in cooked diets,

00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:02.470
there'd be more marrow
especially from the distal bones,

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.950
and especially from the brain.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:09.723
So overall, more scavenging,
more fat, and less meat.

00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:16.510
Overall, the kind of concept
that I was referring to earlier

00:21:17.230 --> 00:21:19.250
of chimpanzee-style hunting giving rise

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:20.550
to an interest in animal products

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:22.530
and then percussive fat-processing,

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.080
breaking open those limb-bones,

00:21:25.212 --> 00:21:29.484
and then finally getting
the Human Predatory Pattern,

00:21:29.484 --> 00:21:33.530
that seems to me a great
way to think about things,

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:37.080
and then we should think
about the first three stages

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:39.760
as involving raw meat, but I don't think

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.860
you can go very far into the fourth

00:21:41.860 --> 00:21:46.028
without making it cooked, so
I have a different concept

00:21:46.028 --> 00:21:50.042
of the Harvard and the Yale Presidents.

00:21:50.042 --> 00:21:50.875
(laughter)

00:21:50.875 --> 00:21:51.708
Thank you.

00:21:51.708 --> 00:21:53.958
(applause)
