00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.500
- [Instructor] After the Civil War

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.020
there were enormous
changes in American life.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.160
With industrialization, urbanization,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.810
and immigration changing
the composition of who lived

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.000
in the United States, where they lived,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.680
and what they did for a living.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.570
But city living and
factory work came with new

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.530
social problems like
poverty and unsafe working

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:23.880
and living conditions.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.950
The rise of big business
had also led to practices

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.070
that limited competition, like
monopolies and price fixing.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.680
Starting in the 1890s
a number of reformers

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.270
began to advocate for remedies
to these social problems.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:41.000
They were known as the Progressives.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.140
This era of reform, which
lasted through the 1920s,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.930
has come to be known
as the Progressive Era.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.190
But the difficult thing
about the Progressive Era

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.600
was that these reformers
worked on all sorts

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.680
of different things.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.610
There were muckrakers,
which were journalists,

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.390
writers, and photographers
who tried to expose

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.040
corruption or unsanitary
factory practices.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.300
There were politicians
who tried to reign in

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.070
big businesses and protect consumers.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.790
There were conservationists
who tried to preserve

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.750
national parks and
wilderness from exploitation.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.420
And there many influential
female reformers

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.880
who tried to help women,
children, and immigrants

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.640
achieve better working
and living conditions.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.240
So clearly Progressives didn't
all share the same goals

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.220
or advocate for the same
solutions to problems.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.270
How can we even compare
the goals and effects

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.530
of the Progressive reformers
when they were so diverse?

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.130
Let's start by taking a
look at some of the goals

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.300
and achievements of the Progressives.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.170
Now, I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.660
about individual reformers or
pieces of legislation here.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.000
What I'm interested in doing
is taking a birds eye view

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.990
of the kinds of reforms
that Progressives pursued

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.510
during this time period.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.460
First, there were those who
advocated for sanitation

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.910
and consumer protections
like Upton Sinclair,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.590
whose novel The Jungle exposed
the unsanitary conditions

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.920
in factories that made food products.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.610
The outrage that book
generated led to the passage

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.070
of laws like the Pure
Food and Drug Act of 1906.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.770
Then there were the
Progressives who fought

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.790
for protections for workers.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.230
They pushed for an eight hour workday

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.620
and for safer conditions for workers,

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.060
along with the right for workers

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.950
to bargain collectively through unions.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.980
Along with those reforms were others aimed

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.000
at advancing the rights
of women and children,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.250
including limiting child
labor, promoting access

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.330
to birth control, and granting
women the right to vote

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.850
through the 19th Amendment.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.300
Many of the Progressive
reformers were interested

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.780
in reining in the
excesses of big business.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.460
Politicians, like
President Teddy Roosevelt,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.650
went after trusts and monopolies

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.970
for stifling competition
and fixing prices.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.560
Another avenue of reform
was aimed at limiting

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.300
political corruption, particularly
city political machines

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.650
that were dominated by party bosses.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.730
One victory in this arena was the passage

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.210
of the 17th Amendment, which provided for

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.420
the popular election of senators.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:10.640
Lastly, there was a push for moral reform

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.620
to make society more orderly and humane.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.360
The major achievement of these reformers

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.410
was the passage of the 18th Amendment,

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.800
which prohibited the sale
or consumption of alcohol.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.530
Okay, so now that we've
done a brief survey

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.230
of what the Progressives were up to,

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.570
let's think about what
aspects these reformers

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.370
had in common with each other,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.930
and where they differed with
or contradicted each other.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.450
So this might sound a little obvious,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.820
but one thing that united the Progressives

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.410
was that they believed in progress.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.170
That is, they thought it was
possible to improve society

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.640
and to make people better human beings.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.420
This is worth mentioning
just because not everyone

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:48.880
felt that this was possible.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.750
Many of the opponents of the Progressives

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.310
saw human nature as
fixed and a society with

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.100
vast inequalities of
wealth and opportunity

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.570
is just an inevitable
consequence of industrialization.

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.130
A second shared belief
was that it was the role

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.430
of government to step in and
fix these social problems.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.350
This was a big departure
from the laissez-faire

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.170
or hands off approach of the Gilded Age.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.080
In that era, attempting
to improve sanitation

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.020
or morality would have been considered

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.810
work for private charities

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.410
or voluntary associations to take on.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.210
But the Progressives
thought that the problems

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.020
they were trying to solve were
too big for that approach.

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.070
And they sought out the
help of local, state,

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.990
and federal government to
implement their measures.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.230
They campaigned for laws and
constitutional amendments

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.630
to bring about change.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.840
So they really began a debate over whether

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.920
or to what extent the government
should take an active role

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.550
in the welfare of its
citizens that would continue

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.060
into the Great Depression.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.320
But the Progressive
Movement was also riddled

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.500
with divisions and
internal contradictions.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.570
One of these was around voting rights.

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.590
The Progressives expanded
democracy by winning

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.150
the right to vote for women,

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.930
but they also advocated
for restricting the vote

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.670
to who they considered good voters.

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.600
White, educated, native-born people.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.620
They worked to impose literacy tests

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.960
and residency requirements in the North,

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.410
and made no effort to
challenge Jim Crow Laws

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.250
preventing African Americans
from voting in the South.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.110
Progressives were also divided
on the issue of immigration.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.430
Although a few Progressives
championed the rights

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.450
of immigrants and respect
for immigrant's culture

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.950
like Hull-House founder, Jane Addams,

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.680
most Progressives thought the only way

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.450
forward for immigrants
was complete assimilation

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.950
into American culture.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:38.370
They also supported
restrictions on the entry

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.010
of immigrants they considered undesirable,

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:43.370
like those from Southern
and Eastern Europe,

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.030
Asia, and Mexico.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.974
These beliefs around who was fit to vote

00:05:47.974 --> 00:05:51.410
or to be an American citizen derived from

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.980
the flawed racial science of the day,

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.920
which categorized white
Anglo-Saxons as the most

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.410
evolved race, and everyone
else falling somewhere

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.790
along a continuum of less evolved peoples.

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.730
With the exception of
African American activists,

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:10.360
like Ida B. Wells, Progressive
reformers supported

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.480
segregation and pretty
much turned a blind eye

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.470
towards the working and living conditions

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.960
of African Americans.

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.950
Some Progressives even advocated eugenics,

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.720
a plan to improve the American gene pool

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.270
by encouraging native white
women to have more babies,

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.250
and discouraging undesirables
from reproducing,

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.960
sometimes through forced sterilizations.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.050
So taking these uniting
and dividing factors

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.120
into consideration what
conclusions can we come to

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.170
about the goals and effects

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:42.280
of the Progressive reform movement?

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.630
I think it's safe to say
that the Progressives

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.900
wanted to improve
society and find a remedy

00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:49.930
for the social problems caused by

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.590
industrialization and urbanization.

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:54.630
And that they wanted to do so through

00:06:54.630 --> 00:06:56.270
government intervention.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:58.480
But their goals were also limited.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.560
They only wanted these
improvements for those

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.530
they deemed worthy to
participate in American society.

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.410
As for how effective their
reforms were at solving

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:12.420
the problems of industrialization
and urbanization,

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.747
they did succeed in curbing
some of the worst problems

00:07:15.747 --> 00:07:20.280
of corruption, sanitation,
and exploitation.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:22.960
But we would also need to look ahead

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.560
to the '20s and '30s to see how much

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.220
things really changed.

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.600
Spoiler alert, this
booming era of industry

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.953
was about to end with a crash.
