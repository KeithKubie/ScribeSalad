1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,720
No, it's just to remind you, you
guys have a haze. Anybody at work,

2
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:06,330
I used to work in this
warehouse and we were,

3
00:00:06,331 --> 00:00:10,340
we were a bunch of fucking maniacs and
all day long, all we did was break balls.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:11,630
Uh,

5
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:16,220
I've told you this shit before because
we were basically mentally smart enough

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:20,000
to work in a warehouse by the time you
went third grade. You know what I mean?

7
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,630
It's supposed to be 10 boxes according
to the packing list. One, two, three,

8
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:27,020
four, five, six, seven, eight, nine,
10. There you go. One, two, three, four,

9
00:00:27,021 --> 00:00:31,730
five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,
12. Sorry, sesame street, flashback.

10
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,193
Um,

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,680
so we used to fuck around all the time
and our manager had no control over us.

12
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:41,490
You know, we didn't respect him.
We knew he wasn't gonna win fire.

13
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,680
We wasn't going to fire us. He
didn't have the goddamn heart.

14
00:00:43,681 --> 00:00:47,140
And at the end of the day we got a fucking
job done. So he decides that we're,

15
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,470
the problem is, is that
we're all too fucking young.

16
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,240
There's a level of immaturity out there.

17
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,230
Cause we were all in our early twenties
that we, uh, that he should hire.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,720
He hired this 38 year old guy.

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,410
Um,

20
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:02,270
I actually remember his
name, but I'm not gonna,

21
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,210
I don't name names on this
shit. And uh, Jesus Christ,

22
00:01:05,211 --> 00:01:06,890
that fucking guy's almost 60.

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,870
He was like 38 and that was
22 fucking years ago. He's 60.

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,930
What the fuck? So anyways,

25
00:01:15,931 --> 00:01:20,931
this guy drove a fucking sky blue Chevy
cavalier stationwagon four door bare

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,440
bones factory fucking rims. The
car was like three years old.

27
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:32,130
He had 8,000 miles on it. Alright.

28
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,690
And this guy was a Weirdo and
he had these fucking glasses,

29
00:01:36,691 --> 00:01:39,930
these black framed glasses
that nobody wore in the 80s.

30
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,320
So we immediately started calling
him warty we'd be, hey woody,

31
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,930
how many boxes we get over there?
And this guy was just bizarre.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,080
And he'd come over, why call me woody?
Are you trying to bring me down?

33
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,180
So he kept saying, you're
trying to bring me down.

34
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,120
Did I already tell this fucking story?
This sounds oddly familiar to me.

35
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:02,430
So we would just fuck with them.
We would just be like, okay,

36
00:02:02,431 --> 00:02:06,120
at four 31 today, everybody just
start going, what do you, what do you,

37
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:08,280
what are you, what are you in?
That's what we would do. He would be

38
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,240
picking orders down in the,

39
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,180
in the warehouse area and we would
all be picking orders with them.

40
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:17,710
And then out of nowhere
we would just start,

41
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,180
God, what do you, what do you, what
do you, what do you, what do you,

42
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:20,050
what do you, what do you,
what do you, what are you

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:24,700
top of our fucking lungs? I know
it's fucking am as sophomores,

44
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:27,850
but it would and what, we
wouldn't say it to him.

45
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,320
Okay.

46
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,540
We would just fucking be sitting.

47
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,970
It was really passive aggressive cause
he already talked to management about us

48
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:36,730
calling them woody. So it's like,
dude, we're not calling you woody.

49
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:40,570
We're just going woody, woody, woody,
woody, woody, look in your vicinity.

50
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,330
So we do the same thing.
You're trying to bring me down.

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,021
You're trying to beat me down.

52
00:02:44,021 --> 00:02:47,200
So eventually we haze this guy so
much that he fucking quit, right?

53
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:51,010
He and his little Chevy Cavalier fucking
four door sky blue bear bone station

54
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:54,580
wagon drove right out. And the back
of my head I was like, you know what,

55
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,590
I've got a bad feeling.
That mother coming back,

56
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,630
it was right right around the time
when people first started going postal.

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,790
So it wasn't enough that that we
actually drove this guy out of work.

58
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:11,290
What are they fucking maniacs I worked
with somehow got the guy's home phone

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:16,291
number and the following week he still
didn't have a job and he picked up the

60
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:21,020
phone. He's like, hello. And there was
10 of us standing around the phone,

61
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,100
right?

62
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,870
We all go, where do you, what do
you, what do you, what do you want?

63
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:25,980
Okay.

64
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,830
And I always pictured,

65
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,390
I'm slamming the phone down and then
looking up like that dude in a clockwork

66
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,810
work orange when he realizes the dude
who came and fucking kicked the shit out

67
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:39,580
of him and raped his wife came back.
Um, that's kind of an ugly story,

68
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,414
isn't it?

69
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:41,580
Okay.

70
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,241
You know, for, you know,

71
00:03:42,241 --> 00:03:45,330
for as much as people sit there and they
talk about this cyber bullying and all

72
00:03:45,331 --> 00:03:49,800
this type of shit and how fucking
horrible it is, which it is obviously,

73
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,210
uh, you know, I don't like how everybody
tries to act like they were a victim.

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,440
Well, I mean, weren't
you a little bit of both?

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,260
Cause I know I used to get bullied.

76
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:06,480
Jesus Christ walking up the street
looking like fucking that kid on the, uh,

77
00:04:06,481 --> 00:04:09,870
the f family Griffith.
What the fuck is that?

78
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,530
The honey Andy Griffith. How did I
come up with the family Griffith?

79
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,590
Ah, my fucking brain is
mush. MMM. Yeah. People,

80
00:04:21,591 --> 00:04:23,930
you immediately came walking
up the street. My fucking mind.

81
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,760
My hair was orange when I was growing up.

82
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:29,780
The guy didn't get the shit kicked out
of me, you know, but then, you know,

83
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:32,810
I got a little bit bigger. I
got a couple more freckles.

84
00:04:32,811 --> 00:04:36,050
I got got some more confidence and I
just started picking on kids who were a

85
00:04:36,051 --> 00:04:36,980
younger than I was.

86
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,720
So now whenever I see
those goddamn stories,

87
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,700
um, I just, I dunno, I,
I see both sides of it.

88
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,980
I just see like, yeah, you
shouldn't have fucking done that,

89
00:04:50,981 --> 00:04:55,740
but I don't judge the bully
cause I did shit like that. No,

90
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:58,790
you guys didn't do shit like
that. Go Fuck Yourself. All right.

91
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,140
Why don't you guys, do you know what?
That's the theme of this whole podcast.

92
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,400
Every can go fuck themselves.
