carl jung talked about this phenomena he

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670
carl jung talked about this phenomena he
 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:13.129
carl jung talked about this phenomena he
cried phenomenon he described as a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
cried phenomenon he described as a
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.919
cried phenomenon he described as a
retrogressive restoration of the persona

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929
retrogressive restoration of the persona
 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.599
retrogressive restoration of the persona
and so it's a complicated idea but

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609
and so it's a complicated idea but
 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.740
and so it's a complicated idea but
basically what it means is that

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750
basically what it means is that
 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.400
basically what it means is that
sometimes you take a leap forward and

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410
sometimes you take a leap forward and
 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.320
sometimes you take a leap forward and
you learn some things but you can't

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330
you learn some things but you can't
 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.450
you learn some things but you can't
catalyze a new identity so you try to go

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460
catalyze a new identity so you try to go
 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.339
catalyze a new identity so you try to go
back and hide in your old identity and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349
back and hide in your old identity and
 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.080
back and hide in your old identity and
that actually doesn't work because well

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
that actually doesn't work because well
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.850
that actually doesn't work because well
things have changed and you've learned

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860
things have changed and you've learned
 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.290
things have changed and you've learned
something and that isn't who you are

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300
something and that isn't who you are
 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.619
something and that isn't who you are
anymore and so it's like you have to cut

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629
anymore and so it's like you have to cut
 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.540
anymore and so it's like you have to cut
part parts of yourself off in a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550
part parts of yourself off in a
 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.940
part parts of yourself off in a
destructive manner to fit back into the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950
destructive manner to fit back into the
 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.410
destructive manner to fit back into the
person that you were now what happens

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420
person that you were now what happens
 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.139
person that you were now what happens
here is that Pinocchio escapes from this

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149
here is that Pinocchio escapes from this
 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.670
here is that Pinocchio escapes from this
tyrannical situation and undergoes this

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
tyrannical situation and undergoes this
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.350
tyrannical situation and undergoes this
descend into chaos but he tries to go

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360
descend into chaos but he tries to go
 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.970
descend into chaos but he tries to go
back home he tries to go back to what he

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
back home he tries to go back to what he
 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.779
back home he tries to go back to what he
was and he can't do that anymore his

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789
was and he can't do that anymore his
 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.330
was and he can't do that anymore his
father isn't at home anymore and so so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
father isn't at home anymore and so so
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520
father isn't at home anymore and so so
when he goes home he finds that there's

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530
when he goes home he finds that there's
 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.200
when he goes home he finds that there's
no home there now this happens to people

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210
no home there now this happens to people
 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.710
no home there now this happens to people
sometimes it's often a shock to them so

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720
sometimes it's often a shock to them so
 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.820
sometimes it's often a shock to them so
one of the things I've noticed about

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
one of the things I've noticed about
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.109
one of the things I've noticed about
peterpan type I'm going to speak about

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119
peterpan type I'm going to speak about
 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.420
peterpan type I'm going to speak about
men here because I served it more and

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430
men here because I served it more and
 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.810
men here because I served it more and
man is that they often stay under the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820
man is that they often stay under the
 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.010
man is that they often stay under the
thumb of their father and you think well

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020
thumb of their father and you think well
 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.240
thumb of their father and you think well
why would someone do that because it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
why would someone do that because it
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190
why would someone do that because it
means they're subject to the tyrannical

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
means they're subject to the tyrannical
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.749
means they're subject to the tyrannical
judgment of their father they're always

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
judgment of their father they're always
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.249
judgment of their father they're always
concerned about what their father would

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259
concerned about what their father would
 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:41.660
concerned about what their father would
think or whether their father approves

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670
think or whether their father approves
 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.560
think or whether their father approves
of them of them and so forth and you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570
of them of them and so forth and you
 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.969
of them of them and so forth and you
think well that's going to be an

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
think well that's going to be an
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.410
think well that's going to be an
unpleasant place to be why would you do

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
unpleasant place to be why would you do
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.990
unpleasant place to be why would you do
that one of the things that I've

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
that one of the things that I've
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.450
that one of the things that I've
suggested to my clients and other people

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460
suggested to my clients and other people
 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.219
suggested to my clients and other people
sometimes is that here's a weird little

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229
sometimes is that here's a weird little
 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.499
sometimes is that here's a weird little
exercise that you can undertake a little

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509
exercise that you can undertake a little
 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.819
exercise that you can undertake a little
thought experiment so you have your

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829
thought experiment so you have your
 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.800
thought experiment so you have your
parents and of course your parents have

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810
parents and of course your parents have
 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.330
parents and of course your parents have
friends who are about their age and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340
friends who are about their age and
 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.550
friends who are about their age and
maybe some of them are people you only

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560
maybe some of them are people you only
 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.949
maybe some of them are people you only
know peripherally

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959
know peripherally
 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.949
know peripherally
and I might ask you well do you care

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959
and I might ask you well do you care
 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.750
and I might ask you well do you care
more about what your parents think then

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760
more about what your parents think then
 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.610
more about what your parents think then
you care about what these peripheral

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620
you care about what these peripheral
 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.309
you care about what these peripheral
people who know your parents think and

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319
people who know your parents think and
 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.539
people who know your parents think and
then the answer to that is well of

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549
then the answer to that is well of
 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.789
then the answer to that is well of
course and then the question that arises

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799
course and then the question that arises
 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:30.640
course and then the question that arises
out of that is why I mean for someone

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650
out of that is why I mean for someone
 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.259
out of that is why I mean for someone
else your parents are the peripheral

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269
else your parents are the peripheral
 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420
else your parents are the peripheral
people and their parents are central

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430
people and their parents are central
 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.000
people and their parents are central
like why is it logical that your parents

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
like why is it logical that your parents
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.429
like why is it logical that your parents
make opinion makes any more difference

00:02:39.429 --> 00:02:39.439
make opinion makes any more difference
 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.119
make opinion makes any more difference
to you than the appearance than the the

00:02:43.119 --> 00:02:43.129
to you than the appearance than the the
 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.970
to you than the appearance than the the
opinion of some randomly selected people

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980
opinion of some randomly selected people
 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.729
opinion of some randomly selected people
who are approximately that age why is it

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739
who are approximately that age why is it
 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.080
who are approximately that age why is it
the case that you would consider that

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090
the case that you would consider that
 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.879
the case that you would consider that
they would know more than someone else I

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:51.889
they would know more than someone else I
 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.289
they would know more than someone else I
mean I know they know you better and

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:53.299
mean I know they know you better and
 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:55.360
mean I know they know you better and
fair enough but that that's not the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370
fair enough but that that's not the
 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.869
fair enough but that that's not the
point

00:02:55.869 --> 00:02:55.879
point
 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.020
point
and then another point there is that to

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030
and then another point there is that to
 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.849
and then another point there is that to
the degree that your parents opinion

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:00.859
the degree that your parents opinion
 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:02.649
the degree that your parents opinion
about you matters more than some

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:02.659
about you matters more than some
 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:04.209
about you matters more than some
randomly selected people of

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:04.219
randomly selected people of
 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.819
randomly selected people of
approximately the same age you would say

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829
approximately the same age you would say
 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.339
approximately the same age you would say
well you haven't exactly separated out

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349
well you haven't exactly separated out
 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.159
well you haven't exactly separated out
the gaudy image from your parents and so

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:12.169
the gaudy image from your parents and so
 

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:14.349
the gaudy image from your parents and so
you're still under that that combination

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359
you're still under that that combination
 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:17.319
you're still under that that combination
it's like it's a complicated thing to

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329
it's like it's a complicated thing to
 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.629
it's like it's a complicated thing to
talk about but think about the Harry

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:19.639
talk about but think about the Harry
 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.420
talk about but think about the Harry
Potter series Harry has two sets of

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430
Potter series Harry has two sets of
 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.890
Potter series Harry has two sets of
parents right he's got the Dursley

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900
parents right he's got the Dursley
 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.750
parents right he's got the Dursley
parents and then he's got these like

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
parents and then he's got these like
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.429
parents and then he's got these like
magical parents that sort of float

00:03:27.429 --> 00:03:27.439
magical parents that sort of float
 

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:29.439
magical parents that sort of float
behind and he should know the difference

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:29.449
behind and he should know the difference
 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.240
behind and he should know the difference
between them they shouldn't be one in

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250
between them they shouldn't be one in
 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.849
between them they shouldn't be one in
the same they're not for him and it's

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:33.859
the same they're not for him and it's
 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.740
the same they're not for him and it's
like well you have your parents and you

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750
like well you have your parents and you
 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.629
like well you have your parents and you
have nature and culture as parents and

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639
have nature and culture as parents and
 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:38.800
have nature and culture as parents and
you shouldn't be thinking that your

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810
you shouldn't be thinking that your
 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.479
you shouldn't be thinking that your
parents are nature and culture as well

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489
parents are nature and culture as well
 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.640
parents are nature and culture as well
you shouldn't have final dominion over

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650
you shouldn't have final dominion over
 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.830
you shouldn't have final dominion over
you means that you're not an individual

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840
you means that you're not an individual
 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.050
you means that you're not an individual
yet if that's the case Freud said for

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060
yet if that's the case Freud said for
 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.860
yet if that's the case Freud said for
example that no no no one could be a man

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
example that no no no one could be a man
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.469
example that no no no one could be a man
unless his father had died and Jung said

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:53.479
unless his father had died and Jung said
 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:55.059
unless his father had died and Jung said
yes but that death can take place

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
yes but that death can take place
 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.849
yes but that death can take place
symbolically okay so there's that part

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859
symbolically okay so there's that part
 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:59.649
symbolically okay so there's that part
of the idea and then another part of the

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659
of the idea and then another part of the
 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.849
of the idea and then another part of the
idea is one of the times in your life

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859
idea is one of the times in your life
 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.710
idea is one of the times in your life
when you actually realize that you're an

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720
when you actually realize that you're an
 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.839
when you actually realize that you're an
individual is when you'll go and ask

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849
individual is when you'll go and ask
 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.429
individual is when you'll go and ask
your parents something and you realize

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:09.439
your parents something and you realize
 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:11.819
your parents something and you realize
they actually don't know any more about

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829
they actually don't know any more about
 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.009
they actually don't know any more about
what you should do then you do and that

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019
what you should do then you do and that
 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.680
what you should do then you do and that
sucks and that's partly why people are

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690
sucks and that's partly why people are
 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.990
sucks and that's partly why people are
often willing to maintain a tyrant slave

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000
often willing to maintain a tyrant slave
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.729
often willing to maintain a tyrant slave
relationship with their father it's like

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739
relationship with their father it's like
 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.670
relationship with their father it's like
on the one hand you have to be inferior

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680
on the one hand you have to be inferior
 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.750
on the one hand you have to be inferior
in a relationship

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760
in a relationship
 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.460
in a relationship
like that you know you've always got the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470
like that you know you've always got the
 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.770
like that you know you've always got the
judge watching you but another hand

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780
judge watching you but another hand
 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.330
judge watching you but another hand
there's always someone who knows what to

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340
there's always someone who knows what to
 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.550
there's always someone who knows what to
do there's always someone standing

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560
do there's always someone standing
 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.680
do there's always someone standing
between you and the unknown that you can

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:35.690
between you and the unknown that you can
 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:37.900
between you and the unknown that you can
go ask what should I do well at some

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910
go ask what should I do well at some
 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:39.550
go ask what should I do well at some
point you'll realize that the reason you

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560
point you'll realize that the reason you
 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.470
point you'll realize that the reason you
can't ask that anymore is because they

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480
can't ask that anymore is because they
 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.090
can't ask that anymore is because they
actually don't know any more than you do

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100
actually don't know any more than you do
 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.030
actually don't know any more than you do
and then that's a pain like that that is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040
and then that's a pain like that that is
 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.940
and then that's a pain like that that is
a symbolic death that's also when you

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950
a symbolic death that's also when you
 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.250
a symbolic death that's also when you
establish a more individual relationship

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260
establish a more individual relationship
 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:52.840
establish a more individual relationship
with your parents it's at that point

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:52.850
with your parents it's at that point
 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:54.760
with your parents it's at that point
that you could conceivably start taking

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770
that you could conceivably start taking
 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.650
that you could conceivably start taking
care of them instead of the reverse and

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660
care of them instead of the reverse and
 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.140
care of them instead of the reverse and
that's the time that should come but you

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150
that's the time that should come but you
 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.270
that's the time that should come but you
have to let that image of perfection go

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280
have to let that image of perfection go
 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.240
have to let that image of perfection go
and that exposes you well that's what

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250
and that exposes you well that's what
 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.080
and that exposes you well that's what
happens here

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090
happens here
 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.720
happens here
you know Pinocchio goes home and he

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730
you know Pinocchio goes home and he
 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.090
you know Pinocchio goes home and he
wants things to be the way they were and

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100
wants things to be the way they were and
 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.760
wants things to be the way they were and
he wants to stay under the careful care

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770
he wants to stay under the careful care
 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.000
he wants to stay under the careful care
of the benevolent father but that's no

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010
of the benevolent father but that's no
 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.980
of the benevolent father but that's no
longer possible he's past that point and

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990
longer possible he's past that point and
 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:20.200
longer possible he's past that point and
that's why the father has disappeared

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210
that's why the father has disappeared
 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.470
that's why the father has disappeared
and so Geppetto has gone off to look for

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:23.480
and so Geppetto has gone off to look for
 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.630
and so Geppetto has gone off to look for
Pinocchio because he also needs a son

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640
Pinocchio because he also needs a son
 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.380
Pinocchio because he also needs a son
but but in any case the house is

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390
but but in any case the house is
 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.980
but but in any case the house is
abandoned and so then there we see

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
abandoned and so then there we see
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.810
abandoned and so then there we see
inside the house that everything's

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820
inside the house that everything's
 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.430
inside the house that everything's
covered with cobwebs and everything's

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440
covered with cobwebs and everything's
 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.230
covered with cobwebs and everything's
gone and Pinocchio and the crickets sit

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240
gone and Pinocchio and the crickets sit
 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.430
gone and Pinocchio and the crickets sit
on the steps and they're very concerned

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440
on the steps and they're very concerned
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.590
on the steps and they're very concerned
first of all they wonder where he went

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:41.600
first of all they wonder where he went
 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.180
first of all they wonder where he went
so they're actually concerned that he's

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190
so they're actually concerned that he's
 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:45.130
so they're actually concerned that he's
gone but they also don't know what to do

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:45.140
gone but they also don't know what to do
 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.050
gone but they also don't know what to do
because there's just no going home and

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060
because there's just no going home and
 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.540
because there's just no going home and
so you know that's also the case that

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
so you know that's also the case that
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.060
so you know that's also the case that
once you hit a certain point in your

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070
once you hit a certain point in your
 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.700
once you hit a certain point in your
development well it's the same thing we

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710
development well it's the same thing we
 

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.770
development well it's the same thing we
already talked about the answers that

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780
already talked about the answers that
 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:58.240
already talked about the answers that
you're looking for are not going to be

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250
you're looking for are not going to be
 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:00.220
you're looking for are not going to be
found in your parents house it's as

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:00.230
found in your parents house it's as
 

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:01.270
found in your parents house it's as
simple as that now you could

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280
simple as that now you could
 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.240
simple as that now you could
artificially maintain your dependency

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:04.250
artificially maintain your dependency
 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.150
artificially maintain your dependency
but you know if you do that for too long

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160
but you know if you do that for too long
 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.210
but you know if you do that for too long
things get pretty ugly so you get pretty

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:10.220
things get pretty ugly so you get pretty
 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.760
things get pretty ugly so you get pretty
stale and and you know you're like bread

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770
stale and and you know you're like bread
 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.270
stale and and you know you're like bread
that's been on the Shelf for too long
