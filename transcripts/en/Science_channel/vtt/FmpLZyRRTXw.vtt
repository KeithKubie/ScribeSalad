THREE, TWO, ONE.

00:00:07.834 --> 00:00:08.901
YEAH!

00:00:08.901 --> 00:00:11.200
Jesse:
THIS ISN'T SOUNDING GOOD.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.300
[ LAUGHS ]

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.167
OH!

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:16.901
WHOA,
IT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

00:00:16.901 --> 00:00:19.434
Rachel: THIS IS AWESOME.

00:00:19.434 --> 00:00:20.667
OH, YEAH!

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.200
I'M AMAZED AT HOW
MUCH CONTROL I HAVE.

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:26.968
WE WERE ALMOST DRIFTING.

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:29.033
YES!

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.934
OUR TAPE IS ON FIRE!

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:32.701
YES!

00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:34.000
OKAY,
HERE COMES THE DRIFT.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.267
OH, GOD.

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:36.968
SO I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOODNESS.

00:00:36.968 --> 00:00:39.133
I HOPE WE DON'T CRASH."

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:42.601
WHOA!

00:00:42.601 --> 00:00:43.801
WE NEARLY
TOOK THE CONE OUT.

00:00:43.801 --> 00:00:45.067
THERE WE GO.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:46.901
WHEN I WAS DRIVING,
THE RIDE WAS A LITTLE BUMPY,

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:49.067
BUT THE TIRES HELD UP
PRETTY WELL.

00:00:49.067 --> 00:00:51.367
WOW, I CAN SEE THINGS
FLYING ALL THE WAY OFF OF US.

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.434
-WHOA!
-I SMELL DUCT TAPE.

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.200
AS FAR AS ADAM DRIVING,

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.067
THOSE ARE DEFINITELY
EXTREME CONDITIONS.

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:06.367
[ ALL SHOUTING ]

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:08.167
YEAH!

00:01:08.167 --> 00:01:10.200
WHOO!

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.267
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:01:12.267 --> 00:01:14.601
COME ON! COME ON,
WE CAN MAKE IT. YES!

00:01:14.601 --> 00:01:17.167
YEAH!

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:19.634
Cannan: YEAH!

00:01:19.634 --> 00:01:21.901
WHOA!

00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:24.334
I THINK WE HAVE
SOME PROBLEMS.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:27.567
HOUSTON.
-HOUSTON, WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.601
I THINK I COULD FEEL
SOME SPECIFIC ISSUES.

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:33.834
Narrator: AND THAT IS WHY
WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS.

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.100
DUDES, GIVE ME SOME!

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.267
THAT WAS SO MUCH FUN!

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.968
DESPITE ADAM'S INEVITABLE NEED

00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:44.267
TO PUSH THE DUCT TAPE
TIRES BEYOND EVEN THEIR

00:01:44.267 --> 00:01:48.767
PRODIGIOUS CAPABILITIES,
THE RESULT'S CLEAR CUT.

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:53.167
AFTER ADAM'S RIDE,
THE TIRES WERE TRASH.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:56.234
BUT IF I GOT A FLAT,
AND I HAD A WHOLE BUNCH OF ROLLS

00:01:56.234 --> 00:01:58.334
OF DUCT TAPE IN MY TRUNK,
AND A LOT OF TIME,

00:01:58.334 --> 00:02:00.734
I THINK I COULD
DEFINITELY MAKE A TIRE.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.400
Jesse:
ADAM, THIS TIRE IS GONE.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.300
-REALLY?
-ABSOLUTELY GONE.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.501
[ LAUGHS ]

00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:10.534
-THAT'S WHAT WE WERE FEELING.
-YOU DESTROYED THESE THINGS.

00:02:10.534 --> 00:02:12.200
I DID.
LOOK AT THE ONE OVER HERE.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.601
THIS WAS ONE'S ALSO
SEEN BETTER DAYS,

00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:15.267
INCLUDING THIS MORNING.

00:02:15.267 --> 00:02:17.734
OVERALL, I'M REALLY
SURPRISED HOW GOOD

00:02:17.734 --> 00:02:20.234
THESE DUCT TAPE TIRES
ACTUALLY HELD UP.

00:02:21.434 --> 00:02:24.634
Adam: COME ON, COME ON.
WE CAN MAKE IT, YES!

00:02:24.634 --> 00:02:27.467
IN THE GREAT DUCT TAPE
MYTHBUSTERS TRADITION,

00:02:27.467 --> 00:02:29.200
CAN YOU BUILD A DUCT TAPE TIRE?

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.100
THERE'S NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND THAT YOU CAN.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.834
IS CANNAN A BETTER
DRIVER THAN ADAM?

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:35.267
THAT'S PLAUSIBLE.

00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:37.968
[ LAUGHTER ]

00:02:37.968 --> 00:02:39.467
SO SHOULD WE CALL IT
THE MYTH,

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:43.100
THAT DUCT TAPE CAN MAKE
A VIABLE TIRE IN A PINCH?

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.667
-YEP.
-YES.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:45.834
I FEEL LIKE
IT'S TOTALLY CONFIRMED.

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:47.033
-CONFIRMED.
-ABSOLUTELY.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.300
CONFIRMED!
