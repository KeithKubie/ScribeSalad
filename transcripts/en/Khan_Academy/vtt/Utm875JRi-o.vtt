00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:02.229
- [Voiceover] So we have
three different shapes.

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:06.351
We have stars, we have
squares and we have triangles.

00:00:06.351 --> 00:00:08.409
Now we have a different
number of each shape.

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:12.039
So we have five stars,
we have three squares

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.769
and we have six triangles.

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:14.860
You don't see them all here.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.095
This is just telling us how many

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:18.157
of each of these shapes that we have.

00:00:18.157 --> 00:00:21.976
So we have five stars, three
squares and six triangles,

00:00:21.976 --> 00:00:25.211
how many total shapes do we have?

00:00:25.211 --> 00:00:26.539
Well, you're probably saying,

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:28.373
maybe I should add these numbers,

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:30.787
because I'm trying to find
the total number of shapes.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:33.771
And if you said that I
would say you are right.

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.536
So let's add those numbers.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:39.210
So we want to add five

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.210
plus three plus six.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:47.200
So what is this going to be?

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.394
Well what's five plus three,

00:00:49.394 --> 00:00:51.913
five triangles plus three squares.

00:00:51.913 --> 00:00:55.152
Well five plus three is eight,

00:00:55.152 --> 00:00:56.800
so this is going to be eight

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.890
and then we still have to add six.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.175
So we're still going to add six.

00:01:02.175 --> 00:01:04.277
Now what's eight plus six?

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:06.192
Well you may or may not know this,

00:01:06.192 --> 00:01:07.051
and if you don't this,

00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.779
well you could count
things out if you like,

00:01:09.779 --> 00:01:11.196
but it is a good thing to know

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:12.612
just off of the top of your head.

00:01:12.612 --> 00:01:14.017
So if you don't know it yet,

00:01:14.017 --> 00:01:16.455
put this in your brain.

00:01:16.455 --> 00:01:19.612
Eight plus six is 14.

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:23.315
Eight plus six is equal to 14.

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:28.156
So five plus three plus
six is also equal to 14.

00:01:28.156 --> 00:01:30.397
Now one question you might have is,

00:01:30.397 --> 00:01:34.089
well does it matter the
order that I do this in?

00:01:34.089 --> 00:01:35.958
Well let's try it the other way around.

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:37.327
Let's try it again.

00:01:37.327 --> 00:01:42.327
Let's try five plus three

00:01:44.847 --> 00:01:48.300
plus six.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.413
Instead of adding the
five and the three first,

00:01:50.413 --> 00:01:52.758
let's add the three and the six first.

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:55.393
So what is three plus six?

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:57.936
Well that's going to be nine.

00:01:57.936 --> 00:02:00.676
Then we're going to have five plus nine.

00:02:00.676 --> 00:02:03.450
Five plus nine.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.095
Well, once again, if you know
that, you'll know it's 14,

00:02:07.095 --> 00:02:08.779
If you don't know that,
that's another good thing

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.228
to put in your brain and just to know.

00:02:11.228 --> 00:02:14.177
Five plus nine is equal to 14.

00:02:14.177 --> 00:02:15.013
If you don't know that,

00:02:15.013 --> 00:02:16.348
and you don't believe me

00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:18.368
take some pebbles out and five pebbles

00:02:18.368 --> 00:02:19.888
and then nine more, and you'll see

00:02:19.888 --> 00:02:21.595
that when you add them
together, you get to 14.

00:02:21.595 --> 00:02:24.648
But this is just a good thing
for you to know in your brain.

00:02:24.648 --> 00:02:26.111
And you could have done
it the other way around.

00:02:26.111 --> 00:02:28.189
You could have added five and six first,

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.950
you get 11 plus three
would have also been 14.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.849
Either way, you have 14 total shapes.
