00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.096
- [Instructor] In several
videos, we have touched

00:00:02.096 --> 00:00:04.716
on the idea of separation of powers

00:00:04.716 --> 00:00:08.099
between three branches of
government in the United States.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.573
You have the legislative
branch that writes laws

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:14.293
and decides on the budget
for the government.

00:00:14.293 --> 00:00:15.778
You have the executive branch

00:00:15.778 --> 00:00:17.891
that runs the actual government.

00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:19.386
And then you have the judicial branch

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.341
that decides on the
constitutionality of laws

00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.079
and actions by the government

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.034
as well as interprets existing laws.

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:30.549
And connected to this idea
of separation of powers

00:00:30.549 --> 00:00:33.446
where each of these branches
are somewhat independent

00:00:33.446 --> 00:00:34.970
but not completely independent,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.399
is that they all have checks
and balances on each other.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:42.081
We've talked about in multiple videos,

00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:44.913
the executive can veto a
law by the legislative,

00:00:44.913 --> 00:00:47.263
the legislative can override that veto,

00:00:47.263 --> 00:00:49.079
the legislative decides on the budget

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.374
that the executive has
to run the government,

00:00:51.374 --> 00:00:53.662
the judicial branch decides
on constitutionality,

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:56.738
the executive branch decides
who is even going to become

00:00:56.738 --> 00:00:58.861
a justice in the Supreme Court.

00:00:58.861 --> 00:01:01.197
And so when you have
this separation of powers

00:01:01.197 --> 00:01:02.987
and you have this checks and balances,

00:01:02.987 --> 00:01:05.385
it provides multiple opportunities

00:01:05.385 --> 00:01:09.552
to influence policy and
the actions of government.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.460
And there's two ways that
you could view influence.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.247
You could view it as a positive thing,

00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:17.778
after all, it's government by the people,

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:19.912
the people are sovereign
so they should be able

00:01:19.912 --> 00:01:22.257
to influence what the government does.

00:01:22.257 --> 00:01:24.654
But sometimes, a cynical view of influence

00:01:24.654 --> 00:01:26.197
is well, who gets to influence?

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:30.221
And is it really by the people
or are there other interests,

00:01:30.221 --> 00:01:34.526
maybe driven by things like
money that have undue influence?

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:37.463
But just to get sense of
how folks can influence

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.434
or where there are points of influence is,

00:01:39.434 --> 00:01:42.184
well first, what laws get passed?

00:01:43.976 --> 00:01:45.912
or what gets funded?

00:01:45.912 --> 00:01:48.466
That's decided in the budget.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:50.466
Now, as an individual, as a citizen

00:01:50.466 --> 00:01:53.778
you can write letters
to your congress person,

00:01:53.778 --> 00:01:56.126
you can petition them,
you can call them up,

00:01:56.126 --> 00:01:59.688
you can show up at a
town hall that they hold

00:01:59.688 --> 00:02:01.834
in order to speak your voice.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:04.401
But there's also interest groups.

00:02:04.401 --> 00:02:06.741
Now interest groups could be
corporate interest groups,

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:11.100
they could be unions,
they could be professions,

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.213
and these interest groups will often times

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:16.856
also lobby congress in order to influence

00:02:16.856 --> 00:02:18.687
what gets funded or the laws

00:02:18.687 --> 00:02:21.227
that get passed or don't get passed.

00:02:21.227 --> 00:02:24.408
And the word lobbying
really is just this idea

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:27.517
of trying to influence the government.

00:02:27.517 --> 00:02:31.032
Now a major way, a
major point of influence

00:02:31.032 --> 00:02:35.104
in the United States is
when there are elections.

00:02:35.104 --> 00:02:37.826
Who actually gets elected.

00:02:37.826 --> 00:02:40.538
And so you can imagine, there
could be direct support,

00:02:40.538 --> 00:02:42.570
endorsement for different candidates,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.470
money, especially with mass media,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.360
becoming more and more important,

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.195
becomes a bigger and
bigger part of elections.

00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:51.642
So you can donate at an individual level

00:02:51.642 --> 00:02:55.320
or you often see now, and this
is a very controversial area

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.880
where there's heated
debates on to what degree

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.094
large donations can be made,

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:03.223
to what degree corporations
can influence elections,

00:03:03.223 --> 00:03:05.255
but who gets elected is perhaps

00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:09.014
the biggest lever on our government.

00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:12.498
For example, even if your
main concern is judicial

00:03:12.498 --> 00:03:14.470
and the judicial is the one branch

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:16.408
that is most immune from elections,

00:03:16.408 --> 00:03:18.473
Supreme Court justices are not elected,

00:03:18.473 --> 00:03:20.005
they are appointed by the president

00:03:20.005 --> 00:03:22.118
with approval from the senate.

00:03:22.118 --> 00:03:25.381
But if you did care who is
going to be in the judiciary,

00:03:25.381 --> 00:03:27.473
well there, there would
be a strong motivation

00:03:27.473 --> 00:03:30.013
to influence who is going to be president

00:03:30.013 --> 00:03:31.789
and then even once they are president,

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:34.289
there might be some
influence, some lobbying,

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:37.124
on who they appoint to the judiciary.

00:03:37.124 --> 00:03:39.266
If a law gets passed by congress,

00:03:39.266 --> 00:03:40.626
there's still another outlet.

00:03:40.626 --> 00:03:44.537
You could petition the
executive to veto that law.

00:03:44.537 --> 00:03:46.044
So I'll leave you there.

00:03:46.044 --> 00:03:48.084
The main takeaway from this is

00:03:48.084 --> 00:03:49.791
that because of these checks and balances

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:52.522
and separation of powers,
there's multiple levers

00:03:52.522 --> 00:03:54.321
of influence in the government

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:56.128
and I've just touched on a few on them.

00:03:56.128 --> 00:03:58.465
An interesting thing to
always think about is

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:02.164
how much of our current
levers of influence,

00:04:02.164 --> 00:04:05.697
especially as they exist today
in our modern government,

00:04:05.697 --> 00:04:08.169
how much of this was
intended by the founders

00:04:08.169 --> 00:04:11.265
of our country, the authors
of the Constitution,

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:13.072
and how much is based on things

00:04:13.072 --> 00:04:14.761
that we could have never predicted?

00:04:14.761 --> 00:04:16.711
They could've never predicted
the size of the country?

00:04:16.711 --> 00:04:20.113
They could've never predicted
the influence of mass media?

00:04:20.113 --> 00:04:21.953
They could've never perhaps predicted

00:04:21.953 --> 00:04:23.393
the influence of money?

00:04:23.393 --> 00:04:24.638
Who knows.

00:04:24.638 --> 00:04:27.304
I will leave you with that question.
