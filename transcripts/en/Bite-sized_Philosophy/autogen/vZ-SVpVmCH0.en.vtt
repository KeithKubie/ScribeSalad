00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.379
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of
 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.120
I'm unwilling to deny the existence of
free choice merely because I don't

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130
free choice merely because I don't
 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.639
free choice merely because I don't
understand it because it looks to me

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649
understand it because it looks to me
 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.339
understand it because it looks to me
like that's how people act that's how

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349
like that's how people act that's how
 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.709
like that's how people act that's how
they expect to be treated and that

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:11.719
they expect to be treated and that
 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.539
they expect to be treated and that
societies who that could structure

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
societies who that could structure
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.369
societies who that could structure
themselves in accordance with the idea

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379
themselves in accordance with the idea
 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230
themselves in accordance with the idea
that people have free choice actually

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240
that people have free choice actually
 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.070
that people have free choice actually
work

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
work
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.960
work
now that doesn't prove that there's free

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970
now that doesn't prove that there's free
 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.220
now that doesn't prove that there's free
choice but people have been arguing

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
choice but people have been arguing
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.279
choice but people have been arguing
about that forever so but it looks to me

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
about that forever so but it looks to me
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.349
about that forever so but it looks to me
so those are two possible means of

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359
so those are two possible means of
 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060
so those are two possible means of
integration and then I think what you're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070
integration and then I think what you're
 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.150
integration and then I think what you're
doing is feeding one or the other

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160
doing is feeding one or the other
 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.790
doing is feeding one or the other
constantly and I think you probably

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800
constantly and I think you probably
 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.270
constantly and I think you probably
choose which one to feed I think that's

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280
choose which one to feed I think that's
 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.340
choose which one to feed I think that's
and I mean that's how it feels that way

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350
and I mean that's how it feels that way
 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.100
and I mean that's how it feels that way
to me as well like when I look at my own

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:42.110
to me as well like when I look at my own
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.510
to me as well like when I look at my own
you know

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520
you know
 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.369
you know
maybe you're really aggravated with

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379
maybe you're really aggravated with
 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.020
maybe you're really aggravated with
something maybe you're aggravated with

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
something maybe you're aggravated with
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.170
something maybe you're aggravated with
your wife you know or your child or

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180
your wife you know or your child or
 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.479
your wife you know or your child or
something like that you know and you're

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489
something like that you know and you're
 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299
something like that you know and you're
feeling kind of nasty and maybe even

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309
feeling kind of nasty and maybe even
 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.770
feeling kind of nasty and maybe even
know that you're in the wrong and an

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
know that you're in the wrong and an
 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.540
know that you're in the wrong and an
idea comes into your head you think I

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550
idea comes into your head you think I
 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.330
idea comes into your head you think I
could say that and you know you could

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340
could say that and you know you could
 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.609
could say that and you know you could
say it and you know what it would do but

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619
say it and you know what it would do but
 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.330
say it and you know what it would do but
then you pause and you think would that

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340
then you pause and you think would that
 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.830
then you pause and you think would that
make it better or worse and then maybe

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
make it better or worse and then maybe
 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.170
make it better or worse and then maybe
you go to hell with it which is a quite

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180
you go to hell with it which is a quite
 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.700
you go to hell with it which is a quite
the thing to say I've got a little story

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
the thing to say I've got a little story
 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.580
the thing to say I've got a little story
about that in a minute and then you say

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590
about that in a minute and then you say
 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.510
about that in a minute and then you say
it but you knew you knew that you took

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520
it but you knew you knew that you took
 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.149
it but you knew you knew that you took
the low road right and you know it and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159
the low road right and you know it and
 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.469
the low road right and you know it and
then you're guilty about that and

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479
then you're guilty about that and
 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.999
then you're guilty about that and
defensive and that makes the fight way

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009
defensive and that makes the fight way
 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.560
defensive and that makes the fight way
worse because then there's no damn way

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570
worse because then there's no damn way
 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.630
worse because then there's no damn way
you're gonna admit that you actually did

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
you're gonna admit that you actually did
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.690
you're gonna admit that you actually did
that and so things do go to hell and so

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700
that and so things do go to hell and so
 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.080
that and so things do go to hell and so
so here's here's an ugly little idea so

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090
so here's here's an ugly little idea so
 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.200
so here's here's an ugly little idea so
that's that's that's relevant to the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
that's that's that's relevant to the
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.140
that's that's that's relevant to the
question so imagine you're playing

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150
question so imagine you're playing
 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.560
question so imagine you're playing
around with cocaine now I'm using

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
around with cocaine now I'm using
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.690
around with cocaine now I'm using
cocaine because it's very addictive but

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700
cocaine because it's very addictive but
 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.490
cocaine because it's very addictive but
it's a very interesting chemical because

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
it's a very interesting chemical because
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.370
it's a very interesting chemical because
it's a dopaminergic agonist and what

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380
it's a dopaminergic agonist and what
 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.770
it's a dopaminergic agonist and what
what dopamine does is two things it

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
what dopamine does is two things it
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.420
what dopamine does is two things it
makes you feel like what you're doing is

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430
makes you feel like what you're doing is
 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.420
makes you feel like what you're doing is
worthwhile but it also imagine that

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430
worthwhile but it also imagine that
 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.160
worthwhile but it also imagine that
there's a bunch of neural circuits that

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
there's a bunch of neural circuits that
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.319
there's a bunch of neural circuits that
are active and then they get a hit of

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329
are active and then they get a hit of
 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.929
are active and then they get a hit of
dopamine or you do then those neural

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939
dopamine or you do then those neural
 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.869
dopamine or you do then those neural
circuits get a little bit more powerful

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:07.879
circuits get a little bit more powerful
 

00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:11.630
circuits get a little bit more powerful
okay so it it has a rewarding property

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640
okay so it it has a rewarding property
 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.860
okay so it it has a rewarding property
which is that it makes you feel like

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870
which is that it makes you feel like
 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.450
which is that it makes you feel like
what

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460
what
 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.640
what
doing is important and it has a

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650
doing is important and it has a
 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.650
doing is important and it has a
reinforcing property which is it makes

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660
reinforcing property which is it makes
 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.130
reinforcing property which is it makes
neural circuits grow so now what that

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140
neural circuits grow so now what that
 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.550
neural circuits grow so now what that
means is that whatever you were doing

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560
means is that whatever you were doing
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.930
means is that whatever you were doing
just before you took cocaine grows okay

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940
just before you took cocaine grows okay
 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.520
just before you took cocaine grows okay
so now imagine there's a bunch of

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530
so now imagine there's a bunch of
 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.200
so now imagine there's a bunch of
different things that you do just before

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210
different things that you do just before
 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.870
different things that you do just before
you take cocaine but there's a string of

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880
you take cocaine but there's a string of
 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.930
you take cocaine but there's a string of
decisions and at one decision point is

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940
decisions and at one decision point is
 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.670
decisions and at one decision point is
the same for all of those difference

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680
the same for all of those difference
 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.620
the same for all of those difference
occurrences and that decision point is

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630
occurrences and that decision point is
 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.330
occurrences and that decision point is
because you know you're in trouble and

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340
because you know you're in trouble and
 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.580
because you know you're in trouble and
that decision point is well to hell with

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590
that decision point is well to hell with
 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.050
that decision point is well to hell with
it okay so then you think that each of

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060
it okay so then you think that each of
 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.120
it okay so then you think that each of
the two hundred times that you take

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130
the two hundred times that you take
 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.320
the two hundred times that you take
cocaine even though you do it in

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330
cocaine even though you do it in
 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.900
cocaine even though you do it in
different places but that one thought is

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910
different places but that one thought is
 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.030
different places but that one thought is
there all the time and that thing grows

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040
there all the time and that thing grows
 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.310
there all the time and that thing grows
because you're reinforcing it and it

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320
because you're reinforcing it and it
 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.560
because you're reinforcing it and it
grows and it grows and it grows and so

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570
grows and it grows and it grows and so
 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.420
grows and it grows and it grows and so
now that's in you that's that's part of

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430
now that's in you that's that's part of
 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.820
now that's in you that's that's part of
you and it's the thing that says to hell

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830
you and it's the thing that says to hell
 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:10.840
you and it's the thing that says to hell
with it okay so now and maybe that's not

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850
with it okay so now and maybe that's not
 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.520
with it okay so now and maybe that's not
such a good thing to grow inside your

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530
such a good thing to grow inside your
 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.820
such a good thing to grow inside your
brain so then you you're addicted and

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830
brain so then you you're addicted and
 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.290
brain so then you you're addicted and
they take you to a cocaine treatment

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300
they take you to a cocaine treatment
 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.330
they take you to a cocaine treatment
center and after a week you're no longer

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340
center and after a week you're no longer
 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:21.640
center and after a week you're no longer
physically physiologically addicted

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650
physically physiologically addicted
 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:23.650
physically physiologically addicted
you're not craving you don't have a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660
you're not craving you don't have a
 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.650
you're not craving you don't have a
problem as long as you're there but then

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:26.660
problem as long as you're there but then
 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.030
problem as long as you're there but then
they take you back to your normal

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040
they take you back to your normal
 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.730
they take you back to your normal
environment and you see like cocaine Joe

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740
environment and you see like cocaine Joe
 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.970
environment and you see like cocaine Joe
your friend and as soon as you see him

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
your friend and as soon as you see him
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.190
your friend and as soon as you see him
up that thing comes and bang you're back

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200
up that thing comes and bang you're back
 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.670
up that thing comes and bang you're back
on the you're back on the to hell with

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680
on the you're back on the to hell with
 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.770
on the you're back on the to hell with
the track and that's well you're in well

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780
the track and that's well you're in well
 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.640
the track and that's well you're in well
you're where you will end up too if you

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650
you're where you will end up too if you
 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.930
you're where you will end up too if you
reinforce that particular perspective

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940
reinforce that particular perspective
 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.740
reinforce that particular perspective
long enough so that's akin in a sense to

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750
long enough so that's akin in a sense to
 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.540
long enough so that's akin in a sense to
the this decision-making process you

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550
the this decision-making process you
 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:54.900
the this decision-making process you
know if you if you take the low road

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910
know if you if you take the low road
 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.250
know if you if you take the low road
then that wins and it gets a little

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260
then that wins and it gets a little
 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.590
then that wins and it gets a little
stronger because everything that wins

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600
stronger because everything that wins
 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.520
stronger because everything that wins
neurologically gets a little stronger

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530
neurologically gets a little stronger
 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.760
neurologically gets a little stronger
it's like a Darwinian competition so one

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770
it's like a Darwinian competition so one
 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.650
it's like a Darwinian competition so one
rule is don't practice what you don't

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660
rule is don't practice what you don't
 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.600
rule is don't practice what you don't
want to become because you really do

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:10.610
want to become because you really do
 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.090
want to become because you really do
become that it builds it builds itself

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100
become that it builds it builds itself
 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.190
become that it builds it builds itself
right into your neural architecture and

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200
right into your neural architecture and
 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:16.870
right into your neural architecture and
that's one of the terrifying things

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880
that's one of the terrifying things
 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:18.039
that's one of the terrifying things
about addiction you know because you

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:18.049
about addiction you know because you
 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.720
about addiction you know because you
think well it's kind of psychological

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730
think well it's kind of psychological
 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.450
think well it's kind of psychological
it's like yeah kind of it's also kind of

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460
it's like yeah kind of it's also kind of
 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:24.130
it's like yeah kind of it's also kind of
neuro physiological and you build a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140
neuro physiological and you build a
 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.750
neuro physiological and you build a
one-eyed cocaine monster in your

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760
one-eyed cocaine monster in your
 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.790
one-eyed cocaine monster in your
and if you hit yourself enough with

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800
and if you hit yourself enough with
 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.870
and if you hit yourself enough with
something that reinforcing so yeah
