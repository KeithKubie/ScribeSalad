TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello,
I'm Timothy Jordan

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:03.757
for The Developer Show.

00:00:03.757 --> 00:00:06.090
And this is your update about
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.550
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.730
Nvidia TensorRT is a library
that optimizes deep learning

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.730
models for inference and
creates a runtime for deployment

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.980
on GPUs in production
environments.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.630
TensorRT and TensorFlow are
integrated with TensorFlow 1.7.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.120
In our tests, we found
that ResNet-50 performed

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.610
eight times faster,
under seven milliseconds

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:29.850
latency, with the
TensorFlow-TensorRT integration

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.030
using Nvidia Volta
tensor cores, as compared

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.740
with running TensorFlow only.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.770
For graphs and code,
check out the post.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.620
Android Studio 3.1 is
now available to download

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.180
in the stable release channel.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.040
The focus areas for
this release are

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.180
around product quality and
app development productivity.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.460
In addition to many
underlying quality changes,

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.920
we added several new features
into Android Studio 3.1 that

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.620
you should take a
look at integrating

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.250
into your development flow,
including a C++ Performance

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.150
Profiler, better code editor
support to aid in your SQL

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.880
table and query
creation statements,

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.550
and better Lint support
for your Kotlin code.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.800
Details and screenshots
are on the post.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.130
The Wear OS developer
preview is now available,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070
bringing Android PE platform
features to wearables.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.140
Included are the
Dark UI system theme,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.350
and restriction related to
non-SDK methods and fields.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.140
Install instructions
are on the post.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.480
Stackdriver Profiler
is now available.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.260
It lets you profile and explore
how your code actually executes

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.720
in production to
optimize performance

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.797
and reduce cost of computation.

00:01:35.797 --> 00:01:37.380
Head on over to the
post to learn more

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.510
about the Stackdriver
application performance

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.910
management toolkit,
including integrations

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:47.410
between Stackdriver Debugger and
GitHub Enterprise and GitLab.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.760
You can use Cloud Text-to-Speech
for high-quality text-to-speech

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.300
synthesis that produces
natural-sounding speech.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.910
It lets you choose from 32
different voices from 12

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.580
languages and variants,
correctly pronounces

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.600
complex texts such as names,
dates, times, and addresses,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.730
and allows you to
customize pitch,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.960
speaking rate, and volume gain.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.710

are on the post.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:12.600
Kubernetes Engine
Private Clusters

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.310
is now available in beta.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.290
With it, you can deploy
clusters privately

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.760
as part of the Google
virtual private cloud.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.510
Your cluster's
nodes can then only

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.180
be accessed from
within the trusted VPC.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.940
Getting started instructions
are on the post.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.930
