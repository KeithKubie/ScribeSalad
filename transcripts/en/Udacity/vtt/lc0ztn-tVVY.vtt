00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.790
This parabola has a vertex at 2,3 right here. Nice work if you got this

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.924
correct. Just like before, we'll take our equation and we'll try to complete

00:00:11.924 --> 00:00:17.702
the square this time for the y terms. The b value here is negative 6, so b over

00:00:17.702 --> 00:00:24.204
2 is negative 3. And b over 2 squared equals 9, the square of this number. So,

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:28.216
we know we need to add 9 in order to make a perfect square here, but I can't

00:00:28.216 --> 00:00:34.409
just add 9 to an equation since I'll change it. So, if I add 9 here I should

00:00:34.409 --> 00:00:40.667
also subtract 9 that will make it balanced, I really added 0. We rewrite this

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:44.798
part as a perfect square. And now we can just combine these two numbers on the

00:00:44.798 --> 00:00:51.365
end. This gives us an equation in vertex form. And notice that it's x equals,

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:56.401
so we know the parabola will open to the left, or to the right. Since there's a

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:59.821
positive 1 in front of our square term, we know that a is 1, so our parabola

00:00:59.821 --> 00:01:05.468
opens to the right. For a horizontal parabola, the x coordinate of the vertex

00:01:05.468 --> 00:01:11.420
is here. It's h. The y coordinate of the vertex is k, and it's here. It's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.698
positive 3. We can find the y value of the vertex by setting y minus 3 equal to

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:24.252
0. So, we know x is positive 2, and y would be positive 3. Now that we have the

00:01:24.252 --> 00:01:27.166
vertex let's figure out how to graph our parabola and know that it opens this

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:32.330
way. The a value is always in front of the squared term. So, a here is still

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.298
positive 1 so let's zoom in our vertex and figure out how to graph those other

00:01:36.298 --> 00:01:43.334
two points. Here is our vertex at 2, 3 and now we go a units in the x

00:01:43.334 --> 00:01:50.776
direction. So, we'll go 1 unit up and one unit down from our vertex. Then we'll

00:01:50.776 --> 00:01:58.160
go 1 unit right and 1 unit right. This gives us our two other points and 3,4

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.207
and 3,2.
