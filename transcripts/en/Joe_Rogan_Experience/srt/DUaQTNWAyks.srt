00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:06,210
Hello sweet bitches of the Internet.
Yeah, that's right. We're back.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,780
This episode is brought
to you by me undies.

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,320
This is a disturbing thing that has been
discovered due to an Internet survey is

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,510
that most men don't change their
underwear. But once every seven years,

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,410
that shit's fucked up. It's more
than that for me. That's fucked up.

6
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:25,210
That's your Dick Hammocks on.
You need to keep that shit clean.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,900
You don't have a pair of underwear that
you know for sure that you've had for a

8
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:29,610
long ass time.
I tried to get rid of them,

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,900
but um, I'm going to be honest with you.
I never bought nice underwear before.

10
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,450
I just would buy like underwear, like
whatever, like a big packet of m and all.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,600
As they kept my Dick in place,

12
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:42,570
I get very upset if the dick hole
opens up and I've got to keep talking,

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,710
talking the hamster back into
the cage. That was bullshit. Um,

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,740
so until these me on these
guys sent me underwear.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,260
These are the best underwear
I've ever worn without a doubt.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:54,060
And I was thinking about it
when I put them on. I was like,

17
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:59,060
why wouldn't I want like comfortable
underwear on my balls and my dick like of

18
00:00:59,061 --> 00:01:03,150
wood. Right. So why haven't I not like
spent money on like some nice underwear.

19
00:01:03,151 --> 00:01:06,480
I've never spent money on nice underwear.
I just bought fucking whatever.

20
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,010
So then of these,
me and these guys,

21
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:11,370
they sent me it and at first I
was like a little bit skeptical.

22
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:13,500
It's like it's fucking underwear
man who this shit about underwear.

23
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:14,730
You gotta to get underwear at a store.

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:18,630
But they have like really high quality
shit. Like it feels good like it,

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
it's like they have moisture like it,
it pulls moisture away from your body.

26
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,550
They're their underwears
like super high end stuff.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,410
You know, I, I, my,

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,800
my Dick is being strangled right now and
I think a ball is hanging out and I've

29
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:35,430
always just accepted like, oh that's
just sitting. That's just your choices.

30
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:37,680
You've got ropes around your
Dick. What are you talking? No,

31
00:01:37,681 --> 00:01:40,710
my underwears way too tight.
Like this underwear that I'm wearing,

32
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,740
I know I've had for a long time
and it's super, super tight.

33
00:01:43,741 --> 00:01:46,590
You have the same underwear for back when
you lost a ton of weight? Yeah. Oh yeah.

34
00:01:46,591 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah.

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,300
I mean I have a hundred word I know I've
had for a long time cause it's kind of

36
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:54,300
like if it's, if it's still
works, why would you throw
it away? It's like a towel.

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:57,660
Well me on disease, your
solutions son. Okay.

38
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,930
And they will pull some moisture away
from your desk and give you some shit that

39
00:02:00,931 --> 00:02:05,820
fit the most comfortable underwear you
have ever tried on. They fit perfectly.

40
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,220
They don't,
they don't strangle you dick safe.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,420
And they literally do pull moisture away
from your skin. So that will help you.

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,750
Like with people that have like
yeasty or things going on it.

43
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,720
Well you should probably clean yourself.
You fucking dirty pig.

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,830
But once you do do that. Yeah, I mean
guys are diabetes just feels better.

45
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,480
Yeah. A lot of guys, you know how
many guys are diabetes? You blow him.

46
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,050
When I got that mail, yeast infection,
I studied it for a long time.

47
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:33,600
I'm sure you did.
I'm sure it wasn't honestly cursory use,

48
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,580
little glimpse on a Google
went back to business it,

49
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,530
where did they pull the moisture to?
They take it to Canada.

50
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:45,300
It's kind of going on them
a lot from Canada. It's just
that's what we give back.

51
00:02:45,301 --> 00:02:49,620
Ball Ball, sweat gutters to this or
like this is your pants just get,

52
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:54,330
become a wet. It just becomes like
the [inaudible] for ball sweat.

53
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:59,620
Just captures it all. Anyway, me on
these.com go there. They're underwear.

54
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,130
I'm

55
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:04,270
wearing them right now. They're very,
very, very comfortable and uh, you know,

56
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,640
change your fucking underwear
more than once every seven years.

57
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:10,950
Your pigs go to [inaudible]

of weeks from now. All right, fuck,

61
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,610
enjoy me undies.
Dot.

62
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:31,130
We are also brought to you by Ting Ting
is the official cell phone provider for

63
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,730
this podcast. The phone is, uh, that
we use for this podcast is run on Ting.

64
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:40,780
Ting is, um, the use of sprint backbone.
And they use it with their own rules,

65
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:45,100
their own rules like that.
They decide, they decided,
okay, let's have no contracts,

66
00:03:45,101 --> 00:03:47,380
et cetera.
No early termination fees.

67
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,210
Let's not even charge people like a
set amount per month. Um, let's do it.

68
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:54,580
They did it two different ways.
One, at one point in time,

69
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:57,610
they would like credit you, they would
knock you down to the lower level.

70
00:03:57,611 --> 00:03:58,870
Like say if you didn't
use all your minutes,

71
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:02,140
they're knocking down to a lower level
and credit either distance the difference

72
00:04:02,141 --> 00:04:05,470
on your next bill. And then he decided
like, that's too fucking complicated.

73
00:04:05,471 --> 00:04:06,820
But you know what it really should be.

74
00:04:06,821 --> 00:04:10,420
It should be people just pay for what
they use. So that's their newest thing,

75
00:04:10,421 --> 00:04:11,980
which I think is perfect.

76
00:04:11,981 --> 00:04:15,400
And I think that's where all cell
phone providers will eventually find

77
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:18,550
themselves. It doesn't make any sense.
It'd be like, you pay for 120 minutes.

78
00:04:18,551 --> 00:04:21,690
We only use a hundred. Where's those
20 minutes? They're gone. They're,

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:26,150
they're evaporated. But with
Tang, 98% of people use tangled,

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,140
saved money. And, uh, again,
they use the sprint backbone,

81
00:04:29,141 --> 00:04:33,760
they rent time on sprints or it's a major
network and they do it in like a very

82
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:35,240
ethical way, in a way that, uh,

83
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:38,080
just makes you feel good about
working with the company.

84
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,880
I think that's how it should be.

85
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:44,500
Like contracts and termination fees and
all this legal bullshit with telling you

86
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,650
buy a phone, you have [inaudible]
by phone, you have it, it's yours.

87
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,780
And then if you want to cancel,
then we tell them,

88
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,290
go fuck yourself and you just cancel and
that's it. And you're in, you're out,

89
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,430
you do whatever you want to do. That's
how it should be. You know, this, uh,

90
00:04:56,470 --> 00:05:00,140
this idea about, you
know, being able to, uh,

91
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:03,190
control people with contracts. It's
fucking gross. I don't like it.

92
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:04,603
I don't like it,
Brian.

93
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:06,760
Oh, I get it. It's so cheap though.

94
00:05:06,761 --> 00:05:10,600
And they have family plants now where you
can like add somebody for really cheap.

95
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,020
So if you have a girlfriend you get,
throw her on your plan, check it out.

96
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,180
You can just go to plan.
It's going to take a look at
the different points. Rogan,

97
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:18,820
[inaudible] dot com if you go there,

98
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,640
you could see all the different
cell phones they sell as well.

99
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:24,460
Like Brian was showing them on
the screen earlier. They have, um,

100
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,490
like some serious high end android phones.

101
00:05:27,491 --> 00:05:31,600
The one I got is the Samsung Galaxy
s five. I just got it. Love it.

102
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,040
You know what else I love about it?
It's water resistant. Like it did the,

103
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,890
the bottom of it. It plugs in and
you can throw it in the toilet

104
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,710
if you want it to.
It'll be okay.

105
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:45,400
He use it as toilet paper and throw it
allowed to do that until you can't wipe

106
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,030
your ass on it. Cause then you'll
get like, but if he just dropped it.

107
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:52,530
Have you ever dropped your
phone at the moment? I've
dropped my phone. Yeah, I got,

108
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,880
yeah, we all have while on poop and
I had to grab it. Yeah. Yeah. I've,

109
00:05:56,881 --> 00:05:58,130
I've dropped it while brushing

110
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,290
my teeth in the sank and
got water all over it.

111
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:04,940
I fucked phones up before dropping them.
But with, um, these, uh, galaxy s five,

112
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,783
you don't have to worry about that.

113
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,050
Actually the bottom closes
ups got a little tab that
closes in on the bottom and

114
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:12,200
the top. Apparently you can go under
water with these fucking things.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,840
A lot of people think I was stupid.

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,410
I said that story about having to
suck the water out of my phone. Like,

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,360
cause a lot of people throw it in rice
and I'm always like get the water out of

118
00:06:20,361 --> 00:06:21,910
their first smart and sweet.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,150
But a lot of people have said that that
was the dumbest thing they ever heard.

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,720
And so I went online to all this
Howard forms and I researched it. No,

121
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,940
that totally makes sense.
Get the water out of there.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,890
Maybe he's a vacuum
cleaner if you have one,

123
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,860
probably wouldn't be as good as your
mouth because your mouth would seal it,

124
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,070
you know,
and you could get a good amount of yeah,

125
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,780
I can get a good amount of
suction with that. Yeah.

126
00:06:41,781 --> 00:06:45,140
And just fucking be a man about it. And
you know, brushing teeth afterwards,

127
00:06:45,141 --> 00:06:45,321
you know,

128
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:49,310
suck your phone at least go has invented
this pack that you put a phone in.

129
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,810
If it's got wet and you put it in this
in more liquid, which sounds crazy,

130
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:57,490
but it counteracts what the was doing.
Absolutely bizarre.

131
00:06:57,491 --> 00:07:00,290
I was apparently it would have been
huge because their plan was to put it in

132
00:07:00,291 --> 00:07:05,070
airports but because it's a bag of liquid.
Oh did you go cause cause,

133
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:07,640
cause I really like the perfect thing to
have an [inaudible] but yeah you put it

134
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:11,900
in and it's so yeah, we count
as well. What does someone else,

135
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:14,300
so it's not just, it's the, it's
not just the fact it's liquid,

136
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:16,970
it's something in it that
erodes everything wearing

137
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,740
I wonder what it is.

138
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,350
I remember they were doing those
things where there were dipping phones.

139
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:24,170
You remember that you'd send off a
phone to a company. They still do that.

140
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:27,860
They even sell it now. I'd just like
Lowe's. You can buy the same chemical now.

Real. Yeah. You could dip your own phone.

142

143
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:38,310
I wasn't paying attention. I
was trying to avoid, you know,

144
00:07:38,311 --> 00:07:40,290
I don't remember that at all man.
I really don't.

145
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,180
They sell it now and do it yourself.
Yeah.

146
00:07:42,181 --> 00:07:44,070
They said you did it on one
of your spots. No, no, no.

147
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,500
I remember it cause we talked about
it and we set a commercial about,

148
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,480
I don't remember. Just been too
many God damn podcast. Fuck. So how,

149
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:52,470

Like you just, yeah, it's pretty easy.

150
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,400
You can just do that then. I don't know.
You can like different clothes in it.

151
00:07:56,401 --> 00:08:00,090
Like if you work outside a lot, your
shoes, your, your, your shoes. So you do,

in this bullshit. Are you?

153
00:08:02,221 --> 00:08:05,670
Because what about the screen? Is it fuck
with a screen? I don't, I don't know.

154
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,270
Here I'll show you what you did. No,
let's just get through this commercial.

155
00:08:09,271 --> 00:08:13,200
People are mad p I get some of my tweets

00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:37,950
the podcast that commercials are now
officially over scrupulous pip is here.

164
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,470
Let's just get cracking with
this thing. Well, shall we

165
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:47,170

166
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:52,660
What's happening in fellow. I'm
good man. How you doing? It's been

167
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,070
cool to talk to you from the moment
you got here 20 plus minutes ago.

168
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:58,380
Been hanging out with, did
a lot of talking. Yeah,

169
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,210
Jack Black was a really cool dude at
tennis and some crazy stories of Russia,

170
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,030
but yeah. Yeah, he's tired.
He was telling us some,

171
00:09:06,031 --> 00:09:09,840
Robin black was telling us some
awesome stories of uh, these, uh,

172
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,580
Russian dudes that, uh, he
partied with these sumo wrestlers.

173
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:18,840
It was insane that like what what he was
saying was like, it was so ridiculous.

174
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:23,150
The stories of access and drinking and
waking up covered in urine. And uh,

175
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:27,060
we videotaped it. So a Jamie, Jamie,
Jamie, we'll put that shit up later,

176
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:30,310
but it was really funny. He was a, he was
a cool dude, man. I really liked Robin.

177
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:35,880
Yeah. Interesting guy. Um, from
another country he is as our user. Yes.

178
00:09:35,881 --> 00:09:38,280
Indeed.
I am all the way from England.

179
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,020
I saw your shit on my message board was
the first time I saw your shit. Yeah.

180
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,500
Some people would put up a, one
of the videos was a view. Uh,

181
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,070
you're cutting your hair. Yeah.
You're in Walsh and introduction.

182
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:52,800
That's a great fucking [inaudible]. That's
really fun. A hundred pounds on that,

183
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:57,950
on that video did you, was my complete
budget. Can we play that? Play that?

184
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:02,280
Let's play that and talk about it.
Brian. Pull it up. It's a introduction.

185
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,880
You got to tell them how to spell it.

186
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,280
This is my foot was row
for picking the name.

187
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,420
This ridiculously hard to spell
and pronounce and yeah, it's,

188
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,510
it's scribbious pips. A tough one for
Twitter's. No easy, no easy to fit in.

189
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,310
Some people do. They try. Oh, you,
yeah, yeah. They try ous. Yeah. Mm.

190
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,090
Screws. Yeah, they get it
in the end. Eventually.

191
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,853
Here we go.

192
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,710
So the dead fish on the pavement and for,
what did you expect?

193
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,890
There's no wall around these stupid.
She just stayed where it was wet.

194
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,080
You gotta see this.

195
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,880
I don't to leave miss pip and I would
like to see some deliveries into this

196
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:44,550
microphone.

197
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,380
This amplified so you can he read
his piece of diction is the Intro to

198
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:52,130
distraction pieces or some of the shit
that flies around my head and keeps me

199
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:55,820
seamless. It's actually often for
former fucking brain fools anorexic.

200
00:10:56,030 --> 00:11:00,380
So many typers. When our right
a wall claim. I'm dyslexic.
I'll go you poem here.

201
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:01,460
I've put it in December.

202
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,210
I'm setting fire to wait and
hope you all can read the smoke.

203
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,450
Most people where my live don't
know me and I fucking like it.

204
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:11,540
Some people were barley formuli
me how to fucking nowhere.

205
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:14,270
Somebody for an open naval

206
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:21,050
[inaudible] retention
[inaudible] they are just words.

207
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:51,240
You give them power
was covered by Lilly.

208
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:55,690
Pros is original. Now
I'm repeating what I say.

209
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,223
This could

210
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:04,950
be an excuse to run into this all
brandished the [inaudible] vista,

211
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,410
right?
Benny

212
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:20,670
[inaudible] too intrusive.

213
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,060
You see a mouse trap?

214
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:46,061
I'll see free cheese and a
fucking challenge you say
[inaudible] that is great.

215
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,070
That's really fun man.

216
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:15,520
I really enjoy that. I thought the
lyrics are cool. I like how I did it.

217
00:13:15,521 --> 00:13:19,780
It was interesting and crazy because we've
failed that in just a metal container

218
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,890
and the guard who had rented the off,

219
00:13:20,891 --> 00:13:23,710
we didn't tell him what the fuck we were
doing cause I figured we can only do it

220
00:13:23,711 --> 00:13:26,140
in one take because I've got
a shaved my head and shit.

221
00:13:26,141 --> 00:13:30,220
So I thought if be doesn't, if we ask
him, he can say no. Right. If we do it,

222
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:33,760
he can just tell us off afterwards
and, and that's that. So as you finish,

223
00:13:33,761 --> 00:13:36,610
obviously there's tons of fire.
We say Cheryl farm,

224
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:40,450
we have to have the doors closed because
of in, oh, so in a metal container,

225
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,860
which was burned and everything.

226
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,770
And then our powered out with smoke
bellowing and the guy just walked past and

227
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,630
sweat pip. I don't even want to
know more Tom. Like good man.

228
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:54,710
Good man. The die. What a great scene.
You coming out of a video shoot,

229
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,630
shaved
your head shaved.

230
00:14:01,631 --> 00:14:05,650
And the fucking door opens to a storage
container in this smoke bellowing out.

231
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:09,220
What a great scene. That's rock and
roll, man. That's some real shit.

232
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:12,610
The beauty of direct in all your own
videos is you don't have to do health and

233
00:14:12,611 --> 00:14:14,480
safety sheet. You don't have
to take that off, isn't it?

234
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,440
There's no one to say you can't do that.
It's like, yeah, we can fucking do that.

235
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,350
You, how did you get started
rapping, man, we'll let you, do you,

236
00:14:21,351 --> 00:14:25,570
do you consider that rap or you kind of,
I mean, I started off in spoken word,

237
00:14:25,571 --> 00:14:30,130
so I started off just kind of weave,
no beat spies into hip hop. And again,

238
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:34,450
a lot of people hear spoken word and
think that sales shit basically and poetry

239
00:14:34,451 --> 00:14:39,050
in it. But I was exactly the same.
Um, spoken word has potential, right?

240
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:43,630
What do people like being people love?
I have a dream.

241
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,910
I have a dream is God damn spoken word.

242
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,890
I mean Martin Luther King's
I have a dream speech,

243
00:14:47,891 --> 00:14:51,010
which is why I always refer
to it as spoken word are
rather than poetry anything.

244
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:55,670
Because that's the most literal
right. Jan, I mean a really an,

245
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:59,690
an intricate stand up set. This like
one piece that's a whole story. That's,

246
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,050
that's spoken word.
It's just does not word poetry does poet,

247
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,760
does that have a bad connotation?

248
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:07,510
Like a pretentious kind of tapers off
from people kind of think you're dead,

249
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,440
right?
If you say,

250
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:14,441
I remember I was at the comedy cellar
in New York and David tells onstage and

251
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:18,560
he's killing and there's this snotty
fucking the audience and for some reason

252
00:15:18,561 --> 00:15:22,770
the guide took offense to want to Dave's
jokes and says something and, and uh,

253
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:24,790
Dave was like, well I'm sorry
sir. I'm just trying to hear.

254
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:28,420
You're trying to do some
jokes. What do you do for a
living, sir? No, he's fucking,

255
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:33,020
the guy goes, I'm a poet published
and I'll never forget that.

256
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,440
I never for a year I would say
that to people. I'm a poet,

257
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:41,620
published like trying to get
insurance and shit like that.

258
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:45,650
I'd just try and explain what I do and
then just go with unemployed or self

259
00:15:45,651 --> 00:15:49,230
employed cause itself. They put
poetry on Ma. Oh my thing, this,

260
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,930
I'll never forget that asshole.

261
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:55,910
I'm a poet published and he had like
fashionable clothes on shit. You know,

262
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:59,240
he's just totally lives at
home still with his mom.

263
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:03,550
[inaudible] David Tell doesn't even
remember it. But I remember it.

264
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:08,420
It wasn't even me that got
heckled fuck heads. But yeah,

265
00:16:08,421 --> 00:16:09,980
so obviously I'm not in love with poetry.

266
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,610
I started doing it because
I was in kind of like some,

267
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:18,670
some punk bands and shit like that and
I got sick of relying on dramas that mum

268
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:22,400
like giving them a lift to practice and
the basis can't make it because he's

269
00:16:22,401 --> 00:16:24,140
working in night shift and shit like that.

270
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,290
So I was looking at what I could
do and succeed or fail on my own.

271
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:30,380
Like I love the buzz of the fact that if
it went well, it's my fault if I fail,

272
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,950
I can't say always this other guy's fault.
That's a real problem with bands, Huh?

273
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:34,400
Yeah.

274
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,360
Eddie Bravo was trying to explain to me
like the trials and tribulations at the

275
00:16:38,361 --> 00:16:41,420
average band goes through and I was
thinking about it when we had the

276
00:16:41,421 --> 00:16:43,850
conversation. I'm like, I never
even thought about that before.

277
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:48,440
But dealing with all those egos together
and then also some people that are just

278
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,150
undisciplined. Yeah, completely.

279
00:16:50,151 --> 00:16:53,270
Some people aren't as passionate about
it as you are or it's just a fun thing

280
00:16:53,271 --> 00:16:57,170
for them and equally accepting
gigs and shit and shit like that.

281
00:16:57,171 --> 00:16:59,690
You have to ring through like
four or five other people to say,

282
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:02,930
can we accept this Gig
site? Yeah. Soulful, full.

283
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:07,270
To me that's kind of why I started
doing spoken word. Um, yeah.

284
00:17:07,370 --> 00:17:09,110
So I could do it all off of my own bath.

285
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:11,440
It was just a height of
being in bands really.

286
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,110
They know what I like
about what you did to, um,

287
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:19,990
for whatever reason there's a lot of guys
who speak a certain way and then when

288
00:17:20,391 --> 00:17:23,850
they performed wrap, it sounds like
an urban black guy. Yeah, completely.

289
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,460
Very strange.
It's like what?

290
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,150
What happened that you had to start
doing it like this because that's not how

291
00:17:29,151 --> 00:17:33,890
you would talk in real life.
Miss, I was raised in the hood,

292
00:17:33,891 --> 00:17:37,340
but I'm strong from my, you know,
it's, there's, there's like,

293
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,560
it blows my mind that people,

294
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,450
the most common thing that people say
to me after shows and that is like, oh,

295
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:45,200
you sound exactly. I like doing recall.
Does that, cause this is my voice.

296
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,010
This is me talking this article about

297
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,750
why, uh, people with a British accent
sing in an American accent. You know,

298
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:58,860
I don't remember what the fucking
conclusion was. I barely, essentially,

299
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:02,160
I looked at it, I'm like, who cares? They
just choose to, you know, you could chew,

300
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,690
but if there's a difference between an
English guy choosing to sound American

301
00:18:06,691 --> 00:18:09,270
and American guy choosing
to sound British,

302
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:13,260
cause if an English guy comes over to
America and loses his British accent,

303
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,300
nobody's gonna give him
a hard time about it.

304
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,110
But if an American got takes on a
British accent, get the fuck outta here.

305
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:23,280
But Madonna can live in London. Tiller
tits, fall off. You're not British.

306
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,060
Cut it out. Cut it out.
Cut it out. Madonna.

307
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,400
Don't feel fucking bought a house there.
That rich bitch,

308
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,010
she bought a house there just so
she could talk in an English accent.

309
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,840
I just want to be one of the loads.
Come on my,

310
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:41,400
I am Madonna. I am a dancer. Slash singer.

311
00:18:41,401 --> 00:18:44,160
Slash superstore was
Madonna Madonna at night.

312
00:18:44,161 --> 00:18:49,020
Did she should be hand fucking,

313
00:18:49,021 --> 00:18:49,501
what's his name?

314
00:18:49,501 --> 00:18:52,710
Elton John was listening to a
country comfort on the way over here.

315
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:57,240
Just randomly sometimes like my iPhone
syncs up with my a car, just a play.

316
00:18:57,241 --> 00:18:57,871
You know,
how does it,

317
00:18:57,871 --> 00:19:01,110
sometimes I'll just play random song
and it just started playing. Um,

318
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,690
it's on one of my playlists,
but that Elton John Song,

319
00:19:03,691 --> 00:19:07,470
country comfort that mother
fucker cause sing his ass off.

320
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,770
God Damn Elton John's good.
You're just like,

321
00:19:10,771 --> 00:19:14,850
there's so much emotion and power in
his songs, you know, it's just like,

322
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:16,250
it takes you right to what he said.

323
00:19:16,251 --> 00:19:20,790
He's thinking like it's a bout grandma
and needing help to fix her barn.

324
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:24,570
You know like this and you like you
see in the whole thing play out.

325
00:19:24,571 --> 00:19:29,430
You see in fields of wheat and butterflies
and an old lady and Elton John's a

326
00:19:29,431 --> 00:19:30,240
bad motherfucker.

327
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,290
Does he stay on lockout and Joan and
when he sings, that's not really right.

328
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,810
It's kind of, it's not really an
American accent though, is it?

329
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:41,460
It's Kinda hard to say. Hard to say
because the, when you're singing you're,

330
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,560
you're extending these words.

331
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:48,010
She needed me. He sang farm and it's
taken him like 10 seconds. Yeah.

332
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:52,730
Sneeze him helped him on the phone.
Nobody talks like that.

333
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,920
Yeah. So it's like I've got to start. I,
so I do kind of talk a lot about this.

334
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,910
This might end up in a really long
podcasts that normally three hours,

335
00:19:59,911 --> 00:20:03,600
this will be like six hours, seven
hours. So lock yourselves in,

336
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,770
sing into weird thing, man.
Singing is a beautiful thing,

337
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,090
but spoken word to music is a very
different thing. Spoken word to music.

338
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,090
It's very lyrical. Um, uh,

339
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,840
lyrically dependent. That's
the word for it. It's like,

340
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,230
that was what I really enjoyed about
your stuff was it was very clever.

341
00:20:22,231 --> 00:20:25,320
I could see that you put a lot of thought
into the your lyrics and what you're,

342
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:28,530
you know, and I love the thing about
Lenny Bruce, it's like, you know,

343
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:32,100
you covered it in a really cool way.
It's kind of neat.

344
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,110
Also tell it was one take [inaudible]
w whenever I'm running and he's,

345
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,210
the main goal was to make you
interested in, to me kind of thing.

346
00:20:39,211 --> 00:20:43,110
And that's why I think confuses me about
a lot of hip hop when it is all just

347
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:44,640
talking about the same thing.

348
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:47,980
It's like I'd get bored performing that
or doing that over and over again. So

349
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:51,070
it's kind of, you know what that
exists. I think in every art form.

350
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,000
I bet it exists in rock and roll. I
bet. I mean, I know it exists in comedy,

351
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:55,961
you know,
there's,

352
00:20:55,961 --> 00:21:00,160
there's certain subjects that guys will
cover when you can tell they're covering

353
00:21:00,161 --> 00:21:03,260
it because they think that the
audience wants to hear that. Yeah.

354
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:06,310
And it's not like what's actually
interesting to them. Yeah.

355
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:11,190
I can't imagine getting excited finishing
the line or finishing a piece of,

356
00:21:11,191 --> 00:21:14,680
that's just exactly that kind of,
I think people enjoy that.

357
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,780
There's a lot of people
that do do that though.

358
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,450
It's weird like those hip
maker guys so like sit down,

359
00:21:19,451 --> 00:21:23,380
they write these songs that they know
specifically we'll hit like a target

360
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,100
nurses understand that cause cause they've
run that for someone else to have to

361
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:31,540
perform and resale. They're sold every
night to kind of sing and get through.

362
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,830
I can understand that
because they just go,

363
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:37,510
I'm going to write this to make a fuck
ton of money and then hand this over to

364
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:41,620
some other guy to wasn't there a home up
there and wasn't there a band where the

365
00:21:41,621 --> 00:21:44,620
lead singer was like one of those guys
that would like write songs for a lot of

366
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:48,340
like train didn't isn't
that what I'm thinking of

367
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,190
now? But what it was that there's
this, what the fuck was trained?

368
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,950
There was this one band.
Fuck I'm not going to remember.

369
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,601
I'm not going to remember.

370
00:21:58,601 --> 00:22:01,870
But I remember this as big as
the one who writes the songs for,

371
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,370
well he made headway in our work does,

372
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:07,360
he released himself and it was
pretty recently and it was a big hit,

373
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,790
but it was like one of
those songs were like,

374
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,540
I couldn't get into it cause
it was like it was well done,

375
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:17,810
but I could tell that it was like a
calculated things ticking over the book

376
00:22:17,811 --> 00:22:20,200
cause he's got formula
that makes it worse. Yeah.

377
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:24,010
As opposed to like there's certain
songs you know where like you don't,

378
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:29,470
you don't even know why you like it.
Like there's this, um, there's this, uh,

379
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:33,940
old Leonard Skinner Song, the battle of
Curtis Lowe. Yeah. You know, and it's,

380
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:36,140
it's one of those songs were like you,

381
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,120
the battle ballad rather of Curtis Lowe
and it's one of those songs. We hear it.

382
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:45,450
You don't even know what is going on
that this song is just captivating me in

383
00:22:47,621 --> 00:22:51,130
such a unique way.
Like cha making me emotional,

384
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:55,780
like making me feel that moment and tell
when they feel like that'd been written.

385
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:56,611
A lot of that.

386
00:22:56,611 --> 00:23:00,010
Like one of the things I liked about the
way that song introduction kind of blew

387
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:04,090
up was no one kind of notice for
ages that it's not got a chorus,

388
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,820
it's not got a hook, right.
It's no good anything.

389
00:23:06,821 --> 00:23:09,550
And he was kind of that people didn't
notice that because they were kind of

390
00:23:09,570 --> 00:23:12,670
captivated and into it and
didn't think about all right,

391
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,390
you meant a kind of go verse, chorus
verse, Chorus, bridge, you know,

392
00:23:16,391 --> 00:23:16,990
this kind of shit.

393
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,130
So it's kind of Nice when that works
and you can tell it's just, he's just,

394
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,320
uh, just what came out and
what was natural. But you
pieced that together, right?

395
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:30,490
Like that's a piece. Like
you started working on that,
you've developed it. Do you,

396
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:33,430
when you, when you do something
like that and you develop a piece,

397
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,650
do you write it all out and like what,

398
00:23:35,651 --> 00:23:38,740
like how long is that whole song is
about three and a half months or so.

399
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,630
Three and a half minutes.
Yeah. And do you,

400
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,260
do you develop it at three and a half
minutes? Do you add to it along the way?

401
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,130
Because it completely written before

402
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,050
you ever get to the stage.
Yes.

403
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:50,720
It's all completely written
before I get to this stage.

404
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,310
A lot of of that song in particular,

405
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:56,370
I mean I'm no in stuff on my phone
all the time. Um, and just, yeah,

406
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,350
am making note of just good lines
are good ideas or topics or subjects.

407
00:24:00,351 --> 00:24:03,410
I'd be have like a new line I just pops
into your head and you want to add just

408
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,460
Mike and I mean in Emma notes.

409
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,110
Otherwise I'm going to have
something awful in there now. Um,

410
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:11,210
but it would just be notes even if it's
just even if it didn't align or a turn

411
00:24:11,211 --> 00:24:16,070
of phrase I on my last note was saying
about how loads of rappers at the moment

412
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:20,390
of going on about game based mode,
beast mode be anything.

413
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:23,360
I've just written one sign through
one about going Depeche mode.

414
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,970
They said that's literally,
there's no lyric.

415
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:29,060
They have no structured that
yet but right. It's just right.

416
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:31,310
I'll do something with that.
So they don't have a song about that.

417
00:24:31,311 --> 00:24:34,460
Cause a lot of my songs are stories
as well though. So, but one like that,

418
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:39,461
it's easy to go through these kinds of
weird little ideas or phrases or even

419
00:24:39,791 --> 00:24:42,590
like my bitsa philosophy and shit
and shit like that just to go right.

420
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,300
I'll put that in there.
Right.

421
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:47,030
That's the coolest thing about
creating your own stuff right. As it,

422
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:51,360
you could just decide what goes in,
you could decide. And it's just,

423
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,071
I mean,

424
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:55,400
the thing that I buzzed about it the
most is that you don't know what's good

425
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,820
until you put it out there
by genuinely on, on that one,

426
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:00,620
there's a line or you see a mouse trap.

427
00:25:00,621 --> 00:25:05,621
I see free cheese and F if I can challenge
it was just one of loads of lines.

428
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,980
And then when that came out,

429
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:09,700
it's the one that everyone was going
crazy on and everyone was tweeting.

430
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:14,730
So I had no idea that that was the
standout because you're so in it that,

431
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,910
yeah. Yeah. It's got so
much to you put it together.

432
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:19,970
So that was one of many stand
now that the whole thing,

433
00:25:19,971 --> 00:25:21,500
there's a lot of great lyrics in that,
but yeah,

434
00:25:21,501 --> 00:25:26,450
that's definitely a standout
part of it. That's, uh,
that's, that's really cool man.

435
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,030
I love anything like that where it's
like one guy piecing something together,

436
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,850
whether it's music or whether it's
a book like talking to an author,

437
00:25:34,851 --> 00:25:38,810
but creating a book or whether it's a
stand up comedian creating an act or a guy

438
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:41,510
writing a, uh, you know,
moving or anything. It's just,

439
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:45,920
there's something about that creative
process so much more now with us.

440
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:49,670
So much more acceptable and doable because
of the Internet and because of being

441
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:53,540
out to get whatever your one passion is
out there that you can kind of just be,

442
00:25:53,570 --> 00:25:56,360
it doesn't have to be a team of right
as a team of people doing this and that

443
00:25:56,361 --> 00:26:01,361
you can find a lot more people who've got
that just one vision and then just see

444
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,130
where it turns into. Yeah. Yeah.

445
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:09,160
And when you like have this one thing
that comes out of your own mind and you

446
00:26:10,521 --> 00:26:14,210
put it together and you, it's like we
were talking about this with comedy.

447
00:26:14,211 --> 00:26:16,400
Like when somebody becomes a pip fan,

448
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,730
like you're the only one that can give
them that stuff like that. Then she,

449
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,980
they were looking to see what comes out
of your head. Yeah. You know, as crazy as,

450
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:28,160
as, as, as well though. And I get,
I'm sure it's the same with stand up.

451
00:26:28,161 --> 00:26:31,490
It's that weird thing of all of it.
As much as you put into it,

452
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,950
it's just what you think at the time.
So a,

453
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:38,090
but then it's committed to record and
that's that. So five years down the line,

454
00:26:38,091 --> 00:26:42,230
my opinions or views by odd hope, my
opinions and views will change in general,

455
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,620
let on everything.

456
00:26:43,621 --> 00:26:47,250
But I think it's important to develop
ideas and philosophies are constantly,

457
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,560
so it's in that weird thing
that people will have got that,

458
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:54,630
that first record and being of listened
to that one phrase or thing over and

459
00:26:54,631 --> 00:26:57,600
over and it's become their kind of
mantra. And then you're like, yeah,

460
00:26:57,601 --> 00:27:01,530
I kind of know into that as much anymore.
I'm kind of delving into this shit now.

461
00:27:01,531 --> 00:27:04,080
This is what's going on now. And
this, it's weird how that, yeah,

462
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:09,060
that can be the thing that you can either
give them what they need or you can't,

463
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,240
if you know what I mean. Right.
It's natural development.

464
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Hip Hop seems to be in a way a lot like
standup comedy in that it's kind of

465
00:27:17,671 --> 00:27:22,530
generic and turn. Yup. But it's
very broad in terms of content.

466
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:27,210
It's very completely stupid paper who
say I love comedy or I love hip hop.

467
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,650
You'd have specific comedy and a specific
hip hop. There's loads of shit, comedy,

468
00:27:31,651 --> 00:27:34,380
there's loads of shit. Hip Hop, there's
loads of shit. Shit, shit, spoken word.

469
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:39,530
I like good comedy problems.
Right. You know, I've got my
specifics I like, so yeah,

470
00:27:39,531 --> 00:27:42,060
it's, it's another one that a guy, um,

471
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:45,450
I work with sometimes sage Francis
was saying in an interview recently,

472
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:49,200
it's got to the point now where
when people talk about hip hop,

473
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,740
you can't assume that they're talking
about the same thing as him. And again,

474
00:27:52,741 --> 00:27:56,980
I think that's because it's so broad.
There's such a variation in there. Yeah.

475
00:27:57,110 --> 00:28:01,830
Yeah. There's a giant broad variation
and it's interesting. It's like a,

476
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,920
if you went to a club and it
just said rock and roll, we'll,

477
00:28:04,921 --> 00:28:07,920
you'd know it would be rock and roll.
But if you went to a club just said music,

478
00:28:07,921 --> 00:28:12,030
well hip hop is like,
it's such a very specific type of music,

479
00:28:12,031 --> 00:28:16,200
but inside the genre there's like a bunch
of different variables, right? Yeah,

480
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,550
hugely.
Again,

481
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:21,870
when our I f I first started off and I
was talking about and trying to get my

482
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:22,704
name out there,

483
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:28,160
I'd struggled to describe what I do
because if I said hip hop and people

484
00:28:28,351 --> 00:28:31,460
instantly thought with 50 cent or
cane because of 50 cent or candies,

485
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,870
like you're not going to
be happy with what you get.

486
00:28:33,871 --> 00:28:36,690
Or equally they might be put off because
they're not into that and it's like,

487
00:28:36,691 --> 00:28:40,410
well this might not be right. They
might think that you would, you know,

488
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:45,180
you'd be affecting a certain type
of behavior and exactly. They think,

489
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm going to speak in an American accent
and B, are you allowed to say wicker?

490
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:51,310
Is that, is it a, is wigger a a white guy?

491
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:56,610
Liga has it become an issue?
It doesn't seem like it.

492
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,660
Like you can call someone that and it's
not like dropping an n bomb. Right? Like,

493
00:29:00,661 --> 00:29:04,170
even though it sounds a lot like it
with a w you're allowed to let us slide.

494
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,130
It's fine and don't have a heart,

495
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,510
but there is that kind and
then there's what you're doing,

496
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:11,370
which is like a completely
different thing.

497
00:29:11,371 --> 00:29:14,010
Like you're talking and
you're making sure Brian,

498
00:29:14,011 --> 00:29:16,920
but you're also making statements
and it's very entertaining,

499
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,670
but it says it's a form of hip hop,
but it's a very different form of hip hop.

500
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,920
Yeah, yeah, completely. And it's key.

501
00:29:22,921 --> 00:29:26,430
It's the entertainment part is key as
well because I think a lot of people who

502
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,700
do the more conscious stuff, it's
just like, yeah, it's a lecture.

503
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,211
You know what I mean?

504
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:32,640
You kind of just being fed this
and it feels like they can't.

505
00:29:32,641 --> 00:29:34,740
Trying to get across just how
intelligent they are and all this.

506
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:38,940
I'm kind of in all my stuff. It's trying
to open up discussion rather than say,

507
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:41,910
here's the the beginning and end of,
of

508
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:42,910
of this subject.

509
00:29:42,911 --> 00:29:45,730
It's kind of saying like there's some
shit that we should maybe all think about

510
00:29:45,731 --> 00:29:50,200
a bit more or discuss a musical culture
in general more but not trying to say

511
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,790
I've got all the answers. Here's, yeah,
here's my shake I name. Yeah. Yeah.

512
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:59,020
I love the fact that there's so many
different genres in hip hop now cause I

513
00:29:59,021 --> 00:30:03,610
think that uh, I've always been a fan
of, I'm a fan of all kinds of different,

514
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:08,050
like I'm a fan of your style but I'm also
like a big fan of like old school Geto

515
00:30:08,051 --> 00:30:11,770
boys, you know, completely.
I've got over a radio. Damn.

516
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:13,120
It feels good to be a gangster.

517
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:17,320
Came on the radio the other day and
I was like fuck, this is the shit.

518
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,960
This song is the shit.
That's how you,

519
00:30:18,961 --> 00:30:22,270
for fingers when I'm in La is because
you've got radio stations that just play

520
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,330
just old hip hop and proper kind of
hip hop or all day long and yeah,

521
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:30,010
I don't have that in the UK.
I miss Scarface.

522
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,390
Scarface still putting out shit is
a new track like six months ago too.

523
00:30:35,391 --> 00:30:37,290
I'm need to,
I need to get back in scar face.

524
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,030
I forgot what a good rapper
he a diary was. Damn.

525
00:30:40,031 --> 00:30:42,780
It feels good to be against that.

526
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,090
And that album cover with the
guy's eyeball hanging out. Yeah.

527
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,020
We can't be stopped. Geto
boys, man. That's Bushwick.

528
00:30:50,021 --> 00:30:54,760
Bill shot himself in the eye there.
They were the craziest.

529
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,630
Yeah, that was some
fun fucking music, man.

530
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:01,790
My mind is playing tricks
on me, dude. Dude, dude.

531
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,930
I was Joe. I was at, when I
was in at Florida for doing
comedy just last weekend,

532
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:13,020
there was this fetish con going on
and so it was like Mark Marin, uh,

533
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,190
you know Chris harder going,

534
00:31:14,191 --> 00:31:17,110
a few of us just all hanging out
this bar watching all these freaks.

535
00:31:17,111 --> 00:31:21,100
It was like being at like a AVN with
dominatrix is and people in gimp suits and

536
00:31:21,101 --> 00:31:23,500
stuff like that. Wow.
And there was this woman,

537
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,030
this guy that was dressed up as a woman
with a face mask on and she just stared

538
00:31:28,031 --> 00:31:31,240
at us and didn't move in the face.
Masks had this creepy like smile on it.

539
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,210
And it was the most disturbing thing ever.
I have a photo of it somewhere.

540
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,610
Just fetish people.
Yeah, just fetish people.

541
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,200
And then in Jacksonville I went
to this borough bar and uh,

542
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,350
there was a band that was about to start
in the next room and out of nowhere

543
00:31:44,351 --> 00:31:48,520
this band jumps off stage and goes into
the room that the bar area that we're at

544
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,680
and starts playing right into the crowd,
like jumping on like,

545
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,620
like the tables of the bar and stuff.

546
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:57,640
And then at the end they caught the
symbols on fire and that place was like on

547
00:31:57,641 --> 00:32:01,960
fire. It was the most intense,
amazing band I've ever seen.

548
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,610
And it was just like a band. I just popped
into a bar and saw this amazing band.

549
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:09,430
And so if you should check out
the video sometime of them,

550
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:12,400
they're really interesting band, but
it's cool seeing like libraries, music,

551
00:32:12,401 --> 00:32:16,840
combat. Uh, their name is doc. Oh, hold
on. I want to make sure I say this right.

552
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:21,040
Daca Sui or something like that.
It's a

553
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:26,320
hello here. I'll get it to
you. Yeah. People online that
are listening. Yeah, yeah.

554
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:29,580
Here I'll find it. I'll find the proper
spelling. I'll be right back. Okay.

555
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:31,440
All right.
Um,

556
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,170
I don't know where the fuck we were going
before you just derailed Gary. Sorry.

557
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,333
It's

558
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:40,220
d a n I k a.
J

559
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:44,990
you and the inside that's me is pip
was tough, Huh? Yeah, right. Bam.

560
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:47,750
That's ridiculous. And here, here's
actually them playing outdoors,

561
00:32:47,751 --> 00:32:50,130
which is completely
different than what you'd

562
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,220
normalcy. The lead singer. The guy right
there in the face mask hasn't seen mass.

563
00:32:55,221 --> 00:32:58,130
That was at the fetish con that was
just staring at us the whole time.

564
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
Wow.
This is kind of wow.

565
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,530
Uh,

566
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,400
[inaudible] [inaudible]

567
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:31,230
you could imagine the Admin,

568
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:35,780
a small bar and like things are on fire
in front of you moms. These are good.

569
00:33:35,781 --> 00:33:36,614
These guys are good.

570
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:41,210
That's a bad mother fucker.

571
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,700
[inaudible]

572
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:22,080
you couldn't hear and you didn't hear
sound and you were trying to figure out

573
00:34:22,081 --> 00:34:24,990
what the fuck to make this totally silent.

574
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,510
Imagine if you didn't hear sound and you
see all this moving around and see all

575
00:34:29,511 --> 00:34:34,370
these people staring at these guys just
playing with these sticks in their hands.

576
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,020
You'd be like, what the fuck
is going on? On that stage?

577
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:43,760
Why is everybody watching that? It,
it's this, it's a weird Gig, man.

578
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,520
You're creating cool sounds with a stick.
Yeah. You get this big piece of wood,

579
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:52,460
you creating wild sounds with it. That's
really interesting. Here's, here's how I

580
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:57,920
[inaudible] just walking
around the whole entire bar

581
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,250
wireless and they can be different

582
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,830
guys. Then maybe even have
to do these guys get cocky.

583
00:35:07,831 --> 00:35:12,831
The fucking put a mask on a new dude
firearm and it's good to see that is

584
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,800
learned and moved up to wireless because
clearly the code was restricted him in

585
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:19,320
the first one as he
wanted to go run around.

586
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,270
Here's I'm on top of the bar. He was like
doing this shape. That's cool. One fire.

587
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,970
He was like just leaning on like
sitting on my lap for the most.

588
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:34,190
That's wild.

589
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,970
Yeah. So check them out so they
don't sing. They just play out.

590
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,520
They just jam like fucking crazy
dude. Like style almost. Yeah.

591
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,560
So their name is d.

592
00:35:43,561 --> 00:35:47,730
A. N. I. K. A. I. J. U. D.

593
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:51,480
I like that man. I like that
idea. That's pretty cool.

594
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,410
I love that they've got hard
and aim. To me. That's right.

595
00:35:54,411 --> 00:35:57,600
That's even though you spell it out
twice now. I've no idea what the name is.

596
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:01,730
Arnold Schwarzenegger's to good
fallback. It doesn't matter. It doesn't,

597
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:05,580
it doesn't run shit doesn't mean shit.
Yeah.

598
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,650
Crazy neighbor fuckers. Yeah. It's a
weird thing. And then like the names,

599
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:15,190
it's important to write the
right the right letters and
words never tell if it's,

600
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,790
it's, it's like if, if, if,

601
00:36:17,791 --> 00:36:21,570
if the doors is a good name or it's a
good name because of the doors, Jeremy.

602
00:36:21,571 --> 00:36:24,900
And if so if you were at some shitty Gig
in the local band and the door's never

603
00:36:24,901 --> 00:36:27,730
happened and they were called the doors,
it probably wouldn't be as, as, uh,

604
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:31,080
as awesome as it is. Right. It's,
isn't it fascinating though?

605
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:34,730
The names are about picking
a pleasant sound. Yeah.

606
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,270
That you can remember.
And it's easy to replicate with letters.

607
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,120
Like if you have too many, like what
is this Dika what the fuck is this?

608
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,960
Get out of here with that shit, dude.
No one's going to remember that shit.

609
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,840
And you go anything more about
it now because of the Internet.

610
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,140
Because if you pick a name that too
familiar than when you Google it,

611
00:36:52,141 --> 00:36:57,030
you're going to get, yeah. You know some
crazy. Yeah, whatever it is you've chosen.

612
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,840
Yeah. Right. Stricted yeah.
Especially if you, and what is,

613
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,800
how does it work when you hear bands
of the same name as other bands?

614
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,230
I never know.
I guess someone has to argue it.

615
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:11,850
You know like the love assassins like
this must be like more than one love

616
00:37:11,851 --> 00:37:14,280
assassins. See original regional
love assessment, you know,

617
00:37:14,281 --> 00:37:16,830
I mean I just need that name
up but I'm sure it exists.

618
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:20,550
I'm not the first person that think that
way. Right. That's a path that's like,

619
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:24,840
that's like looking at like a section
of street and trying to imagine that no

620
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:28,170
one ever walked down, that somebody
walked down that I might not have seen it,

621
00:37:28,171 --> 00:37:29,004
but it's happened.

622
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:32,230
So like how many different guys could
come up with something like the love

623
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,180
assassins, you know, you've
just got up become the biggest,

624
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,530
I love assassins out there that
you're going to be the biggest ones.

625
00:37:40,531 --> 00:37:44,940
Then the Yahoo, the love assessments.
Do you think there was another kiss?

626
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,700
Like kiss seems like a go or have been,

627
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:51,660
had to have been at least one other band
thought about becoming the name kiss

628
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,780
set. Probably if he, if,

629
00:37:52,781 --> 00:37:56,460
if somebody kind of retired
or not as popular now you
could just be like, hey no,

630
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:59,550
my name's Nwa now and just
because you're more popular,

631
00:37:59,551 --> 00:38:03,060
you could kind of would win at that
argument. Right. I don't know man.

632
00:38:03,061 --> 00:38:06,330
I think that's probably trademarked
because it's such a huge business.

633
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:10,410
But I think like when you're first
coming up and you don't have any legal

634
00:38:10,411 --> 00:38:12,090
paperwork,
that's when it's only an issue.

635
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,860
Cause like if you tried
to be Jimi Hendrix today,

636
00:38:13,861 --> 00:38:16,630
they'd be like shut the fuck up
pitch change manager. But no, I'm,

637
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:20,550
that's my new name is Jimi Hendrix. I'm
Jimmy Hendrix. But they would be like,

638
00:38:20,551 --> 00:38:24,000
no Jimmy Hendry you can't be a musician
and be Jimi Hendrix. There's fucking,

639
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:26,640
there's a copyright on that shit.
But I could be milli Vanilli.

640
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:31,050
Well no one wants to be so I bet
they would just let you. Yeah.

641
00:38:31,051 --> 00:38:35,130
Have you tried to be Milli Vanilli but
I bet [inaudible] owns that shit. Like,

642
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,130
say if you and Jamie

643
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:39,910
decided to go on tour as Millie and
vanilla and you started doing with like,

644
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:43,600
you would lip sync and other people would
sing the songs. You get your ass sued.

645
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:47,300
Yeah. Yeah, for sure. If he
only did like the vanilla part,

646
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:53,150
even vanilla, they probably own Milli
Vanilli they owned both of those. Yeah.

647
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:55,720
Yeah. They own it. Don't
you think they own it, Ross?

648
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,580
Well,
Rick Ross is different because Rick Ross,

649
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:00,950
the original Rick Ross was not a rapper.
I mean,

650
00:39:00,951 --> 00:39:03,890
that's the whole reason why he has those
tee shirts that say Rick Ross is not a

651
00:39:03,891 --> 00:39:04,310
wrap.

652
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,870
He was just unsigned. He wrapped
all the time in the shower. I bet.

653
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:11,210
[inaudible] Christmas
time. He was rapping. Well,

654
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:13,340
he was a notorious drug dealer,

655
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,160
a genuine nice guy. I really
like Rick Ross. He's a cool guy.

656
00:39:17,161 --> 00:39:21,180
He's got a book out now. By the way,
if, uh, if anybody's interested, um,

657
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:25,620
Rick has a brand new book and people
have been asking us to get him on the

658
00:39:25,621 --> 00:39:30,450
podcast again and we wish definitely
should. Um, Rick Ross book,

659
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:35,760
I'm just giving them plug
the real Rick Ross freeway,

660
00:39:35,761 --> 00:39:39,090
Rick Ross, I'm told by the, yeah,

661
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,440
the untold autobiography, that's
what it's called. And he's a,

662
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:46,800
he's got a fascinating story
if you're interested. His,

663
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:51,801
his story is he was the connection
between the Iran Contra affair and selling

664
00:39:52,351 --> 00:39:54,030
drugs in Los Angeles.

665
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:59,450
He was one of the connections he was
being supplied by a guy who was channeling

666
00:40:00,511 --> 00:40:04,650
that money that he made from Rick
Ross directly into foreign operations.

667
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:09,870
It's crazy. The whole story is crazy.
And the dude, when he went to jail,

668
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:14,160
didn't even know how to read. Okay.
And in jail, taught himself at a read,

669
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:19,310
then became a fucking legal expert
and found the loopholes in his,

670
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,530
uh,
in his prosecution where they fucked up,

671
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,740
found holes in the prosecution's angle
and craziness from God himself off.

672
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,280
Got himself out.

673
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:33,420
They hadn't been like a three
strike situation and he, uh,

674
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:36,150
he got out of that because
it has to be three sentences.

675
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:38,740
It can't be three crimes as
three sentences. So they, they,

676
00:40:38,741 --> 00:40:43,140
they prosecuted for him. It, it,
they prosecuted him for it illegally.

677
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,850
It was incorrect use of the prosecution.

678
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:49,320
It's kind of weird though than that
he wouldn't have educated himself or

679
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,680
potentially wouldn't have educated himself
in such a manner as if he hadn't been

680
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,880
been put away. So it's kind of, it's
odd to come out of that with, you know,

681
00:40:56,881 --> 00:41:00,660
improved and better and yeah.
Yeah. He's a fascinating case.

682
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:03,590
It's a very fascinating case and
he's a very good guy to, you know,

683
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:08,340
put up with Rick Ross or using your name
and they have all these sued him and

684
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,100
lost,

685
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,560
which is really crazy.
I mean one will have a mom,

686
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,850
I'm sure he'll be able to tell us.

687
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:16,390
I don't know if they're a continuing
the lawsuit. Well maybe we can.

688
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:21,490
Right. It's a weird one with that
cause it's more of a regular names.

689
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,870
Jimmy Hendrix that's there. You know,
you're not going to hear that every day.

690
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,000
But Rick Ross,
it feels like it'd be a tougher one to,

691
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:31,990
to sue over cause yeah, I dunno. Yeah.

692
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:33,980
Rick Ross when lawsuit

693
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:37,910
against freeway, Rick Ross. Wow. Freeway.

694
00:41:37,911 --> 00:41:42,911
Rick Ross lost his lawsuit against Rapper
Rick Ross born William Leonard Roberts

695
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,940
on first amendment grounds the
case. Wow. First amendment grounds,

696
00:41:46,941 --> 00:41:51,560
freedom of speech. So I guess you're
allowed to take on the persona of a,

697
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:56,270
a known drug dealer because it's like,
it's a persona.

698
00:41:56,271 --> 00:41:58,640
So it's like artistic expression

699
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:00,730
that it's like Bonnie and Clyde Shit.
You know,

700
00:42:00,731 --> 00:42:03,990
like I can probably call myself Bonnie and
Clyde or by, yeah. But if they were old

701
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:08,780
live, would you be able to, you know?
Yeah. But the full name Rick Ross,

702
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:14,980
the Real Rick Ross knew about the
entertainers stage names since 2006 Oh,

703
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:22,120
that case originally began in 2010 and
later appeal to a higher court after the

704
00:42:22,431 --> 00:42:24,650
lawsuit was ruled untimely.

705
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:29,570
Since the real Rick Ross knew about the
entertainer stage names since 2006 so

706
00:42:29,571 --> 00:42:33,500
the idea was that the first time it was
ruled untimely because he didn't act

707
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:38,150
quick enough, you know, but I think
that there was, there was some issues,

708
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,830
the real Rick Ross said,

709
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:44,980
where he had talked to Rick Ross and like
he was going to be compensated for it.

710
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:48,530
Right. And then memory said he
was going to chop it up with him.

711
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:50,930
Remember that he said, we'll
chop it up, we'll chop it up.

712
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,070
Like he was gonna give him some money
and then he decided not to and then

713
00:42:55,071 --> 00:42:58,490
decided to go to lawsuits with them.
So fucking shady.

714
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,670
Explain why he took time over it and
why he got around to that. But yeah,

715
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:07,840
that and now that is a very
different sort of a hip hop.

716
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:11,740
Yeah, completely pick any say
hip hop I love is everywhere.

717
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:17,760
Is that the people think that just because
I do a certain kind of hip hop that I

718
00:43:18,341 --> 00:43:21,910
think every kind of hip hop should
be like that. It'd be boring as hell.

719
00:43:21,911 --> 00:43:22,744
Liberal Hippo.

720
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:26,530
I was out that you after to have
the variation in the genre and yeah.

721
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,120
How much do you think the real Rick Ross,
she'd get paid by the fake Rick Ross?

722
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:35,650
Like if you were the judge?
Half depends how much the holy shit.

723
00:43:35,651 --> 00:43:40,510
That's crazy. That's like being
married to, that's too much,

724
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:41,070
much.

725
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,820
Maybe 10% though. 10% might
not be upset. 10% seems fast.

726
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:48,750
Look, you didn't even have to
wrap less. That dude uses name.

727
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,990
That dude makes him more popular.
Here's the thing about the real Rick Ross.

728
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:55,650
Emotional sweet. You're a sweet
guy. I like him a lot about you.

729
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:57,900
But here's the thing about,
um,

730
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:01,560
like think about the real Rick Ross
like we know about the real Rick Ross

731
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:04,500
because his story is fascinating and we've
talked to him and he's an interesting

732
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:04,950
guy,

733
00:44:04,950 --> 00:44:09,630
but we also know about the real Rick Ross
because the fake Rick Ross got famous

734
00:44:09,631 --> 00:44:11,430
as fuck with the same name.
Yeah.

735
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:15,090
So how much would you know about Rick
Ross if he wasn't getting fucked over by

736
00:44:15,091 --> 00:44:18,780
the fake Rick Ross? I
submit, not nearly as much.

737
00:44:18,990 --> 00:44:20,700
I submit that quite honestly,

738
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:25,500
the f the real Rick Ross has benefited
substantially from the fake Rick Ross

739
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,353
using his name.

740
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:31,550
And it actually makes him even more legit
because this fake fat rapper used to

741
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:35,730
be a d,
a corrections officer is using his shit.

742
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:37,010
I think the tie their table,

743
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,050
that table has kind of changed
a little since Rick Ross,

744
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,740
the fake Rick Ross has now become
who he is. He's like, you know, big,

745
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:46,530
he is now a huge moneymaker.

746
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:51,240
So now 10% I think is completely fair and
everyone should just be happy and have

747
00:44:51,241 --> 00:44:53,220
dinner together and maybe
going to go on tour together.

748
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,740
But the, the real Rick Ross, the
real Rick, the original drug dealer,

749
00:44:56,741 --> 00:45:01,741
Rick Ross is benefiting substantially
like publicity wise to being connected

750
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:04,960
with this. I mean, he has
an amazing story on his own,

751
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:09,400
but the reality is that this store is
made more compelling by the fact that

752
00:45:09,401 --> 00:45:13,060
there's a guy running around stealing
his name. He's benefited from it.

753
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:17,030
It's really crazy when you think
about it, you know, and I wonder if,

754
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:21,270
what the thinking of the time of it,
what was the,

755
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:25,210
when he probably first heard of this,
this rapper Rick Ross,

756
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:29,560
he probably didn't think it was
that huge deal. But then when it,

757
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:32,740
when Rick Ross becomes one of
the biggest rappers in the world,

758
00:45:32,741 --> 00:45:35,950
then suddenly that's,
that's a change during this part of it.

759
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:40,030
Or why would he always had been trying to
fight the, I think he always, you know,

760
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:43,690
names even when he came out of
jail, Rick Ross was famous. Yeah.

761
00:45:43,810 --> 00:45:47,540
He just wasn't as famous as he is now.
He's become really super. But yeah,

762
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:52,810
his book I'm sure wouldn't be
what it is if it wasn't for, well,

763
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:57,040
the story is amazing. The story
itself is amazing. I mean,

764
00:45:57,041 --> 00:45:59,380
he was a tennis standout in high school,

765
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,030
couldn't go to college
because he couldn't read.

766
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,310
So he was an athlete and was like
stranded in this terrible neighborhood.

767
00:46:06,311 --> 00:46:07,270
Didn't know what the fuck to do.

768
00:46:07,271 --> 00:46:11,590
So he started selling drugs and became
this giant truck dealer and he was making

769
00:46:11,591 --> 00:46:15,490
like some insane amounts of money,
millions of dollars a week. I mean,

770
00:46:15,491 --> 00:46:20,491
he was just making just stupid money
and it was all being funneled to the,

771
00:46:20,870 --> 00:46:22,420
the United States law,

772
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:27,020
all these covert operations overseas and
in Nicaragua, it's crazy. I mean, it was,

773
00:46:27,021 --> 00:46:31,250
uh, the whole Oliver Stone
of the whole, um, uh, uh,

774
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:35,830
Reagan Contra Fair. And, um, the fuck's
his name? Oliver. What's his name?

775
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:39,910
Stone. No, the all over north. Thank you.

776
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,710
The Oliver North situation,

777
00:46:41,711 --> 00:46:44,980
these guys on trial in front
of the fucking tired country.

778
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:47,740
No one's ever seen that shit
before. You know, and Reagan,

779
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:51,350
they're asking him if he sold
arms to through other, other,

780
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:56,400
other countries and shit. This was all
like part of that same era, you know,

781
00:46:56,410 --> 00:46:58,780
the same era of all this
crazy shit going on. The,

782
00:46:58,781 --> 00:47:00,490
we're finding out the
government's involved with him.

783
00:47:00,491 --> 00:47:05,290
One of the things was selling drugs
in the Los Angeles neighborhoods,

784
00:47:05,291 --> 00:47:09,970
the poor neighborhoods, and taking that
money like the CIA was selling drugs.

785
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,020
And our late great friend Michael
Rupert who passed away recently,

786
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:15,191
Michael Rupert,

787
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:19,570
who was a narcotics investigator for
the Los Angeles Police Department,

788
00:47:19,571 --> 00:47:22,020
he uncovered that Shit. They did that. Um,

789
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:25,600
that thing where he stood out in
front of that a press conference.

790
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:29,080
They have this press conference and he,
he yells out like in,

791
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:33,370
in the middle of this conference
that he, that they, he,

792
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,530
he knows that the CIA has been selling
drugs in Los Angeles communities and that

793
00:47:37,531 --> 00:47:40,930
he's caught them.
I mean this guy says this crazy on,

794
00:47:40,990 --> 00:47:44,410
on television and the whole,
the whole crowd failed with black people.

795
00:47:44,411 --> 00:47:45,370
They start cheering,

796
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:50,380
they're all excited about it and it's
like he's just standing up and like what a

797
00:47:50,381 --> 00:47:51,850
fucking crazy perky was.

798
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,070
Yeah.
We've been following the latest,

799
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:57,790
you know what the anonymous
and the whole shooting of that

800
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,970
kid, the other kid in St Louis. Yeah.
That's all ugly, man. That's ugly.

801
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,870
The Qin Saint Louis is ugly and there
was the other kid in the Walmart that are

802
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:11,270
the fake gun. Yeah. Just like what
the fuck is going on man. You know,

803
00:48:11,271 --> 00:48:14,270
there's an old expression,
but it's a really valid one.

804
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:19,070
Is that when the only tool you have is
a hammer? Everything looks like a nail.

805
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:20,413
Yeah.
Yeah.

806
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:25,510
And that's the problem with this
society that we have when people,

807
00:48:26,120 --> 00:48:26,361
you know,

808
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:30,680
you give them guns and you put them in
situations where if they make a bad call,

809
00:48:30,681 --> 00:48:35,480
someone dies. You know, if they
make a bad call, they freak out.

810
00:48:35,481 --> 00:48:36,650
Someone dies.
A huge

811
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:41,200
of difference to have that they have
that on you and yeah, as an option.

812
00:48:41,380 --> 00:48:45,070
But it's also like I don't know what the
options are because if you take their

813
00:48:45,071 --> 00:48:48,760
guns away from them and then ask them to
enforce crime in a place where a lot of

814
00:48:48,761 --> 00:48:52,120
people have guns,
boy is that even feasible?

815
00:48:52,121 --> 00:48:55,050
It's like disarmament seems like the,

816
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:57,880
the choice that liked to really
cautious people would choose. Like we,

817
00:48:57,881 --> 00:49:01,120
everyone needs to just give up their
guns but that's never going to happen.

818
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:05,530
Like people have to accept the fact that
there's always going to be people that

819
00:49:05,531 --> 00:49:08,620
keep illegal guns if anybody
tries to do that and they'll be,

820
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,220
they'll be doing it with
in their mind the full

821
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:16,550
approval of the constitution.
The second day Australia,

822
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,600
like when they've got rid of change all
their gun laws and got rid of guns and

823
00:49:20,601 --> 00:49:25,601
it was seen as it couldn't work and they
have not really had any incidents since

824
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:28,490
they've changed their downloads because
they used to be exactly the same as

825
00:49:28,491 --> 00:49:31,340
America.
I don't know all the statistics on it,

826
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:36,100
but I used to be the same as American
and they had one really bad major July,

827
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:39,050
ah,
ash shooting a shoe in and um,

828
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:42,740
they changed their gun
laws as a trial thing,

829
00:49:42,741 --> 00:49:45,800
I think in this particular state or area.

830
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:50,150
And it's maintained and it's worked again,

831
00:49:50,151 --> 00:49:51,950
that all the same thing that people said,
you cut it,

832
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,110
you can't take people's guns away.

833
00:49:54,111 --> 00:49:56,990
People and they did are
people protesting against it.

834
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:59,450
But then a year on kind of everyone's,

835
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,860
the problem is I think you trust your
government a lot more than we trust ours

836
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:07,860
because our government likes
starting wars. Yeah. Yeah.

837
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,420
And our government as a history
of not being honest with us,

838
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:15,840
our government has a history of
trying to suppress us. And physically,

839
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:21,280
I mean it seems for every on a yearly
basis for every huge story there is a

840
00:50:22,071 --> 00:50:24,400
member of the public going
out and killing people doing,

841
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:28,130
there's then a police story of as well.
So it kind of

842
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,170
fuels them both. I was tweeting
that whole thing of where we are.

843
00:50:32,210 --> 00:50:36,260
If we don't trust the police then we need
to be armed and then place exactly the

844
00:50:36,261 --> 00:50:39,530
same as you've said, if they are police
in an area where everyone's got guns,

845
00:50:39,531 --> 00:50:40,910
it's kind of,
yeah,

846
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,160
people need to come to an agreement
and that's not going to happen.

847
00:50:43,190 --> 00:50:44,390
While it's also a problem,
when you,

848
00:50:44,420 --> 00:50:48,620
whenever you have a group of people
that become sort of responsible for the

849
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:50,390
actions of an individual,
right?

850
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:54,830
If you have a hundred cops in one cop
does something really fucked up than cops

851
00:50:54,831 --> 00:50:56,030
are pigs,
you know,

852
00:50:56,031 --> 00:51:00,530
and all these other cops get lumped into
this one group instead of it being an

853
00:51:00,531 --> 00:51:03,410
individual that was in a position of
power that did something fucked up.

854
00:51:03,411 --> 00:51:07,460
It's the cops. So then it's
the cops versus the people.
Yeah. And that's madness.

855
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,630
You know,
it's all madness.

856
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:13,070
The Guy who shot that kid for
sure is a piece of shit. You know,

857
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:16,070
he fucked Diane. That cops in general.
Yeah. It doesn't mean, I mean I'm,

858
00:51:16,071 --> 00:51:17,720
who knows what's going on
through this guy's head.

859
00:51:17,721 --> 00:51:22,140
The other thing about these guys, a lot
of them have PTSD. They have like we,

860
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,341
you know,

861
00:51:22,341 --> 00:51:26,240
you talk about PTSD for people that go
away and they fight in wars and then come

862
00:51:26,241 --> 00:51:29,390
back. While a lot of those guys that
do that become cops, first of all,

863
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:31,790
when they come back,
it's a good gig for soldier.

864
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:33,200
You've already used to being in the shit.

865
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:36,140
It's probably mild in comparison
to what you've seen and you know,

866
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:38,150
I could probably handle stress
better than the average person.

867
00:51:38,151 --> 00:51:39,870
It's like if you look at for a Gig,
it's probably the,

868
00:51:39,871 --> 00:51:44,250
it's going to make you more comfortable
pulling your gun as well. Right.

869
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,970
That's true too. And you
know, you also used to,

870
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,580
I mean especially if
you had to have active,

871
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,130
you've actually been in combat and
if you've been in combat, you've,

872
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,500
you've definitely shot people.

873
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,450
If you'd definitely shop people
to be easier to shoot somebody.

874
00:51:56,451 --> 00:51:58,910
Again and you also probably your senses,

875
00:51:58,911 --> 00:52:03,320
your whole sense of like what's on
the line would probably be much,

876
00:52:03,650 --> 00:52:07,700
much more like sharp than a person
that's never seen people killed.

877
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:10,280
Like you're right, you're like
this could happen at any second.

878
00:52:10,281 --> 00:52:11,960
You better stop this before it happens.

879
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:16,730
You have like a much shorter like line of
bullshit that you'll tolerate and this,

880
00:52:16,731 --> 00:52:19,700
you know, that's if you're in
a war zone as to be expected,

881
00:52:19,701 --> 00:52:24,260
but that war zone becomes a streets if
you have the same attitude and your deal,

882
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,180
but it's just going to happen that way.

883
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:30,170
When you have people and they hate each
other and there's a group here and a

884
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:33,740
group there that comps in the citizens
and you have a situation like this,

885
00:52:33,770 --> 00:52:35,630
things will be flared up for years now.

886
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,920
It's annoying how it has to be such a
group thing and these people against or

887
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,880
they use people. There was a song out
about two years ago now, it's the kind of,

888
00:52:43,970 --> 00:52:48,970
just before the Trayvon
Martin stuff happened and it
was called film the police.

889
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:53,090
And it was a rewrite of Nwa funded police.
And it was just caught in everyone to,

890
00:52:53,690 --> 00:52:56,570
but we've all got phones now it's
saying, right, the police are placeness,

891
00:52:56,571 --> 00:52:59,840
but there's issues.
So rather than being less,

892
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:04,340
rather than being a fucked up place,
being just make sure you me filming stuff.

893
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:07,960
And it was just a huge backlash from
people in support with the police saying,

894
00:53:07,961 --> 00:53:09,170
no, this isn't fair. And it's like, well,

895
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:13,910
it's not saying that film the police
and catch them all out to shit.

896
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:17,180
It's like the good ones won't be
doing anything bad. So it's not,

897
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,750
it's not a negative thing,
you know? But if you're,

898
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,680
if you're using more or watching
the watchman as it a kind of thing,

899
00:53:25,681 --> 00:53:26,490
then it

900
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:28,590
starts to then police itself.
And hopefully,

901
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:32,430
I don't think there's anything wrong
with the idea of filming police. Nah.

902
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:35,850
And I think there's also a lot of evidence
that when police are forced to wear

903
00:53:35,851 --> 00:53:38,410
cameras that film all their
actions, they're the, there's a,

904
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:42,690
the thing about the hemorrhoid. Yeah. The
uh, allegations of abuse dropped by 80%.

905
00:53:42,691 --> 00:53:43,110
Yeah.

906
00:53:43,110 --> 00:53:47,610
And someone actually said this the years
because people can't claim fake abuse.

907
00:53:47,611 --> 00:53:49,620
Now, if somebody actually said
it to me on Twitter, I'm like,

908
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:53,520
or cops know that they can fucking do,

909
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:57,900
do shit because you're wearing a camera.
It's great. Again, I mean cops are people,

910
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:00,000
there's good ones and bad
ones lately in the UK.

911
00:54:00,950 --> 00:54:05,940
Are you realize now that it was a time
when the cops were the best of the best,

912
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:08,700
but that's not the case anymore.
There's, there's a variation.

913
00:54:08,701 --> 00:54:12,270
There's some people who are genuinely
good citizens trying to make the change,

914
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,680
but I knew people who,

915
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:18,900
who worked with me in the record store
and didn't get kept on and became a

916
00:54:18,901 --> 00:54:20,100
policeman instead,
sorry,

917
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:25,720
you couldn't do retail and now your
police in the streets kind of illness as

918
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:26,250
crazy.

919
00:54:26,250 --> 00:54:30,600
That's not as not the best of the best
that he should or was being police should

920
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:32,640
be like being the night's watch.
Yeah.

921
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:35,460
It should really be like you're
the guy whose garden, the, the,

922
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,450
the top of the wall. I mean, that's really
what it should be like. It's like, yeah,

923
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,340
she'd be a revered position of noble
people, you know, martial artists,

924
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:48,700
people who are, you know, they actually
want to do good, have a coding safe,

925
00:54:49,290 --> 00:54:50,420
uh, politicians. Now,

926
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:54,230
like we all complained about how older
politicians are kind of scumbags.

927
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:57,380
It's like, cause he's not appealing job
like normal people like us wouldn't,

928
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:01,100
there's no appeal in being a fucking
politician because you're imagining how it

929
00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:03,660
would be the mayor or something.
They said pip, it's your time.

930
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:06,780
It's the worst nightmare.
That shift that was like the draft.

931
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:10,260
Like you just get it drafted to be a
fucking mayor. Like out of nowhere,

932
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,560
we would like your lyrics. You're going
to be the mayor now. You're like, what?

933
00:55:13,561 --> 00:55:15,870
And they fucking show up at
your door with accountants.

934
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:19,230
You got to go over the budget, like how
much you wanna spend on medication. What,

935
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,220
how much you wanna spend
on the government? What is
scratch one spend on sewage,

936
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:28,020
what span tillage? And we got a water
bill. We all Colorado, what? Yeah,

937
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:31,590
fuck all that man. And that's the problem
because everybody says fuck all that.

938
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:34,920
And the only people that don't say fuck
all that are the ones who could make

939
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:39,870
some money from it or can be or hopefully
are really dedicated to trying to help

940
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:43,920
people. You'll hope but good fucking
luck. Good luck with all that.

941
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,590
Especially in this day and age,

942
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,450
we're going to need some
dust to settle the semester.

943
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:53,340
I mean it's just with the whole
politics thing you need to know,

944
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:57,240
I kind of argue with people on online
about this all the time because I think

945
00:55:57,241 --> 00:56:02,130
the way your democracy is currently set
up and that the democracy is currently

946
00:56:02,131 --> 00:56:02,850
set up,

947
00:56:02,850 --> 00:56:06,420
there's no chance of any real change
like anytime soon because it's a gradual,

948
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:09,360
it's slight changes either way,
but nothing else is discussed.

949
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:12,750
We need to protect the ideals of
democracy and it's like, well,

950
00:56:13,950 --> 00:56:16,290
why? Yeah, I think
there's, I mean there's,

951
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,950
I'm going completely
off on tangent nowadays.

952
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:25,120
There's hundreds of different kinds of
ocracy kinds of ways to run a society.

953
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,960
Number one add democracies
we've got aren't real
democracies, right? They kind of,

954
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:31,990
it's the two party system and all
this coming. So it's not a real,

955
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:35,590
we just vote and that's who gets in and
they're often being funded by the same

956
00:56:35,591 --> 00:56:38,770
company. Exactly. It's the
same. Incredibly ridiculous.
And there's loads of,

957
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:42,730
I mean I was just discussing recently
and it pisses people off because it kind

958
00:56:42,731 --> 00:56:45,190
of shows a level of elite isn't
that people are scared of,

959
00:56:45,191 --> 00:56:49,300
but I think going on stuff based on,
on a Marriott,

960
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,800
Chrissy and stuff like that where say
your vote would be worth more than the guy

961
00:56:54,140 --> 00:56:54,730
who,

962
00:56:54,730 --> 00:56:59,730
who is sitting at home in a trailer and
doesn't know anything about politics.

963
00:56:59,950 --> 00:57:04,090
But that good though that's kind of
dangerous from one person's vote is worth

964
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,650
more than another. It's, it's
measured. So for example,

965
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,790
my theory on it being if when you go to
vote there's a short questionnaire on

966
00:57:12,791 --> 00:57:15,460
politics or on social
on society or something.

967
00:57:15,730 --> 00:57:20,470
And that ranks or what you wear, but isn't
that subjective? I mean, first of all,

968
00:57:20,471 --> 00:57:23,920
there's just information like you
could have information about politics.

969
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,470
That's one thing. Like you know,
when was Eleanor Roosevelt,

970
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,480
this one was on policies,

971
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:31,240
on policies and and what's what's
actually valid at the moment.

972
00:57:31,241 --> 00:57:36,220
Because then even if people than just
bone up on it to try and cheat the system.

973
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:38,710
That's good. They're reading
about what the policies are.

974
00:57:38,711 --> 00:57:42,070
They learning it rather than just going
and taking the box that they're family

975
00:57:42,071 --> 00:57:44,470
have always supported Republicans.
Therefore that's that.

976
00:57:44,580 --> 00:57:49,180
That's forcing people to have some level
of education in it to make their vote

977
00:57:49,181 --> 00:57:50,440
worth more.
Yeah.

978
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:55,441
Maybe I'm hanging on to the idea that
everyone should have an equal vote and

979
00:57:55,731 --> 00:57:59,920
that it shouldn't be like an earned thing
and you earn it by having an education

980
00:57:59,921 --> 00:58:01,540
about the system.
And there's a great quote,

981
00:58:02,350 --> 00:58:06,490
great quote that says we're not
all entitled to our own opinion.

982
00:58:06,491 --> 00:58:09,850
We're all into our auto, our own informed
opinion. Because again, everyone quotes,

983
00:58:09,851 --> 00:58:12,190
I think I'm entitled to
my opinion said, well, no.

984
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:16,000
If someone's done more research
on it and knows about it,

985
00:58:16,001 --> 00:58:19,150
then there's, there is right and
wrong. You can't just say, okay,

986
00:58:19,151 --> 00:58:23,830
well in my opinion I'm entitled
to it. On a lionfish is, yeah,

987
00:58:23,890 --> 00:58:25,300
there's some issues where it's not.

988
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,580
There's some issues where it's
just a subjective judgment.

989
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:30,370
One person would agree,
one person would disagree,

990
00:58:30,371 --> 00:58:31,960
like there's certain issues
that people are very,

991
00:58:31,961 --> 00:58:36,460
very passionate about that you have polar
opposite people absolutely dedicated

992
00:58:36,461 --> 00:58:39,250
to their opinion and won't budge. Yeah,
like abortion, that's a great thing,

993
00:58:39,251 --> 00:58:41,620
but then it's an informed
opinion is not just a kind of,

994
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,990
sometimes not even though sometimes
there's not an informed opinion.

995
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,420
Sometimes people just get on
a side and that's their side.

996
00:58:50,620 --> 00:58:54,730
Stuck on that side can get crazy,
but that's people.

997
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:57,850
That's a super common thing.
That's a super common thing.

998
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:02,470
Like take on republican talking points
or take on liberal talking points.

999
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,290
Really Common or oh,
the bibles that,

1000
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,940
the key example of that where people
are just blindly, we'll vast fast.

1001
00:59:09,010 --> 00:59:13,990
That's my belief and therefore I will
fight any arguments against it despite any

1002
00:59:13,991 --> 00:59:18,970
logic and theories and yeah, in
reality. Yeah, that's a big one.

1003
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,250
That's a common one because you know,
that's one

1004
00:59:22,250 --> 00:59:26,330
that has been used for so many years for
so many people and it's become just a

1005
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:30,750
oh well paved path that
everybody could walk on.

1006
00:59:30,751 --> 00:59:34,570
It's a great structure and set
up our first song that, um,

1007
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:39,670
got vehicle at when I was working with
regard done a sac was called are always

1008
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:41,960
Kale when it was just a
rewrite of commandments.

1009
00:59:41,961 --> 00:59:44,630
It was a load of commandments for now.
And I'm not religious,

1010
00:59:44,631 --> 00:59:48,740
but the reason I think it hit through
with people is this a simple structure

1011
00:59:48,741 --> 00:59:51,530
that you all know and are familiar with,
but,

1012
00:59:51,810 --> 00:59:56,330
and that's why it works for religion as
well as in a spoken word hip hop song.

1013
00:59:56,331 --> 00:59:59,750
It's kind of is that simplicity of, you
know, the stories and the structures,

1014
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,650
therefore you can get a point
across that isn't about religion,

1015
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:08,630
but by using those,
that's more about society and people,

1016
01:00:08,810 --> 01:00:13,810
but using that template of what
religious people have laid down for us.

1017
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:14,961
Yeah.

1018
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:19,490
What religious people of rate laid down
and you know the variance in like how

1019
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:23,810
much they vary from one to the next.
Like how much Judaism varies from Islam.

1020
01:00:23,811 --> 01:00:25,970
Various can Christianity,
how much they borrow from each other.

1021
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:27,980
Like some of these wrong,
somebody's wrong.

1022
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,460
Well let's just break down like
what you guys are actually what,

1023
01:00:31,480 --> 01:00:32,810
what are we supporting here?

1024
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,070
And we supporting the idea that there
is a guy and this guy watches over

1025
01:00:37,071 --> 01:00:38,110
everything and he made everything.

1026
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:42,500
He's allowing all this crazy chaos and
he told us once a few thousand years ago

1027
01:00:42,501 --> 01:00:43,430
how to live your life.

1028
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,430
And if you don't pay attention to
what the fuck he said back then,

1029
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:50,990
you're on your own. And so you're
forced to be led by a bunch of people.

1030
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:53,930
He sees these people, he sees they're
hypocritical actions, he does nothing.

1031
01:00:53,931 --> 01:00:58,190
He allows them to distort his message
and relay it in its most fucked up way.

1032
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:00,770
That's ruining the earth itself.
And still,

1033
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:03,890
he doesn't come down and correct anybody
like this is what you're saying. Yeah.

1034
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,870
That's crazy.
Are you sure?

1035
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:09,680
Or is this puzzle far too
complex for our brains?

1036
01:01:09,681 --> 01:01:12,380
Is this like an ant trying
to understand a satellite?

1037
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:14,900
Because if you try to get an
aunt to understand a satellite,

1038
01:01:14,901 --> 01:01:17,610
it's outside of his realm
of comprehension lately.

1039
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:21,650
And I think we have a realm
of comprehension, whether
we like to admit it or not.

1040
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,920
And I think the very nature
of the universe itself is
currently outside of our

1041
01:01:27,231 --> 01:01:28,520
realm of comprehension,

1042
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:32,120
or at least the realm of comprehension
of the average person. Me included.

1043
01:01:32,820 --> 01:01:37,820
Phife has gotta be the most
dangerous word ever made. But that's,

1044
01:01:37,821 --> 01:01:41,000
that's the thing that the argument
would, where do I say, well, you know,

1045
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,600
we were left here and we've got to have
faith that God's going to do this and do

1046
01:01:44,601 --> 01:01:47,030
that. And it's all, all
tests. But I've got my faith.

1047
01:01:47,031 --> 01:01:51,440
It's like that's a massive get out clause
for any argument of, well, we've never,

1048
01:01:51,441 --> 01:01:55,880
you can't see this person. You can't
prove. And it not only can not prove it,

1049
01:01:55,881 --> 01:02:00,881
but you're having faith in something
that looks very much like bullshit.

1050
01:02:01,330 --> 01:02:05,210
Yeah. You know, if you look the stories
you read, the guy came back from the dead,

1051
01:02:05,211 --> 01:02:07,820
he was dead for three days and then he
pushed her rock side and came back. Okay.

1052
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,440
Oh yeah. All right. I believe
that. Okay, this is Adam and Eve's.

1053
01:02:11,450 --> 01:02:13,750
There's two people and then
they fucked and what happens?

1054
01:02:13,770 --> 01:02:18,310
They have kids and then time
though, right? Kids accepted.

1055
01:02:18,350 --> 01:02:23,340
Cause everyone kind of jokes now
and mocks Scientology cause of the

1056
01:02:23,341 --> 01:02:27,960
ludicrousness of loads of, of what they
say. But it's ludicrous because it's new.

1057
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:30,240
If it was thousands of years old,

1058
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:33,660
then people would be the same with
Christianity and just kind of go, well,

1059
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,670
you know,
it is kind of ludicrous,

1060
01:02:35,671 --> 01:02:39,940
but [inaudible] Christianity's ludicrous.
Yeah.

1061
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,720
Have you have conversations with
hardcore Christians about whether or not

1062
01:02:42,721 --> 01:02:45,940
Christianity's ludicrous know, argue
with you while why it's not? Yeah,

1063
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,290
and what the story's really represent
and how the message of God comes through

1064
01:02:49,291 --> 01:02:51,500
these stories. Like I think
he's crazy, but there's,

1065
01:02:51,690 --> 01:02:53,550
there's such a mixture as well in there.

1066
01:02:53,551 --> 01:02:55,790
The study will be loads
of questions that no,

1067
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:57,600
that all that stuff is kind of bullshit,

1068
01:02:57,601 --> 01:03:01,630
but they believe what they believe
and they believe their genomic,

1069
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,710
that they are just stories and all this
kind of thing. So it's, well there's also,

1070
01:03:04,711 --> 01:03:08,380
he's a levels within
your own belief system.

1071
01:03:08,381 --> 01:03:12,240
There's such a variation as people who
would sit here now and go yam if less

1072
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:15,810
fucking crazy.
But that devout Christians and yeah,

1073
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:20,190
there's people that just believe in God
and they feel like the Bible is sort of

1074
01:03:20,191 --> 01:03:24,870
a framework for good behavior that was
laid down by this holy entity at one

1075
01:03:24,871 --> 01:03:25,710
point in the past.

1076
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:30,780
And that although the stories had been
twisted and weird and you know that a lot

1077
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:34,350
of these stories,
they probably represented something,

1078
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:38,520
something important a long time ago.
And so you're getting these,

1079
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:42,870
this connection to God like through a
game of me in that game of telephone or if

1080
01:03:42,871 --> 01:03:45,110
you played it in England but you,

1081
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:47,910
you would tell a friend something and
then he would tell friends something that

1082
01:03:47,911 --> 01:03:50,470
he would tell friends.
By the time it got down to Brian,

1083
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,580
I can tell you the story was dog shit.
It was all fucked up.

1084
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:58,880
And I think that the idea is that in
the UK it was called Chinese whispers,

1085
01:03:59,761 --> 01:04:03,120
which sounds incredibly racist,
but that's what it was.

1086
01:04:03,121 --> 01:04:04,560
It was called Chinese whispers.
It wasn't,

1087
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:09,090
that's that game anyway at telephone is
a far better name for it and let's stick

1088
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:09,331
with that.

1089
01:04:09,331 --> 01:04:13,860
But that whole idea is that at the end
of that is God at the end of that has god

1090
01:04:13,890 --> 01:04:18,180
and yeah, the story got mucked up,
but the, the story did get fucked up.

1091
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:21,420
But that story has a
direct connection to God.

1092
01:04:21,421 --> 01:04:24,570
And the way that grunt direct connection
works is that at one point in time

1093
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:25,560
there was,

1094
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:30,560
there was something where someone was
explained the very nature of the universe

1095
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,890
and then whether it's
through psychedelic drugs,

1096
01:04:34,891 --> 01:04:38,280
whether it was through an actual
religious experience with a divine entity.

1097
01:04:38,490 --> 01:04:42,270
And then from that point, what happened
is that person told another person,

1098
01:04:42,271 --> 01:04:47,190
that person told another person they did
their best to remember everything that

1099
01:04:47,191 --> 01:04:51,180
the people before them told them. But
if you got through all that goofy Shit,

1100
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:54,440
all that Adam and eve stuff and all
that fucking, although the, the,

1101
01:04:54,441 --> 01:04:59,370
the more weird and ridiculous and
preposterous stories in any religion,

1102
01:04:59,371 --> 01:05:03,030
if you got through all that
and went back to the source,

1103
01:05:03,330 --> 01:05:07,110
you almost are still connected
in some sort of a weird,

1104
01:05:07,111 --> 01:05:09,930
bizarre and maybe like a,
um,

1105
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:16,250
like an all like almost like
a mathematical way you're
connected to the original

1106
01:05:16,351 --> 01:05:18,070
story. Yeah. You know, the, his original

1107
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:21,460
story, the original story turns
into this, his memory fucks it up.

1108
01:05:21,461 --> 01:05:23,630
It turns into that. Like, is
it correct at the end? Yeah,

1109
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:26,460
no translations as well though.
The trend line is,

1110
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:30,600
was all written in a language that is
dead and people to very trans language,

1111
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:35,040
things like that. And it's like, whoa.
Well there's two of them too far away from

1112
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:35,611
does the,

1113
01:05:35,611 --> 01:05:40,611
the oldest version that they found is the
stuff that's in Qumran that's the Dead

1114
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:43,680
Sea Scrolls. Yeah. Though the, some of
the same stores that are in the Bible,

1115
01:05:43,681 --> 01:05:46,940
so these are the oldest versions
by like a thousand years.

1116
01:05:47,370 --> 01:05:50,040
And I think they're the only
ones that are in Aramaic.

1117
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:54,600
It's an Aramaic and it's written on
animal skins. Yeah, it's fucking crazy.

1118
01:05:54,780 --> 01:05:57,810
They piece together to Dead
Sea scrolls with and a,

1119
01:05:58,050 --> 01:06:01,350
they made sure that they got the DNA of
the same cow so they knew if this the

1120
01:06:01,351 --> 01:06:02,184
same cow,

1121
01:06:02,340 --> 01:06:05,250
it most likely was the same piece of
paper because they were all different

1122
01:06:05,251 --> 01:06:08,520
counties and different pieces of paper
and they had to figure out like which,

1123
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:12,510
which animal skins cause all these crumbs
and pieces and they had a piece them

1124
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:16,260
together over decades.
Man. Just, it's craziness.

1125
01:06:16,261 --> 01:06:20,900
Madness and that is what all the
faith and belief so based on,

1126
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,820
and they just really in this shit man,
it wasn't like

1127
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:28,240
1947 again, there's that old, I think
it was in a TV series in the UK.

1128
01:06:28,241 --> 01:06:29,620
There was as a joke thing,

1129
01:06:29,621 --> 01:06:34,510
have they found the original first
page of the Bible just saying that um,

1130
01:06:35,170 --> 01:06:38,980
any resemblance to people in real life
is purely coincidental and so on and so

1131
01:06:38,981 --> 01:06:43,330
forth from that. It's just a book
of fiction and some found out thing.

1132
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:46,250
Yeah. In my, the best
version of the world.

1133
01:06:46,251 --> 01:06:49,370
It would be that you get to the end
of the Bible and it just says psych.

1134
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:50,560
We were on mushrooms.

1135
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:55,680
That would be the best version
before bear left. David Copperfield.

1136
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,370
I ate it all up.
Yeah.

1137
01:06:58,371 --> 01:07:03,371
1946 I collection of 981
texts was discovered,

1138
01:07:03,910 --> 01:07:04,070
uh,

1139
01:07:04,070 --> 01:07:09,070
between 46 and 56 took some 10 years in
this area in the West Bank called Qumran

1140
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:15,130
and they were found inside caves about
a mile inland north of the North West

1141
01:07:15,171 --> 01:07:18,680
shore of the Dead Sea and
really interesting shit, man.

1142
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:23,360
Nine or the scrolls were rediscovered
at the Israeli antiquities authority in

1143
01:07:23,361 --> 01:07:28,361
2014 after they'd had been stored
unopened for six decades following their

1144
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:32,480
excavation in 1952 the texts
are of great historical,

1145
01:07:32,481 --> 01:07:35,900
religious and linguistic significance
because they include the earliest known

1146
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:41,110
surviving manuscripts of works later
included in the Hebrew Bible Canon along

1147
01:07:41,511 --> 01:07:46,511
with due to rada bow doodle raw cononical
Deuteronomy due to Ra Deuteronomy.

1148
01:07:50,110 --> 01:07:53,720
Me
Too.

1149
01:07:54,130 --> 01:07:58,480
Sure. Oh, you know, this is how like my
wife is saying this to me the other day.

1150
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:01,720
It's interesting when you're raising
kids and you're teaching them how to say

1151
01:08:01,721 --> 01:08:05,590
words and you know you have to spell it
and you, you see how it's difficult. Well,

1152
01:08:05,591 --> 01:08:08,020
when you learn a new word like this,

1153
01:08:08,021 --> 01:08:12,250
like you know Deuteronomy,
I could just say it and it would be easy,

1154
01:08:12,430 --> 01:08:15,980
but I'm trying to figure it out
as I'm saying like a little kid,

1155
01:08:15,981 --> 01:08:19,430
like that's kind of never
goes away due to row.

1156
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:24,290
Can Non Nicole do the row canonical
and extra biblical manuscripts which

1157
01:08:24,291 --> 01:08:28,730
preserve the evidence of the diversity
of religious thought in the late Second

1158
01:08:28,731 --> 01:08:33,120
Temple Judaism. Interesting.
Interesting. Interesting stuff man. Yeah.

1159
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:38,450
From 408 BCE and 318 BCE.

1160
01:08:39,530 --> 01:08:40,940
Man,
they don't really know though.

1161
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:44,540
It's crazy that it's just that the barbell
is just a collection of stories and

1162
01:08:44,541 --> 01:08:49,430
not one Johnny wasn't written
as one thing. You kind of
think of it as the Bible,

1163
01:08:49,431 --> 01:08:51,650
but sign that pops of the stuff on the,

1164
01:08:51,770 --> 01:08:54,330
on the Dead Sea scrolls were
stories included in the Bible.

1165
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:58,240
Yeah. Yes. Just pick 400 shoes. Bce.

1166
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,680
Wonder what the oldest known. That's
the, um, the old, that's the range. The,

1167
01:09:03,700 --> 01:09:06,620
so the oldest one,
they found 400 APC.

1168
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:11,060
I wonder what the oldest version of the
Hebrew Bible is. If you had to guess

1169
01:09:13,010 --> 01:09:16,700
40 years, shut up, bitch. This
ridiculous. What do you think?

1170
01:09:16,701 --> 01:09:21,701
Like the oldest version of the
Hebrew Bible clue 3000 years.

1171
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,201
Cause I,

1172
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,500
I'm at assumed that actually the Dead
Sea scrolls were from earlier than that.

1173
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:32,330
I'd read some something that must've
been incorrect that said it was a older

1174
01:09:32,331 --> 01:09:36,520
than that. Okay. The oldest
surviving Hebrew manuscript,

1175
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:40,640
including the Dead Sea Scrolls,
second century BCE. Well,

1176
01:09:40,641 --> 01:09:44,450
this is a gift Wikipedia and it's given
me a different date because they were

1177
01:09:44,451 --> 01:09:47,870
saying for like four oh eight.
Right? Was that what the uh, the,

1178
01:09:48,090 --> 01:09:52,790
the longest version. Uh, so
that is like the oldest version.

1179
01:09:52,830 --> 01:09:56,330
That's the oldest version of the Hebrew
Bible or the oldest oldest version of

1180
01:09:56,331 --> 01:10:00,770
the stories that are in
the habit. Yeah. Amazing.

1181
01:10:01,160 --> 01:10:04,400
Imagine if you can go back to those dudes
who wrote the Bible way back then and

1182
01:10:04,401 --> 01:10:08,450
you could bring them in a time machine
to 2014 and show them like they're the

1183
01:10:08,451 --> 01:10:10,460
havoc that they've created.
Have them explain. Yeah.

1184
01:10:10,461 --> 01:10:14,810
What was that makes the whole page out
there that had been tweak it a little?

1185
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,440
Well, it's so weird that it's, it gets
translated into different languages.

1186
01:10:18,441 --> 01:10:21,220
Like have you ever done one
of those things where you
take Russian and translate

1187
01:10:21,221 --> 01:10:23,810
it to English and you try to like
explain what the fuck they mean?

1188
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:27,950
Their language is so different than ours
that it always comes out like he gives

1189
01:10:27,951 --> 01:10:32,530
to country but fails not yet.
You know,

1190
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:37,040
there's like, there's a
weird weird interpretation
of, of languages to English.

1191
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:40,220
So you gotta think you're going from
a weird language like ancient Hebrew,

1192
01:10:40,490 --> 01:10:44,840
which was, um, the, these
to have, like their numbers
were embedded in their words.

1193
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,030
So like there was no,
there's no number.

1194
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:49,460
What if it just started off as means?
Like whatever.

1195
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,050
Just going back to how the Bible,
you know,

1196
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:53,990
the language back then
actually was just like,

1197
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:57,390
we all talk like a mean back
then like I like you just said,

1198
01:10:57,391 --> 01:11:00,640
that sounds like a meme.
Almost like I go back home knee,

1199
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,980
I'm saying no, no, no, no,
that's not the Bible. You know,

1200
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:05,980
you're paying attention when I said
that's like if you take Russian and

1201
01:11:05,981 --> 01:11:10,570
interpreted to English. Right. That's
not what I'm saying. Um, the, the,

1202
01:11:10,571 --> 01:11:13,770
the um, just the ancient
languages, like when they try that,

1203
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:18,771
I've got that translation and the original
thing they read in is just so old and

1204
01:11:18,991 --> 01:11:23,940
they're using DNA to kind of pace in the
right order and all that kind of thing.

1205
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:28,680
It's mostly guessing, right? Well, no,
not really guessing, you know, I mean,

1206
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:31,230
these fit,
there's definitely pieces missing,

1207
01:11:31,470 --> 01:11:35,580
but when they have stories that are like,
when they translate,

1208
01:11:35,581 --> 01:11:39,660
part of the story in the story is like
very similar to like book of Genesis or

1209
01:11:39,661 --> 01:11:40,590
something along those lines.

1210
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:44,160
They could sort of make those correlations
if they have enough similarities.

1211
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:47,040
But there's a lot of those
stories that are like, that man.

1212
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,260
Like that when you go
back to the oldest shit,

1213
01:11:49,261 --> 01:11:53,670
that cuneiform that the
Sumerians used to write in. Oh,

1214
01:11:53,671 --> 01:11:56,900
it's so weird looking man.
It's like these, these there,

1215
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,810
there was no like variation in the,
like the way their letters were,

1216
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,300
the letters were all
like these little wines.

1217
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:08,260
So they'd go down to like pull this
up like cuneiform ancients who?

1218
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:11,310
Marion. It's weird, weird shit man.

1219
01:12:11,550 --> 01:12:16,380
They would write in this Google
search his head. Same place. Yeah.

1220
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,340
It's um, it's cool just right.
Yeah. It's like, it would,

1221
01:12:20,341 --> 01:12:23,710
it looks like is like a wedge that you
would like to say with your trauma down a

1222
01:12:23,711 --> 01:12:25,870
trade at a stick. A wedge and
they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1223
01:12:25,980 --> 01:12:29,880
Like they're more like wedges than they
are. Like, it's not like a straight line.

1224
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:34,740
It's like there's a fat top and then it
goes down to a lower bottom and they say

1225
01:12:34,741 --> 01:12:39,090
this is how they wrote. Like look at
these things. How weird is that? Yeah,

1226
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:43,110
it's like all I know Jay's,
yeah, it's so, it's so weird.

1227
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,940
I mean it's sort of like,
um,

1228
01:12:44,970 --> 01:12:48,810
it's so hard to imagine
how different that is.

1229
01:12:48,811 --> 01:12:52,230
Keep that up so we could look at that
shit for a second. Look how weird that is.

1230
01:12:52,231 --> 01:12:56,430
Like that's the language and they write
these little columns and so much of it

1231
01:12:56,450 --> 01:13:01,450
just just to us look in exactly the
same look as similar shapes and sizes.

1232
01:13:01,621 --> 01:13:05,970
Hacking that of the intricacies of,
of a language. Yeah. If he's like,

1233
01:13:07,170 --> 01:13:09,120
if you looked at that,
that looks like dog shit.

1234
01:13:09,121 --> 01:13:12,300
Like if you had your whole life to
figure out what the fuck that means.

1235
01:13:13,170 --> 01:13:16,080
Good luck. He was never figure it
out. You'd never figure it out.

1236
01:13:16,650 --> 01:13:21,030
So it takes like a team of linguists
to pieces together and here's the crazy

1237
01:13:21,031 --> 01:13:23,480
shit. They don't even know
what the word sounded like.

1238
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:28,410
Like there's a bunch of words in ancient
Sumerians fucking guesswork. There was,

1239
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:33,650
there was a thing that someone had done
a where they had a recreated what they

1240
01:13:34,291 --> 01:13:36,810
believe ancient Sumerian sounded like,

1241
01:13:36,930 --> 01:13:40,590
but it's so dead that no one can
even talk it. Yeah, of course.

1242
01:13:40,591 --> 01:13:43,770
Like how can you even start
to see you how to pronounce

1243
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:49,260
the scratch ins that were on
that thing then? So weird. Well,

1244
01:13:49,261 --> 01:13:51,330
I don't know how they do it.
I don't know.

1245
01:13:51,540 --> 01:13:54,720
I know that they have like this is what
it looked like. This is the language.

1246
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,820
Yeah, I guess some of them,
oh, this is year by year.

1247
01:13:56,850 --> 01:14:00,510
Will escrow make that a little larger
so it gets hit as a year by year.

1248
01:14:00,511 --> 01:14:03,630
Like let's scroll down so you can get
to the top, to the top, to the top.

1249
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:07,320
We'll see 3,200 BC,
3000 BCE,

1250
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:10,190
and then you go all the way to the far
right and it's just all the lines are

1251
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:14,020
thousand. Yeah. Wow.
Those weird lines, man.

1252
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:19,060
That's interesting. So this was like
eight bit and this is like Xbox. They,

1253
01:14:19,061 --> 01:14:23,830
they pretty much updated it to a better
language. Have you ever white round?

1254
01:14:23,980 --> 01:14:28,070
Oh, other way, Ramey, right,
right. Yeah. Yeah. Well let's go.

1255
01:14:28,090 --> 01:14:29,760
I'll be be partly down to the,

1256
01:14:30,390 --> 01:14:34,170
the methods in which they were brought in.
If,

1257
01:14:34,240 --> 01:14:38,130
if they couldn't have done more intricate
stuff. If you're, you're scratching into

1258
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,710
clay,
into clay and stuff like that.

1259
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:45,800
They also would make these rollers that
would make these rollers and then they

1260
01:14:45,801 --> 01:14:46,910
would lay out clay.

1261
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:50,450
And they would roll the roller into
the clay and then baked the clay.

1262
01:14:51,110 --> 01:14:56,110
So like the roller itself would be
like a method of distributing like a

1263
01:14:57,321 --> 01:14:58,154
newspaper.

1264
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:01,610
Like you'd be able to roll that shit
and he'd put it in the clay and then you

1265
01:15:01,611 --> 01:15:04,010
could do several times. Yeah. Yeah.

1266
01:15:04,011 --> 01:15:07,970
So they had these weird things they
used to do to make these clay tablets.

1267
01:15:08,020 --> 01:15:12,220
So you kind of have to make the newspaper
yourself. Yes, I wear a gas. I mean,

1268
01:15:12,221 --> 01:15:13,750
I can remember hearing is,
it's crazy.

1269
01:15:13,751 --> 01:15:17,250
The first the first adverts ever made were

1270
01:15:18,880 --> 01:15:23,880
musical notes and that printed on the
product you bought and you had to sing the

1271
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:28,990
advert yourselves as the
first ever jingles Rhea
cigarette pack per pack packets

1272
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:32,160
and that. But in those
days, um, because yeah,

1273
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:34,270
there wasn't any radio and
stuff like that and it,

1274
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:38,260
in those days everyone kind of had a piano
or could, could, could play his shit.

1275
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:39,610
And yeah, the first ever, uh,

1276
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:43,540
jingles were printed and written out and
people would sit around the piano and

1277
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,540
play the,
the camel cigars.

1278
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:50,680
Wow. That's wild. What origin of Jingles,

1279
01:15:50,681 --> 01:15:55,030
which is the original jingles was
advertising. Hey, pull up, uh,

1280
01:15:55,210 --> 01:16:00,210
Sumerian cylinder seals and you could
see these things they used to do where

1281
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:05,020
they used to lay this clay down and
roll their message out onto the clay.

1282
01:16:05,980 --> 01:16:08,500
And I guess like if you probably
wanted to get a message to somebody,

1283
01:16:08,501 --> 01:16:12,570
you would send a seal, you send one
of these cylinders and then you, yeah,

1284
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:16,090
they would lay the clay out and they
would roll a cylinder on the clay and it

1285
01:16:16,091 --> 01:16:20,230
would read out what you had
to say to them and that wild,

1286
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,830
what would you think this says?
Like, Hey, those are the bird. Well,

1287
01:16:23,831 --> 01:16:27,940
I think they range in a meeting
that represents UFO was Brian,

1288
01:16:28,180 --> 01:16:33,160
don't you get it? Look at the Griffin and
the bottom UFO. That's an alien. The sea,

1289
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:35,470
those squirrely things.
That's DNA.

1290
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:40,680
So what that represents is the alien
came down from sky and Leo's rule and the

1291
01:16:41,170 --> 01:16:44,800
griffins are awesome bird
looking freaky lion things.

1292
01:16:45,070 --> 01:16:46,480
And what of those lines on the top?

1293
01:16:46,570 --> 01:16:49,120
It's like a male lion and a female
lines that what's going on there?

1294
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:52,600
Yeah. They're like high fiving what
they're doing knuckles. So it looks like

1295
01:16:52,670 --> 01:16:55,400
this is the number one
culture that the uh,

1296
01:16:55,490 --> 01:16:57,620
ancient astronauts theorists point too.

1297
01:16:57,950 --> 01:17:02,000
They love this stuff because it was so
far ago. You like, who fucking knows?

1298
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:05,090
It's so long ago who the fuck
knows what was really going on?

1299
01:17:05,330 --> 01:17:09,920
But these people in ancient Sumeria,
they had all this like,

1300
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,480
like they were really into stars. They
had all these um, images of like the, uh,

1301
01:17:14,481 --> 01:17:15,750
the galaxy.
They had a,

1302
01:17:15,751 --> 01:17:20,090
a depiction of the solar system with all
the stars are all the planets rather in

1303
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:24,830
the correct orbit. It's really
interesting. Yeah. Pull up a Sumerian,

1304
01:17:24,890 --> 01:17:28,730
um, solar system. Ancient
Samarian solar system.

1305
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,110
Is that horses having sex?

1306
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:31,330
It's one goat looking when we,

1307
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:33,660
when go look the other way in some
crazy thing in the middle going,

1308
01:17:33,661 --> 01:17:34,430
what do you want from me?

1309
01:17:34,430 --> 01:17:37,960
Everybody's banging everybody's name
and put your message to about to send.

1310
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,010
We need to commit this cylinder.

1311
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:43,640
And you can get the word out about the
way that that goat was looking. Well,

1312
01:17:43,641 --> 01:17:44,290
it's like today,

1313
01:17:44,290 --> 01:17:47,750
have you ever made a note on your phone?
And you couldn't remember what the fuck

1314
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:51,240
mad like at the time. You like,
I'll understand this so many times.

1315
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,850
Or waking up at night and thinking
I've got a lyric or an idea,

1316
01:17:54,851 --> 01:17:56,870
just note in it and they're
looking at it going, what the,

1317
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:58,990
what is it that you wanted?

1318
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:03,860
Um, Sumerian solar system.
Yeah. Yeah. There's a,

1319
01:18:04,040 --> 01:18:08,510
there's an image of the sun in the
center and all these planets that are

1320
01:18:08,511 --> 01:18:13,511
floating around the sun and they're all
in like the sort of a similar sizes.

1321
01:18:14,961 --> 01:18:18,410
Like see, see how it's like that.
Similar to what the actual planets are.

1322
01:18:18,411 --> 01:18:21,630
That's what it looked like in the, but
pull it back. So you actually see the,

1323
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:25,190
the image of itself,
the actual a cylinder image.

1324
01:18:26,570 --> 01:18:31,160
You just had it. Oh yeah, you can see it.
No, the image, the actual image of the,

1325
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:36,350
there's a clay image of it. See It on the
right. That's it. Either one of those.

1326
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:39,560
That's the actual image. And if you
see the op, see that right there.

1327
01:18:39,561 --> 01:18:44,510
That's the solar system in between them.
There's the sun and those circles.

1328
01:18:44,511 --> 01:18:46,940
Those are the exact planets.
And you know,

1329
01:18:46,941 --> 01:18:50,030
the bigger ones are bigger and the small
ones are smaller and they're all in the

1330
01:18:50,031 --> 01:18:54,800
right orbit. It's really weird.
Yes. Way. Most likely the standard,

1331
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,930
what they think is,
you know,

1332
01:18:56,960 --> 01:19:01,040
when I've listened to many people give
their opinions on these kinds of things

1333
01:19:01,041 --> 01:19:05,000
and how do these people know
what they knew and what I, I'm,

1334
01:19:05,390 --> 01:19:10,100
I'm have an opinion that most likely
at one point in time people were really

1335
01:19:10,101 --> 01:19:15,020
fucking smart and they had gotten really
far and they had learned a lot of shit

1336
01:19:15,021 --> 01:19:18,620
and they had lived for a long time
and then cataclysmic happened.

1337
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:23,240
They get hit by asteroids, they got
hit by, you know, super volcanoes,

1338
01:19:23,241 --> 01:19:23,841
whatever it is.

1339
01:19:23,841 --> 01:19:27,230
And whatever was learned was forgotten
and they started all over again.

1340
01:19:27,410 --> 01:19:29,120
And he probably did it a gang of times

1341
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:32,330
and paper to kind of argue against that.

1342
01:19:32,331 --> 01:19:37,190
We'll say just that,
yeah, would they have fly?

1343
01:19:37,191 --> 01:19:41,400
Why aren't there cameras over or whatever.
But I think the very nature of the,

1344
01:19:41,401 --> 01:19:44,900
of that theory is there's no chance at
all that their intelligence would have

1345
01:19:44,901 --> 01:19:47,660
developed in the same way
as did the technology.

1346
01:19:47,661 --> 01:19:50,960
Wouldn't have developed in the same way.
They could've been far superior yet.

1347
01:19:50,961 --> 01:19:55,810
Never invented petrol or use
electronics tonics, any of that.

1348
01:19:55,860 --> 01:20:00,470
So that kind of, yeah, it makes sense
of, it's our own arrogance now of going,

1349
01:20:01,010 --> 01:20:04,860
but you know, they didn't have
TV so I can't be that clip.

1350
01:20:04,861 --> 01:20:07,740
I how they clever that I can go to.
So true.

1351
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:10,800
It's so, that's such a
good point. And you know,

1352
01:20:10,801 --> 01:20:15,540
I think that people from England have a
bit of a better perspective of time than

1353
01:20:15,541 --> 01:20:18,390
people in America because if you're
in London, if you go through London,

1354
01:20:18,391 --> 01:20:23,250
you'll see thousand year old buildings.
Like you don't see that shit in America.

1355
01:20:23,730 --> 01:20:26,450
A wedding in Boston once,
and I had a dice burn up,

1356
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:28,230
popped into an antique
store and it was like,

1357
01:20:28,231 --> 01:20:30,540
oh by the fifties and
sixties and it's like,

1358
01:20:31,020 --> 01:20:33,830
that's not an antique store
had to England antiques.

1359
01:20:33,850 --> 01:20:37,080
There's like hundreds of years old or
this old stuff for theirs. I, yeah,

1360
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:40,170
this is antiques. This
is like ies. This is,

1361
01:20:41,360 --> 01:20:44,490
this is a long time ago. It's like, no,
that's not, that's not what Atlantic,

1362
01:20:44,550 --> 01:20:48,960
here's my friend. Yeah. There's bars in
London that are like a thousand years old,

1363
01:20:48,961 --> 01:20:53,490
right? Yeah. That's so crazy. The
whole place is, it's so different.

1364
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:56,070
Like when you're passing by the
palace and you look at that thing,

1365
01:20:56,340 --> 01:20:59,160
you see Buckingham Palace and you're
like, well that that, that's a palace.

1366
01:20:59,310 --> 01:20:59,941
It's right here.

1367
01:20:59,941 --> 01:21:04,710
They have a pallet and then it's another
thing in Nis went driving around.

1368
01:21:04,711 --> 01:21:08,910
I see a lot of the houses that are
kind of castle like and they think that

1369
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:10,800
that's what a carceral looks
like. It's like, have you been,

1370
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:13,020
have you been to a castle
because castles aren't really,

1371
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:14,790
causes aren't just houses.

1372
01:21:14,791 --> 01:21:18,720
We have a little square bit on top is
that there are these built out or rocks

1373
01:21:18,721 --> 01:21:23,150
and these huge things and you're always
entertains me over here. The, yeah,

1374
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:27,600
all the different castles is like this.
Isn't it weird that they sell castles?

1375
01:21:27,810 --> 01:21:31,980
Like you can buy a castle?
Yeah. Like you screw bees.

1376
01:21:31,981 --> 01:21:35,910
Pip could go back to England
and by a Goddamn castle.

1377
01:21:35,940 --> 01:21:40,450
I want to counsel now who do I need
to talk to about this? Joe Broken.

1378
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:42,270
I don't know.
We need to find the guy.

1379
01:21:42,271 --> 01:21:45,660
And connect you to him because I've
watched some one of those home and garden

1380
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:50,300
shows, you know when they're like people
work on how you a car so or you buy on a

1381
01:21:50,301 --> 01:21:52,590
regional and old.
They had an old castle.

1382
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,130
They were trying to do an addition.
Yeah,

1383
01:21:56,370 --> 01:21:59,850
add ons to the castle and they had
a fight like tooth and claw to get,

1384
01:22:00,330 --> 01:22:03,570
they wanted to like put a garage on or
something like that and like fuck off,

1385
01:22:03,571 --> 01:22:07,740
you can't, it's a castle. But
he's like, it's my castle.
I'm like, nope, can't do it.

1386
01:22:07,900 --> 01:22:11,180
Until they eventually let him do they
want to topic a clicker for the drawbridge

1387
01:22:11,430 --> 01:22:14,850
site. When they pull
off, I can just come on.

1388
01:22:14,851 --> 01:22:16,590
He'll be out like an RFID card.

1389
01:22:16,591 --> 01:22:20,610
They put in your license plate soon as
it recognizes your driving and opens up

1390
01:22:20,611 --> 01:22:22,920
the drawbridge. No one else
can get in. There's loading.

1391
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:25,930
There's a few different
costumes and England that
hotels now and you can just go

1392
01:22:25,931 --> 01:22:30,260
and stay in a castle that is hundreds
and hundreds of years old. I've,

1393
01:22:30,490 --> 01:22:34,950
I've done that before and it's, yeah.
Yeah. Imagine owning. You can though.

1394
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:37,410
I know people have,
I've heard of people that are famous.

1395
01:22:37,411 --> 01:22:40,740
People like by castle feel so
rude to put a TV and everything.

1396
01:22:40,741 --> 01:22:44,700
Even though later in this I would
cast on your leg kicking it out. Yeah.

1397
01:22:44,701 --> 01:22:48,740
You should uneven like it really probably
shouldn't even have electricity. Nah,

1398
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:52,320
you want to do exams? Everything
should be candlelight. Yeah.

1399
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:56,730
If you're going to do it right. I mean
that's where England basically like,

1400
01:22:56,731 --> 01:23:00,240
anyway, it's all holding candle there.
I know. That's right. Is it really?

1401
01:23:00,241 --> 01:23:02,940
That's the image that we give out.
Check this out.

1402
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:06,070
You can get some castles right
here. Kind of cancer. Video Castles.

1403
01:23:06,100 --> 01:23:10,480
Yeah. What kind of castle?
What do you mean? It's like
a, like, like a website? Yeah,

1404
01:23:10,490 --> 01:23:11,890
it's all cal state website.

1405
01:23:11,891 --> 01:23:15,250
I know one of them says the castle's
a thousand pounds a million.

1406
01:23:15,490 --> 01:23:20,260
Is that a million pounds? But it says
what's a pound as it relates to a dollar.

1407
01:23:20,400 --> 01:23:24,090
Right at the moment the adult is,
so that'd be about

1408
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:27,780
1.8 million.

1409
01:23:28,030 --> 01:23:31,920
So 1 million pounds is 1.8 million deaths.

1410
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:35,650
Pretty good deal for a castle.
Yeah. That seemed, it seemed crazy.

1411
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:38,230
It seems like castles or one of those
things that really wouldn't appreciate

1412
01:23:38,231 --> 01:23:43,040
very much. They don't probably worth
castle in Transylvania after it.

1413
01:23:43,060 --> 01:23:47,440
Well yeah. And it doesn't come
with a vampire fuck that 47.

1414
01:23:47,470 --> 01:23:49,930
Do you want to have a castle? Where
do you, what do you weekend? Oh,

1415
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:53,110
we go to Transylvania.
We have a summer home.

1416
01:23:53,290 --> 01:23:56,940
Wifi would suck in a castle.
Nonexistent.

1417
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,900
You probably would have to have
satellite Internet. I mean,

1418
01:23:58,901 --> 01:24:00,250
you might not even be able to get that.

1419
01:24:00,290 --> 01:24:04,810
I guarantee you they haven't laid the
lines down unless this castle has been

1420
01:24:04,811 --> 01:24:06,430
used by people for a long time.

1421
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,490
Alright. Uh, drove fruit,

1422
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:12,710
a trans surveying you on our last tour
and it just feels like the most underused.

1423
01:24:12,750 --> 01:24:13,583
Like

1424
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:18,990
they should put a Dracula Disneyland
or some shit there. Yeah, right.

1425
01:24:19,000 --> 01:24:20,930
It'd be the most,
that'd be a huge tourist.

1426
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:25,950
And you go through and here's eerie and
kind of run down and really no economy

1427
01:24:26,581 --> 01:24:29,790
going on there and you just think
this is Transylvania for fuck's sake.

1428
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:34,950
Surely that's the most surely asked,
most marketable real location.

1429
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,590
Like most people's mind to find
out that that's a real place.

1430
01:24:37,591 --> 01:24:40,380
That's not just a fictional
thing in a book. It's like this.

1431
01:24:41,070 --> 01:24:44,290
They've got someone needs to go
there and build a tourist results.

1432
01:24:44,460 --> 01:24:48,060
You should do it. You should do it.
You should contact a tourism board,

1433
01:24:48,900 --> 01:24:50,570
a remortgage my castle and I like,

1434
01:24:51,450 --> 01:24:54,420
I'll see if I can can
open up Transylvania.

1435
01:24:54,510 --> 01:24:58,090
But doesn't it seem like that would
be like a dope idea? Yeah. No.

1436
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:03,620
And you think of loads of kind of
what are way you have these um,

1437
01:25:03,990 --> 01:25:05,250
amusement parks and things like that.

1438
01:25:05,251 --> 01:25:08,610
It's normally in kind of shady areas
where there isn't anything else anyway

1439
01:25:08,611 --> 01:25:10,190
cause you don't want that
in the middle of a town.

1440
01:25:10,330 --> 01:25:15,330
They'll say that about Anaheim sir.
Exactly. That chance rude Orlando either.

1441
01:25:16,170 --> 01:25:19,080
But it makes them a
destination and oh yeah.

1442
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:22,380
Orlando used to big time
destination just because of those.

1443
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:25,950
And if you like what kind of like
if you had, Whoa, how about this?

1444
01:25:26,220 --> 01:25:31,200
If you had a fucking spot where you had,
it was like a amusement park,

1445
01:25:31,201 --> 01:25:33,870
but it was all horror rides.

1446
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,360
Everything was fucking terrifying.

1447
01:25:36,660 --> 01:25:38,490
Like they're doing an
American Werewolf in London,

1448
01:25:38,491 --> 01:25:41,410
Mays at universal for a Halloween,

1449
01:25:41,490 --> 01:25:44,300
which I'll be attending every day.

1450
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:46,830
See that shit that's going
to be fun did on mushrooms.

1451
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:51,790
But could you imagine that amusement park,
purely fat outs.

1452
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:56,880
Amusement Park for adults in Transylvania.
That's all Har. And then they set up,

1453
01:25:56,881 --> 01:25:58,170
they set up the entire location.

1454
01:25:58,171 --> 01:26:01,890
Like they have like fucking
like speakers in the woods.

1455
01:26:01,891 --> 01:26:04,910
We hear like horrible in the middle
of the night while you're sleeping.

1456
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:10,250
They scared the fucking shit out of you.
Everywhere you go.

1457
01:26:10,251 --> 01:26:14,180
Like people are a, instead of like,
you know when you go to Disneyland,

1458
01:26:14,181 --> 01:26:17,120
you see dudes are dressed up like fucking,
you know,

1459
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:20,510
Mickey Mouse and goofy and you go
by goofy's kitchen and goofy wavy.

1460
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:25,250
Instead of that, you have dudes
made up and like full har outfits.

1461
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:29,090
I'm terrified of working
this out of nowhere.

1462
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,650
Just had to know where they dive in.

1463
01:26:30,651 --> 01:26:34,550
Funny [inaudible] and then take
off into the bushes. They don't.

1464
01:26:34,580 --> 01:26:37,830
They don't fuck with people. They don't
hit them, but they scare the shit out of,

1465
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:41,840
I guess when you're going there though,
you'd have to sign so much shit to say.

1466
01:26:41,841 --> 01:26:44,870
You're not going to punch anyone.
Oh, was it? Someone jumps out. Yeah,

1467
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:45,771
and this is something,

1468
01:26:45,771 --> 01:26:49,430
I think this is like a camp where you
go camping and it's pets a horror camp.

1469
01:26:49,460 --> 01:26:52,310
Oh Great. There's no, it sounds
like a recipe for murder.

1470
01:26:53,470 --> 01:26:55,370
It's probably really annoying.
Well,

1471
01:26:55,371 --> 01:26:58,880
if you were like a crazy fucking wanted
to kill people, like Jason Style,

1472
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,650
wouldn't you want to do it at this
camp? It seemed so appropriate. Yeah.

1473
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:07,940
[inaudible] in the UK now where they have
kind of these Zombie two things or web

1474
01:27:08,911 --> 01:27:13,520
and it'll be in an old shopping center
or something that you'll pay to go and be

1475
01:27:13,521 --> 01:27:14,980
part of it and it will be all act.

1476
01:27:14,981 --> 01:27:18,010
Just kind of just jumping in and chase
and you were zombies and you'll be, yeah.

1477
01:27:18,230 --> 01:27:20,690
Living out the Zombie
apocalypse. Yeah. Again,

1478
01:27:20,691 --> 01:27:24,920
all of that just feels how many of
those actors get punched in the face or,

1479
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:28,850
or someone just reacting
in panic and her in people.

1480
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:32,180
What they really need to
do is make real zombies.

1481
01:27:32,660 --> 01:27:36,200
I mean like artificial
real Zombie have like,

1482
01:27:36,230 --> 01:27:41,210
well you do is you make like a Mike to
day a person that's not really a person.

1483
01:27:41,420 --> 01:27:42,980
So now we are person.
It's dead.

1484
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:46,460
He showed Scott it's shriveled up brand
but it can move and it comes at you like

1485
01:27:46,461 --> 01:27:49,970
it's going to bite you and you have a
sword and there's like hundreds of them

1486
01:27:49,971 --> 01:27:51,380
and it's like a new amusement park.

1487
01:27:51,530 --> 01:27:55,580
And this is when bioengineering
gets to like a really high level.

1488
01:27:55,581 --> 01:27:58,790
Like you know it's been said a
million times, but the phone,

1489
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:02,930
the process of that you have
in your phone was far greater.

1490
01:28:02,931 --> 01:28:05,820
It's far greater than the processes of
put people on the fucking moon. Yeah.

1491
01:28:05,900 --> 01:28:10,460
Right. Okay. So imagine what kind
of technology they're having today.

1492
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:14,120
They're starting to develop
all these artificial cells.
They can artificial skin,

1493
01:28:14,121 --> 01:28:16,580
they're going to develop
artificial body parts.

1494
01:28:17,060 --> 01:28:19,940
It's going to get to a point where about
thousand years from now you're going to

1495
01:28:19,941 --> 01:28:23,030
be able to make zombies and
know everyone's gonna know
it doesn't have a soul.

1496
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:24,680
You can just chop this fucker up.

1497
01:28:24,710 --> 01:28:29,690
I be carrying as a Zombie donor card
to say that we're not die. Definitely.

1498
01:28:30,020 --> 01:28:31,790
I want just turn me into a Zombie,

1499
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,780
but I'm saying artificial
many fly free access to it.

1500
01:28:35,900 --> 01:28:37,550
People are never gonna
allow that and see that's,

1501
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:40,520
that's the difference what you're talking
about as an actual person that becomes

1502
01:28:40,521 --> 01:28:41,420
a Zombie.
So complete.

1503
01:28:41,421 --> 01:28:44,750
I'm talking about as a constructed
artificial person that never had the

1504
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:47,610
potential to be an actual
person. It's made entirely. Yeah.

1505
01:28:47,630 --> 01:28:50,330
You know factory that
has no soul whatsoever,

1506
01:28:50,331 --> 01:28:54,040
but it's made out of an artificial flesh
with bones and moves at you and it's

1507
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:57,110
trying to buy you out on what do you do?

1508
01:28:57,111 --> 01:29:02,100
You fucking sword fight this bit on the
note book of people who are working on

1509
01:29:02,101 --> 01:29:03,270
making clones and share.

1510
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:07,860
How far down do you think clothing our
official zombies is? All that shit shorty.

1511
01:29:07,861 --> 01:29:09,990
They're first going to be
looking at a lot of my teachers,

1512
01:29:10,170 --> 01:29:12,450
especially my more
poorly thought out ones,

1513
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:16,590
a lot of them require like some sort of
a demise of civilization for them to be

1514
01:29:16,591 --> 01:29:20,610
valid, and this is one of them. We would
have to have some serious casualties.

1515
01:29:20,940 --> 01:29:24,360
We'd have to devalue life
in a way where like today,

1516
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:29,700
as as the answer that when people are
against cloning the dangers of it and

1517
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:32,970
they're not a real person and the risks
of playing God, it's like, well, no,

1518
01:29:33,630 --> 01:29:35,340
there's zombies.
We're only going to make them.

1519
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:38,520
We're not going to have them thinking
and acting with just clonings all right,

1520
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:41,520
as long as we make him brain
dead zombies essentially. Well,

1521
01:29:41,521 --> 01:29:45,090
if we really just decided to start
cloning people, that would be,

1522
01:29:45,540 --> 01:29:47,880
that would be a huge issue.

1523
01:29:48,090 --> 01:29:51,560
Could you imagine if people just decided
they wanted to make more scrupulous

1524
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:52,463
pips?
Yeah.

1525
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:55,080
What if they got ahold of your DNA and
it made a bunch of them and you didn't

1526
01:29:55,081 --> 01:29:58,950
even realize that they did that until
they were like 15 or 16 then you made them

1527
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:02,490
and you're an older man and you're meeting
yourself at 15 there's like 20 of you

1528
01:30:02,491 --> 01:30:03,570
and you're like,
what the fuck?

1529
01:30:03,571 --> 01:30:08,520
I'm not even responsible for my own self
growing up and the come in there to to

1530
01:30:08,950 --> 01:30:12,250
wipe you out and they're using your name
or that can be out and you want to use

1531
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:15,320
Rogan's a ton of Giotto pops Cosby.

1532
01:30:15,370 --> 01:30:17,700
Y'All look exactly like you
all have your fingerprint.

1533
01:30:17,701 --> 01:30:21,300
Is that what the Real Rick
Ross Ross thing? It actually
is. Is it a clone thing?

1534
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:22,740
No,
they don't know where to like at all.

1535
01:30:22,860 --> 01:30:25,680
The Real Rick Ross is actually quite lean.
Cut Them.

1536
01:30:26,070 --> 01:30:27,610
The fake Rick Ross is the one that's,

1537
01:30:27,900 --> 01:30:31,770
if cloning came about and you had
the choice of doing it yourself,

1538
01:30:32,190 --> 01:30:33,330
would that be of any,

1539
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,530
why would I want to clone myself but I
don't see how I'd benefit from that just

1540
01:30:37,531 --> 01:30:39,780
made me,
I don't get it.

1541
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:43,750
If it's not about surely you'd
have the rights to your own day.

1542
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:47,610
And I logically that be a key
thing rather than me finding out,

1543
01:30:47,611 --> 01:30:49,500
I'm bumping into scripts where it
would have to be, I would have,

1544
01:30:49,910 --> 01:30:52,410
you would find out that when
you signed your terms of use,

1545
01:30:52,411 --> 01:30:55,710
when you got your iPhone that you gave
up your right to clone yourself and that

1546
01:30:55,711 --> 01:30:58,590
they already knew. Yeah. So every
time you like use your phone,

1547
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:02,750
a little bit of your DNA gets in you
from your ear, wax gets into the speaker,

1548
01:31:02,790 --> 01:31:04,680
then you turn them in and
then it's make copies of you.

1549
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:07,740
That'd be some scam that to
expose on CNN or something.

1550
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:13,200
If they're making iPhones that take an
iPhone's then using those DNA collectors.

1551
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:18,060
Yeah, they're making copies
of screws. Pep. Well,

1552
01:31:18,061 --> 01:31:21,660
I think we're going to wonder at one point
in time we're going to wonder what is

1553
01:31:21,661 --> 01:31:26,280
it acceptable way to
consider how to engineer,

1554
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:31,380
um, our civilization, both like
as our society, like how we have,

1555
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,010
how we govern ourselves, how we
have laws, how we distribute money.

1556
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:37,680
And then also like how we breed.

1557
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:40,590
Like there's gonna come a point in
time when people become like super,

1558
01:31:40,591 --> 01:31:41,520
super intelligent,

1559
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:46,521
far removed from this weird sort of
ape like situation we find ourselves in

1560
01:31:46,531 --> 01:31:49,320
today. And if they get to that
0.1 day they'd be like, look,

1561
01:31:50,010 --> 01:31:55,010
how much should we be investing our
intellectual time into actively breeding

1562
01:31:56,011 --> 01:31:59,010
people the way we do every other
animal that we have under our control.

1563
01:31:59,290 --> 01:32:00,430
I mean the way we breed

1564
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:02,620
cows,
the way we breed dogs,

1565
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:06,670
the way should we just keep doing this
whole thing on love or should we just

1566
01:32:06,671 --> 01:32:11,671
love everybody and breed according to the
best way possible to enhance the human

1567
01:32:12,071 --> 01:32:12,520
race?

1568
01:32:12,520 --> 01:32:17,520
Is that but surely that in turn just
involve calming down breathing hugely.

1569
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:21,220
Because surely the biggest problem of
the human race is that there's far too

1570
01:32:21,221 --> 01:32:23,320
many of us to fit on this.
That's true.

1571
01:32:23,630 --> 01:32:26,950
Planet would that boiling pot
of having far too many of us,

1572
01:32:27,250 --> 01:32:31,690
it's like it sort of highlights the
reason why that would be a terrible idea

1573
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:37,050
because there's so many variables that
make society awesome and all of them come

1574
01:32:37,061 --> 01:32:38,990
from completely different realities.

1575
01:32:39,340 --> 01:32:42,850
Like the variable of the computer geek
is a very different reality than the

1576
01:32:42,851 --> 01:32:44,980
variable of a pro football player,
which is,

1577
01:32:45,120 --> 01:32:49,300
and all these variables like
in biological variables too,

1578
01:32:49,301 --> 01:32:51,430
like as far as like the
way your body works,

1579
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:55,510
it might lead you in one direction or
another, like relieved your desires.

1580
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:58,600
And that's what makes this whole world
so fucking cool and crazy in the first

1581
01:32:58,601 --> 01:32:58,960
place.

1582
01:32:58,960 --> 01:33:03,960
So could you imagine if we got so
far advanced that we decided to start

1583
01:33:04,481 --> 01:33:08,620
genetically engineer and go straight
away rather than everything that can

1584
01:33:08,621 --> 01:33:13,090
influence and, and yeah. And in
doing so, we lost all art. Yeah.

1585
01:33:13,240 --> 01:33:16,270
We lost all of it because
it's not functional and well,

1586
01:33:16,271 --> 01:33:20,410
because everybody's perfect. Everyone's
perfect. No one has any emotions.

1587
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:23,920
Everyone's rational and logical.
There's no more art. It's over.

1588
01:33:23,950 --> 01:33:27,970
We're super advanced, no. On our
and those strippers, this kid,

1589
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:32,770
well, we'd have robots copers and then we
would slowly start to evolve and people

1590
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,370
enjoyed robot strippers and
one, they invoice involved, uh,

1591
01:33:35,640 --> 01:33:39,610
and enjoyed meditation classes,
memory injection that they're not real.

1592
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,380
You just have like a Netflix
of like memories. Like, oh,
I just fuck that stripper.

1593
01:33:45,010 --> 01:33:45,131
Well,

1594
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:47,350
I think there's definitely going to be
a time where you're going to be able to

1595
01:33:47,351 --> 01:33:50,830
download memories. I think that's,
I think that is without a doubt,

1596
01:33:50,831 --> 01:33:54,070
what we're seeing with these
Google glasses. What you're
seeing is the beginning.

1597
01:33:54,071 --> 01:33:56,500
Like you could take photos
with Google glass, right? Yeah.

1598
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:58,510
You could look at things,
you can take photos. Well,

1599
01:33:58,511 --> 01:33:59,980
if you can look at things and take photos,

1600
01:33:59,981 --> 01:34:02,470
what are you doing when you're taking
a photo, you're capturing time,

1601
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:06,670
you're capturing a moment.
It's just not the best version of it,

1602
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:10,030
but it's way better than a painting
they use to capture type of thing that's

1603
01:34:10,031 --> 01:34:14,350
here now and pulling it into. Exactly,
exactly. But it's very two dimensional.

1604
01:34:14,351 --> 01:34:15,430
It's right in front of you.
Well,

1605
01:34:15,431 --> 01:34:18,880
it'll eventually become three dimensional
and then one day it'll be immersive.

1606
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:22,990
One day you'll be able to record and not
just record a single image. Like we're,

1607
01:34:23,020 --> 01:34:25,300
this is the baby steps. One day, you know,

1608
01:34:25,301 --> 01:34:29,140
this is like when people started at first
started figuring out if fire, you know,

1609
01:34:29,141 --> 01:34:32,050
and that what that led to is
the combustion engine. I mean,

1610
01:34:32,051 --> 01:34:35,590
think about that all the way up to
plane travel. It was figuring out fire.

1611
01:34:35,740 --> 01:34:37,360
All that other shit comes up after it.
Yeah.

1612
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:40,600
Well we're seeing now by being able
to take a photograph with the glasses.

1613
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:45,460
We're capturing time in a very rudimentary
way, but really for us, amazing. Yeah.

1614
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,270
Well one day we're going to be able
to capture everything about it.

1615
01:34:49,450 --> 01:34:53,620
The way your seat feels, the
way your hands are sweaty,
the way your beard itches,

1616
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,770
the way your clothes fit.
You're going to be in that life.

1617
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:01,370
So you'll be able to take someone's
memory and just run an a whatever it is,

1618
01:35:01,371 --> 01:35:04,730
you know, an hour program
to our program. You know,

1619
01:35:04,731 --> 01:35:07,010
people will be able to
upload their sexual exploits.

1620
01:35:07,540 --> 01:35:09,050
You mean that's going to be loaded?

1621
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:13,230
Yeah. We should remove the point
of need in a memory as such,

1622
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,130
because if you can just
access it all in Armenia,

1623
01:35:15,180 --> 01:35:18,390
it didn't kill our ability to actually
remember stuff cause you don't need to

1624
01:35:18,391 --> 01:35:23,100
ensure the same as how Google already
and now there's so much that you don't

1625
01:35:23,101 --> 01:35:26,730
need to learn or take in because you can
really quickly see who was in that film

1626
01:35:26,731 --> 01:35:30,600
and who and what else he was
saying. There's that kind
of instant things. So, yeah,

1627
01:35:30,630 --> 01:35:33,480
absolutely. I think the first thing
that's going to happen is there,

1628
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,050
there's going to be a search of your
memory starting from a certain period of

1629
01:35:37,051 --> 01:35:39,330
time where you're going
to be able to access, uh,

1630
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,840
like what you had said in
the past or did in the past.

1631
01:35:42,841 --> 01:35:45,420
And it's going to be more searchable.
Like to the point where I go,

1632
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:49,410
what did I say last night around 10
o'clock you said at 10 oh one blah, blah,

1633
01:35:49,411 --> 01:35:53,180
blah, while standing at this location.
And you know what I mean? Like it's right,

1634
01:35:53,190 --> 01:35:54,110
right, right. Yeah.

1635
01:35:54,150 --> 01:35:57,510
You're going to have Google for yourself
and that's why you'll be able to ask it.

1636
01:35:57,540 --> 01:36:02,520
Yeah. What you did and you'd be able to
pull it up of ruin the fun of arguments

1637
01:36:02,521 --> 01:36:06,420
though. Truly when you can accurately
say, now here's what you actually said.

1638
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:09,660
This isn't rather than, no, no, no,
no. I didn't say, I never said that.

1639
01:36:09,661 --> 01:36:11,440
I meant what I said was this, Nah, let's,

1640
01:36:11,490 --> 01:36:14,850
where are you on the next
logical progression, right?

1641
01:36:14,851 --> 01:36:16,020
Because it's Google's already,
yeah.

1642
01:36:16,070 --> 01:36:18,980
Ruined the bullshitters argument when
people bullshit about stuff. You Go,

1643
01:36:18,981 --> 01:36:20,930
wait a minute, let me go
over that. It's not true.

1644
01:36:21,170 --> 01:36:24,920
Like how many of those conversations have
happened since Google where those guys

1645
01:36:24,921 --> 01:36:26,930
would have been insufferable.
Fox forever

1646
01:36:27,050 --> 01:36:31,880
playlists. Weird. I've always enjoyed
in, in, in football or soccer. Um,

1647
01:36:31,940 --> 01:36:35,660
as, as you guys insist on calling it, um,
we don't insist on calling it anything.

1648
01:36:35,661 --> 01:36:38,090
We wish it would go away.
Follow pop.

1649
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,680
These white people in America would
stop attending. They like soccer to be,

1650
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:44,470
to appear more interesting.
Hipsters fuck off.

1651
01:36:44,471 --> 01:36:48,420
For years they were pushing for
goal line technology and all this.

1652
01:36:48,421 --> 01:36:51,800
Just see if it go will definitely happen.
All right. The main guy in charge.

1653
01:36:51,801 --> 01:36:54,490
He's argument for not having it was a one.

1654
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:58,670
The best things about this
sport is arguing over that
shit and I loved that as a

1655
01:36:58,671 --> 01:36:59,450
kind of best.

1656
01:36:59,450 --> 01:37:03,140
That's the best logical reason I've heard
that it's better not knowing exactly

1657
01:37:03,141 --> 01:37:05,630
like referees decision and
then the next day you're like,

1658
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:08,960
that clearly went over the line.
This is, Yup. That's great.

1659
01:37:08,961 --> 01:37:11,870
That's part of sport that that's
a big thing. I've been perfect.

1660
01:37:12,380 --> 01:37:13,940
And baseball,
it's so boring.

1661
01:37:13,941 --> 01:37:17,720
But they love to argue when someone safe
or out and they'll fucking play that

1662
01:37:17,721 --> 01:37:21,230
foot touching that bag a hundred times
and the guy catching the ball and the

1663
01:37:21,231 --> 01:37:22,410
foot touching the bag and he got,
yeah,

1664
01:37:22,460 --> 01:37:24,500
they'll play this shit over
and over and over again.

1665
01:37:24,501 --> 01:37:26,030
That's a terrible call by the referee.

1666
01:37:26,220 --> 01:37:29,530
I disagree from my point of view. I
think it was the right call Nola. Geez.

1667
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:33,480
Just saying, no, here's the Ariosa.
That's it. That was out. It's exactly,

1668
01:37:33,481 --> 01:37:36,090
it takes all the fun out of it takes
a little bit of the fun out of it.

1669
01:37:36,091 --> 01:37:40,830
Especially goofy sports, goofy
sports, you know? It's just like

1670
01:37:41,340 --> 01:37:45,720
it's a, it's a strange thing our obsession
with, with the scoring, you know,

1671
01:37:45,721 --> 01:37:46,560
I mean it's really kind of,

1672
01:37:46,980 --> 01:37:51,630
we have a built in need for war and a
built in need to conquer and built a need

1673
01:37:51,631 --> 01:37:53,490
to form tribes to go
on after other tribes.

1674
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:56,600
We figured out a way to do it
peaceably your support. Yeah. You know,

1675
01:37:56,610 --> 01:38:00,180
through organized high
level athletic competitions.

1676
01:38:00,181 --> 01:38:04,650
We have our team takes on your team and
if we win we drank and we run to the

1677
01:38:04,651 --> 01:38:06,340
streets.
Woo Shit.

1678
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:08,950
It's freaking has,
is that an intentional thing in sports?

1679
01:38:08,951 --> 01:38:12,850
Like I mean in MMA everyone talks about
is the 10 point must system the right

1680
01:38:12,851 --> 01:38:15,760
system during this an
active thing of well yeah,

1681
01:38:15,761 --> 01:38:20,020
cause everyone's having this discussion
and talking about it and engage in about

1682
01:38:20,021 --> 01:38:22,570
this fire rather than are,
you know,

1683
01:38:22,571 --> 01:38:25,120
it'd be best if we actually
knew who won and who.

1684
01:38:25,330 --> 01:38:29,470
The problem with that is sometimes
the scoring system is so bad and so

1685
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:32,510
ineffective that it leaves everyone
feeling like they got robbed. Yeah.

1686
01:38:32,710 --> 01:38:36,310
And you see our thing is I
think the scoring system works.

1687
01:38:36,311 --> 01:38:39,640
It's just you need better understanding
from the judges and from the,

1688
01:38:40,150 --> 01:38:42,550
from all of that. I think
again, almost any system,

1689
01:38:42,551 --> 01:38:45,190
if it's clear enough and
the people understand it,

1690
01:38:45,191 --> 01:38:48,130
then I agree with you in some ways.

1691
01:38:48,540 --> 01:38:52,890
But I um, I also think that it's
just not a comprehensive enough, um,

1692
01:38:53,610 --> 01:38:57,930
system to have 10 points. Yeah.
Because MMA is not one sport.

1693
01:38:57,931 --> 01:39:01,890
See if it's boxing thing about boxing
is did this guy uses hands better or did

1694
01:39:01,891 --> 01:39:05,040
that guy use his hands better? Yeah, this
guy did well then. Then he went and look,

1695
01:39:05,041 --> 01:39:08,610
we got, he scored a hundred,
you know, punches he five,

1696
01:39:08,640 --> 01:39:13,170
you know them where this and 10 were
that and 30 with any, you go over these,

1697
01:39:13,410 --> 01:39:17,130
these statistics and it's kind of
clear who one who got the round.

1698
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:18,390
It's not hard to pick her out.

1699
01:39:18,750 --> 01:39:23,430
But when you start factoring in things
like take downs and then things like leg

1700
01:39:23,431 --> 01:39:27,180
kicks and things like submission attempts
and you have a quantify what's more

1701
01:39:27,181 --> 01:39:30,900
important, whether it's the strike or
the takedown, what's more important?

1702
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,840
Is it more important this guy landed five
punches or is more important than that

1703
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:37,170
guy took the other guy down and held
onto him and did nothing and different

1704
01:39:37,171 --> 01:39:39,360
people are gonna have different opinions.
It's very subjective.

1705
01:39:39,361 --> 01:39:42,450
And when you're dealing with
something like that 10 point system,

1706
01:39:42,660 --> 01:39:47,460
one guy's going to get 10, one guy's
going to get nine. Like it's very screwy.

1707
01:39:47,490 --> 01:39:51,980
It's, you need more, you need, you
need like a scoring for Graham grain.

1708
01:39:51,981 --> 01:39:54,990
They're really Arasor scoring. Yeah.
With the right across each one. Yeah.

1709
01:39:54,991 --> 01:39:58,740
There should be like a score
for everything that happens
in the round and there

1710
01:39:58,741 --> 01:40:00,930
should be like ten nine for each event.

1711
01:40:01,170 --> 01:40:05,460
Like if they're standing up ten nine
Jon Jones Co control the standup.

1712
01:40:05,610 --> 01:40:09,540
But then John got it to the ground and
it was ten six cause he almost submitted

1713
01:40:09,541 --> 01:40:11,280
them, beat his shit out
of them, control them.

1714
01:40:11,610 --> 01:40:15,600
You know when it came to
take down defense, you know
this guy got the, you know,

1715
01:40:15,650 --> 01:40:18,870
and you could have it like that
and then count up the score.

1716
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:24,050
But then that'd be tough to, if they're
on the ground for a small amount of time.

1717
01:40:24,200 --> 01:40:26,060
But that time they were on the ground.

1718
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:30,790
This guy schooled that guy right there.
If they've got tens,

1719
01:40:30,890 --> 01:40:33,050
six for that. But that was like, that was,

1720
01:40:33,220 --> 01:40:34,940
well it depends on guns
and they've got no,

1721
01:40:34,941 --> 01:40:36,200
because if a guy goes
to the ground and yeah,

1722
01:40:36,440 --> 01:40:39,210
only for a few seconds, it's
not gonna mean anything, right.

1723
01:40:39,250 --> 01:40:41,620
You have to have a submission
attempt for it to mean something.

1724
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:44,400
So if the guy just went to the ground,
they got back up,

1725
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:49,401
I'd probably be a nine nine if a guy
takes you down and get back up and you get

1726
01:40:49,511 --> 01:40:54,310
immediately back up, it may be not
be even, but it's close to even.

1727
01:40:54,480 --> 01:40:57,360
I just think that if a judge
is properly educated on it,

1728
01:40:57,361 --> 01:41:00,690
then there'll be able to come close and
take all that into account and know that

1729
01:41:01,260 --> 01:41:04,980
that take down there were three takedowns
but he didn't do anything while he was

1730
01:41:04,981 --> 01:41:07,530
down or they got up straight
away. And I think if, yeah,

1731
01:41:07,531 --> 01:41:10,440
if there's a greater education on the,
on the judges that be out of work,

1732
01:41:10,441 --> 01:41:10,820
that system,

1733
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:15,820
I wish I was English so I could say
straight away and say it like normal and

1734
01:41:16,331 --> 01:41:20,620
proper and that's a proper fight. Um, no,

1735
01:41:20,950 --> 01:41:24,430
you're right. But I just think
there's not enough variables. Um,

1736
01:41:24,530 --> 01:41:28,000
or think there's too many variables
rather and not enough accounting for those

1737
01:41:28,001 --> 01:41:31,360
variables in the current scoring system.
Why is it that they

1738
01:41:32,610 --> 01:41:36,370
bring hope, Dean and
all these great Jew, uh,

1739
01:41:36,480 --> 01:41:38,880
refs into each of these places yet?

1740
01:41:39,210 --> 01:41:43,860
It tends to be the judges are more local
thing and local or why couldn't they

1741
01:41:43,861 --> 01:41:46,710
have the same lab with the
judges are kind of elite.

1742
01:41:46,950 --> 01:41:49,480
Here's the 10 best judges who
are specialists in memory,

1743
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:53,760
not a box in one weekend and kickboxing
or wrestling another weekend,

1744
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:57,630
only do MMA and therefore be more,
well that's the local athletic

1745
01:41:57,700 --> 01:42:01,860
commissions have the say on
who gets to referee, who gets
the judge. And, uh, this,

1746
01:42:01,861 --> 01:42:04,140
it's an issue that we
deal with when we fight,

1747
01:42:04,490 --> 01:42:08,370
when we have a events in certain places
that don't have a lot of high level

1748
01:42:08,371 --> 01:42:09,010
fights.

1749
01:42:09,010 --> 01:42:12,120
So you'll have a local judges that were
appointed by the commissions and they're

1750
01:42:12,121 --> 01:42:15,540
on television and they're doing a terrible
fucking job and they do things like,

1751
01:42:15,541 --> 01:42:18,750
they get too involved there.
They have two big egos,

1752
01:42:18,751 --> 01:42:20,310
so they like get in the way of the action.

1753
01:42:20,311 --> 01:42:22,710
They tell guys to fight
and the guys are fighting.

1754
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:26,340
They become a distraction
instead of enforcing the rules.

1755
01:42:27,310 --> 01:42:29,800
Seems to happen a lot less.
Like it seems to be that bring,

1756
01:42:29,830 --> 01:42:34,830
that would tend to choose the bigger
of refs from big events for big events.

1757
01:42:35,291 --> 01:42:36,124
It's critical.

1758
01:42:36,330 --> 01:42:40,530
If you have a big fight, you want an eve
Levine, you want herb dean, you know,

1759
01:42:40,531 --> 01:42:45,000
you want Josh Rosenthal before he went
to jail. Yeah. He want big John McCarthy.

1760
01:42:45,001 --> 01:42:47,930
You want somebody who's not going
to fuck up. You know it's hard.

1761
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:50,550
Correct.
It is.

1762
01:42:50,580 --> 01:42:54,960
His coats on the seminar on referee and
then judging and I think he's just, yeah,

1763
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:56,500
Mark's crate.
It's got such a good,

1764
01:42:57,390 --> 01:43:01,680
similar to herb in the
kind of the calmness in the
cage of knowing that. Yeah,

1765
01:43:02,220 --> 01:43:06,540
yeah. There's a lot of good guys
now. Yeah. Yes. It's a hard gig.

1766
01:43:06,590 --> 01:43:07,760
It's a very hard to dig them,
right.

1767
01:43:08,110 --> 01:43:11,860
Difficult to make the right decision
and you have to be on top of the action.

1768
01:43:11,861 --> 01:43:15,010
Can't let someone get hurt,
but you also can't stop a fight too soon.

1769
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:19,000
And do you have to be very knowledgeable.
There's a lot going on there. You know,

1770
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:20,680
there's a, it's, it's a very,

1771
01:43:20,681 --> 01:43:24,280
very stressful position that
doesn't get a lot of reward.

1772
01:43:24,550 --> 01:43:26,500
Like people don't appreciate
when they're really good,

1773
01:43:26,501 --> 01:43:28,270
but they get very upset if they're bad

1774
01:43:28,300 --> 01:43:31,100
and it's easy. It's an easy job
for everyone that isn't doing it.

1775
01:43:31,770 --> 01:43:35,480
It's easy to sit there and go,
ah, there you go. Yes. Yes.

1776
01:43:35,950 --> 01:43:39,790
That's, that's, that's absolutely
true. It's um, you know,

1777
01:43:39,791 --> 01:43:43,570
but that's true with a lot of things,
you know, watching it from the outside,

1778
01:43:43,571 --> 01:43:47,510
it looks like it'd be easy, but doing
that, it's way harder than what I do.

1779
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:52,370
What I do is tricky but it's not
nearly as is hard as being a referee.

1780
01:43:52,371 --> 01:43:55,310
I think that's way harder. Those
guys, people get mad at them, man.

1781
01:43:55,311 --> 01:43:59,600
They stop fights too soon to push them
to get guys fucking scream at them,

1782
01:43:59,630 --> 01:44:02,870
you know like and they have to
be able to control shit too.

1783
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:07,220
You know like when when things are going
down and you know if guys won't get off

1784
01:44:07,221 --> 01:44:08,810
of each other and they won't
stop hitting each other.

1785
01:44:08,990 --> 01:44:12,380
That's why I get nervous when I
see female referees and big men

1786
01:44:14,490 --> 01:44:19,490
cheffing experience in the cage is key
for a referee cause again always filled

1787
01:44:20,950 --> 01:44:24,390
the people like the people that
have actually fought or of train on,

1788
01:44:24,650 --> 01:44:28,220
on judge or referee and surely
that would benefit it will,

1789
01:44:28,250 --> 01:44:33,250
you know when someone needs help or
needs protected rather than yeah,

1790
01:44:34,491 --> 01:44:37,340
I have it. Having not experienced
it and kind of being outside on it.

1791
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:41,080
I think that's a good
point. Yeah. I think multi,

1792
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,550
most definitely having
some high level training,

1793
01:44:43,551 --> 01:44:46,940
most definitely understanding why
when a guy's in a bad position,

1794
01:44:46,941 --> 01:44:50,570
like on a guy's neck is about to get
hurt when a guy's arms about the snap.

1795
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:54,530
You know, like when herb dean stopped
the Tim Silvia versus um, Frank Mir,

1796
01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:57,530
Frank Mir broke his arm and
herb jumped in and stopped it.

1797
01:44:57,531 --> 01:45:00,290
He heard the snap and he stepped
in and Jen and stop the action.

1798
01:45:00,291 --> 01:45:02,870
Didn't know or wouldn't,
yeah, it wasn't tapping. Yeah,

1799
01:45:02,871 --> 01:45:04,700
he wasn't tapping and he was
still trying to keep fighting.

1800
01:45:04,710 --> 01:45:07,160
He knew something wrong with his arm,
but he didn't know exactly what it was.

1801
01:45:07,550 --> 01:45:11,000
I mean,
that's because her has grappled,

1802
01:45:11,001 --> 01:45:14,510
he's fought MMA is very high
level martial artist himself,

1803
01:45:14,540 --> 01:45:16,850
so he knew there was a bad situation.

1804
01:45:17,090 --> 01:45:20,150
But like say if that was like someone who
had never trained and maybe it was out

1805
01:45:20,151 --> 01:45:22,670
of shape and just didn't recognize it,

1806
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:27,110
that guy's arm could've got fucked up
really badly because if frank kept yanking

1807
01:45:27,111 --> 01:45:28,640
on it and he would have
kept yanking on it,

1808
01:45:28,641 --> 01:45:30,110
it wasn't going to let
that fucking thing go.

1809
01:45:30,260 --> 01:45:32,740
And he could have torn through the scan.
It could been a compound fracture,

1810
01:45:32,750 --> 01:45:35,800
could have been really,
really, really ugly. And uh,

1811
01:45:36,280 --> 01:45:38,960
I guess it is a compound fracture
when they both break. Yeah. But,

1812
01:45:39,260 --> 01:45:41,540
but when they puncture through the skin,

1813
01:45:41,600 --> 01:45:45,410
that's another level of severity because
you have to worry about infections and

1814
01:45:45,411 --> 01:45:46,910
it's like,
it's super dangerous.

1815
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:51,470
And that could easily happen if you've
got the wrong guy who's reffing a fight.

1816
01:45:51,920 --> 01:45:55,820
Tough job. Very Leon Roberts is another
UK guys. Very good. Yeah, he's great.

1817
01:45:55,850 --> 01:45:58,970
He's excellent. There's a lot of
good guys that are doing it now.

1818
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,680
There's a lot of good guys. It's uh, um,

1819
01:46:00,920 --> 01:46:05,660
there's a large group of people that
sort of grew up being MMA fans and got

1820
01:46:05,661 --> 01:46:10,250
involved in smaller shows and you
know, became like a, a trusted referee.

1821
01:46:10,460 --> 01:46:14,140
But you know, the gold standard.
So he's like John McCarthy,
Herb Dean, those goals.

1822
01:46:14,420 --> 01:46:18,140
And Rosenthal was great too, man.
Unfortunately we went to jail for that.

1823
01:46:18,141 --> 01:46:22,370
We'd son slang that weed. I've
been known as kind of phone. Yeah.

1824
01:46:22,620 --> 01:46:27,440
Apparently had some, some peace stole
lies she's not supposed to have,

1825
01:46:28,280 --> 01:46:32,150
they had to penalize. It's not
good. Roped. Have a good, yeah,

1826
01:46:32,151 --> 01:46:35,960
it sucked because he's a cool dude.
Yeah, he's a cool dude too. I mean,

1827
01:46:35,961 --> 01:46:37,640
I hope when he gets out
of jail they recognize it.

1828
01:46:37,641 --> 01:46:42,530
It wasn't a violent crime and
they reinstate him. But you know,

1829
01:46:42,531 --> 01:46:46,280
dudes in jail for like over a
year for weed. But you know,

1830
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:50,100
I don't know what you're,

1831
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:54,300
I guess it's like if you,
if you're selling medical marijuana,

1832
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:57,630
it's legal statewide, but it's
not legal federally. So I dunno.

1833
01:46:57,660 --> 01:46:59,670
I guess you could still get
busted for it federally,

1834
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:02,310
but he wasn't even doing
that was just slinging weed.

1835
01:47:04,140 --> 01:47:09,030
There was no federal involves. There's
like just getting paid selling plants,

1836
01:47:09,150 --> 01:47:14,000
which I support 100% yeah, I'm
tired. It's so stupid. It's is,

1837
01:47:14,310 --> 01:47:18,390
it's unbelievably stupid that it's
possible to lock someone in a cage for

1838
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:21,690
selling plants in 2010 it's dumb as fuck.

1839
01:47:21,720 --> 01:47:24,660
I don't care if it's written on a
piece of paper, it's dumb as fuck.

1840
01:47:24,890 --> 01:47:27,960
Suddenly people who want the
implants and they want to know,

1841
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:32,730
should he have guns on them know, probably
shouldn't have illegal guns on them.

1842
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:36,900
That. I agree that Pos harder to argue
Jack Census. I'm not arguing that

1843
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:40,140
the gun was not so much, but
yeah, no, I get that. It's crazy.

1844
01:47:40,780 --> 01:47:44,830
Yeah. It's just so sad and one day they're
going to look back and they're gonna,

1845
01:47:44,860 --> 01:47:48,370
they're gonna realize how unbelievably
stupid we were when it came to our drug

1846
01:47:48,371 --> 01:47:53,050
policies. Yeah, unbelievably stupid.
Like we took the most beneficial,

1847
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:57,430
the least harmful ones and we made them
the most illegal and put people in jail

1848
01:47:57,431 --> 01:47:58,690
for the longest amount of time.

1849
01:47:58,710 --> 01:48:01,010
For those,
it's the perception of it is as far as,

1850
01:48:01,020 --> 01:48:04,900
remember when I was younger and I was
smoking a little weed and doing a lot of

1851
01:48:05,050 --> 01:48:07,620
of acid and and shit like that.
I read in good times,

1852
01:48:08,030 --> 01:48:13,030
good times and read in Timothy Leary's
thing of of when he was saying how the

1853
01:48:13,231 --> 01:48:18,231
way society looks at drugs is legal or
not legal when it like his argument was

1854
01:48:19,380 --> 01:48:22,210
it should be treated like
a car that you have to buy.

1855
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,340
If you want to buy a seat, you
pass a test, you get your license,

1856
01:48:26,341 --> 01:48:30,840
you basically prove that
you're intelligent and of
sound mind enough to enjoy

1857
01:48:30,841 --> 01:48:33,240
this and then you go and buy it.
No,

1858
01:48:33,250 --> 01:48:36,750
like not because because the
one drug we've got an alcohol,

1859
01:48:36,751 --> 01:48:40,950
it's just you pay money and that's that.
Right? Anyone can have it. It's kind of,

1860
01:48:41,280 --> 01:48:43,140
yeah. I love that. The
first time I read that,

1861
01:48:43,230 --> 01:48:46,890
the small mindedness of
the way we approach it when
there's millions of ways to

1862
01:48:46,891 --> 01:48:49,320
approach the legalization of every drug.

1863
01:48:49,880 --> 01:48:50,031
Well,

1864
01:48:50,031 --> 01:48:55,031
it's also very strange when we
arbitrarily decide that one drug,

1865
01:48:55,130 --> 01:48:59,870
regardless of its impact on people's
health and wellbeing and crimes committed

1866
01:48:59,871 --> 01:49:03,320
under the influence of it, which is
like one of the most devastating ones,

1867
01:49:03,800 --> 01:49:08,800
alcohol and we make that our primary
drug and we just decide and one sad drug.

1868
01:49:10,641 --> 01:49:13,830
I'm behind that one. If
you get to do that, if you,

1869
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:18,910
you're dealing with a sophisticated
intelligent civilization like the UK,

1870
01:49:19,281 --> 01:49:20,690
like the United States of America,

1871
01:49:20,691 --> 01:49:25,220
like the Western world in the year 2014
you're dealing with people that have

1872
01:49:26,420 --> 01:49:30,650
just previously impossible
levels of access to information.

1873
01:49:31,070 --> 01:49:32,240
It's unparalleled.

1874
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:37,270
Access to information is never in human
history and yet in the face of this,

1875
01:49:38,030 --> 01:49:40,310
in the face of this overwhelming evidence,

1876
01:49:40,311 --> 01:49:43,940
you're choosing to put
people in cages for,

1877
01:49:44,260 --> 01:49:48,010
for plants like that.
That's it's,

1878
01:49:48,020 --> 01:49:49,030
it's, it's, it's,

1879
01:49:49,360 --> 01:49:52,670
it's an intolerable because we've
known it for so long that it's just,

1880
01:49:52,671 --> 01:49:55,420
except for with the same as we were
saying earlier with religion of how

1881
01:49:55,421 --> 01:49:58,930
ludicrous it is, but because it's
been there for so long, it's accepted.

1882
01:49:58,931 --> 01:50:01,510
It's exactly the same with that.
It's, I think it's changing.

1883
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:03,550
Think dripping down and
start it again if that,

1884
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:06,490
if that didn't happen in some
politician came in and said,

1885
01:50:06,491 --> 01:50:11,120
what are going to do is we're going to
put humans in cages and people look our

1886
01:50:11,610 --> 01:50:15,160
mental, that didn't already exist, so that
was a new thing. They'd be like, fuck.

1887
01:50:15,161 --> 01:50:18,850
Are you talking about about you putting
people in cages for plants that guys,

1888
01:50:18,930 --> 01:50:23,380
yeah, he's violated drug policy
number six five two nine zero.

1889
01:50:23,470 --> 01:50:28,270
He has more than one gram of marijuana
on him for personal consumption.

1890
01:50:28,410 --> 01:50:29,920
Get of that fucking cage.

1891
01:50:31,020 --> 01:50:33,320
Yeah. It's crazy. Just
change it in Brooklyn.

1892
01:50:33,590 --> 01:50:37,940
Didn't they just make Brooklyn
make weed legal in Brooklyn? Uh,

1893
01:50:37,970 --> 01:50:42,710
medical I think. Yes. I think New
York, so man, a medical in New York,

1894
01:50:42,711 --> 01:50:47,120
but I think they made edibles
legal. Really? Where in New York?

1895
01:50:47,390 --> 01:50:50,960
In New York, edibles are legal in
New York. Marijuana in New York.

1896
01:50:52,920 --> 01:50:56,360
Hmm. Hmm. That's nice. I
like hearing that Shit.

1897
01:50:56,410 --> 01:50:59,800
Florida was the opposite that everyone
told me like, well, you know, it's so bad.

1898
01:50:59,801 --> 01:51:04,260
If they find a seed in your car,
they will get you the other fuck

1899
01:51:04,290 --> 01:51:08,900
would you in Florida dude, they
only want cocaine. Yeah, totally.

1900
01:51:10,650 --> 01:51:10,951
Yeah.

1901
01:51:10,951 --> 01:51:15,951
It's a medical marijuana state as of
July 5th of 2014 so you can get medical

1902
01:51:16,261 --> 01:51:18,900
weed in New York. Good. Jesus Christ.

1903
01:51:18,901 --> 01:51:22,890
How is this 2014 it's happened.
Especially the medical,

1904
01:51:22,891 --> 01:51:24,420
which is by the way a Trojan horse,

1905
01:51:24,810 --> 01:51:28,300
but especially the medical
because the medical is, it's,

1906
01:51:28,530 --> 01:51:30,210
you can't argue against it.

1907
01:51:30,211 --> 01:51:34,830
People have inter-ocular pressure from
Glaucoma cures him. It helps relieve pain.

1908
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:35,820
It helps,
uh,

1909
01:51:35,820 --> 01:51:39,690
regain the appetite of people that are
suffering from aids and on Chemo therapy.

1910
01:51:39,691 --> 01:51:44,250
It's like there's so many benefits.
It's impossible to argue medically.

1911
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:47,900
And how long did you think it will be
before it just spreads over the country?

1912
01:51:48,000 --> 01:51:50,150
Because it seems that it works.
Everywhere is gone, right?

1913
01:51:50,151 --> 01:51:54,050
It's worked and it's good for
the economy and the best shit

1914
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:55,760
is when we get the people in Iowa high.

1915
01:51:55,940 --> 01:51:59,180
That's what that's going to make the
world a way better place. All those tents,

1916
01:51:59,181 --> 01:52:03,140
dudes are out there. Deer
hunting, get those guys. I,

1917
01:52:03,500 --> 01:52:07,700
everybody needs to just, just get it.
It's a perspective enhancing moment.

1918
01:52:07,701 --> 01:52:09,950
That's what's going on here folks.
It does do,

1919
01:52:09,951 --> 01:52:13,130
I mean that everybody needs to get
high. No, I don't really mean that.

1920
01:52:13,131 --> 01:52:16,400
Everyone needs to get high.
You don't have, you're a
happy person the way you are.

1921
01:52:16,401 --> 01:52:17,960
Keep on keeping on,
so on.

1922
01:52:18,320 --> 01:52:23,320
But the idea that people can't benefit
from something that people have Colin

1923
01:52:23,520 --> 01:52:26,450
really benefited from,
not just benefited from have,

1924
01:52:26,530 --> 01:52:29,750
but have stated over and over
again that they benefited from it.

1925
01:52:30,430 --> 01:52:34,970
You don't hear that about a lot of other
drugs. This is a great drug, you know,

1926
01:52:34,971 --> 01:52:38,360
and there's a lot, I mean, I benefit
from several different drugs,

1927
01:52:38,660 --> 01:52:41,600
but like caffeine, I benefit
from caffeine. You know,

1928
01:52:41,601 --> 01:52:44,960
we don't like to think of it as a drug,
but that's a drug. It's an absolute drug.

1929
01:52:44,980 --> 01:52:48,980
And I, and I like it. I love coffee.
Marijuana is a very beneficial drug.

1930
01:52:49,010 --> 01:52:51,830
There's a lot of great aspects to it.
Can it be abused?

1931
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:56,660
Of course everything can be abused.
Every single thing. Food can be abused,

1932
01:52:56,750 --> 01:53:00,080
but as grownups it should be a
choice that you can make. Right?

1933
01:53:00,140 --> 01:53:04,810
It's just about being disciplined. Growing
up. I mean, I'll stop smoking or stop.

1934
01:53:04,850 --> 01:53:08,570
I haven't had any marijuana in like over
10 years now, but it just wasn't, it.

1935
01:53:08,660 --> 01:53:13,040
It wasn't working out for me personally.
But that doesn't mean again, it's not,

1936
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:17,740
I'm still very pro as as as I
think everyone should try or it,

1937
01:53:17,741 --> 01:53:19,820
it's positive to try all these things and

1938
01:53:20,150 --> 01:53:24,200
the idea that everyone is going to respond
exactly the same way that any given

1939
01:53:24,201 --> 01:53:27,260
substance,
whether it's aspirin or marijuana,

1940
01:53:27,261 --> 01:53:30,650
I mean there's a reason why some people
are allergic to some things and other

1941
01:53:30,651 --> 01:53:34,430
people in jail like shrimp. Some people
eat shrimp and they'll get sick as fuck.

1942
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:38,950
I love shrimp. It's delicious.
My head to make it illegal.

1943
01:53:39,360 --> 01:53:43,040
I mean there's a good percentage of the
population that's allergic to shellfish.

1944
01:53:43,041 --> 01:53:44,630
It's a fairly common allergy.

1945
01:53:45,020 --> 01:53:50,020
And if they had chosen the same sort of
ideas that they have on like marijuana

1946
01:53:50,151 --> 01:53:53,260
addiction, this is one that they love to
throw around. Marijuana addiction. Yeah.

1947
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:57,860
I would like to put marijuana addiction
next to shellfish allergy and see which

1948
01:53:57,861 --> 01:53:58,910
one is more common.
Yeah,

1949
01:53:59,060 --> 01:54:02,570
cause I bet shellfish allergy is way
more fucking common than marijuana.

1950
01:54:03,050 --> 01:54:08,050
And so the idea of making it illegal
because one tiny percentage of the

1951
01:54:08,451 --> 01:54:10,550
population gets physically addicted to it.

1952
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:12,530
Well I don't know what's
going on in their body.

1953
01:54:12,531 --> 01:54:15,170
They might be physically addicted,
but for me,

1954
01:54:15,171 --> 01:54:20,171
I know I can stop and not have weed
for weeks and I don't feel any physical

1955
01:54:21,501 --> 01:54:26,150
pain. Nothing crazy. I've taken
two weeks off and had nothing,

1956
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:30,290
not felt a thing. Not not an
urge, not just living life.

1957
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,490
There's no want this no itch
that you can't scratch. Yeah.

1958
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:40,600
It's weird that we have these arbitrary
decisions that get made a long time ago

1959
01:54:41,841 --> 01:54:46,340
and that they stick just because someone
wrote him somewhere. We're so goofy,

1960
01:54:47,490 --> 01:54:51,090
addictive personalities I guess or or,
or physical addiction,

1961
01:54:51,091 --> 01:54:53,220
but people will have that for anything.

1962
01:54:53,340 --> 01:54:55,830
Did you see the New York Times said that,
you know,

1963
01:54:55,831 --> 01:54:58,380
they did a New York Times editorial
saying that marijuana should be

1964
01:54:58,381 --> 01:55:01,650
decriminalized nationwide and
the government had a response.

1965
01:55:01,651 --> 01:55:06,270
The New York Times that was so goofy
and it included all this shit about

1966
01:55:06,271 --> 01:55:06,871
children,

1967
01:55:06,871 --> 01:55:11,110
about the effecting the brains of children
are like no one saying give pot the

1968
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:14,760
fucking children. Did you even listen?
They didn't even read the editorial,

1969
01:55:14,761 --> 01:55:19,761
the editorials about adults
informed adults should be
allowed to smoke marijuana

1970
01:55:20,790 --> 01:55:23,940
and the government's thing,
like their response is all about kids.

1971
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:27,660
It's like you goofy fake babysitters.
You don't give a fuck like kids.

1972
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:31,740
You guys aren't in the hood. You guys
out in the hood saving babies. Fuck off.

1973
01:55:32,160 --> 01:55:35,850
Fuck off. You're not, you're not looking
after kids is not hurting kids. Stop it.

1974
01:55:36,030 --> 01:55:40,290
No one's saying kids should go get
high. Jesus Christ. It's ridiculous.

1975
01:55:40,320 --> 01:55:44,790
Goofy fucks. But that's the kind
of people that are responsible.

1976
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:47,970
That's the kind of people
that are responsible for our
laws are who's saving the

1977
01:55:47,971 --> 01:55:51,690
kids from shellfish? Who's, who's,
who's out there fighting that battle?

1978
01:55:52,260 --> 01:55:55,800
They try to say peanuts are
a big one, man. Yeah. Nuts.

1979
01:55:55,890 --> 01:55:57,930
Free schools like the schools.
My God,

1980
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,810
my daughter goes to my daughter
goes to a nut free school. Yeah.

1981
01:56:01,270 --> 01:56:05,050
Why did they still have nuts on
airplanes like I, they still do it.

1982
01:56:05,051 --> 01:56:08,800
Why wouldn't they just
switched to cheezits or
something? Like why is it nuts?

1983
01:56:08,801 --> 01:56:11,590
Anyway, screw question. Is it
something with nuts and flying?

1984
01:56:11,720 --> 01:56:13,040
There's tons of things like that though.

1985
01:56:13,041 --> 01:56:15,240
Like the realization
making me want nuts common.

1986
01:56:15,280 --> 01:56:20,280
But [inaudible] was talking about how
out how come when epilepsy came about or

1987
01:56:21,790 --> 01:56:25,560
we didn't go. All right. All right.
We don't need strobe lights then on.

1988
01:56:25,670 --> 01:56:29,200
And this is how that could kill you. Send
her into a fit. Let's get rid of them.

1989
01:56:29,201 --> 01:56:31,600
That's fine. We don't need, they're
not, unless it's like, no, we need,

1990
01:56:31,780 --> 01:56:35,470
we need to party my friend, just strobe
light. This is his wife would black out.

1991
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:40,030
She would see like one of those videos
online. Ah, just put them somewhere else.

1992
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:41,810
I thought he was fucking around.

1993
01:56:42,430 --> 01:56:47,010
You remember that Guy Jim from the message
board? Yeah. He um, he put some, uh,

1994
01:56:47,340 --> 01:56:51,300
some warning up like saying like, Hey,
you guys take down these fucking strobes.

1995
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:55,140
And then of course everybody changed
their Avatar to a strobe. Like fuck off.

1996
01:56:56,610 --> 01:57:01,140
Maybe just shut off avatars instead
of killing the party is if you like,

1997
01:57:01,170 --> 01:57:03,630
you know, didn't know that you're going
to see something. And if you saw it,

1998
01:57:03,631 --> 01:57:04,560
it was black you out.

1999
01:57:04,950 --> 01:57:08,190
You'd have to be like really careful
about your viewing habits, you know.

2000
01:57:10,200 --> 01:57:13,620
There we go. Don't do
that. I'm not. People die.

2001
01:57:14,520 --> 01:57:18,870
You shouldn't do that. That's
rude as fuck. That's going
to bring the aliens back.

2002
01:57:19,500 --> 01:57:23,160
If you do that, they're gonna
come back and land it's sea sick.

2003
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:24,810
Secret signal here.

2004
01:57:24,811 --> 01:57:27,450
There was some radio signals they
just found in the galaxy recently.

2005
01:57:27,870 --> 01:57:32,870
Fascinating new radio signals found in
the galaxy and people were speculating as

2006
01:57:33,091 --> 01:57:35,610
to whether or not it's a aliens.

2007
01:57:37,580 --> 01:57:40,100
What does it sound like?
Does it sound like static or is it,

2008
01:57:40,170 --> 01:57:43,230
I don't think it's like a sound.
I think it's like a signal.

2009
01:57:43,860 --> 01:57:48,660
Radio waves emitted from nearby
galaxy. Wow. Yeah. That's interesting.

2010
01:57:48,661 --> 01:57:53,100
Shit man. July 10th mysterious
signal from a galaxy far,

2011
01:57:53,101 --> 01:57:53,940
far away.

2012
01:57:54,120 --> 01:57:59,120
Brief pulse detected by the Arecibo
telescope appears to come from far beyond

2013
01:57:59,311 --> 01:57:59,941
our galaxy.

2014
01:57:59,941 --> 01:58:04,941
Could be caused by evaporating black
holes or mergers of neutron stars or

2015
01:58:05,790 --> 01:58:09,750
aliens. Could be aliens.
Could it be aliens? Yes.

2016
01:58:10,380 --> 01:58:14,460
There's a chance they could be trying
to reach us. It could be a chance.

2017
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:18,720
Did you see that video that somebody
shared it to me on Twitter where they can

2018
01:58:18,721 --> 01:58:23,721
take sound waves off video of like a
plant and like map it out and it will

2019
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:29,820
recreate what the sound was when
that video was recorded. Yeah,

2020
01:58:29,821 --> 01:58:33,460
well they can use a Doritos bag. Yeah.
Doritos bag. You see saw that video.

2021
01:58:33,510 --> 01:58:35,210
That was nuts. Incredible. So if

2022
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:39,950
you're in a room and say like you're
talking and you have like a Doritos bag,

2023
01:58:39,951 --> 01:58:43,630
they're like a light piece of paper,
they can focus on that.

2024
01:58:43,810 --> 01:58:48,490
And the s the impact of your
voice on that Doritos bag.

2025
01:58:48,670 --> 01:58:53,080
They can detect what you were saying.
They can detect the sounds. What?

2026
01:58:54,070 --> 01:58:55,320
Yeah.
See if I can find that video that was,

2027
01:58:55,410 --> 01:58:58,650
that is the mind blower of
the week's mind. Blowers.

2028
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:03,500
What are we getting excited about cameras
earlier and let's fucking insight how

2029
01:59:03,530 --> 01:59:07,270
much smarter or those people than me.
There's so much smarter.

2030
01:59:07,600 --> 01:59:11,800
Like that's not even a human like anybody
can figure that out. Like wouldn't.

2031
01:59:11,801 --> 01:59:15,910
When I think about my
potential for figuring things
out and their potential for

2032
01:59:15,911 --> 01:59:20,620
figuring things out, like you know the
tools that they have, the the, the,

2033
01:59:20,621 --> 01:59:22,000
the steps that they are head.

2034
01:59:22,001 --> 01:59:25,840
I could live a hundred lives and never
even catch up to where they never even

2035
01:59:25,841 --> 01:59:28,090
get close.
It's amazing.

2036
01:59:28,480 --> 01:59:31,060
Like when people want to pretend
that all people are created equal,

2037
01:59:31,540 --> 01:59:32,530
why don't you pay attention?

2038
01:59:32,680 --> 01:59:36,280
There's some mother fuckers out there
that are getting sound off Doritos bags

2039
01:59:36,281 --> 01:59:39,670
and guess what? Fuck face. They're
smarter than you. They're just,

2040
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:41,190
their brains work better.
Here we go.

2041
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,800
The results of this video or the
best experience through heads,

2042
01:59:43,970 --> 01:59:47,390
when sound hits an object,
it causes that object to vibrate.

2043
01:59:47,810 --> 01:59:51,800
The motion of this vibration creates
this subtle visual signal that's usually

2044
01:59:51,801 --> 01:59:54,590
invisible to the naked eye.
In our work,

2045
01:59:54,650 --> 01:59:58,760
we show how using only a video of
the object and as suitable processing

2046
01:59:58,761 --> 01:59:59,594
algorithm,

2047
01:59:59,600 --> 02:00:03,860
we can extract these minute vibrations
and partially recover the sounds that

2048
02:00:03,861 --> 02:00:07,550
produced them letting us turn
everyday visible objects,

2049
02:00:07,640 --> 02:00:10,070
individual microphones.
It's crazy.

2050
02:00:10,760 --> 02:00:13,220
Fuck the silent high
speed video shown here.

2051
02:00:13,221 --> 02:00:17,810
On the left we see the leaves of a
potted plant shown on the right video was

2052
02:00:17,811 --> 02:00:22,130
recorded while in nearby
loudspeaker, played the notes
to Mary had a little lamb.

2053
02:00:25,260 --> 02:00:28,080
Oh my God.
So now what they're gonna do,

2054
02:00:28,081 --> 02:00:31,260
they record it with the sound and
they're going to play it back using,

2055
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:33,660
even when we played the
video in slow motion here,

2056
02:00:33,900 --> 02:00:37,590
the vibrations caused by the music are
so subtle that they moved the plant's

2057
02:00:37,591 --> 02:00:42,390
leaves by less than a hundredth of a pixel
making the plant appears still to the

2058
02:00:42,391 --> 02:00:43,224
naked eye,

2059
02:00:43,830 --> 02:00:48,060
but by combining and filtering all of the
tiny motion happening across the image

2060
02:00:48,061 --> 02:00:50,760
that you see,
we are able to recover this sound.

2061
02:00:54,080 --> 02:00:55,370
Oh my God.

2062
02:00:56,960 --> 02:01:00,410
Seven in the future where we're going
be able to take a little video and find

2063
02:01:00,411 --> 02:01:04,350
out what we're really talking about
where JFK or something, oh my God.

2064
02:01:06,300 --> 02:01:07,740
Oh my God.

2065
02:01:09,090 --> 02:01:14,090
Six we five human speech from high speed
video of a bag of chips lying on the

2066
02:01:14,891 --> 02:01:15,724
ground,

2067
02:01:16,090 --> 02:01:20,500
but to make things a little
more challenging this time
we put the camera outside

2068
02:01:20,620 --> 02:01:22,150
behind a soundproof window.

2069
02:01:22,900 --> 02:01:26,680
This is what a cell phone was able to
record from inside next to the bag of

2070
02:01:26,681 --> 02:01:27,514
chips.

2071
02:01:28,550 --> 02:01:29,383
Okay.

2072
02:01:31,510 --> 02:01:34,840
Fleece was white as snow and everywhere.

2073
02:01:34,841 --> 02:01:37,340
That very well that lamb would,

2074
02:01:39,250 --> 02:01:40,090
and this is what

2075
02:01:40,090 --> 02:01:44,680
we were able to recover from high
speed video filmed from outside behind

2076
02:01:44,681 --> 02:01:45,970
soundproof glass

2077
02:01:56,220 --> 02:01:58,290
that's haunting.
Oh my gosh,

2078
02:02:00,690 --> 02:02:01,620
that's amazing.

2079
02:02:01,650 --> 02:02:04,530
So what that's going to happen is we're
going to be able to take old home movies,

2080
02:02:04,531 --> 02:02:06,030
especially like the eight millimeter kind.

2081
02:02:06,031 --> 02:02:09,640
That's like no sound that used to have
in the 70s we're going to be able to

2082
02:02:09,690 --> 02:02:14,190
eventually probably take that and actually
recreate the sound of everything that

2083
02:02:14,191 --> 02:02:17,560
was going on. How can those be part? As
long as they have the real nub number.

2084
02:02:17,561 --> 02:02:20,640
This on the film at the same
resolution as, as an example,

2085
02:02:20,670 --> 02:02:24,840
they're going to show it now at a very
lower resolution at this part of the

2086
02:02:24,841 --> 02:02:26,730
video and that this is early on.

2087
02:02:26,731 --> 02:02:29,430
So I think in the future they're going
to be able to get it to the point of

2088
02:02:29,431 --> 02:02:32,850
being able to do that because here's what
they can do with just a typical camera.

2089
02:02:33,170 --> 02:02:37,680
Uh, right. Like a to a laptop.
Yeah. Yeah. So here I'll show

2090
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:42,000
which can record thousands of in
most consumer cameras. Here we go.

2091
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:46,380
We can sometimes actually recover sound
at frequencies several times higher than

2092
02:02:46,381 --> 02:02:50,760
the frame rate of our video letting us
recover audio from video captured on

2093
02:02:50,761 --> 02:02:52,350
regular consumer cameras.

2094
02:02:53,790 --> 02:02:58,320
Here we see a 60 frames per second video
of a bag of candy capturing a regular

2095
02:02:58,321 --> 02:02:59,850
consumer Dslr.

2096
02:02:59,880 --> 02:03:03,650
While our Mary had a little lamb music
played through a nearby loudspeaker.

2097
02:03:04,220 --> 02:03:06,060
[inaudible]

2098
02:03:08,910 --> 02:03:11,940
and 60 frames is like half the
speed that the iPhone can do. Okay.

2099
02:03:14,810 --> 02:03:16,370
That's fucking saying

2100
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,953
[inaudible]

2101
02:03:18,180 --> 02:03:19,680
this is so strange.

2102
02:03:20,410 --> 02:03:24,250
By using a variation of our technique
on the rows of the recorded video,

2103
02:03:24,400 --> 02:03:26,200
we were able to recover this audio,

2104
02:03:26,230 --> 02:03:29,740
which includes frequencies more than
five times higher than the frame rate of

2105
02:03:29,741 --> 02:03:30,574
our camera.

2106
02:03:31,550 --> 02:03:36,550
[inaudible].

2107
02:03:37,820 --> 02:03:42,620
So yeah. Wow. Expect new, crazy
ghosts in the future from the past

2108
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:46,160
weird, weird world we live in. Man.

2109
02:03:46,820 --> 02:03:51,820
What a weird world that
someone can figure that out.

2110
02:03:52,900 --> 02:03:57,190
That's bothersome of control if you get
out in the first place is just insane.

2111
02:03:57,191 --> 02:04:02,160
Just the actual thing of having the idea
and perception of thinking of that is

2112
02:04:02,161 --> 02:04:02,500
just,

2113
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:07,420
yeah, yeah. That's a real game
changer, right? Yeah. Wow.

2114
02:04:07,990 --> 02:04:10,570
So humbling. Yeah. You know,

2115
02:04:10,571 --> 02:04:15,190
it's like I really feel when I see
something like that that we're in,

2116
02:04:15,580 --> 02:04:18,880
we're very fortunate in the time that
we live that we're going to get to see

2117
02:04:18,881 --> 02:04:20,010
these things.
Yeah.

2118
02:04:20,110 --> 02:04:25,110
There were a part of this insane moment
in history where things are becoming so

2119
02:04:25,721 --> 02:04:30,190
complicated, so quickly, so powerful,
so quickly. The, the impact of them,

2120
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:34,420
the impact of people's words, just,
it's never been a time like this.

2121
02:04:34,580 --> 02:04:37,970
What's the speed of it all is insane.
Like the speed that

2122
02:04:38,250 --> 02:04:41,280
the chain or the or the speed. We went
from the invention of the Internet,

2123
02:04:41,281 --> 02:04:44,970
which is putting everyone in the world
in touch with everyone else and then the

2124
02:04:44,971 --> 02:04:49,950
speed went from that to turn it into
something that we just look at tips on and

2125
02:04:50,370 --> 02:04:53,640
tweet people and talk
shit coming the the speed,

2126
02:04:53,641 --> 02:04:57,480
which we've just become comfortable with
this amazing piece of technology that

2127
02:04:57,481 --> 02:05:00,660
we should be using to find
out amazing things constantly.

2128
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:03,960
But 90% of the time we've
got so comfortable with it
because it's just on your

2129
02:05:03,961 --> 02:05:05,730
phone now. It's not, it's not this,

2130
02:05:05,960 --> 02:05:09,210
this great jump in technology
that well we take it for granted.

2131
02:05:09,510 --> 02:05:12,870
It's doing its work. Yeah. And it's doing
its work and its work is connecting.

2132
02:05:12,871 --> 02:05:17,610
All of us connecting all of a sudden mean
we're connected in some really bizarre

2133
02:05:17,611 --> 02:05:20,010
ways now, man, that's a,

2134
02:05:20,470 --> 02:05:22,680
I mean what we're seeing on the screen,

2135
02:05:22,681 --> 02:05:27,000
we're watching this video that's a
fascinating new thing and an amazing new

2136
02:05:27,001 --> 02:05:27,300
thing,

2137
02:05:27,300 --> 02:05:30,330
but it's probably one of like a million
new things that are coming out that are

2138
02:05:30,331 --> 02:05:34,620
going to freak us the fuck out. You know,
all this stuff is essentially magic.

2139
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:35,620
It's crazy

2140
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:38,210
how the F or freak us
out for like a minute

2141
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:41,220
and then be [inaudible]
and then it's just fine.

2142
02:05:41,690 --> 02:05:43,320
It's going to be an
accurate thing. Yeah, sure.

2143
02:05:43,321 --> 02:05:47,730
It'll be an APP on your phone and two
years it's creating time traveled by using

2144
02:05:47,731 --> 02:05:52,110
it like weird like old VCR type kind
of technology where we're going to be

2145
02:05:52,111 --> 02:05:55,000
recreating everything
that's ever happened. Yes.

2146
02:05:55,140 --> 02:05:57,540
So crazy on tree DNA or something.

2147
02:05:57,720 --> 02:06:01,320
So weird man. Yeah. You're gonna be able
to like watch an outdoor video and watch,

2148
02:06:01,530 --> 02:06:02,820
look,
stare at the trees,

2149
02:06:03,300 --> 02:06:06,930
listen to the actual voices that the
people were saying while there were near

2150
02:06:06,931 --> 02:06:10,290
those trees.
Well not only that,

2151
02:06:10,291 --> 02:06:13,920
the probably be able to like do things
digitally to change the resolution of

2152
02:06:13,921 --> 02:06:14,580
things.

2153
02:06:14,580 --> 02:06:17,760
I feel like probably some sort of an
algorithm where they'll like be able to

2154
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:21,710
analyze each individual
pixel on Hanse in post the,

2155
02:06:21,711 --> 02:06:26,130
the camera's reaction to the image and
change it and enhance it and recreate

2156
02:06:26,131 --> 02:06:30,270
reality based on some sort of an
understanding of the surroundings.

2157
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:32,680
I love the idea that this
technology could come about though,

2158
02:06:32,681 --> 02:06:37,681
but tha tha tha tha tha foible of it
would be they have to be near a plant or a

2159
02:06:38,130 --> 02:06:38,650
diary

2160
02:06:38,650 --> 02:06:42,240
package. Sometimes we've had
these great moments in history,

2161
02:06:42,241 --> 02:06:46,920
but it wasn't next to a plant walk.
We'll never know what,

2162
02:06:46,980 --> 02:06:49,890
where would that, where would
we, where would a safe place be?

2163
02:06:49,891 --> 02:06:52,950
Would it be underwater or
would it know? Well, would it

2164
02:06:54,570 --> 02:06:55,680
that'd be worse.

2165
02:06:56,260 --> 02:06:58,280
Imagine if they figured
out a way to watch,

2166
02:06:58,640 --> 02:07:02,460
oh, well I say around at three a
packets from now on. I don't want to,

2167
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:06,880
can somebody top smell shit,
shit. Stay away from Doritos.

2168
02:07:08,190 --> 02:07:08,420
I shouldn't

2169
02:07:08,420 --> 02:07:13,420
say figure out a way to recreate old
historical videos and actually make them

2170
02:07:15,030 --> 02:07:19,440
like a part of the oculus rift.
Make them like super high resolution.

2171
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,420
Calculate them based on all that.

2172
02:07:21,421 --> 02:07:25,560
Like say if they took the
Kennedy assassination and
they calculated it on all

2173
02:07:25,561 --> 02:07:30,290
known photographs of the area, they did
a very comprehensive analysis. They,

2174
02:07:30,350 --> 02:07:34,770
they in detail,
every photo of Kennedy's face ever taken.

2175
02:07:34,771 --> 02:07:39,190
Every photo of Jackie o ever taken every
inch of one of those crazy limousines

2176
02:07:39,191 --> 02:07:42,880
that Kennedy was driving in the
convertible limousines, every inch of it.

2177
02:07:43,030 --> 02:07:47,580
And then they put you in a virtual reality
where you're at the scene and you've

2178
02:07:47,581 --> 02:07:52,090
got to watch the Zapruder film play out.
Yeah. Like right there, like you're there,

2179
02:07:52,360 --> 02:07:55,350
you're looking at Zapruder
holding the camera and you know,

2180
02:07:55,351 --> 02:07:56,980
you could move around on,
I mean,

2181
02:07:57,360 --> 02:08:02,300
miss sounds like this whore ripper,
you know,

2182
02:08:02,310 --> 02:08:06,210
like, because the sounds from
reflections of like, yeah,

2183
02:08:06,211 --> 02:08:07,410
they'll figure out a way to,

2184
02:08:07,970 --> 02:08:08,241
yeah.

2185
02:08:08,241 --> 02:08:13,241
You wonder if you'll ever be able to
accurately like replay the voices.

2186
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:14,813
Yeah.

2187
02:08:15,250 --> 02:08:15,940
Huh.

2188
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:20,620
But recreations of historical events in
three dimension in virtual reality is

2189
02:08:20,621 --> 02:08:24,070
inevitable. Like, I mean, if people
are making paintings of Nixon,

2190
02:08:24,390 --> 02:08:28,630
they're definitely going to make like a
virtual reality scenario where he gets

2191
02:08:28,631 --> 02:08:29,750
shot at the theater.
Yeah.

2192
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:32,500
You get to see John Wilkes booth
sneak up behind him and shoot him.

2193
02:08:32,530 --> 02:08:35,530
They're going to have that pace
note. Yeah. Yeah. Historical events.

2194
02:08:35,830 --> 02:08:37,690
Any known historical events,
you know,

2195
02:08:38,210 --> 02:08:41,450
I'm writing as a story or song
or whatever at the moment.

2196
02:08:41,810 --> 02:08:45,850
About a guy that gets a chance to
meet some kind of God or whatever,

2197
02:08:45,860 --> 02:08:50,840
but gets told you can have one truth and
you've got to pick everything for our

2198
02:08:50,841 --> 02:08:51,201
history.

2199
02:08:51,201 --> 02:08:56,201
Like you could pick like to know what
happened with JFK or to know if Jesus was

2200
02:08:57,081 --> 02:09:00,170
real or wherever. And just
what, what would that one,

2201
02:09:00,200 --> 02:09:03,860
I mean in this story he ends up going
through all of that and then asking if his

2202
02:09:03,861 --> 02:09:06,740
girlfriend cheated on him because that's
the reality doesn't match the reality.

2203
02:09:06,741 --> 02:09:09,860
That's the truth that you'd
ask and need to know. But what,

2204
02:09:09,861 --> 02:09:13,250
what the fuck would you, it's weird
cause JFK is one that always come to it.

2205
02:09:13,251 --> 02:09:16,880
I'm the American, I've got no, I think
it's just cause it's such a conspiracy.

2206
02:09:18,030 --> 02:09:22,520
The want to know the
actual truth can amazing.

2207
02:09:22,800 --> 02:09:25,080
I think the, the, the actual
truth would be interesting,

2208
02:09:25,081 --> 02:09:28,900
but I'm pretty convinced of a
conspiracy when it came to JFK. I've,

2209
02:09:28,960 --> 02:09:31,560
I've seen the evidence that
Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone.

2210
02:09:31,590 --> 02:09:36,330
And one of the things that I don't find
compelling is that there was obviously

2211
02:09:36,331 --> 02:09:40,200
some,
the Warren Commission had a predetermined,

2212
02:09:41,370 --> 02:09:44,100
predetermined conclusion
that they wanted to reach.

2213
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:48,510
And that was that there was a lone gunman
and they wanted to reach it so badly

2214
02:09:48,511 --> 02:09:52,830
that they ignored evidence to the contrary
and even concocted crazy stories like

2215
02:09:52,831 --> 02:09:54,460
the magic bullet theory. Yeah. Yeah.

2216
02:09:54,500 --> 02:09:57,840
They only did that because they had to
account for a bullet that hit a underpass

2217
02:09:57,841 --> 02:09:59,370
and ricocheted.
So they had an account.

2218
02:09:59,580 --> 02:10:02,460
They had to make all these wounds come
out of one bullet cause they know there's

2219
02:10:02,461 --> 02:10:03,970
only three shots from Gospel.

2220
02:10:04,650 --> 02:10:06,870
The only reason why they
did it is to wrap up there.

2221
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:10,110
It wasn't like a scientific analysis,
like they looked at it all.

2222
02:10:10,470 --> 02:10:15,210
It was done by Orrin Hatch, who's,
uh, he's, uh, was it Orrin Hatch?

2223
02:10:16,290 --> 02:10:18,570
I think it was single bullet theory.
I want to say it was him.

2224
02:10:18,630 --> 02:10:22,320
It was one of those fucking
Weirdos from, um, the, um,

2225
02:10:24,120 --> 02:10:28,640
[inaudible] remember when I'm
Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas?

2226
02:10:29,150 --> 02:10:31,670
And there was a, do you know who
Anita Hill isn't Claire's tank?

2227
02:10:31,671 --> 02:10:34,580
Clarence Thomas Supreme Justice who uh,

2228
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:37,850
when they were trying to appoint him,

2229
02:10:38,090 --> 02:10:42,210
there was this crazy story that came out.
Like he, uh, told this woman Anita Hill,

2230
02:10:42,211 --> 02:10:44,180
that's really sexy black
check. He told her that, uh,

2231
02:10:44,181 --> 02:10:45,530
there's a pubic hair and her coke.

2232
02:10:46,520 --> 02:10:48,980
I remember that.
Do you ever find a coke,

2233
02:10:49,040 --> 02:10:52,700
like the sales went up during that
time or was it like Pepsi sales?

2234
02:10:52,970 --> 02:10:55,580
I bet that'd be fascinating.
I wonder. Right.

2235
02:10:56,930 --> 02:11:00,830
Pubic hair makes me want to buy Pepsi.
Arlen Specter. Sorry. That's who he was.

2236
02:11:01,100 --> 02:11:02,930
It wasn't Orrin Hatch was Arland spectrum,

2237
02:11:03,170 --> 02:11:06,350
but I think a Orrin hatch
was involved in as well,

2238
02:11:06,351 --> 02:11:11,180
but aren't Arlen Specter was just
like this known creeper. He's just a,

2239
02:11:11,300 --> 02:11:14,990
he was just one of those guys that
had been around. He was a Democrat,

2240
02:11:15,140 --> 02:11:19,950
switched to Republican, then switched
back to Democrat and he's just a shift.

2241
02:11:19,951 --> 02:11:22,970
He fucking character. And he was the one
who came up with a single bullet theory.

2242
02:11:23,450 --> 02:11:24,710
He was the guy who was his idea.

2243
02:11:24,711 --> 02:11:27,530
How would you say one bullet
just went fucking nutty.

2244
02:11:27,710 --> 02:11:32,710
It's crazy that they would even consider
triage is shit law that on something.

2245
02:11:34,041 --> 02:11:37,420
That's clearly the biggest case.
Gentlemen,

2246
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:39,500
good to be the most scrutinized thing,

2247
02:11:39,960 --> 02:11:43,290
but I think some of the eight 20 in
saying that it's stupid that they can be

2248
02:11:43,291 --> 02:11:45,890
equally as saying that they would
think, yeah, all that that we'll do,

2249
02:11:45,891 --> 02:11:47,840
we'll tell the people that,
but it did work.

2250
02:11:48,160 --> 02:11:50,890
I mean there's people that are arguing
today, so they were right. Like if,

2251
02:11:50,920 --> 02:11:52,780
whether or not they were right or not,
I'm not sure,

2252
02:11:52,781 --> 02:11:55,930
but they were right that people would
accept the fact that this one bullet

2253
02:11:55,931 --> 02:11:58,090
doesn't enough image to put that there.
I mean,

2254
02:11:58,091 --> 02:12:02,200
it's so preposterous in so many different
ways and I have conversations with

2255
02:12:02,201 --> 02:12:06,250
people, but you can't deny the
actual bullets dimensions itself.

2256
02:12:06,490 --> 02:12:09,850
The bullet itself was in pristine
condition of we've, you know,

2257
02:12:09,851 --> 02:12:12,700
people hate this conversation because
it's been done so many times before,

2258
02:12:12,910 --> 02:12:15,670
but there's also fragments of
it that it was left in the body.

2259
02:12:15,880 --> 02:12:19,060
The body is of Connelly, especially
where they weren't accounted for.

2260
02:12:19,061 --> 02:12:20,830
They weren't missing for the bullet.
They found the Gurney.

2261
02:12:20,831 --> 02:12:23,290
That wasn't a bullet that
did all that just wasn't,

2262
02:12:23,650 --> 02:12:26,920
it's not a bullet that shattered bone.
It just wasn't fucked up enough.

2263
02:12:26,950 --> 02:12:30,850
It just doesn't make any sense much more
likely since it was found on the Gurney

2264
02:12:30,851 --> 02:12:31,660
at the hospital.

2265
02:12:31,660 --> 02:12:34,870
It's somebody placed it there and to
pretend that people wouldn't place it.

2266
02:12:34,871 --> 02:12:36,460
There is preposterous.

2267
02:12:36,580 --> 02:12:40,630
The find a pristine bullet on a Gurney
on governor colleagues journaly Gurney in

2268
02:12:40,631 --> 02:12:41,464
the hospital.

2269
02:12:41,470 --> 02:12:45,190
Do you assume that someone place it or
do you assume that this is a bullet that

2270
02:12:45,191 --> 02:12:48,160
went through to people and just
happened to wind up on a Gurney?

2271
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,120
Either one of those is true or either
one of those as possible rather,

2272
02:12:52,890 --> 02:12:57,160
you know th th the the say that you
absolutely know that that's the single

2273
02:12:57,161 --> 02:12:58,990
bullet and this is the
reason why I know it's,

2274
02:12:59,170 --> 02:13:01,960
it easily could be placed there
and if it was placed there,

2275
02:13:02,140 --> 02:13:05,890
your whole theory of one bullet doing
that, then we have no bullet. Like what's,

2276
02:13:05,891 --> 02:13:08,170
where's the bullet that did all
this and what does it look like now?

2277
02:13:08,380 --> 02:13:11,680
Well it looks one,
sometimes you don't know.

2278
02:13:11,800 --> 02:13:15,700
So because he like finding the bullet
was the only reason why people were

2279
02:13:15,701 --> 02:13:19,340
willing to believe that one bullet
did all this damage. So they ha,

2280
02:13:19,510 --> 02:13:22,120
which is really ridiculous because
you would think that would be contrary

2281
02:13:22,450 --> 02:13:25,180
because like this is a bullet that
was like shot into a swimming pool or

2282
02:13:25,181 --> 02:13:28,820
something. It doesn't look fucked up at
all. Yeah. I don't know, man. That the,

2283
02:13:28,850 --> 02:13:30,940
the either or thing is a problem as well.

2284
02:13:31,170 --> 02:13:33,700
Everybody wants to say Lee Harvey
Oswald acted alone. No, he did.

2285
02:13:33,701 --> 02:13:38,250
And it was a conspiracy.
Could be Lee Harvey Oswald
was a part of the conspiracy.

2286
02:13:38,260 --> 02:13:41,760
Yeah, that's possible too. Yeah, they
could've, he could've been there. Patsy,

2287
02:13:41,790 --> 02:13:44,610
like he said, I was a Patsy, but he
also could have been involved in it,

2288
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:47,790
which would account for the,
the slang of the officer,

2289
02:13:47,791 --> 02:13:51,240
like a police officer was shot and they
attributed that to Lee Harvey Oswald.

2290
02:13:51,390 --> 02:13:54,160
He might've shot a cop because
he was a guilty fuck. You know,

2291
02:13:54,161 --> 02:13:55,980
he might've been in volume,
might've been one of the gunmen.

2292
02:13:56,010 --> 02:14:00,330
They might've been several gunman and
they might've just had that guy like set

2293
02:14:00,331 --> 02:14:04,140
up as a patsy from the jump because he
had a wife that was Russian and he was

2294
02:14:04,141 --> 02:14:08,970
from Russia. Either way that
killed Kennedy, I wouldn't,

2295
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:13,530
I wouldn't go back to see that.
I'll go back to go to Roswell.

2296
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:18,180
Yeah, I'd want to see if for a Ufo crashed
or it was just a fucking air balloon,

2297
02:14:18,780 --> 02:14:23,610
but the hot air balloon surely would.
That one feels to me like it would if,

2298
02:14:23,660 --> 02:14:28,230
if it could potentially have the
most disappointing outcome. Yes.

2299
02:14:28,720 --> 02:14:32,190
I'm looking forward to this and then
go, ah, fuck. It wasn't an air balloon.

2300
02:14:32,370 --> 02:14:36,720
I want my to confirm my suspicions
and my suspicions are like,

2301
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:40,080
this is my suspicions when it comes
to [inaudible]. This is the big one.

2302
02:14:40,380 --> 02:14:42,210
I think that people are full of shit.

2303
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:46,530
I think that there's enough full of shit
people to count for some really good

2304
02:14:46,531 --> 02:14:48,170
stories about Ufos.
Yeah.

2305
02:14:48,300 --> 02:14:51,570
Has anybody ever experienced an
actual Ufo from another planet?

2306
02:14:51,630 --> 02:14:55,740
It is absolutely possible. That's not
what I'm saying. I'm not discounting.

2307
02:14:55,741 --> 02:14:58,740
If you're the one person out there that
actually has a real unique experience

2308
02:14:58,741 --> 02:15:01,530
with a Ufo and you're not crazy,
I'm not discounting you,

2309
02:15:01,680 --> 02:15:04,830
but what I'm saying is when I look at
all the evidence with the Roswell and all

2310
02:15:04,831 --> 02:15:06,930
these different stories and all
these different crash stories,

2311
02:15:07,400 --> 02:15:12,400
so people are so full of shit that
it's much more likely knowing the small

2312
02:15:13,411 --> 02:15:15,980
number of these things that
actually get reported you.

2313
02:15:15,990 --> 02:15:17,670
When people say thousands
of sightings every year,

2314
02:15:18,060 --> 02:15:22,230
there's 350 million
people in this country.

2315
02:15:22,380 --> 02:15:24,690
If you only get thousands
of sightings every year,

2316
02:15:24,930 --> 02:15:28,220
what are the odds of those people
being crackpots? 100% yeah,

2317
02:15:28,380 --> 02:15:32,640
it might be 100% it was not a
hundred it's 99.999999 crazy.

2318
02:15:32,641 --> 02:15:37,410
It never happens to a really
regular [inaudible] and we can't,

2319
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:41,310
we, we must account for the number of
crazy people that we have that we've,

2320
02:15:41,490 --> 02:15:43,740
we've counted.
There's a lot of them.

2321
02:15:44,280 --> 02:15:49,170
So if people are just having
these episodes where they
start telling you about

2322
02:15:49,171 --> 02:15:54,171
UFO abductions and seeing ships that
are invisible and move faster than time.

2323
02:15:54,391 --> 02:15:58,290
Like it's also possible,
they're crazy and full of shit like that.

2324
02:15:59,120 --> 02:16:02,530
So I would love to go back and if I went
back to Roswell and I found an actual

2325
02:16:02,531 --> 02:16:04,410
Ufo fucking change my tune.

2326
02:16:05,040 --> 02:16:08,610
But if I went back to Roswell and I
would just saw a bunch of people standing

2327
02:16:08,611 --> 02:16:13,230
around a weather balloon, it's, it's good
that you are one is isn't going back to,

2328
02:16:14,060 --> 02:16:18,290
it's kind of about to, to disprove
something rather than witness. This is,

2329
02:16:18,590 --> 02:16:21,150
this is what happened. It's like, no
this didn't happen. Fuck that shit.

2330
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,620
I absolutely bullshit you come
come up with any of this anymore.

2331
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:29,070
Well I think I would like to be
open minded. Like we'll look,

2332
02:16:29,080 --> 02:16:30,250
no one would like it more

2333
02:16:30,250 --> 02:16:34,000
than me. If I went back and I actually
saw spaceships from another planet. Like,

2334
02:16:34,001 --> 02:16:37,870
if you could go to area 51 and they could
take you to the Bob Blazar place where

2335
02:16:37,871 --> 02:16:41,200
they have this fucking gigantic hangar
and you go inside and you see it,

2336
02:16:41,201 --> 02:16:45,130
that actual alien Ufo. Holy
Shit, I would love that.

2337
02:16:45,400 --> 02:16:50,400
But it's way more likely to me that you
get there and you see a bunch of remote

2338
02:16:50,501 --> 02:16:54,040
control shit that the government's
been working on and you see like some,

2339
02:16:54,041 --> 02:16:56,800
you know aircraft technology
that led to the stealth bomber,

2340
02:16:57,310 --> 02:17:00,790
which they know they built out of there.
That's more likely with the UFO is our,

2341
02:17:01,020 --> 02:17:05,770
yeah, that makes more sense.
Although little is back
engineering alien technology.

2342
02:17:07,770 --> 02:17:11,110
Oh I don't see a lot of evidence of that.
That seems,

2343
02:17:11,230 --> 02:17:13,690
that seems like you
discounting human ingenuity,

2344
02:17:13,691 --> 02:17:18,090
which is obviously fucking amazing. Like
look at this sound thing. Exactly. Yeah.

2345
02:17:18,350 --> 02:17:22,840
We are looking at already it's that back
engineered from aliens who want to see

2346
02:17:22,841 --> 02:17:25,870
what we're saying. Yes.
Distance. So I think you,

2347
02:17:25,871 --> 02:17:30,871
you're dealing with a lot of Dell minded
people that can't even comprehend the

2348
02:17:31,571 --> 02:17:35,470
intelligence level of the people that
can conceive something like a stealth

2349
02:17:35,471 --> 02:17:38,710
bomber. So they're seeing this, these,

2350
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:41,790
this technology arising there,
back engineered.

2351
02:17:41,791 --> 02:17:45,220
They're attributing it to back engineering
ufs when it really could just be

2352
02:17:45,520 --> 02:17:48,220
people that are so smart,
so much smarter than them.

2353
02:17:48,221 --> 02:17:51,140
They're not even the same
species. Yeah. Essentially. Yeah.

2354
02:17:51,350 --> 02:17:54,970
And they're just super fucking smart and
they figured out a gang of shit. Yeah.

2355
02:17:55,420 --> 02:17:58,890
That's way more likely right.
Lately. So the, the, the,

2356
02:17:58,900 --> 02:18:03,430
the people who work for the government
that have made it are aliens essentially,

2357
02:18:03,580 --> 02:18:08,020
in a way that much further advanced
than right. US. That's that stats.

2358
02:18:08,021 --> 02:18:12,260
The proof of aliens and Steven,
tell me he's on nailing that.

2359
02:18:12,300 --> 02:18:17,200
There is an alien. What's, what is he?
He's a computer voice, right? Yeah.

2360
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:18,501
And he is a,

2361
02:18:18,501 --> 02:18:23,380
is a brain that's connected very loosely
biologically to some movements that

2362
02:18:23,381 --> 02:18:24,250
control computer.

2363
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:27,450
It's essentially a brain
directly interfacing with
a computer through fingers

2364
02:18:27,480 --> 02:18:31,750
book alien. He's a classic guy. Helium
right there. Any warns us about aliens

2365
02:18:33,430 --> 02:18:37,980
is warning us about him. He's covering
his own tracks so much harder.

2366
02:18:38,020 --> 02:18:39,820
The plain sight right in front of us.

2367
02:18:40,090 --> 02:18:43,480
Pretended he can't move and waiting
and then he'll open up like the thing.

2368
02:18:44,550 --> 02:18:46,990
It'd be a fucking mouth and
chopped down in someone's head,

2369
02:18:48,220 --> 02:18:53,050
but in a sense petrifying in a sense.
He's an alien in that he's so,

2370
02:18:53,110 --> 02:18:56,290
he's like, he is something
that we can't even imagine.

2371
02:18:56,590 --> 02:18:59,320
We can't even imagine what's
going on in inside of his mind.

2372
02:18:59,500 --> 02:19:04,000
He is so goddamn smart. He's so
advanced that his concepts and his,

2373
02:19:04,001 --> 02:19:05,890
the levels that he's
operating on thinking on,

2374
02:19:06,100 --> 02:19:10,750
might as well be alien to some guy who
works at Krispy Kreme and keeps fucking

2375
02:19:10,751 --> 02:19:13,360
up and doesn't figure out which
button to press. You know?

2376
02:19:13,780 --> 02:19:16,810
Shouldn't say Krispy Kreme. Wonderful
establishment makes fine. Dawn's,

2377
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:19,720
what's the deal with that line for
that though? So they're delicious.

2378
02:19:19,840 --> 02:19:21,760
There's like 30 car deep in Burbank.

2379
02:19:21,790 --> 02:19:23,980
Every time I drive by I'm
like one day I like to try it.

2380
02:19:23,981 --> 02:19:25,090
It's not because they suck.

2381
02:19:25,150 --> 02:19:28,100
We usually do the Burbank one
is the shit dude cause it's 24

2382
02:19:28,100 --> 02:19:31,430
hours a day you need to do is come
home from a comedy club some night.

2383
02:19:31,460 --> 02:19:34,430
I've done that for coming home
from the Ice House. Stop off,

2384
02:19:34,670 --> 02:19:36,580
get some Krispy Kreme.
Got Hello.

2385
02:19:36,630 --> 02:19:39,420
It's like one in the morning and
there's a line of 30 people gluten free.

2386
02:19:39,740 --> 02:19:43,630
No God, no gluten free. Now

2387
02:19:45,150 --> 02:19:47,710
you're getting full sugar.
It's going to go right to your arteries.

2388
02:19:47,711 --> 02:19:49,500
You're going to feel like shit
for hours after you eat it.

2389
02:19:49,800 --> 02:19:53,250
But for the mouth pleasure that you
get for those that minute or so.

2390
02:19:53,260 --> 02:19:57,720
Are you eating one of those?
It's worth with those hours,
easily a pussy. You know,

2391
02:19:57,840 --> 02:19:59,730
what do you think is going
on with this Ferguson thing?

2392
02:19:59,731 --> 02:20:03,720
Cause I'm looking at it now, like they
just arrested the huff pro reporters,

2393
02:20:03,721 --> 02:20:06,990
the arresting reporters. They're
going into the Mcdonald's and going,

2394
02:20:07,020 --> 02:20:10,960
everyone needs to leave like employees.
Why we're gonna Arrest,

2395
02:20:12,020 --> 02:20:15,690
you know who to fall is
Westley low rate is w.

2396
02:20:15,691 --> 02:20:20,691
E.

2397
02:20:20,730 --> 02:20:21,361
S. L. E. Y. L. O. W.
E. R. Y. He writes for,

2398
02:20:21,361 --> 02:20:25,900
I think the Washington Post is formally
of the Boston Globe and the La Times

2399
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:25,900
Huffington

2400
02:20:25,900 --> 02:20:30,250
post reporter arrested in
Ferguson. Yeah. It's uh,

2401
02:20:30,610 --> 02:20:35,110
it says Ryan J. Ryan.
Oh Ryan J. Riley Rather.

2402
02:20:35,770 --> 02:20:39,010
This is fucking crazy.
Why Ryan J.

2403
02:20:39,010 --> 02:20:43,060
Riley and the Washington Post is Wesley
Lowery were arrested Wednesday while

2404
02:20:43,061 --> 02:20:44,830
covering the protests in Ferguson,

2405
02:20:44,831 --> 02:20:48,400
Missouri surrounding the death of an
unarmed African American teenager,

2406
02:20:48,401 --> 02:20:52,840
Michael Brown, who was shot to death by
police by a police officer last week.

2407
02:20:53,080 --> 02:20:57,460
Riley tweeted that around 8:00 PM the
Swat officers invaded the McDonald's at

2408
02:20:57,461 --> 02:21:01,780
which he was working requested
information after he took a photo of them.

2409
02:21:02,350 --> 02:21:07,300
Lowery was also working at the
fast food restaurant. Whoa.

2410
02:21:07,570 --> 02:21:12,190
Wait a minute. How are Huffington
post reporters arrested? Oh,

2411
02:21:12,191 --> 02:21:17,191
huffpost caused the Ferguson Baba Baba
status of Riley after tweets that he had

2412
02:21:17,531 --> 02:21:20,020
been arrested. The person who picked
up the phone identified himself.

2413
02:21:20,021 --> 02:21:22,300
As George said, he couldn't give
any information at this time.

2414
02:21:22,810 --> 02:21:23,890
So who got arrested?

2415
02:21:24,520 --> 02:21:26,440
Infused repair for the West?

2416
02:21:27,440 --> 02:21:29,840
Yes,
I'm a Los Angeles Times reporter.

2417
02:21:30,020 --> 02:21:33,200
Matt Pearce talked to
the police department

2418
02:21:33,810 --> 02:21:36,000
and this guy used to work for
the Boston Globe and looks,

2419
02:21:36,030 --> 02:21:39,540
offers slurs slammed me into a fountain
soda machine because I was confused at

2420
02:21:39,541 --> 02:21:42,090
which door they were asking
me to walk out. And he's,

2421
02:21:42,120 --> 02:21:45,090
this is a reporter that was
waiting to be taken away.

2422
02:21:45,091 --> 02:21:49,560
Large black man screaming for help in the
back of police truck. Whoa. I'm dying.

2423
02:21:49,561 --> 02:21:51,720
I'm dying. Please call the, he screamed.

2424
02:21:52,700 --> 02:21:54,710
Yeah. I'm still trying to
figure out which huffing

2425
02:21:55,090 --> 02:21:57,070
posts guy find got arrested.

2426
02:21:57,340 --> 02:22:01,210
Also Ryan really of huff pro assaulted.
Interested.

2427
02:22:01,750 --> 02:22:06,460
Wow. So those guys, so who, why does
it say that there? Oh, I get it.

2428
02:22:06,490 --> 02:22:11,200
I'm sorry. They were working
on their laptops at Mcdonald's.

2429
02:22:11,201 --> 02:22:15,250
That's not right. A working
for McDonald's. Right. Oh Wow.

2430
02:22:15,251 --> 02:22:20,230
So they came in while they were working
and they ask for their ID and when they

2431
02:22:20,231 --> 02:22:22,750
took a photo,
Holy Shit.

2432
02:22:23,170 --> 02:22:26,130
Like that's like beyond
overstepping bounds.

2433
02:22:26,250 --> 02:22:30,270
There was also a video that someone put
up online of some people filming cops

2434
02:22:30,450 --> 02:22:33,120
and the cop point to gun arm and
tells him to get the fuck out of here.

2435
02:22:33,270 --> 02:22:34,350
And they all start screaming.

2436
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:37,560
It's really crazy shit at the cops
says get the fuck out of here.

2437
02:22:37,561 --> 02:22:42,270
And he points the gun at them. You
know, it's, it's some dark shit man.

2438
02:22:44,670 --> 02:22:45,503
It's,

2439
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:49,920
this is all what everyone was
terrified of when that um,

2440
02:22:49,950 --> 02:22:53,970
that operation, um, or that a occupy
Wall Street shit was going on.

2441
02:22:54,480 --> 02:22:59,100
What they were worried most does that
at one point in time, the United States,

2442
02:22:59,130 --> 02:23:00,180
there's going to have something,

2443
02:23:00,181 --> 02:23:05,181
something that just wakes people up to
shit like this and they actually start

2444
02:23:05,731 --> 02:23:10,230
writing. You know. And that's a
terrifying thing for, for police.

2445
02:23:10,231 --> 02:23:14,460
It's a terrifying thing for law
enforcement for before you know,

2446
02:23:14,760 --> 02:23:18,690
any form of government. When you
have this, this happen, these things,

2447
02:23:18,720 --> 02:23:23,100
these types of things, they
build momentum. It gets,

2448
02:23:23,190 --> 02:23:27,420
it gets real scary when people feel
like the police is doing them wrong and

2449
02:23:27,421 --> 02:23:28,320
people,
they have a,

2450
02:23:28,321 --> 02:23:31,530
there's a battle between people in the
police and they start shooting rubber

2451
02:23:31,531 --> 02:23:33,000
bullets had crowds like
they're doing here.

2452
02:23:33,001 --> 02:23:35,940
They're just hitting random people in
the crowds trying to disperse them.

2453
02:23:36,630 --> 02:23:39,570
You can't do that, man. This
is, this is dangerous shit.

2454
02:23:39,900 --> 02:23:42,690
This is how people get
overthrown was a pitcher from it.

2455
02:23:43,530 --> 02:23:47,730
You know the Shah of Iran got overthrown.
One of the,

2456
02:23:47,731 --> 02:23:49,460
one of the reasons why they,

2457
02:23:49,520 --> 02:23:52,870
they rose up against him is because he
was starting to say that they were going

2458
02:23:52,871 --> 02:23:56,790
to attack people if they were in any
sort of formation for more than two or

2459
02:23:56,791 --> 02:23:59,520
three people were together and
they formed any sort of a group,

2460
02:23:59,790 --> 02:24:02,280
they're going to arrest them all,
shoot him onsite next day.

2461
02:24:02,281 --> 02:24:06,200
There's like 2 million. We
have a breaking point. Yeah.

2462
02:24:06,201 --> 02:24:10,010
As things have gone right.
We can't, yeah. Yeah. We'll,

2463
02:24:10,011 --> 02:24:13,340
we'll just tough because there's always
going to be a load of smaller breaking

2464
02:24:13,350 --> 02:24:16,980
points along the way that don't cause
the chain but change but calls a lot of

2465
02:24:17,820 --> 02:24:19,440
bad, bad. Yeah.

2466
02:24:19,890 --> 02:24:24,450
This is crazy and actions crazy that
they feel like that they can just arrest

2467
02:24:24,451 --> 02:24:26,130
people that are in Mcdonald's.

2468
02:24:26,130 --> 02:24:29,440
Like are you protecting or serving when
you're doing that? Which one? Yeah.

2469
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:31,620
What are you doing?
Guys are in Mcdonald's.

2470
02:24:31,621 --> 02:24:36,540
There were reporters and you're allowed
to just come in and disturb them because

2471
02:24:36,541 --> 02:24:39,510
you think the what? They took a photo
of some crazy shit that's going down.

2472
02:24:39,511 --> 02:24:41,460
You don't want to being
released is this protocol,

2473
02:24:41,461 --> 02:24:43,650
are you following like this is like a,

2474
02:24:43,651 --> 02:24:45,630
is this in your book of
what you're supposed to do?

2475
02:24:46,410 --> 02:24:50,910
They were arrested for not packing
their bags quick enough. Wow.

2476
02:24:51,480 --> 02:24:52,313
Solaris.

2477
02:24:53,610 --> 02:24:56,100
They can just decide to come into
McDonald's and kicked everybody else out.

2478
02:24:56,160 --> 02:24:59,220
Meanwhile, the streets are flooded
with people. That's so strange.

2479
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:03,780
Why would they kick everyone
out of Mcdonald's anyway?
Yeah. Is that, I don't know.

2480
02:25:03,810 --> 02:25:07,380
Mcdonald's is property. I think
when, when shit hits the fan,

2481
02:25:07,920 --> 02:25:11,880
when you have a situation like this and
people from the police and civilians are

2482
02:25:11,881 --> 02:25:16,680
fighting, it's like things get real hairy
and there's a lot of like huge, huge,

2483
02:25:16,681 --> 02:25:21,030
huge mistakes that get made and there's
a lot stress and a lot of pressure and

2484
02:25:21,660 --> 02:25:23,980
it's going to be real tough
to calm fucking thing down

2485
02:25:24,520 --> 02:25:29,520
and it just spread so much
more now because of Twitter
and because of everything

2486
02:25:30,071 --> 02:25:34,000
else it becomes this. Everyone
knows about it, which yeah,

2487
02:25:34,020 --> 02:25:38,200
as far as it all out more. Right. Most of
the time you live in England, right? Yeah.

2488
02:25:38,410 --> 02:25:42,410
And in England the cops don't have
guns right now. So is there ever any,

2489
02:25:42,411 --> 02:25:46,460
this kind of riding still
has been yet there's um,

2490
02:25:48,520 --> 02:25:51,700
a break.
You put a regular police don't have guns,

2491
02:25:51,701 --> 02:25:56,320
but there are oversee like different
units or higher up things where it can be

2492
02:25:56,321 --> 02:25:59,910
the case in, yeah. Yeah. There has been,

2493
02:26:00,070 --> 02:26:01,480
it was a couple of years ago,

2494
02:26:01,481 --> 02:26:06,440
there was a big one where a kid was show
because they fought, he was now armed.

2495
02:26:06,940 --> 02:26:10,540
Armed police had been called out for an
incident and the guard wasn't armed and

2496
02:26:10,541 --> 02:26:14,530
it caused a riots for days and days.
Kind of in London,

2497
02:26:14,531 --> 02:26:15,820
but similar type of situation.

2498
02:26:15,820 --> 02:26:20,820
It's just not as regular and not as as
far railroad because yet it's not any

2499
02:26:22,151 --> 02:26:26,970
policeman, the policeman in Mcdonald's
or wherever else, not everyone has go.

2500
02:26:27,330 --> 02:26:31,360
Yeah. Is weaponized. That's a weird
thing. How does the police deal?

2501
02:26:31,480 --> 02:26:36,010
Like how often is violent
crime with guns take place?

2502
02:26:36,011 --> 02:26:38,680
How often does that in England,
it's not that regularly.

2503
02:26:38,900 --> 02:26:43,120
Is there is that again as
everywhere there are guns,

2504
02:26:43,121 --> 02:26:46,570
there are knives like there
is crime going on, but yeah,

2505
02:26:46,600 --> 02:26:51,600
it's no where near as as regular thing
[inaudible] even proportionately,

2506
02:26:52,451 --> 02:26:55,180
obviously there's millions and millions
more people in the u s but still say

2507
02:26:55,181 --> 02:26:58,150
percentage wise it's far more regular.
Yeah.

2508
02:26:58,151 --> 02:27:00,940
And every now and then
there's like some sort of a,

2509
02:27:00,970 --> 02:27:05,550
like that Lee Marie situation where they
had that crazy bank robbery. Yeah. That,

2510
02:27:05,570 --> 02:27:08,220
that was fucking nuts,
man. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2511
02:27:08,230 --> 02:27:11,140
Full armor on and masks and you know,

2512
02:27:11,170 --> 02:27:14,470
Ski Matt Ski Goggles on and Shit.
You couldn't see their faces.

2513
02:27:14,980 --> 02:27:17,200
And it's weird because stuff,
right? That wasn't that,

2514
02:27:18,210 --> 02:27:23,140
that you thought that wasn't that big
a news story coming. It was, it wasn't,

2515
02:27:23,141 --> 02:27:26,050
no, it was the biggest bank robbery
in all of England. Right? Again, yeah.

2516
02:27:26,051 --> 02:27:26,884
But it wasn't,
it,

2517
02:27:26,930 --> 02:27:31,930
it wasn't as again lies because as the
riots over a kid getting shot or just,

2518
02:27:32,590 --> 02:27:36,830
I don't know, bank robberies aren't as
hot. It's a favor these days. Are they?

2519
02:27:36,831 --> 02:27:39,600
I don't know. It's weird. I think it's
way harder to rob a bank. I don't,

2520
02:27:39,601 --> 02:27:41,260
I don't think that happens all that often.

2521
02:27:41,800 --> 02:27:45,370
And the Lee Marie one was one
of the biggest ones ever. Yeah.

2522
02:27:45,430 --> 02:27:48,100
I mean him and his alleged compadres,

2523
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:50,680
I mean they heisted some
insane amount of money. Right.

2524
02:27:50,681 --> 02:27:54,550
It was a hundreds of millions
of dollars. Crazy amounts. Yeah.

2525
02:27:54,551 --> 02:27:58,860
That guys are crazy story, Huh? Yeah. How
much of a folk hero is he in England? No,

2526
02:27:59,530 --> 02:28:02,800
genuinely not that much joy. Again,
I heard about it more because of,

2527
02:28:02,850 --> 02:28:06,670
of I heard about that whole story more
because of who he is and because of his

2528
02:28:06,671 --> 02:28:09,490
father in Everett because of
mixed martial arts. Yeah. Hm.

2529
02:28:09,550 --> 02:28:12,180
So the other people that were involved,
how I became aware of it and again,

2530
02:28:12,181 --> 02:28:16,870
I can't say, I guess other people may
have been more aware for some reason,

2531
02:28:16,871 --> 02:28:21,740
but yeah, that's the main, that's how I
heard about the story more because of MMA.

2532
02:28:22,000 --> 02:28:23,710
Yeah.
He doesn't even seem like a real person,

2533
02:28:23,740 --> 02:28:25,330
like guy who fought as a high level.

2534
02:28:25,331 --> 02:28:30,160
I'm a May fighter got stabbed like
seven times and then one being involved,

2535
02:28:30,161 --> 02:28:32,580
one of the biggest bank robberies,
every second stories.

2536
02:28:32,590 --> 02:28:37,030
And he goes away to Morocco and he's in
prison and Morocco and just run and shit

2537
02:28:37,031 --> 02:28:41,770
over there. He's living over there for a
while and then eventually got arrested.

2538
02:28:41,780 --> 02:28:46,500
And where's he down in jail. Is he in
jail? The UK? I think so. Wow. He's a,

2539
02:28:46,690 --> 02:28:48,040
he's got a crazy life man.

2540
02:28:48,250 --> 02:28:50,920
Someone's going to take that guy's life
and turn it into like the most insane

2541
02:28:50,921 --> 02:28:54,610
Guy Ritchie movie ever. You know,
like it's just him narrating it.

2542
02:28:55,000 --> 02:28:55,833
It's going to eat

2543
02:28:55,930 --> 02:28:58,630
w w I want him to Ryan
because it's all just there.

2544
02:28:58,710 --> 02:29:00,810
It's just literally tell you yes

2545
02:29:00,840 --> 02:29:05,790
stories. England has a lot of violence.
We'll Bullock fisticuffs. Yeah, that's,

2546
02:29:05,791 --> 02:29:08,070
that's something that I've found
like shocking when I was there.

2547
02:29:08,071 --> 02:29:10,530
How often you see guys
duking it out in the street?

2548
02:29:10,810 --> 02:29:14,550
It's a weird one. I'm a,
I'm a, I'm a Millwall fan,

2549
02:29:14,551 --> 02:29:18,150
which is a football team over there
and we're known for having a lot of

2550
02:29:18,210 --> 02:29:22,560
hooligans and violence of writing and
they're known as the worst of the lot

2551
02:29:22,561 --> 02:29:23,920
coming. But again, it's,

2552
02:29:23,930 --> 02:29:28,930
so my opinion is that's not exclusive
to football really in the UK,

2553
02:29:29,371 --> 02:29:33,750
if you're on an generally on a Saturday
night, if you're in a busy town center,

2554
02:29:33,751 --> 02:29:38,580
you can see a front if someone,
so it's gonna cause we drink so heavily,

2555
02:29:40,260 --> 02:29:43,800
Doug's then hope a great bit about Helen
England to just fight about everything.

2556
02:29:43,801 --> 02:29:47,150
Where are you from over here?
Fuck over there.

2557
02:29:47,370 --> 02:29:48,510
That's exactly right.

2558
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:54,380
It is. It's just such a strange
thing. Do you think, I wonder if,

2559
02:29:54,381 --> 02:29:57,680
how much of that is
related to the fact that,

2560
02:29:58,050 --> 02:30:01,670
I mean his direct descendants, when
you're in Europe, there's no clean break.

2561
02:30:01,671 --> 02:30:05,780
It's not like your family comes over
to a new continent, forms a, you know,

2562
02:30:05,781 --> 02:30:07,780
a new civilization and starts fresh.
No,

2563
02:30:07,800 --> 02:30:11,330
you're essentially riding on the
momentum of King George. You know,

2564
02:30:11,331 --> 02:30:15,140
it's like the same, you know, like
the society has moved and progressed

2565
02:30:15,240 --> 02:30:20,130
tiny little island. But we've got this
and you used to be a massive empire. Yeah.

2566
02:30:20,960 --> 02:30:23,270
You know, affect things, right.

2567
02:30:23,271 --> 02:30:26,990
Our whole history is running
so much of the world.

2568
02:30:27,170 --> 02:30:31,220
And then we're on this tiny little island
still claiming that we're the mighty

2569
02:30:31,230 --> 02:30:32,063
England,

2570
02:30:32,720 --> 02:30:36,440
but we just scrapping in the
streets amongst ourselves.

2571
02:30:36,510 --> 02:30:40,560
Isn't it weird how civilizations do that?
Like the culture is like rise and fall,

2572
02:30:40,561 --> 02:30:45,300
rise and fall and their influence and
their power. You know, Rome go to Rome,

2573
02:30:45,330 --> 02:30:48,810
man, shit there. Nothing's going
on. I go buy a pizza. I mean,

2574
02:30:48,811 --> 02:30:49,980
what are you going to
get when you go to Rome?

2575
02:30:49,981 --> 02:30:52,590
You're not gonna see any just
giant armies. They had any,

2576
02:30:53,120 --> 02:30:58,010
it's the weird delusional in Britain. I
have a history and an arrogance in a way.

2577
02:30:58,340 --> 02:31:01,760
90% of the stuff that we got that
was good was from the Romans.

2578
02:31:01,790 --> 02:31:05,780
The Romans came and showed us and the
reason a lot of our society crumbled after

2579
02:31:05,781 --> 02:31:08,270
the Romans left was because we had all
these amazing roads and everything,

2580
02:31:08,600 --> 02:31:12,560
but we didn't know how to rebuild them
all to maintain them or anything like

2581
02:31:12,561 --> 02:31:12,741
that.

2582
02:31:12,741 --> 02:31:17,630
So we kind of had this big boom when the
Romans came over and then plummeted for

2583
02:31:17,631 --> 02:31:19,710
ages because we're like,
oh shit,

2584
02:31:20,040 --> 02:31:23,450
we've got all this technology and what
not and we don't really know how to fix

2585
02:31:23,451 --> 02:31:23,551
that.

2586
02:31:23,551 --> 02:31:27,900
Some other guys made it and then they
went broken it to go home cause they got

2587
02:31:27,901 --> 02:31:30,780
overthrown and we were
there like, ah, fuck.

2588
02:31:30,990 --> 02:31:35,010
And then years later he was then turned
into accurate history and our great

2589
02:31:35,310 --> 02:31:36,800
advances in technology and

2590
02:31:36,900 --> 02:31:38,910
yeah, it comes in waves, right? Yeah.

2591
02:31:39,330 --> 02:31:42,420
Like guys figured it out
and then something happens.

2592
02:31:42,430 --> 02:31:46,600
Then the new people have to
reinvent and yeah, that's a,

2593
02:31:46,601 --> 02:31:48,330
it's just such a fascinating thing.

2594
02:31:48,360 --> 02:31:50,550
It's such a fascinating thing when
you go to Europe and you see how old

2595
02:31:50,551 --> 02:31:54,450
everything is. Yeah. It really puts into
perspective because, uh, when I was a kid,

2596
02:31:54,451 --> 02:31:58,890
I lived in Boston and uh, there
was a cemetery, uh, near, uh,

2597
02:31:58,891 --> 02:32:00,480
the Commons and uh,

2598
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:04,350
it's like one of the oldest cemeteries
in the country and you like see like a

2599
02:32:04,470 --> 02:32:07,650
headstone from like the 17 hundreds
or 1600. So that's a big deal.

2600
02:32:08,370 --> 02:32:12,570
But in comparison to the European history,
like they have that big,

2601
02:32:13,050 --> 02:32:15,750
big white horse that's
on the side of a hill.

2602
02:32:16,090 --> 02:32:18,500
Yeah, yeah, yeah. And nobody
fucking knows where it came from.

2603
02:32:18,680 --> 02:32:20,720
Nobody has a god car wash,
stuff like that.

2604
02:32:20,780 --> 02:32:23,860
And just things like stone
Henge and all that kind of just,

2605
02:32:23,950 --> 02:32:26,690
it's just crazy how old that,
and again,

2606
02:32:26,691 --> 02:32:31,010
really it's not that impressive.
It's a load of slabs. It's some shit,

2607
02:32:31,011 --> 02:32:34,280
but it's the fact that
this is, yeah, so old.

2608
02:32:34,310 --> 02:32:37,550
Thousands of years ago as
well and no, Whoa, whoa. Yeah.

2609
02:32:37,560 --> 02:32:40,130
They like to bait the purpose
of like they find roads,

2610
02:32:40,280 --> 02:32:43,010
these crazy stone roads and like, okay,
what the fuck? What's going on here?

2611
02:32:43,011 --> 02:32:45,230
No one knows. Everyone
forgot. It's all just gone.

2612
02:32:45,231 --> 02:32:49,330
Whole civilization comes and goes and
it's a beautiful thing though, man. It's,

2613
02:32:49,340 --> 02:32:53,240
it's an amazing thing to discover the
remnants of the past and try to piece

2614
02:32:53,241 --> 02:32:58,040
together what happened and then really
try to put it into perspective what has

2615
02:32:58,041 --> 02:33:02,390
happened that brought us to 2014 all the
different lives that had to be lived,

2616
02:33:02,391 --> 02:33:03,920
all the events that had to take place.

2617
02:33:04,190 --> 02:33:07,100
And all the different things that we're
trying to still piece together today and

2618
02:33:07,101 --> 02:33:10,660
try to figure out, well what, what was
going on? What did they believe on,

2619
02:33:10,820 --> 02:33:14,120
why would they worshiping cows and where
were they doing on top of this hill and

2620
02:33:14,390 --> 02:33:17,990
what was this, why they set this
up to align it with constellations?

2621
02:33:17,991 --> 02:33:21,110
Like what was their belief system?
They wrote like this,

2622
02:33:21,260 --> 02:33:24,790
what the fuck they got these little
squiggly lines. What are they saying?

2623
02:33:24,970 --> 02:33:29,360
Crazy to think of the level of
intelligence that was around

2624
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:33,860
before the breakthrough was made to
record that and to document that.

2625
02:33:33,861 --> 02:33:34,820
So just so much stuff.

2626
02:33:34,821 --> 02:33:38,450
Just amazing shit that probably they all
knew what these stones before everyone

2627
02:33:38,451 --> 02:33:40,850
knew what the fuck it was full,
but that wasn't,

2628
02:33:41,150 --> 02:33:45,280
that wasn't written down anywhere. We're
not going to forget that we come home.

2629
02:33:45,281 --> 02:33:47,570
We spend so much time
building this as Donald's.

2630
02:33:47,570 --> 02:33:50,420
Everyone knows what the stones or the
WHO does this tone and everybody knows

2631
02:33:50,421 --> 02:33:52,520
what's done in just for,
yeah.

2632
02:33:52,521 --> 02:33:55,160
I wonder when the first guy
started writing shit down,

2633
02:33:55,190 --> 02:33:58,490
everybody else was like probably like,
what the fuck are you doing? He's like,

2634
02:33:58,491 --> 02:34:01,160
I wrote a language like I'm not learning
your shit. I got my own language,

2635
02:34:01,550 --> 02:34:04,580
my language is involved. Just circle
solve a big circles and little circle.

2636
02:34:04,820 --> 02:34:08,180
Big circles or means I'm really mad.
Little circles mean them happy. Okay.

2637
02:34:08,220 --> 02:34:09,260
Big Circle.
A little circle.

2638
02:34:10,130 --> 02:34:12,380
You had to get a bunch of people to
agree like you had to get a bunch of

2639
02:34:12,381 --> 02:34:13,870
scholars,
many generations.

2640
02:34:15,590 --> 02:34:19,990
How many generations is the tech to
figure that out imaginable and then

2641
02:34:19,991 --> 02:34:20,351
someone's like,

2642
02:34:20,351 --> 02:34:23,230
I'm going to write it on our cylinder
and I'm going to roll it on clay.

2643
02:34:23,231 --> 02:34:26,830
Do you get to know what I mean? Like
what I'm, how fucked up is it that I,

2644
02:34:26,900 --> 02:34:31,150
when I then go and find another society
that got at completely different,

2645
02:34:31,440 --> 02:34:33,400
no correlation at all.

2646
02:34:33,401 --> 02:34:36,300
So not only have you got to figure out
this completely new way of communicating,

2647
02:34:36,310 --> 02:34:40,090
you've got to then interpret
their way into yours.

2648
02:34:41,590 --> 02:34:45,740
It's too crazy. Just
the idea. Oh, how much,

2649
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:48,070
how Craig look when,

2650
02:34:48,130 --> 02:34:53,080
when you think about like
Columbus in 1492 sailing off,

2651
02:34:53,230 --> 02:34:56,370
finding the Americas landing here,
seeing the native people,

2652
02:34:56,380 --> 02:34:57,580
trying to communicate with them.

2653
02:34:57,581 --> 02:35:01,600
Like what that must have been like not
even knowing where the fuck you landed.

2654
02:35:01,960 --> 02:35:05,550
You get there and you see some people
and they're all brown and Shit and they

2655
02:35:05,551 --> 02:35:08,950
got feathers in their head and
like what is going on? Cause they,

2656
02:35:08,960 --> 02:35:13,900
how do I tell this guy that
I'm from Spain? Like what
do I, you know what, what?

2657
02:35:13,910 --> 02:35:14,890
What is he saying?

2658
02:35:15,070 --> 02:35:18,850
Like you had to decipher a language that
no one even knew existed and there's a

2659
02:35:18,851 --> 02:35:22,780
gang of them. You got the
Lakota people who speak one way.

2660
02:35:22,781 --> 02:35:24,460
You get the Cherokee
that speak another way.

2661
02:35:24,461 --> 02:35:28,170
You get the Apache that have
their own way. Yeah. Pool.

2662
02:35:28,930 --> 02:35:30,790
That's the only 200 years ago,
you know,

2663
02:35:30,791 --> 02:35:35,791
400 500 years or whatever it was from
1492 to 2012 I mean think about like when

2664
02:35:37,271 --> 02:35:38,930
they came here,
the,

2665
02:35:38,940 --> 02:35:43,750
the amount of time between
1492 the less than 600 years,

2666
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:48,640
500 plus years to today.
That's nothing in terms of the world.

2667
02:35:48,760 --> 02:35:50,440
Nothing.
But in that time,

2668
02:35:50,590 --> 02:35:55,200
this one spot with a bunch of people on
horses just hanging out, just erupted,

2669
02:35:55,210 --> 02:35:59,050
became a New York City, San Francisco,
California. Last time I was here,

2670
02:35:59,260 --> 02:36:01,810
I can't remember what it was, but someone
was telling me how long ago it was.

2671
02:36:01,811 --> 02:36:06,640
The La was part of Mexico. 18
hundreds it's not. Yes. Yeah.

2672
02:36:06,880 --> 02:36:11,410
Not that ago one. Okay.
When was la? Mexico?

2673
02:36:11,650 --> 02:36:15,030
I say it was,
I say 1800.

2674
02:36:15,080 --> 02:36:19,120
That really could be wrong. I could be
remembering it wrong. But Brian, you,

2675
02:36:19,121 --> 02:36:23,010
Dayton a Mexican. I was at a Mexican
last night, but if you do you to ask,

2676
02:36:23,910 --> 02:36:25,900
have you had a guess?
When was la?

2677
02:36:25,930 --> 02:36:30,880
Mexico 1821 [inaudible] 27.

2678
02:36:31,810 --> 02:36:35,890
Okay. When was la? Mexico. Hmm?

2679
02:36:36,970 --> 02:36:40,960
When did la belonged to
Mexico. Okay. When did did,

2680
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:46,720
it's the anticipation now
and now it's building.

2681
02:36:46,721 --> 02:36:50,860
I'm saying more recently than that. You
saying, I don't know. I don't want to,

2682
02:36:52,010 --> 02:36:56,890
uh, 1769. Oh, really? 1769.
Thanks. So hold on a second.

2683
02:36:57,220 --> 02:37:01,180
European exportation period from 1542
to 76, nine, seven. Oh, no, no, no.

2684
02:37:01,220 --> 02:37:05,320
I'm [inaudible], um,
Mexican beer at 1821 1848.

2685
02:37:05,560 --> 02:37:10,150
The United States State Hood, dude,
that she continues to the present day.

2686
02:37:10,151 --> 02:37:14,110
1821 I guessed it. Date. Yeah.
That's amazing. You probably,

2687
02:37:14,350 --> 02:37:16,070
do you think maybe you
had that in your head

2688
02:37:16,220 --> 02:37:16,910
as you knew

2689
02:37:16,910 --> 02:37:19,770
I got a little Mexican juice on me.
Maybe.

2690
02:37:21,770 --> 02:37:26,100
Do you think that maybe you saw that?
So it's a crazy number 1821.

2691
02:37:26,340 --> 02:37:29,730
It is a real, incredibly specific, yeah,
it's really specific, but you got it.

2692
02:37:30,000 --> 02:37:31,620
But it's also,
I've seen those tee shirts.

2693
02:37:31,650 --> 02:37:33,270
That's one thing to
take into consideration.

2694
02:37:33,271 --> 02:37:37,470
They have a t shirt that says 1881 to
2014 be a lot of people where it's,

2695
02:37:37,940 --> 02:37:41,610
you know, I was like, there's birth tee
shirt. I've seen him like different years.

2696
02:37:43,360 --> 02:37:45,220
One day. I have no
idea. I've never of that

2697
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:47,410
good memory though. Whatever
it is. You're right.

2698
02:37:47,540 --> 02:37:50,580
Actually, I didn't even know that Mexican
and the United States was in the same

2699
02:37:50,630 --> 02:37:54,200
different tribes of native
native Americans have lived
in the area that is now

2700
02:37:54,201 --> 02:37:58,100
California for an estimated
13 to 15,000 years.

2701
02:37:58,490 --> 02:38:01,790
Holy Shit, man. Holy Shit.

2702
02:38:03,530 --> 02:38:07,880
Wow. During the pre European, uh, period,

2703
02:38:08,240 --> 02:38:12,200
there was only a between a hundred
and 300,000 native Americans living in

2704
02:38:12,201 --> 02:38:17,000
California. Wow. There's no
one here is crazy. Just empty.

2705
02:38:17,180 --> 02:38:17,990
Isn't that weird?

2706
02:38:17,990 --> 02:38:22,990
300,000 is not answer those questions
when he's saying it's probably an amazing,

2707
02:38:24,230 --> 02:38:27,590
I mean, look, it's probably
a hard life even back then,

2708
02:38:27,620 --> 02:38:31,190
but how amazing must've been
to be on horseback and shit.

2709
02:38:31,191 --> 02:38:34,760
300,000 people here. Well,
actually pre European.

2710
02:38:35,090 --> 02:38:37,810
The problem with that is pre European.
Um,

2711
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:41,570
I don't think they were on horses at all.
The, the horses came from the Europeans,

2712
02:38:41,571 --> 02:38:43,970
I'm pretty sure. Yeah.
They're riding horses.

2713
02:38:43,971 --> 02:38:48,050
Like that was one of the things like
where Cortez showed up and Montezuma's

2714
02:38:48,051 --> 02:38:51,550
people like what the fuck these guys are
gods because they were on horses that

2715
02:38:51,690 --> 02:38:55,910
they were parked. Yeah, yeah.
Of, of, of the hosts. Yeah.

2716
02:38:55,970 --> 02:38:59,690
Fascinating shit man.
1821 that is not that long ago.

2717
02:39:00,980 --> 02:39:04,250
Less than 200 years ago. This was
Mexico. And wonder why Mexicans get mad.

2718
02:39:05,120 --> 02:39:06,110
That shit's really recent.

2719
02:39:06,170 --> 02:39:11,140
It's last life if you don't have
that many generations either. No,

2720
02:39:11,300 --> 02:39:15,820
not at all. That's not that many at all.
This like great, great grandparents.

2721
02:39:16,140 --> 02:39:18,650
I can almost remember
that shit. Yeah. Wow.

2722
02:39:18,720 --> 02:39:21,020
I think I saw somewhere the
other day that Columbus,

2723
02:39:21,021 --> 02:39:25,070
Ohio now has a bigger population
of Mexicans than white people,

2724
02:39:25,400 --> 02:39:29,570
I think is what, I'll double check on
that, but Columbus, Ohio, and we just,

2725
02:39:29,590 --> 02:39:34,100
I remember when I lived there just some
10 or 11 years ago, it was like I saw,

2726
02:39:34,130 --> 02:39:37,460
I remember seeing the first Mexican. I
remember like, what's that? You know,

2727
02:39:37,461 --> 02:39:38,750
and my mom's like,
that's a Mexican.

2728
02:39:39,120 --> 02:39:42,270
Everyday I'm hustling everyday.
I'm hustling.

2729
02:39:42,300 --> 02:39:44,670
They figured out a way
to just fucking hustles.

2730
02:39:44,700 --> 02:39:45,960
They've got all the way up to Columbus,

2731
02:39:45,961 --> 02:39:49,560
like these fucking chubby white people
aren't working. Let's go take their jobs,

2732
02:39:49,830 --> 02:39:52,380
kick some ass, take some names.
I'll take five jobs, please.

2733
02:39:52,381 --> 02:39:55,500
We're all living in a one bedroom
apartment, saving money, boom.

2734
02:39:55,530 --> 02:39:58,590
Next thing you know, they're opening up
a taco joint. Best Tacos in Columbus.

2735
02:39:58,980 --> 02:40:00,990
Dude's not even legal.
And it's like,

2736
02:40:01,570 --> 02:40:04,680
it's fine if there's two taco places in
town and one of them was a dude that's

2737
02:40:04,681 --> 02:40:07,020
not even legal. I'm going
to that guy's place. Yeah.

2738
02:40:07,170 --> 02:40:11,070
He's bringing over goats and shit service.
Some nasty,

2739
02:40:11,071 --> 02:40:14,070
vicious Jalapenos.
That one place man in

2740
02:40:14,070 --> 02:40:16,830
La Jolla across the street from the condo.
What's that place called?

2741
02:40:17,310 --> 02:40:21,860
Shade asked me too fast.
Deep Bob's Burrito,

2742
02:40:22,460 --> 02:40:26,040
Don's Don,
whatever it is.

2743
02:40:26,790 --> 02:40:30,720
It's so close to Mexico.
It's just the most authentic,

2744
02:40:31,050 --> 02:40:34,800
the most ridiculously good burrito's
you'll ever have in your life by design.

2745
02:40:34,980 --> 02:40:38,010
And it's in San Diego, so it's like
real close to the actual Mexico.

2746
02:40:38,011 --> 02:40:42,270
You can't play Don Lucas, Don Lucas,
you can't play when you're in San Diego.

2747
02:40:42,271 --> 02:40:44,310
You can't have some shitty Mexican food.
Mexico's right.

2748
02:40:44,320 --> 02:40:49,290
They're literally on the doorstep.
Yeah. It's a weird moment,

2749
02:40:49,291 --> 02:40:51,270
man. When you have um, you know,

2750
02:40:51,420 --> 02:40:54,960
this incredible community
like La Jolla and on this uh,

2751
02:40:54,990 --> 02:40:58,560
like really rich area. Yeah.
Beautiful, beautiful era. And then

2752
02:40:58,720 --> 02:41:00,390
20 minute drive,
Tijuana,

2753
02:41:01,150 --> 02:41:05,530
20 minute drive, like a complete different
country, you know, wrecked with poverty,

2754
02:41:05,770 --> 02:41:07,060
drug violence,
crazy.

2755
02:41:07,900 --> 02:41:12,900
Turn it around Europe are realizing how
many countries you can cover in a few

2756
02:41:13,340 --> 02:41:15,300
hours drive.
I mean,

2757
02:41:15,730 --> 02:41:19,820
that's insane that you're driving through
Germany to France, to Holland, to Italy.

2758
02:41:20,450 --> 02:41:24,280
All of these, uh, uh, uh, uh,
within a day kind of thing is,

2759
02:41:24,860 --> 02:41:28,700
but you're in a completely different
country and culture, language, everything.

2760
02:41:29,830 --> 02:41:34,040
Yeah. I, you guys can go to
France and Germany and Hungary.

2761
02:41:34,220 --> 02:41:37,850
Like how many different places can you
leave in England and get two in one day

2762
02:41:39,230 --> 02:41:43,940
and sign them out and sign it if you
literally drive in through or drive. Yeah.

2763
02:41:43,950 --> 02:41:47,930
This, so many. And they all say how
many of them speak different languages?

2764
02:41:48,410 --> 02:41:49,243
All of them.

2765
02:41:49,570 --> 02:41:51,220
All of them.
It's crazy.

2766
02:41:51,221 --> 02:41:54,910
They're like across the board from each
other and completely different languages.

2767
02:41:54,940 --> 02:41:58,600
But most of them speak English as
well. Yeah. Yeah. When you get respect,

2768
02:41:58,640 --> 02:41:59,500
when you're doing gigs,

2769
02:41:59,501 --> 02:42:01,930
do you do gigs in all these
countries and do English gigs?

2770
02:42:02,020 --> 02:42:03,900
Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. It was,

2771
02:42:04,530 --> 02:42:08,290
it was crazy because obviously
it's quite a lyric based.

2772
02:42:08,530 --> 02:42:11,690
We assumed when we first started
going out there that that,

2773
02:42:12,300 --> 02:42:16,090
that they wouldn't really get that side
of it. But it's crazy how in Europe,

2774
02:42:16,120 --> 02:42:21,120
a lot of people seem to get
it more because they read
the translations of it and

2775
02:42:21,681 --> 02:42:23,040
a paying attention, more
of, you know, it means,

2776
02:42:23,060 --> 02:42:26,230
so if you're hearing it and you speak
English, you're going to miss tons of it,

2777
02:42:26,260 --> 02:42:28,220
but you're just, you're
picking up enough. Whereas,

2778
02:42:28,270 --> 02:42:33,270
cause they're not picking up any other
than go and read the a word for word and

2779
02:42:33,881 --> 02:42:37,030
understand it far more than half of the
British people who come to our shows and

2780
02:42:37,031 --> 02:42:40,750
stuff like that.
That's kind of cool because it's all fast.

2781
02:42:40,751 --> 02:42:44,530
So if you're like, oh, this is
my language, then you won't get,

2782
02:42:44,531 --> 02:42:46,720
there's tons of hip hop songs.
I don't know half of it,

2783
02:42:46,721 --> 02:42:49,450
but I've listened to it a
million times and you just, yeah,

2784
02:42:49,930 --> 02:42:52,170
yeah.
Like doing that as an APP,

2785
02:42:52,230 --> 02:42:54,900
releasing it as an APP and
having all your lyrics.

2786
02:42:55,100 --> 02:42:57,500
Well, the lyrics on there now, that
could be good that way. I mean,

2787
02:42:57,501 --> 02:43:02,150
I've always been adamant of putting it in,
in the booklet and shit like that.

2788
02:43:02,151 --> 02:43:06,650
I've always been adamant on the packaging,
always having or being good.

2789
02:43:06,651 --> 02:43:10,430
I like physical stuff. Obviously
I'm adapting to the digital stuff,

2790
02:43:10,431 --> 02:43:15,431
but I like to put out a nice
f f a physical product as
well with all the lyrics

2791
02:43:15,611 --> 02:43:17,470
in,
and then I kind of sit there,

2792
02:43:17,471 --> 02:43:20,310
we'll kind of snotty on online when
people ask me the lyrics, it's like, Whoa,

2793
02:43:20,780 --> 02:43:24,370
you'd bought the CD then? Yeah. Just going
to buy the album. You'll find the APP.

2794
02:43:24,610 --> 02:43:27,400
Yeah. It's like, do you get upset
with people? Bootlegger shit,

2795
02:43:28,800 --> 02:43:31,390
I get upset that there's no shame over it.

2796
02:43:32,840 --> 02:43:35,980
And that kills me now that people
openly just tweet, you're going, yeah,

2797
02:43:35,981 --> 02:43:38,500
I stole that. It's like, cool,
I understand that that happens,

2798
02:43:38,501 --> 02:43:42,130
but don't come to my face and told me
that cause these are released most of it

2799
02:43:42,131 --> 02:43:43,810
on my own label now and stuff like that.
It's just like,

2800
02:43:44,020 --> 02:43:47,650
you're not ripping anyone
off other than me. Um, yeah.

2801
02:43:47,770 --> 02:43:49,480
But do you feel like,
um,

2802
02:43:49,510 --> 02:43:53,440
there's a balance with people finding
out about your stuff because someone will

2803
02:43:53,441 --> 02:43:55,010
take it and download it and then they'll,

2804
02:43:55,090 --> 02:43:57,440
they'll distribute it and then
other people find out about them,

2805
02:43:57,490 --> 02:43:58,720
more people come to your shows?

2806
02:43:59,140 --> 02:44:03,490
I think we completely is. I think,
um, yeah, it's, it's all a kind of is,

2807
02:44:03,580 --> 02:44:05,250
it's all interwoven.

2808
02:44:05,270 --> 02:44:10,270
But I think people often argue are so I
stole your music but I paid to come to

2809
02:44:10,551 --> 02:44:14,990
see you live. It's like, yeah, not
performed live for you. Right, right.

2810
02:44:15,020 --> 02:44:17,870
That's what you were paying for this
gentlemen. That doesn't say that.

2811
02:44:17,871 --> 02:44:20,600
That doesn't cover the
receiving almost this,

2812
02:44:20,650 --> 02:44:22,880
it's like if you're going to do it yet,
it might find,

2813
02:44:22,930 --> 02:44:25,700
you might hear some and have some new
listeners cause he told somebody but don't

2814
02:44:25,701 --> 02:44:28,670
go to your, like you say, go
to your face and it's such,

2815
02:44:28,671 --> 02:44:32,020
I find it's such a weird
argument the saying, um,

2816
02:44:32,720 --> 02:44:35,780
saying I stole this bar, I
paid for this. When you're the,

2817
02:44:35,870 --> 02:44:37,490
you're paying for has
its own value anyway.

2818
02:44:37,491 --> 02:44:40,370
It's like saying I'm not going
to pay you at work this week,

2819
02:44:40,371 --> 02:44:44,480
but I paid you for the last
three weeks so, so we're cool.

2820
02:44:44,990 --> 02:44:49,640
So no, we're not cool. This
is for this, this word. Right,
right, right, right, right.

2821
02:44:49,690 --> 02:44:49,930
No,

2822
02:44:49,930 --> 02:44:54,930
I do a lot to try and cause make it
engaging and my people want to pay on my

2823
02:44:55,221 --> 02:44:58,820
solo album. I released a fake
tolerant that was all this, oh,

2824
02:44:58,821 --> 02:44:59,654
the instrument or was,

2825
02:44:59,900 --> 02:45:04,520
but me just talking and just chatting and
doing kind of a DVD extras kind of, oh,

2826
02:45:04,700 --> 02:45:08,060
the drummer on this track was with Travis
Barker and shit and shit like that.

2827
02:45:08,061 --> 02:45:11,260
And going through stuff just so that
the Torah, and that was first out.

2828
02:45:11,261 --> 02:45:13,550
Then everyone grabbed,
it wasn't at the hour,

2829
02:45:13,560 --> 02:45:16,670
but then it also kind of not
in a preachy way, kind of said,

2830
02:45:18,350 --> 02:45:20,780
if you're stealing it, you're
stealing it from, from me,

2831
02:45:20,781 --> 02:45:24,950
from the artists that you're into
and support in this light. So yeah.

2832
02:45:24,951 --> 02:45:27,470
And that kind of works. A lot of
people say, ah Shit, I got caught.

2833
02:45:27,920 --> 02:45:31,850
I got caught on the fake terror. And
that's interesting that, you know,

2834
02:45:31,970 --> 02:45:35,910
I try a lot to try and be, yeah, try
and make things interesting in that way.

2835
02:45:35,911 --> 02:45:37,490
Because again, if people are gonna
steal, they're going to steal.

2836
02:45:37,491 --> 02:45:40,930
But we get an awful lot of people who say,
I've not paid for an hour,

2837
02:45:40,950 --> 02:45:44,610
been in ages, but I paid for
your album because of, yeah.

2838
02:45:44,690 --> 02:45:48,140
The way it's all coming from a personal
perspective. Right. Because it's

2839
02:45:48,320 --> 02:45:52,310
someone directly you release it. Yeah.
Yeah. That's kind of, you know, there's,

2840
02:45:52,311 --> 02:45:56,320
there's a lot of things that people don't
want to pay for online. Yeah. You know,

2841
02:45:56,321 --> 02:45:59,240
and once they start being able to
get things for free, they don't,

2842
02:45:59,270 --> 02:46:00,260
they don't want to pay for them.

2843
02:46:00,330 --> 02:46:03,510
It's finding the balance and,
and the sweet spot,

2844
02:46:03,511 --> 02:46:07,290
I've just released my spoken word show,
Edinburgh fringe,

2845
02:46:07,291 --> 02:46:08,250
so it's kind of spoken word,

2846
02:46:08,251 --> 02:46:10,190
but then have some stand in
there as well kind of thing.

2847
02:46:10,670 --> 02:46:14,750
And it stunned me that the comedy world,

2848
02:46:16,160 --> 02:46:20,660
Louie and yourself and everyone had found
that thing of putting out for $5 and

2849
02:46:20,661 --> 02:46:25,661
being direct to the customer for $5 is
enough for you to not want to go on a

2850
02:46:27,171 --> 02:46:28,340
torrent site and hunted down.

2851
02:46:28,341 --> 02:46:30,950
It seems to be that sweet spot
that people will be happy to pay.

2852
02:46:31,270 --> 02:46:35,410
Yet the music industry hasn't
done that. It's a, for my shower,

2853
02:46:35,420 --> 02:46:38,420
I've done that and released it in that
way. And again, it seems to be working.

2854
02:46:38,421 --> 02:46:41,570
People are kind of I that people like you,

2855
02:46:41,571 --> 02:46:43,850
they'll buy it and if
they wouldn't buy it,

2856
02:46:44,070 --> 02:46:46,820
they would probably never going to buy
it anyway. And if they download it,

2857
02:46:46,821 --> 02:46:48,470
you'll get more people downloading it.

2858
02:46:48,471 --> 02:46:51,620
So I don't know how many people
have illegally downloaded my shit,

2859
02:46:51,621 --> 02:46:54,740
but a lot of people have bought it,
so it's, I think it all worked out.

2860
02:46:54,770 --> 02:46:58,700
I just think it works out spreads the
word, but it again, again, it's not,

2861
02:46:58,701 --> 02:47:01,970
I'm completely, I finding that's the
way things go long. I started off,

2862
02:47:02,300 --> 02:47:05,150
I think you've got to do a
certain amount of free stuff.

2863
02:47:05,151 --> 02:47:06,660
I think that's totally key.

2864
02:47:06,770 --> 02:47:11,360
You need to be giving away stuff for free
and engage in and building that crowd

2865
02:47:11,450 --> 02:47:15,500
so that hopefully when you do have stuff
for sale, yeah, people will pay well.

2866
02:47:15,501 --> 02:47:17,150
I think that definitely makes it a better,

2867
02:47:17,151 --> 02:47:21,140
better relationship than if everything
you do is just for sale. Yeah. You know,

2868
02:47:21,141 --> 02:47:25,700
I think when you give people stuff for
free, I mean certainly like a podcast.

2869
02:47:25,701 --> 02:47:28,400
Have you ever thought about
doing something like a
podcast? I'm tempted. I've,

2870
02:47:28,401 --> 02:47:33,230
I've, I've had a ride Ayrshire in the, in
the UK for the last, uh, year and a half.

2871
02:47:33,231 --> 02:47:36,650
I've just stopped that
now for a bit of a break,

2872
02:47:36,651 --> 02:47:40,160
but I'm considering going the podcast
route instead. Yeah, why not? I mean,

2873
02:47:40,161 --> 02:47:41,450
when you have a radio show,

2874
02:47:41,690 --> 02:47:44,240
the thing about it is you're always
going to be working for somebody.

2875
02:47:44,320 --> 02:47:48,050
You're always going to be
uploading something if someone
else's servers and they

2876
02:47:48,051 --> 02:47:50,510
have to decide whether or not
unscrupulous is getting crazy.

2877
02:47:50,511 --> 02:47:52,850
This motherfucker saying some
shit that I don't agree with.

2878
02:47:52,851 --> 02:47:55,130
We're going to have to remove
them from [inaudible]. Exactly.

2879
02:47:55,131 --> 02:47:58,880
That kind of just being your
own boss on that is. Yeah.

2880
02:47:58,881 --> 02:48:01,610
And much like you do with
your spoken word stuff,

2881
02:48:01,640 --> 02:48:03,700
you're the creator of this stuff.
You know,

2882
02:48:04,100 --> 02:48:06,150
you'd be the creator of
your own podcast too. Yeah,

2883
02:48:06,530 --> 02:48:10,130
I think I've completely forgot that I had,

2884
02:48:10,131 --> 02:48:13,250
and refinish thing I mentioned
is six filters on my website,

2885
02:48:13,251 --> 02:48:18,080
but if you went to the codeword Rogan
is $5 at the moment. So you know, I've,

2886
02:48:18,081 --> 02:48:20,390
I've, I've, I've, I've seen
your adverts and know it works.

2887
02:48:20,400 --> 02:48:25,100
I know how to when people open,
so scrupulous pip.co. Dot. UK.

2888
02:48:25,340 --> 02:48:29,690
Oh, there you go. Dot. Broken UK.
Yeah. Okay, cool. Awesome man.

2889
02:48:29,810 --> 02:48:31,460
I forgot about that.
I saw at that four came in.

2890
02:48:32,450 --> 02:48:34,130
What are you doing over
in America right now I'm,

2891
02:48:34,131 --> 02:48:36,410
I'm working on a new solo album,

2892
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:41,150
so I'm working on that with a Travis
Barker again at that Ilona from nine inch

2893
02:48:41,151 --> 02:48:45,380
nails. Don't wait for those with Eddie
Bravo. Yeah, Eddie was over last night.

2894
02:48:45,381 --> 02:48:47,570
He's Travis seems like a cool guy.
I've never met him,

2895
02:48:47,571 --> 02:48:50,780
but we've gone back and forth online.
I've communicated with the season.

2896
02:48:51,280 --> 02:48:54,170
The last time I was over here and
again, he's fucking, he's huge.

2897
02:48:54,200 --> 02:48:58,340
He doesn't need to give anyone would be
nice. Yeah. I came over and he was just,

2898
02:48:58,760 --> 02:49:03,760
he gave us about two hours in his studio
of just him playing dramas and for the

2899
02:49:04,521 --> 02:49:07,760
record was like a dream,
a dream anymore and just to just,

2900
02:49:08,580 --> 02:49:10,800
we chatted online and he played
on a track I've done previously,

2901
02:49:10,801 --> 02:49:14,430
but it was all over emails and just
the most accommodating and nice go on.

2902
02:49:14,431 --> 02:49:17,910
It's like, well, you don't have to be
this guy. You could be a complete Dick.

2903
02:49:17,911 --> 02:49:20,920
He Kit. But he's, yeah, just played for
hours and literally as soon as I left,

2904
02:49:20,921 --> 02:49:25,170
I had a message from him saying, you need
anymore. Just let me know if you know,

2905
02:49:25,171 --> 02:49:27,980
if you're in town. Oh cool. Great.

2906
02:49:28,200 --> 02:49:31,800
Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, he's about as
big as it gets it. It comes to drummers.

2907
02:49:31,860 --> 02:49:32,190
Yeah.

2908
02:49:32,190 --> 02:49:35,820
Does that guy have any room for tattoos
or is he just like completely filled up?

2909
02:49:36,270 --> 02:49:41,250
He still seems to be having them all
the time, but [inaudible] tattoos.

2910
02:49:41,280 --> 02:49:44,850
Yeah. Yeah. He's got no room, man.
It's a, I liked that too though.

2911
02:49:44,851 --> 02:49:48,240
He does a lot of martial arts
training too. Does is a place, yeah.

2912
02:49:48,370 --> 02:49:51,450
A place near here that he,
we started talking was, was

2913
02:49:51,570 --> 02:49:54,470
us talking about a UFC
events and epics and that,

2914
02:49:54,471 --> 02:49:57,380
that's kind of how we got to get
to know each other, so, yeah.

2915
02:49:57,480 --> 02:49:58,171
Yeah.
He loves it.

2916
02:49:58,171 --> 02:50:01,980
I'm just saying he's a big MMA fan and
he's always tweeting about and stuff.

2917
02:50:02,370 --> 02:50:05,250
That's cool, man. So listen, we're,
