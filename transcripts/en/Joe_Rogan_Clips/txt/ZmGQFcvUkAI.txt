Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, I, I, I agree with you that I don't, I don't necessarily think we're getting stupider or dumber in this country or in the world in general because of the Internet, but we're definitely getting weirder in our perceptions of actual world events. And I think, um, every time something like mass shootings for instance, like New Zealand, every time one of these horrific tragedies takes place, you see more and more division as I watch people fight over it on Twitter, people blaming leftwing people, people blaming right wing people, people trying to find some reason. And this one is particularly disturbing because it appears that at least one of the guys, I don't know their names, I don't know if they even released, they withheld the names of these guys who've done this. I haven't seen the names. I fought in it. One of them seems like he's trolling.

Speaker 1:          00:55          Like he, he thanked Pewdie Pie and, and said that Candace Owens was as big as inspiration and he's doing that. Well, I guess we could agree. Some people are saying that that okay, sign is a white power sign. I know we had this dispute with Tim Pool where he was saying, I guess it is a game that some people do play. What is it called, the game? The look, I don't know if there's an official name. There's some game where if you look under the table, you see someone doing that. There are a lot of punch you or something. Something stupid like that. I saw the Steven Miller photo where he's doing up his blazer and supposedly doing the why, but that of that, is that the evidence enough? No, and there was a woman in court too that was doing that where she had her hand like this and people were saying that.

Speaker 1:          01:34          But that's what people are talking about rather than, right. Which is ridiculous. Like Ah, evidence, evidence. But this guy in custody is clearly making that symbol clearly. So like, what is he, you know, he's like some troll murderer, some troll mass murderer, and he's both, he's both fucking with everybody. And a cold blooded ruthless killer of people that were praying. Yeah. I mean, I think let's not lose sight of that. You have to have some serious hatred to walk into a mosque and gun down. Yeah. He's a TTA people in seven people in the other one. You know that's, yeah, it's horrific across the board, top to bottom. It's, it's horrific, but it's also one of those things where like we see so many of these now that we're, we're starting to get numb. Whether it's a a Jewish synagogue, whether it's a, you know, a Muslim temple, whether it's a gay club where whether whatever it is, it's like you see so many of these mass murders now that it's just whether it's a school or a movie theater.

Speaker 1:          02:34          I'd like, fuck man. It's just it all, like you were talking about when you were filming the news and you're, you're there, you're watching the bullets fly by. You hear them fly by your head and you are just watching it through the Lens. We are many, many, many, many levels removed from that and we're sitting here trying to figure out what to do and we're there. We're not where the bullets and the people that are there where the bullets take place. They try to give you a description of it and even they barely can comprehend what happened.

Speaker 2:          03:09          But, but also as you said, we're going straight to the argument about who to blame. When did he follow and you know, rather than, yes. I mean if people spent as much time as they spend arguing on Twitter at reading [inaudible] I know people say fake news, you know that there are people who you can trust if they write a 10,000 word piece on Syria for the New Yorker for example, like you know that they're, they're being fact check and maybe it would be

Speaker 1:          03:32          better if there was a website where we curated all of like the bulletproof, that's terrible way to describe it, but you know, Lock Sa Rock solid investigative journalism's that are 100% ethical that you could completely rely on for an accurate assessment of what's happening. Because it is difficult for people and when people, they, they rely on biased websites, which many of them do, whether it's biased to the left or bias to the right, things get even more money. And there's so many of them. It's so easy to get, so easy to reinforce your confirmation bias, Wa whatever, you know, whether it's left brain or right wing, just find that website, read the comments. These are my people. They think like me.

Speaker 2:          04:16          And, and especially now mean it used to be if you were conservatively and then you'd read the Wall Street Journal or Liberal leading New York Times now, no matter how far off the scale you are, you can find a pretty professional looking website. Yeah. That we'll write a story backing up your prejudice and people aren't looking at the story thinking, okay, I'm gonna find out what happened here. Yeah. They're thinking, I know what my gut feeling tells me I need to find a hit. Not even a story. A headline. Yeah. That justifies my gut feeling about this. And that's as far as it seems to go.

Speaker 1:          04:43          Now, you as a journalist, as a person who risked their life to bring this information to people, how does this make you feel? I mean, is this part of the reason why you needed to do that? MDME therapy, not just the fact that you were, you know, you're, you really are without better useful, without a better term shell shocked. Right? I mean, you're, you're that, that Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. You're there. There's something that comes out of that that's gotta be very, very difficult to recover from and overcome. Yeah. But there's also the fact that you're going over there and bringing this shit back and it doesn't seem to, people don't see to

Speaker 2:          05:17          you give a fuck. And that used to be what kept you going is, is you thought like, some of my work is going to make some kind of difference. And when that starts to fade and you start to think that's not going to happen. That's,

Speaker 1:          05:27          I'm sure your work makes a lot of difference to the people that pay attention to it. That I think we're, we're overwhelmed by bullshit. I think it's everywhere. There's what I mean bullshit. I mean like nonsense. You know, Kim Kardashians psoriasis is in the front page of CNN or something like that. You know what I mean? It's not nonsense to her, but you know what I mean? Like there's, there's stuff that people are concentrating on. It's like Jesus Christ,

Speaker 2:          05:55          I mean, yeah, one of our, one of our docs, Hbo, um, if it got 4 million views, I think that would be considered very good viewing figures in the country of 360 million people. Yeah. Well it's very difficult to do

Speaker 1:          06:07          get people to watch documentaries on real world events. You get them to watch documentaries on like a sex call from Oregon or something like that. Like wow. While country that probably got 10 million. Yeah. It's this, I don't know man. You know, this New Zealand thing really had me rattled. I, and you know what is also strange, people like seem to demand a response. They demand, um, people in the public eye to talk about it and you know, say thoughts and prayers or something like that. But as soon as you say thoughts and prayers, they'll say they'll, it's impressive. We've had that for years and nothing's actually happened. It's, yeah. Yeah. It's um, it's very strict, but like the, I don't know if they, they're concerned that you're not horrified. They want to make sure you are like, who the fuck isn't, like, how could you not be, I don't understand this or is it just they're just frustrated, confused themselves. So just lashing out at any target they can find or anyone they can find.

Speaker 2:          07:08          And also, you know, I mean, I know the footage is available of, of, you know, this guy's head cam as he, as he shot everybody, but, but footage like that has been widely available for a long time now. Um, and I think that's, that's had a massive, nothing effect. I mean, you know, the, the picture of the Syrian refugee washing up on the beach, you know, it felt like that was going to have an effect. It felt like that was the picture that was really gonna gonna change things. No, I'm not sure it then it might have for a couple days. Yeah. And then more news, you know, I mean, not, you know, just to be not completely pessimistic that when you're doing stuff for vice and Hbo, you do get young people reaching out to you and saying, oh, I had no idea. I want to be a photographer or a doctor or maybe that's an effect that's going to be felt down the room. I don't know. It feels like there are, there is a generation of people growing up thinking, I'm not going to play by the normal set of rules like I am going to actually try and do something about this.

Speaker 1:          08:01          I think I really do believe you do have an effect. I think vice certainly has an effect. I think a lot of this has an effect. I think it's very difficult to feel that effect if you're not experiencing it personally. I mean to, to just look out onto the landscape and say, how much of an effect is this having on people? It's hard. Like where are you getting the feedback from? How are you, how are you gauging whether or not this is changing people's perceptions?

Speaker 2:          08:25          Well, sometimes the feedback you do get is is on Twitter we'll get, a few lunatics will say, Oh, you failed to do so. Then you think, wow, we're really having no impact, but I think that's an argument for just not reading the comments.

Speaker 1:          08:37          There's a little bit of that. And then, you know, I had Renee to rest on recently and she's done a lot of work covering all these various, uh, Russian troll farms and how they, uh, so how they essentially organize conflict online and, you know, the, they set up these things where you have like a pro Texas movement and they set them up across the street from a pro Muslim movement and they do it on purpose. And then they have these pro LGBT movement things online. They organize to attack certain people in certain groups, diminish certain aspects and defied parts of the Democratic Party. It's crazy. Yeah. When you hear about shit like that on top of all this, you're like, well, okay, uh, just the, the actual news itself is so difficult to disseminate. It's so difficult to figure out what should I pay attention to? What's real? And then you have this kind of shit happening on top of that. You're like, Whoa, whoa, Whoa, fuck. You know.
