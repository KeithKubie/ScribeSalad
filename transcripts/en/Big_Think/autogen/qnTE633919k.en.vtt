of free speech is generally good there

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410
of free speech is generally good there
 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.550
of free speech is generally good there
are exceptions but i think that the

different way I do think newspapers have

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430
different way I do think newspapers have
 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.990
