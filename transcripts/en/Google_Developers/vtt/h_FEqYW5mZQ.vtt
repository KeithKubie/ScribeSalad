ROGERIO PANIZZUTTI: Our
business at Neuroforma

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.680
is to develop and sell
and distribute solutions

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.610
to improve your brand.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.980
Two experiments right
now with these products.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.450
One is with patients
with schizophrenia.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.560
Schizophrenia is a very
debilitating disorder,

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:28.540
where people hear voices.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.850
People get stressed.

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.680
But also they have
problems in memory,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.320
in attention, the capacity
to solve problems.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.140
And the problem to solve
problems, these impairments

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.250
in memory and attention this
makes them very incapable

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.710
to do work or social life or
they have difficulties even

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.610
to see how people are feeling.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.060
So we are providing this
kind of exercise for them

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.670
in the hospital in this
Institute of Psychiatry

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.190
here in Rio.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.069
And they are being
evaluated before and after

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:06.980
the intervention
for how they have

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.620
their memory, their attention,
and so on works, but also

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.130
for their quality of life, how
they are seeing their life,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.020
how they feel about their lives.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.070
And we do this before
and after the training

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.588
to see the impact
of the training.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.380
For me, as a
neuroscientist, it is a way

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.960
to put neuroscience
to work for people.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.640
And using technology allows
us to reach many, many people

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.980
with only a few resources.

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.580
In Brazil, as we
are a huge country,

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.390
I think that using technology
like that, based on web,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.690
we can use these from Rio de
Janeiro up to the Amazon Forest

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.170
or the south of Brazil.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.600
So I think that the
potential for that,

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.800
when you think about health,
improving health promotion,

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.840
it's huge.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.120
And you don't have so
many things nowadays

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.830
to improve mental health,
to promote mental health.
