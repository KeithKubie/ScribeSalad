[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.100
Earth.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.260
Billions of years ago, it was
just a hot jumble of elements,

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.840
which over time have solidified
into the very rocks

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.090
that we stand on.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.298
Right?

00:00:30.298 --> 00:00:31.548
OK.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.550
These rocks have come from
a quarry in Portland, and

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.060
they're made of limestone,
which is a

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.130
type of calcium carbonate.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.210
Masons would use these blocks
pretty much as they are in the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.270
construction industry.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.660
These rocks have been formed
over millions of years from

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.300
shells like this.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.710
So these have just collected at
the bottom of the ocean and

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.770
been compressed, and we can
actually even see some of the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.370
shells in this rock here.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.530
Because the shell and the rock
are made of the same chemical

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.040
substance, calcium carbonate,
they have the same chemical

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.290
properties.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.940
So here we have some
hydrochloric acid.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.310
And the bubbles that you see
instantly formed in here, this

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.070
is carbon dioxide gas.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.950
There's another way we can drive
out the carbon dioxide,

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.402
and that's simply
by heating it.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.180
So this block now has been
in the oven for 24 hours.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.400
It was allowed to
cool overnight.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.270
And well it looks pretty much
just the same as it did

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.310
before, but actually, it's
completely different.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.370
its chemical structure
has now changed.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:02.790
Before, we hand calcium
carbonate, and heating it up

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.360
drives out the carbon dioxide
and leaves us with calcium

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.320
oxide, or quicklime.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.790
Because we've driven out all
of the carbon dioxide from

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.660
this rock, it's actually lost
quite a lot of its weight.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.600
But it's also changed in
structure, and we're now going

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.730
to see why it is that you won't
find any buildings made

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.105
out of calcium oxide.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.890
The change that takes place when
limestone is converted

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.610
into quicklime, or calcium
oxide, has been known for many

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.040
hundreds of years.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.150
Here, in this book from 1526,
we see the process.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.110
We see a chap with a furnace in
the background and boulders

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.710
of limestone and he's pouring
water on this.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.640
Quicklime literally means,
living lime.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.260
And we can see this as the water
instantly vaporises.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.770
It's turning into steam in this
very violent reaction.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.980
It's combining with the
quicklime, we can see it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.220
crumbling away, blistering.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.320
Bits of it are flying off,
popping in all directions,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.870
generating a lot of heat,
which we can see

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.900
as the steam here.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.500
During this process, called
slaking, the calcium oxide

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.580
reacts with the water to form
calcium hydroxide, and this is

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.190
a key component of cement.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.580
This has been used since
Roman times and

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.364
it's still used today.

00:03:35.364 --> 00:04:05.140
