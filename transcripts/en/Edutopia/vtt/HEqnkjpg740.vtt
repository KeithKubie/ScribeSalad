&gt;&gt;Chris Barbic: You know
it's funny 'cause if you talk

00:00:08.776 --> 00:00:12.116
at reform circles now, I mean, the
big buzz word is "human capital."

00:00:12.116 --> 00:00:13.976
You know? This is all
about human capital.

00:00:13.976 --> 00:00:16.376
And you know, we've been
doing this for ten years now,

00:00:16.376 --> 00:00:19.416
and I think we knew from day
one that that was the key.

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:22.696
I mean you got to have a great
teacher in every classroom and,

00:00:23.186 --> 00:00:24.726
you know, the rest
of the stuff's great.

00:00:24.726 --> 00:00:27.086
You know? Computers
and stuff, and things--

00:00:27.086 --> 00:00:30.536
that's all dandy, but if you
don't have a great teacher

00:00:30.536 --> 00:00:32.276
in the classroom, it
doesn't really matter.

00:00:32.276 --> 00:00:34.636
At a lot of places, everyone sort

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:36.256
of writes off the first
few years as well.

00:00:36.256 --> 00:00:38.376
You know, that's when you learn
how to be a great teacher.

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:39.786
And you're not really a
good teacher until, like,

00:00:39.786 --> 00:00:40.806
your third or fourth year.

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:44.396
Well, like, that's great for the
teacher, but they got three years

00:00:44.396 --> 00:00:48.146
of kids that are going through their
classroom, and you know, that's two

00:00:48.266 --> 00:00:51.256
or three years of bad instruction.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:53.396
I mean that sets kids back forever.

00:00:54.496 --> 00:00:58.826
It's about discipline, and teaching
our kids how to make good decisions,

00:00:58.826 --> 00:01:03.536
and be disciplined people,
and it's about love, you know?

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:07.396
And I think it's that balance
of, you know, tough and love.

00:01:07.396 --> 00:01:10.376
And I think our best teachers--
they're like alchemists, you know?

00:01:10.376 --> 00:01:12.386
They can put those
two things together,

00:01:12.746 --> 00:01:16.946
and they know when to put their
arm around a kid and, you know,

00:01:17.056 --> 00:01:19.736
give them the pep talk and show
some love, and they know when to,

00:01:20.166 --> 00:01:22.876
you know, I won't say get in
a kid's face, but you know,

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:26.146
they know when to raise their
voice and get a kid's attention.

00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:29.656
And I think, you know, our best
teachers can bring those two things

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.406
together, and I think that's
really the culture of this place is

00:01:32.406 --> 00:01:34.806
that we want to hold
each other accountable.

00:01:34.806 --> 00:01:36.666
We want to push each
other to be great,

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:38.036
but we want to do it in a loving way.

00:01:38.036 --> 00:01:41.406
And so from there, we've
tried to set up systems that,

00:01:41.896 --> 00:01:43.236
you know, allow us to do that.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:47.476
I mean, the basic one's just the
size of the school and making sure

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:51.746
that this isn't, you know, a school
with 3,000 kids where, you know,

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:55.096
students go from classroom to
classroom and maybe, you know,

00:01:55.096 --> 00:01:57.486
once a week someone calls
them by their first name.

00:01:57.486 --> 00:01:58.946
That's not this place.

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.376
I love doing the home visits.

00:02:01.376 --> 00:02:03.916
So the home visits are when, you
know, after a kid's, you know,

00:02:03.916 --> 00:02:07.376
name's been picked in a lottery,
go and visit their house and we go

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:09.276
through the contract with
them and their parents,

00:02:09.276 --> 00:02:12.056
and we talk about this is what
it means to be a student at YES.

00:02:12.136 --> 00:02:15.796
And you know, the reason I love this
is, you know, we have 4,000 kids

00:02:15.796 --> 00:02:18.756
on our waitlist, so when you go
to those, when you go to a house,

00:02:19.086 --> 00:02:21.296
I mean that family really
has won the lottery.

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:24.746
I mean that kid's-- this is going
to be his legitimate pathway,

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:26.736
or her legitimate pathway
to go to college,

00:02:26.736 --> 00:02:29.336
and really change the
dynamics of that entire family.

00:02:30.006 --> 00:02:33.866
So it's fun to be there because,
you know, they're excited.

00:02:33.866 --> 00:02:36.446
And the contract, I
think, it's symbolic.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:40.166
It's -- you know, what we
want parents to understand is

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:42.056
that this has got to be
a team effort, you know?

00:02:42.056 --> 00:02:45.796
If it's just us wanting this
thing and them not really caring,

00:02:45.796 --> 00:02:47.726
and the kid really not wanting to
be here, this isn't going to work.

00:02:47.726 --> 00:02:51.216
And if it's just the kid wanting to
be here and we're not doing our job,

00:02:51.216 --> 00:02:53.366
and the parents aren't supporting
them, it's not going to work.

00:02:53.816 --> 00:02:56.736
So part of it is just saying look,
this is a three-legged stool.

00:02:56.846 --> 00:03:00.256
It's us, it's your kid, and it's
you, and if we work together

00:03:00.256 --> 00:03:02.336
for the next seven years, your
kid's going to be able to go

00:03:02.336 --> 00:03:05.326
to any college they want to.

00:03:05.496 --> 00:03:08.426
The signage and the
messaging and, you know,

00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:09.986
when you walk into a classroom,

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:11.666
I mean there's stuff
up all over the walls.

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:13.386
You know, all that's intentional.

00:03:13.666 --> 00:03:16.866
When I was a teacher,
I mean my goal was even

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.336
if the kids aren't paying
attention to me and they're looking

00:03:19.336 --> 00:03:21.986
around the room or daydreaming, I
want them learning something, right?

00:03:21.986 --> 00:03:26.316
But there really has to be kind
of a marketing campaign every day

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:30.086
around why are you here, what
this is going to lead to,

00:03:30.086 --> 00:03:32.486
and why college is really
important, and the kind of people

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:33.656
that we want our kids to be.

00:03:34.126 --> 00:03:35.286
The part of it is just making sure

00:03:35.286 --> 00:03:37.286
that kids are getting
the right messages

00:03:37.366 --> 00:03:40.116
because when they're not
here, they're bombarded

00:03:40.116 --> 00:03:41.356
with a whole other set of them.

00:03:41.446 --> 00:03:44.616
You know, whether it's on TV,
or from their, you know, peers,

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:46.106
or just being in the neighborhood.

00:03:46.106 --> 00:03:50.156
And so if we're not aware of
that and trying to, you know,

00:03:50.156 --> 00:03:53.836
fight that with positive messaging
here, we're fooling ourselves.

00:03:54.036 --> 00:03:57.836
So student council basically came
up with these things, you know,

00:03:57.836 --> 00:04:01.746
and you know, we tweaked it a
little bit, and so when we looked

00:04:01.746 --> 00:04:04.566
at it we said, "Well look, you
know, some of these are behaviors

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:06.016
and some of these are values."

00:04:06.016 --> 00:04:07.426
So we kind of divided them

00:04:07.426 --> 00:04:09.536
up into what we call the
YES prep, "Thinks and Acts."

00:04:09.536 --> 00:04:13.376
And so this, along with the core
values, have really become kind

00:04:13.376 --> 00:04:17.136
of the, like, the cornerstone
for the culture of the school.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:19.736
And so I feel like, you know,
one of my jobs and the jobs

00:04:19.736 --> 00:04:22.436
of the leaderships across this
organization is to make sure

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:25.296
that we're living those signs,
we're living those values,

00:04:25.296 --> 00:04:28.256
and that we are walking,
breathing examples of the kind

00:04:28.256 --> 00:04:30.256
of people we want our kids to be.

00:04:31.586 --> 00:04:33.246
There was a time when, you know,

00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:36.576
the post office swore they could
not deliver a package overnight.

00:04:36.576 --> 00:04:38.006
Next-day air was impossible.

00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:41.766
And, you know, FedEx got to a
certain size, and UPS came along

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.356
and they started to grow,
and guess what happened?

00:04:44.716 --> 00:04:47.066
You know, FedEx figured out-- or
the post office figured out how

00:04:47.066 --> 00:04:50.216
to do next-day air, and that's what
we're going to do to the district.

00:04:50.216 --> 00:04:52.126
We're not going to replace the
district, but we're going to get

00:04:52.126 --> 00:04:54.516
to a certain size where
we're going to force HISD

00:04:54.516 --> 00:04:57.276
and other districts
in Houston to improve.

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.746
They're going to have to figure out
how to deliver a package over night,

00:04:59.746 --> 00:05:01.746
and what delivering a
package overnight means,

00:05:02.196 --> 00:05:04.316
not making any excuses
why kids who live

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:07.096
in certain neighborhoods can't
all be prepared to go to college.

00:05:08.056 --> 00:05:09.086
It's kind of human nature.

00:05:09.086 --> 00:05:13.316
Like when the first thing you
want to do is kind of, you know--

00:05:13.316 --> 00:05:16.506
I call it picking up the magnifying
glass before you pick up the mirror,

00:05:16.656 --> 00:05:19.856
and you know, instead of picking
up the mirror and saying, "Okay.

00:05:19.856 --> 00:05:21.036
What are we doing wrong?"

00:05:21.316 --> 00:05:23.486
You know, you pick up the magnifying
glass and you're trying to figure

00:05:23.486 --> 00:05:27.186
out all the reasons why this thing's
not really working or it's smoke

00:05:27.186 --> 00:05:29.866
and mirrors, or you know, they
can do things that we can't.

00:05:30.586 --> 00:05:31.806
And, you know, I get that.

00:05:31.806 --> 00:05:32.896
I mean it's human nature.

00:05:32.896 --> 00:05:36.316
And it does create some tension,
and I think what we've tried to do

00:05:36.316 --> 00:05:40.096
by opening up the doors and
saying, "Look, here it is."

00:05:40.096 --> 00:05:42.256
You know, it goes back to the
transparency thing we talked

00:05:42.256 --> 00:05:43.206
about a little while ago.

00:05:43.206 --> 00:05:44.606
I mean this is who we are.

00:05:44.606 --> 00:05:47.456
Like we're not going to apologize
for it, and if there's things

00:05:47.456 --> 00:05:51.746
that we can do that you can't, I
mean my question is well how come?

00:05:51.746 --> 00:05:53.856
I mean we're a public school
too, you're a public school.

00:05:53.856 --> 00:05:57.076
Like why can't you do those things?

00:05:57.326 --> 00:06:00.356
And no one's really ever been able
to give me a really good answer

00:06:00.646 --> 00:06:03.446
for that, and you know,
we want to share.

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:05.376
I mean it's in our best interest

00:06:05.576 --> 00:06:07.466
for all the schools in
Houston to be great.

00:06:07.886 --> 00:06:12.556
And you know, we don't win by
getting to be the darlings, you know,

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:15.466
of the media or whatever because
we've gotten great results.

00:06:15.796 --> 00:06:19.156
We win if more schools are great
because of what we're doing.

00:06:19.156 --> 00:06:23.726
And if we can be the proof point or
the experiment, or the Petri dish,

00:06:23.726 --> 00:06:25.836
or the R and D lab, or whatever
it is you want to call it

00:06:25.836 --> 00:06:29.266
for the larger system, I mean
that's the role we welcome.

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:33.116
And I think now because we've been
doing this for 10 years, in my mind,

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:35.916
it's time to get this out of
the Petri dish and out of the R

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:37.926
and D lab, and it's time
to take this to scale.

00:06:38.056 --> 00:06:40.906
