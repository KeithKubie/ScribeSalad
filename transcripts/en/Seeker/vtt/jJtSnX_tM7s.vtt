00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.370
I HATE the smell of bleach.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.370
I hate it.

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.799
It just makes me nauseated.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.420
We've got white noise and white light -- can
I get some white smell to cover that crap

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.789
up?

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.279
White smell is like white light or white noise;
it forms a masking effect which prevents other

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.449
smells from making an impact on your eardrum
or retina.

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:39.870
Thinking about it that way, scientists in
Israel created a white smell for the olfactory

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:40.870
bulb.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.410
Using 86 different monomolecular odorants,
they created multiple sprays ranging from

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.390
1 to 43-odors in each.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.339
They diluted them so all the smells were at
the same intensity, and an algorithm made

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:55.960
sure there was no odor-overlap in the mixture,
using odors that were far enough apart to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.559
hit across the olfactory bulb.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.799
They then tested the scents with average people's
sniffers.

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:06.440
The results showed the more odors they put
in each spray, the more likely people were

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.780
to think they were all the same scent!

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.310
Apparently, anything over 30-odors starts
to smell the same.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.070
The researchers believe using this information,
they can add more, non-overlapping scents

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.130
and create a white smell!

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.899
White noises and white light aren't just…
well they are more than they seem.

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.610
White light is all the frequencies of light
mixed together at the same intensity, right?

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.979
It's white because it's evenly mixed and everything.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.070
White noise is NOT just static or *scrambly*
noise.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.220
White noise is a specific combination of frequencies
at the same intensity, just like white light.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.570
Mix them together and they make white noise!

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.909
There's also pink noise, Brown noise, violet
noise -- they each emphasize different ranges,

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.560
and mask different things.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.210
White smell is the same, you mix the right
number and types of odors together, and you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.259
SHOULD end up with white smell.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.219
White noise/light/smell works because those
various frequencies overwhelm the brain's

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.090
ability to discern any specific one.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.750
If your brain worked better, white noise would
sound like a mix of different sounds, and

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.180
not one overwhelming *chhhhhh*.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.250
In the end, that overwhelming of the brain
ends up masking OTHER sounds which might interrupt

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.850
sleep, for example.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.830
White smell does the same thing; using these
monomolecular odorants, the olfactory bulb

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.470
becomes overstimulated, resulting in the brain
interpreting it as a single masking odor.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.810
The researchers call the smell Laurex and
it doesn't seem to exist in nature.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.940
Wouldn't it be awesome to have a reset button
for smell?

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.590
I mean, coffee beans are commonly used as
a masking odor, and though coffee DOES contain

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.060
lots of components, molecularly speaking they're
too close together to make white smell.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.521
Certain televised odor removers and sprays
claim to eat up or remove bad smells, but

00:02:53.521 --> 00:02:58.700
they simply interact with odor molecules,
rendering them inert.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.190
Some people even put baking soda in the fridge
to absorb odor, but it doesn't; baking soda

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.980
is terrible at absorbing odors.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.040
The baking soda-in-the-fridge trick should
be replaced with a activated-charcoal-in-the-fridge

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.130
trick; because that one actually works.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.110
In the end, the practical application of white
smell is limited at the moment, they're still

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.350
figuring out how to produce it reliably.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.830
Strong smells mixed with Laurex, like roses,
smelled to the average noses like… nothing…

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:51.830
so there might be a day when I never have
to smell bleach again.
