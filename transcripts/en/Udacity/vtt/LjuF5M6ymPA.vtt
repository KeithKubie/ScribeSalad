00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.202
Now that we've fixed a few problems
in the Udacity student data,

00:00:03.202 --> 00:00:06.560
and started to uncover some
relationships between the variables,

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.650
it's time to move on to drawing
conclusions, or making predictions.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.410
You've probably already started to
draw some tentative conclusions.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.870
For example, that students who pass
the subway project spend more minutes in

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.120
the classroom during their first
week than students who don't.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.910
However, even if there was no real
difference between students who passed

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.805
their project than students who didn't,

00:00:26.805 --> 00:00:30.035
you wouldn't expect the two
means to be exactly equal.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:32.805
How can you tell the difference
you saw is a true difference or

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:34.265
if it's due to noise in the data?

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.675
The differences we saw
looked pretty large so

00:00:37.675 --> 00:00:40.625
it may be hard to imagine this
could be due to noise but

00:00:40.625 --> 00:00:43.145
intuition does not always work
very well in these situations.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.780
To rigorously check how likely it would
be to see these results by random

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.320
chance, you need to use statistics.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.780
To learn more about how to do this,

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.540
check out Udacity statistics course
linked in the instructor notes.

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.910
For now we're not going to go further in
this direction since statistics isn't

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.220
required to take this course, but

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.260
keep in mind that the results
we have are only tentative.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.310
They haven't been validated.
