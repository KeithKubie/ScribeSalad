00:00:00.341 --> 00:00:01.747
- Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens.

00:00:01.747 --> 00:00:03.668
I'm in Manila, Philippines,

00:00:03.668 --> 00:00:04.881
and I am sitting down.

00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:06.984
It's actually a little past lunch,

00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:08.972
so it's mid-afternoon meal,

00:00:08.972 --> 00:00:12.167
and I am about to eat
a Filipino food feast

00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:14.697
at a restaurant called Mang Tootz.

00:00:14.697 --> 00:00:17.280
(lively music)

00:00:19.828 --> 00:00:21.752
At Mang Tootz you'll find a full variety

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.446
of local Filipino dishes.

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:24.843
However, one of their specialties

00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:27.120
that no one goes to Mang
Tootz without ordering,

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.107
and even many people come to
Mang Tootz just to eat them,

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:32.739
are their famous banana ramas.

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:34.871
In order to make their famous banana rama

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:37.986
a slice of banana is wrapped
into a thin lumpia wrapper.

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:41.644
It's then deep fried to a
golden crisp and set aside.

00:00:41.644 --> 00:00:43.802
Next, a sugary syrup mixture,

00:00:43.802 --> 00:00:47.416
that almost has a caramel
taste to it, is simmered.

00:00:47.416 --> 00:00:49.182
At the perfect timing

00:00:49.182 --> 00:00:52.339
all the crunchy banana
rolls are added to the syrup

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.827
and tossed so that all the
syrup coats them evenly.

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.713
Finally, a generous amount
of sesame seeds are sprinkled

00:00:58.713 --> 00:01:01.065
in the mixture and it's tossed

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:03.467
until everything is perfectly golden

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.134
and coated in all of that syrup.

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:12.082
What awaits you is one of the best

00:01:12.082 --> 00:01:16.249
crispy sweet banana treats
that you might ever taste.

00:01:31.434 --> 00:01:32.334
Is this Jackfruit?

00:01:32.334 --> 00:01:33.167
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:35.390
- [Mark] Oh okay, can I have jackfruit?

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.911
(server speaks in foreign language)

00:01:37.911 --> 00:01:39.588
And also sisig.

00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:42.886
(server mumbles)

00:01:42.886 --> 00:01:45.803
Okay, then sisig and chicken kebab.

00:01:48.198 --> 00:01:49.289
Okay.

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:50.790
What time are you open til?

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.683
- After nine, (serves mumbles)
around four, 4:30, again, so.

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.628
- [Mark] Okay, okay.

00:01:57.628 --> 00:02:00.128
So we got on the end of lunch.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.521
And then two rice.

00:02:03.521 --> 00:02:04.488
- Two rice.

00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:05.321
- [Mark] Yes, please.

00:02:05.321 --> 00:02:07.256
This is a very local
Filipino food restaurant

00:02:07.256 --> 00:02:08.698
and it's very famous,

00:02:08.698 --> 00:02:11.286
actually throughout all of Manila

00:02:11.286 --> 00:02:14.942
but it's located right next to
the University of Santo Tomas

00:02:14.942 --> 00:02:17.564
so a lot of students eat here,

00:02:17.564 --> 00:02:20.101
and it's a good place just to hang out.

00:02:20.101 --> 00:02:21.668
What I love immediately about coming

00:02:21.668 --> 00:02:25.628
to this restaurant is
the pastel green color.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:29.003
These tables, I love that paint color.

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.234
The one thing I have to admit to you

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:33.665
is that I'm not here
at the most ideal time.

00:02:33.665 --> 00:02:35.037
Due to just circumstances

00:02:35.037 --> 00:02:37.633
and then also due to Manila traffic

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:40.309
we didn't get here
quite when we wanted to.

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.549
So, a couple of the dishes are
already finished for lunch,

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.130
and we're here right before dinner starts,

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.956
so maybe an hour before dinner starts.

00:02:47.956 --> 00:02:50.743
So, we're here kind of in-between
lunch and dinner stage.

00:02:50.743 --> 00:02:53.766
Luckily they still had a couple
of their signature dishes

00:02:53.766 --> 00:02:54.884
that I wanted to try.

00:02:54.884 --> 00:02:56.195
I got a cup of rice here,

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.272
and it comes with a soup on the side.

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:00.463
I'll put this soup over here on the side,

00:03:00.463 --> 00:03:05.088
and a wonderful cup formation of rice.

00:03:05.088 --> 00:03:07.427
What I really want to start
with is the bicol express.

00:03:07.427 --> 00:03:09.987
I spent about a couple of
months in the Philippines

00:03:09.987 --> 00:03:12.162
many years ago and bicol express

00:03:12.162 --> 00:03:13.945
was one of my go-to dishes,

00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:16.018
something I always relied upon.

00:03:16.018 --> 00:03:18.856
It's a dish of pork, plus coconut milk,

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:22.909
and it's also known for
including lots of chilis,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.400
so it's one of my favorite dishes,

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.630
and I cannot wait to try it here.

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.174
So, the pork is all chopped
up into bite-sized pieces.

00:03:31.174 --> 00:03:32.311
It is a little bit oily,

00:03:32.311 --> 00:03:33.465
and then there's yeah.

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:35.954
You can just see how thick
the coconut cream is.

00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:38.675
It's not like a curry

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:43.188
but it's more of like a
curdled coconut cream sauce,

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:46.771
and then there's some
green chilis in here.

00:03:49.904 --> 00:03:51.815
Bicol express

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:54.123
is one of those dishes that

00:03:54.123 --> 00:03:56.356
oh, it's just wonderful.

00:03:56.356 --> 00:03:59.113
It's a little bit oily

00:03:59.113 --> 00:04:02.145
but what I really like about it

00:04:02.145 --> 00:04:04.722
really focuses the flavor
on the coconut cream.

00:04:04.722 --> 00:04:05.985
It's not very spicy but it does have

00:04:05.985 --> 00:04:09.050
a very fragrant green chili flavor to it.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.136
Next up, I believe this
is a jackfruit curry,

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:15.065
and I think it's coconut milk as well.

00:04:15.065 --> 00:04:16.571
Maybe young jackfruit,

00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:19.533
and then maybe some
onions in here as well,

00:04:19.533 --> 00:04:21.662
and this looks delicious.

00:04:21.662 --> 00:04:24.296
Jackfruit curry is always an option

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.379
I love to choose when it's available.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:31.422
Again, very nice with the coconut milk,

00:04:31.422 --> 00:04:35.646
and it's salty and then
maybe that's onions

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:36.771
that I'm tasting.

00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:40.935
The actual pieces of jackfruit
are very soft and tender,

00:04:40.935 --> 00:04:42.943
and then it has a very nice kind of,

00:04:42.943 --> 00:04:45.411
I think it's maybe an onion-y taste

00:04:45.411 --> 00:04:47.529
along with lots of
garlic in there as well,

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:50.815
and then again, some
really rich, really thick,

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:52.324
buttery coconut milk.

00:04:52.324 --> 00:04:53.990
Next up, we got some sisig,

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.456
and this one of the national
dishes of the Philippines.

00:04:57.456 --> 00:04:59.636
It is a combination of,

00:04:59.636 --> 00:05:01.746
I think it's mostly pork face,

00:05:01.746 --> 00:05:03.342
which is grilled or roasted,

00:05:03.342 --> 00:05:05.677
and then chopped up, minced up,

00:05:05.677 --> 00:05:06.819
and then it's topped with onions

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:08.890
and chilis, and then calamansi.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:11.410
Squeeze it on top for
some citrus-y flavor,

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:14.743
and I'll go for a bite here.

00:05:15.967 --> 00:05:18.050
Get some of those onions.

00:05:21.985 --> 00:05:24.160
That is extraordinarily porky,

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.730
and it has an amazing smokey taste to it,

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:30.283
and also, you cannot eat
sisig without mentioning

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:32.637
the different textures
that you get in your mouth.

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:34.057
You can taste the little pieces of skin

00:05:34.057 --> 00:05:35.867
which are a little bit chewy

00:05:35.867 --> 00:05:40.054
or a little bit kind
of rubbery in texture.

00:05:40.054 --> 00:05:43.055
Then you've got definitely
some gelatinous bits

00:05:43.055 --> 00:05:47.222
in there plus some like
meaty bits in there.

00:05:47.222 --> 00:05:49.959
You've got the full range of textures

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:52.712
in every bite that you
take when you eat sisig.

00:05:52.712 --> 00:05:57.109
That is a very smokily
fragrant plate of sisig here.

00:05:57.109 --> 00:05:59.812
As I was taking that last bite of sisig,

00:05:59.812 --> 00:06:01.768
I saw that they pulled a brand new batch

00:06:01.768 --> 00:06:05.125
of what is probably
their most famous dish,

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.155
and it's actually a
dessert at this restaurant

00:06:07.155 --> 00:06:09.337
at Mang Tootz.

00:06:09.337 --> 00:06:12.540
When you say Mang Tootz
many people know them

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.186
for this dessert.

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:17.403
People order them by the giant batch,

00:06:17.403 --> 00:06:19.897
so they're packing up huge orders,

00:06:19.897 --> 00:06:22.190
and then the owner, he really nicely

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:24.298
she gave us a fresh plate of them

00:06:24.298 --> 00:06:25.533
right out of the oil,

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:26.366
and when you order them

00:06:26.366 --> 00:06:28.629
they put them onto a plate
and then some sprinkles on.

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.796
I think it's some kind of
a fragrant sugar mixture.

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:35.794
These are little wall.

00:06:36.744 --> 00:06:38.133
That is so crispy

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:39.923
that you can barely even
poke your fork through it,

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:43.732
so I think you gotta stab pretty hard.

00:06:43.732 --> 00:06:47.399
Alright, I think I'm
just gonna go right in.

00:06:52.727 --> 00:06:55.059
I'm not even big on sweets.

00:06:55.059 --> 00:06:56.231
I don't even like sweets very much

00:06:56.231 --> 00:06:57.635
but this is really, really good.

00:06:57.635 --> 00:07:00.057
You can like really taste
the flavor of the banana,

00:07:00.057 --> 00:07:03.835
like a multiplied banana taste,

00:07:03.835 --> 00:07:06.094
and then it's really creamy and soft,

00:07:06.094 --> 00:07:10.961
and then that outer wrapper
is just completely crispified.

00:07:10.961 --> 00:07:12.333
It is pretty sweet.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:15.221
It almost tastes like it
has a honey glaze on it,

00:07:15.221 --> 00:07:18.054
plus that extra sprinkle of sugar.

00:07:21.502 --> 00:07:22.772
That is hot, I'm impressed.

00:07:22.772 --> 00:07:26.439
Okay, I got to continue
eating my meats now.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:30.093
Okay, next up I'm gonna
try some of their liempo,

00:07:30.093 --> 00:07:31.012
and actually this is the dish

00:07:31.012 --> 00:07:33.860
that I got the final little portion of it.

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.292
She just scooped it out of the bottom

00:07:35.292 --> 00:07:36.488
of the pan for me.

00:07:36.488 --> 00:07:39.176
She said I could have the last bit,

00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:40.835
and it is grilled pork belly.

00:07:40.835 --> 00:07:43.752
You can see the layers of the meat.

00:07:46.522 --> 00:07:50.536
If you love pork, that's
just salty, smokey,

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:54.043
fatty, meaty wonderful pork.

00:07:54.043 --> 00:07:57.043
I'm gonna taste that with some soup.

00:07:59.132 --> 00:08:01.302
That's pretty salty

00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:02.857
but very light.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:06.700
It just has a little
bit of a cabbage flavor.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.420
The last dish I got.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:09.514
This is the chicken kebab

00:08:09.514 --> 00:08:12.758
which is Mang Tootz is also
known for their chicken kebab.

00:08:12.758 --> 00:08:13.859
Look at that plate.

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:15.238
For the chicken kebab

00:08:15.238 --> 00:08:17.300
they were grilled on skewers,

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.818
and they're pretty good
sized chicken kebabs.

00:08:18.818 --> 00:08:20.552
I think there's chicken,
there's pineapple,

00:08:20.552 --> 00:08:22.036
there's some chilis on there,

00:08:22.036 --> 00:08:23.073
and then when I ordered it,

00:08:23.073 --> 00:08:25.178
she grabbed one of the chicken kebabs.

00:08:25.178 --> 00:08:27.436
She skewered it onto a plate,

00:08:27.436 --> 00:08:31.836
and then ladled on some different sauces.

00:08:31.836 --> 00:08:33.234
One of them looks kind of mayonnaise-y,

00:08:33.234 --> 00:08:37.401
and then almost looks like
a teriyaki soy sauce glaze.

00:08:38.421 --> 00:08:41.264
And so, there's a bunch of things going on

00:08:41.264 --> 00:08:43.287
on this plate of kebab.

00:08:43.287 --> 00:08:45.280
This is not your ordinary kebab.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.363
It's hard to tell if that's
mayonnaise or cheese.

00:08:53.009 --> 00:08:56.075
It's still hard to tell if
that's mayonnaise or cheese.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:58.081
I think it's mayonnaise,

00:08:58.081 --> 00:08:59.735
and almost a little bit of

00:08:59.735 --> 00:09:03.137
a thousand island dressing type of taste.

00:09:03.137 --> 00:09:03.970
It's a little bit dry

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.993
but it does have a good flavor,

00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:07.188
and also, one thing I wanted to mention

00:09:07.188 --> 00:09:10.513
is right behind me there's
a little convenience store,

00:09:10.513 --> 00:09:12.985
so there's the restaurant,

00:09:12.985 --> 00:09:15.012
which serves all the food
to the left-hand side,

00:09:15.012 --> 00:09:16.703
and then right here there's
a little convenience store,

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:18.563
so you can get everything you need.

00:09:18.563 --> 00:09:21.718
Ying and I took a seat right here,

00:09:21.718 --> 00:09:23.388
it's actually on the sidewalk.

00:09:23.388 --> 00:09:26.062
But then outside, it's
such a popular restaurant

00:09:26.062 --> 00:09:27.913
that they have tents sent up,

00:09:27.913 --> 00:09:29.855
which is actually on the road,

00:09:29.855 --> 00:09:31.944
so you can sit outside underneath the tent

00:09:31.944 --> 00:09:33.448
or you can come in here on the sidewalk

00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:37.615
and get more of a sheltered
street food table to sit at.

00:09:38.963 --> 00:09:41.784
Now that I've taste tested
all of the different dishes,

00:09:41.784 --> 00:09:45.617
I'm circling back around
to the bicol express.

00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:49.119
Oh yeah.

00:09:49.119 --> 00:09:53.687
And again, you have so many
different textures of the pork.

00:09:53.687 --> 00:09:57.104
It is soft, kind of tender in some parts,

00:09:57.949 --> 00:10:02.155
then kind of like, almost
like jerky in some parts,

00:10:02.155 --> 00:10:04.749
and then you've got the
tenderness of the fat,

00:10:04.749 --> 00:10:09.014
plus the kind of chewy,
rubberiness of the skin.

00:10:09.014 --> 00:10:10.989
All the textures of the pig

00:10:10.989 --> 00:10:13.746
are in every single pork dish.

00:10:13.746 --> 00:10:16.871
Ying and I just finished
with that pork feast.

00:10:16.871 --> 00:10:19.587
Amazing Filipino food here at Mang Tootz,

00:10:19.587 --> 00:10:21.123
and as I was sitting here,

00:10:21.123 --> 00:10:22.825
what I really like about this place

00:10:22.825 --> 00:10:23.807
is not only the food

00:10:23.807 --> 00:10:25.859
but just the friendly atmosphere.

00:10:25.859 --> 00:10:27.310
A lot of students come here

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.822
just to grab a quick bite on the go.

00:10:29.822 --> 00:10:32.725
They have some of the
classic Filipino dishes.

00:10:32.725 --> 00:10:36.226
Good food, good friendly atmosphere.

00:10:36.226 --> 00:10:39.867
I'm definitely feeling a little heavier

00:10:39.867 --> 00:10:41.373
after that meal.

00:10:41.373 --> 00:10:43.048
I'm gonna end this video right now.

00:10:43.048 --> 00:10:44.815
