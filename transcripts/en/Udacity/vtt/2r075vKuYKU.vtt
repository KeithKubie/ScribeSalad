So, here comes the quiz. What can you do to avoid such as a situation?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Should you drink more coffee, give up smoking, don't take phone calls,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
don't write bugs in the first place, get a better debugger,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
or take the Udacity course on debugging?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
