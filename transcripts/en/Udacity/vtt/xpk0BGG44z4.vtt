My answer is it seems very complex for
a patient to deal with.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.240
There are over 80 categories of
information, and some of their names,

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.330
for example blood oxygen saturation,

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.640
may not be clear to someone
without a medical background.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.610
It seems to validate the idea
that patients should be

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.680
able to just pick a condition they
have to share all related information.
