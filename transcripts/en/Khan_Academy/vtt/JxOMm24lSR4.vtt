00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:04.779
- [Voiceover] So now I have
my two capacitor equations,

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:06.513
the two forms of this equation.

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:10.680
One is I, in terms of V, and
the other is V, in terms of I.

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:13.858
Now, we're gonna basically
look at this equation here,

00:00:13.858 --> 00:00:18.025
and do a little exercise
with it, to see how it works.

00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:24.247
I'm gonna draw a little circuit here.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.273
It's gonna have a current
source, and a capacitor.

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:42.023
The value of the capacitor
is one microfarad.

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.601
The value of our current
source, we'll call it I.

00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:50.407
It's actually gonna look
like a pulse, like that.

00:00:50.407 --> 00:00:53.740
It will go from zero to three milliamps,

00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:59.053
and then back to zero, over here.

00:00:59.053 --> 00:01:01.479
The amount of time it
takes, that's gonna be,

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:05.396
this time here is gonna
be, three milliseconds.

00:01:08.192 --> 00:01:12.109
The question I wanna
answer is, what is V of T?

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.125
Right here.

00:01:16.614 --> 00:01:20.915
We're gonna use this integral
equation to figure that out.

00:01:20.915 --> 00:01:24.466
Over here is where we're
gonna put our answer.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:27.716
This is gonna be T, and this will be I.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.823
Here's I.

00:01:34.352 --> 00:01:38.519
Our plot, right down here,
will be T, and here's V of T.

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.537
We'll plot I this way, on here, in time.

00:01:46.537 --> 00:01:47.494
It's zero.

00:01:47.494 --> 00:01:52.130
Then, it goes up, to some
value, and then it goes over.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.712
So it's a pulse of current.

00:01:54.712 --> 00:01:58.879
We said that that was zero,
this is three milliamps...

00:02:00.195 --> 00:02:02.778
And this is three milliseconds.

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.802
Now, what we want to do,
is we wanna find V of T.

00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:11.930
One of the things we have to do,

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.754
we have to make an
assumption about V, not here.

00:02:14.754 --> 00:02:16.788
We're gonna assume, for our problem here,

00:02:16.788 --> 00:02:20.054
that V naught, equals zero volts.

00:02:20.054 --> 00:02:21.873
What that means is, there's no charge.

00:02:21.873 --> 00:02:24.291
There's zero charge
stored on this capacitor,

00:02:24.291 --> 00:02:27.479
when we start the experiment.

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:29.545
Now then, let's look at
three different time periods.

00:02:29.545 --> 00:02:31.516
Let's look at the period before the pulse,

00:02:31.516 --> 00:02:34.446
during the pulse, and after the pulse.

00:02:34.446 --> 00:02:38.385
We'll break the problem into three parts.

00:02:38.385 --> 00:02:40.919
Part one is before, and we'll do that,

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:42.878
by just looking up here.

00:02:42.878 --> 00:02:47.039
We decided that V naught, was
zero, in the before state.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.740
Put a little zero there.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.157
We decided that I, I is zero,

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:56.618
so that means that the term
inside the integral, is zero.

00:02:56.618 --> 00:03:01.501
What that means, zero plus
zero, is equal to V of T.

00:03:01.501 --> 00:03:05.239
Before the pulse, before the pulse,

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.406
the capacitor equation tells
us, the voltage is zero.

00:03:11.756 --> 00:03:13.645
Okay, now let's go during the pulse.

00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:14.980
Let's do the second of period of time.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.528
Let's do during the pulse.

00:03:17.528 --> 00:03:19.169
Now, we have to be a little more careful.

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.752
We have V equals one
over C, integral from,

00:03:25.273 --> 00:03:29.273
now time equals zero, to
time equals sub-time T.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.705
What's I during the pulse?

00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:35.612
Well, it's sitting right here.

00:03:35.612 --> 00:03:39.612
I is a constant, so we
write in three milliamps.

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:44.492
D tau...

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:51.304
Plus, don't forget the starting voltage.

00:03:51.304 --> 00:03:52.760
What's our starting voltage?

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.080
Well, we look right here, and
the starting voltage is zero.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.913
Plus zero.

00:03:58.772 --> 00:04:00.308
Now, we can solve this.

00:04:00.308 --> 00:04:04.475
V equals one over C, times
three milliamps comes out...

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:14.823
Times the integral, from
zero to T, of D tau.

00:04:17.998 --> 00:04:21.248
That equals, let's plug in C this time,

00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:27.374
three milliamps, divided
by one microfarad,

00:04:32.521 --> 00:04:35.593
times, what does this evaluate to?

00:04:35.593 --> 00:04:39.676
The integral from zero to
T of D tau, is, just T.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:46.076
Let's do a little bit of
arithmetic here, to reduce this.

00:04:46.076 --> 00:04:48.764
Milliamps is 10 to the minus three,

00:04:48.764 --> 00:04:52.097
and microfarads, is 10 to the minus six.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:54.757
Let me move this up.

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.094
We'll keep our plots on there.

00:05:01.094 --> 00:05:04.261
What we end up with is V equals three,

00:05:07.823 --> 00:05:09.488
10 to the minus three,
10 to the minus six,

00:05:09.488 --> 00:05:13.655
so that's three times 10 to
the third, or 3,000 times time.

00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:18.794
What's that?

00:05:18.794 --> 00:05:22.961
That's the equation of a line,
and it has a slope of 3,000,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.128
what's the units here?

00:05:25.128 --> 00:05:27.711
This is 3,000 volts per second.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.772
I'll go over here, and
we'll sketch this in.

00:05:31.772 --> 00:05:33.960
This is gonna be a line,
that's a straight ramp,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.710
with a constant slope, like that.

00:05:37.813 --> 00:05:41.141
It's gonna be happening
all during this pulse.

00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:45.137
We can ask, what's this value right here?

00:05:45.137 --> 00:05:46.596
What's that voltage right there?

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:48.066
Okay, let's work that out.

00:05:48.066 --> 00:05:50.066
T is three milliseconds.

00:05:52.673 --> 00:05:55.098
So let's plug in three
milliseconds, right here.

00:05:55.098 --> 00:05:59.181
V at three milliseconds,
equals 3,000 times three

00:06:04.003 --> 00:06:08.170
milliseconds, and that equals
three times three is nine.

00:06:11.052 --> 00:06:15.052
3,000 times, this is an
exponent of minus three.

00:06:16.929 --> 00:06:19.300
It's gonna be nine volts.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.467
This value, right here,
right there, is nine volts.

00:06:26.292 --> 00:06:29.380
That says the voltage on our capacitor,

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.550
during the pulse, during
the current pulse,

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.494
rises in a straight
line, up to nine volts.

00:06:35.494 --> 00:06:38.124
We got that from this
integral that we did.

00:06:38.124 --> 00:06:40.039
The capacitor's integrating the current,

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:41.339
adding up the current.

00:06:41.339 --> 00:06:46.176
It's integrating this pulse,
to get an ever-rising voltage.

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:49.613
Okay, so now we've solved
the capacitor equation,

00:06:49.613 --> 00:06:51.030
during the pulse.

00:06:52.647 --> 00:06:55.690
Let's go back now, to what
happens after the pulse.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.357
We'll do that over in
the corner, over here.

00:07:02.178 --> 00:07:05.914
Now, let's solve what happens,
after the current pulse.

00:07:05.914 --> 00:07:07.814
What happens to this
voltage, from here on?

00:07:07.814 --> 00:07:08.647
Does it go down?

00:07:08.647 --> 00:07:09.480
Does it go up?

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:10.757
Does it go straight sideways?

00:07:10.757 --> 00:07:12.089
Let's find out, and let's use our

00:07:12.089 --> 00:07:14.589
capacitor equation to do this.

00:07:15.946 --> 00:07:17.937
Now, what we're doing,
is we're gonna define,

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:21.202
we're gonna do a new integral.

00:07:21.202 --> 00:07:25.369
We're gonna start at time
equals three milliseconds.

00:07:27.114 --> 00:07:29.128
What is our voltage at three milliseconds?

00:07:29.128 --> 00:07:30.613
What's V naught?

00:07:30.613 --> 00:07:33.863
V naught, in this case, equals nine volts.

00:07:36.791 --> 00:07:40.532
That's for this period of
time, after three milliseconds.

00:07:40.532 --> 00:07:42.949
We'll use our equation again.

00:07:44.023 --> 00:07:48.023
V is one over C, times
the integral of I of tau,

00:07:52.413 --> 00:07:53.913
D tau, plus V naught.

00:08:00.024 --> 00:08:01.691
It goes from time...

00:08:04.586 --> 00:08:08.669
It goes from time, three
milliseconds, to time T.

00:08:10.665 --> 00:08:15.484
Time T, now, is out here
somewhere on the time scale.

00:08:15.484 --> 00:08:17.928
We know the voltage right
here, we filled it in.

00:08:17.928 --> 00:08:20.993
There's the voltage right
there, we're gonna fill that in.

00:08:20.993 --> 00:08:22.592
We're gonna work out what's the voltage

00:08:22.592 --> 00:08:25.509
out here, after three milliseconds?

00:08:27.398 --> 00:08:29.013
To solve this integral, we look and see,

00:08:29.013 --> 00:08:30.485
"Well, what's I of tau?

00:08:30.485 --> 00:08:32.052
"What's I of tau, during this time?"

00:08:32.052 --> 00:08:33.288
Let's look at our chart.

00:08:33.288 --> 00:08:35.555
The pulse is at zero.

00:08:35.555 --> 00:08:36.427
Oh, look.

00:08:36.427 --> 00:08:38.927
So this whole term right here,

00:08:40.138 --> 00:08:43.138
this entire term right here is zero.

00:08:45.633 --> 00:08:46.664
What is V naught?

00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:48.487
V naught, we decided, was right there.

00:08:48.487 --> 00:08:50.679
V naught is nine volts.

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:52.585
That's where we started from.

00:08:52.585 --> 00:08:55.078
The answer here, after the pulse

00:08:55.078 --> 00:08:57.911
goes away, is V equals nine volts.

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:02.660
I can sketch that in
up here, and basically,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.827
it just goes straight
sideways, at the new voltage.

00:09:08.537 --> 00:09:10.929
That's how we solve a capacitor problem,

00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:12.546
a really simple one.

00:09:12.546 --> 00:09:16.803
It happens that we were
integrating a current pulse,

00:09:16.803 --> 00:09:19.803
and what we got was a voltage ramp.
