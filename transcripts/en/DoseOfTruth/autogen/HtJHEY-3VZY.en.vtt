00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
be reciprocal about it and and so it's
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.540
be reciprocal about it and and so it's
not a massively important part of the

imagination how about that and the idea

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
imagination how about that and the idea
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.080
imagination how about that and the idea
is that as far as I can tell that he's

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090

future people it's something like that
so that that's sort of what testified

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520
so that that's sort of what testified
 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.999
so that that's sort of what testified
means right think about the route well

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009
means right think about the route well
 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.969
means right think about the route well
I'm not kidding I'm not kidding that is

I'm not kidding I'm not kidding that is
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.830
I'm not kidding I'm not kidding that is
what it that's that is the derivation

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840
what it that's that is the derivation
 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.090
what it that's that is the derivation
right it is the derivation so so so

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100
right it is the derivation so so so
 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.670
right it is the derivation so so so
anyways this is a serious issue so that

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680
anyways this is a serious issue so that

Jung was very insistent upon was that
 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.940
Jung was very insistent upon was that
there was a relationship between

unification I really like that idea too

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
unification I really like that idea too
 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690

that you know that that what you're

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700
that you know that that what you're

psychoanalysts in that element of
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.789
psychoanalysts in that element of
thinking is that you are composed of sub

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799
thinking is that you are composed of sub
 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.280

and they're in a war with each other
 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.130

constantly maybe even a Darwinian war

constantly maybe even a Darwinian war
it's been it's been portrayed that way

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599
it's been it's been portrayed that way
 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.860
it's been it's been portrayed that way
by certain neuroscientists and that that

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870
by certain neuroscientists and that that
 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.740

all of that plurality into a

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170
all of that plurality into a
 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.569
all of that plurality into a
hierarchical ethical structure that has

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579
hierarchical ethical structure that has
 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.620
hierarchical ethical structure that has
some canonical ethic at the pinnacle

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630
some canonical ethic at the pinnacle
 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.000
some canonical ethic at the pinnacle
right when we've talked a little bit

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010
right when we've talked a little bit
 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.979
right when we've talked a little bit
about that and it's not obvious what

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989
about that and it's not obvious what
 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.500
about that and it's not obvious what
should be at the pinnacle but we can

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510
should be at the pinnacle but we can
 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.539
should be at the pinnacle but we can
guess at it it's it's that which we

guess at it it's it's that which we
 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.430
guess at it it's it's that which we
admire that's one way of thinking about

admire that's one way of thinking about
 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.430
admire that's one way of thinking about
it it's that that describes fair play

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440
it it's that that describes fair play
 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.680
it it's that that describes fair play

comes back to the community and
distributes what's found and so it's

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790
distributes what's found and so it's
 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.830

challenge voluntarily undertaken it's
 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.320
challenge voluntarily undertaken it's
something like that right and I think

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330
something like that right and I think
 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.210
something like that right and I think
that's echoed in the idea that everyone

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220
that's echoed in the idea that everyone
 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.610
that's echoed in the idea that everyone
has a moral obligation to raise their

cross something like that to accept the

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990
cross something like that to accept the
 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.650
cross something like that to accept the
fact of their mortality voluntarily

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:23.660
fact of their mortality voluntarily
 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:26.320
fact of their mortality voluntarily
I believe that that's the case and I do

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:26.330
I believe that that's the case and I do
 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:27.550
I believe that that's the case and I do
actually think that that's a

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560
actually think that that's a
 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.200
actually think that that's a
prerequisite to proper psychological

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.210
prerequisite to proper psychological
 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.120
prerequisite to proper psychological
development because if you're not

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130
development because if you're not
 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:34.409
development because if you're not
willing to take your mortality on

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419
willing to take your mortality on
 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.580
willing to take your mortality on
voluntarily like if you're kicking and

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590
voluntarily like if you're kicking and
 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:37.870
voluntarily like if you're kicking and
fighting about it constantly

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880
fighting about it constantly
 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.610
fighting about it constantly
and you have every reason to don't get

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620
and you have every reason to don't get
 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.850
and you have every reason to don't get
me wrong then you can't act forthrightly

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860
me wrong then you can't act forthrightly
 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:44.500
me wrong then you can't act forthrightly
in the world right you're going to be

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510
in the world right you're going to be
 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.870
in the world right you're going to be
afraid and when you're afraid then you

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880
afraid and when you're afraid then you
 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.540
afraid and when you're afraid then you
can't voluntarily take on a challenge

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550
can't voluntarily take on a challenge
 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.219
can't voluntarily take on a challenge
and then if you can't take voluntarily

00:05:51.219 --> 00:05:51.229
and then if you can't take voluntarily
 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:52.600
and then if you can't take voluntarily
take on a challenge then you can't

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610
take on a challenge then you can't
 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.180
take on a challenge then you can't
develop and so again the life seems to

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:55.190
develop and so again the life seems to
 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.029
develop and so again the life seems to
be something like if it's a proper life

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039
be something like if it's a proper life
 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:00.730
be something like if it's a proper life
is the voluntarily voluntary taking on

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740
is the voluntarily voluntary taking on
 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.490
is the voluntarily voluntary taking on
of great challenges and maybe that's

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500
of great challenges and maybe that's
 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:05.260
of great challenges and maybe that's
better than happiness like it's

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270
better than happiness like it's
 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.480
better than happiness like it's
certainly more noble you know it's not a

word we use very much anymore the idea

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650
word we use very much anymore the idea
 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.110
word we use very much anymore the idea
of nobility because we're so obsessed

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120
of nobility because we're so obsessed
 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.960
of nobility because we're so obsessed
with happiness but I think happiness is

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:13.970
with happiness but I think happiness is
 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.270
with happiness but I think happiness is

know wonderful don't don't take it

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210
know wonderful don't don't take it
 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.909
know wonderful don't don't take it
lightly or for granted because it's

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919
lightly or for granted because it's
 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.130
lightly or for granted because it's
fleeting but the idea that that's what

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:24.140
fleeting but the idea that that's what
 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:27.550
fleeting but the idea that that's what
you should be for in some sense - seems

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560
you should be for in some sense - seems
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.159
you should be for in some sense - seems
to me if that's what life is for then

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169
to me if that's what life is for then
 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.570
to me if that's what life is for then
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's
 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.230
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's
correct

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240
correct
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.290
correct
because that isn't what life is but it

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300
because that isn't what life is but it
 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.909
because that isn't what life is but it
also doesn't it isn't obvious to me that

00:06:36.909 --> 00:06:36.919
also doesn't it isn't obvious to me that
 

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:39.100
also doesn't it isn't obvious to me that
that's what life should be you know I

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110
that's what life should be you know I
 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.290
that's what life should be you know I
mean if you really loved someone

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300
mean if you really loved someone
 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:44.020
mean if you really loved someone
like like your Sun let's say would you

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030
like like your Sun let's say would you
 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:45.939
like like your Sun let's say would you
say well I hope he has a happy life or

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:45.949
say well I hope he has a happy life or
 

00:06:45.949 --> 00:06:48.550
say well I hope he has a happy life or
would you say I hope he accomplishes

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:48.560
would you say I hope he accomplishes
 

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.249
would you say I hope he accomplishes
great things it seems to me that that's

00:06:51.249 --> 00:06:51.259
great things it seems to me that that's
 

00:06:51.259 --> 00:06:53.950
great things it seems to me that that's
better the accomplishing of great things

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960
better the accomplishing of great things
 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:57.249
better the accomplishing of great things
and because that's admirable you know

00:06:57.249 --> 00:06:57.259
and because that's admirable you know
 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.170
and because that's admirable you know
it's like a happy person is a happy

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180
it's like a happy person is a happy
 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.360
it's like a happy person is a happy
person but a noble person is an

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:01.370
person but a noble person is an
 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.270
person but a noble person is an
admirable person and and that's that's

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280
admirable person and and that's that's
 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.610
admirable person and and that's that's
better man and so maybe there are better

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620
better man and so maybe there are better
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.980
better man and so maybe there are better
things than happiness and so you can't

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:08.990
things than happiness and so you can't
 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.219
things than happiness and so you can't
judge being on the basis of the ratio of

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:12.229
judge being on the basis of the ratio of
 

00:07:12.229 --> 00:07:14.080
judge being on the basis of the ratio of
suffering to pleasure something like

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:14.090
suffering to pleasure something like
 

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.360
suffering to pleasure something like
that it's and I don't think we do that I

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:16.370
that it's and I don't think we do that I
 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.479
that it's and I don't think we do that I
don't believe we do that
