00:00:02.748 --> 00:00:06.080
Harvard invented
college reunions.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.640
The first reunion
took place in 1643,

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.520
a year after the first
commencement, when alumni

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.570
were invited back to celebrate
with the new graduates.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.210
During Harvard's
bicentennial year of 1636,

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.940
the alumni festivities were
particularly exuberant.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.500
Ralph Waldo Emerson of
the Harvard class of 1821

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.635
wrote about the annual Harvard
alumni parade on that day

00:00:32.635 --> 00:00:34.990
in July of 1836.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:38.110
Here is what he
wrote in his journal.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.640
"Cambridge at anytime is full
of ghosts, but on that day

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.340
the anointed eye saw
the crowd of spirits

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.410
that mingled with the
procession in the vacant spaces

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.620
year by year as the
classes proceeded,

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.310
and then the far
longer train of ghosts

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.660
that followed the
company of the men that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.740
wore before us
the college honors

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.780
and the laurels of the
state, the long winding

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.880
train reaching back
into eternity."

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.320
And you can hear in the
background the Harvard band

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.550
playing, and the long
winding train of alumni

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.830
is forming in Harvard yard.

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.020
Rennie, maybe you
can tell us what

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.690
we can expect to
hear this afternoon.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.290
Thank you, Nancy.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.800
Nancy noted that she graduated
from the college in 1976

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.320
and received her MBA from
Harvard Business School in '78.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.242
She has been a member
of the Committee

00:01:32.242 --> 00:01:33.950
for the Happy Observance
of Commencements

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.750
for over 20 years now and
is currently the Alumni

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960
Association's treasurer.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.430
I believe that this is
her eighth year doing

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.320
this broadcasting in
the afternoon exercises.

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.045
So it's a pleasure to join you,
Nancy, high above courtside

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:51.890
here as Johnny Most used to
say before the Celtics games.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.605
In our case, we have three steps
up in what is called the tree

00:01:55.605 --> 00:02:01.430
house on the stage left here
in the Tercentenary Theatre.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.590
And I'd also like to
take the opportunity

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.710
to thank Rachel Lamson,
Director of Board

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.840
Services for the
Alumni Association,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.140
and her assistant Kate
Freed who has put together

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.080
a thick syllabus for us today.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.360
I also want to thank Diane
MacDonald and Deborah

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.265
Smullyan in the Alumni
Association's Class Reports

00:02:21.265 --> 00:02:25.560
Office for providing information
on the fours and nines, which

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.540
are the classes that are
reunioning this week.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.100
Finally, I want to
thank our camera

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.920
crew, Kathy O'Connell,
Bob [? De Maison, ?]

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.910
and Ed McNamara for
the nice job that they

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.510
do with keeping us all
in line and showing off

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.340
this wonderful event.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.680
We're going to see today
the afternoon exercises

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.820
of commencement, robe
after robes scattered

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.060
a rainbow, robes after robes
scattering the rainbow,

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.130
as David McCord said.

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.330
Although we don't see as
many of those in robes

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.720
this afternoon as
we see the alumni,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.590
as this is the annual meeting
of the Alumni Association.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.780
And this is the fourth meeting
of the Alumni Association.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.355
They hold three per year in
the fall, winter, and spring

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:16.270
and then finish up with the
annual Alumni Association,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.998
which we are commencing today.

00:03:19.998 --> 00:03:24.060
The dignitaries are
just coming around.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.940
They've already been
started off with the band.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.860
They are led off by the Chief
Marshal and his aids, Richard

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.580
Barth, who is the Chief
Marshal for commencement.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.220
He is of the 25th
reunion class, but he

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.610
was elected by his
classmates in the fall.

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.950
Both Nancy and I have
chaired that committee

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.720
at one time or another.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.710
And it's the best
and the brightest

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.720
from the class that are chosen.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.470
There are usually eight
or nine candidates

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.645
selected by the class and
voted on by class members.

00:03:56.645 --> 00:04:02.350
The Chief Marshal appoints
alumni to assist the Committee

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.750
for the Happy Observance
of Commencements

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.450
and with such activities
as crowd management,

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.520
the general alumni spread,
the tree spread for college

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.050
graduates who have had
their 50th reunion,

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.380
and the Chief Marshal spread for
distinguished guests, honorans,

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.160
family, and faculty.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.140
Richard Barth, class of '89,
is the CEO of KIPP Foundation,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.270
as Nancy mentioned,
Knowledge and Power

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.910
Program, a network of schools.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.950
KIPP has grown to 141
schools, serving over

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.780
50,000 students
across the country

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.470
in communities
where roughly half

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.050
of the students drop out of
high school and only one in 10

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.490
will earn a college degree.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.030
Among KIPP students, 95% of whom
are African American or Latino

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.470
and 86% of whom are
low-income families, 93%

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:03.330
graduate from high school
and 83% go on to college.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.600
We will hear the welcome from
the president's of the Chief

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.200
Marshal of the
Harvard Association.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.990
They're just coming
down the aisle.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.925
You see can see that--

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:16.650
They're the class of 1928
to the class of 1958.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.400
Our oldest alumni today
are in that group.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.920
You'll see the men
in their top hats.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.550
Those are men who belong
to the Happy Observance

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.620
of Commencement Committee,
Alumni Association committee

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:34.640
that was founded in the
1860s to make sure everybody

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.350
would be happy on
commencement day.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.300
Although, Rennie, I
understand they also

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.510
began to serve alcohol
on commencement,

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.190
and that made the
people even happier.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:46.350
You see the men have
their black top hats.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.510
The women-- you saw earlier
my hat with the feathers.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.500
That's the woman's
version of the top hat,

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.920
and we see many women
in Harvard Yard today

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.420
who have the top hats.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:00.670
So here we have the procession
of our oldest alumni.

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:05.530
And today we're happy to welcome
the two oldest alumni, Lillian

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.690
Sugarman from the
Radcliffe class of 1937

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:15.686
and Robert Rothschild from
the Harvard class of 1939.

00:06:15.686 --> 00:06:21.280
Our President of the Harvard
Alumni Association this year

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:26.470
is Catherine A. Gellert,
AB '93, known as Kate.

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.860
Kate joined the HAA as an
elected director in 2007.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.350
She is a former co-chair
of the Executive Committee

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.100
of the Harvard College
Fund and Vice President

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.000
of Harvard's Engagement
and Marketing Committee.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.690
A Class Reunion
Gift Chair, she also

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.660
served as treasurer of the
Harvard Club of New York City

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.570
before becoming
the HAA president.

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.520
Kate has an MBA from Columbia.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.580
She works in her family's
Manhattan private investment

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.410
business, the
Windcrest Partners.

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.370
Her parents, Michael E. Gellert,
class of '53, and Mary C.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.980
Gellert, a 1957 graduate of
the Harvard Radcliffe Program

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.340
in Business Administration.

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:10.770
And we see now the
25th Reunion Class.

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.990
The great class of 1989
is filing onto the stage.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:17.380
They're passing
right in front of us.

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:22.120
And there are
hundreds of members

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.900
of the class we will have return
today for their 25th reunion.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.350
The 25th reunion
is considered to be

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.960
the major reunion
of a Harvard class.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.380
And it's the 25th, the
30th, and the 50th classes

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.554
who are celebrating
with us today.

00:07:39.554 --> 00:07:43.700
The 30th, 35th, and
40th may be here,

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:47.190
but the chances are that they
are not because they will hold

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.950
their reunions in
the fall, next fall.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:54.240
And this helps with the
Alumni Association staff

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.230
because it doesn't
give them as much work

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.790
to do when they would
have all of the classes.

00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:07.850
So we're seating the classes
proceeding now down the aisle.

00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:13.690
When Kate comes up, she will
welcome us all here today.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:17.325
And then we will sing
"Gaudeamus Igitur,"

00:08:17.325 --> 00:08:22.000
or "So Let Us Rejoice," which is
a popular former academic hymn

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.850
sung in Latin.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.490
Despite its use as such, it
is a jocular, light-hearted

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.560
composition that pokes
fun at university life.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.850
The song dates to the
early 18th century

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:37.990
based on the Latin
manuscript from 1287.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.560
It was known as a
beer-drinking song

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.929
in many ancient
universities, and it

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:44.390
tells you to live the
fullest even though you

00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:46.550
know you can die sometime.

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:49.120
This is including
singing this song.

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.030
We will sing it cheerfully.

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:55.750
It's a beautiful day here in
Cambridge, a perfect afternoon.

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.750
It's sunny and cool with
the temperature in the 60s.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.360
Those of us on the
Happy Committee

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.170
firmly believe that our
late beloved university

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.340
minister Peter Gomes is
managing things from on high

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:11.230
to make sure we had
a beautiful day.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.790
Yesterday it was cold and rainy.

00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:15.390
Tomorrow it is predicted
to be cold and rainy.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:19.190
But our Reverend Peter Gomes
is watching out for us today,

00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:22.200
and we have a perfect
day here in Cambridge.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.250
Professor Gomes, who was the
Plummer Professor of Christian

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.880
Morals for more
than 40 years, has

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.730
said of Harvard commencement
that, "Someone observing

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:35.080
the rather casual
dignity of the day

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.610
remarked that
commencement is more

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.930
like a lawn party than a ballet.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.920
And a less charitable
but more astute observer

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.880
suggested that the vast
assemblage in formation

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.870
in the old yard was very much
like that wonderfully chaotic

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:52.640
game of croquet with
flamingos and hedgehogs

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.740
in Alice in Wonderland.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:58.120
First-time visitors are
horrified at what appears to be

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:01.840
rank confusion"-- as you see
today what appears to be rank

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.740
confusion-- "but then remember
that this is after all Harvard,

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:09.470
where conformity even of
self-preservation has been

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.740
elevated to the rank
of an original sin.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.020
That it works at all is
a tribute to patience

00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:19.820
and goodwill, and the general
sense that, come what may,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:22.870
this day is to be enjoyed."

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:25.330
Rennie, I'm not sure we're
going to see anybody playing

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:28.160
croquet with flamingos
today, but it is certainly

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.710
a beautiful sight to be sitting
here watching the alumni

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:35.930
precess into the
Tercentenary Theatre.

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:39.230
Well, it is a lovely
day, as Nancy said.

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.224
And we can just begin to
see groups coming in now.

00:10:44.224 --> 00:10:46.650
Over the years that
I've been doing this--

00:10:46.650 --> 00:10:52.130
and I think is my 30th year
in the Happy Committee--

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.330
I've watched the
tree spread grow,

00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:59.470
which is all of those graduates
over the 50th reunion class.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:02.980
And now that the tree
spread has grown,

00:11:02.980 --> 00:11:05.560
it takes much longer
for them to come in.

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:09.623
So notice in the picture
that you're seeing there

00:11:09.623 --> 00:11:13.670
that the oldest grads
are just beginning

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:16.190
to make their way
into the stadium.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.710
At the same time,
we have a number

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.850
of groups of younger classes,
different divisions, that

00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:23.190
are coming in from
the side, on what

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:25.890
would be stage right for you.

00:11:25.890 --> 00:11:28.780
Or if you're looking
over by University Hall,

00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:32.400
they would be coming
in from there.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.460
Rennie, can we
continue with the order

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:37.000
of the program for
this afternoon?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.080
Absolutely.

00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.290
Kate will start with
remarks and recognition.

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:45.570
And my guess is she
will first recognize

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.890
Richard Barth, as Nancy has
mentioned, class of '89 who's

00:11:49.890 --> 00:11:52.710
the Chief Marshal
for commencement.

00:11:52.710 --> 00:11:55.380
Traditionally,
the Chief Marshal,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.530
which we mentioned was
picked by his classmates,

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:02.510
or her classmates
and their classmates,

00:12:02.510 --> 00:12:05.070
doesn't say anything
at this ceremony,

00:12:05.070 --> 00:12:08.155
because at the end of
three days of reunioning

00:12:08.155 --> 00:12:12.380
of their 25th reunion,
chances are he

00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:14.020
or she may not
have a voice left.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:18.760
At least that was the case
my year as the Chief Marshal.

00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:23.420
I can remember asking our class
football captain Tim Anderson

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:28.140
to sit next to me and jab
me when I closed my eyes.

00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:33.980
Needless to say, I had a very
sore arm for days afterwards.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.152
I think Kate will also introduce
Robert Rothschild, which

00:12:38.152 --> 00:12:41.950
we mentioned is the oldest
grad, not the oldest living grad

00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:45.740
but the oldest grad that's here
today, and Lillian Sugarman,

00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:50.860
class of '37, who I gather
is older than he is,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.256
representing the oldest
Radcliffe graduate that's here

00:12:54.256 --> 00:12:56.248
today.

00:12:56.248 --> 00:13:02.790
At that time, we will hear from
Kate Gellert, the Announcement

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:07.680
of Overseers, HA, directors,
and election results.

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.770
And we'll wait for Kate
to make that announcement.

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:13.860
The final tally
has just come in.

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:20.450
It's an area that we wish more
graduates would take the time

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:21.750
to elect.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.600
It's always a small
percentage that

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.142
really do elect the
overseers and the directors

00:13:27.142 --> 00:13:29.920
of the Harvard Alumni
Association, which

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.320
is rather sad because it is
an opportunity for getting

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.945
the best and brightest to
help serve on the overseers

00:13:36.945 --> 00:13:41.960
and for the Harvard Alumni
Association as directors.

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.825
After that has happened,
we'll have the presentation

00:13:48.825 --> 00:13:51.400
of the Harvard Medals.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.000
The Harvard Medal is
awarded by the HAA

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.870
for extraordinary service
to Harvard University.

00:13:57.870 --> 00:14:02.190
The word service includes
teaching, administration,

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.480
fundraising, and other
alumni activities.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.700
Three to five
Harvard Medals have

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.630
been awarded at
each commencement

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:15.370
since 1981, except for the
350th celebration in 1986

00:14:15.370 --> 00:14:18.265
when 20 medals were presented.

00:14:18.265 --> 00:14:21.770
It's an interesting
mix of graduates

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:25.050
who have received this medal.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.710
To name but a few, Al
Gordon, class and '23,

00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:31.310
who Gordon Track
Center is named after

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:35.220
and a very loyal alum
to Harvard in many ways.

00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.270
Former Radcliffe
President Matina Horner.

00:14:38.270 --> 00:14:39.840
Poet and fundraiser
David McCord,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:48.000
whom I quoted earlier as robe
after robe scattered a rainbow.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.230
David was a much-beloved
fundraiser for Harvard,

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:51.900
and [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:57.830
In fact, I started my career
as a father-son combination,

00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.985
my father class of 1919, and
I a father-son combination

00:15:01.985 --> 00:15:04.700
fundraising for David.

00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.595
More familiar names might be
hockey coach Bill Cleary, who

00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:12.960
we've seen here today, my
old track coach Bill McCurdy,

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.830
crew coach Harry Parker,
who received it last year,

00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.750
I believe, Nancy, if
I remember correctly.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:18.250
Yes.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.990
Librarian Agnes Mongan.

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:26.620
And also showing you what
extraordinary service means,

00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:30.490
Eddie Chamberlain, who for
years was Kirkland House's best

00:15:30.490 --> 00:15:32.330
beloved superintendent.

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:35.090
And here, Rennie, we have a
picture of the 50th reunion

00:15:35.090 --> 00:15:40.390
class, the great class of 1964,
as they line up to precess

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.620
into Tercentenary Theatre.

00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:47.390
Tercentenary Theatre is
called Tercentenary Theatre,

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:51.590
and it was dedicated at the
300th anniversary celebration

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.420
of Harvard's founding in 1936.

00:15:54.420 --> 00:15:58.590
It's bordered by Widener
Library, University Hall,

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:01.760
Memorial Church, and
the great Sever Hall,

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.170
which was designed by the
renowned American architect

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.160
and Harvard graduate
H.H. Richardson.

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.840
The tent which the
dignitaries are under

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:17.620
was replaced from an old one
that leaked badly in 1985.

00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:21.010
So the present tent
when it is replaced

00:16:21.010 --> 00:16:23.590
will become part
of the past tense.

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:32.580
Maybe I ought to get a
symbol crash on that, Nancy.

00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:38.130
We'll progress down
after the presentation

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:43.654
of the medals, which if not,
we can mention those, perhaps.

00:16:43.654 --> 00:16:44.820
You've got them right there.

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.850
I've got them here, I think.

00:16:46.850 --> 00:16:49.820
Unfortunately,
there are usually,

00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:53.250
as I said, any number of
them, but they're usually

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.340
have been three in the past.

00:16:55.340 --> 00:17:03.640
And this year there will be only
two presented at this ceremony.

00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.319
It will be Louis Newell
from the class of 1957.

00:17:07.319 --> 00:17:10.740
Unfortunately, he is
unable to be with us today.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:13.430
But Emily Pulitzer.

00:17:13.430 --> 00:17:14.480
Right.

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.619
And Anand Mahindra.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:22.579
Anand is from the class
of 1977, MBA 1981.

00:17:22.579 --> 00:17:31.630
And Emily Pulitzer received a
Master of Arts degree in 1963.

00:17:31.630 --> 00:17:34.920
I should mention we will
watch the 50th reunion go by,

00:17:34.920 --> 00:17:37.060
that that's Scott
Harshbarger's class.

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:40.980
There it is, the
great class of 1964.

00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:43.860
Interesting, the reunion
classes as they come in,

00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.340
Nancy mentioned the 80th
as being the oldest,

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.002
but perhaps the class
of 1970 and 1944

00:17:51.002 --> 00:17:53.660
is having their 70th reunion.

00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:55.320
And that's an
interesting classes

00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:57.580
in that their
class secretary who

00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:03.010
was appointed at the time
they graduate, Dan Fenn,

00:18:03.010 --> 00:18:07.120
has been at it ever since 1944.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:12.200
He's the oldest class secretary
and the oldest in longevity.

00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.840
And it's interesting to
note that the class of 1944,

00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.920
as far as we know, the only
class to have had five Nobel

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.890
Prize winners in it-- two
presidential advisers, of which

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.480
Dan Fenn was actually--
Dan Fenn headed up

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:29.900
the Kennedy Library
at one point.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:35.230
And two former
musical composers.

00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:41.270
So it's a well-known class, and
there are quite a few of them

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.280
here today.

00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:46.150
Continuing with the afternoon
program, Kate Gellert

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:51.270
will inform us of class gifts
to the Harvard College Fund.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.450
One gift that is the
most important gift

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:59.090
was one by Ken Griffin,
who gave $175 million

00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:02.885
to Harvard College, which is the
biggest single gift ever made

00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.170
to Harvard College.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:09.400
The money will largely go to
the college's financial aid

00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:10.660
program.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.050
The annual cost of
attending Harvard College

00:19:13.050 --> 00:19:17.910
is currently $60,000,
and more than 70%

00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:19.810
of Harvard
undergraduates receive

00:19:19.810 --> 00:19:24.560
some form of financial aid.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.520
Good deal of that, probably
$40 million of that,

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:31.600
which Nancy mentioned, will go
towards creating 200 Griffin

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.260
scholars, and $125 million
providing three-to-one matching

00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:41.110
funds for a new program that's
to create 600 scholarship.

00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:44.140
In return, Harvard will rename
its college financial aid

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.090
office and its director's
title after Griffin.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:51.026
Griffin, who is estimated
worth 4.4 billion,

00:19:51.026 --> 00:19:55.946
founded Citadel one year
after graduating from Harvard.

00:19:55.946 --> 00:19:59.650
Harvard embarked last
September on a $6.5

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:05.800
billion-dollar campaign, and
this gift from Ken Griffin

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.380
will be part of that Harvard
campaign, which I understand,

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.845
Rennie, is going very well.

00:20:10.845 --> 00:20:13.580
And so Harvard's trying
to raise $6.5 million

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:18.382
over the course of
the next five years.

00:20:18.382 --> 00:20:20.740
It's going along well,
as I understand it.

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.670
We call ourselves in the Alumni
Association the friendraisers.

00:20:29.670 --> 00:20:33.980
And we call our colleagues in
the money-raising end of it

00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:35.320
the fundraisers.

00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:39.610
So both of them
work well together.

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:44.730
After the introduction and we
hear about the financial end

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:48.650
of things, the
band will come down

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:51.030
the aisles playing
"Harvardiana."

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.020
They'll swing down
the center aisle

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.600
with a collection of
Harvard fight songs,

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.816
including Tom Lehrer's
"Fight Fiercely Harvard."

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:01.190
Some of you may
be aware of this.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.740
He put this together
back in the '50s.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.160
"Fight fiercely, Harvard.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:06.870
Fight, fight, fight.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:09.610
Demonstrate to them our will.

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:14.242
Albeit they possess the might,
nevertheless we have the will.

00:21:14.242 --> 00:21:16.640
We will celebrate our victory.

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.080
We'll have the whole
team up for tea.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.496
How jolly.

00:21:20.496 --> 00:21:22.856
Throw that spheroid
down the field,

00:21:22.856 --> 00:21:26.380
and fight, fight, fight."

00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.600
Following Harvardiana, we will
have the report to the alumni

00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.860
by our president,
Drew Gilpin Faust.

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.690
She is the 28th president
of the university,

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.390
and she will give us her annual
report, which will give us

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.680
a picture of current
happenings along with a view

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:46.170
toward the future.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:48.810
She will be with
us tomorrow, too,

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:52.940
when we celebrate Radcliffe
Day and receive the Radcliffe

00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.440
Medal.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.090
It's been 15 years
now that the Radcliffe

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:58.390
Institute took over the Harvard.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.330
You may know that Radcliffe
was founded as the Harvard

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:08.680
Annex in 1879 and chartered
as Radcliffe in 1894.

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.010
It merged with Harvard in 1999.

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:17.950
From 1963 to 1976, just
before Nancy graduated,

00:22:17.950 --> 00:22:22.100
the Harvard diplomas were signed
by both Radcliffe and Harvard.

00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:25.500
My diploma is more valuable
than yours, Rennie,

00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:28.700
because I have two presidents
who signed my diploma

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.120
and you only have one.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.980
That's true.

00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:31.920
That's true.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.233
Well, I get a lot of
kidding from my wife who

00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:36.890
was a Radcliffe graduate.

00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:38.870
I always said she was
the magna cum laude

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:41.420
and I was the laude
[? a ?] cumma.

00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:43.680
In any case we will--

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:45.770
After the report
to the alumni, we

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:48.900
will sing the
Radcliffe alma mater,

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:52.070
"Radcliffe, Now We
Rise to Greet Thee."

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.130
And following that, we will
have the principal commencement

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:55.650
address.

00:22:55.650 --> 00:22:58.420
It will be given by
Michael Bloomberg,

00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:02.100
the former mayor
of New York City.

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.940
Prior to that, he founded
Bloomberg Communications,

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:10.460
which is a global
communications firm.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:15.870
Since leaving the mayor
office in New York City,

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:20.650
he runs Bloomberg Philanthropies
and he's the UN special envoy

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.440
for cities and climate change.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.450
He's also done work
to try to increase

00:23:27.450 --> 00:23:29.980
gun control in
the United States.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:35.240
So we're all looking forward
to Michael Bloomberg's address.

00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:37.275
He graduated from Johns
Hopkins University

00:23:37.275 --> 00:23:40.890
for his undergraduate degree,
and then he received an MBA

00:23:40.890 --> 00:23:44.300
from Harvard Business
School in 1966.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.330
And today he received
an honorary degree

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:49.520
of Doctor of Laws.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.580
Yes, he's a local boy.

00:23:51.580 --> 00:23:56.225
He was born in 1942, and raised
here, and lived in Medford.

00:23:56.225 --> 00:23:58.885
And attended, as Nancy
said, Johns Hopkins

00:23:58.885 --> 00:24:00.520
then the Harvard
Business School.

00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.980
And he told us last night
when he was growing up

00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:08.290
he wasn't much of a Red Sox fan,
but he was a rabid Celtics fan.

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.680
And when he went to games
in New York City or Boston,

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.150
where the New York Knicks
play the Boston Celtics,

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:18.800
he wouldn't cheer
for either team.

00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.870
Well, we're glad to have him
here today to speak to us.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.350
It'll be quite interesting.

00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:26.192
We've had some interesting
speeches over the year.

00:24:26.192 --> 00:24:28.250
I was looking over
the list of those

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:30.705
who have spoken
to us in the past,

00:24:30.705 --> 00:24:32.560
and if I can find
it here, I thought

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:34.570
I might mention some of
the interesting things

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:35.653
that they've talked about.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:43.440
While Rennie's
looking for his list,

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.070
we will finish the
afternoon exercises

00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:50.870
with the singing of "Fair
Harvard," the Harvard

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:55.600
alma mater, composed by Samuel
Gilman of the class of 1811.

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.060
Rennie, do you realize that he
graduated more than 200 years

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:05.310
ago and we still sing two verses
of the song that he wrote?

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:10.446
It's interesting to note that
the song that he composed

00:25:10.446 --> 00:25:14.970
read, "Fair Harvard thy
sons to the jubilee throne."

00:25:14.970 --> 00:25:16.970
And there was a
lot of discussion

00:25:16.970 --> 00:25:21.280
about this when Radcliffe
joined and merged with Harvard.

00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:24.360
And the feeling was that
the verse should be changed.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.890
And indeed it was changed
to "Fair Harvard, we

00:25:27.890 --> 00:25:30.310
join in thy jubilee throne."

00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:33.970
It's interesting to note that
Champ Lyons of the class of '62

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:36.045
was one of our
former HAA presidents

00:25:36.045 --> 00:25:40.880
and a lawyer and judge in the
southern part of the country.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.730
His recommendation was
that it would be called,

00:25:43.730 --> 00:25:47.150
suggested it be, "Fair
Harvard, thy sibs,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.550
to thy jubilee throne."

00:25:49.550 --> 00:25:54.290
And that will be the end of
our commencement afternoon

00:25:54.290 --> 00:25:55.930
exercises.

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:01.120
That will be the close of the
145th meeting of the Harvard

00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:03.690
Alumni Association.

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.520
And we will reconvene
then next year

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:13.270
on May 26, 2015 for the
145th meeting of the Alumni

00:26:13.270 --> 00:26:14.410
Association.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:17.310
I mentioned that Michael
Bloomberg, the former mayor

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:20.750
of New York City, received the
Doctor of Laws this morning.

00:26:20.750 --> 00:26:24.210
There were other honorary
degree recipients today.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:29.410
The first honorary degree that
Harvard awarded was in 1753.

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:34.170
That was more than 100 years
after Harvard was founded.

00:26:34.170 --> 00:26:36.750
The first honorary
degree in 1753

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:41.210
went to Benjamin Franklin
for his work on electricity.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.410
He was the most famous
American scientist

00:26:44.410 --> 00:26:46.300
and one of the most
famous scientists

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:48.300
in the world in his day.

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:50.520
And just think, Rennie,
now we think of him

00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:54.870
as a patriot and a politician
rather than a scientist.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.230
The other honorary degree
recipients this morning

00:26:57.230 --> 00:27:01.860
were Isabel Allende, a Doctor
of Arts for the writing

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:05.450
that she had done,
including House of Spirits.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:10.360
George Herbert Walker Bush,
former president of the United

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.240
States, received a
Doctor of Laws degree.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.780
Aretha Franklin, the
singer, the jazz singer,

00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:19.550
received a Doctor
of Arts degree.

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:23.300
Patricia King, the
lawyer, ethicist,

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.180
and Georgetown
University Law professor,

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.490
received a Doctor of Laws.

00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.960
Peter Raven, who's active in
biodiversity and biology work,

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:35.960
received a Doctor of Science.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:39.040
Seymour Slive, the
great art historian,

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.790
received a Doctor of Arts.

00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:44.780
And finally, the
economist Joseph Stieglitz

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.750
received a Doctor a Law degree.

00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:50.640
We will see some of the honorary
degree recipients on stage

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.600
this afternoon, and
we will point them out

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.310
as they come up the aisle.

00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:58.900
I commented on the
fact that we've

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.522
had some interesting speakers
at our afternoon ceremonies.

00:28:02.522 --> 00:28:04.480
You never know quite what
you're going to hear.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.430
Some of them are
better than others.

00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:10.160
But looking back
over the years, I

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.080
remember John
Lithgow in 2005, who

00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:17.870
said, "Be creative, be
useful, or be practical and be

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:18.960
generous."

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.500
And he had a book
that he had written

00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.830
at that point called Mahalia
Mouse Goes to College.

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:28.880
And I think, as I recall
it, he read the book,

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.620
and it's a children's book.

00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.650
And he dedicated
all the proceeds

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.366
to the class of 2005
that graduated that year.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:46.790
J. K. Rowling spoke at the
1999 afternoon exercises,

00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:49.130
noted that the thought
of giving the address

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:52.220
made her lose weight,
so she considered

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.980
that the event was
a win-win situation.

00:28:55.980 --> 00:28:58.370
I remember she
spoke about failure,

00:28:58.370 --> 00:29:02.500
and I thought it was so brave
to get in front of the 35,000

00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:06.220
people here in Tercentenary
Theatre and talk about failure

00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:10.060
and what it is like to fail.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:11.720
Exactly.

00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.500
Last year I didn't have a chance
to note that in the morning

00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:18.260
exercises, Mike Shinagel,
who had been head

00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:21.540
of continuing ed
for years, retired.

00:29:21.540 --> 00:29:24.960
And at the time, he noted that
he was the lame duck professor

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:29.560
who presented his graduates
for their degrees.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.410
And it reminded me of
the wonderful story

00:29:31.410 --> 00:29:35.330
that Mike tells of the fact
that when he and his wife

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:38.980
were the house masters,
or head of the house

00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.700
or whatever they're called
now, of Quincy house--

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.241
Quincy House apparently
has a roof garden,

00:29:45.241 --> 00:29:51.400
and Mr. and Mrs.
Mallard Duck took up

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.566
residence in the garden.

00:29:53.566 --> 00:29:56.950
And Mr. Mallard Duck
left, but Mrs. Mallard

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.760
stayed and laid seven eggs.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:02.940
And Mike's comment
was, "it shows you

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:05.060
to what lengths a
determined mother

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:09.150
will go to get her
children into Harvard."

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.550
It's been an interesting
year here in Harvard Square.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:16.460
There have been a number
of personnel changes.

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.170
Coming up, Rakesh
Khurana, professor

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:22.050
of sociology and Harvard
Business School professor,

00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:27.810
will become the next dean of
Harvard College on July 1.

00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.790
He and his wife are also
co-masters of Cabot House.

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:32.940
He's someone who's
dedicated to improving

00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:34.460
the lives of undergraduates.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:39.480
And so we congratulate Professor
Khurana on his appointment

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:41.135
and we look forward
to his service

00:30:41.135 --> 00:30:44.200
as dean of Harvard College.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.080
Our own Jack Reardon, Executive
Director of the Harvard Alumni

00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:54.700
Association for 20 years,
will be stepping down

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.270
from that post as
of the end of June.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.830
And Jack will
continue his service

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.920
to Harvard in various
ways, including

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.340
his work with the
athletic department.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.390
He's the former
director of athletics.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:14.850
As well as continue to work
on the development side.

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:16.240
We will miss Jack.

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:19.580
He's from the great
class of 1960,

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.287
and he has really brought
the Alumni Association

00:31:23.287 --> 00:31:27.950
to its current status
as a global community

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:32.220
of more than 350,000
of Harvard alumni.

00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.237
We just saw on the
screen a minute

00:31:34.237 --> 00:31:36.070
or two ago-- you may
have seen the gentleman

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:39.450
having his picture taken
rubbing the toe of John Harvard.

00:31:39.450 --> 00:31:40.950
There it is.

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:44.660
One of the activities that
has gone by, of course,

00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:46.920
is that in the old
days, when anybody

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.550
went by John, the
undergraduates and graduates,

00:31:49.550 --> 00:31:52.080
everybody tipped
their hat to him.

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.440
Now they rub the toe, and it's
supposed to bring good luck.

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:57.600
So if you ever come
to Harvard Yard

00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.320
and you look at
John Harvard's toe,

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.470
you realize it is completely
polished bronze because of all

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:05.190
the people who've
been touching it.

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.570
Imagine what the statute would
look like if the entire statute

00:32:08.570 --> 00:32:10.310
where that brightly
colored bronze.

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:12.230
And what you're
seeing there-- there

00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:14.480
is my classmate Alan Howl.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:18.650
And there is my good wife, I
think, somewhere in the group

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.150
there.

00:32:19.150 --> 00:32:20.525
It's nice to know
they're seated.

00:32:20.525 --> 00:32:22.080
The great class of 1955.

00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.070
1955.

00:32:23.070 --> 00:32:26.400
And I was going to note that,
of course, if you come and see

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:29.120
the John Harvard statue, you
should realize it's often

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:32.880
called the Statue of Three Lies,
because the information on it

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.240
and the picture you just
of John Harvard's head--

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.730
that's not John Harvard.

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:41.260
Nobody knows what
he looked like.

00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:46.170
Name is Sherman Hoar,
used by Donald Chester

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.740
French as the model for it.

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:53.162
And you'll also note that it
gives the date on it as 1636.

00:32:53.162 --> 00:32:56.574
And of course that's not the
date that Harvard was formed.

00:32:56.574 --> 00:32:59.350
It was formed in 1632.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:01.530
And I'm blanking
on the third one,

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:07.560
but I think that it
was not in Cambridge.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:08.498
It was Newtown.

00:33:08.498 --> 00:33:10.380
That's the third one if
I remember correctly.

00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:13.100
But anyway, there are three
lies connected with it.

00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:16.215
And we hope that everybody who's
rubbing the foot at this time

00:33:16.215 --> 00:33:18.290
is at least having
some good luck,

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.410
and perhaps we
rubbed it yesterday

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:22.410
to get the good weather, Nancy.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:24.740
One of the things I love
about Harvard commencement

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.200
is we are in the actual
place where commencement

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:31.480
have been celebrated since 1642.

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.290
In the early years of college,
the elders of the Massachusetts

00:33:35.290 --> 00:33:37.280
Bay Colony who
founded the college

00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:40.310
to train ministers
for the colony,

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.680
they were concerned that the
college wouldn't survive.

00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:46.390
And so they would come
en masse from Boston

00:33:46.390 --> 00:33:50.970
to celebrate, listen to the
orations of the graduates,

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.170
and celebrate.

00:33:52.170 --> 00:33:55.421
And the next year they invited
the alumni and the following

00:33:55.421 --> 00:33:55.920
year.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:34:00.600
So our alumni tradition
dates actually from 1643,

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:03.650
and it has always happened
right here on this site.

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:07.550
There are several
traditions that date

00:34:07.550 --> 00:34:12.570
from the 17th and 18th
century, including that beer

00:34:12.570 --> 00:34:16.510
is served free in the old
yard on commencement day.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.000
So this morning as I was
walking through the yard,

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.420
I saw the trucks being
unloaded with kegs of beer.

00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:26.389
So if you're ever in the Boston
area on commencement day,

00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:28.580
you can come during
lunch and you

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.219
will be offered a glass of beer.

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:32.489
There's another tradition.

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:35.460
Rennie, you and I both
live here in Cambridge.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:37.900
And it is in fact in
the charter of Harvard

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:42.760
that Cambridge residents
can graze their sheep

00:34:42.760 --> 00:34:44.010
in Harvard Yard.

00:34:44.010 --> 00:34:47.300
So one year I would
like to bring my sheep,

00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.260
if I ever have any, into
Harvard Yard so they can graze

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:54.060
and enjoy the commencement
festivities, as well.

00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:57.730
In the 18th century,
there would sometimes

00:34:57.730 --> 00:35:00.980
be circus animals,
including elephants,

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:04.920
and men dressed up as mermaids.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.610
And I can just imagine
seeing elephants and mermaids

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:11.330
on Harvard Yard.

00:35:11.330 --> 00:35:14.630
Unfortunately, we won't see
any of those characters today.

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:15.600
Probably not.

00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:18.260
Probably not.

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:22.125
During lunch, there was
a number of the graduates

00:35:22.125 --> 00:35:23.760
with their mortar boards on.

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.850
And the discussion came
up as to whether you

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:29.160
put your tassel on the
left and then moved it over

00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:33.143
to the right, which always comes
up at commencement whether it

00:35:33.143 --> 00:35:38.260
be at college like Harvard here
or high schools and so forth.

00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.070
And one year a graduate
wore a ponytail

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:50.000
and told those around him,
remind me when I graduate

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.250
and I'll flip my pony
tail from left to right.

00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:59.600
A nice sentiment, but there
is no meaning attached to

00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:03.640
whether the tassel
drapes right or left.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:06.980
Otherwise, an expert in such
matters has noted, quote,

00:36:06.980 --> 00:36:11.390
"a gust of wind could change
your academic standing

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:13.600
in a moment."

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.650
Thursday is our commencement
day here at Harvard, so not

00:36:17.650 --> 00:36:20.000
only the undergraduates
but the graduates

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.670
of all the professional schools
are with us in the morning

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:27.490
and in the afternoon for
the afternoon exercises.

00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:30.090
Wednesdays of
graduation week are

00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.380
what we call Class Day, where
each of the individual schools

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.170
invites a speaker.

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:41.570
So yesterday, Sheryl Sandberg,
Chief Operating Officer

00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:46.340
of Facebook, and graduate
of Harvard College '91,

00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:51.120
Harvard Business School '95,
addressed the senior class.

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:53.520
At the Kennedy School,
Samantha Power,

00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:59.830
who has a JD from Harvard,
a law degree from Harvard,

00:36:59.830 --> 00:37:04.100
class of 1999, who is currently
the US Ambassador to the United

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.220
Nations and a former professor
at the Kennedy School--

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:10.150
she spoke to the Kennedy
School graduates.

00:37:10.150 --> 00:37:13.700
The medical school
invited Vivek Murthy, who

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:18.170
is the current nominee to be the
US Surgeon General and founder

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:21.220
of Doctors for
America, addressed

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.240
the medical and dental
school graduates.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.580
At the business
school, Salman Khan,

00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:30.650
who is the founder of the
first free online education

00:37:30.650 --> 00:37:35.660
Khan Academy addressed
the MBA graduates.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:38.640
At the School of Public
Health, Thomas Friedan,

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.930
who's the director of the
Center for Disease Control,

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:45.040
talked to the graduates.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.500
At the Graduate
School of Design,

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.780
Michael Van Valkenburgh,
the professor

00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:53.680
of landscape architecture spoke.

00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:56.900
At the law school,
Preet Bharara,

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:01.420
who overseas investigation
and litigation

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:04.550
of criminal and
civil cases, was one

00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:07.130
of the speakers, along
with Mindy Kaling, who's

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:12.800
a writer and producer known for
playing Kelly Kapoor on the NBC

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.470
sitcom "The Office."

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.690
Graduate School
of Education were

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:20.850
addressed by Michael Johnston,
who's a Colorado State

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:23.400
senator and a graduate
of the ed school.

00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:25.905
And at the divinity
school, Charles Hallisey,

00:38:25.905 --> 00:38:31.890
who is a lecturer on Buddhist
literature, gave the address.

00:38:31.890 --> 00:38:34.800
So it's always a
busy couple of days.

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:39.430
Wednesday is Class Day where
each school individually

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.210
celebrates.

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:44.340
And today is the day for the
university-wide celebration.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:47.940
We're expecting probably
20,000 people today

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:51.580
here in Harvard Yard to
hear Michael Bloomberg.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:55.840
The yard can seat
as many as 35,000.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.520
And I remember for the Bill
Gates and J. K. Rowling,

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:03.440
we had 35,000,
standing room only.

00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:06.690
Not sure we'll quite reach
that, but we should easily

00:39:06.690 --> 00:39:11.220
have 20,000 people
here with us today.

00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.480
Well, it won't be as
crowded in the afternoon.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:16.240
Mornings fill up,
and we often say

00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:23.350
it's an event for the 35,000
people and 27,000 seats,

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:25.140
which makes it
somewhat difficult.

00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:30.340
But the atmosphere is such
that the university has never

00:39:30.340 --> 00:39:34.260
made any effort to
accommodate all of the parents

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:37.660
and so forth, which is difficult
for them in the morning.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:42.080
But to ever consider moving
it down to the stadium

00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:45.760
where Class Day exercises
in the old days were held

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.225
has never been considered.

00:39:47.225 --> 00:39:49.410
I think part of it is
because we're lucky enough

00:39:49.410 --> 00:39:50.946
to have a lot of
good, nice trees

00:39:50.946 --> 00:39:53.075
that are well taken
care of up here

00:39:53.075 --> 00:39:55.250
that give us a
pretty good shade.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.920
And not too many trees,
too, so the people

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.290
can't see around them.

00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:04.825
Years ago, back in 2004,
because of the crowds

00:40:04.825 --> 00:40:07.090
and because it's
difficult to see around

00:40:07.090 --> 00:40:09.820
some of the trees and
things, the university put

00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:13.544
in the first of its LED screens.

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:16.029
And we had two of
them at that time.

00:40:16.029 --> 00:40:19.240
I think we now have,
one, two, at least four

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:23.475
with an additional one put
up in the old yard where

00:40:23.475 --> 00:40:26.157
the general alumni
spread is, which

00:40:26.157 --> 00:40:28.807
helped to take care of
those who couldn't find

00:40:28.807 --> 00:40:30.735
a seat within the
stadium itself.

00:40:30.735 --> 00:40:34.490
So they have been a great help.

00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:39.970
Not only do you see them,
but because you can read

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.844
what's being said if
you can't hear it,

00:40:41.844 --> 00:40:43.580
which you generally can't.

00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:45.500
You're seeing a lot
of interesting hats

00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:47.507
as we go around here.

00:40:47.507 --> 00:40:51.160
And Nancy, I'm sure, could
tell you more about that hats,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:54.860
but I can remember having
served on the first committee

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:56.500
about women's wear.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:41:00.245
And in the old days,
women wore all white.

00:41:00.245 --> 00:41:02.050
It was dictated
they all wore white.

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:05.510
Now, as I understand
it, that's not something

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:09.440
that every good-looking
woman has in their wardrobe.

00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:12.320
So we had quite a
committee put together,

00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.672
because it was white
with a red sash.

00:41:14.672 --> 00:41:20.230
The red sash was attached with
a carnation at the bottom,

00:41:20.230 --> 00:41:24.310
and in some cases, a
very [INAUDIBLE] hat

00:41:24.310 --> 00:41:26.970
that was just awful.

00:41:26.970 --> 00:41:30.650
And we had a meeting on this,
and there was a lot of venting.

00:41:30.650 --> 00:41:32.830
In fact, at the
meeting-- it took place,

00:41:32.830 --> 00:41:34.980
I think, at one of
the HAA meetings

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:46.990
in the Commonwealth HAA,
the Commonwealth office

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:50.580
of the Harvard Club of Boston.

00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.810
And Myra Mayman,
who at that time

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:56.850
was the head of the arts,
which Jack Megan now is,

00:41:56.850 --> 00:42:03.560
Myra got quite excited about
this and got going on it.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:07.105
And the alarm went off.

00:42:07.105 --> 00:42:11.432
The fire alarm went off, and
we had to vacate the building.

00:42:11.432 --> 00:42:16.030
But we then changed the ruling
to that you could either

00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:19.920
wear black or white, but
you couldn't wear both

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:23.240
because then you'd look like
the Harvard dining services.

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:27.170
Rennie, now we see the
stage is filling up

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:31.850
with the 25th reunion class,
as well as the honorary degree

00:42:31.850 --> 00:42:35.870
recipients and the
dignitaries, our speakers

00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:37.090
for this afternoon.

00:42:37.090 --> 00:42:41.630
So I think in a few minutes,
we will be starting.

00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:43.960
You see the banners
in the trees.

00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.530
Each of the banners represents
one school of Harvard

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.650
and also the Harvard
undergraduate houses.

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:54.160
Undergraduates at Harvard
don't live in dormitories.

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.080
They live in what are
called the houses,

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.450
and each house has its symbol.

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.960
Each house has
its co-masters who

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:04.840
really organize the
administrative lives

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:05.930
of the students.

00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:09.750
Sophomores, juniors, and
seniors live in the houses,

00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:13.180
and freshman all
live in Harvard Yard.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.360
So there you can see
a view of the crowd

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:20.700
that we are seeing from here,
some of the estimated 20,000

00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.370
people who will be here today.

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:26.320
And now I believe we're
looking at the stage, which

00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.375
is-- yes, there on the right,
you see Alan Garber, class

00:43:29.375 --> 00:43:32.630
of 1977, who is our provost.

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:37.510
He is sitting, waiting for
the ceremonies to begin.

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:39.460
The woman on the left
in the white jacket

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:42.140
is Katie Lapp, the
executive vice president

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:44.160
of the university
who is in charge

00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:47.930
of all of the administrative
aspects of the university.

00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:56.520
And you'll see other of the
dignitaries there on the stage.

00:43:56.520 --> 00:44:00.030
Many people are still standing,
waiting for the procession

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:00.770
to conclude.

00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:05.230
Here comes the president's
procession up the center aisle.

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:11.760
So as the president's
procession comes to the stage,

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:17.450
we will begin our
afternoon program.

00:44:17.450 --> 00:44:20.490
What we see in the lead
there is the Chief Marshal

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:22.970
and his aides.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.545
That's A-I-D-E-S. In the
morning, they are A-I-D-S,

00:44:26.545 --> 00:44:27.920
and we have to
get that straight.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.480
The Chief Marshal is the
one with the red-- looks

00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.430
like a red ribbon or a red
corsage, on the left side.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.170
And there is the bell signaling
the beginning of the afternoon

00:44:39.170 --> 00:44:39.760
program.

00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.292
So as soon as the
president and fellows--

00:44:42.292 --> 00:44:44.625
you'll see the sign there for
the president and fellows.

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:45.170
You see--

00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:46.503
There's the president coming in.

00:44:46.503 --> 00:44:49.300
--President Drew Faust on the
right with her white jacket

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.730
with dark trim.

00:44:50.730 --> 00:44:52.975
And on the left,
in the middle you

00:44:52.975 --> 00:44:56.880
see Jack Reardon, the Executive
Director of the Alumni

00:44:56.880 --> 00:45:01.240
Association, class of
1960, who's stepping down.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.530
And to the left of the
screen is Kate Gellert,

00:45:03.530 --> 00:45:08.330
who's the current president of
the Harvard Alumni Association.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:11.860
Behind them are the directors
of the Alumni Association,

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.920
former directors, current
directors, and members

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.106
of various committees
that have served

00:45:17.106 --> 00:45:20.440
in the Alumni Association.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:24.540
And you can hear the bell
from Memorial Church signaling

00:45:24.540 --> 00:45:26.550
the beginning of the
afternoon program.

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:30.630
That's a signal for people
to take their seats.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:37.950
And we will continue to talk
until Kate Gellert opens

00:45:37.950 --> 00:45:41.521
the meeting with the
pounding of her gavel.

00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:53.595
We hear from time to
time the music coming up

00:45:53.595 --> 00:45:55.870
from University Hall.

00:45:55.870 --> 00:45:59.110
The stage next to the east
side of the University Hall

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:02.320
was built for the band in 2001.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.670
There we see the Dean of
Faculty of Arts and Science,

00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.050
Michael Smith.

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:11.680
And there we see the
medalists that we mentioned,

00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:14.780
Anand Mahindra, Emily Pulitzer.

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.430
And normally Louis Newell
would be there as well,

00:46:17.430 --> 00:46:20.856
but unfortunately he wasn't
able to do be there today.

00:46:20.856 --> 00:46:24.470
For a long time, it was
difficult to figure out

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:27.640
who was who, especially if
they didn't have a name tag.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:31.940
Now, with the signs,
it's very helpful

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:34.475
because we can line
people up behind the signs

00:46:34.475 --> 00:46:37.470
and make sure that
everybody's there.

00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:41.360
Not everybody wants
to be in parading.

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:43.810
As I said, we don't see too
many of the undergraduates who

00:46:43.810 --> 00:46:46.060
have been down at their
houses getting their diplomas.

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.855
There's President Faust
with, to her left,

00:46:48.855 --> 00:46:53.380
Jim Rothenberg, the current
treasurer of the university.

00:46:53.380 --> 00:46:58.760
He will be stepping down from
that post as of July 1 to be

00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:03.570
replaced by Paul Finnegan,
who's the class of '75, MBA '82.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.055
Paul is the former president of
the Harvard Alumni Association.

00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:24.810
There is a good
view of the crowd.

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:29.010
So I would say we're
about half full.

00:47:29.010 --> 00:47:32.600
What happens is the
graduates have all

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:35.070
gone somewhere back to
their schools for lunch,

00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.170
and as the afternoon wears
on, more and more of them

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:42.180
will be coming to hear
Michael Bloomberg speak.

00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:45.910
So we will see the chairs fill
up as the afternoon progresses.

00:47:45.910 --> 00:47:48.712
There's a good
view of the stage.

00:47:48.712 --> 00:47:51.580
The podium is to the
right of your screen,

00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:53.550
where you see the flowers.

00:47:53.550 --> 00:47:57.625
And you see the dignitaries,
the overseers, the president

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:01.120
and fellows, the honorary
degree recipients

00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:03.630
on the stage starting
to take their seats

00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:05.435
so we can begin our program.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:12.480
Most of the older classes
have now been seated.

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.930
Class of '54 is having
their 60th reunion.

00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:18.700
That's Ted Kennedy's
class, John Calder's class,

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:19.690
and John Updike.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:23.850
And I should note that John
Updike-- Houghton Library has

00:48:23.850 --> 00:48:28.420
a display of Updike's
special exhibit,

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:32.520
from 1950 to 1954
of his writings,

00:48:32.520 --> 00:48:37.340
which he gave to the
Houghton Library.

00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:39.960
There is Kate Gellert,
our president,

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.610
the woman in the white dress
who has just taken her seat.

00:48:43.610 --> 00:48:46.140
She's getting ready
for the afternoon.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:56.250
We have quite a crew whose job
both morning and afternoon--

00:48:56.250 --> 00:49:00.880
in the morning, the seats are
all done by the university.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:03.690
In the afternoon, we have a
crew from the Happy Committee

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:09.510
that helps to set up the
seating for those on the podium.

00:49:09.510 --> 00:49:13.580
The older classes sit on the
far left, as we have, as I said,

00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:18.700
the bigger tent now than
in the old days and one

00:49:18.700 --> 00:49:19.850
that doesn't leak.

00:49:19.850 --> 00:49:24.060
Fortunately, we don't have
to worry about the [? rain ?]

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.980
plants, so we don't
even mention it.

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:29.970
And there we have a good view
of the podium with the flowers.

00:49:29.970 --> 00:49:34.521
That's where the speakers
will be addressing the crowd.

00:49:34.521 --> 00:49:38.130
And you can see the cage
where the different cameras

00:49:38.130 --> 00:49:38.630
are located.

00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:44.660
There's a good view of the
flowers in front of the podium.

00:49:51.859 --> 00:49:54.150
So, Rennie, we're getting a
little bit of a late start.

00:49:54.150 --> 00:49:58.990
We like to start by about
2:30, so right now we're

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:02.410
about seven minutes
behind schedule.

00:50:02.410 --> 00:50:08.470
Normally, commencement ends at
somewhere between 4:00 and 4:15

00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.970
PM.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:14.465
We'll see if we can keep
to that schedule today.

00:50:14.465 --> 00:50:15.340
Good afternoon.

00:50:18.820 --> 00:50:19.856
Good afternoon.

00:50:23.310 --> 00:50:31.190
Honored guests, fellow alumni,
family and friends, my mom

00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:37.410
and dad, it's wonderful
to see you all here.

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:43.627
Welcome to the 145th annual
meeting of the Harvard Alumni

00:50:43.627 --> 00:50:44.126
Association.

00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:59.246
I am Kate Gellert, member of
the college class of 1993.

00:50:59.246 --> 00:51:05.500
As the 135th president of the
Harvard Alumni Association,

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:09.170
the HAA for short,
and in accordance

00:51:09.170 --> 00:51:14.970
with the tradition set by our
very first HAA president, John

00:51:14.970 --> 00:51:21.665
Quincy Adams, I raise this gavel
and call this meeting to order.

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:35.990
This morning after
receiving their degrees

00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:39.080
from the college and
the graduate schools,

00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:45.490
6,500 new alumni
joined our ranks.

00:51:45.490 --> 00:51:49.570
All graduates automatically
become lifelong members

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:54.510
of the HAA, with the many
privileges and resources

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:59.250
we hope to help you discover
in the coming years.

00:51:59.250 --> 00:52:04.040
Congratulations, and welcome
to an astounding community

00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:07.665
made only richer by
your presence among us.

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:20.600
I also want to congratulate
your parents, your families,

00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:25.700
and friends, faculty, and
staff across the university,

00:52:25.700 --> 00:52:28.320
the people who have
believed in you

00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:33.180
and supported you throughout
your time at Harvard,

00:52:33.180 --> 00:52:37.120
and those that are
not with us here today

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.990
but who would be
very proud and who

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:44.610
are very much here
with us in spirit.

00:52:44.610 --> 00:52:46.780
When the Harvard
Alumni Association

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:52.880
was founded in 1840, there
were no more than 10,000 living

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:54.590
alumni.

00:52:54.590 --> 00:53:01.610
Today, you have joined over
320,000 Harvard alumni,

00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:06.320
including 17% living
outside of the United States

00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:10.250
in 189 countries.

00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:15.130
We want to welcome you,
and we want to celebrate.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:19.400
So please turn in your
program and join me

00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:24.660
in singing "Gaudeamus
Igitur," or in English,

00:53:24.660 --> 00:53:29.313
"So Let Us Rejoice."

00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:09.275
Why did we just sing
that song in Latin?

00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:16.030
Why am I wearing a hat?

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:19.530
And just what does
the Happy Committee

00:55:19.530 --> 00:55:24.390
for the Observance
of Commencement do?

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:28.640
Today is a celebration of
Harvard's most enduring

00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.530
traditions.

00:55:30.530 --> 00:55:33.560
We will end this
afternoon singing

00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:37.270
our alma mater, "Fair Harvard."

00:55:37.270 --> 00:55:40.280
In the second line
of the song, it

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:44.740
will talk about the pageantry
that has unfolded today,

00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:49.510
referring to these
festival rights.

00:55:49.510 --> 00:55:52.690
Some of you in the
audience are participating

00:55:52.690 --> 00:55:56.310
in these festive rights
for the first time.

00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:59.810
Some people are here
today for the first time

00:55:59.810 --> 00:56:01.890
since they graduated.

00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:06.740
And some come back every year.

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.280
I was curious.

00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:12.310
What did commencement
look like 50 years ago?

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:15.320
Are we still flying
the same banners,

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.450
singing the same songs?

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:21.800
I did some research
about this and went

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:27.250
where all good researchers go,
to the archives of The Crimson,

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:33.050
where I found an article dated
Commencement Day, June 11,

00:56:33.050 --> 00:56:34.640
1964.

00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:40.420
And I quote, "Aside
from Thanksgiving,

00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.970
the commencement pageantry
which will gradually

00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:49.660
unravel in the yard this
morning is America's oldest

00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:52.650
continuous festival.

00:56:52.650 --> 00:56:56.450
By its forthright
uniqueness, it is also

00:56:56.450 --> 00:57:03.110
one of the most enduring
signs of everlasting Harvard."

00:57:03.110 --> 00:57:08.990
Hopefully, you, like me,
are proud of our traditions.

00:57:08.990 --> 00:57:12.830
And I am honored
through the HAA to have

00:57:12.830 --> 00:57:17.810
been the custodian of
them this past year.

00:57:17.810 --> 00:57:20.360
In the spirit of
an annual meeting,

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:26.630
I feel obliged to report on some
of the activities of the HAA.

00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:30.800
As the university launched
the Harvard Campaign,

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:36.440
the HAA focused on how our
alumni connect, with each other

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.340
and with the university.

00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.830
Knowing that our alumni
desire intellectual content,

00:57:43.830 --> 00:57:48.430
we launched HarvardX for
alumni, a survey course

00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:52.530
of Harvard's offerings
on the EdX platform.

00:57:52.530 --> 00:57:57.020
Wanting to connect alumni with
campus and student life today,

00:57:57.020 --> 00:58:01.670
we launched a series called
Your Harvard, in which President

00:58:01.670 --> 00:58:06.700
Faust shares her vision for
the future of the university.

00:58:06.700 --> 00:58:11.130
Hundreds of alumni attended
in London, Los Angeles,

00:58:11.130 --> 00:58:12.790
and New York.

00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:15.560
Mark your calendars
for the series dates

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:21.220
in Dallas, Seattle,
and Chicago next year.

00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:25.030
Recognizing the unique
reach of our club network,

00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:28.000
we held regional
conferences in Europe,

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:32.350
South America, Asia, as
well as here in Cambridge,

00:58:32.350 --> 00:58:36.780
to connect our volunteers with
university leadership, faculty,

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.470
and staff.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:43.540
Throughout my travels
this year, one theme

00:58:43.540 --> 00:58:47.340
emerged over and over.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:51.480
Attending Harvard, no
matter what school,

00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:54.960
was a transformative experience.

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:59.000
When our alumni talk
about their time here,

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:02.030
they talk about
being challenged,

00:59:02.030 --> 00:59:05.600
about looking
differently at the world,

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.880
about making lifelong
friends, and about learning

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:13.920
what is possible
to achieve in life.

00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:18.830
The role of the HAA is not only
to keep our alumni connected

00:59:18.830 --> 00:59:23.120
to the traditions of Harvard,
but also to keep people,

00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.630
near or far away,
days or decades

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:30.010
removed, connected to
the vibrant university

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.160
life that transformed them.

00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:39.050
It has been a great,
really great privilege

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:44.010
and also pleasure to have served
in this role as the trustee

00:59:44.010 --> 00:59:47.680
of great traditions,
as well as laying plans

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:49.570
to shape the future.

00:59:49.570 --> 00:59:50.140
Thank you.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:05.540
Now, in a most humbling
and inspiring tradition,

01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:08.890
we recognize the
two senior alumni

01:00:08.890 --> 01:00:13.300
who led the alumni
parade this afternoon.

01:00:13.300 --> 01:00:17.120
From the Radcliffe
class of 1937,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:21.210
Lillian Sugarman, who
turned 98 last year.

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:43.170
And from the Harvard class
of 1939, Robert Rothschild,

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:46.840
who celebrated his 95th
birthday this past January.

01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:04.880
Thank you for leading
our alumni parade.

01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:09.490
It is an honor to
celebrate you today.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:12.270
And now, it is my
privilege to present

01:01:12.270 --> 01:01:18.520
a member of the class of 1989,
elected by his classmates

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.960
to serve as Chief Marshal
on the occasion of this,

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:26.120
their 25th reunion.

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:29.270
After this year's Chief
Marshal graduated,

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:32.080
he helped start
Teach for America,

01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.810
along with a number
of other Harvard folk.

01:01:35.810 --> 01:01:38.630
For the past nine
years, he has led

01:01:38.630 --> 01:01:42.510
the Knowledge Is Power
Program Foundation, which

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:47.790
oversees the national network
of KIPP public charter schools.

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:51.680
Under his tenure, KIPP
has tripled in size,

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.950
now serving more than 50,000
students across the country.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:02:00.620
In communities were roughly
half of the students drop out

01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.680
of high school, KIPP
is proving that it

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.700
doesn't have to be this way.

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:13.540
Among KIPP students, 93%
graduate high school and 83%

01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:14.540
go on to college.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:27.850
Today we recognize
a fellow alumnus

01:02:27.850 --> 01:02:30.740
who has committed his
life to helping students

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:34.170
succeed despite great obstacles.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:37.405
Ladies and gentlemen, Chief
Marshal Richard Barth.

01:02:56.186 --> 01:03:01.060
And will the entire 25th
reunion class seated on stage

01:03:01.060 --> 01:03:03.673
this afternoon please
stand and be recognized?

01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:25.550
On June 30, I will, with some
reluctance and some relief,

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:29.950
turn over the gavel to one
of the alumni association's

01:03:29.950 --> 01:03:33.080
most enthusiastic supporters.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:36.120
A member of the
college class of 1980

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:39.550
and business school
class of 1984,

01:03:39.550 --> 01:03:42.250
Cynthia Torres has
given generously

01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:44.870
of her time and
energy from coast

01:03:44.870 --> 01:03:48.610
to coast and indeed
around the world.

01:03:48.610 --> 01:03:51.220
Hailing from
Southern California,

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:54.040
she has led the
local club there,

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.400
as well as being
active in career

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:59.270
mentoring for current students.

01:03:59.270 --> 01:04:02.920
I am excited for
Cynthia, because I

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:07.850
am sure she has no
idea just how much fun

01:04:07.850 --> 01:04:10.660
is in store for her next year.

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:14.280
I know I leave the
HAA in great hands.

01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.111
Ms. President-elect Cynthia
Torres, will you please stand?

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.900
Let me also recognize a
distinguished alumnus who

01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:43.700
will step down this June after
18 years of consecutive service

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:49.360
on Harvard's governing
boards, six as an overseer,

01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:52.760
12 as a member of
the corporation,

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:57.460
and the last four as the
corporation's senior fellow.

01:04:57.460 --> 01:05:00.680
Please join me in
applauding and thanking

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.740
an extraordinary leader
in Harvard's governance

01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:06.320
over the past two decades,
Robert Reischauer.

01:05:22.420 --> 01:05:24.900
Next, it is my
pleasure to announce

01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:28.440

spring's elections

We are grateful to the entire

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:43.100
to be of service to the
governance of Harvard.

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:48.760

Please hold your applause until

to working with

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:56.640
to shape Harvard's future.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.160
At this annual meeting, the
Harvard Alumni Association

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:06.040
confers the Harvard
Medal, our highest honor

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:10.080
for extraordinary service
to the university.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.420
We recognize those
whose devotion

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:17.569
has been exemplary
and inspirational.

01:08:17.569 --> 01:08:20.359
President Faust will

01:08:20.359 --> 01:08:23.910
Will each medalist please stand

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:40.830
Anand Mahindra, AB '77,
MBA '81, distinguished

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:45.130
graduate of Harvard College
and Harvard Business School,

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:49.040
you have served the university
on several continents

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:54.210
with deep devotion and insight,
affirming the vital importance

01:08:54.210 --> 01:08:57.160
of the humanities
while advancing

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.420
interdisciplinary studies within
a broad liberal arts education.

01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:02.920
Anand.

01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:25.779
Our next medalist,
Louis Newell, is not

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.770
able to be here with us to
receive his Harvard Medal

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:29.790
today.

01:09:29.790 --> 01:09:33.029
Although we will hold a
special medal presentation

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:37.859
at a later date, I want to
share his citation with you.

01:09:37.859 --> 01:09:42.550
J. Louis Newell, AB
'57, whether cheering

01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:46.340
from the stands at the stadium
or chairing the committee

01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:49.420
charged with making
commencement happy,

01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:53.569
you stand always ready
to answer Harvard's call

01:09:53.569 --> 01:09:58.150
as a stalwart leader of your
class of the Harvard College

01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.800
Fund, the Harvard
Club of Boston,

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.610
and the Harvard Varsity Club.

01:10:02.610 --> 01:10:04.339
Let us applaud Louis Newell.

01:10:14.620 --> 01:10:22.390
Emily Rauh Pulitzer, AM
'63, as Harvard Overseer,

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:25.230
expert in modern and
contemporary art,

01:10:25.230 --> 01:10:29.170
and devoted friend of
Harvard's art museums,

01:10:29.170 --> 01:10:34.860
you have elevated the university
and its embrace of creativity

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:40.300
through your profound belief in
the power of art and education

01:10:40.300 --> 01:10:43.320
to transform how we
look at the world.

01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.130
I'm now pleased to
present a special Harvard

01:11:05.130 --> 01:11:56.458
Medal to John P.
Reardon, Jr., AB 1960.

01:11:56.458 --> 01:11:58.480
How you doing?

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.640
Want a speech?

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:02.360
I'm hoping we didn't
give him a heart attack.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:03.230
You're OK?

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:04.540
OK.

01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.410
From admissions to
athletics to alumni affairs,

01:12:09.410 --> 01:12:12.670
you have shaped the
Harvard we know and love,

01:12:12.670 --> 01:12:15.870
touching and changing
countless lives

01:12:15.870 --> 01:12:19.220
through your skillful
leadership and sage

01:12:19.220 --> 01:12:21.970
counsel, your
inpeccable judgment,

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:25.050
and inimitable way with people.

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:29.043
The whole Harvard family
salutes you and thanks you.

01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:50.900
I hope you can all
appreciate how much fun it

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:53.410
was to keep a secret
from the man who

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:57.200
knows everything about Harvard.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.200
And now, we will
actually hear from Jack

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:05.940
in a video about why he
has dedicated and continues

01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:08.215
to dedicate his life to Harvard.

01:13:13.860 --> 01:13:16.320
Harvard's been from the
beginning very important

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.180
in my life.

01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:21.630
I was surrounded by classmates
who, in the dining halls,

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:24.450
in my living
situation, were always

01:13:24.450 --> 01:13:26.770
wanting to discuss
issues, issues in ways

01:13:26.770 --> 01:13:29.800
sometimes that I had never
given a lot of consideration.

01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:33.720
Plus faculty, professors,
who were really great.

01:13:33.720 --> 01:13:37.140
Professor Brzezinski
was my sophomore tutor.

01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.080
I remember at the
beginning of the year

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:42.245
I was late to a meeting and
he said to me, I'm busy, too.

01:13:42.245 --> 01:13:44.550
If you can't be on time,
don't bother to come.

01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:45.830
And I got the point.

01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:48.596
That helped me to
be on time places.

01:13:48.596 --> 01:13:52.890
I think opening opportunities
to as many people who

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:56.790
can take advantage of
what's here as possible

01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:57.860
is a great thing.

01:13:57.860 --> 01:14:01.620
I had a good example
of a person years

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.060
ago who I recruited who was
a very good football player,

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:08.020
listed in the Parade High School
All-Americans as a top player.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.580
We looked at those
kids one year,

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.330
and this is the one person
who looked like maybe they

01:14:11.330 --> 01:14:12.370
could do Harvard work.

01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:14.234
Basically, he was an orphan.

01:14:14.234 --> 01:14:16.400
He was probably going to
go to Washington or Oregon.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:16.900
Forget him.

01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:18.560
I said, forget him?

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.710
Let's get him back here.

01:14:20.710 --> 01:14:21.240
He came.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.730
He played three
years of football.

01:14:22.730 --> 01:14:23.600
He went to work.

01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:25.480
Very, very successful guy.

01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.320
And more recently, he
provided some money

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:31.430
for the admissions office
to spend finding kids

01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:33.890
that you otherwise
wouldn't find.

01:14:33.890 --> 01:14:37.570
I think there are opportunities
like never before.

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:41.710
I think Harvard was very
much a local institution

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:44.830
50 years ago compared
to the way it is today.

01:14:44.830 --> 01:14:48.050
In the last 50 years,
throughout the university

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:51.210
the diversity is huge,
tremendous change.

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:54.270
It's just a very different
group of people here today

01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:56.870
than were here 50 years ago.

01:14:56.870 --> 01:15:00.970
We have great resources--
libraries, labs, and so forth--

01:15:00.970 --> 01:15:04.420
but the people that are drawn
here as students, and faculty,

01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:07.910
and staff want to
work with each other.

01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:10.330
And whatever they do, they
want to do it really well.

01:15:10.330 --> 01:15:12.870
I was lucky to meet
very special people

01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:14.450
through being at Harvard.

01:15:14.450 --> 01:15:16.510
And they certainly made
a difference to Harvard,

01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:18.370
and they made a
difference for my thinking

01:15:18.370 --> 01:15:21.340
about how to do things in life.

01:15:21.340 --> 01:15:24.650
Most alumni have had
ultimately good experiences.

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:27.060
They want to see
the place strong

01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:32.570
and want to support it in ways
that can help it be strong.

01:15:32.570 --> 01:15:36.301
It also suggests that overall
people had good experiences

01:15:36.301 --> 01:15:38.550
that they think have made a
difference in their lives,

01:15:38.550 --> 01:15:41.240
and they want to see the
strength of the place continue.

01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:44.540
The one thing that is very
special, and a lot of people

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:47.720
don't know it, but Harvard
is a very human place.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.300
You think of the bricks
and the concrete,

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.120
but I think they do
support one another.

01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.600
I think it's an unusually
human place where

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:56.580
people do care
about one another.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.130
It's been a spectacular
place to spend my life.

01:16:15.710 --> 01:16:18.680
I would like to
congratulate Jack

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:21.710
and all of the
Harvard Medalists.

01:16:21.710 --> 01:16:25.890
Except for Jack, one of the best
things I got to do this year

01:16:25.890 --> 01:16:29.470
was to call each winner
and share the exciting news

01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:32.080
with them.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:38.150
So we are all citizens
of this great university.

01:16:38.150 --> 01:16:41.660
And our medalists today
are representative

01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:47.560
of the incredible dedication
of our alumni to Harvard.

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:51.670
They are joined by a
core of tens of thousands

01:16:51.670 --> 01:16:56.100
of alumni who give of
their time and their talent

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.220
to support Harvard.

01:16:58.220 --> 01:17:02.930
Our 234 Harvard clubs and
shared interest groups

01:17:02.930 --> 01:17:05.910
are run by volunteers.

01:17:05.910 --> 01:17:11.680
Over 15,000 alumni interview
applicants to Harvard College

01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:13.530
each year.

01:17:13.530 --> 01:17:20.040
Nearly 10,000 alumni and guests
return to campus university

01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:25.400
wide to attend
volunteer-run reunions.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:29.360
So as we celebrate
today, we also

01:17:29.360 --> 01:17:35.160
give thanks to our alumni and
friends, students and parents,

01:17:35.160 --> 01:17:37.530
faculty and staff.

01:17:37.530 --> 01:17:39.300
Thank you.

01:17:39.300 --> 01:17:44.620
Thank you for all that you
do for this great university.

01:17:44.620 --> 01:17:49.250
To all the volunteers committed
to connecting Harvard's alumni,

01:17:49.250 --> 01:17:54.200
thank you for all that you have
done this year and all that you

01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:57.470
will continue to do.

01:17:57.470 --> 01:18:02.060
This week, thousands of
alumni returned to campus

01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:07.600
in a great show of commitment
to the community of Harvard.

01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:12.250
Many come back for Harvard
and Radcliffe college reunions

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:18.530
to reconnect with each other, to
experience the campus of today,

01:18:18.530 --> 01:18:23.090
and they show their support
through impressive levels

01:18:23.090 --> 01:18:24.950
of giving.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.940
Under the leadership
of many volunteers,

01:18:27.940 --> 01:18:31.120
including college reunion
committees and the class

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:33.720
secretaries and
treasurers, we've

01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:38.950
drawn more than 6,500 alumni and
guests to Cambridge this week

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:46.530
and helped generate nearly
5,400 gifts as of May 28.

01:18:46.530 --> 01:18:50.660
Today, we take a moment to
recognize some particularly

01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:54.860
impressive college
reunion efforts.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:19:01.130
The class of 1964 celebrating
their 50th reunion

01:19:01.130 --> 01:19:05.720
is led by reunion programs
co-chairs Thomas Brome

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:11.320
and Harriet Todd and reunion
campaign committee co-chairs

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:18.860
Tom Brome, C. Boyden Gray, Tom
Stevenson, and Jim Schwartz.

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:23.040
The class of '64 has 800
classmates and guests

01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:28.510
in attendance and has
raised more than $28 million

01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:32.870
to date from almost
50% of their class.

01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:34.758
Would all of you please stand?

01:19:53.060 --> 01:19:56.675
And now to this
year's 25th reunion.

01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:06.530
The class of 1989, under the
leadership reunion program

01:20:06.530 --> 01:20:11.895
co-chairs Jeff Behrens, Carolyn
Magnani, and Lori Rutter.

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:29.060
And with over a dozen reunion
campaign co-chairs-- and yes,

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:34.850
I'm going to read them--
Peter Chung, Dave Goldberg,

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:42.360
Ken Griffin, Patrick Healy,
David Heller, Jerry Jordan,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:48.760
[? Amis ?] [? Marone, ?] John
Moon, Kristin Williams Mugford,

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:54.190
Scott Nathan, Valerie
Peltier, Charlie Ryan,

01:20:54.190 --> 01:20:57.360
and Sophocles Zoullas.

01:20:57.360 --> 01:21:02.280
The class of 1989 has
generated impressive attendance

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:07.500
and giving with 1,900 classmates
and guests in attendance

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:14.320
and an astonishing record--
an astonishing record--

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:20.342
of nearly $180 million
dollars contributed to date.

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:24.770
would all of you please stand?

01:21:24.770 --> 01:21:26.738
Please stand and be recognized.

01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:52.820
Included in the class of
1989's incredible total

01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:57.850
is the transformative gift
Ken Griffin made to support

01:21:57.850 --> 01:22:02.050
financial aid, the
largest individual gift

01:22:02.050 --> 01:22:03.355
in the college's history.

01:22:15.460 --> 01:22:21.110
His generosity ensures that
future generations of Harvard

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:25.310
students will be able to
come to Cambridge regardless

01:22:25.310 --> 01:22:27.060
of their financial background.

01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:29.175
And I would like to give
him special recognition.

01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:03.610
One more person needs
special recognition.

01:23:03.610 --> 01:23:08.600
A former president of the
HAA and former co-chair

01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.680
of the Harvard College Fund,
he helped lead his class

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.580
to set a new 60th
reunion record.

01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:20.190
Would Charlie Egan
of the class of 1954

01:23:20.190 --> 01:23:21.996
please stand and be recognized?

01:23:35.470 --> 01:23:39.980
And now would all the members
of the Harvard College Reunion

01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:43.600
Program Committees and
Reunion Campaign Committees

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.150
please stand and be recognized?

01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:49.260
Thank you for your hard work
on behalf of the college.

01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:10.360
And now, a final word
of thanks to our newest

01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:21.340
alumni, the class of 2014.

01:24:21.340 --> 01:24:25.200
The Senior Class Committee,
which throughout the year

01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:29.810
has brought their class
together through over 20 events,

01:24:29.810 --> 01:24:35.000
including Class Day yesterday,
is represented on stage today

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:38.680
by Jin Zhou and Christopher
Cleveland, the first

01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:41.080
and second Class Marshals.

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:43.390
In addition, under
the leadership

01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:50.670
of Arleen Chien, Preetha Hebbar,
Tara Lyons, Kavya Shankar,

01:24:50.670 --> 01:24:56.060
and Joshua Zhang, 78%
of the class of 2014

01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.380
contributed to
their senior gift.

01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:00.700
Would the Marshals
Senior Gift co-chairs

01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:02.510
please stand and be recognized?

01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:03.176
Congratulations.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:25.070
To all of you, our dedicated
citizens of Harvard,

01:25:25.070 --> 01:25:29.350
we continue to be inspired
by your volunteerism

01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:31.630
and philanthropy.

01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:32.510
Thank you.

01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:36.110
To celebrates these
amazing volunteers

01:25:36.110 --> 01:25:39.780
and our entire alumni
community, please

01:25:39.780 --> 01:25:44.670
join the Harvard University
Band and the commencement choir

01:25:44.670 --> 01:25:50.354
in their performance
of "Harvardiana."

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:04.570
The band got to practice
that song a lot in Spokane

01:28:04.570 --> 01:28:07.210
this winter.

01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:12.470
Harvard's 21st president,
Charles W. Eliot,

01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:18.670
in his inaugural address
145 years ago said,

01:28:18.670 --> 01:28:25.886
quote, "The inertia of a massive
university is formidable.

01:28:25.886 --> 01:28:29.830
A good past is
positively dangerous

01:28:29.830 --> 01:28:33.760
if it makes us content
with the present

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:38.620
and thus unprepared
for the future."

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:43.550
Harvard's 28th president,
Drew Gilpin Faust,

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:46.680
has demonstrated
dynamic leadership

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:51.150
under which there
could be no inertia.

01:28:51.150 --> 01:28:54.410
In the past seven
years, President Faust

01:28:54.410 --> 01:29:00.160
has expanded financial aid to
improve access to a Harvard

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.190
education for students from
all economic backgrounds,

01:29:05.190 --> 01:29:08.420
advocated for increased
federal funding

01:29:08.420 --> 01:29:12.450
for scientific
research, broadened

01:29:12.450 --> 01:29:19.020
the university's global reach,
raised the profile of the arts

01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:24.390
on campus, and this past
fall, launched the Harvard

01:29:24.390 --> 01:29:27.640
Campaign, an
ambitious fundraising

01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:32.270
campaign to position
Harvard, in her words,

01:29:32.270 --> 01:29:36.060
to seize an impatient future.

01:29:36.060 --> 01:29:40.500
Please join me in welcoming the
Lincoln Professor of History,

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.662
Harvard's 28th president,
Drew Gilpin Faust.

01:29:49.566 --> 01:29:50.542
Thank you.

01:29:50.542 --> 01:29:51.042
Thank you.

01:29:54.970 --> 01:29:55.470
Goodness.

01:30:00.390 --> 01:30:01.858
Thank you.

01:30:01.858 --> 01:30:02.358
Thank you.

01:30:08.290 --> 01:30:12.710
Thank you all, and good
afternoon, alumni, graduates,

01:30:12.710 --> 01:30:15.990
families, friends,
honored guests.

01:30:15.990 --> 01:30:21.040
For seven years now, it has been
my assignment and my privilege

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.350
to deliver an annual
report to our alumni

01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:30.150
and to serve as the warm-up act
for our distinguished speaker.

01:30:30.150 --> 01:30:32.600
Whether this is your
first opportunity

01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.980
to be part of these
exercises or your 50th,

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:40.090
it's worth taking a minute
to soak in this place,

01:30:40.090 --> 01:30:43.310
its sheltering trees,
its familiar buildings,

01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:45.820
its enduring voices.

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:49.180
In 1936, this part
of Harvard Yard

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:54.190
was called Tercentenary
Theatre in recognition

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:57.150
of Harvard's 300th birthday.

01:30:57.150 --> 01:30:59.910
It's a place where
giants have stood

01:30:59.910 --> 01:31:02.750
and history has been made.

01:31:02.750 --> 01:31:06.840
We were reminded this morning of
George Washington's adventures

01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.110
here.

01:31:08.110 --> 01:31:12.260
And from this stage in
1943, Winston Churchill

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:15.660
addressed an overflow
crowd that included

01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:21.190
6,000 uniformed Harvard
students heading off to war.

01:31:21.190 --> 01:31:23.940
He said that he hoped
the young recruits would

01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:27.570
come to regard the British
soldiers and sailors they would

01:31:27.570 --> 01:31:32.040
soon fight alongside as
their brothers in arms.

01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:37.920
And he assured the audience that
we shall never tire nor weaken

01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:42.960
but march with you to
establish the reign of justice

01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:44.900
and of law.

01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:48.660
Four years later
in this same place,

01:31:48.660 --> 01:31:52.930
George Marshall introduced a
plan that aided reconstruction

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:55.400
across war-stricken Europe.

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:59.840
And he ended his speech
by asking, what is needed?

01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.310
What best can be done?

01:32:02.310 --> 01:32:05.240
What must be done?

01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:10.290
Here in 1998, Nelson Mandela
addressed an audience of 25,000

01:32:10.290 --> 01:32:13.180
and spoke of our shared future.

01:32:13.180 --> 01:32:16.600
The greatest single challenge
facing our globalized world,

01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:22.610
he said, is to combat and
eradicate its disparities.

01:32:22.610 --> 01:32:26.340
Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, the first
female head of state in Africa,

01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:30.290
stood here 13 years later
and encouraged graduates

01:32:30.290 --> 01:32:35.170
to resist cynicism
and to be fearless.

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:39.920
Here on the terrible afternoon
of September 11, 2001,

01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.730
we gathered under
a cloudless sky

01:32:42.730 --> 01:32:47.340
to share our sadness, our
horror, and our disbelief.

01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:49.430
And here just three
years ago we marked

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:53.290
Harvard's 375th
anniversary dancing

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:57.530
in the mud of a
torrential downpour.

01:32:57.530 --> 01:33:01.320
Here, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
had celebrated Harvard's three

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:07.000
centuries of accomplishment
in a comparably soaking rain.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.470
Here, J. K. Rowling
encouraged graduates

01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:12.980
to think themselves into
other people's places.

01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:18.190
And Conan O'Brien told them
that every failure is freeing.

01:33:18.190 --> 01:33:20.360
Here, honorary degrees
have been presented

01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:24.160
to Carl Jung, and Jean
Piaget, and Ellsworth Kelly,

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.230
and Georgia O'Keeffe,
Helen Keller,

01:33:26.230 --> 01:33:32.080
and Martha Graham, Ravi Shankar,
and Leonard Bernstein, Joan

01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:35.960
Dideon, and Philip
Roth, Eric Kandel,

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:41.880
and Elizabeth Blackburn, Bill
Gates, and Tim Berners-Lee.

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.400
I remember feeling
awed by that history

01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:46.940
when I spoke here
at my installation

01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:50.160
as Harvard's 28th
president and when

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.810
I reflected on what
has always seemed to me

01:33:52.810 --> 01:33:57.900
the essence of a university,
that among society's

01:33:57.900 --> 01:34:03.650
institutions it is uniquely
accountable to the past

01:34:03.650 --> 01:34:06.520
and to the future.

01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:10.730
Our accountability to the
past is all around us.

01:34:10.730 --> 01:34:15.030
Behind me stands Memorial
Church, a monument

01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:17.730
to Harvardians who gave
their lives at the Somme,

01:34:17.730 --> 01:34:22.830
and [INAUDIBLE] and Verdun
during World War I. Dedicated

01:34:22.830 --> 01:34:27.000
on Armistice Day in
1932, it represents

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.620
Harvard's long tradition
of commitment to service.

01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:34.940
In front of me is
Widener Library,

01:34:34.940 --> 01:34:38.310
a gift from a
bereaved mother, named

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:43.430
in honor of her son Harry who
perished aboard the Titanic,

01:34:43.430 --> 01:34:46.090
a library built to
advance the learning

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:51.620
and discovery enabled by one
of the most diverse and broad

01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:54.490
collections in the world.

01:34:54.490 --> 01:34:57.770
Widener's 12 majestic
columns safeguard

01:34:57.770 --> 01:35:01.730
texts and manuscripts,
some centuries old,

01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:04.370
that are deployed
every day by scholars

01:35:04.370 --> 01:35:09.370
to help us interpret and
reinterpret the past.

01:35:09.370 --> 01:35:11.530
But this afternoon,
I would like to spend

01:35:11.530 --> 01:35:16.640
a few minutes considering our
accountability to the future,

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:22.040
because these obligations must
be our compass to steer by,

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:26.120
our common purpose, and
our shared commitment.

01:35:26.120 --> 01:35:32.200
What does Harvard-- what do
universities owe the future?

01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.660
First, we owe the world answers.

01:35:36.660 --> 01:35:41.300
Discovery is at the heart
of what universities do.

01:35:41.300 --> 01:35:44.240
Universities engage
faculty and students

01:35:44.240 --> 01:35:48.190
across a range of disciplines
in seeking solutions

01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:52.480
to problems that may have
seemed unsolvable, endeavoring

01:35:52.480 --> 01:35:56.870
to answer questions that
threaten to elude us.

01:35:56.870 --> 01:35:59.190
The scientific research
undertaken today

01:35:59.190 --> 01:36:02.910
at Harvard and tomorrow
by the students we educate

01:36:02.910 --> 01:36:07.870
has the capacity to improve
human lives in ways virtually

01:36:07.870 --> 01:36:11.450
unimaginable even
a generation ago.

01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:15.120
In this past year alone,
Harvard researchers

01:36:15.120 --> 01:36:18.810
have solved riddles related to
the treatment of Alzheimer's,

01:36:18.810 --> 01:36:22.700
the cost-effective production
of malaria vaccine,

01:36:22.700 --> 01:36:25.840
and the origins of the universe.

01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:28.030
Harvard researchers
have proposed answers

01:36:28.030 --> 01:36:31.400
to challenges as varied
as nuclear proliferation,

01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:36.270
American competitiveness, and
governance of the internet.

01:36:36.270 --> 01:36:40.510
We must continue to support
our answer seekers who

01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:45.110
work at the crossroads of the
theoretical and the applied,

01:36:45.110 --> 01:36:50.540
at the nexus of research, public
policy, and entrepreneurship.

01:36:50.540 --> 01:36:53.460
Together they will
shape our future

01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:57.390
and enhance our
understanding of the world.

01:36:57.390 --> 01:37:02.180
Second, we owe the
world questions.

01:37:02.180 --> 01:37:08.920
Just as questions yield answers,
answers yield questions.

01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:11.940
Human beings may long for
certainty, but as Oliver

01:37:11.940 --> 01:37:17.700
Wendell Holmes put it,
certainty generally is allusion,

01:37:17.700 --> 01:37:21.700
and repose is not
the destiny of man.

01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:24.320
Universities produce knowledge.

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:27.890
They must also produced doubt.

01:37:27.890 --> 01:37:31.510
The pursuit of
truth is restless.

01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:35.610
We search for answers not by
following prescribed paths

01:37:35.610 --> 01:37:38.090
but by finding the
right questions,

01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:41.020
by answering one question
with another question,

01:37:41.020 --> 01:37:45.110
by nurturing a state of mind
that is flexible and alert,

01:37:45.110 --> 01:37:48.490
dissatisfied and imaginative.

01:37:48.490 --> 01:37:52.590
It's what universities
are designed to do.

01:37:52.590 --> 01:37:56.610
In an essay in Harvard Magazine,
one of today's graduates,

01:37:56.610 --> 01:37:59.660
Cherone Dugan,
wrote about seeking

01:37:59.660 --> 01:38:04.040
what she called an
education of questions.

01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:08.660
I hope we have indeed
given her that.

01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:11.130
Questions are the
foundation for progress,

01:38:11.130 --> 01:38:13.310
for ensuring that
the world transcends

01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:16.620
where we are now,
what we know now.

01:38:16.620 --> 01:38:18.790
And questions are
also the foundation

01:38:18.790 --> 01:38:24.430
for a third obligation that we
as universities owe the future.

01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:27.810
We owe the future meaning.

01:38:27.810 --> 01:38:29.810
Universities must
nurture the ability

01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:33.140
to interpret, to make
critical judgments,

01:38:33.140 --> 01:38:36.700
to dare to ask the biggest
questions, the ones that

01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:40.480
reach well beyond the
immediate and the instrumental.

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.660
We must stimulate the
appetite for curiosity.

01:38:44.660 --> 01:38:48.330
We find many of these
questions in the humanities.

01:38:48.330 --> 01:38:49.700
What is good?

01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:51.400
What is just?

01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.920
How do we know what is true?

01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.870
But we find them in
the sciences, as well.

01:38:56.870 --> 01:39:00.580
Can there be any question more
profound, more fundamental,

01:39:00.580 --> 01:39:04.970
than to ask about the
origins of the universe?

01:39:04.970 --> 01:39:07.730
How did we get here?

01:39:07.730 --> 01:39:10.090
Questions like these
can be unsettling

01:39:10.090 --> 01:39:14.070
and they can make universities
unsettling places,

01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:16.090
but that, too, is
an essential part

01:39:16.090 --> 01:39:21.430
of what we owe the future-- the
promise to combat complacency,

01:39:21.430 --> 01:39:23.410
to challenge the
present in order

01:39:23.410 --> 01:39:28.530
to prepare for what is to come,
to shape the present in service

01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:32.730
of an uncertain and
yet impatient future.

01:39:32.730 --> 01:39:34.910
We owe the future answers.

01:39:34.910 --> 01:39:36.650
We owe the future questions.

01:39:36.650 --> 01:39:38.880
We owe the future meaning.

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:41.200
The Harvard Campaign
launched last September

01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.490
will help us fulfill these
obligations and pay our debt

01:39:44.490 --> 01:39:48.880
to the future, just as the
gifts of previous generations

01:39:48.880 --> 01:39:51.580
anchor us here today.

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:54.660
As today's ceremonies
so powerfully remind us,

01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:58.090
we also owe the future
the men and women

01:39:58.090 --> 01:40:01.440
who are prepared to ask
questions and seek answers

01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:04.770
and search for meaning
for decades to come.

01:40:04.770 --> 01:40:07.540
Today we send some
6,500 graduates

01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:11.260
into the world to be teachers
and lawyers, scientists

01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:15.440
and physicians, poets and
planners and public servants,

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.890
and as our speaker this
morning reminded us,

01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:21.480
to be in their own
ways revolutionaries,

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:24.640
ready to take on everything
from water scarcity

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.190
to virtual currency
to community policing.

01:40:28.190 --> 01:40:31.040
We must continue to
invest in financial aid

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:34.540
to attract and support
the talented students who

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:36.540
can build our future.

01:40:36.540 --> 01:40:39.630
And also, we must invest
in supporting the teaching

01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:41.590
and learning that
ensures the fullest

01:40:41.590 --> 01:40:46.190
development of their
capacities in a changing world.

01:40:46.190 --> 01:40:50.370
If we fulfill our
obligations, today's graduates

01:40:50.370 --> 01:40:55.710
will have found the education
of questions Cherone described,

01:40:55.710 --> 01:41:02.920
a place where, as she put it,
ceilings are made only of sky.

01:41:02.920 --> 01:41:03.870
But look around you.

01:41:03.870 --> 01:41:05.870
We're there.

01:41:05.870 --> 01:41:11.030
This place is a theater
without walls, without a roof,

01:41:11.030 --> 01:41:13.030
and without limits.

01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:17.910
It's a place where extraordinary
individuals have preceded us,

01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:22.010
a place that must encourage
our graduates of today

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:26.570
and all the years passed to
emulate those women and men,

01:41:26.570 --> 01:41:29.490
to look skyward and to soar.

01:41:29.490 --> 01:41:30.972
Thank you very much.

01:41:47.090 --> 01:41:49.160
Thank you, President Faust.

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:52.360
There is no question that
we are fortunate to have you

01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.140
as our leader.

01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:54.830
Thank you, Kate.

01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:59.590
To honor the contributions
of Radcliffe College and it's

01:41:59.590 --> 01:42:04.130
alumni and to mark its
historical significance

01:42:04.130 --> 01:42:08.510
for men and women alike,
please stand and join

01:42:08.510 --> 01:42:11.530
in singing Radcliffe's
alma mater,

01:42:11.530 --> 01:42:13.760
"Radcliffe, Now We
Rise to Greet Thee."

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:16.087
The words are in your program.

01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:52.720
This afternoon's
commencement speaker

01:43:52.720 --> 01:43:55.980
is known around the world.

01:43:55.980 --> 01:44:00.730
If you work in finance, you
are aware of what a Bloomberg

01:44:00.730 --> 01:44:05.510
Terminal is and the unique
color-coded keyboard that

01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:07.460
comes with it.

01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:11.500
If you live in or
near a city, you

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:16.250
probably follow mayoral politics
and have heard something

01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:19.970
about the former mayor
of New York City.

01:44:19.970 --> 01:44:23.410
And if you are here with an
interest in public health,

01:44:23.410 --> 01:44:27.950
the arts, the
environment, or education,

01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:31.450
then you know how his
philanthropic support

01:44:31.450 --> 01:44:34.900
is focused around impact.

01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.600
After growing up a little
over five miles from here

01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.900
in Medford, Michael
Bloomberg graduated

01:44:41.900 --> 01:44:46.300
from Johns Hopkins
in 1964 with a degree

01:44:46.300 --> 01:44:48.730
in electrical engineering.

01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:52.860
After college, he attended
Harvard Business School and in

01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:59.090
1966 was hired by a Wall
Street firm, Solomon Brothers,

01:44:59.090 --> 01:45:02.480
for an entry-level job.

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:07.700
He left in 1981 to found
Bloomberg LP, which

01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:11.380
he led for 20 years.

01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:15.840
In 2001, he ran for
mayor of New York

01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:21.240
and was elected two months
after the 9/11 tragedy.

01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:24.410
During his three
terms in office,

01:45:24.410 --> 01:45:30.400
he focused on public health,
combating crime, gun control,

01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:33.760
the environment, and
many other issues

01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:36.590
important to New Yorkers.

01:45:36.590 --> 01:45:40.160
Throughout his entire
career, Michael Bloomberg

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.853
has also been an
active philanthropist.

01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:48.280
As a philanthropist,
Bloomberg has

01:45:48.280 --> 01:45:51.140
been realistic
about how to tackle

01:45:51.140 --> 01:45:54.840
large problems around the world.

01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.700
In business, he has
shown that there

01:45:57.700 --> 01:46:01.160
are many ways to
make a difference.

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:04.070
As mayor, he
understood that he is

01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:08.520
responsible for
delivering results.

01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:13.800
There is nobody better qualified
to address our alumni today

01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:18.360
than Mr. Michael Bloomberg,
founder of Bloomberg LP,

01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:22.000
108th mayor of New York
City, and philanthropist.

01:46:35.257 --> 01:46:37.740
Thank you.

01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:38.750
Thank you, Katie.

01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:41.530
And thank you to President
Faust, and the Fellows

01:46:41.530 --> 01:46:44.810
of Harvard College,
the Board of Overseers,

01:46:44.810 --> 01:46:48.470
and all of the faculty,
alumni, and students

01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:52.090
who have welcomed
me back to campus.

01:46:52.090 --> 01:46:55.270
I am excited to be here,
not only to address

01:46:55.270 --> 01:46:59.170
the distinguished graduates and
alumni at Harvard University's

01:46:59.170 --> 01:47:03.770
363rd commencement,
but most importantly

01:47:03.770 --> 01:47:09.972
to stand in the exact spot
where Oprah stood last year.

01:47:09.972 --> 01:47:12.427
O-M-G.

01:47:15.380 --> 01:47:18.000
Let me begin with the
first order of business.

01:47:18.000 --> 01:47:21.970
Let's have a big round of
applause for the class of 2014.

01:47:21.970 --> 01:47:22.840
They've earned it.

01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:38.130
Now, excited as
these graduates are,

01:47:38.130 --> 01:47:40.490
they are probably
even more exhausted

01:47:40.490 --> 01:47:42.300
after the past few weeks.

01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:47.400
And parents, I am not
referring to their final exams.

01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.280
I'm talking about the Senior
Olympics, the Last Chance

01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:55.380
Dance, and the booze cruise--
I mean the midnight cruise.

01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:58.970
Anyways, this year has
been exciting on campus.

01:47:58.970 --> 01:48:02.060
Harvard beat Yale for
the seventh straight time

01:48:02.060 --> 01:48:02.560
in football.

01:48:08.210 --> 01:48:12.390
The men's basketball team went
to the second round of the NCAA

01:48:12.390 --> 01:48:14.420
tournament for the
second straight year.

01:48:17.650 --> 01:48:22.920
And the men's squash team won
the national championship.

01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:26.397
Who'd have thunk it?

01:48:26.397 --> 01:48:27.230
Who'd have thunk it?

01:48:27.230 --> 01:48:30.600
Harvard, an athletic powerhouse.

01:48:30.600 --> 01:48:33.870
Pretty soon, Drew, they're going
to be asking whether you have

01:48:33.870 --> 01:48:38.820
academics to go along with
your academic programs.

01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:40.660
Now, my personal
connection to Harvard

01:48:40.660 --> 01:48:44.380
began back in 1964
when I graduated

01:48:44.380 --> 01:48:47.430
from Johns Hopkins in
Baltimore and matriculated here

01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:49.080
at the B school.

01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:51.750
You're probably asking
yourself, or maybe whispering

01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:53.940
to the person next
to you, how did

01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:56.540
he ever get into
Harvard Business School,

01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:01.040
particularly since his stellar
academic record where he always

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:03.446
made the top half of
the class possible?

01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.820
I have no idea.

01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:10.090
The only people who were
more surprised than me

01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:12.550
were my professors.

01:49:12.550 --> 01:49:15.080
Anyways, here I am
back in Cambridge,

01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.580
and I've noticed
a few things have

01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:19.270
changed since I
was a student here.

01:49:19.270 --> 01:49:22.860
Elsie's, a sandwich spot I
used to love near the square,

01:49:22.860 --> 01:49:27.040
is now a burrito shop.

01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:29.850
The Wursthaus, which had
great beer and sausage,

01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:35.490
is now an artisanal
gastropub, whatever that is.

01:49:35.490 --> 01:49:37.750
And the old Holyoke
Center is now

01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:41.010
named the Smith Campus Center.

01:49:41.010 --> 01:49:43.450
Don't you just hate it
when alumni put their names

01:49:43.450 --> 01:49:46.390
all over everything?

01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:47.870
I was thinking
about this morning

01:49:47.870 --> 01:49:49.520
as I walked into
the Bloomberg Center

01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:53.930
on the Harvard Business School
campus across the river.

01:49:53.930 --> 01:49:56.530
But the good news
is, Harvard remains

01:49:56.530 --> 01:50:00.350
what it was when I first
arrived on campus 50 years ago,

01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:03.500
America's most
prestigious university.

01:50:03.500 --> 01:50:05.660
And like other
great universities,

01:50:05.660 --> 01:50:08.730
it lies at the heart of
the American experiment

01:50:08.730 --> 01:50:10.570
in democracy.

01:50:10.570 --> 01:50:13.770
Their purpose is not
only to advance knowledge

01:50:13.770 --> 01:50:17.580
but to advance the
ideals of our nation.

01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:19.380
Great universities
are places where

01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:23.160
people of all backgrounds,
holding all beliefs,

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:27.300
pursuing all questions, can
come to study and debate

01:50:27.300 --> 01:50:30.930
their ideas freely and openly.

01:50:30.930 --> 01:50:33.600
And today I'd like to talk
to you about how important it

01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:37.520
is for that freedom to exist
for everyone, no matter

01:50:37.520 --> 01:50:41.950
how strongly we may disagree
with another's viewpoint.

01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:44.990
Tolerance for other
people's ideas

01:50:44.990 --> 01:50:48.260
and the freedom to
express your own

01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:52.000
are inseparable values
at great universities.

01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.300
Joined together, they
form a sacred trust

01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:59.000
that holds the basis of
our democratic society.

01:50:59.000 --> 01:51:01.570
But let me tell you,
that trust is perpetually

01:51:01.570 --> 01:51:07.450
vulnerable to the tyrannical
tendencies of monarchs, mobs,

01:51:07.450 --> 01:51:09.230
and majorities.

01:51:09.230 --> 01:51:13.290
And lately we've seen those
tendencies manifest themselves

01:51:13.290 --> 01:51:18.360
too often, both on college
campuses and in our society.

01:51:18.360 --> 01:51:20.000
That's the bad news.

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:22.520
And unfortunately,
I think both Harvard

01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:26.820
and my own city, New York, have
been witnesses to this trend.

01:51:26.820 --> 01:51:28.890
First, for New York City.

01:51:28.890 --> 01:51:31.590
Several years ago,
as you may remember,

01:51:31.590 --> 01:51:34.530
some people tried to stop
the development of a mosque

01:51:34.530 --> 01:51:37.790
a few blocks from the
World Trade Center site.

01:51:37.790 --> 01:51:40.210
It was an emotional
issue, and polls

01:51:40.210 --> 01:51:42.560
showed that 2/3
of Americans were

01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:45.270
against a mosque
being built there.

01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:48.570
Even the Anti-Defamation
League, widely regarded

01:51:48.570 --> 01:51:52.210
as the country's most ardent
defender of religious freedom,

01:51:52.210 --> 01:51:55.370
declared its opposition
to the project.

01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:58.780
The opponents held rallies
and demonstrations.

01:51:58.780 --> 01:52:01.020
They denounced the
developers, and they

01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:05.140
demanded that city government
stop its construction.

01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:08.060
That was their right, and
we protected their right

01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:09.540
to protest.

01:52:09.540 --> 01:52:11.860
But they could not
have been more wrong,

01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:15.700
and we refused to cave
in to those demands.

01:52:15.700 --> 01:52:18.280
The idea that government
would single out

01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:22.760
a particular religion and
block its believers, and only

01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:25.530
its believers, from
building a house of worship

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:29.000
in a particular area is
diametrically opposed

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:32.860
to the moral principles that
gave rise to our great nation

01:52:32.860 --> 01:52:35.090
and the constitutional
protections that

01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:36.539
have sustained it.

01:52:48.150 --> 01:52:51.990
Our union of 50 states
rests on the union

01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:56.350
of two values,
freedom and tolerance.

01:52:56.350 --> 01:52:59.730
And it is that union of
values that the terrorists who

01:52:59.730 --> 01:53:07.240
attacked us on September 11,
2001 and on April 15, 2013

01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:09.160
found most threatening.

01:53:09.160 --> 01:53:12.770
To them, we were
a godless country.

01:53:12.770 --> 01:53:15.430
But in fact, there
is no country that

01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:18.680
protects the core of every
faith and philosophy known

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:22.070
to humankind, free will,
more than the United

01:53:22.070 --> 01:53:22.820
States of America.

01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:32.070
And that protection,
however, rests

01:53:32.070 --> 01:53:35.040
upon our constant vigilance.

01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:37.240
We like to think that the
principle of separation

01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:39.130
of church and state is settled.

01:53:39.130 --> 01:53:41.860
It is not, and it never will be.

01:53:41.860 --> 01:53:44.860
It's up to us to
guard it fiercely

01:53:44.860 --> 01:53:47.860
and to ensure that
equality under the law

01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:51.690
means equality under
the law for everyone.

01:53:51.690 --> 01:53:55.200
If you want the freedom
to worship as you wish,

01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.690
to speak as you wish, and
to marry whom you wish,

01:53:59.690 --> 01:54:06.030
you must tolerate my freedom to
do so or not to do so, as well.

01:54:06.030 --> 01:54:08.106
Now, what I do may offend you.

01:54:08.106 --> 01:54:12.280
You may find my actions
immoral or unjust,

01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:15.640
but attempting to restrict
my freedoms in ways

01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:20.590
that you would not restrict your
own leads only to injustice.

01:54:20.590 --> 01:54:24.780
We cannot deny others the rights
and privileges that we demand

01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:26.360
for ourselves.

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.830
And that is true
in cities, and it

01:54:28.830 --> 01:54:33.080
is no less true at universities
where the forces of repression

01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.270
appear to be stronger
now, I think,

01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:39.830
than they have been at
any time since the 1950s.

01:54:39.830 --> 01:54:44.108
When I was growing up, US
Senator-- yes, you can applaud.

01:54:48.930 --> 01:54:51.660
When I was growing up,
US Senator Joe McCarthy

01:54:51.660 --> 01:54:56.790
was asking, are you now
or have you ever been?

01:54:56.790 --> 01:54:59.830
He was attempting to
repress and criminalize

01:54:59.830 --> 01:55:04.040
those who sympathized with an
economic system that was even

01:55:04.040 --> 01:55:05.870
then failing.

01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:10.030
McCarthy's Red Scare
destroyed thousands of lives,

01:55:10.030 --> 01:55:12.370
but what was he so afraid of?

01:55:12.370 --> 01:55:16.050
An idea, in this case
communism, that he and others

01:55:16.050 --> 01:55:18.060
deemed dangerous?

01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:20.310
But he was right
about one thing.

01:55:20.310 --> 01:55:22.930
Ideas can be dangerous.

01:55:22.930 --> 01:55:25.120
They can change society.

01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:27.130
They can upend traditions.

01:55:27.130 --> 01:55:29.360
They can start revolutions.

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:32.250
And that's why throughout
history, those in authority

01:55:32.250 --> 01:55:34.880
have tried to repress
the ideas that

01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.770
threaten their power, their
religion, their ideology,

01:55:39.770 --> 01:55:42.350
or their reelection chances.

01:55:42.350 --> 01:55:45.790
This was true for
Socrates and Galileo.

01:55:45.790 --> 01:55:50.410
It was true for Nelson
Mandela and Vaclav Havel.

01:55:50.410 --> 01:55:53.780
And it has been true for
Ai Weiwei, Pussy Riot,

01:55:53.780 --> 01:55:57.420
and the kids who made the
"Happy" video in Iran.

01:55:57.420 --> 01:56:02.590
Repressing free expression
is a natural human weakness,

01:56:02.590 --> 01:56:06.240
and it is up to us to
fight it at every turn.

01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:10.480
Intolerance of ideas, whether
liberal or conservative,

01:56:10.480 --> 01:56:14.510
is antithetical to individual
rights and free societies.

01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:18.020
And it is no less antithetical
to great universities

01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:20.500
and first-rate scholarships.

01:56:20.500 --> 01:56:23.810
Now, there is an idea floating
around college campuses,

01:56:23.810 --> 01:56:26.240
including here at
Harvard, I think,

01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:29.790
that scholars should be funded
only if their work conforms

01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:33.000
to a particular view of justice.

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.220
There's a word for
that idea-- censorship.

01:56:36.220 --> 01:56:40.130
And it is just a modern
form of McCarthyism.

01:56:40.130 --> 01:56:41.900
Think about the irony.

01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:45.200
In the 1950s, the right
wing was attempting

01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:48.180
to repress left wing ideas.

01:56:48.180 --> 01:56:50.810
Today on many
college campuses, it

01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:54.240
is liberals trying to
repress conservative ideas,

01:56:54.240 --> 01:56:56.300
even as conservative
faculty members

01:56:56.300 --> 01:56:59.130
are at risk of becoming
an endangered species.

01:56:59.130 --> 01:57:02.650
And that is probably
nowhere more true

01:57:02.650 --> 01:57:05.280
than it is here
in the Ivy League.

01:57:05.280 --> 01:57:09.345
In the 2012 presidential race,
according to federal-- yes,

01:57:09.345 --> 01:57:09.845
thank you.

01:57:13.270 --> 01:57:17.740
In the 2012 presidential race,
according to Federal Election

01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:22.630
Commission data, 96% of
all campaign contributions

01:57:22.630 --> 01:57:27.390
from Ivy League faculty and
employees went to Barack Obama.

01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:27.890
96%.

01:57:31.320 --> 01:57:34.415
There was more disagreement
among the old Soviet Politburo

01:57:34.415 --> 01:57:37.990
than there was among
Ivy League donors.

01:57:37.990 --> 01:57:40.330
And that statistic should
give us some pause.

01:57:40.330 --> 01:57:42.320
And I say that as
someone who endorsed

01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.530
President Obama for reelection.

01:57:44.530 --> 01:57:46.360
Because let me
tell you something.

01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:50.610
Neither party has a monopoly
on truth or God on its side.

01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:00.750
When 96% of Ivy League
donors prefer one candidate

01:58:00.750 --> 01:58:03.910
to another, you really have to
wonder whether the students are

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:06.750
being exposed to the
diversity of views

01:58:06.750 --> 01:58:09.590
that a great university
should offer.

01:58:09.590 --> 01:58:13.820
Diversity of gender, ethnicity,
and orientation is important,

01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:17.560
but a university cannot be great
if it's faculty is politically

01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:19.070
homogeneous.

01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:25.310
In fact, the whole purpose
of-- in fact, the whole purpose

01:58:25.310 --> 01:58:28.260
of granting tenure
to professors is

01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.120
to ensure that they feel
free to conduct research

01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:33.930
on ideas that run
afoul of university

01:58:33.930 --> 01:58:36.870
politics and societal norms.

01:58:36.870 --> 01:58:39.540
When tenure was
created, it mostly

01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:44.860
protected liberals whose ideas
ran against conservative norms.

01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:47.400
Today, if tenure is
going to continue,

01:58:47.400 --> 01:58:49.370
it must also protect
conservatives

01:58:49.370 --> 01:58:52.490
whose ideas run up
against liberal norms.

01:58:52.490 --> 01:58:56.070
Otherwise, university
research and the professors

01:58:56.070 --> 01:58:58.660
who conduct it will
lose credibility.

01:58:58.660 --> 01:59:02.440
Great universities must not
become predictably partisan,

01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:05.750
and a liberal arts
education must not

01:59:05.750 --> 01:59:08.970
be an education in
the art of liberalism.

01:59:08.970 --> 01:59:12.870
The role of universities is
not to promote an ideology.

01:59:12.870 --> 01:59:17.110
It is to provide scholars and
students with a neutral forum

01:59:17.110 --> 01:59:19.930
for researching
and debating issues

01:59:19.930 --> 01:59:22.600
without tipping the
scales in one direction

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.380
or repressing unpopular views.

01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:28.600
Requiring scholars and
commencement speakers,

01:59:28.600 --> 01:59:32.520
for that matter, to conform
to certain political standards

01:59:32.520 --> 01:59:35.326
undermines the whole
purpose of a university.

01:59:46.330 --> 01:59:49.610
This spring it has been serving
to see a number of college

01:59:49.610 --> 01:59:53.300
commencement speakers withdrawal
or have their invitations

01:59:53.300 --> 01:59:56.390
rescinded after
protests from students

01:59:56.390 --> 01:59:59.640
and, to me, shockingly
from senior faculty

01:59:59.640 --> 02:00:02.250
and administrators who
should know better.

02:00:02.250 --> 02:00:06.860
It happened at Brandeis,
Haverford, Rutgers, and Smith.

02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:09.780
And last year, it happened at
Swarthmore and Johns Hopkins,

02:00:09.780 --> 02:00:11.800
I'm sorry to say.

02:00:11.800 --> 02:00:15.710
In each of these cases,
liberals silenced a voice,

02:00:15.710 --> 02:00:19.010
and they denied an honorary
degree to individuals

02:00:19.010 --> 02:00:22.120
that they deemed
politically objectionable.

02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:25.024
This is an outrage, and we
must not let it continue.

02:00:32.780 --> 02:00:36.950
If the university thinks twice
before inviting a commencement

02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:39.790
speaker because of
his or her politics,

02:00:39.790 --> 02:00:44.660
censorship and conformity,
the mortal enemies of freedom,

02:00:44.660 --> 02:00:45.730
win out.

02:00:45.730 --> 02:00:48.580
And sadly, it's not
just commencement season

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:51.180
when speakers are censored.

02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:53.750
Last fall when I was
still in City Hall,

02:00:53.750 --> 02:00:55.490
our police commissioner
was invited

02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:59.740
to deliver a lecture at
another Ivy League institution,

02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:02.970
but he was unable to do so
because students shouted him

02:01:02.970 --> 02:01:04.120
down.

02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:06.970
Isn't the purpose
of the university

02:01:06.970 --> 02:01:10.100
to stir discussion,
not silence it?

02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:12.410
What were the students
afraid of hearing?

02:01:12.410 --> 02:01:14.580
And why did
administrators not step in

02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:17.880
to prevent the mob
from silencing speech?

02:01:17.880 --> 02:01:21.960
And did anyone consider that
it is morally and pedagogically

02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.120
wrong to deprive other students
the chance to hear the speech?

02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:28.680
Now, I'm sure all
of today's graduates

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:31.860
have read John Stuart
Mill's On Liberty,

02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:35.340
but just let me read a
short passage from it.

02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:39.580
Quote, "the particular evil
of silencing the expression

02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.510
of an opinion is that it
is robbing the human race,

02:01:43.510 --> 02:01:47.110
posterity, as well as the
existing generation, those

02:01:47.110 --> 02:01:49.140
who dissent from
the opinion still

02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:51.500
more than those who hold it."

02:01:51.500 --> 02:01:54.270
He continued, "if
the opinion is right,

02:01:54.270 --> 02:01:56.130
they are deprived
of the opportunity

02:01:56.130 --> 02:01:59.020
of exchanging error for truth.

02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:01.620
If wrong, they lose
what is almost as

02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:04.900
great a benefit, the clear
perception and livelier

02:02:04.900 --> 02:02:09.710
impression of truth produced
by its collision with error."

02:02:09.710 --> 02:02:11.410
Now, Mill would
have been horrified

02:02:11.410 --> 02:02:13.410
to learn of university
students silencing

02:02:13.410 --> 02:02:15.330
the opinions of others.

02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:18.340
He would have been even more
horrified that faculty members

02:02:18.340 --> 02:02:21.020
were often part of the
commencement censorship

02:02:21.020 --> 02:02:22.440
campaigns.

02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:25.890
For tenured professors,
to silence speakers

02:02:25.890 --> 02:02:28.220
whose views they
disagree with is really

02:02:28.220 --> 02:02:31.880
the height of hypocrisy,
especially when those protests

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:34.200
happen in the
Northeast, the bastion

02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:36.290
of self-professed
liberal tolerance.

02:02:43.565 --> 02:02:47.030
Now, I'm glad to say
that Harvard has not

02:02:47.030 --> 02:02:52.870
caved into these commencement
censorship challenges.

02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:56.270
If it had, Colorado State
Senator Michael Johnston

02:02:56.270 --> 02:02:58.750
would not have had the chance
to address the Education

02:02:58.750 --> 02:03:00.300
School yesterday.

02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:02.580
Some students called
on the administration

02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:04.990
to rescind the
invitation to Johnston

02:03:04.990 --> 02:03:08.560
because they opposed some
of his education policies,

02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:12.190
but to their great credit,
President Faust and Dean Ryan

02:03:12.190 --> 02:03:13.520
stood firm.

02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:15.460
And as Dean Ryan
wrote to the students,

02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:18.800
quote, "I have encountered
many people of good faith

02:03:18.800 --> 02:03:23.230
who share my basic goals but
disagree with my views when

02:03:23.230 --> 02:03:26.830
it comes to the question of
how best to improve education.

02:03:26.830 --> 02:03:31.770
In my view, those differences
should be explored, debated,

02:03:31.770 --> 02:03:36.040
challenged, and questioned, but
they should also be respected

02:03:36.040 --> 02:03:38.100
and indeed celebrated."

02:03:38.100 --> 02:03:39.970
He could not have
been more correct.

02:03:39.970 --> 02:03:42.630
He could not have provided
a more valuable final lesson

02:03:42.630 --> 02:03:53.840
to the class of 2014.

02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:56.160
As a former chairman
at Johns Hopkins,

02:03:56.160 --> 02:03:59.620
I strongly believe that a
university's obligation is not

02:03:59.620 --> 02:04:03.210
to teach students what to
think but to teach students

02:04:03.210 --> 02:04:04.850
how to think.

02:04:04.850 --> 02:04:07.660
And that requires listening
to the other side,

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:10.560
weighing arguments
without prejudicing them,

02:04:10.560 --> 02:04:12.925
and determining whether the
other side might actually

02:04:12.925 --> 02:04:15.490
have made some fair points.

02:04:15.490 --> 02:04:17.804
If the faculty fails
to do this, then it

02:04:17.804 --> 02:04:19.595
is the responsibility
of the administration

02:04:19.595 --> 02:04:23.170
and the governing body to step
in and make it a priority.

02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:26.780
If they do not-- if students
graduate with ears and minds

02:04:26.780 --> 02:04:29.140
closed, the
university has failed

02:04:29.140 --> 02:04:32.030
both the students and society.

02:04:32.030 --> 02:04:34.060
And if you want to
know where that leads,

02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:37.470
look no further
than Washington DC.

02:04:37.470 --> 02:04:42.130
Down in Washington, every major
question facing our country,

02:04:42.130 --> 02:04:46.160
involving our security, our
economy, our environment,

02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.110
and our health, is decided.

02:04:48.110 --> 02:04:50.560
Yet the two parties
decide those questions

02:04:50.560 --> 02:04:53.670
not by engaging with one
another but by trying

02:04:53.670 --> 02:04:57.140
to shout each other down
and by trying to repress

02:04:57.140 --> 02:05:01.550
and undermine the research
the counters their ideology.

02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:04.370
The more our universities
emulate that model,

02:05:04.370 --> 02:05:06.980
the worse off we
will be as a society.

02:05:06.980 --> 02:05:09.260
And let me give
you a few examples.

02:05:09.260 --> 02:05:11.820
For a decade, Congress
has barred the Centers

02:05:11.820 --> 02:05:13.560
for Disease Control
from conducting

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:15.470
studies of gun violence.

02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:18.740
And recently Congress also
placed that prohibition

02:05:18.740 --> 02:05:21.400
on the National
Institute of Health.

02:05:21.400 --> 02:05:25.260
You have to ask yourself,
what are they afraid of?

02:05:25.260 --> 02:05:28.630
This year the Senate has delayed
a vote on President Obama's

02:05:28.630 --> 02:05:33.330
nominee for Surgeon General,
Dr. Vivek Murthy, a Harvard

02:05:33.330 --> 02:05:36.120
physician, because
he had the audacity

02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:38.560
to say that gun violence
is a public health

02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:40.650
crisis that should be tackled.

02:05:40.650 --> 02:05:41.800
Th gall of him.

02:05:50.958 --> 02:05:52.720
Let's get serious.

02:05:52.720 --> 02:05:57.660
When 86 Americans are killed
with guns every single day

02:05:57.660 --> 02:06:01.320
and shootings regularly occur
at our schools and universities,

02:06:01.320 --> 02:06:04.280
including last week's
tragedy at Santa Barbara,

02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.700
it would be almost
medical malpractice

02:06:06.700 --> 02:06:09.010
to say anything else.

02:06:09.010 --> 02:06:13.370
But in politics, as it is on
far too many college campuses,

02:06:13.370 --> 02:06:15.050
people don't listen
to facts that

02:06:15.050 --> 02:06:17.190
run counter to their ideology.

02:06:17.190 --> 02:06:18.430
They fear them.

02:06:18.430 --> 02:06:20.570
And nothing is more
frightening to them

02:06:20.570 --> 02:06:23.060
than scientific evidence.

02:06:23.060 --> 02:06:26.030
Earlier this year, the
state of South Carolina

02:06:26.030 --> 02:06:29.770
adopted new science standards
for its public schools,

02:06:29.770 --> 02:06:31.860
but the state
legislature blocked

02:06:31.860 --> 02:06:34.940
any mention of
natural selection.

02:06:34.940 --> 02:06:37.840
That is like teaching
economics without mentioning

02:06:37.840 --> 02:06:40.150
supply and demand.

02:06:40.150 --> 02:06:43.710
Once again, you have to ask,
what are they afraid of?

02:06:43.710 --> 02:06:45.880
And the answer, of
course, is obvious.

02:06:45.880 --> 02:06:47.850
Just as members of
Congress fear data

02:06:47.850 --> 02:06:50.860
that undermines their
ideological beliefs,

02:06:50.860 --> 02:06:53.940
these state legislators
feared scientific evidence

02:06:53.940 --> 02:06:56.640
that undermines their
religious beliefs.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:59.610
And if you want proof
of that, consider this.

02:06:59.610 --> 02:07:02.450
An eight-year-old
girl in South Carolina

02:07:02.450 --> 02:07:05.280
wrote to members of
the state legislature

02:07:05.280 --> 02:07:09.280
urging them to make the woolly
mammoth the official state

02:07:09.280 --> 02:07:10.830
fossil.

02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:13.800
Legislators thought
it was a great idea,

02:07:13.800 --> 02:07:16.830
because a woolly mammal fossil
was found in the state way

02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:19.870
back in 1725.

02:07:19.870 --> 02:07:21.810
But the state
Senate passed a bill

02:07:21.810 --> 02:07:24.410
defining the woolly
mammoth as having been,

02:07:24.410 --> 02:07:28.480
quote, "created on the sixth day
with the beasts of the field,"

02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.840
unquote.

02:07:29.840 --> 02:07:32.530
You can't make this stuff up.

02:07:32.530 --> 02:07:36.390
Here in 21st century
America, the wall

02:07:36.390 --> 02:07:39.460
between church and state
remains under attack,

02:07:39.460 --> 02:07:41.900
but it's up to all of us
to man the barricades.

02:07:51.150 --> 02:07:53.170
Unfortunately, the
same elected officials

02:07:53.170 --> 02:07:56.160
who put ideology and religion
over data and science

02:07:56.160 --> 02:07:58.960
when it comes to guns
and evolution, often

02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:02.180
are the most unwilling to accept
the scientific data on climate

02:08:02.180 --> 02:08:03.280
change.

02:08:03.280 --> 02:08:04.620
Now, don't get me wrong.

02:08:04.620 --> 02:08:07.376
Scientific skepticism
is healthy,

02:08:07.376 --> 02:08:08.750
but there's a
world of difference

02:08:08.750 --> 02:08:11.340
between scientific
skepticism that seeks out

02:08:11.340 --> 02:08:16.390
more evidence and ideological
stubbornness that shuts it out.

02:08:16.390 --> 02:08:18.980
Given the general attitude
of many elected officials

02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:22.020
toward science, it's no wonder
the federal government has

02:08:22.020 --> 02:08:24.700
abdicated its
responsibility to invest

02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:27.080
in scientific
research, much of which

02:08:27.080 --> 02:08:29.520
occurs at our universities.

02:08:29.520 --> 02:08:32.050
Today federal spending on
research and development

02:08:32.050 --> 02:08:34.970
as a percentage of
GNP is lower than it

02:08:34.970 --> 02:08:37.590
has been in more
than 50 years, which

02:08:37.590 --> 02:08:40.010
is allowing the rest of the
world to catch up and even

02:08:40.010 --> 02:08:42.860
surpass the US in
scientific research.

02:08:42.860 --> 02:08:45.280
The federal government
is flunking science,

02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:47.900
just as many state
governments are.

02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:49.610
But we must not
become a country that

02:08:49.610 --> 02:08:53.600
turns its back on
science or on each other.

02:08:53.600 --> 02:08:56.250
Now, I get back to
the class of 2014.

02:08:56.250 --> 02:08:59.130
You graduates must
help lead the way.

02:08:59.130 --> 02:09:03.200
On every issue, we must follow
the evidence where it leads

02:09:03.200 --> 02:09:05.445
and listen to people
where they are.

02:09:08.480 --> 02:09:11.950
If we do that, there is no
problem we cannot solve,

02:09:11.950 --> 02:09:16.820
no gridlock we cannot break,
no compromise we cannot broker.

02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:21.500
The more we exchange or embrace
a free exchange of ideas,

02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:24.290
and the more we accept
that political diversity,

02:09:24.290 --> 02:09:28.410
the healthy we are, the
stronger our society will be.

02:09:28.410 --> 02:09:31.110
Now, I know this has not been
a traditional commencement

02:09:31.110 --> 02:09:32.340
speech.

02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:35.920
And in fact, it may keep me from
passing a dissertation defense

02:09:35.920 --> 02:09:40.700
in the humanities department,
but there is no easy time

02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:42.820
to say hard things.

02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.950
Graduates, throughout
your lives,

02:09:44.950 --> 02:09:48.180
do not be afraid of saying
what you believe is right,

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:50.960
no matter how
unpopular it may be,

02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:55.080
especially when it comes to
defending the rights of others.

02:09:55.080 --> 02:09:58.180
Stand up for the rights of
others, and in some ways

02:09:58.180 --> 02:10:00.095
it's even more important
than standing up

02:10:00.095 --> 02:10:02.450
for your own
rights, because when

02:10:02.450 --> 02:10:05.850
people seek to repress
freedom for some

02:10:05.850 --> 02:10:08.470
and you may remain
silent, you are

02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:14.390
complicit in that repression and
you may well become its victim.

02:10:14.390 --> 02:10:16.110
Do not be complicit.

02:10:16.110 --> 02:10:17.900
Do not follow the crowd.

02:10:17.900 --> 02:10:19.593
Speak up and fight back.

02:10:19.593 --> 02:10:21.540
You will take your lumps.

02:10:21.540 --> 02:10:23.170
I can assure you of that.

02:10:23.170 --> 02:10:25.910
You will lose some friends
and make some enemies.

02:10:25.910 --> 02:10:28.410
I can assure you of that, too.

02:10:28.410 --> 02:10:31.530
But the arc of history
will be on your side,

02:10:31.530 --> 02:10:34.290
and our nation will
be stronger for it.

02:10:34.290 --> 02:10:37.950
Now, all of you graduates have
earned today's celebration.

02:10:37.950 --> 02:10:41.440
You have a lot to be proud
of, a lot to be grateful for.

02:10:41.440 --> 02:10:44.760
So tonight, as you leave
this great university behind,

02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.565
have one last scorpion
bowl at the Kong.

02:10:47.565 --> 02:10:49.600
On second thought, don't.

02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:52.540
And tomorrow get
back to work making

02:10:52.540 --> 02:10:57.080
our country and our world freer
forever, freer for everyone.

02:10:57.080 --> 02:10:58.100
God bless and good luck.

02:11:41.370 --> 02:11:44.230
Thank you, Mr.
Bloomberg, for delivering

02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:48.460
such thoughtful remarks
to our community.

02:11:48.460 --> 02:11:53.920
As we prepare to close
these afternoon exercises,

02:11:53.920 --> 02:11:57.690
please stand once again
and join me now as we

02:11:57.690 --> 02:12:01.290
sing our alma mater,
"Fair Harvard."

02:12:01.290 --> 02:12:03.175
The words are in your program.

02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:46.620
On behalf of the Harvard
Alumni Association,

02:14:46.620 --> 02:14:53.090
let me once again welcome and
congratulate the class of 2014.

02:14:53.090 --> 02:14:58.620
You join one of the world's most
respected alumni communities,

02:14:58.620 --> 02:15:02.080
and we welcome you.

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:10.890
I now hereby declare the 2014
meeting of the Harvard Alumni

02:15:10.890 --> 02:15:15.420
Association adjourned,
to reconvene

02:15:15.420 --> 02:15:21.430
same time, same
place, same weather,

02:15:21.430 --> 02:15:26.704
on the 28th of May, 2015.

02:15:26.704 --> 02:15:28.195
Thank you for coming.

02:15:44.099 --> 02:15:48.816
And here we are at the
close of the 145th meeting

02:15:48.816 --> 02:15:52.740
of the Harvard Alumni
Association in conclusion

02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:54.076
to Harvard's 363rd commencement.

02:15:56.860 --> 02:16:03.418
We heard former mayor of New
York City Michael Bloomberg

02:16:03.418 --> 02:16:10.980
charge the class of 2014 to
follow evidence where it leads.

02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:13.670
It was an appeal for the
preservation of freedom

02:16:13.670 --> 02:16:17.745
of expression, not only
on college campuses

02:16:17.745 --> 02:16:21.885
but in cities and in towns
throughout our democracy.

02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:27.850
Mayor Bloomberg said that
freedom of expression

02:16:27.850 --> 02:16:31.440
and tolerance are the
hallmarks of a democracy

02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:34.950
and that too often
on college campuses

02:16:34.950 --> 02:16:38.660
liberals were repressing
conservative ideas

02:16:38.660 --> 02:16:43.270
and not allowing
expression for those ideas.

02:16:43.270 --> 02:16:47.080
He's concerned that today
with liberals repressing

02:16:47.080 --> 02:16:49.660
conservatives similar
to the McCarthy era

02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:53.040
when right wings were
repressing liberals.

02:16:53.040 --> 02:16:55.469
He said it's the responsibility
of the university

02:16:55.469 --> 02:17:00.100
to teach students how to think,
to listen to the other side,

02:17:00.100 --> 02:17:02.871
and to be able to discuss,
debate, and learn.

02:17:05.580 --> 02:17:08.219
This was the charge
of Michael Bloomberg

02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:12.309
to the Harvard class of 2014.

02:17:12.309 --> 02:17:14.007
Rennie.

02:17:14.007 --> 02:17:17.680
Our president first
noted the buildings

02:17:17.680 --> 02:17:21.162
around the theater,
which contribute

02:17:21.162 --> 02:17:23.780
to the support of our students.

02:17:23.780 --> 02:17:25.889
She then outlined
the obligations

02:17:25.889 --> 02:17:28.850
which Harvard shared purposes.

02:17:28.850 --> 02:17:31.363
Our research efforts, she noted.

02:17:31.363 --> 02:17:35.862
We owe the world our research
efforts and entrepreneurship.

02:17:35.862 --> 02:17:39.580
We owe the world to produce
the knowledge and education

02:17:39.580 --> 02:17:40.927
of question.

02:17:40.927 --> 02:17:43.619
And we owe the world to
create critical questions

02:17:43.619 --> 02:17:46.320
whose answers will
shape the future.

02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.495
And finally, we owe the
future men and women

02:17:49.495 --> 02:17:51.980
to be teachers and
public servants,

02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:54.340
ready to take on
today's problems

02:17:54.340 --> 02:17:58.780
and continue to invest
in them in the future.

02:17:58.780 --> 02:18:02.420
Thank you for joining us
for the afternoon exercises

02:18:02.420 --> 02:18:05.840
of Harvard's 363th commencement.

02:18:05.840 --> 02:18:08.760
And I will conclude
with the "Villanelle

02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:13.629
for an Anniversary," written
for Harvard's 350th celebration

02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:16.730
in 1986 by Seamus Heaney.

02:18:16.730 --> 02:18:21.860
He entitled the Villanelle
"John Harvard Walks the Yard."

02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:23.400
"A spirit moved.

02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:25.709
John Harvard walked the yard.

02:18:25.709 --> 02:18:30.495
The atom lay unsplit, the west
unwon, the books stood opened

02:18:30.495 --> 02:18:33.020
and the gates unbarred.

02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.059
The maps dreamt
on like moondust.

02:18:36.059 --> 02:18:37.530
Nothing stirred.

02:18:37.530 --> 02:18:40.500
The future was a
verb in hibernation.

02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:41.850
A spirit moved.

02:18:41.850 --> 02:18:44.139
John Harvard walked the yard.

02:18:44.139 --> 02:18:47.940
Before the classic style,
before the clapboard,

02:18:47.940 --> 02:18:51.700
all through the small hours of
an origin, the books stood open

02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:54.090
and the gate unbarred.

02:18:54.090 --> 02:18:57.070
Night passage of
a migratory bird.

02:18:57.070 --> 02:18:58.480
Wingflap.

02:18:58.480 --> 02:18:59.950
Gownflap.

02:18:59.950 --> 02:19:02.540
Like a homing pigeon,
a spirit moved.

02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:05.030
John Harvard walked the yard.

02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:12.540
Was that his soul, look, sped
to its reward by grace or works?

02:19:12.540 --> 02:19:13.719
A shooting star?

02:19:13.719 --> 02:19:14.760
An omen?

02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:18.090
The books stood open
and the gate unbarred.

02:19:18.090 --> 02:19:22.059
Begin again where frosts
and tests were hard.

02:19:22.059 --> 02:19:23.920
Find yourself or founder.

02:19:23.920 --> 02:19:26.480
Here, imagine, a spirit moves.

02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:28.700
John Harvard walked the yard.

02:19:28.700 --> 02:19:32.590
The books stand open
and the gates unbarred."

02:19:32.590 --> 02:19:34.620
Thank you so much,
and we look forward

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:41.370
to seeing you on May 28,
2015 for the 146th meeting

02:19:41.370 --> 02:19:43.260
of the Harvard
Alumni Association

02:19:43.260 --> 02:19:46.120
as part of Harvard's
364th commencement.
