1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:05,730
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich, Radiolab, the podcast. And this,

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:08,210
I actually brought a list.
Okay, let, what? Let's,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,670
why don't you share with me
your list? Where is this thing?

4
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:15,690
This is Andrew [inaudible]. He's a writer
and editor at The New Yorker magazine.

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,960
Oh, I might've gotten lost.
Occasionally pops onto our show.

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:22,440
Maybe you were mugged. Maybe a here it is.

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,660
And he recently got obsessed with a m
it's a list of measurements. Base units.

8
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:32,310
They're called theirs, their SEI
base units. The system international,

9
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,110
you know, so let me do it this way. Um,

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,840
have you ever wondered
how long an inch is dumb?

11
00:00:38,841 --> 00:00:42,200
Exactly. How long it's stuff. I
know I just look at a ruler. Well,

12
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:43,880
but how do you know that
your ruler and my ruler,

13
00:00:43,881 --> 00:00:46,850
do I have the same amount of inch
base or that someone in China,

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,010
they're inches are inches, your inches,
my edge. And really thought about it,

15
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:55,930
but I w I'm just assumed that there's
like a master inch somewhere be on too.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,460
I say it in French for reason and
which will feel it in a moment.

17
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:00,950
That is what was on this list
that Andrew was looking at.

18
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:05,980
It's a list of standard
measures for everything we
have around how big something

19
00:01:06,321 --> 00:01:09,830
is, how far something is, how hot
something is. It's all on this list. Okay.

20
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:15,060
So when you go down the list of
the systemic Internacional d units,

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:17,000
here's what you get. A meter.

22
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:22,680
A meter is a fraction of a second of the
distance traveled by light in a vacuum.

23
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,580
Okay.

24
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,580
A second is how much radiation
corresponds to the transition between two

25
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,540
hyperfine levels of the ground.
State of the cesium one 33 atom.

26
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,400
That's the definition of a second.

27
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,180
How many times does that particular
Adam Juggle? Yeah. Wow. Uh,

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,220
an ampere which measures electric current.
You know, amp is a constant current,

29
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:48,030
which if maintained in two
straight parallel conductors
of infinite length would

30
00:01:48,031 --> 00:01:49,680
produce between these conductors.

31
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,160
A force equal to two times 10 to the
negative seventh newtons per meter of

32
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:55,410
length. I have no idea what
that it's g, that's the thing.

33
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:58,830
If you look at the actual definitions,
any of these things am meter second,

34
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,843
whatever you go. Yeah.

35
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,170
[inaudible]

36
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,170
there is one standard on the list
that is unique for its simplicity.

37
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,130
The definition of the standard unit of
measurement that is a kilogram is no man,

38
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,610
no numbers. It is a thing,

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:20,920
a particular thing, a plum sized thing.

40
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,700
It is the only thing we
use to measure things.

41
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:30,870
It's the last one standing. The
only physical standard laugh.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,050
Why is it the last and why
there is it what, wait what?

43
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,290
Let me just take you back to
the beginning of the story.

44
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,010
Like I must admit that I expected this
story to be a lot more boring than I

45
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,710
found. It's like an
epic story. It's really,

46
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,980
that is Latif Nasser Science's story in
regular on our show and he says if you

47
00:02:50,981 --> 00:02:54,580
go all the way back to the very
first farmers back in Mesopotamia,

48
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:58,660
all of the earliest measurements were
super intuitive and he says a lot of them

49
00:02:58,661 --> 00:03:00,250
came. The body as

50
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:04,420
in that bunny is coming close
to the net. How close dad?

51
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:07,840
Two hands. But it's not just like, well
cause we think of like hands and feet,

52
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:08,351
but it was also,

53
00:03:08,351 --> 00:03:12,460
there are so many other kinds of
measurements like you would say, oh,

54
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,590
something is as far as you know,

55
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:19,591
my voice can carry or that something is
as far as I can see sitting on the top

56
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:24,850
of a camel or something is as
far as I can throw a stone.

57
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,100
So that would mean like say, okay,

58
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:35,101
I'm going to build a farm here and I'm
going to do it three throw rocks across.

59
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,420
Yeah. Yeah. The way I read
about it was like travelers,

60
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:42,060
like if you're a Saharan
traveler, you know, and you're,

61
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,820
you need to know where
the next watering hole is.

62
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:49,480
That's kind of a life and
death, uh, measurement. They
would say it's, you know,

63
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,750
three throw rocks away or
it's 10 throw rocks away.

64
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:52,011
But,

65
00:03:52,011 --> 00:03:55,670
but you know that there might be some
built in uncertainty there because if you

66
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:59,870
ask Achilles, yeah, it could be to
throw rocks away, but he asked me,

67
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:00,980
it would be like 78

68
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:05,060
you have nailed exactly the problem
with the throw a rock a system.

69
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,790
And these problems kind of came up

70
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,310
do ahead in the 17 hundreds,
it's the eve of the,

71
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,950
of the French revolution in
a little town called Paris.

72
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,050
It's a pretty cosmopolitan place,

73
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,390
which means that people are coming from
different places and they all have their

74
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:19,040
own measures,

75
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:23,900
approximately 250,000 different
units of measurement in regular use,

76
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:28,310
150,000. Every commodity has its own
measures. So you have grain, wine, oil,

77
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:31,430
salt, Hay for wood,
fabric, ev, everything.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,340
And it's extraordinarily confusing.

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,460
Not to mention it's
extraordinarily bad for trade.

80
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:42,420
So if I came to you and I say,
Miss Your, I have video of cloth,

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,980
you would say, how much cloth do you
got? And I'd say, I have two. Yeah.

82
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,980
And you say, what's the yard? I said,
[inaudible] these match America. I said,

83
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,550
no, no, he's this match. No, no.
It's this match and this match.

84
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,620
And then you can see the frustrating.

85
00:04:58,621 --> 00:05:01,080
It was frustrating and
making matters worse.

86
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,280
1780s, there was a famine.

87
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,310
So there was a shortage of grain and
people were hungry and people were angry,

88
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,470
which I am going to uh, call. Uh,
they were hangry, they were hangry,

89
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,620
they were very hangry to
the bakers at the time.

90
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,720
They knew that if they
raised the price of bread,

91
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,820
like an angry mob would
basically come and kill them.

92
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,470
But they also knew that
with no absolute standard,

93
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:28,560
there was no way to be sure that what you
were getting is what you were getting.

94
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:33,470
And so what they started doing was they
started just lightening their bread

95
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:37,150
loaves by just a little.
So as the famine got worse,

96
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:41,350
people would be waiting in longer and
longer lines to pay the same amount of

97
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:44,410
money for smaller and smaller loaves.

98
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,930
So they were getting angrier and angrier.

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,100
And so one of the things that people are
like crying out for is that they want

100
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,960
standardized weights and measures.

101
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:57,230
If I go to the bakery and I buy a loaf
of bread, I want a whole loaf of bread,

102
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:01,090
right? Don't short me on this.
This is serious. Well, you,

103
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,300
you know what happens next?

104
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,620
[inaudible]

105
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:07,360
best deal is stormed. And uh,

106
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,530
the king is under house
arrest and then [inaudible]

107
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,720
under the guillotine and as soon as the
revolutionary government takes over,

108
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,780
they said, all right, okay, this
is one of our first priorities.

109
00:06:17,781 --> 00:06:20,120
We are going to make a new standard,

110
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,050
but not based on something arbitrary
like a king. This is the enlightenment.

111
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:28,640
Why don't we draw on some kind
of totally different authority,

112
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:33,220
the authority of nature,
of nature of nature.

113
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:38,530
So long story short, they took
the circumference of the earth.

114
00:06:38,531 --> 00:06:41,200
They took a quarter of that
circumference, divided that by 10 million,

115
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:44,440
and they got the meter, the meter,
they then divided by 10 cube.

116
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,930
Dick filled the cube with water,
took the mass of the water,

117
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,960
minted the cylinder of metal
with that mass. And Voila,

118
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,000
they created the world's first kilogram.

119
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:58,010
The idea of this was if we make this
thing that is so beautiful and perfect and

120
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,720
everybody can see it that way,
then not only will France use it,

121
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,880
but the whole world will use it.

122
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,440
Then goods and ideas can be exchanged
everywhere by all people and it will be a

123
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,230
beautiful, glorious [inaudible]. Exactly.

124
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:20,470
They wanted something that
would be eternal and unchanging
for everybody for all

125
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:23,444
time.

126
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,710
So now I guess you want
to see it? Yeah. Okay.

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,040
Okay, so it's in here.

128
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,600
We ended up visiting the National
Institute of Standards and technology in

129
00:07:33,601 --> 00:07:35,460
Maryland, and this is
where we'll be going in,

130
00:07:35,461 --> 00:07:38,910
but we're going to go with this guy,
Patrick Abbott physicist was our guide.

131
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:43,710
They took us three stories down into the
Babbitt rocks of the state of Maryland

132
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:47,190
because they want things down
here to be totally still.

133
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,690
We've just gone through one double
door and here comes another double

134
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:53,520
[inaudible].

135
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,990
Then we stepped into this vault
of the room and narrowed was,

136
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:02,200
what we're looking at then is a glass
jar with a little handle on top and then

137
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:07,910
inside that is a another glass jar with
a little handle on top and inside that

138
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,820
is is the thing, the thing,

139
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,900
it's kind of gorgeous, really.

140
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:18,580
The shiniest little soon.

141
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:23,700
Do you ever seen very small and it
looks very clean, doesn't it too?

142
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,040
Yeah.

143
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,810
It's almost hard to tell where the like
brushing doll glass jar stops because

144
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:32,560
it's so reflective. That's might be crazy
question, but can we hold a kilogram?

145
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,300
That's our producer Lynn Levy. No,

146
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,830
I'm just curious to
know what it feels like.

147
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,300
We've been talking about it so much.

148
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,720
They are very careful with the kilogram
and this isn't even really the real one.

149
00:08:44,721 --> 00:08:47,810
The original of the original,
of the original, of the original

150
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,820
Gong cod as they call it,
lives in a basement in France.

151
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,850
You can't get anywhere near that
one. I could. No, you couldn't.

152
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:55,980
I get all Tom Cruise

153
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:59,040
on. Then trying. Here's how it works.

154
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,750
The international prototype is big Kahuna.

155
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,410
That's the one you used to calibrate
six identical platinum cylinders,

156
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:09,320
what they call witnesses
or Taiwan and French.

157
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:12,650
Those witnesses are then used to calibrate
another set of cylinders which are

158
00:09:12,651 --> 00:09:14,540
then used to calibrate the u s standards,

159
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:18,740
which is what we saw and that one is
used to calibrate all kinds of things.

160
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:22,760
The weight of your lemons, the
scale in your bathroom, green team,

161
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:26,570
you lost 34 pounds. Every time
somebody loses a pound on that TV show,

162
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:28,850
biggest loser, 5.8

163
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,740
you can actually trace that
like a bloodline if you will,

164
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:37,490
or an unbroken chain back to
the international prototype.

165
00:09:37,491 --> 00:09:40,940
Kilogram to a single object
in a basement in France,

166
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,940
the holy of holies. That is the kilogram.

167
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,760
Well, you're telling me that when
something is weighed in the world,

168
00:09:46,761 --> 00:09:50,150
often it goes all the way back
to this one hunk of metal,

169
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:55,680
which was why the next part of the
story is so, uh, disconcerting.

170
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:58,920
What happened in 1989 is
that according to Andrew,

171
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,860
the folks who take care of the
official kilograms, the big K,

172
00:10:01,990 --> 00:10:05,130
or they took it out of its jars,
they put it in a steam bath,

173
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:11,180
hit it with the steam, that rinses
everything, wait for it to dry.

174
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:15,450
Then they commence a
ceremonial way, right?

175
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:18,710
Well how do you waive the thing that is
the standard of wait while you weigh it

176
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:21,410
against the copies, like
the u s copy for example.

177
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,440
So they get one of those and they put it
on one side of the scale and then they

178
00:10:24,441 --> 00:10:29,441
put the gun k on the other and the IP
k the logo on because the one is light.

179
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:41,620
It's like it doesn't how
many, how many, how much

180
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,341
she does it later.

181
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:47,341
Is it then that sisters roughly
the mass of a grain of sugar.

182
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:52,810
Oh yeah. So I can't
tickets measurable. Wait,

183
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,660
how do they know that it was light and
not that the other ones were heavier,

184
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:59,920
right? Well they didn't. So they
used the second sister copies,

185
00:10:59,921 --> 00:11:03,760
still light and the third sister copies
still light in the fourth and fifth and

186
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:07,060
sixth didn't comes. The man from Germany,
light incomes. The man from Canada,

187
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,340
light incomes, the man from Spain light,

188
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,500
which led them to the
troubling possibility that the
international standard for

189
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:16,680
weight was losing weight. Well,

190
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,510
we think that we think the big guys,

191
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,960
the problem as far as how it lost
that weight, really no one knows.

192
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,680
One possibility is it got cleaned too
much and maybe some of it got scraped

193
00:11:25,681 --> 00:11:25,980
away.

194
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:29,160
Although it's disputed whether cleaning
it more would make it lose weight or

195
00:11:29,161 --> 00:11:29,750
gain weight.

196
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:34,220
The other theory is outgassing like
maybe a little hydrogen is seeping out of

197
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:37,730
the metal and then there was one thing
I read that said foul play can not be

198
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:38,630
ruled out. We'll see.

199
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,470
I was thinking maybe the Taliban was
clear as we may have a slightly trippy

200
00:11:42,471 --> 00:11:43,270
situation here.

201
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,550
We've got a hunk of metal losing weight
and yet because it is the standard,

202
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,890
it still weighs exactly a kilogram, right?

203
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:52,460
If the definition of a kilogram is the
mass of the international prototype

204
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:55,390
kilogram, whatever happens when
you put that thing on the scale,

205
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,410
that's a kilogram.

206
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,770
You can't do that and then everything
else in the world is wrong. No, you can't.

207
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,110
That doesn't sit right.

208
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,170
That's like something that like the
North Korean government would do just be

209
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,090
like no more cash like that.

210
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:10,730
We can't just go around
capriciously doing stuff like that.

211
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,740
Invisibilia is back for new
season with all new stories. Oh,

212
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:20,490
out of 22 arrival and yell, everyone
get down. This is a robbery.

213
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:24,630
We have stories about small personal
battles. I didn't leave my house.

214
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:29,690
I wanted somebody to see me really sorry
about the past and stories about huge

215
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,780
cultural issues. This is probably
gonna get somebody killed. Just evil.

216
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,090
You can hear Invisibilia in NPR one
or wherever you get your podcasts.

217
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,170
All right, so if the standard of weight
is, as you're saying, losing weight,

218
00:12:49,171 --> 00:12:53,640
so how do you fix that? Well, I'm getting
zero cell phone reception down here.

219
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:54,480
That means we're really do.

220
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,910
When we were down in that
underground room in Maryland,

221
00:12:56,911 --> 00:13:01,170
we met a guy who had some thoughts
about this. Oh, there he is. Okay.

222
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,460
His name's John Pratt.

223
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:06,570
I'm the leader of the fundamental
electrical measurements
group at the National

224
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:07,403
Institute of Standards and technology.

225
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,480
John walked us through even more high
security doors and then we walked into

226
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:17,130
this, oh my God, amazing room. It's big.

227
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,480
It is big up three stories
tall and it's made of,

228
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,620
it's like a silver room.
It has a silver gray floor.

229
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:30,570
It has silver shiny walls and you're
hearing is on the silvery side very much

230
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:33,910
so. You probably wouldn't be allowed
any if you're a red head [inaudible] no,

231
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,570
I don't even know how to describe it.

232
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,600
It looks like a wheel turned on its side
with the thing itself looked sort of

233
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:42,780
just like a,

234
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,840
like a massive round metal
cauldron or like big metal pot.

235
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,420
But then there are all these weird little
gizmos and parts and then all these

236
00:13:51,421 --> 00:13:54,390
coiled up wires and just
ate stunning machine.

237
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,900
But it's all just for
the benefit of the one.

238
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,520
The one measure one kilogram because
inside that giant [inaudible] and there is

239
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:07,521
an extremely extremely sensitive
balance and equal arm balance,

240
00:14:09,421 --> 00:14:11,820
which is basically like a
seesaw or a teeter totter.

241
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:17,060
And usually you would set that up so
that you would literally put kid on one

242
00:14:17,071 --> 00:14:19,500
side of the teeter totter kid on
the other side of the teeter totter.

243
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,330
Now you've been in a playground
so you know how this goes,

244
00:14:21,331 --> 00:14:24,090
but what they've done here is on
one side of the teeter totter,

245
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:26,160
they'd got the kilogram,
like the ground guy.

246
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:30,600
That's kid number one on the other side.
That of another kilogram or kid too.

247
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,860
We'll have a highly variable
magnet. Now here's the thing,

248
00:14:34,861 --> 00:14:37,200
the magnet won't be touching
that side of the scale.

249
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,800
It will be exerting a force at
invisible force on that side.

250
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:45,830
It'll produce a force and we could use
that to hold the balance still and the

251
00:14:46,771 --> 00:14:48,720
force it takes to hold up the balance.

252
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:52,310
That of course is the same as the weight
of [inaudible] car sitting on the other

253
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:56,390
side. And if you can convert that force
into a number that everybody agrees to,

254
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,293
Walleye,

255
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,670
you have just redefined the kilogram,

256
00:15:01,671 --> 00:15:05,900
you have wrenched it from the world of
things and it's become attached to the

257
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:10,040
fundamental forces of the universe.
Yep. [inaudible] grasp the gist of it.

258
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:12,110
[inaudible]

259
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,400
do you want to see that happen right now?

260
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:18,890
I can show you this with our lego
version of the watt balance. Okay.

261
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,230
If I can fire it up. Lego Lego
one. We'll see the, the, the,

262
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:24,720
the big one was being tested or something.

263
00:15:24,721 --> 00:15:27,510
So they took us over to look
at the little button. Okay.

264
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:30,960
So we have have a little scale
and everything you can see.

265
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:34,520
I just disturbed the balance and
it's, you know, chilling around oil.

266
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,780
It's free floating. Hey,

267
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,920
so you're now going with your tweezers
and you're plucking ITI. Bitty. Yup.

268
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,950
Two gram mass puts this tiny little
thimble thing on the mountain.

269
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:47,730
Now it's going to, he says
levitate. No, it's easy.

270
00:15:47,731 --> 00:15:52,290
It prompts me mass on Mass on, Huh?
Yeah. I'm going to put the mass on.

271
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:55,440
He pushes a button. Right and

272
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,240
okay, but when do we see the levitation?
That was it. I didn't, I missed it.

273
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:06,570
Do it again. Floating. It
was floating. It is floating.

274
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:09,650
Sitting on the balance. Okay,

275
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:14,250
and it's not floating that is
floating. Does it fall to earth?

276
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,300
That's a different idea of levitation. No.

277
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:21,120
The truth is that once I finally
figured out what this guy was doing,

278
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:24,310
it was actually sort of cool.
He had taken a little metal way.

279
00:16:24,311 --> 00:16:27,000
He put it on one side of the scale.
Then on the other side of the scale,

280
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:27,990
it was just empty,

281
00:16:27,991 --> 00:16:32,520
but yet the thing didn't tip over because
the MD side actually had a magnetic

282
00:16:32,521 --> 00:16:37,170
force equivalent to the metal
holding it just perfectly still.

283
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,970
Right. So if they're able to do that,

284
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:43,110
does that mean that the ground
k's rain is, is done now yet? No,

285
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:45,660
because first of all we the, you have
to get straight with a lot of mat.

286
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,420
Mc squared equals h new work backwards.

287
00:16:48,421 --> 00:16:52,560
You gotta divide by e and then by
amateur the B field. Whoo. Let's go.

288
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:55,170
I think you get your m peers and your
watts and your Planck's constant.

289
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,600
Lots of little bore model
of Adams and stuff. Anyway,

290
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:00,480
it is actually way more complicated.

291
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:03,240
This whole thing than I frankly
will live or understand.

292
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,160
But here's where we are at.

293
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,790
You got all these different
teams around the world.

294
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,060
You've got John's team in Maryland
with his seesaw. You got another lab,

295
00:17:12,061 --> 00:17:14,790
actually a couple of them that have
their seesaws. You've got a third lab.

296
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,090
It's literally counting the atoms.
They're all doing experiments,

297
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,760
comparing numbers, trying
to get the numbers to agree.

298
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:25,761
So that by whatever route everybody
agrees on exactly what a kilogram is right

299
00:17:26,221 --> 00:17:27,490
now, they're close there.

300
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,650
They're in agreement out to about six
decimal places and that's not good enough.

301
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:35,400
They want the numbers to be at the eight
decimal places. But if they can do that

302
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:42,320
and only then will the
grand k be no more. Yeah.

303
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,340
Because instead of defining the kilogram
as whatever is equal to the ground k

304
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,450
now you have a new, the new
definition of the kilogram,

305
00:17:51,451 --> 00:17:54,480
the kilogram is the siu unit of mass.

306
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:58,240
It's magnitude is set by
fixing the numerical value
of the Planck constant to be

307
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,343
equal to exactly

308
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,940
6.626069 and we have x's because we
haven't all agreed what the final, okay.

309
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:05,430
Those,

310
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:09,390
the missing decimals are the limb missing
decimal places times 10 to minus 34

311
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:14,070
when it's expressed in the unit for
actions. Jewel seconds, which is um,

312
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,710
a meter squared kilogram per second. Cool.

313
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,250
That'll be such a simpler
definition. Oh yeah. No. You've,

314
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,390
what will happen to the grand k when
the new definition goes into effect?

315
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:27,920
Well that,

316
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:32,920
so this is the sad part
was that [inaudible] it's
like a church you each will

317
00:18:33,541 --> 00:18:36,840
receive to the church.
We have the footballs,

318
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:41,600
the ground K me eventually end up
in a place like this. [inaudible]

319
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:47,580
we're so many standards have gone to
die. This is the music. These are,

320
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,710
they met in Paris. So this is the
beginning show 85 so was our tour guide.

321
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:56,790
Yeah. What is this a lead [inaudible]
you showed us the original liter

322
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,280
[inaudible] some early thermometers.
Yeah. And the VJ, but that's

323
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,930
[inaudible] room. He
showed us your original,

324
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,270
I think it was the provision meters
when Paris, this was the infallible,

325
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:14,360
the absolute standards from 1801 I
think it's in a wooden box with a velvet

326
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:20,720
packing and it's got silk ribbons at
either end and it's just a very beautiful

327
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,300
looking silver rod.

328
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,280
Oh till imagine like the, the thing,
the grand thing being in this place.

329
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,900
So you like seeing the pope and shorts
with something makes me so uncomfortable.

330
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:50,820
[inaudible]

331
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,110
special thanks to

332
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,860
Eric Rominger and also to take when we
don't want to forget. Richard Davis.

333
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,200
Ken Older Bob Waters. Michael.
Michael Newman and fine.

334
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,580
Thank you to our math angels soprano.

335
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:13,830
Very weird to sing my own name. Also,
big props to reporter Andrew Moran,

336
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:18,560
so lots of Nasr and our
producer. Then leaving and uh Oh,

337
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,890
oh, uh, also, uh,

338
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:24,100
you should go to radiolab.org not only
to support the show by clicking the

339
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:24,701
support button,

340
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:29,230
but also to check out a collaboration
video that we did with Henry Rice from

341
00:20:29,530 --> 00:20:30,363
minute physics.

342
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:35,200
You can see it@radiolab.org or
also youtube.com/minute physics,

343
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:40,170
yet another meditation on what
things are unthinkable. Oh,

344
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:44,170
all about. I'm Jad Abumrad I am
Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.
