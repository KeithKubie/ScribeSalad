00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:07.776
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Welcome, all.

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:13.036
As of today, April 27, senior
sign-in day, over 95 percent

00:00:13.036 --> 00:00:16.696
of the seniors have been accepted to
at least 2 colleges and universities.

00:00:17.316 --> 00:00:19.176
&gt;&gt;Narrator: A core
principle of YES Prep is

00:00:19.176 --> 00:00:23.696
that every student will
attend and succeed in college.

00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:26.626
&gt;&gt;Mark: We have this high expectation
that all kids go to college,

00:00:26.896 --> 00:00:28.606
but we don't leave it there.

00:00:28.606 --> 00:00:31.276
We kind of backwards-plan from there:
Here are the things that we need

00:00:31.276 --> 00:00:33.866
to do in order to make sure
that kids are going to be ready.

00:00:34.726 --> 00:00:36.986
&gt;&gt;Narrator: YES Prep's
college-bound culture is built

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:41.096
on three key components: an
environment of expectation...

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:42.686
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So now let me
see your college list.

00:00:43.156 --> 00:00:45.036
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...a college-prep
seminar class...

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.426
&gt;&gt;Guide: And this is the bookstore.

00:00:46.636 --> 00:00:48.106
We can take a look in there.

00:00:48.286 --> 00:00:49.906
&gt;&gt;Narrator: ...and
college-campus visits,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:53.456
where students experience the
look and feel of a college.

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:54.576
&gt;&gt;Guide: Now we'll go to the gym.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:56.356
There is fitness classes here...

00:00:56.356 --> 00:00:58.486
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The promise of
a college education begins

00:00:58.486 --> 00:01:01.166
with a home visit and
contract-signing.

00:01:01.756 --> 00:01:04.686
&gt;&gt;Chris: The home visits are when
we go through the contract with them

00:01:04.686 --> 00:01:06.326
and their parents and we talk about,

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.006
"This is what it means
to be a student at YES."

00:01:08.076 --> 00:01:08.606
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Good to meet you.

00:01:09.586 --> 00:01:10.616
I'm going to give you a copy of...

00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:12.226
&gt;&gt;Chris: The contract is
good because it's symbolic.

00:01:12.226 --> 00:01:13.876
What we want parents to understand is

00:01:13.876 --> 00:01:15.336
that this has got to
be a team effort.

00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:17.116
This is a three-legged stool.

00:01:17.116 --> 00:01:19.716
It's us; it's your kid; and it's you.

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.226
And if we work together for the
next seven years, your kid's going

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:23.836
to be able to go to any
college they want to.

00:01:23.836 --> 00:01:25.646
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And then sign under
the "student signature," please.

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:28.656
&gt;&gt;Chad: By the time the students get
to 11th grade they've been talking

00:01:28.656 --> 00:01:31.486
about college since the 6th
grade, and they've got homerooms

00:01:31.486 --> 00:01:33.596
that are named after colleges
and people are asking them

00:01:33.596 --> 00:01:34.676
where they want to go to college,

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.586
and even though they
really don't have any idea--

00:01:36.586 --> 00:01:38.906
and they shouldn't necessarily
have any idea at that point--

00:01:38.906 --> 00:01:40.506
they at least know that
they want to go to college

00:01:40.506 --> 00:01:41.926
and they're all focused on that.

00:01:41.926 --> 00:01:43.546
&gt;&gt;Student: But you can
apply as soon as possible

00:01:43.546 --> 00:01:45.016
into August through October.

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:47.456
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In the
college-prep seminar class,

00:01:47.756 --> 00:01:51.896
juniors spend a year learning how
to select and apply to colleges.

00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:54.956
&gt;&gt;Chad: It's basically a
College Prep 101-type class,

00:01:55.166 --> 00:01:56.396
so a lot of SAT/ACT prep.

00:01:56.396 --> 00:02:00.726
We take the students through what the
admissions process will look like,

00:02:00.936 --> 00:02:02.646
focus on building their
college lists.

00:02:02.686 --> 00:02:03.946
We'll talk about applications.

00:02:03.946 --> 00:02:06.246
We talk about financial
aid, scholarships,

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.676
so that when it becomes
college-application season

00:02:08.676 --> 00:02:09.446
that they're ready to go.

00:02:09.666 --> 00:02:10.386
&gt;&gt;"Areas of Study."

00:02:10.556 --> 00:02:11.226
Click on that.

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.726
&gt;&gt;One of the benefits of the
extended day is that we have

00:02:13.726 --> 00:02:16.986
that extra two hours per day
that most schools don't have,

00:02:17.486 --> 00:02:19.126
and it allows you to
do something like this,

00:02:19.126 --> 00:02:22.036
where the students can come in every
day, and it's valuable not only

00:02:22.086 --> 00:02:24.776
for the time that they get but also
the relationships that are built

00:02:24.776 --> 00:02:26.646
between the students and
the college counselors,

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:28.306
just because it would
be impossible for us

00:02:28.306 --> 00:02:31.556
to truly recommend the right schools
and to put them in the right position

00:02:31.556 --> 00:02:34.106
if we didn't really get to know them.

00:02:34.106 --> 00:02:34.926
&gt;&gt;Teacher: All right, well,

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:36.586
welcome to the University
of St. Thomas, everyone.

00:02:36.686 --> 00:02:40.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: To help students get a
sense of college life, YES takes them

00:02:40.046 --> 00:02:42.476
on field trips to a
variety of campuses.

00:02:42.946 --> 00:02:45.366
&gt;&gt;Mark: Over the course of
a student's history at YES,

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:49.926
that student's going to see 20 to 25
schools, actually go to the campus

00:02:49.926 --> 00:02:51.816
and be on that campus
and meet students

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:54.226
and meet professors on that campus.

00:02:54.306 --> 00:02:55.866
&gt;&gt;Guide: What do you
all think so far?

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:58.536
&gt;&gt;Student: I think I like that
it's in the center of Houston.

00:02:58.536 --> 00:02:59.396
&gt;&gt;Chad: It's just exposure.

00:02:59.756 --> 00:03:04.406
So much of finding your fit and sort
of picturing yourself on campus has

00:03:04.406 --> 00:03:07.106
to do with actually getting on
the campus and being able to see

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:10.586
for yourself, and so we're able to
hold classes on a college campus

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:13.476
and then tie that in with an
information session and a tour...

00:03:13.696 --> 00:03:15.226
&gt;&gt;Guide: Right here is the lounge.

00:03:15.226 --> 00:03:17.626
&gt;&gt;Chad: ...so they can really
picture themselves there and try

00:03:17.626 --> 00:03:19.296
to get a sense as to
what it might be like.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:20.856
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And over 90 percent

00:03:20.856 --> 00:03:23.196
of this year's graduates
are first-generation

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:24.466
college-bound students.

00:03:24.466 --> 00:03:25.706
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:03:25.706 --> 00:03:27.676
&gt;&gt;Craig: Every year the
seniors get together

00:03:27.896 --> 00:03:32.156
and they sign their acceptance
letters to college, all at one time,

00:03:32.196 --> 00:03:35.426
in front of their friends and
their family in a huge auditorium.

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:36.396
&gt;&gt;Diana: Good afternoon.

00:03:36.396 --> 00:03:39.506
My name is Diana Rivera, and this
fall I will be attending Columbia

00:03:39.506 --> 00:03:42.916
University in the city of New York.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:42.983
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:03:42.983 --> 00:03:45.776
&gt;&gt;Craig: I remember signing my
acceptance letter on a kitchen table,

00:03:45.936 --> 00:03:48.186
and I think maybe my mom
walked by while I did.

00:03:48.186 --> 00:03:50.926
&gt;&gt;Student: And this fall I'll be
attending Texas A&amp;M University.

00:03:51.476 --> 00:03:55.936
&gt;&gt;Craig: This is 100 times bigger,
and it means so much to these kids.

00:03:57.586 --> 00:03:58.976
&gt;&gt;Student: ...where I'll be
majoring in biomedical engineering.

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:01.096
&gt;&gt;Craig: And when our kids
walk across that stage

00:04:01.096 --> 00:04:02.636
and they sign those letters...

00:04:03.256 --> 00:04:03.706
&gt;&gt;Nelson: Good afternoon.

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:07.346
My name is Nelson Mendoza and
this fall I will be attending

00:04:07.916 --> 00:04:08.916
Yale University.

00:04:09.026 --> 00:04:11.026
&gt;&gt;All: [cheers]

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:12.136
&gt;&gt;Craig: ...it's exactly
what we've been working

00:04:12.136 --> 00:04:16.916
for for the past eight years.

00:04:17.046 --> 00:04:18.566
