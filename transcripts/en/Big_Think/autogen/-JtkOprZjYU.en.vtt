so one of the things that worries me the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.180
so one of the things that worries me the
 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.260
so one of the things that worries me the
most in the technology world today is

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:10.270
most in the technology world today is
 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.959
most in the technology world today is
the degree to which the external world

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969
the degree to which the external world
 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.000
the degree to which the external world
has viewed technology with more and more

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010
has viewed technology with more and more
 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.359
has viewed technology with more and more
cynicism and the degree to which you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.369
cynicism and the degree to which you
 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:19.650
cynicism and the degree to which you
know there's a little bit of a backlash

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660
know there's a little bit of a backlash
 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.409
know there's a little bit of a backlash
starting and I think that there's a few

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419
starting and I think that there's a few
 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:23.579
starting and I think that there's a few
drivers for that I think the recent

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589
drivers for that I think the recent
 

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:25.769
drivers for that I think the recent
elections is sort of one example where

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779
elections is sort of one example where
 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.239
elections is sort of one example where
people feel that they were manipulated I

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:27.249
people feel that they were manipulated I
 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.919
people feel that they were manipulated I
should say by third parties of using

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:28.929
should say by third parties of using
 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.550
should say by third parties of using
technology and I think separate from

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:32.560
technology and I think separate from
 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.350
technology and I think separate from
that there's also just these sort of

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360
that there's also just these sort of
 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.720
that there's also just these sort of
media waves where you know media tends

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730
media waves where you know media tends
 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.369
media waves where you know media tends
to go in cycles where the press will

00:00:38.369 --> 00:00:38.379
to go in cycles where the press will
 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:39.569
to go in cycles where the press will
build something up and then tear it down

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579
build something up and then tear it down
 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:40.889
build something up and then tear it down
and then build something up and tear it

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899
and then build something up and tear it
 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.990
and then build something up and tear it
down and I think technology was really

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000
down and I think technology was really
 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.790
down and I think technology was really
built up in the media for a 20-year

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800
built up in the media for a 20-year
 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.189
built up in the media for a 20-year
period or so and now is sort of a time

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199
period or so and now is sort of a time
 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:49.860
period or so and now is sort of a time
of reckoning and to some extent I think

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870
of reckoning and to some extent I think
 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.200
of reckoning and to some extent I think
that's very unfortunate because I

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210
that's very unfortunate because I
 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.299
that's very unfortunate because I
believe that optimism is a reflexive

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309
believe that optimism is a reflexive
 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.040
believe that optimism is a reflexive
asset and sort of the George Soros view

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050
asset and sort of the George Soros view
 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.840
asset and sort of the George Soros view
of the world where you know something

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850
of the world where you know something
 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.290
of the world where you know something
that people give value to gains value by

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300
that people give value to gains value by
 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.759
that people give value to gains value by
that belief in the value of that thing

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:02.769
that belief in the value of that thing
 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.030
that belief in the value of that thing
and if you actually look at the major

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040
and if you actually look at the major
 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.530
and if you actually look at the major
changes that have happened in the world

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540
changes that have happened in the world
 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.660
changes that have happened in the world
it's because people have been extremely

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670
it's because people have been extremely
 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.490
it's because people have been extremely
optimistic in ways that some folks

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500
optimistic in ways that some folks
 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.100
optimistic in ways that some folks
thought were was irrational but that

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110
thought were was irrational but that
 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.420
thought were was irrational but that
optimism allowed them to actually

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430
optimism allowed them to actually
 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.980
optimism allowed them to actually
accomplish that giant goal I mean think

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990
accomplish that giant goal I mean think
 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.260
accomplish that giant goal I mean think
of putting somebody on the moon and what

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270
of putting somebody on the moon and what
 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.080
of putting somebody on the moon and what
we were able to accomplish in the 60s or

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090
we were able to accomplish in the 60s or
 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.520
we were able to accomplish in the 60s or
you know think about a variety of other

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530
you know think about a variety of other
 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.230
you know think about a variety of other
examples like that the Manhattan Project

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240
examples like that the Manhattan Project
 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.150
examples like that the Manhattan Project
or you know major breakthroughs have all

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160
or you know major breakthroughs have all
 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.920
or you know major breakthroughs have all
sort of come through an enormous sense

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930
sort of come through an enormous sense
 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.620
sort of come through an enormous sense
of optimism and we can do this manifest

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630
of optimism and we can do this manifest
 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.630
of optimism and we can do this manifest
destiny and sort of you know the

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640
destiny and sort of you know the
 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.100
destiny and sort of you know the
development of the United States as a

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110
development of the United States as a
 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.720
development of the United States as a
country is a good example of that on the

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730
country is a good example of that on the
 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.330
country is a good example of that on the
sort of country and governance level and

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340
sort of country and governance level and
 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.220
sort of country and governance level and
so one thing that I've seen more and

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230
so one thing that I've seen more and
 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.160
so one thing that I've seen more and
more increasingly is a increase in

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170
more increasingly is a increase in
 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.800
more increasingly is a increase in
cynicism and people being made fun of

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810
cynicism and people being made fun of
 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.880
cynicism and people being made fun of
for saying they want to change the world

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890
for saying they want to change the world
 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.530
for saying they want to change the world
when they're genuine about it and I

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540
when they're genuine about it and I
 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.720
when they're genuine about it and I
think that's a very big negative and so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:51.730
think that's a very big negative and so
 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.220
think that's a very big negative and so
one of my one of the things I've been

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230
one of my one of the things I've been
 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.930
one of my one of the things I've been
thinking a lot about recently is how can

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940
thinking a lot about recently is how can
 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.550
thinking a lot about recently is how can
you actually increase societal optimism

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
you actually increase societal optimism
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.410
you actually increase societal optimism
what are the mechanisms by which people

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420
what are the mechanisms by which people
 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.970
what are the mechanisms by which people
can become more enthusiastic about their

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980
can become more enthusiastic about their
 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.680
can become more enthusiastic about their
future and more enthusiastic about

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690
future and more enthusiastic about
 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.240
future and more enthusiastic about
technology because if you look at the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250
technology because if you look at the
 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.040
technology because if you look at the
changes the technology has wrought over

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050
changes the technology has wrought over
 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.690
changes the technology has wrought over
the last twenty thirty years it

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700
the last twenty thirty years it
 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.719
the last twenty thirty years it
literally has lifted tens or hundreds of

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729
literally has lifted tens or hundreds of
 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.640
literally has lifted tens or hundreds of
millions of people out of poverty it has

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650
millions of people out of poverty it has
 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.559
millions of people out of poverty it has
created access to global markets it has

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569
created access to global markets it has
 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.930
created access to global markets it has
created access to global information

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940
created access to global information
 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.460
created access to global information
you know everybody's walking around with

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470
you know everybody's walking around with
 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.780
you know everybody's walking around with
literally a supercomputer in their

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790
literally a supercomputer in their
 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.910
literally a supercomputer in their
pocket that gives them access to the sum

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920
pocket that gives them access to the sum
 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.190
pocket that gives them access to the sum
of all of humanity's knowledge with

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
of all of humanity's knowledge with
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.240
of all of humanity's knowledge with
maybe the exception of scientific

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250
maybe the exception of scientific
 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.130
maybe the exception of scientific
journals which are still blocked so I do

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140
journals which are still blocked so I do
 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.140
journals which are still blocked so I do
think that people should be incredibly

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150
think that people should be incredibly
 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.180
think that people should be incredibly
optimistic about the future and one

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190
optimistic about the future and one
 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:31.500
optimistic about the future and one
thing I wonder about is how can you help

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510
thing I wonder about is how can you help
 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.449
thing I wonder about is how can you help
spread that optimism because I think if

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459
spread that optimism because I think if
 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:34.949
spread that optimism because I think if
people believe they can do something

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959
people believe they can do something
 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.120
people believe they can do something
they often achieve things that they

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
they often achieve things that they
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.430
they often achieve things that they
never thought was possible so a lot of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440
never thought was possible so a lot of
 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.350
never thought was possible so a lot of
people have recently had a lot of very

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360
people have recently had a lot of very
 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.270
people have recently had a lot of very
cogent concerns around the rise of

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280
cogent concerns around the rise of
 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.270
cogent concerns around the rise of
misinformation and disinformation on

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280
misinformation and disinformation on
 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.890
misinformation and disinformation on
social media platforms and how that

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900
social media platforms and how that
 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.160
social media platforms and how that
impacted our last election and you know

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170
impacted our last election and you know
 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.000
impacted our last election and you know
I think those are very legitimate

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010
I think those are very legitimate
 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.470
I think those are very legitimate
concerns and I think some of the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480
concerns and I think some of the
 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.699
concerns and I think some of the
platforms have made pretty major

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709
platforms have made pretty major
 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:54.780
platforms have made pretty major
mistakes in terms of how they've

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790
mistakes in terms of how they've
 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.150
mistakes in terms of how they've
approached some of those things it's

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160
approached some of those things it's
 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.229
approached some of those things it's
interesting though because if you look

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239
interesting though because if you look
 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.870
interesting though because if you look
at it over the arc of history this is

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880
at it over the arc of history this is
 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.670
at it over the arc of history this is
not a new story every time that there's

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
not a new story every time that there's
 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.710
not a new story every time that there's
a new technology particularly around

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720
a new technology particularly around
 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.080
a new technology particularly around
media there's a set of out cries around
