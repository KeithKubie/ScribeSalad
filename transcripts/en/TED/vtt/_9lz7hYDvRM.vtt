00:00:13.984 --> 00:00:16.737
(Music)

00:00:21.357 --> 00:00:23.972
We are the tribe that they cannot see

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:27.745
We live on an industrial reservation

00:00:29.244 --> 00:00:32.304
We are the Halluci Nation

00:00:33.331 --> 00:00:35.397
We have been called the Indians

00:00:36.513 --> 00:00:38.831
We have been called Native American

00:00:40.108 --> 00:00:41.908
We have been called hostile

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.958
We have been called pagan

00:00:46.741 --> 00:00:48.607
We have been called militant

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:51.920
We have been called many names

00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:56.110
We are the Halluci Nation

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.535
We are the human beings

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.655
The callers of names cannot see us

00:01:04.577 --> 00:01:06.173
but we can see them

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:10.477
We are the Halluci Nation

00:01:11.268 --> 00:01:14.367
Our DNA is of earth and sky

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:18.562
Our DNA is of past and future

00:01:19.834 --> 00:01:22.149
We are the Halluci Nation

00:01:23.919 --> 00:01:25.819
We are the evolution,

00:01:27.067 --> 00:01:28.471
the continuation

00:01:35.181 --> 00:01:37.022
The Halluci Nation

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:40.505
(Music)

00:02:27.052 --> 00:02:28.744
The virus took on many shapes

00:02:28.768 --> 00:02:31.424
The bear, the elk, the antelope,
the elephant, the deer

00:02:31.448 --> 00:02:34.212
The mineral, the iron, the copper,
the coltan, the rubber

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.436
The coffee, the cotton, the sugar

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.560
The people

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.040
The germ traveled faster than the bullet

00:02:44.196 --> 00:02:45.625
They harvest the mountainside,

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:47.482
protect the crops, herd the cattle

00:02:47.885 --> 00:02:49.035
The people

00:02:53.276 --> 00:02:55.967
The women and children
were separated from the men

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:59.231
They divided us according to the regional
filters of their minds

00:02:59.815 --> 00:03:02.514
The violence of arrogance
crawls into the air,

00:03:02.538 --> 00:03:04.909
nestles into the geospatial cortex

00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:09.085
We are not a conquered people

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:15.049
The compound was on fire

00:03:17.077 --> 00:03:19.433
The missionaries never hid
their perspective

00:03:20.474 --> 00:03:22.029
Prospectors of land

00:03:22.053 --> 00:03:23.987
would rather see us disappear

00:03:26.185 --> 00:03:27.585
Recyclable prayers

00:03:28.796 --> 00:03:29.946
The people

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:34.668
This is my body which is given for you

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.009
The people

00:03:37.768 --> 00:03:38.918
This is my blood

00:03:40.982 --> 00:03:42.926
We are not a conquered people

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.150
(Electronic music and chanting)

00:03:59.911 --> 00:04:01.857
I was wakened by my elder brother

00:04:03.013 --> 00:04:04.598
The compound was on fire

00:04:06.641 --> 00:04:08.508
Awakened by my elder brother

00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:11.256
The compound was on fire

00:04:11.585 --> 00:04:14.585
(Music)

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:25.372
The compound was on fire

00:04:37.794 --> 00:04:39.394
The compound was on fire

00:04:54.937 --> 00:04:56.387
The Halluci Nation

00:04:57.911 --> 00:04:59.061
The human beings

00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:01.866
The people

00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:05.370
See the spiritual in the natural

00:05:06.404 --> 00:05:08.071
Through sense and feeling

00:05:09.513 --> 00:05:11.014
Everything is related

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:13.291
All the things of earth

00:05:14.083 --> 00:05:15.816
And in the sky have spirit

00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:18.369
Everything is sacred

00:05:20.085 --> 00:05:23.242
Confronted by the ALie Nation

00:05:25.364 --> 00:05:27.066
The subjects and the citizens

00:05:28.022 --> 00:05:29.755
See the material religions

00:05:30.458 --> 00:05:32.475
Through trauma and numb

00:05:33.355 --> 00:05:34.555
Nothing is related

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.799
All the things of the earth and in the sky

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.863
have energy to be exploited

00:05:43.117 --> 00:05:46.600
Even themselves, mining their spirits

00:05:46.624 --> 00:05:48.844
into souls sold

00:05:50.339 --> 00:05:51.806
Into nothing is sacred

00:05:52.596 --> 00:05:54.257
Not even their self

00:05:56.712 --> 00:05:58.998
The ALie Nation

00:05:59.022 --> 00:06:00.564
Alienation

00:06:53.615 --> 00:06:54.765
Ancestors

00:06:55.481 --> 00:06:57.534
Live in the DNA

00:06:58.256 --> 00:07:00.033
In genetic memory

00:07:00.558 --> 00:07:03.019
The evolution of descendants

00:07:03.676 --> 00:07:06.398
Human being is our natural identity

00:07:08.236 --> 00:07:11.734
Natural identity
is where the power of being

00:07:12.385 --> 00:07:14.876
Waits for human recognition

00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:17.137
To understand

00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:19.723
Not to just know

00:07:20.214 --> 00:07:22.519
But to understand sacred

00:07:24.896 --> 00:07:27.744
Without religion we evolve

00:07:28.062 --> 00:07:30.506
Back into our ancestors

00:07:31.363 --> 00:07:33.795
With religion we disappear

00:07:34.292 --> 00:07:37.141
Into religious heaven and hell

00:07:37.165 --> 00:07:40.365
(Electronic music and chanting)

00:07:40.896 --> 00:07:42.046
Human beings

00:07:43.175 --> 00:07:46.484
We are human, we are of the earth

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:49.708
(Electronic music and chanting)

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:28.278
Human beings

00:10:29.291 --> 00:10:30.442
We are human

00:10:31.577 --> 00:10:32.844
We are of the earth

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:35.461
Our bone, flesh, blood,

00:10:36.482 --> 00:10:39.141
metals, minerals, liquids, of earth

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.270
We are earth

00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:44.271
We are being

00:10:45.092 --> 00:10:46.242
We are of the sky

00:10:47.470 --> 00:10:49.244
The sun, moon, stars

00:10:49.855 --> 00:10:54.081
A reality of how ancestors live

00:10:55.063 --> 00:10:59.054
We are the children of earth and sky

00:11:07.376 --> 00:11:10.753
We are the Halluci Nation

00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:17.086
(Applause)

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:20.151
(Cheering)

00:11:20.175 --> 00:11:25.539
(Applause)
