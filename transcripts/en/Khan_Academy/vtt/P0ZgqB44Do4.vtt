00:00:00.271 --> 00:00:03.428
Voiceover: We have F of X
is equal to three X squared

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:10.060
minus 18X minus 81, over
six X squared minus 54.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.878
Now what I want to do in this video

00:00:11.878 --> 00:00:15.127
is find the equations for the horizontal

00:00:15.127 --> 00:00:17.213
and vertical asymptotes

00:00:17.213 --> 00:00:20.111
and I encourage you to
pause the video right now

00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:21.480
and try to work it out on your own

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.801
before I try to work through it.

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:26.509
I'm assuming you've had a go at it.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.083
Let's think about each of them.

00:00:28.083 --> 00:00:35.071
Let's first think about
the horizontal asymptote,

00:00:35.071 --> 00:00:37.374
see if there at least is one.

00:00:37.374 --> 00:00:41.822
The horizontal asymptote
is really what is the line,

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:45.250
the horizontal line that F of X approaches

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.291
as the absolute value of X approaches,

00:00:49.291 --> 00:00:52.981
as the absolute value
of X approaches infinity

00:00:52.981 --> 00:00:55.868
or you could say what does F of X approach

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.912
as X approaches infinity

00:00:57.912 --> 00:01:00.260
and what does F of X approach

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.571
as X approaches negative infinity.

00:01:03.571 --> 00:01:06.172
There's a couple of ways
you could think about it.

00:01:06.172 --> 00:01:08.861
Let me just rewrite the
definition of F of X

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:09.789
right over here.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:15.566
It's three X squared minus 18X minus 81.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:21.224
All of that over six X squared minus 54.

00:01:21.224 --> 00:01:23.726
Now there's two ways you
could think about it.

00:01:23.726 --> 00:01:24.759
One you could say, okay,

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:27.955
as X as the absolute value of X

00:01:27.955 --> 00:01:30.113
becomes larger and larger and larger,

00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:32.854
the highest degree terms in the numerator

00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:39.264
and the denominator are going to dominate.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:41.325
What are the highest degree terms?

00:01:41.325 --> 00:01:44.294
Well the numerator you
have three X squared

00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:46.813
and in the denominator
you have six X squared.

00:01:46.813 --> 00:01:53.248
As X approaches, as
the absolute value of X

00:01:53.248 --> 00:01:54.624
approaches infinity,

00:01:54.624 --> 00:01:56.559
these two terms are going to dominate.

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:02.777
F of X is going to become
approximately three X squared

00:02:02.777 --> 00:02:04.980
over six X squared.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.896
These other terms are going to matter less

00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:09.304
obviously minus 54 isn't
going to grow at all

00:02:09.304 --> 00:02:11.687
and minus 18X is going to grow much slower

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.027
than the three X squared,

00:02:14.027 --> 00:02:17.318
the highest degree terms are
going to be what dominates.

00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:19.396
If we look at just those terms

00:02:19.396 --> 00:02:22.483
then you could think of
simplifying it in this way.

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:24.843
F of X is going to get closer and closer

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:27.893
to 3/6 or 1/2.

00:02:27.893 --> 00:02:30.332
You could say that there's
a horizontal asymptote

00:02:30.332 --> 00:02:35.542
at Y is equal to 1/2.

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.371
Another way we could
have thought about this

00:02:37.371 --> 00:02:39.734
if you don't like this whole little bit

00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:43.206
of hand wavy argument that
these two terms dominate

00:02:43.206 --> 00:02:46.401
is that we can divide the
numerator and the denominator

00:02:46.401 --> 00:02:49.756
by the highest degree or X
raised to the highest power

00:02:49.756 --> 00:02:51.325
in the numerator and the denominator.

00:02:51.325 --> 00:02:54.438
The highest degree term is
X squared in the numerator.

00:02:54.438 --> 00:02:57.838
Let's divide the numerator
and the denominator

00:02:57.838 --> 00:02:59.688
or I should say the highest degree term

00:02:59.688 --> 00:03:01.875
in the numerator and the
denominator is X squared.

00:03:01.875 --> 00:03:03.630
Let's divide both the numerator

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:05.033
and denominator by that.

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:10.216
If you multiply the numerator
times one over X squared

00:03:10.216 --> 00:03:13.530
and the denominator
times one over X squared.

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.776
Notice we're not changing the value

00:03:15.776 --> 00:03:19.656
of the entire expression,
we're just multiplying it

00:03:19.656 --> 00:03:22.355
times one if we assume
X is not equal zero.

00:03:23.462 --> 00:03:25.005
We get two.

00:03:25.005 --> 00:03:27.723
In our numerator, let's
see three X squared

00:03:27.723 --> 00:03:29.497
divided by X squared is going to be three

00:03:29.497 --> 00:03:36.073
minus 18 over X minus 81 over X squared

00:03:36.073 --> 00:03:39.080
and then all of that over six X squared

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.412
times one over X squared,
this is going to be six

00:03:41.412 --> 00:03:45.765
and then minus 54 over X squared.

00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:47.638
What's going to happen?

00:03:47.638 --> 00:03:50.622
If you want to think in terms of

00:03:50.622 --> 00:03:52.730
if you want to think of limits

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.417
as something approaches infinity.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.106
If you want to say the limit as X

00:03:57.106 --> 00:03:58.455
approaches infinity here.

00:03:58.455 --> 00:03:59.408
What's going to happen?

00:03:59.408 --> 00:04:03.297
Well this, this and that
are going to approach zero

00:04:03.297 --> 00:04:08.750
so you're going to approach 3/6 or 1/2.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.900
Now, if you say this X
approaches negative infinity,

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:11.955
it would be the same thing.

00:04:11.955 --> 00:04:14.356
This, this and this approach zero

00:04:14.356 --> 00:04:17.391
and once again you approach 1/2.

00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.271
That's the horizontal asymptote.

00:04:19.271 --> 00:04:21.744
Y is equal to 1/2.

00:04:21.744 --> 00:04:24.642
Let's think about the vertical asymptotes.

00:04:24.642 --> 00:04:27.556
Let me write that down right over here.

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:29.429
Let me scroll over a little bit.

00:04:29.429 --> 00:04:37.148
Vertical asymptote or possibly asymptotes.

00:04:37.148 --> 00:04:40.508
Vertical maybe there is more than one.

00:04:40.508 --> 00:04:42.808
Now it might be very tempting to say,

00:04:42.808 --> 00:04:44.623
"Okay, you hit a vertical asymptote"

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:47.277
"whenever the denominator equals to zero"

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:49.817
"which would make this
rational expression undefined"

00:04:49.817 --> 00:04:51.894
and as we'll see for this case

00:04:51.894 --> 00:04:55.258
that is not exactly right.

00:04:55.258 --> 00:04:58.461
Just making the denominator
equal to zero by itself

00:04:58.461 --> 00:05:00.700
will not make a vertical asymptote.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.692
It will definitely be a place

00:05:01.692 --> 00:05:03.003
where the function is undefined

00:05:03.003 --> 00:05:05.785
but by itself it does not
make a vertical asymptote.

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.574
Let's just think about this
denominator right over here

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.004
so we can factor it out.

00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:11.257
Actually let's factor out the numerator

00:05:11.257 --> 00:05:12.298
and the denominator.

00:05:12.298 --> 00:05:16.636
We can rewrite this as F of
X is equal to the numerator

00:05:16.636 --> 00:05:19.155
is clearly every term
is divisible by three

00:05:19.155 --> 00:05:20.253
so let's factor out three.

00:05:20.253 --> 00:05:22.670
It's going to be three times X squared

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.278
minus six X minus 27.

00:05:26.278 --> 00:05:29.680
All of that over the denominator

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.713
each term is divisible by six.

00:05:31.713 --> 00:05:35.495
Six times X squared minus 9

00:05:35.495 --> 00:05:38.578
and let's see if we can
factor the numerators

00:05:38.578 --> 00:05:40.890
and denominators out further.

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:45.993
This is going to be F of
X is equal to three times

00:05:45.993 --> 00:05:50.106
let's see, two numbers,
their product is negative 27,

00:05:50.106 --> 00:05:51.578
their sum is negative six.

00:05:51.578 --> 00:05:54.355
Negative nine and three seem to work.

00:05:54.355 --> 00:05:58.763
You could have X minus
nine times X plus three.

00:05:58.763 --> 00:06:01.930
Just factor the numerator
over the denominator.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.000
This is the difference of
squares right over here.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.507
This would be X minus
three times X plus three.

00:06:08.507 --> 00:06:13.187
When does the denominator equal zero?

00:06:13.187 --> 00:06:18.379
The denominator equals zero

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:22.420
when X is equal to positive three

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:26.262
or X is equal to negative three.

00:06:26.262 --> 00:06:28.402
Now I encourage you to pause
this video for a second.

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:32.202
Think about are both of
these vertical asymptotes?

00:06:32.202 --> 00:06:35.310
Well you might realize that the numerator

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.177
also equals zero when X is
equal to negative three.

00:06:40.177 --> 00:06:43.325
What we can do is actually
simplify this a little bit

00:06:43.325 --> 00:06:44.723
and then it becomes a little bit clear

00:06:44.723 --> 00:06:46.548
where our vertical asymptotes are.

00:06:46.548 --> 00:06:48.483
We could say that F of X,

00:06:48.483 --> 00:06:51.110
we could essentially divide the numerator

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.620
and denominator by X plus three

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:54.675
and we just have to key,

00:06:54.675 --> 00:06:56.247
if we want the function to be identical,

00:06:56.247 --> 00:06:58.701
we have to keep the [caveat]
that the function itself

00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.074
is not defined when X is
equal to negative three.

00:07:02.074 --> 00:07:04.952
That definitely did
make us divide by zero.

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:06.134
We have to remember that

00:07:06.134 --> 00:07:08.361
but that will simplify the expression.

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.229
This exact same function is going to be

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.544
if we divide the numerator and denominator

00:07:12.544 --> 00:07:13.641
by X plus three,

00:07:13.641 --> 00:07:18.438
it's going to be three times X minus nine

00:07:18.438 --> 00:07:22.377
over six times X minus three

00:07:22.377 --> 00:07:29.361
for X does not equal negative three.

00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:32.037
Notice, this is an identical definition

00:07:32.037 --> 00:07:33.304
to our original function

00:07:33.304 --> 00:07:37.099
and I have to put this
qualifier right over here

00:07:37.099 --> 00:07:38.863
for X does not equal negative three

00:07:38.863 --> 00:07:42.193
because our original function is undefined

00:07:42.193 --> 00:07:44.172
at X equals negative three.

00:07:44.172 --> 00:07:46.891
X equals negative three is
not a part of the domain

00:07:46.891 --> 00:07:48.107
of our original function.

00:07:48.107 --> 00:07:52.514
If we take X plus three
out of the numerator

00:07:52.514 --> 00:07:53.530
and the denominator,

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:55.132
we have to remember that.

00:07:55.132 --> 00:07:56.743
If we just put this right over here,

00:07:56.743 --> 00:07:58.040
this wouldn't be the same function

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.448
because this without
the qualifier is defined

00:08:00.448 --> 00:08:02.503
for X equals negative three

00:08:02.503 --> 00:08:04.454
but we want to have the
exact same function.

00:08:04.454 --> 00:08:07.415
You'd actually have a
point in discontinuity

00:08:07.415 --> 00:08:08.360
right over here

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.807
and now we could think about
the vertical asymptotes.

00:08:10.807 --> 00:08:13.192
Now the vertical asymptotes
going to be a point

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:15.111
that makes the denominator equals zero

00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.062
but not the numerator equals zero.

00:08:17.062 --> 00:08:20.293
X equals negative three
made both equal zero.

00:08:20.293 --> 00:08:23.264
Our vertical asymptote,
I'll do this in green

00:08:23.264 --> 00:08:25.370
just to switch or blue.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:32.704
Our vertical asymptote is going to be

00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:37.122
at X is equal to positive three.

00:08:37.122 --> 00:08:39.246
That's what made the
denominator equal zero

00:08:39.246 --> 00:08:41.826
but not the numerator
so let me write that.

00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:46.146
The vertical asymptote
is X is equal to three.

00:08:46.146 --> 00:08:50.062
Using these two points of information

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:51.401
or I guess what we just figured out.

00:08:51.401 --> 00:08:54.662
You can start to attempt
to sketch the graph,

00:08:54.662 --> 00:08:56.883
this by itself is not going to be enough.

00:08:56.883 --> 00:08:58.669
You might want to also plot a few points

00:08:58.669 --> 00:09:02.124
to see what happens I
guess around the asymptotes

00:09:02.124 --> 00:09:05.617
as we approach the two
different asymptotes

00:09:05.617 --> 00:09:08.495
but if we were to look at a graph.

00:09:08.495 --> 00:09:13.166
Actually let's just do it for fun here

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:15.793
just to complete the
picture for ourselves.

00:09:15.793 --> 00:09:21.135
The function is going to
look something like this

00:09:21.135 --> 00:09:22.428
and I'm not doing it at scales.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:25.439
That's one and this is
1/2 right over here.

00:09:25.439 --> 00:09:32.595
Y equals 1/2 is the horizontal asymptote.

00:09:32.595 --> 00:09:34.642
Y is equal to 1/2

00:09:34.642 --> 00:09:35.888
and we have a vertical asymptote

00:09:35.888 --> 00:09:37.623
that X is equal to positive three.

00:09:38.823 --> 00:09:42.018
We have one, two ...

00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:43.423
I'm going to do that in blue.

00:09:43.423 --> 00:09:47.778
One, two, three, once again
I didn't draw it to scale

00:09:47.778 --> 00:09:50.396
or the X and Y's aren't on the same scale

00:09:50.396 --> 00:09:53.329
but we have a vertical
asymptote just like that.

00:09:53.329 --> 00:09:55.289
Just looking at this we don't know exactly

00:09:55.289 --> 00:09:56.712
what the function looks like.

00:09:56.712 --> 00:09:58.358
It could like something like this

00:09:58.358 --> 00:10:01.611
and maybe does something like that

00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:04.791
or it could do something like that

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:10.136
or it could do something
like that and that

00:10:10.136 --> 00:10:13.808
or something like that and that.

00:10:13.808 --> 00:10:15.481
Hopefully you get the idea here

00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.064
and to figure out what it does,

00:10:17.064 --> 00:10:18.639
you would actually want
to try out some points.

00:10:18.639 --> 00:10:20.647
The other thing we want
to be clear is that

00:10:20.647 --> 00:10:22.347
the function is also not defined

00:10:22.347 --> 00:10:26.271
at X is equal to negative three.

00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:33.502
Let me make X equals negative three here.

00:10:33.502 --> 00:10:37.632
One, two, three, so
the function might look

00:10:37.632 --> 00:10:39.277
and once again I haven't
tried out the points.

00:10:39.277 --> 00:10:40.824
It could look something like this,

00:10:40.824 --> 00:10:44.848
it could look something
where we're not defined

00:10:44.848 --> 00:10:48.428
at negative three

00:10:48.428 --> 00:10:50.154
and then it goes something like this

00:10:50.154 --> 00:10:52.187
and maybe does something like that

00:10:52.187 --> 00:10:59.262
or maybe it does something like that.

00:10:59.262 --> 00:11:01.411
It's not defined at negative three

00:11:01.411 --> 00:11:02.841
and this would be an asymptote right now

00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:03.832
so we get closer and closer

00:11:03.832 --> 00:11:05.677
and it could go something like that

00:11:05.677 --> 00:11:07.429
or it goes something like that.

00:11:07.429 --> 00:11:09.446
Once again, to decide
which of these it is,

00:11:09.446 --> 00:11:12.318
you would actually want
to try out a few values.

00:11:12.318 --> 00:11:14.181
I encourage you to, after this video,

00:11:14.181 --> 00:11:15.325
try that out on yourself

00:11:15.325 --> 00:11:17.046
and try to figure out
what the actual graph

00:11:17.046 --> 00:11:18.631
of this looks like.
