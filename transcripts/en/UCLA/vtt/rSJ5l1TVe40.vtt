The campus Emergency Operations Group is the group of leaders across the

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.010
university that is responsible for
responding to different emergency events.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.590
UCLA is really in every respect a small
city 90,000 folks on campus every day.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.869
The magnitude of potential emergencies
is bigger than most campuses it's a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.980
responsibility to the staff, faculty,
visitors and students of this university

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.830
to have a team like this that's ready to
act. In a situation an emergency or

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.700
almost any time when the campus is not
operating as it normally operates the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.739
CEOG is responsible for providing
resources to the folks in the field who

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.000
are actually handling the emergency. We
activated for the great flood of 2014; For

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.629
the shooting incident of 2016. We actually
responded to a recent brush fire that

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.039
happened adjacent to campus. It was
great to see how our teams interacted

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.489
with each other and how they responded
to that disaster. It's really important

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.410
that we get to know each other. We work
together very well during trainings and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
exercises so that when we have
significant emergencies that affect the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.220
campus we know each other and we work in sync.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.820
We recruit from all over campus. We
recruit from every discipline. Any staff

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.900
or faculty member can join the CEOG. It's really important to have people from all

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.590
over campus participating an emergency
response because we all bring really

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.710
different skills to the table. Being part
of the housing department, because I'm

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.070
part of mass care and shelter, I know a little bit more about sleeping

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.670
accommodations and dining arrangements
so I can bring that knowledge to the

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.800
table and help us provide a better
emergency response.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.960
Probably the most rewarding is actually getting a chance to be activated in the EOC. Understanding

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.010
how big this community is and how many
factors go into an appropriate response

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.810
it's an honor to be part of a team that
helps to reduce injuries and property

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.410
damage and save lives. If you're
interested in joining the CEOG staff then
