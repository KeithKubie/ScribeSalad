00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.460
What will happen?
The Joe Rogan experience,

2
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.060
one of the things I've said about like comments and podcasts and stuff like
that,

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.070
I think one of the reasons why a lot of people get mad,

4
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.770
and I've tried to think this through,
like why some people,

5
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.500
some of the responses so negative to things that don't,

6
00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.270
it seemed innocuous on the outside.

7
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.520
I think it's because it's frustrating when you don't have a say.
Yeah,

8
00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.710
give to people like us.
You and I are talking about something.

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.270
There's probably some guy right now going,
well,
jazz,

10
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.710
fucking stop with all your spiritual bullshit.
Here's what you do.

11
00:00:28.711 --> 00:00:32.520
You'll wake up on your fucking alarm clock goes off.
You never hit snooze.

12
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.300
You get out the door,
you'll put your hours in.
Eventually you get better.

13
00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:37.800
You take care of your family.
Yeah.

14
00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.790
I have like a fucking man and there's probably people like that that are,

15
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.830
they're upset that they feel like we're pontificating too much and this is all

16
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:48.630
just,
you know,
just mental masturbation [inaudible] ways it is.

17
00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:51.660
But that's part of how you solve these things and think these things through.

18
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.730
I believe they deserve their say yes.

19
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.460
<v 1>And that's one of the things that,
you know,</v>

20
00:00:55.461 --> 00:00:59.480
I've been a person that goes to of 12 step support groups is you recognize that

21
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:03.830
everyone's individual experience that is valuable but it's not like that.

22
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.240
And I've got over the idea that you know that there's some external thing can be

23
00:01:08.241 --> 00:01:12.800
imposed and like,
you know,
whilst there are like many people that are,
you know,

24
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.690
we could say not using their 50 years to maximum effect because they are,

25
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.530
you know,
pursuing art material goals.
There are,
you know,
many,

26
00:01:21.531 --> 00:01:25.730
many more people that have never been introduced to the idea of freedom because

27
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:26.660
from the moment they're born,

28
00:01:26.661 --> 00:01:30.080
they're economically tyrannized and told that your only,

29
00:01:30.081 --> 00:01:32.360
if you are not economically valuable to their system,

30
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.520
you are not valuable at all.
And that isn't,
that's only an idea.
But you know,

31
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.550
if you don't,
you know,
if you can't become a lawyer or you know,

32
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:41.750
a comedian or whatever,
fuck you.

33
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.130
<v 0>Well so many of us are trapped in the expectations and values of our parents
too.</v>

34
00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:47.750
But that's a real problem with people.

35
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:51.110
Don't let their children become an individual.
You know,

36
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.800
they force their children to follow their own rigid ideology.

37
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.240
They shame them when they don't.

38
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.260
<v 1>I agree with that.</v>

39
00:01:57.261 --> 00:02:01.610
But do you not imagine that a dick fair degree of that stuff is unconscious?

40
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:06.230
Do you know?
I agree for sure.
Probably unconsciously imposing things on our kids.

41
00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.930
<v 0>100% but not with guilt and women.
If your kid comes to you and say,
Daddy,
no,</v>

42
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.800
I know you wanted me to be a doctor,
but fucking I want to play bongos.

43
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.320
I just want to be the best Bongo player of all time.

44
00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.900
I bet you'd probably be like,
Hey,
learn the fucking Pam.
Those give me a hug.
Yeah,

45
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.080
go get those bongos and become the best damn been Goa you can,

46
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:26.760
there are even mediocre.
Sure.

47
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.120
But there are fathers out there and be like the fuck you are.

48
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:31.530
You're going to be a goddamn doctor.

49
00:02:31.531 --> 00:02:34.740
Stop being a pussy and you're going to go back to medical school and you're

50
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.221
going to pick up,

51
00:02:35.221 --> 00:02:37.920
your studies are going to get you a tutor and you're going to perform.

52
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:42.750
Cause we're a Wilson Wilson and this Wilson family's been physicians so it's

53
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.350
eight tape 20 your brand time immemorial.

54
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.960
The Wilson's have been physician made people bite down on the leather strap

55
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.350
before Amnesia.
He sought off legs and he kept those people alive.

56
00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.310
You want to play Bongos?
You little fuck yeah,
people get mad

57
00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:00.650
<v 1>but my bias is towards my kid like Ah,
like sort of iron.</v>

58
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.300
Like when we was back in England like I was aware of like grandparents or

59
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.090
whatever,
reacting as spiders and stuff going,

60
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.500
Oh spiders is scary and let them fucking teach him that.
Spiders a scary,

61
00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:13.930
I don't want her to think of things is scary.

62
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:16.120
Tell it that this spot is a call there.
All right.

63
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.470
There's nothing you can do like say and you're aware of familial influence like

64
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.300
that.
They wanted the hair to be a certain way.

65
00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.840
They want him to wear certain things.
I want him to like,
yeah,

66
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.910
part of the veganism is like if you make these kids Vegan,

67
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.240
at least now I know wherever they go they're going to be so many restrictions on

68
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.000
their food.
I've not made the kids Vegan.
They eat where the hell they want.

69
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.250
It's up to them either.
Thank you.
Where's my gold stuff?

70
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.740
Where's my ticker tape parade?
Um,
but like,
uh,
so,
but like,
you know,
I,

71
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.890
but I don't know what,
you know,
oh,
we don't know our own biases.

72
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.780
We don't know what,
where we've been institutionalized because how,
you know,

73
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.850
the very nature of their unconscious is we are not aware of it,
you know?

74
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.950
So I suppose in a sense a cook continued open mindedness and willingness to

75
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:01.330
change must be part of any dialogue to go into these situations.
You know,

76
00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.380
I might not actually know what's,
that's why I'm not,
when I was 20,

77
00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.070
if you'd have said about the hunt in art,
be like,
oh no man,
Dah,
Dah,
Dah,
la.

78
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.040
Now I'm like,
yeah,
Jesus,
there's so many ways of seeing the world.

79
00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.370
There's so many ways of looking at what's natural and what's correct.
Um,

80
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.770
you know,
what do I think with hunter

81
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:21.350
<v 0>doing hunting is like many things in that there's no real clean answer.</v>

82
00:04:21.351 --> 00:04:25.670
There's no yes or no good or bad because you can think there is.

83
00:04:25.671 --> 00:04:30.671
But then you find circumstances like wild pigs or invasive species.

84
00:04:30.801 --> 00:04:33.150
Like I,
I go hunting on a place called the nine.

85
00:04:33.151 --> 00:04:34.730
So one of the small islands of Hawaii,

86
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.430
there's somewhere in the neighborhood of 3000 people and 20,000 deer.

87
00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:47.390
It is so overpopulated with deer and they have to kill them.

88
00:04:47.391 --> 00:04:50.030
They killed them every day.
They hire snipers.
They hire people to killing.

89
00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.660
People are slamming it in with their cars.
I mean,
they're fucking everywhere.

90
00:04:53.661 --> 00:04:57.310
And their access deer,
they're not even from there.
They're from,
uh,

91
00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.700
someone brought them over from India to give to King Kamehameha and like the 18

92
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.120
hundreds there.
Their animals actually that evolve to get away from tigers.

93
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.440
So there's this insanely fast,
beautiful deer that are everywhere.

94
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.060
They're forced to kill.
Well,

95
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:14.090
the good news is the people that are a low income people,

96
00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.480
the island always have meat.
There's,
there's meet everywhere.
Everyone can haunt.

97
00:05:17.481 --> 00:05:20.810
It's really easy to find them.
You can,
you can find them.
And if you,
you know,

98
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.130
if you want,
you can go kill him.

99
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.350
<v 1>Yeah.
I've got no moral judgment about that.
You know,
if there's rats in my house,</v>

100
00:05:26.351 --> 00:05:29.380
what,
I'm not going to put down poison.
I'm going to go with as a thing.
Right.

101
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.900
As allowed to flourish.
You should probably feel bad about killing a rat,
right?

102
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.770
As a Vegan.
I do feel bad.
I feel bad about everything.
I'm hungry.
What about my,

103
00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:43.560
yeah,
I would,
I wouldn't swap Musky [inaudible].

104
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.120
Even the Dalai Lama,
even the Dalai Lama low.
I see him.
He went,
uh,

105
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.550
like the first time a general brash,
the second time,
a harder one for time.

106
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:55.210
Smack the Dalai Lama.
The Dalai Lama gives him free chances,

107
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.950
but then you're out.
You might be reincarnated or saying back.

108
00:05:59.951 --> 00:06:02.510
Can I go for the please?
Yeah,
sure,
sure.
Go ahead man.

109
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.290
It's almost three o'clock already.
Do you believe it or not?
Well,
Oh God,

110
00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.700
let me see.

111
00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.770
Like when standing up just made me realize the pressure my bladder was on the,

112
00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:12.750
<v 2>okay.</v>
