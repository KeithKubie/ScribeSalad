Tomlinson: A couple
of the features I like

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.267
about the Android platform

00:00:02.267 --> 00:00:04.400
are the debugging tools
provided,

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.400
especially the DDMS
and the traceview.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.701
Traceview is really helpful
for more technical products,

00:00:09.701 --> 00:00:11.167
so you can track down
which methods

00:00:11.167 --> 00:00:13.601
are actually taking
the most CPU cycles.

00:00:13.601 --> 00:00:16.200
One thing I would like
to request from the Android team

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.601
is being able to inject
lifecycle events

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:21.067
directly into the activity
via Eclipse.

00:00:21.067 --> 00:00:22.334
For example,
it would be really nice

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:24.100
to be able
to pause, resume,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.367
or do any of the other
lifecycle activities

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:27.834
directly from Eclipse.

00:00:27.834 --> 00:00:29.501
It should help us test
our applications

00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:32.601
to make sure they handle all
the activity events gracefully,

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.501
and don't do
any unexpected behavior.
