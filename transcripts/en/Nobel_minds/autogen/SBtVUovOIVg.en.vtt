00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.070
why does nature prefer spherical shapes

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:03.080
why does nature prefer spherical shapes
 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.140
why does nature prefer spherical shapes
well it doesn't always I mean the sea

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.150
well it doesn't always I mean the sea
 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.290
well it doesn't always I mean the sea
tends to be flattish about this for idle

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300
tends to be flattish about this for idle
 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.710
tends to be flattish about this for idle
and and the earth is very large but I

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720
and and the earth is very large but I
 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.679
and and the earth is very large but I
think it's more dependent on what forces

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689
think it's more dependent on what forces
 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019
think it's more dependent on what forces
are involved so if you're on a very

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029
are involved so if you're on a very
 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.300
are involved so if you're on a very
large scale gravitational forces pull

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
large scale gravitational forces pull
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.230
large scale gravitational forces pull
the Sun into a spheroidal structure on

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240
the Sun into a spheroidal structure on
 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.080
the Sun into a spheroidal structure on
the small scale droplets form began what

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090
the small scale droplets form began what
 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.330
the small scale droplets form began what
pulls them being is surface tension

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340
pulls them being is surface tension
 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.459
pulls them being is surface tension
effects so that when that strong a

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469
effects so that when that strong a
 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.200
effects so that when that strong a
sphere is the i guess the has the

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210
sphere is the i guess the has the
 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.580
sphere is the i guess the has the
smaller surface area for given volume so

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590
smaller surface area for given volume so
 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950
smaller surface area for given volume so
that's what is maximized so under those

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960
that's what is maximized so under those
 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.979
that's what is maximized so under those
extremes it becomes a sort of spheroidal

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989
extremes it becomes a sort of spheroidal
 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.840
extremes it becomes a sort of spheroidal
structure in the case of graphite these

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
structure in the case of graphite these
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549
structure in the case of graphite these
are flat sheets but these are locked

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
are flat sheets but these are locked
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.760
are flat sheets but these are locked
into the source of situation they were

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770
into the source of situation they were
 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.219
into the source of situation they were
in the tars from which they were

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229
in the tars from which they were
 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:17.480
in the tars from which they were
produced and so the answer is in those

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490
produced and so the answer is in those
 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.200
produced and so the answer is in those
cases where it does prefer prefer royal

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210
cases where it does prefer prefer royal
 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.679
cases where it does prefer prefer royal
structures and the forces of nature of

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689
structures and the forces of nature of
 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.770
structures and the forces of nature of
surface tension gravitational forces act

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
surface tension gravitational forces act
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.980
surface tension gravitational forces act
two forms here in the case of the son of

course they're pulling inwards that's

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
course they're pulling inwards that's
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.230
course they're pulling inwards that's
the best I can do what's a bad question

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240
the best I can do what's a bad question
 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.689
