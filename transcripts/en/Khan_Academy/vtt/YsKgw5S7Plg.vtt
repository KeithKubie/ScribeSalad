00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.806
We are on number six, which
I will do in this color.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.110
If y is the midpoint of
x, z, which of the

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.190
following must be true?

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:26.130
So if I had a line, x, z, y is
the midpoint of this, right?

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.290
So this length is equal to this
length, because equal

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.650
distance between the two.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:36.770
So the choices they give us,
choice one, they say yz is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.150
equal to 1/2xz.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.370
Let's see, yz is this length,
and xz is this whole length.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.630
And yeah, sure, yz is going to
be 1/2 of the whole length,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.870
because it's the midpoint.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.330
Because this is the same
distance as this distance, so

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.870
this distance will be
1/2 of the whole.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.920
So this is right.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:12.870
Two: 1/2xz is equal to 2xy.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.170
So now they're saying
1/2 of this entire

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.625
distance is equal to xy.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.080
It's not equal to 2xy.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.330
This is wrong.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.380
This would have been right
if there wasn't a 2 here.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.920
If we got rid of this,
then it's right.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.400
Then it's something
similar to this.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.410
Then it would be saying
that this is 1/2

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.930
of the whole thing.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.110
But when you put that 2 here,
it makes it wrong.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.630
xz is actually equal to 2xy,
so that's not right.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.490
So this is not right.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:48.910
And choice three says,
2xy is equal to xz.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.060
And this looks right, because
that's saying this

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.560
distance times 2.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.580
So the times 2 will give us the
whole distance, and the

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.160
whole distance is xz.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.210
The whole distance is xz,
so this is right.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.340
So choices one and three are
correct, and that is choice E.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.120
Next problem, number seven.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:30.030
If 2r is equal to 5s, and 5s
is equal to 6t, what does r

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.650
equal in terms of t?

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.160
And these are easy, because you
don't really have to solve

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.390
for anything.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.490
2r is equal to 5s, 5s is
equal to 6t, so 2r is

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.352
equal to 6t, right?

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:43.770
So 2r is equal to 6t.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.380
2r is equal to something that's
equal to 6t, so 2r is

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:47.262
equal to 6t.

00:02:47.262 --> 00:02:49.090
And they want to know
r in terms of t.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:56.000
So r is equal to-- divide both
sides by 2-- r is equal to 3t,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.250
which is choice C.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.080
Problem eight.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.120
A total of k passengers
went on a bus trip.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.080
Each of the n buses that were
used to transport the

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.640
passengers could seat a maximum
of x passengers.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.875
So n buses, x capacity.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.930
If 1 bus had 3 empty seats-- so
1 had 3 empty seats-- and

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.230
the remaining buses were filled,
which of the following

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.460
represents the relationship
among n, x, and k?

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:45.690
Well, let's think about
what happens.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:53.080
Essentially, we used all of
our capacity except for 3

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.300
seats, right?

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.840
So we could say-- I don't know
how they want to write it, but

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.530
I'll just say what I'll
write-- so the total

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:05.215
passengers traveled-- that's
what they said is k-- is going

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:07.160
to be equal to our
total capacity.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:13.790
Our total capacity is n buses
times x people per bus.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.410
But then we know that there
are 3 empty seats.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.250
We would be done if there
were no empty seats.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.000
Then we would have just said,
well, we had n buses.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.320
Each of them held its entire
capacity, so we

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.080
took n times x people.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.550
We know that there are 3 empty
seats out of all the buses.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.200
There's 1 bus with
3 empty seats.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.150
So we know that there's 3 less
people than the full capacity.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.070
So that's our answer,
k equals nx minus 3.

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.631
And that is choice A.

00:04:42.631 --> 00:04:45.330
It wasn't too bad, huh?

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:46.300
Problem number nine.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.130
Looks like Sal's going to
have to do some drawing.

00:04:53.095 --> 00:04:54.780
I haven't used red
in a long time.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.265
Probably because it's tacky,
but I'll use red.

00:04:57.265 --> 00:05:01.240
So I have this line here.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.710
I have another line that,
at least from the

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:04.750
drawing, looks parallel.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.035
I don't know if it is.

00:05:06.035 --> 00:05:10.446
I know that we can assume that
we have this line that looks

00:05:10.446 --> 00:05:13.220
like it goes in like that.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.160
Almost done.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.490
And then I have a line that
looks something like this.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:27.480
And then the labels are, this
is 80 degrees, and they tell

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:36.880
us that this, right here,
is 50 degrees,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.470
and this is x degrees.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.850
That's all they tell us.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:45.292
And this is line l, this
line m, this is line k.

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:48.510
And they say the figure above
line l is parallel to line m.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.010
Well, OK, so we know-- and they
look parallel too-- What

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.810
is the value of x?

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.250
This is the angle game, if
you've seen the geometry

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.410
videos that I've done.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:04.370
Well, first of all, we can just
figure out corresponding

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.590
angles, or we'll do our
best to figure out

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:09.465
corresponding angles.

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:10.475
So let me ask you a question.

00:06:10.475 --> 00:06:16.640
If this angle is 80 degrees,
what is-- and when I do these

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.950
problems, I literally just try
to figure out all the angles

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.760
in a direction that will
eventually get me to x-- so

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.900
what angles can I figure out?

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.700
Well, if this is 80,
what angle is this?

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.070
Well, these 2 angles are
supplementary, right?

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:31.385
So they add up to 180.

00:06:31.385 --> 00:06:36.740
So this is 80, this is going
to be 100 degrees.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.410
Now, if this angle right here
is 100 degrees, well, then

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:46.760
what is-- well, let's just
keep doing this--

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.010
what is this angle?

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:54.000
Well, they're alternate interior
angles, right?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.430
And if you remember from your
parallel lines in geometry

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.890
class, or if you remember from
the videos on alternate

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:02.560
interior angles, or on the angle
game I've done, we know

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:06.190
that this angle is equal
to this angle.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:09.930
So this angle is also
100 degrees.

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:11.920
And we know that because this
line right here is a

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.720
transversal, and these two
lines are parallel.

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.670
That's how we can make
that assumption.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:20.800
Now, if this is 100, this angle
is 50, what's going to

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.080
be this angle right here?

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.380
Well, once again, we know that
these 3 angles together form

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.990
180, right?

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.340
All 3 combined are
supplementary.

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.140
So if 100, 150-- so these are
150, so this one has to be 30

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:39.040
degrees, because it all
adds up to 180.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.400
I think we're almost there.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:43.840
If this angle is 30 degrees,
what is x?

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.920
What is this angle?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:50.610
Well, this angle and x are also
supplementary, so they

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:54.240
have to add up to 180 degrees.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:57.740
So if this is 30,
then x is 150.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.965
These are supplementary
along this line.

00:08:00.965 --> 00:08:04.980
And so x is 150 degrees,
and that is choice A.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:17.020
Next problem, problem 10.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:26.510
They tell us 3x squared is less
than 3x, and the whole

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.590
thing squared.

00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.679
For what value of x is the
above statement false?

00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:43.250
OK, so the choices are A is
minus 3, B is 0, C is 1/3, D

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:49.950
is 1, and then E is none of
the above, essentially.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.070
OK, so let's see, is it
false for this one?

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:58.430
Minus 3 squared, so it's 3 times
9 is less than-- what's

00:08:58.430 --> 00:09:04.260
3 times minus 3?-- minus 9
squared is less than 81.

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.950
So 27 is less than 81.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:07.410
That's true.

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:12.950
For 0, 3 times 0 squared
is 0, is less than 0

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:14.820
squared, which is 0.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.610
Well, that's not true.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:16.910
0 is less than 0?

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:18.040
Not true.

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:22.596
So this is our choice,
choice B.

00:09:22.596 --> 00:09:25.580
Well, I only have 30 seconds
left, so I'll do number 11 in

00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:26.710
the next video.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.370
I'll see you soon.
