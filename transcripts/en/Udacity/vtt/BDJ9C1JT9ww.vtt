00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[Evans] The answer is not much harder at all.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
All the attacker has to do-- The attacker has compromised the password file.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That contains the line giving the salt for Alice and her encrypted password.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
To break the password, the attacker needs to try possible passwords

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
concatenated with that salt and find one that matches the hash value.

00:00:19.000 --> 99:59:59.000
This seems like the salting doesn't help us at all, but let's change the question a little bit.
