00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.800
The next line of Dimple code we have to replace, is the axis construction code.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.110
In Dimple, this actually happens in two places.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:14.440
First we added a time axis, corresponding to the year of our data,

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.449
which we made the x axis.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.590
We also added a y axis, corresponding to the attendance for that year.

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.200
One subtlety of the X axis that we did in Dimple,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.252
was that by specifying the parse format as only the year, Dimple automatically

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:37.154
aggregated all the games for a given year, and summed up their attendances.

00:00:37.154 --> 00:00:42.030
D3 won't do this for us, but we actually may not want it to.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.810
As we add more context to our visualization, instead of visualizing a single

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.940
year and the total attendance for that year, let's try visualizing every game.
