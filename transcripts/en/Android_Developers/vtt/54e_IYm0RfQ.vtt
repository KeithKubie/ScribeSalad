RETO MEIER: Hi, there.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:08.900
My name is Reto Meier, and I'm
usually joined on the App

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.170
Clinic by Ian Ni-Lewis.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.520
But the preparation for this
week's show required us to do

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.960
some intense physical exercise
in order to properly test

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.020
personal fitness
apps Endomondo,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.870
runtastic, and RunKeeper.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.650
We chose to test these
apps hiking.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.290
Now, back in Australia, we call
hiking "walking," but

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:27.330
folks in California seem to be
more inclined to drive if

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.430
they're going anywhere further
than the nearest car park.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.120
But in any case, the last time
I saw Ian was deep in the

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.380
backwoods of the Big Basin
National Park.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.220
Anyway, find out what features
and technical tips and tricks

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.090
it takes to make a killer
personal fitness app today--

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.270
on "The App Clinic."

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.730
So one of the big benefits of
living in the Bay Area is that

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.830
there's really a limitless
supply of hiking trails all

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.410
within a really short drive.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.165
Now, being a certified
practicing geek, the only

00:01:00.165 --> 00:01:02.240
thing more fun than hiking
through the wilderness is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.260
tracking my route
while doing so.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.090
So all three of today's apps
will let me do that, and a few

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.540
other things as well.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.390
So all three of today's apps
support a standard set of

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.240
functionality, which is
what I've put up here.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.540
Now, they're all designed to
allow you to track a workout.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.280
And in this case, they're
optimized for something

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.160
running related, basically any
exercise which can be measured

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.650
through a combination of the
distance you've traveled and

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.210
the amount of time it's taken.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.670
Now, accordingly, they measure
the duration of your workout

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:30.830
and the distance traveled and
use that to work out things

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.920
like your pace, average speed,
calories burned, water

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.550
consumed, all those
sorts of things.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.840
And they also use the GPS
information that they track

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.710
throughout your workout to
display your route on a map.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.840
And each of the apps shows a
slightly different set of

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.690
details on the map
and, in fact, in

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.040
terms of your workout.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.230
And I'll go through each of
those as we look at the apps

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.030
in a little more detail.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.190
They each also allow you to
select the activity that

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.030
you're doing and choose from
a selection of different

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.500
workouts, so that could be
running, jogging, rowing,

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.020
cycling, push-ups, whatever
you like.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.070
And there's different styles
of workouts as well.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.570
So it could be a one-off,
a time trial versus your

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.620
friends, any number of different
workout styles.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.590
And again, I'll show you what
some of these apps have to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.510
offer as we go through
them in detail.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.320
So taking these features as a
baseline, as a given, this is

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.860
basically what your personal
fitness tracking app needs to

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.930
have in order to
be in the game.

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.830
Let's take a look at some of the
features that can really

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.300
help differentiate those apps
from their competitors.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.250
So this is my wish list of
things that I'd like to see in

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.020
personal fitness apps.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.070
So there's a bunch of stuff on
this list that's totally in

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.790
the nice-to-have territory.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.125
So things like a rich tablet
experience and analytics are

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:43.570
the sort of that can really lift
an app well beyond its

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.230
competitors, well beyond sort of
what you would expect from

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.610
an app, which is really going to
help you win over fans, win

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.420
over users, which are going to
be coming back to your app and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.250
really become addicted to it.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.910
But let's face it, these
features are the sorts of

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.080
things which people aren't going
to notice straightaway.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.490
They're going to require a
certain amount of discovery.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.510
Now, why is that important?

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.330
Well, as it happens, I was
hiking in Rancho San Antonio a

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.480
couple of weeks ago when my wife
asked me if there was a

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.390
way that we could track how far
we were going and how long

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.640
we would be hiking for.

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.390
And I thought, you know what?

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.210
There's probably some apps
to help with that.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:20.310
So I jumped straight on to our
suggestions on the Trello

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.310
board and installed the first
three apps that were there,

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.960
and that is, in fact,
the three apps which

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.740
we're looking at today.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.060
Now, the factors that I used
to decide which app we were

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.670
going to actually keep running
was how quickly it let me get

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.270
started with the confidence that
it was going to record

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.070
everything that I
wanted it to.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.320
So a quick startup and
an intuitive--

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.220
dare I say--

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:42.710
obvious controls were
really critical.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.480
So the overall look and
feel were really

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.250
important here as well.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.490
I opened each app and literally
spent 5 seconds

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.600
looking at each of them before
I chose which one I was going

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.420
to go with.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.940
So that gives you a really
good idea of just how

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.660
important it is to make that
great first impression.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.270
I'm not alone in the way
that I look at my apps.

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.510
People will just download them
and figure, well, which of

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:03.850
these three am I going to use?

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.370
Eh, this one kind of looks like
it's the best, so they're

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.750
going to go with it.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.400
So in the end, for me, I ended
up choosing Endomondo.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.480
So they've got a beautiful
feature page here, which has a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.160
perfectly distinctive icon.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.519
Now, it doesn't necessarily say
too much about the app,

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.300
but it's quite clear that you're
not going to mistake

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.390
that icon for anything else,
anyone else's icon.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.060
And it fits in really nice
into their bigger logo as

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.210
well, so it's a really
good example.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.800
So we really got off onto
the right foot here.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.170
I looked at this and thought
this looks legit.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.180
This looks like an app that
people have spent a little bit

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.430
of time and effort on.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:40.850
So let's jump ahead here.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:43.910
So when you open up the app,
what you get is this really

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.820
well-designed home screen.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.875
It's totally intuitive.

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:49.620
It leaves me with absolutely no
question as to what I need

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.140
to do to get started.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.890
There's a giant green start
button that draws your

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.280
attention straightaway and is
a great example of when and

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.480
how to create custom controls
within your app.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.230
The rest of the app looks
pretty standard.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.950
They've got a clean white
design with a

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:04.870
standard action bar.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.740
And what I really like about
this design is its simplicity.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.170
The layout isn't cluttered.

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.630
You have three pieces of
information about your workout

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.860
visible at any time, along with
the exercise that you're

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.970
planning to do and the workout
style that you're

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.880
planning to engage in.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.840
There's even a hint of
the map poking out

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.330
along the bottom corner.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.980
And if I switch to the giant
phone, I can show you a couple

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:27.700
of other nice features
of the app.

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.290
All right, giant phone,
excellent.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.090
I'm going to switch to the other
side here, because my

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.420
cables aren't long enough.

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.630
So if I fire up Endomondo,
you can see here that--

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.120
we choose not to go Pro.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.350
I didn't install the Pro version
here simply because I

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.630
didn't use the Pro version
when I was using

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.120
the app on the road.

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.350
I'm going to try and unplug
this and put it back in.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.072
Hopefully, it will
stop flickering.

00:05:56.072 --> 00:05:58.860
Or it'll go away entirely,
one of the two.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.110
There we go, still flickering.

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.500
What do you think, Daniel?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.856
Anything we can do here
or just persevere?

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.350
DANIEL: Why don't you persevere
for a second.

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:13.600
I'm going to see if--

00:06:15.756 --> 00:06:19.090
actually, I'm going to go right
over there and try to

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.380
mess with the connection
really quick.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:21.410
Just give me 10 seconds.

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.065
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:06:22.065 --> 00:06:24.050
I'll talk, and I'm going to
stand in front of the giant--

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.100
well, that's going to be
pretty annoying, but

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.160
nonetheless.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.110
What you'll find--

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.600
in fact, if I jump a step back,
that's going to make it

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.660
easier for us.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.870
And if you want to just switch
that off for a second.

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:41.630
So you can see straightaway
that the

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.420
layout isn't clustered.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.500
And what we've got here is,
alongside each of the options

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:48.910
on the screen, you can see
that there's a little

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:51.810
drop-down, which is in fact
going to allow you-- it gives

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:54.440
you a hint that clicking on any
of them is actually going

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:56.090
to do something.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.080
It's going to let you choose
you're options differently.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.380
And this is really useful,
because straightaway it gives

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.120
me hints as to how I'm going to
be able to use this app in

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.570
the right way.

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:08.530
So straightaway, you know that
the clicking on stuff is going

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.260
to give me options
to change things.

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.360
And in fact, that's exactly
how it works.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.570
And so if I click on any of
those options what I get

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.780
straightaway is a list of
alternative things that I can

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:22.910
look at, so whether that be
looking at calories consumed

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:24.320
rather than distance
traveled or any of

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.390
those sorts of options.

00:07:25.390 --> 00:07:27.670
And the same thing goes for
the workout style and the

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.670
workout activity that
I'm planning to do.

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.600
Right away, you're able to
choose, click the drop-down

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.220
and see, oh, actually,
I'm rowing.

00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:38.300
And when I click on those,
I actually get nice, big,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.710
full-screen activities
rather than pop-ups.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:43.140
And this is kind of important
because it makes it really

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.880
simple for me to be able to
make those choices without

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.360
being overly distracted, which
is really, really useful.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.320
And that's really the way
that the whole UI

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.570
design for the app works.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.570
It's really intuitive.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.080
It's really fast
to get started,

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:04.790
which is a real benefit.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.770
So I'm going to spin
this around.

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.740
If we hold it real tight,
it looks like it gets--

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.770
DANIEL: Yeah, I think it's the
movement on the device.

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.020
RETO MEIER: Movement
on the device.

00:08:22.556 --> 00:08:25.175
DANIEL: You know, it's
the issues with MHL.

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:34.929
So are there any Miracast OEMs
out there that are producing

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.480
products which are Miracast
compatible?

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:40.009
Get on it so we can start using
Nexus 4 to do our demos.

00:08:40.009 --> 00:08:40.850
RETO MEIER: Exactly.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:44.130
All right, so that's hugely
disappointing that that's

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:44.830
working out that way.

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:47.540
But nonetheless, I
will continue on.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:49.140
We have do have screenshots
for most of it.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.210
So the other important thing
is that this-- yeah, let's

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:56.340
just kill that because that's
just way too annoying.

00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.420
So again, it's really important
that you're likely

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.590
to be using this app outside
in direct sunlight, when

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:04.140
you're in a hurry.

00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:06.060
So you really don't want to have
to read small text and

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:07.230
hit small touch targets.

00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:09.200
You want everything to
be as simple and

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.590
easy to use as possible.

00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:14.050
And basically, everything
in the app

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:15.650
goes along those lines.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:18.370
It's really simple to use,
really straightforward to be

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.320
able to select different
elements within the

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.130
UI, which is great.

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.560
Wow, it seems that our technical
difficulties have

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:34.190
scared off most people, which
is a shame, but nonetheless.

00:09:34.190 --> 00:09:36.110
So that's basically how
everything goes, and one of

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.090
the nice touches as
well that we had.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:44.090
If I drop back to this screen,
you'll see at the top there is

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:48.160
in fact a little menu item or a
little action item, I should

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.220
say, which is going to allow you
to start a music player.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.650
Now, in this case, it's going
to start up Google Music.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.830
Now, one of the really nice
things about this is that you

00:09:58.830 --> 00:09:59.660
can do this in your app.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.840
And this makes a lot of sense,
because a lot of the times

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.690
when you are going to be using
an app like this, it's going

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.210
to be while you're exercising.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.400
You're going to want
to listen to music.

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:11.240
This is pretty common.

00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:14.070
So having a quick link to a
music player is a really

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:16.100
useful, a really nice touch.

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.000
And you can do this by creating
an intent to launch a

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.230
music player like this.

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.276
Note that it's changed
slightly in Ice Cream

00:10:21.276 --> 00:10:24.980
Sandwich, and you can see both
of the options on screen here.

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.550
Then note that this doesn't
specifically

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.700
launch Google Music.

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.140
The launch intent doesn't
specify a

00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:30.790
particular music player.

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.860
Any app that's capable of
playing, browsing, or

00:10:32.860 --> 00:10:35.810
manipulating music files stored
on the device can

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:38.830
specify the category app music
in its manifest and be

00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:41.990
presented as an option when
this intent is fired.

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:44.090
So if you're building a music
player, that's something you

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.190
may want to consider when
building your app.

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:51.390
Let's take a look at the next
app that I installed, which is

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:53.826
RunKeeper, from FitnessKeeper.

00:10:53.826 --> 00:10:55.720
Now, they've taken the approach
of using their

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.690
feature graphic to display
their app name and logo.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.220
And that's perfectly reasonable,
but it lacks the

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.490
punch of something more
representative of their brand

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:04.430
rather than just the
branding itself.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:10.500
Now, the biggest roadblock for
me was the five touches it

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.880
took to get from my launcher
to the main screen.

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.270
Now, that's a lot of work to do
to get to the point where I

00:11:15.270 --> 00:11:17.990
can decide if I even want
to use the app.

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:20.720
Now, when I did get to the home
screen, I felt a little

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.160
like I'd walked into a time
warp with old-style

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.870
tabs and a title bar.

00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:27.450
Now, in fairness, it turns out
that RunKeeper has a new beta.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:31.460
So I'm going to switch to that,
which hopefully I took a

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.500
screenshot of, but I
apparently didn't.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.610
Now, their new design is
definitely more modern.

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.490
It's very much the
same navigation

00:11:39.490 --> 00:11:40.960
as you can see here.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.560
But they've replaced
the tabs with a

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:45.710
ViewPager-style tab pager.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.710
They've got an action bar.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:49.090
Now, unfortunately, it looks
like a ViewPager, but it

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:49.840
doesn't swipe.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.390
So that's one of the most
important things that they

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.220
need to do to create that
consistency, is make sure that

00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:55.470
they can swipe between tabs.

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.110
And that's kind of the story for
their entire redesign, is

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.350
that it's not really a
change in the app.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:05.150
It's just cosmetic.

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:07.500
So I would definitely suggest
that they take this

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.300
opportunity to rethink some of
the navigation, some of the

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:15.990
structure of the app, as well
as just the raw cosmetics.

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.670
Because at the moment, the
layout and navigation is

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:19.300
pretty much unchanged.

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.380
And in terms of data and
functionality provided on the

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.680
main screen, it's actually
pretty similar to what

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:27.490
Endomondo has with a couple of
really important differences.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:30.490
Now, before I start exercising
there's no indication of what

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:32.100
information I'll get.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:32.990
Will it be mapped?

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:35.980
Will it be recording the
time or distance?

00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.170
I really don't see any of that
before I get started, and that

00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:43.840
really makes me reluctant to
get started in my exercise

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.810
knowing that I really don't know
what's going to happen,

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:48.860
how much of what I want to be
recorded is going to be.

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:52.040
And a lot of users are like
me, and they'll install a

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.910
bunch of options all at once
before jumping in and seeing

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.410
what each has to offer.

00:12:56.410 --> 00:12:59.330
So as a result, it's important
that you give potential users

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.510
as clear a picture of what you
offer without them having to

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:04.391
do anything.

00:13:04.391 --> 00:13:07.290
Now, they've also put a lot of
emphasis on how I'm receiving

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:08.150
my location.

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:10.150
And the input type is the first
thing I'm presented

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.460
with, and 99% of the time
that's going to be GPS,

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.350
probably consolidated with Wi-Fi
and cell ID, if that's

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:17.700
accurate enough.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.630
In practice, for an app like
this, you're going to want to

00:13:19.630 --> 00:13:22.720
listen for every location update
that comes through

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.000
using a patent a lot like this
one, as described in the

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.290
Location Strategies API Guide
section "Maintaining a current

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.340
best estimate." This is going to
let you listen for updates

00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.260
from every location source,
after which you can determine

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:38.490
the most likely current
position.

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:41.320
This is really important for
apps like these, where a few

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.320
small offsets for a few small
seconds can turn a 10-mile

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.060
jog, into a 100-mile odyssey.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:48.000
And you know what I mean.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.660
You've all seen someone's
hilarious social media post

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.362
with a massive spike in distance
where they appear to

00:13:53.362 --> 00:13:56.760
have jogged across a river or up
a mountain range thanks to

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.960
some GPS reflection error.

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.630
So don't be the punchline
to a joke.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.970
Try and sanity check all of your
location results so that

00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:09.040
your users are able to get the
best possible location at any

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.290
given time.

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:14.410
Now, otherwise, the app works
in much the same way.

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:16.400
You hit start, stop.

00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:18.900
One of the strange things is
once you hit stop, you get

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.360
prompted as to whether or not
you want to save your results.

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.530
Now, that should be a given.

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:25.470
You should always save anything
the user does and

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.980
give them an option to delete
something rather than an

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:33.040
option to save it.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.760
The other thing I noticed is
that they have map pins, which

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:39.420
look strikingly similar to the
ones in iOS, which in and of

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.880
itself isn't a problem, except
that it looks a little bit

00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:46.180
weird on an Android device to
have these pins which look

00:14:46.180 --> 00:14:48.570
like they come from a different
operating system.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.680
One good piece of news for
this app, which I really

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.775
liked, is that it does send
everything to a server without

00:14:53.775 --> 00:14:54.820
you having to log in.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:56.290
Now, logging in to the
other apps was

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:58.170
actually a real hassle.

00:14:58.170 --> 00:15:00.710
It took a lot of time and
effort, having to exchange

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.270
credentials, create accounts,
send email addresses, all this

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.930
sort of stuff, whereas here,
it auto-syncs without me

00:15:05.930 --> 00:15:07.430
having to do anything,
which is actually

00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:09.830
a really nice touch.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.890
Now, while I was navigating
around this app, I actually

00:15:11.890 --> 00:15:14.320
noticed a couple of
strange artifacts.

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.930
And one is the way that they
are using a web view to

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:18.210
present a lot of
their screens.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.790
And that in and of itself
is perfectly fine.

00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:22.220
There's no problem with that.

00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.150
But the implementation of the
way that they've done it is

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.770
making the zoom controls become

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.770
visible at various times.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.360
Now, you can make sure that you
turn off both the built-in

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:33.710
zoom controls and the visibility
of the on-screen

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:38.160
zoom, the ability to pinch zoom
as well as the ability to

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.380
zoom using the controls by
turning off the zoom controls.

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:44.290
That should be enough to
make it all go away.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.390
But if you hit both of these
methods here, then that will

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.210
definitely make sure that there
are no ability for the

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:52.830
user to zoom on a display which
you've clearly designed

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:54.660
not to zoom.

00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:59.000
Another strange artifact, is
this modal dialog that tells

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.580
me that my GPS result
is pretty crappy.

00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.480
Now, I don't want to see this
unless it's preventing the app

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.610
from being able to do
what it needs to do.

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.870
So you really don't want to pop
it up unless I've already

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.990
hit the Start button and
definitely not randomly while

00:16:11.990 --> 00:16:14.030
I'm just navigating the app.

00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:16.310
Now, last but certainly
not least, let's

00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:19.690
take a look at runtastic.

00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:23.550
Now, leaving the strange
capitalization choices that

00:16:23.550 --> 00:16:26.340
they've made aside, they've got
a pretty good landing page

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:27.770
on Google Play.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.830
Like Endomondo, they've used
a feature graphic that

00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.560
immediately makes you feel
like you understand the

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:34.030
purpose of the product and the
sorts of people that they're

00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:35.280
marketing towards.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:38.670
And their logo and icon is
pretty good, though I would

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:41.020
really love to see them lose
that rounded rectangle and

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.080
choose a more distinctive
silhouette.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.090
And if you kind of look at it,
you can see that maybe even as

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.500
simple as removing the blue, so
you've just got the running

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.790
man on the black ribbon, would
look kind of awesome and

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.450
definitely distinctive.

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:57.750
So that's something that you
guys may want to consider.

00:16:57.750 --> 00:17:00.870
Now, once we get to the main
screen, we can see that it's

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:04.560
actually pretty similar to
Endomondo, which is great.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:07.720
Clearly, there is a best
practice here, which I think a

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.450
lot of these apps are going
to move towards.

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:12.930
Straightaway, we can see what
we'll be recording, and

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:16.099
there's a big green button to
let me know to get started.

00:17:16.099 --> 00:17:19.200
And as a bonus, runtastic also
displays details like the

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.700
sunrise/sunset time, the current
weather forecast,

00:17:21.700 --> 00:17:25.140
temperature, all of which
is a really nice bonus.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:29.870
And in fact, those extra details
are also included in

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:31.050
my workout data.

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.840
So I can see whether it was
sunny, cloudy, hot, cold as I

00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:35.860
did each workout, which I think
is a really nice touch

00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:37.850
and provides a little
bit more context

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:39.460
for your daily workout.

00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:41.310
And they've included them on
screen here in a way that

00:17:41.310 --> 00:17:45.250
isn't overly intrusive, which
is always a nice touch.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:47.680
So the functionality provided
on the main page is really

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.060
similar, but they've made a
couple of specific design

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.400
choices which I think risks
users falling into the "you're

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.480
holding it wrong" trap,
which is something you

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.530
always want to avoid.

00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:01.810
So the main thing you'll notice
here is that there's no

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:05.190
obvious indication of what
your touch targets are.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.020
And in fact, as soon as I
started touching things on the

00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.160
screen, I tended to
get it wrong.

00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.400
So I'd hit each of
the different--

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:16.070
like duration time things to try
and get pace or calories

00:18:16.070 --> 00:18:19.330
or anything like that and
nothing happened.

00:18:19.330 --> 00:18:22.370
And so it's not until you try
to hit the smallest touch

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:25.430
target on the entire UI, the
tiny cog in the middle, that

00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:26.305
you get that functionality.

00:18:26.305 --> 00:18:28.640
You hit that, and then you're
able to modify them.

00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.600
And again, what that does is
pops up a really, really small

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:36.240
bar of icons, which lets you
choose which of the different

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:37.600
settings that you
want to view.

00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:40.230
So again, it's tiny, tiny touch
targets, which don't

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:41.720
tell you what they are.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.510
And this could be a real
problem, because I'm using

00:18:43.510 --> 00:18:47.010
this app while I'm stretching,
while I'm jogging, preparing

00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.060
to start my exercise regime.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:51.980
You really want to have things
be big, easy to touch, and

00:18:51.980 --> 00:18:54.150
obvious to know what you're
going to touch.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.020
And it's kind of the same thing
here once you get down

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:59.350
to the workout type
and activity type.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:01.550
It's not obvious that
they're buttons.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:03.850
You click on them, and
it pops up a dialogue

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:06.150
with small text in--

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:14.170
closely spaced, and you really
want to make sure that that's

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.930
easy for people to use and easy
for people to navigate.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.000
And it's the same as the
big green Go button.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.350
It's clearly a button,
but it's not

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:21.930
actually an Android button.

00:19:21.930 --> 00:19:25.960
So all these things taken
together really puts you in a

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:28.910
situation where you're having
to think before

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:29.780
you can use the app.

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:31.780
You're having to figure out
how do I get it to do the

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.180
things that I want it to do?

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.100
And for an app like this, where
you want people to be

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:37.190
able to get started quickly
and easily, that

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:38.440
can be a real problem.

00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.650
So once we get going, they've
again made a really

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.480
interesting choice.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.690
And unfortunately, I can't
show it to you right now.

00:19:52.690 --> 00:19:56.300
But once you start your workout,
you actually have to

00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:00.280
unlock the screen before you're
able to do anything.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.310
And in fact, if you don't, so
if you just try and hit the

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:04.750
Pause or Stop button on your
workout, you get a toast that

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:08.500
pops up saying, you're
doing it wrong.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.060
You have to unlock
the screen first.

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.210
Now, I didn't even notice--

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:13.460
excuse me.

00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.810
I didn't even notice that
the first time that I

00:20:16.810 --> 00:20:17.770
went to stop a workout.

00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:20.300
I just hit Stop, turned off the
screen, and when I opened

00:20:20.300 --> 00:20:23.220
up the app later on, I noticed
that it was still going.

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:26.050
Now, a good tip for UX general
is that if you're using a

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.140
toast to tell your users that
they should have done

00:20:28.140 --> 00:20:31.550
something else when they did
what they did, you're probably

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:34.130
the one doing it wrong
rather than them.

00:20:34.130 --> 00:20:36.080
So it's really important to
figure out how users are

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:38.130
actually using your app
and make sure that you

00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:39.020
optimize for that.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:41.190
In this case, they've made the
assumption that the most

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:43.540
likely thing that may happen
is a user will accidentally

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:45.290
stop something on the screen.

00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.840
Now, for most users, chances are
they would just turn the

00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:50.700
screen off when they don't
want to touch anything.

00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.150
So they're better off relying
on the phone than having

00:20:53.150 --> 00:20:54.400
something built into your app.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.670
OK, so once we finish the
workout, the experience is

00:21:01.670 --> 00:21:03.420
pretty great.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:05.200
From this point onwards,
I probably prefer

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.910
runtastic to Endomondo.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.190
The contextual information you
get around things like

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.090
weather, relative speed, the
way that they display your

00:21:14.090 --> 00:21:17.740
speed along your track on
the map is really great.

00:21:17.740 --> 00:21:20.810
There is an option there to
choose between Save and Done

00:21:20.810 --> 00:21:22.010
once you've finished
a workout which is

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:23.050
a little bit confusing.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:25.350
As I said before, saving should
already have happened.

00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:27.070
It should just be a
case of, yes I've

00:21:27.070 --> 00:21:28.530
finished reviewing this.

00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:31.180
Let me go back to
the main screen.

00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.920
Another comment I had is
that their setting

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.580
screen is really complex.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.720
Again, you're sort of in this
pattern of having to really

00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:39.560
read a lot of text to figure out
how to do stuff, which is

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.920
something you should try and
avoid in apps like this.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.640
Now, the next few points apply
to more than just runtastic.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.150
So I want to make sure that
the shame gets applied

00:21:50.150 --> 00:21:52.110
broadly, and the credit where
it's due as well.

00:21:52.110 --> 00:21:54.182
But I think what we're trying
to focus on here on "The App

00:21:54.182 --> 00:21:56.510
Clinic" is ways that you
can improve your app.

00:21:56.510 --> 00:21:57.900
So we're going to try to
highlight a couple of the

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:01.890
things which could be done
perhaps a little bit better.

00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:06.230
Now, first off, both runtastic
and Endomondo have a little

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:08.610
surprise waiting in their
overflow menu.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:12.060
It is, in fact, an
Exit button.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:15.180
Now, those of you who know me
know that my initial reaction

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.110
to seeing an Exit button is
something a lot like this.

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.990
I chose not to destroy
our studio room once

00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:22.190
again to make a point.

00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:25.150
But in fact, you can find my
full thoughts on Exit buttons

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:28.600
in Android apps and why they
shouldn't exist by watching

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.170
Table Flip on YouTube where
I lay out exactly why this

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:36.320
anti-patent fills me with an
impenetrable darkness.

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.360
But in some ways, I
guess I get it.

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.810
These apps represent kind
of a special case.

00:22:40.810 --> 00:22:42.530
They should definitely keep
running while they're in the

00:22:42.530 --> 00:22:43.520
background.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.710
And they all do use
notifications to let us know

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:48.110
that that's exactly
what's happening.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:52.780
So given that, they have two
choices to figure out what the

00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.440
right use case is.

00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.940
Both of them involve getting rid
of something called Exit.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:01.310
They need to decide if they
are more like turn-by-turn

00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:04.080
navigation or if they're more
like a music player.

00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:05.880
Now, for the sake of argument,
I'm going to say that they

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.300
should be more like music
players, which really means

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:11.320
that I only want to see
a notification.

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:13.160
I only want the app to continue
to run in the

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.610
background while I'm
doing the work.

00:23:15.610 --> 00:23:19.440
So as soon as I hit Play or
Start, then by all means, pop

00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.670
up a notification, start an
ongoing service to make sure

00:23:22.670 --> 00:23:24.560
that the app doesn't go away.

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.110
But then as soon as I hit Stop,
as soon as my workout is

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.350
finished, then I want the
app to behave just

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.010
as any other app.

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:33.100
So hitting Home or hitting Back
out of the app should

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.440
take it out of memory, should
stop GPS updates, and just

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:38.470
basically give me my phone back
as though the app was

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.420
never running.

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.980
At the moment, you have this
tendency of like I just opened

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.690
the app, checked it out, and I
have this icon saying or this

00:23:45.690 --> 00:23:49.440
notification saying, hey,
actually, it's still running.

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:51.070
And that's not a great
user experience.

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.260
I don't want to have to figure
out how to make it stop.

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.710
I already did make it stop
by ending my workout.

00:23:57.710 --> 00:24:00.220
While we're talking about
notifications, I think there's

00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.940
really a fantastic opportunity
to make these notifications

00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:04.190
even more useful.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:10.610
Now, at the moment, all three
of the apps have a simple

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.590
"click here to return to the
app" text within the

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.040
notification.

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.210
Now, why not be a little
bit more adventurous?

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:19.220
I'd love to see rich
notifications with actions

00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:21.790
that let me pause or end my
workout directly from the

00:24:21.790 --> 00:24:23.190
notification shade.

00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:26.460
I'd also love to see some more
details on my workout here,

00:24:26.460 --> 00:24:28.700
things like duration,
distance traveled.

00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.250
Basically anything that I've
selected to look at on the app

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.340
home screen, why not stick it
in the notification as well?

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:36.660
I think that really would
present a really rich

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:39.060
experience for your users.

00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.490
And in fact, when we looked at
stopwatch apps just a few

00:24:41.490 --> 00:24:44.290
weeks ago, we saw a few examples
of rich notifications

00:24:44.290 --> 00:24:47.350
being used to great effect,
where you could basically use

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.360
the entire stopwatch app without
actually having to

00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:51.420
launch the app.

00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:52.950
The other thing missing
from all three apps

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:54.130
was a tablet layout.

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:57.240
In fact, only RunKeeper even
supported the option of using

00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:59.260
the app in landscape mode.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.390
Now, I know that these apps were
originally created with

00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:02.490
the thought of having a fitness

00:25:02.490 --> 00:25:04.120
companion on your phone.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.870
I'm sure no one really imagined
strapping a Nexus 7

00:25:06.870 --> 00:25:08.510
to your arm as you go jogging.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:10.352
But what about using
it at the gym or if

00:25:10.352 --> 00:25:11.420
you're using it rowing?

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.640
Then suddenly, a tablet isn't
quite as ridiculous an option.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.470
Now step one is creating a great
responsive design that

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:21.630
means that the app will work
great on whatever device I

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.180
happen to be using no
matter what the

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:25.180
orientation or screen size.

00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:27.350
So that's where I'd start,
really just make sure that I

00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:31.070
can use the app in a way that
doesn't frustrate me on a

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:32.780
tablet device.

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:36.700
Step two is creating a great
tablet-specific experience.

00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:39.890
Now, even if I'm not planning
to take my Nexus 10 rowing,

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.210
I'd love to go through my
workouts while I'm sitting on

00:25:42.210 --> 00:25:44.770
my couch not working out.

00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:47.270
Whether that's reviewing the
tracks I've run, analyzing the

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:50.460
data, sort of doing all that
stuff to figure out what is my

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.090
fitness level, all of that stuff
will be fantastic to do

00:25:54.090 --> 00:25:55.630
directly on a tablet.

00:25:55.630 --> 00:25:57.630
And in fact, that's one of
the things that mint.com

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.710
discovered when they created
an optimized tablet

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:00.720
experience.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.570
It turns out that tablet users
are more deeply engaged and

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:06.610
more likely to spend time
within the app.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:10.580
So Mint responded by creating
a richer experience,

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.940
specifically for tablet users
designed around data analysis

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:14.940
rather than data entry.

00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:17.460
So whereas on the Mint phone
app you'd go through and

00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.030
actually put in all of your
purchases, keep track of your

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:23.840
budget, within the tablet app
you would be able to go

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.030
through and see exactly where
you've been spending money and

00:26:26.030 --> 00:26:27.020
do that deep analysis.

00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:29.110
And I think that there's really
an opportunity for

00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.690
these apps to do something
similar to drive their user

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:33.100
engagement and really
get people

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.350
addicted to their service.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.700
So before we sign off, let's
take a quick look at the

00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:42.220
prescriptions that we have for
each app to help them move

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.220
towards a pure Android
experience.

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.800
So we'll start off
with Endomondo.

00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.280
So first off, kill
the Exit button.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:52.150
It should keep running
only while

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.160
we're tracking a workout.

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:56.200
They've actually got
kind of a bug.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.810
So I made a note to say that
they have an issue with their

00:26:58.810 --> 00:27:02.590
navigation drop-down list on
their homepage, where it

00:27:02.590 --> 00:27:04.890
doesn't have a drop-down icon
to tell you it's a list.

00:27:04.890 --> 00:27:07.960
Now, as it happens, that doesn't
seem to be the case on

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.730
all devices.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.330
So that's just a bug
to take a look at.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.550
Similarly, the settings that
you've got within the

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:17.120
navigation drop-down should be
in the overflow menu rather

00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.510
than within the main activities
navigation.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.190
No tablet view, forced
portrait--

00:27:24.190 --> 00:27:26.120
please don't ever force
portrait mode.

00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.450
I would like to use my tablet in
landscape mode, and as soon

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.350
as you lock it to portrait, I
feel like you're basically

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:34.500
saying you can't use
this app on the

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.470
device that you're using.

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.600
And it's a 7-meg download.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.770
I'm not entirely sure why
it's a 7-meg download.

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:42.280
That seems like a lot for
what the app is doing.

00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.200
So maybe consider what you're
packaging in there and how

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:49.990
many of those assets you need
to have on the device.

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:52.960
In terms of runtastic pro,
10-meg download.

00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:53.620
Seriously?

00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:54.760
Why are these apps so big?

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.350
It feels like you could drop a
lot of that without having to

00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:59.550
lose a lot of the assets
that you're using.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.630
The fact that it takes five
clicks to get to the beginning

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.500
of the app the first time you
run it is a real turn off.

00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.000
Every time I have to click the
button again, I'm that much

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.955
more tempted to just hit Back,
go to the Play Store, and

00:28:10.955 --> 00:28:12.740
download something faster.

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.590
You want to update your
UI a little bit.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:16.810
There's some iPhone-y looking
buttons, which just kind of

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:18.650
look out of place on Android.

00:28:18.650 --> 00:28:19.470
And same--

00:28:19.470 --> 00:28:20.170
Exit button--

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.750
same as Endomondo.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.820
Please get rid of
the Exit button.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:26.800
The setting screen in the
overall UI isn't as intuitive

00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.460
as it could be.

00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:28.430
I mean, it's a great app.

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:30.690
It has a lot of the features
that I really want to see.

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:33.020
It just feels like I have to do
a little bit too much work

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:34.780
to be able to use it.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.580
Build with tablet mode
would be fantastic.

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:40.600
Again, don't lock me into
portrait if you don't have to.

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.510
And yeah, maybe see if you can
do something about the logo.

00:28:42.510 --> 00:28:44.480
I think you're like 90%
of the way there

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.780
with something awesome.

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:47.940
You could just get rid of the
rounded corners, and suddenly,

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.520
you've got something which would
be a really distinctive

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.990
and really great Android logo.

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:54.630
And finally, RunKeeper.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.865
So here, it's great to see that
you guys are doing a UI

00:28:57.865 --> 00:28:59.560
overhaul to bring in
some of those new

00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.130
patents like Action Bar.

00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:03.630
I definitely think it's an
opportunity for you to maybe

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:06.000
look a little bit more deeply
into the structure of the app

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.460
and the navigation, but it's
definitely heading along the

00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:11.640
right path, so keep that up.

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.230
Do get rid of that modal
dialogue for missing location.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.180
That is just death.

00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:18.640
And the menu button of shame,
which is actually a full-blown

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.240
menu button of shame, clicking
it does nothing.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.880
So make sure that that goes away
as part of your redesign.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.330
It also takes like three or four
clicks to go from opening

00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:27.810
the app to being able
to do anything.

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:32.500
So again, try and to speed up
that first user flow from

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:34.610
downloading it from Google Play
and running it the first

00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:39.000
time should be as quick
as possible.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.250
So that's all for us today.

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.370
Apologies for the technical
snafus, which meant we

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.550
couldn't do any of the live
stuff, but I think hopefully

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:48.360
we were able to share most of
the information that we

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.850
intended to.

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:52.470
Don't forget to tune in to
Roman, Nick, and Adam for

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.770
"Android Design in Action"
on Tuesday.

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:57.610
We'll all be setting their
design skills loose on some of

00:29:57.610 --> 00:29:59.950
the apps that we looked
at today, hopefully.

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:01.980
There will be no "App
Clinic" next week.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.310
It's celebrating Turkey
Day here in the US.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.910
And we're going to be spending
some time trying to find and

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:09.860
rescue Ian from the backwoods,
hopefully with a minimum

00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.270
number of his limbs sawn off
with a pocket knife.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.700
When we're back, device
profile apps will

00:30:15.700 --> 00:30:16.550
be up on the table.

00:30:16.550 --> 00:30:19.820
We'll be looking at apps like
Tasker and NFC Task Launcher.

00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:22.030
So if you've got a device
profile app that you'd like us

00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:25.160
to take a look at, be sure
to hit our Trello page at

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:30.320
bit.ly/AppClinicTrello and get
your votes and nominations in.

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.260
I want to quickly throw a
question over to Dan and find

00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:35.850
out if there are any questions
or comments from folks on any

00:30:35.850 --> 00:30:40.465
of the feeds which need
to be responded to.

00:30:40.465 --> 00:30:42.080
DANIEL: So we have
two questions.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.990
The first one is "What's the
best way to integrate social

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:51.350
aspects into these types of
apps?" Go ahead, and I'll ask

00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:52.070
the second one later.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:52.660
RETO MEIER: Sure.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:54.720
That's actually a good question
and something which I

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.370
didn't touch on.

00:30:55.370 --> 00:30:59.300
But at least two of the apps,
Endomondo and runstastic, both

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:03.120
have deep integration with
social features.

00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.280
Now, they've done it
a pretty good way.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:06.000
And you can see that a lot of
people will share their

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.580
workouts via things like
Facebook and Twitter.

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.000
And likewise, Endomondo has the
ability to actually cheer

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.700
your friends on or compete
against them.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.950
I think these are all really
rich uses of social circles.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.520
It's been proven, in fact, that
with things like anything

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.410
goal setting, particularly
things like exercise, having

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:29.310
people hold you accountable is
a really great way of being

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:33.230
able to help motivate you and
keep your willpower up.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.790
So I think the key to social
integration here on a

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:40.270
philosophical level is to
find ways to help you be

00:31:40.270 --> 00:31:43.250
accountable to your friends
and create something

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:46.110
competitive with people, which
is always a real help when it

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:47.850
comes to things fitness.

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:51.030
In terms of practical
implementation details, I

00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:54.840
think the key is really to try
and make it as smooth a path

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:55.490
as possible.

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:58.470
So whatever social network
you're choosing to integrate

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:01.020
with, you want to make sure that
that sign-in flow is as

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:01.950
smooth as possible.

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:04.240
Like I said, I actually had
some trouble creating an

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:06.790
account on Endomondo, and I want
this to be as much of a

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:08.400
one-click process as possible.

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.560
So whether that's signing into
Facebook, Twitter, G+, or

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.680
anything else which provides
you with some of the

00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:17.680
functionality you need, you
really want to try and make

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:19.450
that process as smooth
as possible.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:21.950
And ideally, make sure
it doesn't block.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:24.020
So I want to be able to use
the app with no social

00:32:24.020 --> 00:32:28.370
features and with no account,
and then see the reasons why

00:32:28.370 --> 00:32:31.710
hooking this into my social
network would be beneficial.

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.220
And then once you've done that,
you want to make sure as

00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.950
well you're not doing
anything obnoxious.

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:38.040
Make sure that you always give
the users an option as to

00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:40.320
whether they want to share
something on their social

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.790
network or not.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:45.880
And in fact, one of the apps,
I believe it was runtastic,

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.540
has a share icon, but it doesn't
actually let you share

00:32:48.540 --> 00:32:50.080
anything unless you're
logged in.

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.840
And that's something you
want to avoid as well.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.300
It's great to have the social
features built in directly to

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:58.720
those websites, if you can, just
to lower the friction.

00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.860
But even if I haven't chosen
to sign in with Facebook, I

00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.150
still want to be able to share
it using any of the apps that

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:06.350
I have installed, which may
include things like Facebook,

00:33:06.350 --> 00:33:08.060
Twitter, or G+.

00:33:08.060 --> 00:33:10.910
So you want to make sure that
you don't limit yourself just

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.210
to those tight integrations
and make sure that just

00:33:13.210 --> 00:33:16.930
standard sharing across regular
Android intent-based

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:19.540
sharing works as well.

00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:20.760
DANIEL: Cool.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:24.485
And the last question that we
have is "Have any of the apps

00:33:24.485 --> 00:33:26.810
that we've reviewed on 'The App
Clinic' made it to Pure

00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:27.885
Android yet?"

00:33:27.885 --> 00:33:29.520
RETO MEIER: So good
news on that.

00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:32.780
We have been spending some time
going through the apps

00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:33.960
which we have looked at.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.830
And we have looked at a lot of
apps over the last year.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.390
So it's taken us a bit of time,
but we have I think two

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.450
or three candidates which we're
just going through now

00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:46.410
within the team to make sure
that we're all satisfied with.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.570
And we'll hopefully have
something to announce in the

00:33:48.570 --> 00:33:49.660
week after Thanksgiving.

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:52.320
So not this week, but the week
after, we will hopefully be

00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.945
inducting the first of our apps
into the Pure Android App

00:33:55.945 --> 00:33:58.510
Clinic collection.

00:33:58.510 --> 00:34:00.860
All right, so thank you very
much for watching everyone.

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.390
That's all we've got
time for today.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.726
Join us in a couple of weeks for
the next episode of "The

00:34:05.726 --> 00:34:08.670
App Clinic." Until then, I'm
Reto Meier, and this has been

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:10.200
"The App Clinic." Thank
you for watching.
