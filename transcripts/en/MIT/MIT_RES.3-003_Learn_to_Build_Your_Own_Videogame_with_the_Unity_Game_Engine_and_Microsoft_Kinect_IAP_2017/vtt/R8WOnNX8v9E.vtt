00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.750
KYLE KEANE: All right,
litigious stuff out of the way,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.160
the next thing
I'm going to do is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.960
talk a little bit about
what the class is,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.130
how it's going to be
structured, what you can expect.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.042
Because many of you showed up
here to learn Unity, I imagine.

00:00:32.042 --> 00:00:34.030
And there will be some
learning of Unity.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.850
But also the great
service of coming together

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.100
is to get to know other people
and to work with other people.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.410
So the next two weeks is about
learning some new people's

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.360
names, learning
how to communicate

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.210
with them about the thing
that you want to build,

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.910
working with other
people to come up

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.440
with a collaborative vision.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.410
So it's not just about sitting
and watching a tutorial

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.840
and learning how to do the
technical aspects of things.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.820
We are gathered here
and I feel like we

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.700
should take advantage of that.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.580
Again the, point
of doing this is--

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.120
and it's OK.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.570
I'm sorry.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.010
If you lose three
hours today and you

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.218
decide that you don't want
to be a part of this class

00:01:11.218 --> 00:01:14.170
because I want you guys to talk
too much and stuff like that,

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.220
no hurt feelings.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.090
It's no problem.

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.120
There's video tutorials.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.360
I'll point you to
great resources.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.340
If you want to come
work with other humans,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.890
this is the place to be.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.730
So the next thing I'm
going to talk about

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.540
while Mark emotionally
prepares to start teaching

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.560
is what to expect over
the next two weeks.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:58.402
And so today we are going
to have a brief intro.

00:01:58.402 --> 00:02:00.110
I'm thinking you have
some interest stuff

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.256
you want to go over, right?

00:02:01.256 --> 00:02:01.944
MIKE: Sure.

00:02:01.944 --> 00:02:03.110
KYLE KEANE: Sure, all right.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:09.860
So a brief intro
and then groups.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.570
You're going to get
into small groups.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.150
Now that you have heard some
things about other people,

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.730
I'm going to
encourage you to like

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.860
try to make eye contact
with others at points

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.854
and sit down next to smiley
people and work with them.

00:02:21.854 --> 00:02:23.270
So we're getting
into small groups

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.830
and we're going to go through
the Roll-a-Ball tutorial, which

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.220
is on the Unity website.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.610
But it makes it so much more fun
when you have friends to do it.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.490
So I'll tell you a little bit
more about what you will do.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.330
You'll sit down in a group
of like three or four.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.064
One of you will
volunteer your computer

00:02:42.064 --> 00:02:43.730
to be the one where
you watch the video.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.830
The rest of you will open
up Unity on your computer.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.560
And then you will go
through the tutorial

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.170
together and make sure
everyone has a chance

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.450
to actually like move the
mouse and click on the thing

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.950
and do that.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.440
And you're going
to pause it when

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.565
it feels natural and right.

00:02:58.565 --> 00:03:00.231
And you're going to
challenge each other

00:03:00.231 --> 00:03:01.430
to do small modifications.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.126
Like they're going to have
you put a ball on the screen

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:05.750
and you're going to
say to your friend,

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.550
hey, try to make it blue.

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:09.650
Hey, try to make four balls.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.880
Hey, try to do this.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.850
And you're going to try to make
it a little more interactive

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.321
and fun within a small group.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:18.320
And you're going to do
that for about two hours.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.045
And hopefully it will be fun and
you'll bond and it'll be cute.

00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:23.420
If you end up in a group that
you don't like, no worries.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.090
Tomorrow you'll
form a new group.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.872
So tomorrow you will
have been exposed to--

00:03:31.872 --> 00:03:34.340
and this is the tutorial.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.880
It's so well--made and it's
crafted to teach people Unity

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.460
for the first time.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.340
And then tomorrow
we're going to come in

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.720
and we're going to do
something to make ourselves

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.430
feel a little less shy.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.032
And we're going to
say our names again

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:50.240
so maybe people will feel
more comfortable looking us

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.940
in the eye and connecting.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.820
And then we're going to
talk about something.

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.320
I forget.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.310
There's a 30-minute thing where
am I going to talk to you.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.690
I try not to talk
a lot because I

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.690
believe in learning by
doing rather than learning

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.400
by listening.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.210
So I will talk minimally.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:10.400
And then you will
get into groups

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.680
and start to extend
the Roll-a-Ball.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.240
So I believe a
very effective way

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.120
to learn a new thing--
this class is structured

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.589
for people who don't have any
experience doing anything.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:24.817
So if that feels like you,
you are in the right spot.

00:04:24.817 --> 00:04:26.900
If you feel like you're
way too advanced for this,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.510
then have fun interacting with
other people and teaching.

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.760
Because when you
teach, you learn a lot

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.220
and you get to talk to
people, which is fun.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.720
So tomorrow you'll
extend Roll-a-Ball

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.330
in whatever way seems
appropriate for you

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.090
and your group.

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:57.240
And then Wednesday and Thursday
we'll do some mini projects.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.770
So we'll get into a third
configuration of humans

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:06.150
into groups of three or
four, probably three.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.262
And you'll think of, hey, I
want to do a small type of game.

00:05:11.262 --> 00:05:13.220
And you're probably going
to be crazy ambitious

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.315
and you're going to be
like, in the next two days,

00:05:15.315 --> 00:05:17.190
I'm going to make this
thing for the Hololens

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.356
which allows you to notice
when there's flies flying

00:05:19.356 --> 00:05:21.810
across the room because I
have this backend that does AI

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.976
and you're going to go nuts.

00:05:22.976 --> 00:05:23.970
I hope so.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:26.386
And then you're going to spend
two days trying to build it

00:05:26.386 --> 00:05:28.800
and you're going to be
able to get a screen

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.630
to have a picture on it.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.910
And then you'll be
able to prepare--

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.800
be prepared to make
a bigger project

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.850
and have it scoped properly.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.100
That's my hypothesis.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.870
It works very well
in Arduino and I

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.420
think it's going to work
very well here, too.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:47.700
So Thursday and Friday you'll
have five in-class hours

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:53.160
to work on a small project and
to try to build with a team

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.170
and see if you have
a good team dynamic.

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.540
And if you don't,
know her feelings.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.550
We're going to
break back up, form

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.500
into final groups on Friday.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.320
And from Friday
and next week, you

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.660
will be left alone with
guidance and consultations.

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.180
If you have questions,
we're here to help.

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.240
But you'll be pretty much
left alone in your final group

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.380
to design and build a game.

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.892
So on Friday we'll do some
type of brainstorming activity

00:06:23.892 --> 00:06:26.100
where people who want to
build a certain type of game

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.740
will come up and be like,
hey, hololens, holla lens--

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.130
OK, that's bad.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.660
I'm sorry.

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.290
So, yeah.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:38.873
And so you'll pitch
your idea and then

00:06:38.873 --> 00:06:41.580
you'll break up into groups
and you'll have a week

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.530
to build a game together.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:47.340
And then on Friday
of this next week

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.710
we will have a big
public demo day.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.440
So we're going to have
some systems set up

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.470
with computers that have
Unity on them with a monitor

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.514
and have a Kinect sensor bar.

00:06:58.514 --> 00:07:00.930
Oh, yeah, that's also what
we're going to talk about here.

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.890
We're going to tell
you how to connect

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:07.170
your game to the Kinect.

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:09.900
So if you want to have people
be able to like jump around

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:12.470
in front of your game,
you'll be able to do that.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.310
And, yeah, so we will have four
systems set up with Kinects

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:19.590
and we will invite people
to come play the games

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:21.279
from outside of the world.

00:07:21.279 --> 00:07:23.070
And you will get to
play each other's games

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:24.570
and you'll do little
presentations.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:28.230
And hopefully it will
be a fun experience.

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:29.930
Any questions about that?

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.790
So today you are
having to sit there.

00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:33.570
And I'm sorry.

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:36.210
I go crazy when I have to
sit for more than 30 minutes.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:39.480
I know you're sitting
there very patiently.

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.610
But it won't be like this
for the rest of the week.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:45.120
This is just get to
know each other day.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.300
Yeah, any questions about this?
