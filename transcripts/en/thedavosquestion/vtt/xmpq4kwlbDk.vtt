&gt;&gt; Well, I think China itself is now struggling
for the economic stability

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.370
because what the China produce that we see
is just 30 percent of

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.240
[INAUDIBLE] is 70 percent or more.
But China is a country where the foreign investor

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.320
would like to invest
because of the peace and the security.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.169
And the Chinese are also going out on the
[INAUDIBLE] policy to invest

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:28.240
in their country, so it will contribute to
this what we are debating

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.259
on.
