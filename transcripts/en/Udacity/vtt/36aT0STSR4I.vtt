00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.080
Okay, so now you have an image.

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:02.650
Now what?

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.580
This is where Vagrant comes in.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.420
The tagland for Vagrant is
development environments made easy.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:09.450
And, that's what we want it to have,
right.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.000
Vagrant allows you to create, run and

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.050
connect to development
environments in a very easy way.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.620
We've provided a configuration file for
Vagrant or a Vagrant file.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.770
For convenience it's in
the virtual box directory,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950
where packers saved its artifact.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.850
You just have to register with Vagrant
the artifact that you just created.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:28.260
You can do that with
the Vagrant box add command.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.320
You just specify name parameter.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.400
Which I'm just having
be devops-appserver.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.340
Now that it's successfully added,

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.080
since there's a vagrant
file in this directory.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.900
You can do vagrant up, and
it will bring up the dev environment.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.420
It'll also mount shared folders, so you
can easily use your favorite editor or

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.175
IDE for for development.

00:00:48.175 --> 00:00:50.315
By default, only the host's
current directory share to

00:00:50.315 --> 00:00:51.985
the target/vagrant directory.

00:00:51.985 --> 00:00:54.685
But, we have provided some
additional configuration.

00:00:54.685 --> 00:00:59.415
And once the machine is up,
you can type vagrant ssh to log into it.
