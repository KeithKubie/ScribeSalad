Let's talk a bit more about the Course Forum.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.939
We use Piazza to host our Georgia Tech OMS

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:10.574
course forums. Let's walk through it together. You can

00:00:10.574 --> 00:00:13.210
access your courses from the drop down menu here. On

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:15.806
the left hand side, are posts from your instructors

00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:19.255
and classmates. Instructor posts will be marked with this

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:23.160
little orange-yellow square. Forums are the best place to

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.310
go to meet your fellow classmates, engage in discussion, and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.890
ask questions to the TA and instructor. Feel free to check

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.840
out piazza.com to see demos and tutorials on how to use

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.040
the forum software. For the purposes of this orientation, I'm just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.220
going to quickly walk you through how to create a new post.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.510
All you do is click the New Post button. From here

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.310
you can select the type of post that it is. You

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.280
can choose from a question that you want someone to answer,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.660
a note if you're just sharing or commenting on something, or

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:55.030
even a poll or in class response from your

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.828
peers. You can see that you have the option to

00:00:57.828 --> 00:00:59.916
either post to the entire class, or only to

00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:03.738
the instructors. You can even select which instructors that you

00:01:03.738 --> 00:01:07.070
want to post to. Finally, you can choose a

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.030
folder or tag to include your post in, depending on

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.230
the nature of the post. You'll then enter a one

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.848
line summary of 100 characters or less, that describes what

00:01:17.848 --> 00:01:22.362
the post is about. The one line summaries will

00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:26.210
show up here, in bold, on top of your post.
