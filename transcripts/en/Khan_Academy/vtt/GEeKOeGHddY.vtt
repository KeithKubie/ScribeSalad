00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.800
Multiply and simplify 5
times the cube root of 2x

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.920
squared times 3 times the
cube root of 4x to the fourth.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.250
So the two things that
pop out of my brain right

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.380
here is that we can change
the order a little bit

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.474
because multiplication is
both commutative-- well,

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:16.890
the commutative
property allows us

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.520
to switch the order
for multiplication.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.061
And so we can get
the constant terms.

00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:21.494
We can multiply
the 5 times the 3.

00:00:21.494 --> 00:00:23.160
And then the other
two things that we're

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.540
multiplying-- they're
both the cube root, which

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.330
is the same thing as taking
something to the 1/3 power.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.340
So the cube root of
x-- this is exactly

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.002
the same thing as
raising x to the 1/3.

00:00:34.002 --> 00:00:34.710
So let's do that.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.834
Let's switch the order and
let's rewrite these cube

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:39.820
roots as raising it
to the 1/3 power.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.780
So I have the 5 and the 3.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.580
So that's going to be 5 times 3.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:51.120
And then we have the cube root
of-- do that in a new color.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.820
Then we have the cube
root of 2x squared.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.890
So this I can rewrite as 2x
squared to the 1/3 power.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.630
And then I have the cube
root of 4x to the fourth.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.110
So that's the same thing as 4x
to the fourth to the 1/3 power.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.170
And now we know from
our exponent properties,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.940
if we have two things that are
both raised to the same power

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.670
and then we take
their product, we

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.600
could just take their
product first and then

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.650
raise it to the power.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.740
So if I have a to the x
power times b to the x power,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.080
this is the same thing as
a times b to the x power.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.040
So we can simplify this
part of the expression

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.340
right over here as 2x squared
times 4x to the fourth

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.310
to the 1/3 power.

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.960
And of course, 5 times 3 is 15.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.030
And if we simplify what's in
the expression right over here--

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.350
once again, it's commutative,
so we can swap the order.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.830
And it's associative, and so
we can swap the groupings.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.210
How we group them doesn't
matter because it's

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.680
all multiplication here.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.720
This is 2 times 4, which
is 6, times x squared

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.490
times x to the fourth. x
squared times x to the fourth

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.260
is x to the sixth power.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.840
And it's all of that
to the 1/3 power.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.420
And then that is times
that-- oh, sorry.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.055
Not 6.

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:13.850
2 times 4 is 8.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.390
What am I doing?

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.190
2 times 4 is 8.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.930
x squared times x to the
fourth is x to the sixth.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.800
I think my brain was adding the
exponents and wrote the 6 down.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.654
Of course, 2 times
4 is 8, not 6.

00:02:30.654 --> 00:02:31.695
But we add the exponents.

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:33.800
They have the same base.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.620
x squared times x to the
fourth is x to the sixth.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.650
And we're going to raise
that to the 1/3 power.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.484
And then all of
that is times 15.

00:02:42.484 --> 00:02:44.650
And then we essentially can
use this property again.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.380
Actually, not that property.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.740
We know that this--
well, actually,

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.220
yeah, exactly this
property again.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.420
We have something
multiplied to a power.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.340
This is the exact same thing.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.820
This is the exact same
thing as 8 to the 1/3 power

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.220
times x to the sixth
to the 1/3 power.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.990
And then all of that is
being multiplied by 15.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.560
And so 8 to the
1/3 power-- that's

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.790
the same thing as
the cube root of 8.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.150
You might recognize that
8 is 2 times 2 times 2.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.120
So 8 to the 1/3 power is 2.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.550
8 is 2 to the third.

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.110
So 2 the third to the
1/3 is 2 to the first.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.460
2 times 2 times 2 is 8.

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:28.422
And x to the sixth
to the 1/3 we know

00:03:28.422 --> 00:03:29.630
from our exponent properties.

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.020
That's the same thing as x
to the sixth times 1/3 power,

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.825
or x to the 6
divided by 3 power.

00:03:35.825 --> 00:03:38.900
Or 6 divided by 3
is 2, or x squared.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.780
So that is just x squared.

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.350
So you have 15 times
2, which gives us 30.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.470
So that's these terms
right over here.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.860
And then you have this
term right over here.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.106
I want to do that in
a different color.

00:03:51.106 --> 00:03:52.480
And then you have
this term right

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.630
over-- that's not
a different color.

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:58.690
You have this term right
over here is x squared,

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:59.530
and you are done.

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:01.540
And there's a bunch of
ways you could do it.

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.180
You might not decide to
use exponent notation.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.070
You could say, look,
this is a cube root.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.617
I can then take the cube root
of the product of both of them.

00:04:09.617 --> 00:04:11.200
So you don't have
to write a 1/3 here.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.616
You could just
write the cube root

00:04:12.616 --> 00:04:14.060
of this whole thing over here.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.710
And then, depending on how
you want to group it and all

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.710
the rest, you could do
this in different orders.

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.140
As long as you get the
right exponent properties,

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.940
you should get to
this same answer.
