00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:11.089
Why do humans drink so much milk?

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.218
And given that all mammals lactate,

00:00:13.218 --> 00:00:16.908
why do we favor certain types of milk
over others?

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:18.769
Milk is the first thing we drink,

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.378
and thanks to developments in the 
production and variety of dairy products,

00:00:22.378 --> 00:00:27.990
it can take on countless forms for our
dietary and sensory well-being.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.708
Milk's primary function is as a complete
source of nutrition for newborns.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:36.830
In fact, since it has all of the vital
nutrients for development and growth,

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.645
proteins,

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:38.420
carbohydrates,

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.245
fats,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:40.620
vitamins and minerals,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.709
and water,

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:45.028
milk is the only thing a baby 
even needs to ingest

00:00:45.028 --> 00:00:47.619
for the first six months of life.

00:00:47.619 --> 00:00:51.431
The unique makeup of milk can vary
depending on factors like species,

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.330
diet,

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.888
and location.

00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:56.000
Reindeer of the Arctic Circle, 
for example,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.400
make energy-dense milk 
that's about 20% fat,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.070
roughly five times more than human
or cow's milk,

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.371
to help their young survive the harsh,
freezing climate.

00:01:06.371 --> 00:01:08.240
So how is milk made?

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.010
In the uniquely mammalian process
of lactation,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.111
a special class of milk-secreting cells
known as mammocytes

00:01:15.111 --> 00:01:19.870
line up in a single layer around
pear-shaped alveoli.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.091
Those cells absorb all of the building
blocks of milk,

00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:25.771
then synthesize tiny droplets of fat

00:01:25.771 --> 00:01:29.981
on structures called 
smooth endoplasmic reticula.

00:01:29.981 --> 00:01:33.050
The droplets combine with each other
and other molecules

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.780
and are then expelled and stored
in spaces between cells.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.721
Mammary glands eventually secrete the milk
through the breasts, udders,

00:01:41.721 --> 00:01:47.061
or, in the rare case of the platypus, 
through ducts in the abdomen.

00:01:47.061 --> 00:01:50.342
Although this process is typically
reserved for females,

00:01:50.342 --> 00:01:53.182
in some species, like dayak fruit bats,

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:54.042
goats,

00:01:54.042 --> 00:01:55.322
and even cats,

00:01:55.322 --> 00:01:57.612
males can also lactate.

00:01:57.612 --> 00:02:00.782
Milk drinkers worldwide consume
dairy from buffalo,

00:02:00.782 --> 00:02:01.591
goats,

00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:02.324
sheeps,

00:02:02.324 --> 00:02:03.122
camels,

00:02:03.122 --> 00:02:03.991
yaks,

00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.782
horses,

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:06.421
and cows.

00:02:06.421 --> 00:02:09.122
Almost all of these species are ruminants,

00:02:09.122 --> 00:02:12.212
a type of mammal with 
four-chambered stomachs

00:02:12.212 --> 00:02:14.901
that yield large quantities of milk.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:17.934
Of these, cows were the most 
easily domesticated

00:02:17.934 --> 00:02:21.696
and produce a milk that is both
easily separated into cream and liquid

00:02:21.696 --> 00:02:25.335
and has a similar fat content
to human milk.

00:02:25.335 --> 00:02:26.782
In their natural environment,

00:02:26.782 --> 00:02:31.303
mammals secrete milk on call 
for immediate consumption by their young.

00:02:31.303 --> 00:02:33.852
But with the demands of thirsty consumers,

00:02:33.852 --> 00:02:37.656
the dairy industry has enlisted methods
to step up production,

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:39.003
enhance shelf life,

00:02:39.003 --> 00:02:42.564
and provide a variety of milk products.

00:02:42.564 --> 00:02:46.873
In the dairy, centrifugation machines
spin milk at high speeds,

00:02:46.873 --> 00:02:51.822
forcing less dense fats to separate
from the liquid and float up.

00:02:51.822 --> 00:02:53.173
After being skimmed off,

00:02:53.173 --> 00:02:56.932
this fat, known as butterfat,
can be used in dairy products

00:02:56.932 --> 00:02:57.673
like butter,

00:02:57.673 --> 00:02:58.414
cream,

00:02:58.414 --> 00:02:59.514
and cheese.

00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:03.743
Or it can be later added back to 
the liquid in varying proportions

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:06.313
to yield different fat content milks.

00:03:06.313 --> 00:03:13.544
Full fat milk, sometimes referred to
as whole milk, has 3.25% butterfat added

00:03:13.544 --> 00:03:17.895
compared to 1-2% for low
and reduced fat milk,

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:20.864
and less than half a percent 
for skim milk.

00:03:20.864 --> 00:03:24.754
To stop reseparation of the fat
from the water, or creaming,

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:29.894
the mixture undergoes the high-energy
pressurized process of homogenization.

00:03:29.894 --> 00:03:34.204
Before milk hits the shelves, it's also
typically heat treated

00:03:34.204 --> 00:03:36.155
to reduce its level of microbes,

00:03:36.155 --> 00:03:37.665
a government-sanctioned process

00:03:37.665 --> 00:03:42.384
that raw milk enthusiasts argue 
may reduce milk's nutritional worth.

00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:45.605
Milk spoilage is started by microbes,

00:03:45.605 --> 00:03:48.995
which consume and break down 
the nutrients in milk.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:52.395
That process causes butterfat 
to clump together,

00:03:52.395 --> 00:03:55.735
leading to a visually unpleasant product.

00:03:55.735 --> 00:03:57.994
And the byproducts of 
the microbes' consumption

00:03:57.994 --> 00:04:01.835
are compounds that taste 
and smell nasty.

00:04:01.835 --> 00:04:03.230
But there's a bigger problem.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.005
Raw milk can carry microbes that are
the sources of deadly diseases,

00:04:08.005 --> 00:04:11.566
so in order to kill as many of those
microbes as possible,

00:04:11.566 --> 00:04:13.476
and keep milk fresh longer,

00:04:13.476 --> 00:04:16.669
we use a technique called pasteurization.

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:19.495
One version of this process involves
exposing milk

00:04:19.495 --> 00:04:22.155
to about 30 seconds of high heat.

00:04:22.155 --> 00:04:25.595
Another version, 
called ultra-high temperature processing,

00:04:25.595 --> 00:04:27.376
or ultra pasteurization,

00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:33.036
blasts the milk with considerably higher 
temperatures over just a few seconds.

00:04:33.036 --> 00:04:36.326
UHT milk boasts a much longer shelf life,

00:04:36.326 --> 00:04:38.626
up to twelve months unrefrigerated,

00:04:38.626 --> 00:04:42.226
compared to pasteurized milk's
two weeks in the fridge.

00:04:42.226 --> 00:04:45.087
That's because the higher temperatures
of UHT processing

00:04:45.087 --> 00:04:47.647
inactivate far more microbes.

00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:50.058
Yet the higher processing temperatures

00:04:50.058 --> 00:04:54.832
may adversely affect the nutritional
and sensory properties of the milk.

00:04:54.832 --> 00:04:57.907
Ultimately, that choice lies
in the consumer's taste

00:04:57.907 --> 00:04:59.688
and need for convenience.

00:04:59.688 --> 00:05:02.067
Fortunately, there are many 
choices available

00:05:02.067 --> 00:05:08.308
in an industry that produces in excess 
of 840 million tons of products each year.
