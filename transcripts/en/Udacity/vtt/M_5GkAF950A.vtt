00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.620
So let's look at the drawbacks of

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.250
the simple implementation of sequential consistency. Remember

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.990
that that simple implementation basically issues the

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.750
next access only when all prior accesses

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.260
are complete. So if you have out of order cores, what is the memory

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.550
level parallelism we get on each core by doing this? Put that number here.
