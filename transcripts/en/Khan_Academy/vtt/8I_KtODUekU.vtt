00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:02.512
- [Voiceover] In the last video we saw

00:00:02.512 --> 00:00:04.151
that if we have an infinite series

00:00:04.151 --> 00:00:06.052
where each term is a function of N,

00:00:06.052 --> 00:00:08.816
and the function itself
is a continuous, positive,

00:00:08.816 --> 00:00:13.299
decreasing function over
the intervals we care about,

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:15.817
and we assume that this series converges,

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:19.359
then we can estimate that series,

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.385
we can estimate the value
that it converges to,

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:26.250
using a finite number of
terms and some integrals,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.685
and the way that we
establish these integrals

00:00:27.685 --> 00:00:31.401
is because when we split
up the sum into finite sum

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.886
and then another infinite series,

00:00:32.886 --> 00:00:34.517
we're about to conceptualize that

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:36.435
infinite series in two different ways.

00:00:36.435 --> 00:00:38.996
It could be an underestimate of

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.267
this integral right over here,

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.250
or it could be an overestimate of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.768
this integral right over here,

00:00:44.768 --> 00:00:46.668
and because of that it
allows us to not only

00:00:46.668 --> 00:00:49.518
estimate S but to put bounds on it.

00:00:49.518 --> 00:00:51.134
If we can evaluate the left hand side here

00:00:51.134 --> 00:00:53.851
and the right hand side here
for a given infinite series,

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.317
then we can establish our bounds on S,

00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:58.565
so let's see how good these are by

00:00:58.565 --> 00:01:01.985
applying it to a
particular infinite series.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.018
So let's say that the infinite series

00:01:05.018 --> 00:01:08.851
we want to apply it to, let
me do it in the yellow color,

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:11.967
so it's going to be, let's say,

00:01:11.967 --> 00:01:15.851
we go from N equals one to
infinity of one over N squared,

00:01:15.851 --> 00:01:16.934
and let's say we didn't know how

00:01:16.934 --> 00:01:17.884
to find the exact value here,

00:01:17.884 --> 00:01:18.950
but we want to estimate it.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.950
Let's say we want to estimate
it using the first five terms,

00:01:25.635 --> 00:01:29.918
so we'll do S sub five is equal to the sum

00:01:30.994 --> 00:01:35.994
of N equals one to infinity,

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:41.895
sorry, to five of one over n squared,

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:45.924
and let's see, this is
going to be equal to,

00:01:45.924 --> 00:01:48.617
let's get a calculator
out, this is going to be

00:01:48.617 --> 00:01:49.902
one over one squared, which is just one,

00:01:49.902 --> 00:01:52.031
plus one over two squared,
which is one fourth,

00:01:52.031 --> 00:01:55.916
plus one over three
squared, which is one ninth,

00:01:55.916 --> 00:01:59.054
plus one over four
squared, which is one 16th,

00:01:59.823 --> 00:02:03.919
plus one over five squared,
which is going to be one 25th,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.884
and we get this value right over here,

00:02:09.884 --> 00:02:12.285
so I'll just say this is, I'll say it's

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:14.650
approximately, one point four six four.

00:02:15.217 --> 00:02:18.469
Approximately one point four six four,

00:02:18.718 --> 00:02:21.617
and then if we evaluate
each of these integrals,

00:02:21.617 --> 00:02:25.584
so our K in this case is going to be five.

00:02:25.584 --> 00:02:26.751
I just picked that arbitrarily.

00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:28.701
We could probably get a better,
or we would get a better

00:02:28.701 --> 00:02:31.619
estimate if we had a higher K,
if we did the first 10 terms

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:34.118
or 20 terms, and we would
have a worse estimate

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:36.369
if we did K equals three, but
I just picked K equals five

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:38.560
because it seems reasonable,
something that I could compute.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.001
I actually didn't need
a calculator to do that.

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.084
I could have done it by hand.

00:02:41.084 --> 00:02:42.368
It would have just taken more time.

00:02:42.368 --> 00:02:44.342
Let's evaluate these integrals here.

00:02:44.788 --> 00:02:47.834
So the integral from five plus one,

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:52.834
so it's six to infinity
of one over N squared DX,

00:02:54.623 --> 00:02:58.447
and, let's see, that's
going to be equal to,

00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:01.947
let's write it this way, this
is going to be the limit,

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:04.398
I'll do all of it in blue actually.

00:03:04.398 --> 00:03:08.679
This is going to be equal to the limit as,

00:03:10.863 --> 00:03:13.781
let's introduce a new
variable, B approaches infinity

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:17.029
of the integral from six to

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:20.634
infinity of one over N squared DX,

00:03:20.634 --> 00:03:25.634
which is equal to the limit
as B approaches infinity of,

00:03:29.242 --> 00:03:30.535
let's see, the antiderivative of this

00:03:30.535 --> 00:03:35.103
is negative N to the negative one,

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:38.686
and we're going to evaluate
that at B and at six,

00:03:38.686 --> 00:03:43.035
so this is equal to the
limit as B approaches

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.086
infinity of negative one over B,

00:03:46.086 --> 00:03:49.352
negative one over B minus negative one

00:03:49.352 --> 00:03:52.734
over six, so plus one over six.

00:03:53.395 --> 00:03:54.237
Well as B approaches infinity

00:03:54.237 --> 00:03:56.103
this term right over here goes to zero,

00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:58.870
so this is just going to
be equal to one sixth,

00:03:59.236 --> 00:04:01.187
and we can use that exact same logic

00:04:01.187 --> 00:04:04.486
to evaluate this integral,
so let's do that.

00:04:05.084 --> 00:04:07.088
Actually, I'll do it right over here.

00:04:07.088 --> 00:04:10.019
So the improper integral,
I should say, from,

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.302
and here we're going to evaluate not

00:04:11.302 --> 00:04:13.237
from six but from five, that's our K.

00:04:13.237 --> 00:04:17.736
Five to infinity of one over N squared DX.

00:04:17.736 --> 00:04:19.604
Well, the only difference here between

00:04:19.604 --> 00:04:21.968
these two integrals is this bottom bound.

00:04:21.968 --> 00:04:23.104
This was one over six,

00:04:23.104 --> 00:04:24.104
and by the same arugemnts,

00:04:24.104 --> 00:04:29.104
this one is going to end
up being one over five.

00:04:30.964 --> 00:04:32.354
And so now we can put everything

00:04:32.354 --> 00:04:34.214
into this compound inequality.

00:04:34.214 --> 00:04:37.701
We're going to have one
point four six four.

00:04:37.701 --> 00:04:42.432
One point one six four plus,
and I'm being a little bit

00:04:42.432 --> 00:04:44.764
approximate here, it's
really this S sub K,

00:04:44.764 --> 00:04:47.081
which we have the exact
value for in our calculator,

00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:51.181
so it's one point four
six four plus one sixth,

00:04:51.873 --> 00:04:56.314
plus one sixth, is less than or equal to,

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:00.347
less than or equal to,
is less than or equal to

00:05:00.347 --> 00:05:05.347
our sum, which we care about,
which is less than or equal to

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:10.465
one point four six four plus
one fifth, plus one fifth,

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.264
and so this one is fairly
straight forward to calculate.

00:05:17.264 --> 00:05:19.082
This is going to be plus point two,

00:05:19.082 --> 00:05:20.946
so this is going to be less than

00:05:20.946 --> 00:05:25.946
or equal to one point two six four,

00:05:27.164 --> 00:05:30.082
so sum is going to be less
than or equal to that,

00:05:30.082 --> 00:05:34.847
and on this side if we took
our original expression,

00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:38.762
and then I added one sixth, one sixth,

00:05:38.762 --> 00:05:43.132
I get one point...I get
one...let's see, what did I?

00:05:43.132 --> 00:05:44.449
Oh, this is supposed to be one...

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:45.831
I wrote this one wrong.

00:05:45.831 --> 00:05:49.383
O.K., so this is going to
be one point sixth three oh.

00:05:49.597 --> 00:05:50.782
Let me just write one point...

00:05:50.782 --> 00:05:55.315
So it's going to be
one point six three oh,

00:05:55.315 --> 00:05:58.848
and on this side, my
brain was malfunctioning.

00:05:59.346 --> 00:06:02.024
This should be one point one,

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.581
I took away two instead of adding two,

00:06:03.581 --> 00:06:08.581
one point six six four,
one point six six four,

00:06:09.365 --> 00:06:10.416
and so just like that you see,

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:15.416
O.K., this thing must be like
one point six three something.

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.606
It could be one point four something.

00:06:18.606 --> 00:06:20.022
It could be one point five something.

00:06:20.022 --> 00:06:22.250
It could be one point six six,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:24.183
but this is already giving
us a lot of precision,

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:26.184
if we only cared about
things to the 10ths place,

00:06:26.184 --> 00:06:27.702
this kind of, we're done.

00:06:27.702 --> 00:06:29.800
We know it's going to be
one point six something,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.884
and if we go a little bit further

00:06:31.884 --> 00:06:33.401
this is already giving
us a lot of precision,

00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:35.534
and you can imagine if
you added a few more terms

00:06:35.534 --> 00:06:39.066
in the partial sum, you would
get even more precision.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.485
So hopefully you found this
to be kind of neat exercise.

00:06:41.485 --> 00:06:43.466
Not only did we get a
good bit of precision,

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:47.134
a good bit of precision with
just taking a partial sum

00:06:47.134 --> 00:06:48.617
and the help of these integrals,

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.161
but we got a good bound on it.

00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:52.267
We know that the sum
that we're converging to

00:06:52.267 --> 00:06:55.322
is between these two values.
