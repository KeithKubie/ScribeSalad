00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.751
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:04.750
SUE BLACK: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.090
Thanks very much for
inviting me along here today.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.130
I think you now know almost
everything about me, apart

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.254
from what I'm going
to tell you now.

00:00:12.254 --> 00:00:13.670
That was a great
talk from Dermot.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.460
And it was really lovely
for me, because I've

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.710
known Dermot for some time,
because of our involvement

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.090
with Bletchley Park, to
actually hear your talk, Dermot.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.400
That was really cool.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.440
So I suppose I first got
involved with Bletchley Park,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.250
I first went up there in 2003.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.640
So at the time, I was
I think a PhD student,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.570
and I'd set up a network
for women in tech, BCSWomen.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.570
And I went up there
for a meeting.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.760
I didn't really know very
much about Bletchley Park.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.160
I think all I knew then really--
well in fact, what I thought

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.940
I knew wasn't correct-- was
that there were probably

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.270
about 50 old guys
that worked there.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.330
And I just kind of
imagined them sitting

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.510
around code breaking,
kind of smoking pipes,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.790
wearing tweed jackets, and
maybe doing the Times crossword

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:57.370
on the side.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.912
And that's kind
of how I thought--

00:00:58.912 --> 00:01:01.120
that's what I thought was
happening at Bletchley Park

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.910
the first time I went there.

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.629
So I went there for a meeting.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.640
And after the meeting, I went
for a walk around the site

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.830
and ended up bumping
into these guys who

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.290
were building this amazing kind
of like feat of engineering

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.020
in the corner of
one of the huts.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.520
And I went over and
chatted to them,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.186
and found out that actually that
was Turing's Bombe machine they

00:01:21.186 --> 00:01:21.870
were rebuilding.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.120
They were about halfway
through it at the time.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.976
I started chatting to the guys
about what they were doing,

00:01:26.976 --> 00:01:28.600
and then they asked
me why I was there.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.641
So I said I'm here
representing this group, Women

00:01:30.641 --> 00:01:31.570
in Technology.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.500
And John Harper, the guy that
was leading the team said, oh,

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.000
did you know that more than
half the people that worked here

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.540
were women?

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.470
So I said no, I didn't
know any women worked here.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.710
How many people worked here?

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.650
So he said more than 10,000.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.050
So I was like completely
blown away by that, A,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.670
because 10,000 people, and I
thought it was 50 old guys.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.530
And B, because more than half
of those people were women.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.190
So I went away that
time really wanting

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.350
to raise awareness of the women
that worked at Bletchley Park.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.945
And eventually,
after some time, I

00:02:02.945 --> 00:02:06.090
managed to raise some funding
to run an oral history project.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.340
So we interviewed some of
the women that worked there,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.756
because I really
wanted to capture

00:02:09.756 --> 00:02:11.710
their memories
because, of course,

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:13.370
they weren't spring chickens.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.790
They were getting on
a bit, unfortunately.

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.650
And I was really
worried that everyone

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.900
that knew what happened
there would die before we

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.300
got a chance to interview them.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.300
I forgot to put
my slides forward.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.965
So this is the BCSWomen
Group here in 2002.

00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.350
So it was about
a year after this

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:35.400
that I went up to Bletchley
Park representing them.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.990
And so here are
some of the women

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.240
that worked at Bletchley Park.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.570
And two of the women
that we interviewed,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.430
Ruth Bourne and Jean
Valentine, are standing here

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.760
with the Bombe machine.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.490
So they were Bombe operators.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:52.200
So we ran this oral
history projec.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.510
And at the launch of
that, at the BCS--

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.942
the British Computer
Society in London--

00:02:58.942 --> 00:03:00.400
I gave a talk
saying, you know, why

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.830
I thought we needed to record
the women's memories, the women

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:05.790
that worked there.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.580
And then Simon Greenish, who was
then the CEO of Bletchley Park,

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.620
gave a talk.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.270
And he said that he was
really worried that Bletchley

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:15.790
Park might have to close.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.380
So at the time, he was
worried that-- everyone

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.270
was talking about a
swine flu epidemic,

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:22.160
and he was really
worried that the visitor

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.770
numbers might drop if there
was a swine flu epidemic.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.080
And the main money that
Bletchley Park had then, too,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.300
came from gate receipts,
so from people visiting.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.800
He was really worried that if
the numbers of people visiting

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.100
dropped, the income coming
into Bletchley Park would drop

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.560
and so they'd have to close.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.660
So he told us about
that, and he said

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.430
that he thought that
Bletchley Park was--

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.130
his words were "teetering
on a financial knife edge."

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:51.280
So I kind of-- after that day, I
was kind of worried about that.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.680
I thought that was wrong.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.460
But then I got invited up to
a reception at Bletchley Park

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.261
a couple of months later
and did a proper tour,

00:03:58.261 --> 00:04:00.510
which I had not done before,
with one of the veterans.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.926
I got to hear much more about
what happened there, and was

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:05.030
told that the work
done at Bletchley Park

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.060
was said to have shortened
the war by two years,

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.590
and that 11 million
people a year

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.194
were dying during World War II.

00:04:10.194 --> 00:04:11.610
And I just had
this moment where I

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.310
was standing looking at this hut
with a blue tarpaulin listening

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:19.038
to a veteran who
worked there telling us

00:04:19.038 --> 00:04:21.579
about the major code breaking
achievements at Bletchley Park.

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.370
And I just stood there
thinking, and this place

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.220
might have to close?

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.410
That's terrible.

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.825
So I went away and basically
started a campaign to save it.

00:04:32.825 --> 00:04:34.700
By that time-- so this
is a few years later--

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.850
I was then head of department at
the University of Westminster,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.780
head of a computer
science department.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.953
So I just thought to
myself, what can I do?

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:46.920
You know, Bletchley
Park can't close.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.174
Just the-- all the
stuff that happened

00:04:49.174 --> 00:04:50.840
there is just really
incredible, and not

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.456
enough people know about it.

00:04:52.456 --> 00:04:54.080
And so I was kind of
trying to work out

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.510
what I could do about it.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.990
Then I saw that
there was someone

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:01.280
who had set up a petition on
the 10 Downing Street website

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.040
saying the government needs
to save Bletchley Park.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.232
So I found the link to that.

00:05:06.232 --> 00:05:08.440
I sent it round to all the
other heads and professors

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.290
of computer science
in the country,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.240
because we were all
on an email list,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.540
asking them to
sign the petition.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.410
I sent a photo of the hut
with the blue tarpaulin

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.750
and said that the work that
was done there shortened

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.360
the war by two years, and
11 million people a year

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.750
were said to have been
dying, and asked everyone--

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.958
or asked all the heads and
professors across the UK--

00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:30.640
to sign the petition.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.050
And then I looked at the
petition-- so in those days,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.510
you could see who'd
signed the petition.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.301
I looked at the petition
a few hours later,

00:05:36.301 --> 00:05:38.545
and was amazed to find
that the people that

00:05:38.545 --> 00:05:40.130
had written the
textbooks for me when

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.500
I was a student of
computing at university, I

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.260
recognized lots of
the names of really

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.650
famous professors of
computing from around the UK.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.010
So I got very excited
then because I just

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:52.980
thought, OK, it's not
just me that thinks this.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.854
All these people that
I think, oh my god, I'm

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:59.350
not worthy to even contact
them, had signed it as well.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.360
So that kind of gave me the
confidence to move forward.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.250
So that was very cool.

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:08.187
I decided to set up a
blog and try and raise

00:06:08.187 --> 00:06:10.020
awareness of what
happened at Bletchley Park

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.580
and how important it was.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.027
So here's my blog here.

00:06:15.027 --> 00:06:16.110
Looks very old school now.

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.400
It's quite funny-looking a bit.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.780
So that was about 2008.

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:23.050
And then I was just
trying to work out well,

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.110
what else can we do?

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:26.460
So all these people who
are professors of computing

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.680
care about this as much as I do.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.260
What can I do about that?

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:36.340
So basically, I emailed
all the journalists

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.030
that I knew and said, I
think this is a story.

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.709
We need to save Bletchley Park.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:42.250
And luckily, one of
those journalists

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:44.440
was Rory Cellan-Jones
from the BBC.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.890
And so the next week after that,
he took me up to Bletchley Park

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:49.770
and filmed me there
and got that out

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.482
on BBC News and Today Program.

00:06:52.482 --> 00:06:54.940
And that went worldwide, which
was a bit of a shock for me,

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.220
because I wasn't really used
to being in the media when

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.210
suddenly-- you know, like
one week I'm just, like,

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.740
a normal head of
department at university.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.150
And the next week, I have
friends in Australia saying,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.630
I just saw you on
TV, like BBC America.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.810
So it was a bit of a
shock, but it was good.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:14.675
And I got to do my first
live TV, which is very scary.

00:07:14.675 --> 00:07:16.800
And I actually-- I remember
sitting there thinking,

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.830
if only I could just have
a heart attack and die.

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.029
I would prefer that to going
on live TV, like News at One

00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.820
or whatever it was.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.390
But unfortunately, I didn't die.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.785
Or fortunately.

00:07:27.785 --> 00:07:29.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:34.431
So yeah, it was a great
learning experience for me.

00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:35.180
So that was great.

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.310
The message got out there.

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:38.050
Lots of people got
in touch by email.

00:07:38.050 --> 00:07:41.512
But then like a week later, two
weeks later, three weeks later,

00:07:41.512 --> 00:07:42.470
what was I going to do?

00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:43.610
I couldn't go back
to the news, right?

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.240
I couldn't go back and
say it's a new story,

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.448
because it's not a new story.

00:07:46.448 --> 00:07:48.990
So news needs to be new.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.570
So I was casting
around for some time

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.300
trying to work out what to do.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
And then a few months
later, I started

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.190
using Twitter in earnest really.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.190
I'd signed up before and
thought it was rubbish,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:00.220
and then just kind of left it.

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.678
And then I ended
up at a conference

00:08:01.678 --> 00:08:03.750
sitting next to people
that loved Twitter.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.240
And so it was like
the end of 2008.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.040
And I suddenly realized
actually Twitter

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.060
could be a way of really getting
out there, finding people that

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.930
care about Bletchley
Park, and kind of creating

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:18.895
a community of people that cared
about Bletchley Park and kind

00:08:18.895 --> 00:08:20.270
of work together
to try and raise

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.764
the profile of Bletchley Park.

00:08:22.764 --> 00:08:27.235
So through Twitter, I
didn't really tweet much

00:08:27.235 --> 00:08:28.110
about Bletchley Park.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.020
But already, just because
I had the link to my blog

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:35.255
in my Twitter bio,
then lots of people

00:08:35.255 --> 00:08:37.380
started getting in touch
with me saying they wanted

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.350
to help to save Bletchley Park.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:40.240
So that was amazing.

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.039
And so here are the photos that
you can see here on screen.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:45.670
So there's Captain
Jerry Roberts,

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.940
who's one of the
code breakers who led

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.267
the Testery at Bletchley Park.

00:08:51.267 --> 00:08:52.100
He's an amazing guy.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.850
So he'd got in touch
with me in the summer

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:56.020
when I'd first been on TV.

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.550
He's there giving a talk at UCL.

00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:00.400
And his talk's online,
so I recommend--

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.462
if you google Captain
Jerry Roberts UCL,

00:09:03.462 --> 00:09:05.920
you should get his-- he's got
a one-hour lecture about what

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.990
he did there, which
is really interesting.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.200
And these other guys,
too, in the other photos.

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.158
So people that got in
touch me through Twitter,

00:09:13.158 --> 00:09:15.794
who were like social
media gurus-- you know,

00:09:15.794 --> 00:09:17.710
knew a lot more about
social media and Twitter

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:19.940
than I did in 2008.

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:24.000
And so we all went along to
one of Captain Jerry Roberts's

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.070
talks, and then we all
went up to Bletchley Park

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:28.290
I think the next day.

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:31.140
And it was really great to
see people who really knew

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.720
what to do with social media
at Bletchley Park, you know,

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.330
just so excited about
everything that was there,

00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:38.080
trying to kind of
cover everything

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.230
and kind of get the
message out there.

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:43.100
And so within a few
days really, I kind of

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.740
realized that
actually Twitter was

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.450
an amazing tool, an amazing
way to really sort of amplify

00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.140
your voice.

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:52.570
And running a campaign
through Twitter really

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:56.140
made a massive
impact quite quickly.

00:09:56.140 --> 00:09:58.280
So another thing that
happened through Twitter

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.810
was that-- so, you
know, I'd started

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.840
trying to build a
community, get people

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.410
excited about Bletchley Park.

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.820
And I was trying
to think of people

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.820
who were kind of, like,
key, influential people

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.570
who might be interested
in Bletchley Park.

00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:15.980
And I saw this photo.

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.510
Stephen Fry posted this photo
in I think February 2009.

00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.030
And-- oh, the date's on there.

00:10:23.030 --> 00:10:24.820
Yeah, February 2009.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:28.680
So he posted this photo
saying basically they're

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:30.847
stuck in a lift in
Centre Point in London

00:10:30.847 --> 00:10:31.930
and they couldn't get out.

00:10:31.930 --> 00:10:33.596
And it's like he was
tweeting, you know,

00:10:33.596 --> 00:10:36.710
like we've rang
the emergency bell,

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:38.040
we've tried phoning the number.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.810
No one's come.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:40.700
So we just tried
tweeting, as well.

00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.310
So I saw that photo of Stephen
Fry, and I thought Stephen Fry,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:47.080
he must be interested
in Bletchley Park.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.110
So I googled Stephen
Fry Bletchley Park,

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.310
and sure enough he was.

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.480
And there were various
quotes from him saying stuff

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.131
like if Bletchley
Park were to close,

00:10:55.131 --> 00:10:56.880
it'd be like Nelson's
Column falling down.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.254
And all sorts of
stuff like that.

00:10:58.254 --> 00:10:59.640
So I knew he was on board.

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.582
So luckily, he was
following me on Twitter.

00:11:02.582 --> 00:11:04.269
So I sent him several
direct messages

00:11:04.269 --> 00:11:06.060
saying if you got
involved in the campaign,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.893
I'm sure you'd make a
really big difference.

00:11:07.893 --> 00:11:10.520
You know, please could
you tweet about it.

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.500
And the next morning,
I got this tweet.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.730
So Stephen Fry
tweeted out a link

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:22.310
to my blog asking people
to sign the petition.

00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.030
And instead of--
I was getting then

00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:26.510
I think about 50 hits
a day on my blog,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.160
which I thought was great.

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.990
But then with one tweet from
Stephen Fry, I got 8,000.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:33.340
So that kind of shows
you the difference.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.379
And I think then he had
like 200,000 followers,

00:11:35.379 --> 00:11:36.920
whereas now he's
got several million.

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.710
So it just kind of shows you,
if you find the right people,

00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.865
you can just have a massive
impact really quickly.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.520
So over-- I guess the
campaign kind of ran really

00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:49.752
over about three years.

00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:52.210
So I've just told you roughly
about the stuff that happened

00:11:52.210 --> 00:11:54.360
in the first six months.

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.480
But what we did-- because
lots and lots of people

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:58.639
got involved, and
you know, I was kind

00:11:58.639 --> 00:11:59.930
of like cheerleadering the way.

00:11:59.930 --> 00:12:02.054
But lots of people were
just doing their own thing.

00:12:02.054 --> 00:12:06.160
So we had people
organizing comedy nights

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.910
as a benefit for Bletchley
Park, people walking up

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.610
to Everest base camp.

00:12:10.610 --> 00:12:11.940
Just really, really cool stuff.

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.400
And just loads of
people just went off

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.510
and did their own
thing, which I think

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.750
was really cool, to raise
money for Bletchley Park

00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:18.440
and awareness of Bletchley Park.

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.400
And one great thing that
we realized early on

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.610
was that, because we
had so many people who

00:12:24.610 --> 00:12:26.600
were quite active
on social media

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.700
and understood tech,
basically lots of geeks,

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.857
it was quite easy to get
them to talk to other people.

00:12:33.857 --> 00:12:35.440
You know, practically
everyone I spoke

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.925
to I said, what can you
do for Bletchley Park,

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:39.300
and go and tell
all your friends.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.620
And it really did work.

00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.480
You know, the message
really spread.

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.747
And so I might have
kind of started it off,

00:12:44.747 --> 00:12:46.330
but it just kind of
gradually just got

00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.288
bigger and bigger and
bigger, and more and more

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:51.280
people involved,
which was amazing.

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.544
So what happened with various
things like the Building

00:12:56.544 --> 00:12:58.460
with Pride award, which
I think this is about?

00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:59.542
Yeah, building prize.

00:12:59.542 --> 00:13:01.000
The Building with
Pride award was--

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.910
so there'd be some organization
which would have a competition,

00:13:04.910 --> 00:13:06.950
and this one was
Building with Pride.

00:13:06.950 --> 00:13:12.290
And basically, you need lots of
people to vote for your site.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:13.890
So the site was Bletchley Park.

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:17.520
And we kind of had a running
battle with the Needles Old

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:19.460
Battery on the Isle of Wight.

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:22.430
You could see online
who was winning.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.679
And as soon as it looked like
the Needles Old Battery was

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:28.720
kind of moving up in terms
of the amount of votes

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.680
that they got, we'd sort
of push out loads of stuff

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.080
and get people to vote
and tell everyone else

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:40.460
and get them to vote and kind of
do it in a really-- not a chain

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.820
reaction, like a ripple effect.

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:44.320
It's kind of a
way to try and get

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.816
more and more people to vote
on stuff or to lobby people

00:13:48.816 --> 00:13:51.610
or-- it just grew
into some really

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:55.960
kind of amazing organic
campaign over the years.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.150
And so it was like if
someone saw some opportunity,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:01.070
they'd alert someone
else and they'd alert--

00:14:01.070 --> 00:14:03.080
and it just kind of grew
into this massive thing

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.496
where as soon as
there was one message,

00:14:05.496 --> 00:14:06.870
someone pinged
something, it just

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.995
went out really quickly to
lots and lots of people.

00:14:08.995 --> 00:14:12.050
And then we all swooped
in to do whatever

00:14:12.050 --> 00:14:16.750
it was that needed to be done.

00:14:16.750 --> 00:14:19.710
So I campaigned
over several years.

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:20.880
Here's my family.

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:25.290
So my two sons there,
for their 23rd birthday--

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.600
this is during the
campaign-- I said that I'd

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.340
take them on a surprise trip.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:33.946
And you know, looking back,
I just think, how on Earth

00:14:33.946 --> 00:14:35.320
did they put up
with me doing all

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:37.150
this stuff over several years?

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.640
So for their 23rd birthday,
they got an exciting trip

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:41.500
to Bletchley Park.

00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:44.650
And here we are, standing
outside Station X.

00:14:44.650 --> 00:14:47.070
And it's just, I
couldn't have done

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.120
what I'd done without
my family supporting me.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.900
And they've just been so
ridiculously supportive.

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.450
Even my kids, kind of growing
up, like my little one there.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.220
You know, they've
all basically put up

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.629
with me spending so
much spare time trying

00:15:01.629 --> 00:15:03.170
to raise awareness
of Bletchley Park,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:06.300
and I really thank
them for that.

00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:10.090
So just a couple of other things
that we did during the time.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:12.750
As I said, I was always trying
to find influential people.

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.760
I found a guy called
Phil Willis, MP,

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.990
who'd just started
using Twitter,

00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:21.550
and he was head of the
Universities and Science

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:22.760
Committee.

00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:24.660
I saw him tweeting and
I just thought, oh,

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.120
I'm going to see if he's
interested in Bletchley Park.

00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:28.370
I think he probably will be.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:32.840
So I tweeted him, ended up
chatting to him on Twitter,

00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:35.330
and then got a 10-minute
slot to go in and chat

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:36.610
to him about Bletchley Park.

00:15:36.610 --> 00:15:39.250
So I went in to see him.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.100
And I told him all
about the campaign

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.550
and said, what can you do?

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:45.060
What can you do
for Bletchley Park?

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.200
And he said, I'll set up an EDM.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.560
So I said, wow, that's great.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.290
What's an EDM?

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:51.590
I had absolutely no
idea what it was.

00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:54.250
And it's an Early
Day Motion, which

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:56.640
he said was basically
to raise awareness

00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:59.890
in parliament or in government
around different issues.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.200
And so he set up an EDM
asking for operational funding

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.274
for Bletchley Park.

00:16:06.274 --> 00:16:07.690
So another thing
that happened was

00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.410
I really wanted to introduce
the people at Bletchley

00:16:10.410 --> 00:16:12.902
Park, the management, to the
international museum community

00:16:12.902 --> 00:16:14.610
to kind of get them
networked in with all

00:16:14.610 --> 00:16:16.170
of these people
around the world.

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:18.336
And I also wanted the
international museum community

00:16:18.336 --> 00:16:20.612
to know about Bletchley Park
and what they were doing,

00:16:20.612 --> 00:16:22.070
and the fact that
they needed help.

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:25.190
So I wrote a paper
with Kelsey Griffin

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.350
from Bletchley Park
and Professor Jonathan

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.310
Bowen, who's a museums expert.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.710
And we submitted our paper.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:34.740
And luckily, it got accepted
for this conference.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.240
And then when it got
accepted, I though,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:38.460
oh no, what have I done?

00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.300
Because the conference
is in Denver.

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.390
I've now kind of set
Bletchley Park up

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.200
to have to pay for
me and someone else

00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:46.144
to go over to Denver
and deliver the paper.

00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:47.560
But what I'm
actually trying to do

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.810
is to get money to come
in to Bletchley Park.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.580
So I was a bit depressed
about what I did,

00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.030
the sort of situation
that I'd engineered,

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.100
not really thinking
about the money aspect.

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.690
And so just chatting about that
on Twitter with some friends,

00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.840
they persuaded me to set up
a JustGiving account, which

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:04.680
I did.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:07.540
And it amazed me that,
within two weeks,

00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.450
it was fully funded, which meant
that we could go over to Denver

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:14.550
and deliver our paper,
which was great.

00:17:14.550 --> 00:17:16.839
And these are the
avatars of all the people

00:17:16.839 --> 00:17:18.960
that funded it, so
thanks very much to them.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.534
My favorite is Mr. Grasshead
at the top in the middle.

00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.847
And so while we were in
Denver, after we delivered

00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:29.430
the paper and the
conference finished,

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.400
we got stuck there because
of the Icelandic volcano.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:36.800
So a crazy thing that
happened was that someone

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:38.510
that was coming over
here to give a talk,

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.660
I think at Bletchley
Park, on software testing,

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:42.640
we had a mutual friend.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.230
And they saw that we
were stuck in Denver,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.900
and their plane got
turned around in the air,

00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:47.566
so they were halfway
to England and they

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:48.840
got sent back to Denver.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:53.670
So we ended up meeting up
for breakfast one Sunday

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:57.590
and, you know, chatting about
Bletchley Park and stuff.

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:02.920
And so it's Lisa
Crispin who's the person

00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.880
that we invited for breakfast.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:07.109
She was saying, what are
you guys going to do today?

00:18:07.109 --> 00:18:09.400
And we'd kind of been stuck
in the conference in Denver

00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.540
for several days.

00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:12.870
So we're like, we want
to get out of Denver

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:14.610
and just go and see
some countryside.

00:18:14.610 --> 00:18:16.700
And so basically, she
invited us for a day

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.270
at her friend's ranch.

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:22.390
And this is me learning
how to talk to a llama

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:23.770
by blowing up its nose.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.954
So I just think it's
like llama whispering.

00:18:25.954 --> 00:18:28.370
So I just thought, just some
really random things happened

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.240
to me, but great fun too.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:35.356
So in 2011, about three years
after we started campaigning,

00:18:35.356 --> 00:18:37.140
Simon Greenish,
the director, said

00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.870
that Bletchley Park was
saved, that he knew, then,

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:41.560
that they were
financially stable

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.110
and they wouldn't have to close.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:45.020
So that was really cool.

00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:46.680
How much time have I got?

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:47.290
Four minutes?

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.030
Is that right.

00:18:49.030 --> 00:18:49.620
Yeah.

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:54.250
So another quick thing,
which involves Google.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.400
So I don't know if you saw a
few years ago that the Turing

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.930
papers, or some of
Turing's papers,

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.810
were up for auction
at Christie's.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.680
And a great guy called Gareth
Halfacree set up a JustGiving

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.580
account to try and
help Bletchley Park

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.030
to buy the Turing papers.

00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:12.880
And after a couple
of weeks, he'd

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.160
raised 20,000 pounds,
which was really great,

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.940
but I think the asking
price was 300,000.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.520
So unfortunately, he
wasn't anywhere near that.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:28.480
And I was at an event at Nesta,
and Megan Smith from Google

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.810
was speaking on the platform.

00:19:29.810 --> 00:19:30.820
I didn't know her.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.697
And I just was kind
of thinking, you know,

00:19:33.697 --> 00:19:34.780
I need to approach people.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:35.700
Who can I talk to?

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:36.510
And I just thought, Google.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:37.690
They must have some money.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.554
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:40.970
It's quite funny
saying that here,

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.430
because normally I'm
saying that with people

00:19:42.430 --> 00:19:43.450
who aren't at Google.

00:19:43.450 --> 00:19:47.053
But I'm glad you all laughed
and didn't throw stuff at me.

00:19:47.053 --> 00:19:47.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:50.790
So Google, they must
have some money.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:54.590
So basically, I went to chat to
Megan, told her about Turing,

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:56.080
about Bletchley Park.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.480
She said, send me an email,
so I sent her an email.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:02.200
And luckily, a couple of
days later or a day later,

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:04.310
a guy called Simon
Meacham, who you

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.510
might know from Google,
who was working here,

00:20:07.510 --> 00:20:09.090
got in touch via Twitter.

00:20:09.090 --> 00:20:11.690
And basically, I told
him what I told Megan.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:14.070
And basically what
happened was, they

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:16.690
worked together with Peter
Barron from here, I think,

00:20:16.690 --> 00:20:21.360
to raise $100,000 to help
Bletchley Park by the Turing

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.300
papers.

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:23.880
So unfortunately,
that wasn't enough.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.990
But some things went
on behind the scenes,

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.450
and eventually, Bletchley Park
did get the Turing papers,

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:29.200
so that was great.

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:33.160
So thank you, Google,
for making that happen.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.950
So one of the greatest things
for me in being involved

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:37.765
has been to meet
some of the veterans.

00:20:37.765 --> 00:20:39.390
Because they're just
incredible people.

00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:41.348
They're kind of everything
you want them to be.

00:20:41.348 --> 00:20:45.110
They're really smart, usually
really good sense of humor,

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.230
just rapier-like wits.

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.950
And so this is Jerry Roberts,
here, meeting the Queen.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.260
So it was a great moment
to see that happen,

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.100
because when I
started campaigning,

00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:04.070
it was like most traditional
institutions just weren't

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.272
interested, or just
weren't that keen,

00:21:08.272 --> 00:21:10.230
I think, really to get
involved with Bletchley.

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:13.900
So the way that everyone saw
Bletchley Park kind of now

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.600
as a going concern, it was
great that that changed.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:18.990
And it was great to see the
veterans getting recognition

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:19.490
as well.

00:21:19.490 --> 00:21:21.410
That was really cool.

00:21:21.410 --> 00:21:24.070
And here's just,
I like this photo.

00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:25.990
It's me and Simon
Meacham from Google.

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:28.190
So this is the
first time we met up

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:30.860
after we had this
whole-- it's in the book.

00:21:30.860 --> 00:21:33.720
I can't do it justice in
one minute or something.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.073
But we had Megan
and Simon Meacham

00:21:37.073 --> 00:21:40.650
and me trying to get the
$100,000 from Google,

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:42.304
and trying to make stuff happen.

00:21:42.304 --> 00:21:44.720
We just kind of had this very
exciting time, lots of phone

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:46.780
calls, and it was very cool.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:48.880
And so this is the
first time that we

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.250
got to meet up after
all of that happened,

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.140
see the Turing papers
at Bletchley Park.

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.800
And this is our photo with
the statue of Alan Turing.

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:03.300
So that's a really quick
run through of several years

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:04.970
campaigning.

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:08.990
I'm delighted to be here, and
happy to answer your questions.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:10.980
Thank you.

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:13.920
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:17.113 --> 00:22:18.821
MODERATOR: It's clear
that Bletchley Park

00:22:18.821 --> 00:22:21.445
is a tremendously important part
of our cultural and scientific

00:22:21.445 --> 00:22:22.022
heritage.

00:22:22.022 --> 00:22:23.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:24.750
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:26.166
MODERATOR: We have
some questions.

00:22:26.166 --> 00:22:27.250
One in the front.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.348
AUDIENCE: It's
really admirable what

00:22:33.348 --> 00:22:35.526
you've done with this
project, but more

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:41.166
touching on the point, why is
it that it got to that point?

00:22:41.166 --> 00:22:43.700
And also, for a country
that prides itself

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:49.274
on its Britishness, and also
the disappointing fact that,

00:22:49.274 --> 00:22:51.545
for such a long time,
the royal family actually

00:22:51.545 --> 00:22:56.290
distanced themselves from the
public apology to Alan Turing.

00:22:56.290 --> 00:23:00.839
Why has the government
also taken such a long time

00:23:00.839 --> 00:23:02.878
to react upon that as well?

00:23:02.878 --> 00:23:04.520
Is there an answer to that?

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.849
SUE BLACK: I can
give you my opinion,

00:23:06.849 --> 00:23:08.390
but I don't actually
know the answer.

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:11.580
I mean, in my opinion, I think
because it was all kept secret

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.310
for such a long
time, it's just not

00:23:13.310 --> 00:23:15.420
really in our public
consciousness.

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:17.490
And so by the time
everyone started

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.659
to know what had
actually happened there,

00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:22.200
it's like it had kind of been
written out of history, really,

00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.460
so it's like quite hard to
them to put something back

00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:25.690
into history.

00:23:25.690 --> 00:23:27.660
And I think it's
just taken time,

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.910
because I've just seen a
really big change in people's

00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:36.340
attitudes from when, like 2007,
when I started campaigning,

00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:40.574
you know, most people were sort
of interested, but not really.

00:23:40.574 --> 00:23:42.490
Whereas now, if you talk
about Bletchley Park,

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.750
everyone's like,
oh, Bletchley Park.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:46.208
You know, it's really, really
changed in like, what's that,

00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:47.107
eight years now.

00:23:47.107 --> 00:23:49.440
And I just think probably
because it was kind of written

00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:52.660
out of history, so it's quite
hard to just put it back in.

00:23:52.660 --> 00:23:55.105
But like once everyone
hears the stories, you know,

00:23:55.105 --> 00:23:56.730
hears lots of different
people speaking

00:23:56.730 --> 00:24:00.332
about what happened there,
then that kind of helps

00:24:00.332 --> 00:24:02.540
it to grow in people's minds
of what it actually was.

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:04.873
And they hear it from various
different places, not just

00:24:04.873 --> 00:24:05.560
one place.

00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.180
So that's my guess.

00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:14.400
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.152
We actually went to a team
on site in Bletchley Park

00:24:16.152 --> 00:24:17.460
like a week ago,
and it was awesome,

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:18.490
so thank you very much.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:19.730
SUE BLACK: Awesome.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.136
Oh, thank you.

00:24:21.136 --> 00:24:22.740
AUDIENCE: This is
more about, so we

00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:24.698
went to the National
Museum of Computing, which

00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:25.440
is also at Bletchley Park.

00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.090
SUE BLACK: Yeah.

00:24:26.090 --> 00:24:26.990
AUDIENCE: And it seemed
like Bletchley Park

00:24:26.990 --> 00:24:28.913
had a lot of money,
a lot of funding,

00:24:28.913 --> 00:24:29.996
and was doing really well.

00:24:29.996 --> 00:24:32.079
The National Museum of
Computing, while fantastic,

00:24:32.079 --> 00:24:33.930
was really struggling.

00:24:33.930 --> 00:24:35.930
And when we spoke to
the people about it,

00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:38.930
there seemed to be a little bit
of a dispute between the two

00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:39.430
groups.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:40.942
I don't know if you have
anything to add on that,

00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:42.442
because it seemed
like both of those

00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:44.204
were equally worthy
of preservation,

00:24:44.204 --> 00:24:48.130
because the National Museum of
Computing has Colossus in it,

00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:51.779
and that should not be lost, and
we should definitely keep that.

00:24:51.779 --> 00:24:53.570
But I don't know what
your view is on that.

00:24:53.570 --> 00:24:56.560
SUE BLACK: How
long have you got?

00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:01.120
I think there's-- I still don't
really know why the dispute

00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:01.620
happened.

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.140
I don't know.

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.290
Dermot probably knows
more about it than I do,

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:07.660
having been involved longer.

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.990
But from my point of
view, it seems to me

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:14.642
that they both kind of
want the same thing.

00:25:14.642 --> 00:25:16.100
They're both
preserving stuff which

00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:19.050
is really, really important.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.460
I have always really wanted
them to work together,

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:24.650
but for various reasons,
that hasn't happened yet.

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:26.230
Dermot's got his
thumb up as well.

00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:28.900
Because, I think,
being separate,

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.340
there's less opportunities
for the site as a whole.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:34.190
And I think most people from
the outside see it as one place.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:37.010
And I think, even
though I know, I still

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.020
forget to say and the
Museum of Computing.

00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:41.470
Because in my head, still,
it's all the same place, right?

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:43.985
But they kind of get left
out, the Museum of Computing.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.570
I don't know what
to do about it.

00:25:49.570 --> 00:25:51.680
If it was up to me-- sorry?

00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.806
AUDIENCE: Next book, maybe.

00:25:52.806 --> 00:25:53.472
SUE BLACK: Yeah.

00:25:53.472 --> 00:25:54.149
Maybe, maybe.

00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:56.440
Maybe me and Dermot will have
a chat afterwards and see

00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.540
if we can come up with a plan.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:58.040
But yeah.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:00.927
I mean, it pains me that
they're not working together,

00:26:00.927 --> 00:26:02.510
and especially now
that there's, like,

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:04.327
a fence up between the two.

00:26:04.327 --> 00:26:06.660
The first time I saw that, I
honestly did cry, because I

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:10.380
just thought, that's terrible.

00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:10.980
But yeah.

00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.740
I mean, I don't know how
it all started, really.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.154
I think it's just personalities.

00:26:14.154 --> 00:26:15.320
I just don't know the story.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.010
I think, like most things, it's
probably a long and complicated

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.744
story over many years.

00:26:20.744 --> 00:26:22.080
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.036
SUE BLACK: Thank you.

00:26:23.036 --> 00:26:23.744
MODERATOR: Great.

00:26:23.744 --> 00:26:26.976
I think we have
time for one more.

00:26:26.976 --> 00:26:29.440
AUDIENCE: In terms of
crowd fund raising,

00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.078
2008 was quite a long time ago
in internet years, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:33.078 --> 00:26:35.453
How do you think you might
have approached it differently

00:26:35.453 --> 00:26:37.708
if you were starting
from scratch now?

00:26:37.708 --> 00:26:39.704
SUE BLACK: That's
a good question.

00:26:39.704 --> 00:26:41.370
Yeah, I think it is
quite different now.

00:26:41.370 --> 00:26:42.870
One thing that
I've really noticed

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.870
is that, when people want
to start campaigns now,

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.180
they just start them, and
they work straight away, you

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:50.110
know, which didn't
really happen then.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:26:52.930
So I think social
media, and the amount

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:56.320
of people using social media,
and people's knowledge of how

00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.960
to use social media
has really, really,

00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.640
massively moved on
from 2007 and 2008.

00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:05.835
So I think it would have been a
lot farther-- if I was doing it

00:27:05.835 --> 00:27:07.460
now, of course,
Bletchley Park probably

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.418
would have shut by now.

00:27:08.418 --> 00:27:12.041
But if I was trying to do
the same sort of thing now,

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:14.124
I think it would have been
a lot easier, probably.

00:27:14.124 --> 00:27:15.860
AUDIENCE: Because
Kickstarting is recognized.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:16.776
SUE BLACK: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:16.776 --> 00:27:18.400
So everyone understands
crowdfunding.

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.440
So many more people on Twitter.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:23.690
You know, I mean, it's just a
kind of a different landscape

00:27:23.690 --> 00:27:24.680
really, completely now.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:32.990
And I see the recent campaign
against taking the suffragettes

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:34.580
out of A-level politics.

00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.710
So it was my friend who
noticed that who tweeted me.

00:27:38.710 --> 00:27:40.830
I said, you should write
a blog post about it.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:42.730
She wrote a blog post,
she pinged it out,

00:27:42.730 --> 00:27:43.982
sent it to all her friends.

00:27:43.982 --> 00:27:45.190
I pinged it out to everybody.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:48.080
Lots of other people pinged
it out to loads of people,

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:52.860
and then, you know, she's
on the news within days,

00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:54.910
and stuff happening,
and people listening.

00:27:54.910 --> 00:27:56.400
And politicians
are on Twitter now,

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.774
which they weren't,
really, then.

00:27:57.774 --> 00:28:00.800
And so you can have an impact
much, much more quickly now

00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:02.667
than you could then.

00:28:02.667 --> 00:28:03.500
MODERATOR: Fabulous.

00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:04.700
Thank you very much, Sue.

00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:06.200
Thank you very much, Dermot.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.700
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:09.250
SUE BLACK: Thank you.
