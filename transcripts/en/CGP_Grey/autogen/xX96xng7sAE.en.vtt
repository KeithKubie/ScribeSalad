00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.769
 divided neatly, resulting in a different number of days in the month of 30 or 31 days. 3 00: 00: 08,769 -&gt; 00: 00: 13,219 to February - the black sheep - who only gets 28 ... except when she gets 29 and 4 00: 00: 13,219 -&gt; 00: 00: 15,870 then year has 366 days. 5 00: 00: 15,870 -&gt; 00: 00: 18,910 Why is this happening? 6 00: 00: 18,910 -&gt; 00: 00: 19,640 What are the crazy universes in which years are shorter than ever? 7 00: 00: 19,640 -&gt; 00: 00: 22,190 If we were to answer this question, we need to know what exactly is the year? 8 00: 00: 22,190 -&gt; 00: 00: 25,610 If we pre-simplify it, it is time the Earth needs to make a full circle around 9 00: 00: 25,610 -&gt; 00: 00: 28,320Sunc. This coincidentally coincided with the changing of the seasons. 10 00: 00: 28,320 -&gt; 00: 00: 31,730 Now, when we draw a small diagram like this that shows the Earth's Circumference around the Sun 11 00: 00: 31,730 -&gt; 00: 00: 35,190 it looks simple but exactly follows the Earth's rotation the country is complicated because the universe does not provide us with a suitable map to monitor the development of the situation, 12 00: 00: 35,190 -&gt; 00: 00: 37,430. 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.500
 On Earth you just see a change of seasons and an obvious way of measuring their 14 00: 00: 40,500 -&gt; 00: 00: 45,260 it is a change to count the days that pass through the 365 day calendar. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.210
 But as soon as we start using this calendar, it slowly falls off from sync with the annuals. 16 00: 00: 49,210 -&gt; 00: 00: 52,079 And with every year that passes the deflection is bigger and bigger. 17 00: 00: 52,079 -&gt; 00: 00: 55,810 In the three decades the calendar will be mistaken for the whole week, and in a few hundred years the entire season 18 00: 00: 55,810 -&gt; 00: 01: 00,100 can be mixed - what would mean that Christmas would celebrate in the middle of summer - What would be crazy. 19 00: 01: 00,100 -&gt; 00: 01: 03,149 Why is this happening? Did we count the days wrong? Well, the calendar envisages 20 00: 01: 03,149 -&gt; 00: 01: 08,069 the Earth's need to make a circle around the Sun is 8,760 hours. But more precisely measured 21 00: 01: 08,069 -&gt; 00: 01: 11,479 with a stopwatch lasts longer than the one scheduled for the calendar 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.100
 for about 6 hours. That's why our calendar is moving faster than the season 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.020
 alternate. 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.630
 so we come to the basic problem of all calendars: to day / night changes 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.749
 Although simple to measure, they have nothing to do with the year. 

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:27.240
 Day and night are caused by Earth rotation around its axis. 00: 01: 30,740 -&gt; 00: 01: 30,740 To the sun, the day is on the other side of the night. But this rotation is not 28 00: 01: 30,740 -&gt; 00:01 : 34,009 more connected to the movement of Earth around the Sun than ballerina turning to 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.619
 a truck associated with the speed of a truck. 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.259
 count the time that the ballerina turned to predict the speed of the truck 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.359
 can give us approximate value, but it is crazy to assume that this is the exact value. 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.479
 Counting the days to keep track of the Earth's movement around the Sun is just the same, so we can not stay 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:50.789
 surprised when the Earth does not make exactly 365 turns in one year. 34 00: 01: 50,789 -&gt; 00: 01: 56,310 It's also irrational that although 365 days are too short, 366 is too much and still causes 35 00: 01: 56,310 -&gt; 00: 01: 58,740 a sync in sync, only in the opposite direction. 36 00: 01: 58,740 -&gt; 00: 02: 02,069 The resignation for this is all: a sad year. Where February gets one more day, but only 37 00: 02: 02,069 -&gt; 00: 02: 03,439 every 4 years. 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.039
 This is because we're short for a quarter of a year, so after four days 00: 02: 07,039 -&gt; 00: 02: 09,390 we're adding one day to match. 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.230
 Huzzah! The problem is resolved. 41 00: 02: 11,230 -&gt; 00: 02: 12,540 Besides, what is not. 42 00: 02: 12,540 -&gt; 00: 02: 15,739 spending calendar for one day every 4 years is a bit too much, and a calendar 43 00: 02: 15,739 -&gt; 00: 02: 19,129 is still late for annual holidays one day every 100 years. 44 00: 02: 19,129 -&gt; 00: 02: 22,459 What's fine for those who are still, but not for calendar designers who want to be 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.680
 perfectly matched. 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.739
 To correct this mistake every cent of the century is overwhelming. 47 00: 02: 26,739 -&gt; 00: 02: 30,540 So that 1896 and 1904 were offensive, but 1900 did not. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.239
 It's better now, but still not ideal because the calendar is a bit too fast 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.000
 1 day in 400 years. 50 00: 02: 36,000 -&gt; 00: 02: 39,030 That's why there is an additional clause that says that if the century 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.879
 divisible by 400, then it will be an offensive year. 52 00: 02: 41,879 -&gt; 00: 02: 45,159 That way the 1900 and 2100 were not offensive, but 2000 is. 53 00: 02: 45,159 -&gt; 00: 02: 49,180 So these three rules of error have been revealed to 1 day in 8,000 years, 54 00: 02: 49,180 -&gt; 00: 02: 52,569 what the current calendar determines as a negligible mistake, ends the story. 55 00: 02: 52,569 -&gt; 00: 02: 55,390 They were trying to find out if agriculture was a good business for 8000 years in the future 57 00: 02: 58,730 -&gt; 00: 03: 01,549 Let's hope we use a much more precise calendar that measures the days. 58 00: 03: 01,549 -&gt; 00: 03: 06,150 But you're a mathematician and an error of 0.0001 percent is unacceptable in your eyes 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:07.079
 and must be removed. 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.730
 "Poor happiness" corresponds to your universe, because even the day is not constant. Races 61 00: 03: 10,730 -&gt; 00: 03: 14,930 are alternated in milliseconds so that shorter / longer 1 millisecond 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.810
 every 100 years. Which means it's virtually impossible to make a perfect calendar 63 00: 03: 18,810 -&gt; 00: 03: 19,969 which will last forever. 64 00: 03: 19,969 -&gt; 00: 03: 23,090 In theory, the length of the day should be extended to be the same month - but not 65 00: 03: 23,090 -&gt; 00: 03: 27,019 it's needed three hundred years, and our Sun expands and will eventually destroy us 66 00: 03: 27,019 -&gt; 00: 03: 28,799 before we calculate it. 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.129
 I'm sorry, I do not know how we moved from the offensive year to the inevitable 

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.299
 the death of all human civilization - if we of course have enough resources for the research of the universe 69 00: 03: 35,299 -&gt; 00: 03: 37,349 (NA, SA) - but it is. 70 00: 03: 37,349 -&gt; 00: 03: 40,409To the next 8,000 years of age will be matched with the calendar 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.890
 but in an extremely complicated way.
