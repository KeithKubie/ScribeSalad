in science we need as many

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320
in science we need as many
 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.560
in science we need as many
scientifically literate people as we can

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570
scientifically literate people as we can
 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.150
scientifically literate people as we can
in our society so that when it's time to

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
in our society so that when it's time to
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.160

we do it with an informed way with
 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.760
we do it with an informed way with
science as the background so thank you

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770
science as the background so thank you
 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.369

science so in the future we'll have

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460
science so in the future we'll have
 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150

scientifically literate people and what

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160
scientifically literate people and what
 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.280
scientifically literate people and what
we want is for people it's not just the

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290
we want is for people it's not just the
 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.800

change as we learn more but the big
 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.390
change as we learn more but the big
thing is to get the process of science

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400
thing is to get the process of science
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.390

you make an observation your eyebrows go

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400
you make an observation your eyebrows go
 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.420
you make an observation your eyebrows go
up you save yourself my goodness what

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430
up you save yourself my goodness what
 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.940
up you save yourself my goodness what
caused that then you come up with an

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950
caused that then you come up with an
 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.700
caused that then you come up with an
idea or a hypothesis of what made that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
idea or a hypothesis of what made that
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.740
idea or a hypothesis of what made that
effect happen it's a phenomenon that you

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750
effect happen it's a phenomenon that you
 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.719
effect happen it's a phenomenon that you
observe and then you come up with a way

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729
observe and then you come up with a way
 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.090
observe and then you come up with a way
to test it you test it and then you see

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100
to test it you test it and then you see
 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.350
to test it you test it and then you see
what happened and compare what you

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360
what happened and compare what you
 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.700
what happened and compare what you
thought would happen with what did

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710
thought would happen with what did
 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.130
thought would happen with what did
happen and you're right compare your

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140
happen and you're right compare your
 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.859
happen and you're right compare your
hypothesis to the outcome if we can get

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869
hypothesis to the outcome if we can get
 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690
hypothesis to the outcome if we can get
that across to as many people as

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700
that across to as many people as
 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.569
that across to as many people as
possible we can Tracy dare I say it

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579
possible we can Tracy dare I say it
 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.990
possible we can Tracy dare I say it
change the world it's a great question

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000
 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.060
you
