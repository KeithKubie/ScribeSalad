&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:17.040
[ Silence ]

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.340
&gt;&gt; ERIC FRAZIER:
Welcome everyone.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.740
Welcome to the rare book and
special collections division,

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.880
Thursday at 3 lecture series.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.180
My name is Eric Frazier, I'm a
rare book reference librarian

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.880
in the rare book special
collections division

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.420
and I'm thrilled to introduce
Adrenne Lundgren to talk to us

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.130
about photographic
technology manuals.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.270
Those manuals that are here
in the rare book division.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.420
Adrenne is conservation
division's photographic liaison

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.720
for rare books.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.690
She's also been instrumental

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.440
in helping us understand
the intellectual

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.090
and cultural value
of these pieces.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.800
Adrenne has spent quite a bit
of time developing an index

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.300
to those books that have
early photograph and examples

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.900
of photographic paper.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.960
She's a wonderful
colleague and her excitement

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.510
for the material is contagious.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.140
Even after she's left the room,

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.700
you're wondering why you
haven't spent more time

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.440
with 19th century
photographic [inaudible].

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.990
Yeah, I know, right.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.750
So, I halfheartedly thanked her
1 time when she brought a manual

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.130
down to us and she put it
in front of me and said,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.400
look at this piece, it's made
with uranium and I didn't want

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.700
to seem like a beginner
[inaudible].

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.000
So, I just, you know, very
casually threw up an objection

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.330
as to are you sure that's safe?

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.990
And she said oh yeah,
I checked it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.290
out with our [inaudible]
counter.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.150
You know, we're very impressed
when we get a new loop,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.020
you know, a new magnifying loop,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.170
but apparently the [inaudible]
counter is down stairs.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.020
She was able to spend quite a
bit of time with this collection

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.660
and other photographic
collections

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.800
when she was the
[inaudible] in 2012.

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.580
Her project was called
photographs of Holland,

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.980
excuse me, photographs
of [inaudible],

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.730
creating a material spaced
catalog resume for photography

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.600
and she has a web cast by the
same name that's available

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.830
on the Library of
Congress web cast page.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:36.770
Adrenne's talk will
last about 35 minutes

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:39.950
and if we can keep the
questions to the very end,

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.340
that would be very,
that would be helpful.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.470
And for those of you
in the audience today,

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.250
you can see that we have quite
a few examples around the table.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.420
At the very end,
if we let Adrenne

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.090
and Adrenne alone turn the
pages for those pieces,

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.390
that would be helpful as well.

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.690
All right.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:00.990
Thank you very much.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.790
Adrenne Lundgren.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.040
[ Background noise ]

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.340
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Wow.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.660
This is a big crowd, like way
bigger than I ever thought.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.310
When you take photo
manual perfectly.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.690
This crowd.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.990
All right.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.810
So, we're in the [inaudible]
room of the Library of Congress

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.000
and I just feel so
honored to speak today

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.230
about photographic
technical manuals in this room

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.390
because a lot of
people would argue

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.500
that maybe they don't
have a place here and with

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.460
such prestigious company,
but I hope that after today,

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.480
you'll maybe think that
they do have a little place

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.780
that they could hold in here

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.260
and that they're really
incredible artifacts

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.260
that can tell us a
lot about image making

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.590
and photography of
the 19th century.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.490
So, the TR classification
of the Library

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.190
of Congress is the designation
for photographic technology

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.160
and when you're a photo
conservator like me,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.690
this is like the holy grail.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:07.820
It's like, you wonder something
and you go into the TR section

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.720
and the answers are
like there for you.

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.750
So, when I came to the
Library of Congress,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.940
I went into the TR
section having been

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.580
in other institutions where
that section's very small,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.680
maybe a couple hundred books
and we had 78,000 books.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.620
So, I'm like whoa, it's like
[inaudible] that I can see

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.530
for row after row after row.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.830
And of course, you know, we're
at the Library of Congress

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.720
so you imagine that there are
books that exist nowhere else

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.230
in the world and that's true.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.490
But, actually what was
really fascinating to me

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.930
about the collection was there
were books with original samples

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.300
in them and I became
really interested in these

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.920
and really started to see
the untouched potential

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.770
in these books.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.030
So, let's get, let's get going.

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.270
So, to understand the history
of photography, we really need

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.580
to understand that it's
a manufactured history

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.770
for the most part which means,
you would buy these things

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.320
to make photographs on, right.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.930
So, even as Daguerre was
announcing the Daguerre type

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.210
in 1839, he was simultaneously
forming a partnership

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.910
with his brother in
law Alfon [inaudible]

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.820
and he was marketing
photographic cameras

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.920
but also supplies
to make photographs

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:19.570
and photographic varnishes.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.510
So, here's a Daguerre camera.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:25.760
You can see his label and
he would sign each camera.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.060
They're very cool.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.250
They have one at the
George Eastman museum.

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.800
And soon after Daguerre type
plates were manufactured

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.730
in factories in the
United States and abroad

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.870
and then larger factories
started

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.360
to open not only
manufacturing plates,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.090
but also supplying everything

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.940
for the process including the
housing the photographs would go

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.880
in after they were made.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.160
And so, here's one
of those factories.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:58.990
This is the E. Anthony and
company later to be E&amp;HT Anthony

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:00.880
and we'll hear about
them later in the talk,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.660
but in this illustration, you
see workers creating brass mats

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.340
and preservers like
those you see used

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.490
to house this Daguerre
type in the corner.

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.270
So, they would make these metal
pieces that then you would put

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:16.710
on to the Daguerre type.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.170
And so, as a conservator,
I wonder like,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.670
wouldn't it be great to know

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.210
which mats E&amp;HT Anthony
were actually making

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.420
and like wouldn't it be great
to know if this by E&amp;HT Anthony

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.420
or if this artist used
their work or, you know,

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.990
if 90% of what we have in
extant Daguerre types is made

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:37.290
by this factory.

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.670
Like, I find myself asking
those questions and so far

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:43.350
with the manuals that we
have documented so far,

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.980
we can't necessarily answer
that particular question,

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.090
but these manuals do tell
us a tremendous amount

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.610
about the manufacturers of
photographic papers, varnishes,

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:58.100
accessories, paper
mats and mounts.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.950
So, much of that information

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:02.120
about this manufactured
history is stored

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.920
in these 78,000 volumes that
we have here at the library.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.660
And information like this
gives us an unpreceded look

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.390
at like the industry surrounding
photography that was used

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:16.010
to make billions of
images in the 19th century.

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:17.310
[ Background noise ]

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.610
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: So,

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.140
we should understand
this history much better.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.720
So, here's one such
[inaudible] that we found

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.370
in a photographic serial called
the Philadelphia Photographer.

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:31.800
And so, besides just
providing a sample photograph,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.960
these images are often
accompanied by recipes

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.950
and then the advertisements.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.130
So, the recipe will tell you
exactly how this photograph was

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:44.430
made and then the advertisement
will tell you what company

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:47.810
marketed it, how they
marketed it to photographers

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:52.300
which tells you a lot about
like the overall like goals

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:54.440
or what aesthetics
they are appealing

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.970
to for photographers
and artists.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:00.670
And we also will know when
the sample was produced

00:08:00.670 --> 00:08:01.970
because they're made in books

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:03.960
and books have a
publication date.

00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:11.330
So, they have this great dating
stamp on them that's reliable.

00:08:11.330 --> 00:08:15.210
And we know that this
print for instance,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.370
is a salted paper
print from the recipe.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:19.630
It was made on SAX paper.

00:08:19.630 --> 00:08:21.810
So, to know the paper
is very unusual.

00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:25.400
It was gold toned using alkaline
gold toner in post process

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.440
with a gum Arabic varnish.

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.560
We also know that this
print had to have been made

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.370
between June and July of 1864.

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:35.250
So, to have this level of detail

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:38.750
about a photographic print is
very rare if you find one kind

00:08:38.750 --> 00:08:42.670
of in the wild, right, but
we have one captured for us

00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.860
at the perfect specimen
of 1864 salted paper.

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:52.150
And when we have this level of
detail, this knowing the paper,

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:55.460
how it was made, what its
varnish was and the date,

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:58.540
then we can call this
a reference collection.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.960
And so, it's something
that conservators

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.010
and scientists refer to a lot.

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.040
A reference collection
is a collection

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.490
that provides known quantities

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.640
for which unknown quantities
can then be compared

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:15.820
and these collections can be
examined either analytically

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.090
or visually and they tell
us a lot about works of art.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:22.010
All right.

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.260
So, just for some of
you who don't know a lot

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.770
about conservation and kind of
things to do with conservation,

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:31.100
the use of reference
collections and the aid

00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:36.530
of technical art history was
really established in the 1930's

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:39.190
with the creation of the
Forbes pigment collection.

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:42.050
And so, Edward Forbes was the
director of the Fog Art museum

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:46.400
at Harvard and he began to
collect pigments of known date

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.000
and chemical composition in
order to really aid people

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.920
in understanding
painted materials

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:57.110
and then he assembled this
collection of over 4,000 samples

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.450
and then split that
amongst institutions

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:03.190
to really promote collaborative
research and the Library

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:06.390
of Congress was lucky
enough to be a recipient

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.440
of Forbes pigment collection
and that's now housed

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.290
in the conservation division.

00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:12.780
And so, various types of
analysis could be done

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:15.330
on these pigments by
participating institutions

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.550
and now that analysis is
stored in an online portal

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:22.040
and then shared
cross-institutionally.

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.160
So, you'll see parallels as we
go through between that type

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.070
of the Forbes reference
collection and these books

00:10:29.070 --> 00:10:31.560
because while we aren't going

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.080
to share these books
cross-institutionally,

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.400
they're not so rare
that they already

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.200
exist cross-institutionally.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.500
And so, if we can
start to catalog them

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:44.630
and share our analysis
and our observations,

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:49.970
we have a disperse
reference collection already.

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:53.410
So, as photography
became more valued.

00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:56.990
I'm just going to check my time

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.080
because I could just
go on all day.

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:02.270
As it became more valued,
gaps in our knowledge

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.520
about the technical
history were revealed

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.720
and more demanding
questions were asked

00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:09.880
of conservators regarding
image making and technique.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.920
And so, forgeries
such as this scandal

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.060
of posthumously printed Lewis
Hine photographs emerged

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.440
and conservators were really
on the forefront of responding

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:24.340
to these questions of
when was this print made,

00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:26.640
was it really made
by this person.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.720
And one of these conservators
was named Paul [inaudible].

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.020
I shouldn't say was,
he's still alive.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:32.320
[ Background noise ]

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:33.620
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
He's now the director

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.810
of the lens media lab
at Yale and he began

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:41.030
to build a reference
collection on silver,

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.850
20th century silver gelatin
papers and he wanted to be able

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.850
to look at that reference
collection and really study it

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:53.230
for the paper making fibers
that were used at the time,

00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:57.090
the paper thickness, optical
brightening dyes and all

00:11:57.090 --> 00:12:01.860
of this aided in the conclusion
that those Lew Hine prints

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.600
that we saw were
actually not printed,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.300
could not have been printed
during his life time.

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.140
So, here's these.

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:10.680
Paul gave me these slides.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:13.020
He grew this reference
collection

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:19.210
in this obsessive eBay buying
spree where he just kind

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:24.380
of lost his mind and
he made this incredible

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.680
reference collection.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.980
So, what. So, it's great.

00:12:27.980 --> 00:12:32.950
I mean, don't get me wrong,
but as things became earlier,

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:35.250
he couldn't find
them on eBay anymore.

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:38.900
So, what we find with his
collection is that there's not,

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:42.000
there are not any
samples that predate 1900.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.180
But, where does the 19th century
reference collection exist

00:12:46.180 --> 00:12:47.480
for photography?

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.500
And I would argue that, that
19th century collection exists

00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.540
in these photographic
technical manuals.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.010
So. So. Okay.

00:13:00.010 --> 00:13:02.900
So, then I decided
let's do a pilot project

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.620
and really show the potential
of what we can unleash

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.110
if we catalogue these samples.

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:13.490
So, with the help of a junior
fellow that I had for 10 weeks,

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.450
we looked at, we
catalogued 1,500 samples

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:21.220
from the collection and Paul
[inaudible] built this database

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:27.370
and then the fellow put all
of the samples in and we.

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:29.380
Okay. So, here's your database

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.870
and you can see we
capture information all

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.230
about the specimen,
not only an image of it

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.740
but where it's located
in what book, the date,

00:13:37.740 --> 00:13:40.860
any manufacturing info,
if it has a recipe

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.410
that accompanies it, if
it has an advertisement

00:13:44.410 --> 00:13:47.410
that accompanies it and then
we can pull up images of all

00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:51.510
of those relevant information.

00:13:51.510 --> 00:13:55.170
From this initial project,
we were able to see

00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:58.380
that samples were
valuable in 3 major ways.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:00.590
They informed us
about rare processes.

00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:04.440
So, processes that you
might never see otherwise.

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.800
They had a wealth of
information on retouching

00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:08.890
and hand coloring materials,

00:14:08.890 --> 00:14:12.300
something that is virtually
undocumented elsewhere.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.550
And then collectively,
the information

00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:18.460
about known manufactured papers
provided us with a wealth

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.230
of knowledge about artists
practice and then larger trends

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:24.270
in marketing and manufacture.

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:28.470
So, those papers provided us
with like a big data approach.

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:31.460
And that's kind of why I call
this talk mapping the genome

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:33.890
of 19th century photography
because just

00:14:33.890 --> 00:14:36.290
like they were doing
with the human genome,

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:38.630
the more you add,
the more you know.

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:41.300
And so, it really is
a big data project.

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:43.900
You have to add more
to get more out of it.

00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.590
And so, this is just
the beginning of that,

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:50.620
but let's take a look
at some of these gifts

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.560
that these books have in them.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.130
First, on rare processes.

00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:56.530
So, this is one of my favorites.

00:14:56.530 --> 00:14:57.930
When I opened this
book and I found this,

00:14:57.930 --> 00:15:00.750
I was like oh my
gosh, it's the best.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:02.280
It's called a nonpareil.

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.580
I had read about.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:05.080
I had never seen one before.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:08.080
So, it was in our
Spanish translation

00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.220
of The Silver Sunbeam
by [inaudible]

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:14.850
which sounds really
cool in Spanish

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:17.490
and this image is
similar to a tin type

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.420
in its final construction.

00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:23.840
So, it's a varnished collodion
image on a coated iron plate.

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.070
So, very similar to a tin type
if you're familiar with that,

00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.900
but the process for making this
image is extremely different

00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:32.980
than that of a tin type.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:37.280
A tin type is a direct positive
image meaning each one is unique

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.860
in the world and you don't
use a negative to make it.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.380
That plate was in the camera
and you get one, right.

00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:48.600
This image was made using
a negative and thus,

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.380
because you had to put
the negative in contact

00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:54.300
with the sensitized paper
or the sensitized plate,

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.360
you couldn't use wet collodion

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:58.440
or the negative would
just stick to it.

00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:01.350
So, you had to use an
alteration called dry collodion

00:16:01.350 --> 00:16:03.940
which is kind of
a rare variation.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:08.260
It. So, what these
actually means in the end is

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.490
that these images
could be reproduced.

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:12.950
So, there could be many of these

00:16:12.950 --> 00:16:16.200
because they were
made with a negative.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.020
These images are extremely
rare and it was a real treat

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.470
to find one of these and I love
how they have the advertisement

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:24.440
too for the plate
and they say it's

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.440
like porcelain and it elicits.

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.740
I love this.

00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:30.960
Like, not a ringing endorsement,
but maybe in the 19th century,

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.560
you didn't want to sound
like really boastful,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:36.390
but they're like, it's elicited
the most general expressions

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.960
of approval and admiration.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.880
Okay. I'm sold.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.230
Sign me up.

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:45.770
Our plates are stamped.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:48.010
Be known, all others
are spurious.

00:16:48.010 --> 00:16:49.710
[ Background noise ]

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:53.410
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: So,
lots of drama going on.

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.260
Another special find in the
collection were these samples

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:03.670
of uranium prints and this one
is out over here by Ernst Leitz

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:08.090
who was the future founder
of Leica camera company.

00:17:08.090 --> 00:17:10.220
These 2 samples show
2 distinctive ways

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:13.160
of making uranium prints,
one using silver nitrate

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:16.710
and then one using
potassium ferricyanide.

00:17:16.710 --> 00:17:18.830
This book not as
rare as some others,

00:17:18.830 --> 00:17:21.380
is found in other collection.

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.180
So, there's one at the
National Gallery of Art.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:30.450
I've seen one at the George
Eastman Museum Library.

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:33.430
So, you see other copies and by,

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.220
by existing in other
collections,

00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.550
it affords us the
opportunity to look at samples

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:42.830
that have been aged in very
different environments.

00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:45.820
So, you imagine these are all
being published on the same date

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:48.350
and the same location and
then they get sent out

00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:50.630
and they live their
lives in different places

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:53.010
and one ended up at Getty.

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.310
Lucky book.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.220
And then one ended up here
at Library of Congress

00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:59.620
and by comparing these,
what we can see is

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.380
that these have been naturally
aged for us and it tells us

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.480
that probably the top process,
it's not fading related

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.830
to environmental conditions,

00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.780
it's fading because there's
inherent vice with this process

00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.080
that causes it to fade.

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.280
So, there's a lot of
wealth that can be gained

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.980
from examining these books.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:22.740
Another one of the
processes that we had

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.390
in these were tin types.

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:26.210
So, like I said before,
if you're not familiar

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.650
with the structure
of them, they're made

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:32.460
on an iron plate that's
coated with a varnish

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.300
and then they have a collodion
layer and then a varnish on top

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.200
of that to protect it.

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:43.360
And we had 7 tin types
found in our books,

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.080
mostly in the Silver Sunbeam

00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.600
and then Eastbrook's
the [inaudible] type

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.470
and how to make it.

00:18:50.470 --> 00:18:53.570
But, while tin types are not
rare, we see them all the time

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:58.560
in antique shops and, you
know, I find them everywhere

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:03.240
in like thrift stores,
but to know what plate,

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.180
what manufacturer
made what plate

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.170
that we find a tin type on,
that's really rare knowledge.

00:19:08.170 --> 00:19:10.930
They usually weren't
marked and so

00:19:10.930 --> 00:19:13.850
to actually have an identified
manufacturer associated

00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:16.910
with a tin type plate
is really unusual.

00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:21.410
And then of course there
are these associated recipes

00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:22.890
that go along with these.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:25.790
And so, even in a small
set of just 7 plates,

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.090
you can start to see patterns.

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:30.870
So, we found 2 plates that had
cracking and then when we looked

00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:33.100
at the recipes for the
plates, we could determine

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.670
that the only ones with
cracking are also the only ones

00:19:36.670 --> 00:19:39.650
that were varnished
with diamond varnish.

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:43.160
So, most likely the cracking
that we're seeing is associated

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.010
with the varnish that was used.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:48.730
So, it's interesting things like
that for the technical history

00:19:48.730 --> 00:19:52.150
for conservators that's
really helpful information.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:55.540
And then like I said.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.030
Oh, and then another
thing that is interesting

00:19:58.030 --> 00:20:00.840
about tin types is since
they're unique and not made

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.010
from negatives, when you're
publishing a book using tin

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:08.080
types and say you have a,
you have 2 tin types per book

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.200
and you're doing a
200-book print run,

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.260
that's 400 tin type
you have to make.

00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.250
You can't make those from
negatives so you're shooting,

00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:23.960
you're shooting 400 hand coated
plates in front of sitters.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.260
No one's going to sit
for 400 portraits.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:29.150
They're going to be like
dead by the end, like.

00:20:29.150 --> 00:20:32.390
So, what you find is that
even though these books are

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:36.770
catalogued as being exactly
the same within institutions,

00:20:36.770 --> 00:20:38.940
in fact the samples vary.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.240
And so, when we talk about
redundancy in collections

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:45.780
and reduction of collections
because of redundancy,

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.920
I think that we need
to actually think

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:50.460
about that a little bit more
and make sure that things

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:54.950
that we're calling redundant
truly are redundant before we

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:58.650
talk about [inaudible]
or things like that.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:02.730
One of the things that we
found that was really great

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.890
and I pulled quite a few samples
over here for to you guys

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:09.830
to look at afterwards are
information on hand coloring.

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:13.410
So, hand coloring of
photographs was popular

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.840
from the Daguerre type all
the way down, you know,

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:19.340
into silver gelatin
and, but knowledge

00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:22.140
of the materials is
actually really rare.

00:21:22.140 --> 00:21:25.840
And so, having these actual
samples allow conservators

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.570
to test pigments at various
time periods to understand

00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:31.060
when something could
have been made,

00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.440
what pigments would be present
and also because of the nature

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.320
of the book format
when it's closed

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:39.490
and it's pushing
all the oxygen out

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:41.250
and it's not letting
air pollutants get in

00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.550
and there's no light exposure.

00:21:42.550 --> 00:21:43.850
[ Background noise ]

00:21:43.850 --> 00:21:45.150
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
A lot of time we find

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:48.630
that these pigments
are preserved as best

00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:49.990
as they could possibly be.

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:52.480
So, some of them look like
they were made yesterday

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.210
which is very rare.

00:21:56.550 --> 00:21:59.750
While all these samples shown
are remarkable on their own,

00:21:59.750 --> 00:22:01.650
for me the most interesting part

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.810
of cataloguing these was
really their collective power

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:08.930
to show us larger trends.

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:15.480
So, we not, fully,
[inaudible] of this data so far

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:17.960
and as we collect more samples,

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.300
it will be more statistically
accurate, but one thing

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:26.020
that we can do in
collecting this data is start

00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:28.890
to map things and chart things.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:33.360
So, like just, this is
just a very basic chart

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:37.500
which shows different processes
over time and so we can start

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.490
to see changes like when
a process is introduced

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:45.490
and when it leaves,
what it's replaced by,

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:52.700
when it was at its peak
or we can just look

00:22:52.700 --> 00:22:55.900
at one process within
the data set.

00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.710
So, this is the salted
paper process.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.430
There's not many sample, we
know it was a very popular

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:03.870
photographic process,

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.600
but it wasn't really
a manufactured

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.130
photographic process.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.140
You would hand make salted
paper prints in the early years.

00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:16.190
So, that's why we only see
occasional mention of it,

00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:20.410
but what this graph does
show is this resurgence

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:24.060
of the salted paper
process in the 1890's

00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.430
which is virtually
undiscussed in the literature

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:28.710
and that resurgence is actually

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.940
on a manufactured paper not
a hand sensitized paper.

00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.900
So, it, this type of work in
cataloguing examples has kind

00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:39.020
of redefined some of
these processes for us

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.550
and given us a much better
understanding of the evolution

00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:46.330
of them throughout time.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:49.150
Here again we see just
silver gelatin paper,

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:52.020
the one that Paul [inaudible]
is obsessively collecting,

00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.160
but can't get our samples
because they're before 1900.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.780
And so, you can see how many
samples we have before 1900

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.870
and we're not even
close to have,

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.590
to have finished
looking at our books.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:08.740
We have thousands and thousands
of more samples to catalogue.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.230
So, I'm sure the silver
gelatin paper section will fill

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:15.690
in considerably and, you know,

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:19.470
we have one of the
earliest samples is 1881

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:20.980
for silver gelatin paper.

00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.620
So, some of these manufacturers
only lasted 1 or 2 years.

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.930
And so, their appearance

00:24:26.930 --> 00:24:30.750
on the market is only
preserved in these manuals.

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:33.310
And then another thing that
kind of was cool to look

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:37.880
at was comparing historic
terms to contemporary terms.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.510
So, just how many terms in
the literature did they have

00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:44.770
for say the collotype
and there was

00:24:44.770 --> 00:24:48.920
so many proprietary
variations of this process

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.180
and they would call it
like [inaudible] process.

00:24:51.180 --> 00:24:53.330
Well, a modern researcher
may not know

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.960
that [inaudible]
process is a collotype.

00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.300
So, this type of information can
provide a new primary resource

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:03.730
from which researchers
can really like delve

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:06.250
into something much more deeply.

00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:12.420
And then you can also with data
of course, start to map things.

00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:16.960
So, this is a map of where the
sample photographs were taken,

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:19.630
but you could also make maps
on where they were manufactured

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:23.640
or where certain processes were
manufactured and you could do

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.050
that over time and see the
development of certain hubs

00:25:27.050 --> 00:25:30.000
of photographer like, you
know, how did Rochester become

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.850
such a center for photographic
development and manufacturing.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.520
So, let's just take one
process and really look at it

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.960
and see what the data tells
us about this one process.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:47.520
So, I chose albumen
prints and for people

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.280
that don't know what those are,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:53.100
they're a photographic print
process, they're on paper

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:55.850
and then they have
an albumen binder

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:58.650
which albumen is
basically egg white

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:01.530
with a silver image material
and here's a really nice picture

00:26:01.530 --> 00:26:07.020
of Walt Whitman from
our collection.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:09.490
So, we call these
albumen prints,

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:11.960
but albumen is kind
of a general term.

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.830
There's so many things that
we would put under that,

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:18.230
but they have very
different properties.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.060
A lot of albumen prints
are mat and some are shiny

00:26:21.060 --> 00:26:23.110
and some have different
image tones,

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:26.010
some age very differently
from other ones.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:27.490
[ Background noise ]

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:29.490
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: There are
some that are died with pink

00:26:29.490 --> 00:26:34.920
or green dyes which changes
the look of the final print,

00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:37.520
but millions of images
were made on albumen paper

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.050
so we should really start

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:42.010
to understand the manufactured
history of this paper.

00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:43.660
Some of the most
well-known photographers

00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:46.260
in history made albumen
prints like Mathew Brady

00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:50.130
or Alexander Gardner
or Gustave Le Gray.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:53.370
When we looked at these books,
we had more albumen samples

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:56.010
than any other process
in the collection.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:27:01.340
So, we had 332 albumen samples.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:06.290
305 of those samples were on
known papers, identified papers,

00:27:06.290 --> 00:27:10.930
and the samples ranged
in a 40-year times span.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:15.380
We had 37 different types
of papers represented

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.140
by 30 different manufactures.

00:27:17.140 --> 00:27:20.290
So, it's an incredible
wealth that were,

00:27:20.290 --> 00:27:23.260
was previously untapped before.

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.080
So, let's just look at this in
the identified papers if we make

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.850
that as whole and
we make a pie chart,

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:33.010
we see that certain
manufacturers were making most

00:27:33.010 --> 00:27:34.310
of those samples.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:38.310
So, this is just, you
can see that E&amp;HT Anthony

00:27:38.310 --> 00:27:41.420
who were making Daguerre types,
now they've moved to albumen

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:44.490
and they've made this
huge amount of samples

00:27:44.490 --> 00:27:48.390
in the collection, but what
I think is actually more

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:53.260
interesting is when you look
at the manufacturers over time

00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:59.900
and you start to see that
in the hay day of albumen,

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:04.430
we have a huge number
of manufacturers.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.350
There's a really
diverse market out there

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:10.390
and then we have 2 years
where there are no samples

00:28:10.390 --> 00:28:14.090
for some reason and then
basically after those 2 years,

00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:16.900
E&amp;HT Anthony has
like taken over.

00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.680
So, I call it egg wars.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:23.220
It's a like a dirty
business, right?

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.820
They're like [inaudible]
through the market and they just

00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:29.680
like corporate takeover and,
you know, I imagine all sort

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.440
of drama, but, but anyways.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:34.740
So, they've taken
over this market now

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.580
and then there's just
a few small players

00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.570
that come in at the end.

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:41.470
And so, I think it tells us
how researchers could start

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:47.250
to use this collective aggregate
of data to kind of see trends

00:28:47.250 --> 00:28:55.060
that they may not have even
realized were happening before.

00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:58.850
So, more data means
better accuracy.

00:28:58.850 --> 00:29:00.620
So, we're trying to
get other institutions

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.080
that have these collections to
participate in this project.

00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:07.340
So, we would provide them
with our empty database

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:11.460
and they could fill it and
then we would take that data

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:15.370
and collect it and then that
data, we're hoping to put online

00:29:15.370 --> 00:29:17.040
through the Library
of Congress site

00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:20.870
and then any researcher
could query that data

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:22.760
in any way that they wanted to.

00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.990
And then just for the last
slide I wanted to kind of sum

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:30.780
up things that I've learned
through doing this project

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.040
and things that I'd
like people to walk away

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:34.760
from if they're working
in libraries

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.340
that have these collections
is kind of the value.

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:46.130
How a lot of times in libraries
we value individual samples.

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:51.710
So, like the rarity of a book
over a lot of times the kind

00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:56.560
of large collections, but
there is this real value

00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.190
in aggregate data that I think
we need to think about more

00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:03.430
and this has a lot to do with
how collections are looking

00:30:03.430 --> 00:30:05.720
at redundancy because for me,

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:08.130
redundancy always
[inaudible] more data, right.

00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:10.530
So, never mind if you
don't enough space,

00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.490
it's more data for me so.

00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:16.720
But also, redundant
like I showed,

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:18.060
redundant may not be redundant.

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.080
And so, I think we need to
pay a lot more attention

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.820
to what we mean when
we say that especially

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:26.910
when we're thinking
about [inaudible].

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.660
I think it's great
for us as librarians

00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:32.020
and conservators imbedded
in collections to think

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.180
about new ways that subject
matter experts imbedded

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:39.000
in collections can
create primary resources

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.110
to encourage new types of
research in the field and just

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:44.410
to remind people

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.430
that digitization doesn't
replace these holdings.

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:48.520
That the value of
these samples is really

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.350
in the materiality of them.

00:30:50.350 --> 00:30:52.480
And so, you can create
a reference image

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.890
and that can be helpful,
but what you really need is

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:58.160
to see this photographs
in real life.

00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:01.170
And then also to send
people out, you know,

00:31:01.170 --> 00:31:02.850
I'm only interested
in photography,

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.550
but there's a whole world out
there of technical manuals

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.930
and they're amazing
technical manuals

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:14.320
that describe the history of
fabrics the history of paper,

00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:18.640
the history of paint,
all these things.

00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:23.150
And so, it would be great if
this kind of provided a model

00:31:23.150 --> 00:31:26.130
for looking at all these other
technical manuals and started

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:29.470
to catalogue them for, you
know, other people's fields too

00:31:29.470 --> 00:31:34.410
because I think they hold a
lot of untouched potential.

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:35.830
And thank you.

00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:37.630
Thanks for coming.

&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
People up here are people

00:31:45.950 --> 00:31:49.670
that really helped with this
project and I especially want

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:53.190
to thank Mark [inaudible]
who, and the staff here

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.880
who really saw that even though
these weren't [inaudible],

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:59.990
they were still worth
collecting and putting

00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:02.300
in the rare book division
which really means a lot.

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:04.550
And we brought sample.

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:07.130
So, you should definitely
take time

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:09.950
and if there's any questions,
I'm happy to answer questions.

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:12.200
&gt;&gt; Adrenne, great talk.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:17.070
I was just wondering what other
collections have large numbers

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:21.730
of these volumes,
like are other?

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:24.640
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
Other institutions?

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.070
Well, you guys do it.

00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:33.300
National Gallery, it's
not large compared to us.

00:32:33.300 --> 00:32:35.870
So, measly collections,
let me think.

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.570
No. The George Eastman museum

00:32:39.570 --> 00:32:41.340
of course has an
incredible collection.

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:44.770
New York Public Library is
actually really interested

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:46.200
in this project.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:49.510
They have a great
collection of these books.

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.940
I'm sure the British Library has
them or Bibliotheca National.

00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:58.410
I haven't contacted
them about yet, but I,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:02.550
I'm sure that there's a lot
more than we probably know

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:05.500
and there's some really
rare things out there.

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:06.800
Yeah.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:09.750
&gt;&gt; We refer to them as
boutique collections.

00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.070
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
Boutique collection.

00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:13.370
I like that.

00:33:13.370 --> 00:33:14.670
That's so PC.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:15.970
Yes.

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:20.680
&gt;&gt; This is not directly
related to the photography,

00:33:20.680 --> 00:33:29.610
but it reminded me of a
seminar in graduate school

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:35.410
when we were searching, we
were dealing with searching

00:33:35.410 --> 00:33:39.510
for the acceptances
[inaudible] scientific theories,

00:33:39.510 --> 00:33:46.970
history of science and
the professor was adamant

00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:53.350
about the value of
retaining old textbooks

00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:02.090
where the defined things
regarding Biology [inaudible]

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:03.390
and Einstein [inaudible].

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.540
So, just wondering
if anyone could speak

00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:09.520
to what the retention policy
the Library of Congress

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.560
for old textbooks of a
more general [inaudible]

00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:13.860
than photography.

00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:17.920
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: I have
no information about that.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:20.540
Does someone else know?

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:21.840
&gt;&gt; I do.

00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:23.610
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Oh, great.

00:34:23.610 --> 00:34:24.910
Yay.

00:34:24.910 --> 00:34:28.180
&gt;&gt; The collection
policy statements

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:36.720
for textbooks basically states
that we only collect textbooks

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:42.720
when they are sort of the best
research value in that subject.

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:47.590
We don't collect, you know,
[inaudible] or those sort

00:34:47.590 --> 00:34:52.970
of basic school textbooks
that we depend

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:55.150
on [inaudible] department

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.650
of education [inaudible]
collections.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:34:57.950
So.

00:34:57.950 --> 00:34:59.250
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Thank you.

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:00.550
Yeah.

00:35:00.550 --> 00:35:05.580
&gt;&gt; Can you say something about
these books that have as objects

00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:09.590
of a, that have a
publishing history.

00:35:09.590 --> 00:35:11.780
Why were they published?

00:35:11.780 --> 00:35:14.070
How were they published?

00:35:14.070 --> 00:35:16.000
How were they distributed?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.430
Did they, were they
promoting something?

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.660
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Well, I
think, I can maybe answer part

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.350
of that which is when
you're doing a process,

00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:32.840
and I actually pulled an
example out of bromoil.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:37.970
So, I have one up there
that's a bromoil book

00:35:37.970 --> 00:35:45.740
and it just has a half tone of
what a bromoil should look like

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:51.110
and then I have a book in
front of it that actually is

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.260
about bromoils and
has bromoils in it.

00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:59.020
And when you're doing
photography and you're trying,

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.430
you're reading about a process
and you've never done it before

00:36:03.430 --> 00:36:09.040
and you maybe have never even
seen it, you need a sample

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:12.950
because you don't know what
you're trying to shoot for

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:14.750
and if you're getting that.

00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:24.370
And so, these were instructional
manuals for a lot people

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.550
and that piece provided
them a reference

00:36:27.550 --> 00:36:29.430
of what they were
trying to achieve, right.

00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:31.870
&gt;&gt; But, not all of
these processes endure.

00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:33.170
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Yeah.

00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:35.170
So, I mean, I think some of
them were trying to get momentum

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:36.850
like the [inaudible],
maybe it never took off.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.670
Dry collodion is a
little bit [inaudible]

00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:45.230
which is why most
people tend to just stay

00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:48.620
with wet collodion I think.

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.530
It wasn't maybe as easy
from what I've heard.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:55.730
So, there may have been
technical difficulties

00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:59.960
with how easy a process was
which is why we have a sample,

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:01.600
but we don't see them that much.

00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:05.840
In the one with the uranium
prints, it was a means

00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.670
to show all of, all of the
processes that one could do

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:08.970
to make copies of
architectural drawings.

00:37:08.970 --> 00:37:10.270
And so, if you look in that
book, there's 10 samples.

00:37:10.270 --> 00:37:11.570
So, it's, it's almost
like a complete look

00:37:11.570 --> 00:37:12.870
at what people could do to make
architectural drawing copies.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.170
So.

00:37:14.170 --> 00:37:15.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I was wondering about
what was the market for this

00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:16.770
and how did people
find out about.

00:37:16.770 --> 00:37:18.070
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Well,
when you look in the ack,

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.370
a lot of times there's
announcements in the backs

00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:20.670
of one book about other
books on the market.

00:37:20.670 --> 00:37:21.970
So, I think that they
were kind of reading.

00:37:21.970 --> 00:37:23.270
If you were interested in
photography, you might subscribe

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.570
to a serial and then
they would review a book

00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:25.870
or they would have
advertisements

00:37:25.870 --> 00:37:27.170
or often book lists and
I've used those book lists

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:28.470
to find things in collections
because they are so helpful.

00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:29.770
Yeah, I don't think
the market was huge.

00:37:29.770 --> 00:37:31.070
I don't know.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:32.370
I mean, some books more than
others maybe, but I think,

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:33.670
you know, making the tin
type and how to make it

00:37:33.670 --> 00:37:34.970
and you're making 2 tin types.

00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:36.270
I can't imagine your print will
run with being more than 200.

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:37.570
I mean, just seems crazy
to have to even make that.

00:37:37.570 --> 00:37:38.870
So, yeah, I don't know exactly.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:40.170
Yeah.

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.470
[ Background noise ]

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:42.770
&gt;&gt; This gets to the issue
of the manufacturer.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:44.070
I'm researching a
biographical subject who happens

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:45.370
to have been a woman during the
globetrotting era who traveled

00:37:45.370 --> 00:37:48.670
in the far east, did a lot
of her own photography.

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:52.870
So, I'm hearing here that
there are a lot of variables.

00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:58.400
How much technical proficiency
would have been required

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:02.600
for somebody who is
traveling the world,

00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:04.700
you know, carrying equipment.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.000
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: It depends

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.800
on what process you're
using honestly.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:12.190
I mean, some processes are
much easier than others

00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:16.160
and some are very sensitive
to like heat and humidity.

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.000
So, if you're going somewhere
like India and you're trying

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.140
to do the, you know,
paper negative process,

00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.900
that's a tricky process.

00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.130
You've got to be
really accomplished,

00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:29.430
but if you're trying

00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:32.680
to do gelatin dry plate,
that's much easier.

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:34.140
So, it really depends.

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:37.510
Yeah. Yes.

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:38.810
Hi.

00:38:38.810 --> 00:38:41.960
&gt;&gt; Great talk.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:48.830
I have 2 questions.

00:38:48.830 --> 00:38:51.590
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Sure.

00:38:51.590 --> 00:39:01.300
&gt;&gt; First I was, I am
surprised that these are

00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:05.190
in the rare book collection,
that's like really great

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:09.580
and are there other
collections in the library

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:15.530
that are holding these
types of materials

00:39:15.530 --> 00:39:18.090
and I was also wondering
if you could say more

00:39:18.090 --> 00:39:20.410
about the technical analysis

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:23.380
that you're doing
on the reference.

00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:24.680
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Sure.

00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.540
So, I should say we've only
transferred the most rare

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:30.160
of these books to rare book.

00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:38.270
Most of the 78,000 books, not
all of them contain samples.

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:45.280
I would say the 5 to 10%
maybe contain samples.

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.870
Those are in general
collections,

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:51.620
but now we've marked them as
special materials and those now,

00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:54.660
before they could be checked
out to someone's desk,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:58.910
now you actually have
to be in a reading room

00:39:58.910 --> 00:40:00.660
to get access to
those materials.

00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:07.950
So, I feel like that was a big
accomplishment of this project,

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:11.420
was just to draw
attention to that.

00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.920
We haven't done a huge amount of
technical analysis with these.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.170
Like, XRF, I think,
actually think

00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:22.260
that for the national
gallery, an XRF was run

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:25.310
by your department
on one of these

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:30.330
and that would be [inaudible]
into the kind of data part,

00:40:30.330 --> 00:40:34.590
but we've put that into
the database hoping

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:39.740
that this cross-institutional
collaboration will start

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.840
to take off and that if
someone runs a sample.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.930
I think you guys
ran an [inaudible]

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.790
with the silver gelatin
or silver paper

00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:53.290
that was toned with
platinum salts.

00:40:53.290 --> 00:40:56.900
So, that we've run that, now
that someone else who has

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.720
that sample won't
have to run it,

00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:01.760
but they'll know
that information.

00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.450
That's what I would love to see.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:06.270
Kind of like the Forbes
collection so we don't have

00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:08.920
to like reinvent the
wheel every time.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.220
Yeah. Hi.

00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:14.560
&gt;&gt; One of the reason, some of
the reasoning behind taking them

00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:18.290
into rare is that
we're interested

00:41:18.290 --> 00:41:21.310
in documenting the
[inaudible] period of each

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:28.400
of these processes whether it
be printing with movable type

00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:31.530
or whether it be
[inaudible] and we viewed this

00:41:31.530 --> 00:41:34.500
as another [inaudible]
in book form.

00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:41.330
If they had been in paper
form or loose-leaf form,

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:46.560
they probably would have
gone to another division,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.940
but since they're
documenting the origins

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:55.390
of the photographic book,
it makes perfect sense

00:41:55.390 --> 00:42:00.250
that we would take them
in especially the ones

00:42:00.250 --> 00:42:03.080
that are contained
original materials.

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.300
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Yeah and I
really tried to focus on things

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.210
that didn't exist widely
in other collections

00:42:07.210 --> 00:42:09.680
and also things that
documented kind of the first

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.980
of something for them.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:12.280
Yeah. [inaudible]
in photobooks here.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.580
Yeah. Hi.

00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:14.880
&gt;&gt; We talked at one time about
the series and the samples

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.180
in the series [inaudible].

00:42:16.180 --> 00:42:17.480
I'm just wondering in terms
of serials, how many you found

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.780
and also if you found anywhere
there should have been a sample

00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.080
and it was missing.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.380
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN:
Oh sure, yeah.

00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.680
Which is why I was so concerned
about really limiting access

00:42:22.680 --> 00:42:23.980
to these in an environment that
was controlled because a lot

00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.280
of times, like the
Philadelphia Photographer.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.580
So, about serials, many of the
samples are housed in serials.

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.880
I would say 90% of the
samples are housed in something

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.180
that came out month and each
month you would get a sample.

00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.480
So, like the Philadelphia
photographer,

00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:31.780
every single month you
would get a sample.

00:42:31.780 --> 00:42:33.080
Up until about, which
just a tidbit,

00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.380
but 1895 I think the
postal rules changed

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:35.680
and they started
charging you a lot more

00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:36.980
if you put a sample in there.

00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:38.280
So, then you see a real decrease
in the amount of samples

00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.580
that happened, but yeah, serials
are really the source for a lot

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.880
of these and I know there should
be one every month and I'll go

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.180
and look and samples
will be missing.

00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.480
And sometimes they were made
by really famous photographers,

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.780
civil war photographers,
important people.

00:42:44.780 --> 00:42:46.080
So, I think that's why they've
gone missing [inaudible].

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.380
[ Background noise ]

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:48.680
&gt;&gt; So, is that one of the
things you also want to capture

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.980
in the database where there
is a sample that's supposed

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.720
to be there isn't in ours,
but is in somebody else's.

00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.380
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: We
don't capture anything

00:42:55.380 --> 00:42:57.060
in ours that's missing.

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:01.710
We don't, but as people
add, we will start to see

00:43:01.710 --> 00:43:06.930
that would have had one, that
there would have been one

00:43:06.930 --> 00:43:08.670
for that month and in some
[inaudible] it's there

00:43:08.670 --> 00:43:10.130
and some [inaudible], it's not.

00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:13.030
The interesting thing though
is too is that you can't rely

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:18.710
on the fact that in June
of 1864, this is the sample

00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:20.970
because it may not be the
sample that's [inaudible].

00:43:20.970 --> 00:43:22.490
It could be something different.

00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:24.260
Yeah. Right.

00:43:24.260 --> 00:43:28.140
&gt;&gt; But, just that there
actually is a sample that exists

00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.000
as opposed to [inaudible].

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.300
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Yeah.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.390
I mean, we're only documenting
things that still exist.

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:39.430
Yeah. Oh. Yeah.

00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:41.850
&gt;&gt; The big data [inaudible]
you're taking seems

00:43:41.850 --> 00:43:47.590
to be surfacing aspects
of the history

00:43:47.590 --> 00:43:49.940
that are purely technical.

00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.290
The remark you made
about, with albumen paper.

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:55.500
There's this break and then
suddenly there's a monopoly

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:59.440
and as Mark said, you're
looking at the [inaudible],

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.080
the cradle of this
new technology.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:05.180
That's a significant thing and
there might be a, you know,

00:44:05.180 --> 00:44:07.450
there might be a
[inaudible] book in there.

00:44:07.450 --> 00:44:10.040
What was it that
happened ack then.

00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.630
So, I find that interesting.

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:13.670
I wonder if you have
any examples of that,

00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:16.160
but you also mentioned
that the diamond process.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.460
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Yeah.

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:18.760
The diamond varnish.

00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.060
&gt;&gt; The diamond varnish
resulted in a certain type

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:22.320
of cracking on the item.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:26.060
Are you finding that those
revelations are informing the

00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:28.390
sort of diagnostic
conservation process?

00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:30.120
That if this is a new kind of,

00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:32.430
[inaudible] way to
look for cracks.

00:44:32.430 --> 00:44:35.160
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: I think
we will as we get more data in,

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.840
we'll be able to say okay,

00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.190
now we know that this
diamond varnish is a problem

00:44:42.190 --> 00:44:46.930
and we have a tin type by
so and so that has cracking.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:49.100
Let's test the one with
the diamond varnish and see

00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.720
if we can characterize
that varnish

00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.910
and now let's test
this tin type.

00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:57.510
Do we see the same varnish,
like same finger print

00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:58.810
for that material there?

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:01.230
And then maybe we can start
to draw those parallels,

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:05.850
but we're in the infant stage
as of yet, but that's the goal.

00:45:05.850 --> 00:45:09.250
That these collections will
reveal all these things

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:12.360
about collections that
we really care about,

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.720
things that were really
important and really important

00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.690
to safeguard over
for a long term.

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:18.990
So.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:22.460
&gt;&gt; I'd just like to add that
this is a lovely continuum

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.750
of a tradition at the
Library of Congress.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:27.200
When I came into the profession,

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.250
prints and photographs had
published a list of books

00:45:32.250 --> 00:45:35.830
that contained original
photo prints for the nation

00:45:35.830 --> 00:45:38.660
so that university
librarians in particular can go

00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:42.670
through their collections before
all the [inaudible] had been cut

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.550
out of [inaudible]
books before all

00:45:44.550 --> 00:45:50.300
of what's his names studio
book was clipped and destroyed

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.850
and it was, it was, it
came from the expertise

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.280
of the conservators and curators
in prints and photographs

00:45:57.280 --> 00:45:59.440
that informed national
collections

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.830
or nation's collections
to get these things

00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:03.820
in before they disappeared.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:07.070
And this is just one more
step in that process of,

00:46:07.070 --> 00:46:10.660
as an institution that deals
with the material object,

00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:13.860
both curatorially and
in terms of conservation

00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.610
and preservation, this is really
important work for us to do.

00:46:17.610 --> 00:46:18.910
I think.

00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:20.210
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: Thank you.

00:46:20.210 --> 00:46:22.470
I agree. Yes.

00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:24.510
&gt;&gt; Again, a wonderful talk.

00:46:24.510 --> 00:46:27.010
Were these processes patented

00:46:27.010 --> 00:46:30.040
and would the patent
office have had a collection

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.160
or had a collection?

00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:35.970
&gt;&gt; ADRENNE LUNDGREN: So,
many of these were patented.

00:46:35.970 --> 00:46:38.660
There's actually a great
show and publication

00:46:38.660 --> 00:46:41.920
that came out of the Getty.

00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.380
They just did a show on
the early patent office

00:46:47.380 --> 00:46:49.580
and early photographer.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.100
[inaudible], what's
her last name?

00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.790
Anyways. She, if you're
interested in the patent office,

00:46:55.790 --> 00:46:57.350
I mean that show was amazing.

00:46:57.350 --> 00:46:58.650
She gave a talk about it.

00:46:58.650 --> 00:47:05.070
I was blown away, but they did
have samples for certain things.

00:47:05.070 --> 00:47:09.200
Yes, they would have
been sometimes patented.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.340
Sometimes the changes weren't
seen as significant enough

00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:16.750
to warrant a patent so they
would have been rejected

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.930
for a patent anyways, like they
didn't like to patent things

00:47:19.930 --> 00:47:22.020
that were minor changes,
had to involve

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:23.900
like full on, new research.

00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.360
So, I don't know

00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:29.240
if the variation would have
been captured in that realm.

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.790
Yeah. All right.

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:35.510
