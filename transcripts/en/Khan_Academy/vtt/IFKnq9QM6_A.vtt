00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.120
We humans have known,
for thousands of years,

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.341
just looking at our
environment around us,

00:00:05.341 --> 00:00:06.840
that there are
different substances.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.600
And these different
substances tend

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.120
to have different properties.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.470
And not only do they have
different properties,

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.400
one might reflect
light in a certain way,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.230
or not reflect light, or
be a certain color, or at

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.390
a certain temperature, be
liquid or gas, or be a solid.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.290
But we also start
to observe how they

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.030
react with each other in
certain circumstances.

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:27.410
And here's pictures of
some of these substances.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.070
This right here is carbon.

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.650
And this is in
its graphite form.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.910
This right here is lead.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.030
This right here is gold.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750
And all of the ones that I've
shown pictures of, here--

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.720
and I got them all from this
website, right over there--

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.460
all of these are in
their solid form.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.830
But we also know that
it looks like there's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.240
certain types of air, and
certain types of air particles.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.090
And depending on what
type of air particles

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.590
you're looking at, whether it
is carbon or oxygen or nitrogen,

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.790
that seems to have different
types of properties.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:59.666
Or there are other things
that can be liquid.

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:01.665
Or even if you raise the
temperature high enough

00:01:01.665 --> 00:01:02.360
on these things.

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.485
You could, if you raise
the temperature high enough

00:01:04.485 --> 00:01:06.440
on gold or lead, you
could get a liquid.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.360
Or if you, kind of, if
you burn this carbon,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.020
you can get it to
a gaseous state.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.690
You can release it
into the atmosphere.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.880
You can break its structure.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.530
So these are things that we've
all, kind of, that humanity

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.000
has observed for
thousands of years.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.530
But it leads to a
natural question

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.420
that used to be a
philosophical question.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.790
But now we can answer
it a little bit better.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.320
And that question is, if you
keep breaking down this carbon,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.970
into smaller and
smaller chunks, is there

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.930
some smallest chunk, some
smallest unit, of this stuff,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.314
of this substance, that still
has the properties of carbon?

00:01:43.314 --> 00:01:44.730
And if you were
to, somehow, break

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.271
that even further,
somehow, you would

00:01:46.271 --> 00:01:48.270
lose the properties
of the carbon.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.380
And the answer is, there is.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.030
And so just to get
our terminology,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.940
we call these
different substances--

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.070
these pure substances that
have these specific properties

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.960
at certain
temperatures and react

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.020
in certain ways-- we
call them elements.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.470
Carbon is an element.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:07.570
Lead is an element.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:08.910
Gold is an element.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.949
You might say that
water is an element.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:13.827
And in history, people
have referred to water

00:02:13.827 --> 00:02:14.410
as an element.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.250
But now we know that water is
made up of more basic elements.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.100
It's made of oxygen
and of hydrogen.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.120
And all of our elements
are listed here

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.830
in the Periodic
Table of Elements.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.450
C stands for carbon-- I'm just
going through the ones that

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.280
are very relevant to humanity,
but over time, you'll

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.710
probably familiarize
yourself with all of these.

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:36.610
This is oxygen.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.020
This is nitrogen.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.140
This is silicon.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.090
Au is gold.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.280
This is lead.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.380
And that most basic unit, of any
of these elements, is the atom.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.050
So if you were to keep
digging in, and keep

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.940
taking smaller and
smaller chunks of this,

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.739
eventually, you would
get to a carbon atom.

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.530
Do the same thing over
here, eventually you

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.616
would get to a gold atom.

00:03:02.616 --> 00:03:04.490
You did the same thing
over here, eventually,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.864
you would get
some-- this little,

00:03:05.864 --> 00:03:08.000
small, for lack of a
better word, particle,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.450
that you would call a lead atom.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.241
And you wouldn't be
able to break that down

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:13.560
anymore and still
call that lead,

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.110
for it to still have
the properties of lead.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.490
And just to give you an idea--
this is really something

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:21.600
that I have trouble
imagining-- is

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.690
that atoms are
unbelievably small, really

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.220
unimaginably small.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.750
So for example, carbon.

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.550
My hair is also
made out of carbon.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.320
In fact, most of me
is made out of carbon.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.690
In fact, most of all living
things are made out of carbon.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.840
And so if you took my hair--
and so my hair is carbon,

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.262
my hair is mostly carbon.

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:43.970
So if you took my
hair-- right over here,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.075
my hair isn't yellow,
but it contrasts nicely

00:03:46.075 --> 00:03:46.700
with the black.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.280
My hair is black,
but if I did that,

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.270
you wouldn't be able to
see it on the screen.

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.769
But if you took my
hair, here, and I

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.820
were to ask you, how many
carbon atoms wide is my hair?

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.870
So, if you took a cross
section of my hair, not

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:00.040
the length, the
width of my hair,

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.384
and said, how many carbon
atoms wide is that?

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:04.800
And you might
guess, oh, you know,

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.540
Sal already told me
they're very small.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.016
So maybe there's 1,000 carbon
atoms there, or 10,000,

00:04:10.016 --> 00:04:10.780
or 100,000.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.000
I would say, no.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.540
There are 1 million
carbon atoms,

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.579
or you could string 1
million carbon atoms

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.314
across the width of
the average human hair.

00:04:21.314 --> 00:04:22.730
That's obviously
an approximation.

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:23.970
It's not exactly 1 million.

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.860
But that gives you a sense
of how small an atom is.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.620
You know, pluck a
hair out of your head,

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.300
and just imagine
putting a million things

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.440
next to each other,
across the hair.

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.450
Not the length of the hair,
the width of the hair.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.360
It's even hard to see
the width of a hair,

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.110
and there would be a
million carbon atoms,

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.180
just going along it.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.860
Now it would be pretty
cool, in and of itself,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.840
that we do know that there
is this most basic building

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:54.220
block of carbon, this most basic
building block of any element.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.130
But what's even neater is
that, those basic building

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.570
blocks are related
to each other.

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.400
That a carbon atom is made
up of even more fundamental

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.950
particles.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.671
A gold atom is made up even
more fundamental particles.

00:05:07.671 --> 00:05:09.170
And depending-- and
they're actually

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:12.870
defined by the arrangement of
those fundamental particles.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.430
And if you were to change the
number of fundamental particles

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.430
you have, you could change the
properties of the element, how

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.810
it would react, or you could
even change the element itself.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.480
And just to understand
it a little bit better,

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.260
let's talk about those
fundamental elements.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.365
So you have the proton.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.000
And the proton is actually
the defining-- the number

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.340
of protons in the
nucleus of an atom,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.610
and I'll talk about the
nucleus in a second-- that

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.010
is what defines the element.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:45.702
So this is what
defines an element.

00:05:45.702 --> 00:05:47.660
When you look at the
periodic table right here,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.490
they're actually written
in order of atomic number.

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:52.250
And the atomic
number is, literally,

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.140
just the number of
protons in the element.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.950
So by definition,
hydrogen has one proton,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:03.120
helium has two protons,
carbon has six protons.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.440
You cannot have carbon
with seven protons.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:07.150
If you did, it
would be nitrogen.

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.300
It would not be carbon anymore.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.732
Oxygen has eight protons.

00:06:10.732 --> 00:06:12.940
If, somehow, you were to
add another proton to there,

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:14.680
it wouldn't be oxygen anymore.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.370
It would be fluorine.

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:17.705
So it defines the element.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.450
And the atomic
number, the number

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.549
of protons-- and
remember, that's

00:06:25.549 --> 00:06:27.340
the number that's
written right at the top,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.260
here, for each of these
elements in the periodic table--

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.010
the number of protons is
equal to the atomic number.

00:06:36.705 --> 00:06:38.080
And they put that
number up here,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.160
because that is the defining
characteristic of an element.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.050
The other two constituents
of an atom-- I

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.430
guess we could
call it that way--

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.780
are the electron
and the neutron.

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:57.110
And the model you
can start to build

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.320
in your head-- and this model,
as we go through chemistry,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.690
it'll get a little bit more
abstract and really hard

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.976
to conceptualize.

00:07:04.976 --> 00:07:06.350
But one way to
think about it is,

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.430
you have the protons
and the neutrons that

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:09.850
are at the center of the atom.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:11.710
They're the nucleus of the atom.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:15.060
So for example, carbon,
we know, has six protons.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.660
So one, two, three,
four, five, six.

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:22.420
Carbon-12, which is
a version of carbon,

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.110
will also have six neutrons.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:26.100
You can have versions
of carbon that

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.940
have a different
number of neutrons.

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.330
So the neutrons can change,
the electrons can change,

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:31.830
you can still have
the same element.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.280
The protons can't change.

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.480
You change the protons, you've
got a different element.

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.300
So let me draw a carbon-12
nucleus, one, two, three, four,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.300
five, six.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.450
So this right here is
the nucleus of carbon-12.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:48.910
And sometimes, it'll
be written like this.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:52.720
And sometimes, they'll actually
write the number of protons,

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:53.840
as well.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:56.510
And the reason why we
write it carbon-12--

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:58.830
you know, I counted
out six neutrons--

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:00.760
is that, this is
the total, you could

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:04.206
view this as the total number
of-- one way to view it.

00:08:04.206 --> 00:08:05.580
And we'll get a
little bit nuance

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.370
in the future-- is that this
is the total number of protons

00:08:08.370 --> 00:08:11.870
and neutrons inside
of its nucleus.

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:15.172
And this carbon, by definition,
has an atomic number of six,

00:08:15.172 --> 00:08:16.630
but we can rewrite
it here, just so

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.870
that we can remind ourselves.

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.550
So at the center of a carbon
atom, we have this nucleus.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:25.000
And carbon-12 will have six
protons and six neutrons.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.970
Another version of
carbon, carbon-14,

00:08:26.970 --> 00:08:29.040
will still have six
protons, but then it

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:31.018
would have eight neutrons.

00:08:31.018 --> 00:08:32.559
So the number of
neutrons can change.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:34.950
But this is carbon-12,
right over here.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.990
And if carbon-12 is neutral--
and I'll give a little nuance

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:41.419
on this word in a second
as well-- if it is neutral,

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.890
it'll also have six electrons.

00:08:43.890 --> 00:08:47.690
So let me draw those six
electrons, one, two, three,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.910
four, five, six.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:52.190
And one way-- and this is
maybe the first-order way

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.980
of thinking about
the relationship

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.380
between the electrons
and the nucleus--

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.340
is that you can imagine the
electrons are, kind of, moving

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:02.930
around, buzzing
around this nucleus.

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:04.540
One model is, you
could, kind of,

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.790
thinking of them as
orbiting around the nucleus.

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.050
But that's not quite right.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.460
They don't orbit the
way that a planet, say,

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.710
orbits around the sun.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:13.900
But that's a good
starting point.

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:16.430
Another way is, they're kind
of jumping around the nucleus,

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.680
or they're buzzing
around the nucleus.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:20.680
And that's just
because reality just

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.100
gets very strange at this level.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:24.183
And we'll actually have
to go into quantum physics

00:09:24.183 --> 00:09:26.570
to really understand what
the electron is doing.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.320
But a first mental
model in your head

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.740
is at the center of this
atom, this carbon-12 atom,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:37.000
you have this nucleus,
right over there.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.700
And these electrons are
jumping around this nucleus.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.850
And the reason why these
electrons don't just

00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.360
go off, away from this nucleus.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:47.570
Why they're kind of
bound to this nucleus,

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:49.860
and they form part
of this atom, is

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:54.570
that protons have
a positive charge

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.990
and electrons have
a negative charge.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:01.874
And it's one of these properties
of these fundamental particles.

00:10:01.874 --> 00:10:03.290
And when you start
thinking about,

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:04.690
well, what is a
charge, fundamentally,

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:05.481
other than a label?

00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:07.020
And it starts to
get kind of deep.

00:10:07.020 --> 00:10:08.810
But the one thing
that we know, when

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.670
we talk about
electromagnetic force,

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.280
is that unlike charges
attract each other.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.890
So the best way
to think about it

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:17.100
is, protons and
electrons, because they

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.990
have different charges,
they attract each other.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:21.520
Neutrons are neutral.

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.070
So they're really just sitting
here inside of the nucleus.

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:30.700
And they do affect the
properties, on some level,

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:33.330
for some atoms of
certain elements.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.340
But the reason why we have the
electrons not just flying off

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.970
on their own is
because, they are

00:10:37.970 --> 00:10:42.470
attracted towards the nucleus.

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:45.690
And they also have an
unbelievably high velocity.

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:48.630
It's actually hard for-- and
we start touching, once again,

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.260
on a very strange
part of physics

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.380
once we start talking about what
an electron actually is doing.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.780
But it has enough, I
guess you could say,

00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.690
it's jumping around enough that
it doesn't want to just fall

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:04.520
into the nucleus, I guess is
one way of thinking about it.

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:08.220
And so I mentioned,
carbon-12 right over here,

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:09.820
defined by the
number of protons.

00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.710
Oxygen would be defined
by having eight protons.

00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.420
But once again, electrons can
interact with other electrons.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.140
Or they can be taken
away by other atoms.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:23.380
And that actually forms a lot of
our understanding of chemistry.

00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:26.400
It's based on how many
electrons an atom has,

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:27.860
or a certain element has.

00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.580
And how those electrons
are configured.

00:11:29.580 --> 00:11:33.990
And how the electrons of
other elements are configured.

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:36.490
Or maybe, other atoms
of that same element.

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:41.180
We can start to predict
how an atom of one element

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.360
could react with another
atom of that same element.

00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.700
Or an atom of one element,
how it could react,

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.780
or how it could
bond, or not bond,

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.370
or be attracted, or
repel, another atom

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:52.630
of another element.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:55.230
So for example-- and we'll
learn a lot more about this

00:11:55.230 --> 00:12:00.110
in the future-- it is possible
for another atom, someplace,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.180
to swipe away an
electron from a carbon,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:05.840
just because, for
whatever reason.

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:09.780
And we'll talk about certain
elements, certain neutral atoms

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.360
of certain elements,
have a larger

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.010
affinity for
electrons than others.

00:12:14.010 --> 00:12:17.140
So maybe one of those swipes
an electron away from a carbon,

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.540
and then this carbon
will be having

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.730
less electrons than protons.

00:12:21.730 --> 00:12:25.370
So then it would have five
electrons and six protons.

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.152
And then it would have
a net positive charge.

00:12:28.152 --> 00:12:30.110
So, in this carbon-12,
the first version I did,

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:33.170
I had six protons,
six electrons.

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:34.530
The charges canceled out.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:37.170
If I lose an electron, then
I only have five of these.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.210
And then I would have
a net positive charge.

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.241
And we're going to talk
a lot more about all

00:12:41.241 --> 00:12:42.990
of this throughout the
chemistry playlist.

00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:44.200
But hopefully, you
have an appreciation

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.241
that this is already
starting to get really cool.

00:12:46.241 --> 00:12:48.300
Once we can already
get to this really,

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.937
fundamental building
block, called the atom.

00:12:52.937 --> 00:12:55.520
And what's even neater is that
this fundamental building block

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.800
is built of even more
fundamental building blocks.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.630
And these things
can all be swapped

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:03.160
around, to change the
properties of an atom,

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:05.880
or to even go from an
atom of one element

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.466
to an atom of another element.
