00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.710
One of the most popular and widely consumed
flavors of Thai cuisine is tom yum soup, it's

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.170
a combination of spicy, salty and sour.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.130
Today I'm going to make a recipe for some
of the best homemade Thai tom yum goong soup.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.590
You'll need about one and a half liters of
water, one thumb sized chunk of galangal,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.770
eight kaffir lime leaves, about four stalks
of lemongrass, eight cloves of garlic, two

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:31.800
sweet white onions, three red tomatoes, quarter
kilo of raw shrimp, red or green Thai chillies

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.359
however many you want, a handful bunch of
cilantro, two to three handfuls of mushrooms,

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:43.300
I'm using oyster mushrooms here, and four
to five limes depending on how sour you like

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.071
your soup, two tablespoons of Thai chili paste
known as prik pao, one teaspoon of salt, one

00:00:48.071 --> 00:00:54.200
teaspoon of salt, two tablespoons of sugar,
and about two tablespoons of fish sauce.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.300
The first thing to do is put a pot of water
on the stove and bring it to a boil.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.079
Prepare the galangal by chopping it into thin
slices.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.550
For the lemongrass, all you want to use is
the bottom of the stalks.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.050
Discard the really tough outer leaves and
cut each stalk into 2 - 3 centimeter chunks.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.280
Garlic adds an incredible fragrance to tom
yum gong, so I'm going to use about eight

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.280
cloves, peeled and then sliced.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.310
Next, chop up the two sweet white onions into
large wedges - don't worry they don't need

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.340
to be small.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.680
Cut the three tomatoes exactly the same as
you cut the onions, into large wedges.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.630
For this soup, I'll be using a quarter kilo
of shrimp, mostly for their lovely flavor.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.970
You can use any sort of shrimp but be sure
to divine them first.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.040
Most of the time I use Thai red chillies but
this time I'll be using little green chillies.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.030
Add as many as you want, I'm going make this
pot with about twenty of these little guys.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.730
The next step is to chop up a good handful
of cilantro.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.310
Be sloppy, it doesn't need to be small or
evenly cut.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.010
Next prepare the mushrooms into bite sized
pieces.

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.180
Feel free to use whatever mushrooms you can
find.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.770
Cut the limes and then squeeze the juice into
a separate bowl.

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.579
For this tom yum gong I'll be using about
four to five limes, but I like it pretty sour!

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:15.400
Once the water has come to a light boil, throw
the galangal, lemongrass, garlic, and kaffir

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.590
lime leaves into the pot.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.359
Just crunch the kaffir lime leaves with your
hand.

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:26.150
Immediately add two heaping tablespoons of
roasted prik pao chili paste into the water.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.219
Stir it around and bring the soup to a boil.

00:02:29.219 --> 00:02:35.019
Next, add two tablespoons of sugar and one
teaspoon of salt to the soup and stir that

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:36.730
in.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.050
Let the soup boil for about two minutes and
then add the chopped chillies.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.709
When you've got a rolling boil going on, it's
time to add the shrimp.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:55.610
Then add the mushrooms, the onions and the
tomatoes.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:05.769
Cook the soup for about five more minutes
and then add two tablespoons of fish sauce.

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:13.379
Boil the soup for another two to three minutes
and then add the lime juice.

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.370
Cook it on high heat for about three more
minutes while stirring it quite frequently.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.230
Remember to sample the soup at anytime to
see if it needs any other flavoring ingredients.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.349
You may need to add a little more fish sauce
or lime juice - up to your own preference.

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.170
Finally add the handful of chopped cilantro
to the pot.

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.379
Lightly stir it in and turn off the heat.

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:42.780
Spoon it into a bowl and you've got some best
possible tom yum goong you could ever make!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.590
