And, of course, I am going to quiz you on that.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So what I would like you to do now is to think about

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
what would be a minimum spanning tree for this graph here,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and I would like you to make a check mark in each of the boxes

00:00:13.000 --> 99:59:59.000
that correspond to edges you would put into that minimum spanning tree.
