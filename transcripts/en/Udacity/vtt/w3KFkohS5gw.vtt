00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This question is about Galileo and his experiments on motion.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Now, Galileo loved doing these experiments,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
which is why is has this wonderful giant smile.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
But Galileo didn't have stopwatch.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Instead, he measured time with a water clock.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
A water clock was basically just a giant reservoir of water that he kept filled to the top

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
and that reservoir would leak at a constant rate.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
By measuring the mass of water he collected in a certain time interval,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Galileo could infer how long an object had been moving, let's say rolling or dropping.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Let's define something called a time interval

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and let's say that 1 time interval is the amount of time it takes

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
to fill up this bucket with one gram of water.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Let's say that when Galileo rolls this ball, he finds that in the first time interval

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
in which it's rolling, the ball rolls 0.8 m.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Maybe that means it rolled from here to here.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
What I want you to tell me is how far the ball rolls in the second time interval and in the third.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Now, keep in mind I'm not asking how far it's rolled after two time intervals.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
That would be the sum of the first distance and the second time interval distance.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
I just want to know in the second time interval it rolls from, let's say,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
here to some point on this board or on this plane.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I want you to tell me how big is this distance in the second time interval and in the third.

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
You can enter your answer here and here in meters.
