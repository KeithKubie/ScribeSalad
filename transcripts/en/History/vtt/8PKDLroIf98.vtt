MAN: Let's recycle again.
MAN: [inaudible]

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.240
You good?

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.480
I'm golden.

00:00:07.506 --> 00:00:09.242
MAN: I warned you
not to contact him.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.376
Jesus.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:11.811
Nasry won't talk
to anyone else.

00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:13.146
I run the asset.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.113
MAN: Out of the question.

00:00:14.146 --> 00:00:15.515
I'm not negotiating.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:17.817
I'll forward the
text to the lab.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.819
And I want a legal
finding in writing

00:00:19.852 --> 00:00:21.654
from the president
authorizing the assassination

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.623
of the prince.

00:00:23.656 --> 00:00:25.491
MAN: You're more trouble
than you're worth.

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:28.361
The FSB has your
safehouses pegged.

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:32.165
They don't know my network.

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:33.299
Just trust me.

00:00:33.332 --> 00:00:35.435
MAN: Word just came
in from higher.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.371
We're on the hook for
another shot at Andrew Hall.

00:00:38.404 --> 00:00:39.439
Nasry?

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.507
MAN: Yeah, he contacted the CIA.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.309
Hell just froze over.

00:00:43.342 --> 00:00:45.711
As soon as the OGAs chime in,
I'll let you know, all right?

00:00:45.744 --> 00:00:49.248
Short leashes, no drinking.

00:00:49.281 --> 00:00:52.418
All that [audio out] with
your home lives, do it.

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:53.786
You're not ready.

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:54.720
They're the guys.

00:00:54.753 --> 00:00:56.589
They're loyal.

00:00:56.622 --> 00:00:58.458
They see what they want to see.

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.725
But me, I see things clearly.

00:00:59.758 --> 00:01:01.561
What do you see?

00:01:01.594 --> 00:01:04.597
A selfish prick so desperate
to get back on this team you're

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:06.699
willing to risk all our lives.

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:10.803
MAN: What the hell were you
thinking giving my wife a gun?

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:13.272
It's my family, it's my call.

00:01:13.305 --> 00:01:15.174
Do you understand?

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.543
Do you understand?

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:21.347
You're going to
hit me, hit me.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.882
I understand, Buddha.

00:01:22.915 --> 00:01:25.485
MAN: Thought I'd get
some skulls of my own.

00:01:25.518 --> 00:01:27.320
Figured it's a better way
to keep counting, you know?

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:31.224
We're not keeping score, dude.

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.192
You're victims.

00:01:33.225 --> 00:01:34.360
This guy?

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:35.761
Yeah, he deserved it.

00:01:35.794 --> 00:01:39.165
So did this one; blew
up a school in Peshawar.

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:40.900
But this?

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.335
That's a mom.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.903
Lost her entire family.

00:01:43.936 --> 00:01:48.908
But she came at me with an empty
gun, so I shot her in the face.

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.878
[inaudible] in Harvard,
too late for me.

00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:53.513
But I got to believe
you've got more to life

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:56.382
than making your body a
[audio out] scoreboard.

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:58.851
MAN: What's going on, man?

00:01:58.884 --> 00:02:00.453
I know you.

00:02:03.622 --> 00:02:05.525
[gunfire]

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:09.195
When the whole thing was
over, all of the villagers

00:02:09.228 --> 00:02:11.230
took turns killing this guy.

00:02:11.263 --> 00:02:12.499
[screams]

00:02:13.432 --> 00:02:15.535
With stones.

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.602
Don't do it.

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.471
The kid took his own turn too.

00:02:18.504 --> 00:02:21.908
I joined the SEALs thinking
I could make a difference.

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.544
This kid made me
realize I never will.

00:02:24.577 --> 00:02:26.646
When are you going to
tell them that your head's

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:27.813
going to explode?

00:02:27.846 --> 00:02:30.249
I love you, but
I need this for me.

00:02:30.282 --> 00:02:31.951
I'm sorry.

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:35.421

[non-english speech]

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:40.560
Azerbaijan is filled with
American military advisers.

00:02:40.593 --> 00:02:44.564
I grew up in a village in the
northeast called [inaudible]..

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:47.767
Far away from Uncle
Sam's mercenaries.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.536
There's an old copper mine
there worked by my father

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:51.404
and my father's father.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.639
We'll regroup there.

00:02:53.672 --> 00:02:54.774

ditched the phone.

00:02:54.807 --> 00:02:56.842
MAN: OK, pack your bags.

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.377

WOMAN: Rescuing Hall is
our operational goal.

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:01.948
Then capturing or
killing the prince.

00:03:01.981 --> 00:03:03.449
And what about Nasry?

00:03:03.482 --> 00:03:04.917
You will not kill him.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.419
He's our asset.

00:03:06.452 --> 00:03:07.853
Are we clear?

00:03:07.886 --> 00:03:09.855
We're clear.

00:03:09.888 --> 00:03:12.792

00:03:28.774 --> 00:03:30.309
Sir?

00:03:30.342 --> 00:03:32.712
I have multiple tangos
moving toward delta.

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:34.714
Jesus, it's an ambush.

00:03:34.747 --> 00:03:37.316
[gunfire]

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.318
Get a fire mission
on them, get Golf

00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:40.419
and Hotel back on the ground.

I'm sorry, Bear.

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.666
No worries, brother, OK?
