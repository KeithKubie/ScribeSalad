something that's absolutely normal it
 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370
something that's absolutely normal it
has to deviate from the normal and it

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
has to deviate from the normal and it
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.740
has to deviate from the normal and it
uses some incongruity but that

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750
uses some incongruity but that
 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.570
uses some incongruity but that
incongruity just can't be anything it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580
incongruity just can't be anything it
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.540
incongruity just can't be anything it
has to be appropriate so let me just

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
has to be appropriate so let me just
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.369
has to be appropriate so let me just
give you some really simple examples

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379
give you some really simple examples
 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.160
give you some really simple examples

this incongruity you have a door that's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
this incongruity you have a door that's
 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.090
this incongruity you have a door that's
not a door you have what the interesting

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
not a door you have what the interesting
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100

are the two what's the incongruity there

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:19.260
are the two what's the incongruity there
 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.530
are the two what's the incongruity there
the incongruity is for it wouldn't be

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540
the incongruity is for it wouldn't be
 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.360
the incongruity is for it wouldn't be
funny if you said if he's saying I don't

so the two things that exist what's been

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760
so the two things that exist what's been
 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.460
so the two things that exist what's been
called a cognitive synergy that don't

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470
called a cognitive synergy that don't
 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.860
called a cognitive synergy that don't
completely resolve is the message is

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870
completely resolve is the message is
 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.910
completely resolve is the message is
rude and the form is polite the message

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
rude and the form is polite the message
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.370
rude and the form is polite the message
is rude and the form is polite that's

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170
the cartoon I didn't say no Thursday's
 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.980
the cartoon I didn't say no Thursday's
out how about never I say is never good

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990
out how about never I say is never good
 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.940
out how about never I say is never good
for you it continues that so you so

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950
for you it continues that so you so
 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.170
for you it continues that so you so
you're bringing things together that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180
you're bringing things together that
 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.210
you're bringing things together that
don't usually go together and that can't

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220
don't usually go together and that can't
 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.530
don't usually go together and that can't
logically go together

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540
logically go together
 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.930
logically go together
you can't both be polite and rude you

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940
you can't both be polite and rude you
 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.660
you can't both be polite and rude you
are both in fact being polite and rude

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670
are both in fact being polite and rude
 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.899
are both in fact being polite and rude
so I think we we delight in that and we

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:08.909
so I think we we delight in that and we
 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:11.750
so I think we we delight in that and we
also delight in I mean through jokes we

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760
also delight in I mean through jokes we
 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.000
also delight in I mean through jokes we
delight in these synergies these

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010
delight in these synergies these
 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.089
delight in these synergies these
paradoxes that don't resolve themselves

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099
paradoxes that don't resolve themselves
 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.809
paradoxes that don't resolve themselves
for example I mean you know but we can

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819
for example I mean you know but we can
 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.730
for example I mean you know but we can
make but we make it funny by

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740
make but we make it funny by
 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.320
make but we make it funny by
so bringing in the emotional factor of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330
so bringing in the emotional factor of
 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.510
so bringing in the emotional factor of
people for instance it's a paradox to

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520
people for instance it's a paradox to
 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.480
people for instance it's a paradox to
say this sentence is false but nothing

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490
say this sentence is false but nothing
 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.100
say this sentence is false but nothing
funny about it right this sentence is

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110
funny about it right this sentence is
 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.440
funny about it right this sentence is
false well that's interesting it's false

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450
false well that's interesting it's false
 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.740
false well that's interesting it's false
but it's true but it's false to make it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750
but it's true but it's false to make it
 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.690
but it's true but it's false to make it
funny there's a wonderful Alex Gregory

essential thing now in terms of

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990
essential thing now in terms of
 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.800
essential thing now in terms of
incongruity and by appropriate congruity

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810
incongruity and by appropriate congruity
 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.740
incongruity and by appropriate congruity
it's appropriate but it's not completely

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750
it's appropriate but it's not completely
 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.130
it's appropriate but it's not completely
appropriate to logic I can do that by

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140
appropriate to logic I can do that by
 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.350
appropriate to logic I can do that by
extending the riddle thing the door not

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360
extending the riddle thing the door not
 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.150
extending the riddle thing the door not
a door you know it's ajar okay everyone

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160
a door you know it's ajar okay everyone

Durst and that but how about how about a

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400
Durst and that but how about how about a
 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.450

along a continuum of incongruity where
where there's some resolution I mean it

wouldn't make sense if I said mayonnaise

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320
wouldn't make sense if I said mayonnaise
 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.320
wouldn't make sense if I said mayonnaise
that would certainly be incongruous

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330
that would certainly be incongruous
 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.570
that would certainly be incongruous
right but there's still something there

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580
right but there's still something there
 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.180
right but there's still something there

Tower and the answer because it eats its
young okay now so so that's very very

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630
young okay now so so that's very very
 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.510
