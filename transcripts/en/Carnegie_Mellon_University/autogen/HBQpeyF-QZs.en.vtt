world and who have the ability to look
at any of a hundred different problems

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900
at any of a hundred different problems
 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.930
at any of a hundred different problems
at once and see okay this is the one

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940
at once and see okay this is the one
 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.220

thing that we look for that then
 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.790
thing that we look for that then
obviously really good technical skills

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800
 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.650
oh I mean we have a whole process of the
