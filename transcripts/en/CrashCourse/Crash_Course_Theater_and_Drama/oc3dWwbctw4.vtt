00:00:02.915 --> 00:00:05.545
Hey, there! I'm Mike Rugnetta. This is Crash Course: Theatre,

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.005
and today we're going to be raising the curtain on a form of Japanese theatre

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:12.115
that actually used a curtain. It's Kabuki.

00:00:12.115 --> 00:00:14.855
We're also going to look at Bunraku, an uncannily

00:00:14.855 --> 00:00:18.095
lifelike form of puppet theatre that gained popularity

00:00:18.095 --> 00:00:21.095
at about the same time as Kabuki. Get your hooded narrators

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.960
and your twelve best kimonos ready. It's lights up.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.120
Kabuki developed during the Tokugawa Shogunate,

00:00:35.125 --> 00:00:38.415
a military government that ruled from 1603

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.215
to 1868. After a series of disastrous

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:44.245
civil wars, the government finally achieved peace

00:00:44.245 --> 00:00:46.845
and prosperity, while practicing a strict

00:00:46.845 --> 00:00:49.465
isolationism that allowed native arts

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:52.585
to flourish. But, all that repression needed

00:00:52.585 --> 00:00:55.605
an outlet. Noh just wasn't enough anymore,

00:00:55.605 --> 00:00:57.345
especially now that the new middle class

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:00.835
wanted to go to the theatre, too. So, how did Kabuki begin?

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.975
Oh, hey! It's Lewd Mime. Welcome back, Lewd Mime.

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.020
Haven't seen you since the advent of Liturgical Drama. Around

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.115
1603, a female dancer from the Izumo Grand Shrine

00:01:10.115 --> 00:01:12.635
named Okuni began to perform

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.505
publicly on a makeshift stage in a dry

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:18.395
riverbed in Kyoto. Her programs

00:01:18.395 --> 00:01:21.715
got really popular, and eventually Okuni began mixing dance

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:24.795
with little playlets and occasional cross-dressing

00:01:24.795 --> 00:01:27.815
to create lengthier shows. Courtesans began

00:01:27.815 --> 00:01:30.845
adopting her style and making increasingly elaborate performances

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:33.975
set to the music of the shamisen, a three-stringed

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:36.975
lute-like instrument. These performances included dances,

00:01:36.975 --> 00:01:40.085
jokes, and a lot of sexy costumes with scenes set

00:01:40.115 --> 00:01:43.145
in bath houses, because, I mean, you know, courtesans.

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.055
This style was eventually called the Onna Kabuki,

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:48.565
or Women's Kabuki. An alternate name was

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.775
prostitutes singing and dancing. Even though this was

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:54.605
supposedly a theatre for the emergent middle class, and samurai

00:01:54.605 --> 00:01:57.645
were supposed to be above this kind of thing,

00:01:57.645 --> 00:02:00.355
samurai weren't. Concerned about the corrupting influence,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.940
authorities outlawed women performers

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.980
in 1629. But Kabuki, which means "to tilt,"

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.055
continued. Now restricted to the Red Light District of Edo,

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.725
where it could be regulated. This Red Light

00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.905
District was called Ukiyo, or "The Floating World,"

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:17.975
and it was pretty much the naughty, pre-1990's Times

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:20.785
Square of its day, except, you know, more tea houses.

00:02:20.785 --> 00:02:23.845
Since women could no longer perform, the roles were played by young boys

00:02:23.845 --> 00:02:26.335
who also prostitute themselves

00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:29.095
to samurai. The shogun hated this and

00:02:29.095 --> 00:02:32.025
kept trying to regulate it, so in 1642

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:35.045
men playing women's roles were outlawed. And in

00:02:35.045 --> 00:02:37.225
1648, homosexuality was outlawed.

00:02:37.225 --> 00:02:39.585
And in 1652, all young male

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:42.725
actors were outlawed. It's almost like theatre

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.725
isn't the problem. Anyway, it was at this point

00:02:45.725 --> 00:02:48.715
that a men's Kabuki formed. All the actors were grown

00:02:48.715 --> 00:02:50.965
dudes and, just to make sure

00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.895
they wouldn't attract samurai, laws required

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.905
them to shave their foreheads

00:02:55.905 --> 00:02:58.520
and abstain from making themselves attractive.

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:01.195
Sexy scenes were also vetoed.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.160
Sorry, Lewd Mime. A typical Kabuki program lasted

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.220
twelve hours

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.655
until 1868, when the government passed

00:03:08.655 --> 00:03:11.365
more laws and required that there be an

00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.305
eight hour maximum.

00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:15.395
A performance usually began with a historical drama

00:03:15.395 --> 00:03:18.365
called a Jidaimono, which featured battles and

00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:20.955
samurai. This was followed by a dance, which was

00:03:20.955 --> 00:03:24.045
in turn followed by a "ripped-from-the-headlines" domestic drama, or

00:03:24.045 --> 00:03:26.995
Sewamono, and for dessert: a comic dance.

00:03:26.995 --> 00:03:29.635
The performances were highly physical, with lots of

00:03:29.635 --> 00:03:32.655
stage combat and martial arts. Occasionally,

00:03:32.655 --> 00:03:35.415
actors would stop and hold a pose called a

00:03:35.415 --> 00:03:38.295
Mie, which signaled a heightened moment in the

00:03:38.295 --> 00:03:41.125
narrative. While only women's roles were danced at first,

00:03:41.125 --> 00:03:43.945
eventually dance became so important to the form, that in the

00:03:43.945 --> 00:03:46.685
1700's, choreographers were added

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.825
to Kabuki companies. Now, perhaps you're curious how

00:03:48.825 --> 00:03:51.875
exactly Kabuki differs from Noh, then.

00:03:51.875 --> 00:03:54.795
Well, Kabuki plays are full of plot, spectacle,

00:03:54.795 --> 00:03:57.805
sword fights, mystical creatures, and special effects.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:01.095
They're less concerned with enlightenment, and more about

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:03.715
just having a good time. As theatre professor Peter Arnott wrote,

00:04:03.715 --> 00:04:06.065
"Noh is austere,

00:04:06.065 --> 00:04:08.695
Kabuki flamboyant; Noh ritual,

00:04:08.695 --> 00:04:11.805
Kabuki spectacle; Noh offers

00:04:11.805 --> 00:04:14.735
spiritual consolation, Kabuki physical excitement;

00:04:14.735 --> 00:04:17.235
Noh seeks chaste models,

00:04:17.235 --> 00:04:20.265
Kabuki delights in the eccentric, the extravagant,

00:04:20.265 --> 00:04:23.115
and the willfully perverse; Noh is gentle,

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:26.115
Kabuki cruel; Noh is concerned with the hereafter,

00:04:26.115 --> 00:04:29.155
Kabuki, bound by the here and now." Kabuki may have

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:32.125
been fun, wild, cruel, and contemporary, but actors

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:34.915
took it very seriously. Most Kabuki actors

00:04:34.915 --> 00:04:36.905
were born into the profession,

00:04:36.905 --> 00:04:40.120
training from age six or seven, and not considered mature artists

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.425
until forty. While the

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.515
plays are extravagant, the acting's often very restrained.

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:48.435
As Chikamatsu Monzaemon, the greatest

00:04:48.435 --> 00:04:51.085
and most famous Kabuki playwright, once wrote,

00:04:51.085 --> 00:04:54.115
"Since it is moving when all parts of the art

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:57.115
are controlled by restraint, the stronger

00:04:57.115 --> 00:05:00.075
and firmer the melody and words are,

00:05:00.075 --> 00:05:03.405
the sadder will be the impression created." Actors were

00:05:03.405 --> 00:05:06.345
social outcasts, you are perhaps unsurprised

00:05:06.345 --> 00:05:09.465
to learn. For the most part, they could only marry into other

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:12.105
actor families and were ordered to live

00:05:12.105 --> 00:05:15.075
near the theatres. But acting families

00:05:15.075 --> 00:05:18.285
were famous for their unique Kata, or style.

00:05:18.285 --> 00:05:21.325
And Kabuki actors were the rockstars of their day,

00:05:21.325 --> 00:05:24.125
attracting obsessive fans who lived

00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:27.145
for gossip about their lives and rivalries

00:05:27.145 --> 00:05:30.265
and who would offer them presents on opening night.

00:05:30.265 --> 00:05:33.315
Male actors who played female roles, called Onnagata actors,

00:05:33.315 --> 00:05:36.185
were especially popular. A lot of them lived as women,

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:39.425
even off stage, which is very method.

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.175
If an Onnagata threw a used towel into the crowd,

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180
it could cause a riot.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.120
In Kabuki, there are a few basic types of roles: the Onnagata;

00:05:48.125 --> 00:05:51.345
Tachiyaku, brave hero types; Katakiyaku, mean

00:05:51.345 --> 00:05:54.385
villain types; and Koyaku, children's roles.

00:05:54.385 --> 00:05:57.445
Unlike Noh actors, Kabuki actors don't wear

00:05:57.445 --> 00:06:00.305
masks, but each character type has specific

00:06:00.305 --> 00:06:03.085
makeup associated with it. Actors start by

00:06:03.085 --> 00:06:06.180
painting their faces with a white base, and then they add red

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.620
and black, with blue and brown

00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:11.280
if you happened to be playing a demon. Onnagata actors draw on

00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:14.245
fake eyebrows, and if they're playing married women,

00:06:14.245 --> 00:06:17.345
they blacken their teeth. The costumes are elaborate

00:06:17.345 --> 00:06:20.385
and can weigh as much as 50 pounds.

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:23.305
Onnagata playing court ladies wore twelve

00:06:23.305 --> 00:06:26.495
kimonos, one after the other. But because actors

00:06:26.495 --> 00:06:28.335
were outcasts, and the shogunate had

00:06:28.645 --> 00:06:29.995
a lot of laws,

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.960
actors could actually be jailed if their costumes were too nice.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.335
The Kabuki stage was somewhat different from the Noh stage.

00:06:36.335 --> 00:06:39.435
It was wider, extending the full width of the auditorium,

00:06:39.435 --> 00:06:41.895
and at some point, a curtain was added.

00:06:41.895 --> 00:06:45.035
It was also built for exciting special effects and quick

00:06:45.035 --> 00:06:47.995
scene changes, used elevator traps,

00:06:47.995 --> 00:06:51.135
and the stage revolved on a turntable. The biggest difference

00:06:51.135 --> 00:06:54.025
was the Hanamichi, or "Flower Way," a runway

00:06:54.025 --> 00:06:56.295
that ran from the back of the theater right

00:06:56.295 --> 00:06:58.965
up to the stage and allowed the actors to walk

00:06:58.965 --> 00:07:00.245
through the audience.

00:07:00.575 --> 00:07:03.445
This was the 18th Century equivalent of 3D,

00:07:03.445 --> 00:07:06.165
and fans loved it so much that some theaters

00:07:06.165 --> 00:07:09.255
added a second Hanamichi. Kabuki was a literary

00:07:09.255 --> 00:07:12.275
form, though the script was usually secondary

00:07:12.275 --> 00:07:15.365
to the acting, and actors were encouraged to

00:07:15.365 --> 00:07:18.395
improvise. Unlike Noh, most early Kabuki plays were set

00:07:18.395 --> 00:07:21.615
in the present, and a lot of them took place in the Ukiyo,

00:07:21.615 --> 00:07:24.865
"the floating world of smut," the same place you would go

00:07:24.865 --> 00:07:27.765
to see these plays. A narrator was present onstage,

00:07:27.765 --> 00:07:30.875
and sometimes the actors would speak their own dialogue,

00:07:30.875 --> 00:07:33.405
but often the narrator would do it.

00:07:33.405 --> 00:07:36.465
We're going to look at one of these plays, but first we're going to look at Bunraku,

00:07:36.465 --> 00:07:38.875
the puppet theatre, which developed around

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:41.865
the same time as Kabuki. The two forms often

00:07:41.865 --> 00:07:44.915
influenced each other. Initially, these puppets were just heads.

00:07:44.915 --> 00:07:47.905
No, yeah, but, like, with eyes and

00:07:47.905 --> 00:07:50.745
hair and skin and stuff.

00:07:50.745 --> 00:07:54.065
Eventually, the heads grew hands and feet, and then, someone was like,

00:07:54.125 --> 00:07:56.975
"Let's go nuts, and give them bodies."

00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:00.115
The more sophisticated puppets also have moving eyes and eyebrows,

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.140
and in action, Bunraku is some uncanny

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.140
valley stuff. Ugh!

00:08:04.685 --> 00:08:05.685
God!

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:08.995
Stop staring at me! Puppet theatre stages were big,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.040
thirty-six feet by twenty-three feet

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.280
and also pretty innovative.

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.960
Like Kabuki theatres, they had elevator traps to move props and scenery on

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:21.140
and off stage. As in Kabuki, an announcer hooded

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.300
in black told the story. Three puppeteers manipulated

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.285
each puppet. By the 1730's, the puppets were about

00:08:27.285 --> 00:08:30.340
four feet tall. One puppeteer controlled the head

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:34.360
and the right arm, one the left arm, and one the feet.

00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:36.420
If you were a puppeteer, you had to

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.460
spend ten years doing the feet

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:41.920
and then ten on the hand

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:44.555
before they'd even let you touch the head.

00:08:44.555 --> 00:08:47.545
In case you hadn't picked up on the trend, Japanese theatre

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:50.585
doesn't mess around. The most famous of the Bunraku

00:08:50.585 --> 00:08:51.585
playwrights was

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.295
Chikamatsu Monzaemon, who you may remember

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.720
was also the most popular Kabuki playwright.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.980
He's often called the "Japanese Shakespeare," but did

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.500
Shakespeare master the puppet arts?

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.505
He did not. Take that, Billiam.

00:09:04.505 --> 00:09:07.205
Chikamatsu liked to pull sensational plots from the newspapers

00:09:07.205 --> 00:09:10.365
and then dramatize them, especially love suicide plays.

00:09:10.375 --> 00:09:13.365
Basically these do what they say on the tin:

00:09:13.365 --> 00:09:16.300
it's a whole genre of plays about forbidden love that end

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.100
in death. They were eventually banned as

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.215
"too sensational" and too likely to inspire copycat suicides.

00:09:22.215 --> 00:09:24.875
The following 1703 play is a domestic

00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:27.635
tragedy based on an actual event:

00:09:27.635 --> 00:09:30.825
the double suicide of Tokubei, a dealer in soy sauce,

00:09:30.825 --> 00:09:33.860
and Ohatsu, a courtesan. Now, maybe you're thinking

00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:36.920
that the death of a soy sauce salesman doesn't sound that

00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.955
tragic, but let's remember that the audience was full

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.880
of soy guys, and this really happened.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.805
Help us out, Thought Bubble. Tokubei loves Ohatsu, but he's being

00:09:46.805 --> 00:09:49.920
pressured to marry the boss' daughter, and his mom

00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:52.855
has accepted the dowry. "It's a miracle

00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:54.555
I'm still alive.

00:09:54.935 --> 00:09:57.745
If they make my story into a three-act play,

00:09:57.745 --> 00:10:00.620
I'm sure the audience will weep," he says.

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.855
Nice, Tokubei. So, Tokubei manages to get

00:10:03.855 --> 00:10:06.965
the dowry money back, but because he's not the smartest,

00:10:06.965 --> 00:10:09.800
he lends it to his friend Kuheiji. And when he's like,

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.840
"Kuheiji, I need that money back!" Kuheiji's all,

00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.835
"What money? You forged that IOU, and also

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.400
I think you stole my wallet."

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:22.075
Tokubei is like, "Well now I have to marry the boss' daughter for real,

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:24.480
but also I'm dishonored, and I'll never be able

00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:27.940
to see Ohatsu again. Guess my only choice is to kill myself."

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.520
And Ohatsu is like, "Same."

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.115
Oh, and by the way, this is a conversation they have

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:36.205
just with their feet, while Tokubei is hiding under Ohatsu's skirt.

00:10:36.205 --> 00:10:39.155
Tokubei spends the night under the porch of Ohatsu's

00:10:39.155 --> 00:10:42.245
brothel. Just before morning, the couple put on death

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:45.285
clothes, go to the Sonezaki Shrine, where they

00:10:45.285 --> 00:10:48.195
listen to late-night revelers in the tea house

00:10:48.195 --> 00:10:51.185
across the river, and sing a song about love suicide.

00:10:51.185 --> 00:10:53.205
Again, subtle.

00:10:53.625 --> 00:10:55.735
They have a kind of marriage ceremony,

00:10:55.735 --> 00:10:58.865
and tie themselves to a tree. Tokubei slits

00:10:58.865 --> 00:11:00.095
Ohatsu's throat

00:11:00.495 --> 00:11:03.475
and then his own. The narrator tells us that their story whispers

00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:06.695
through the Sonezaki wood and today, high and low

00:11:06.695 --> 00:11:09.675
alike gather to pray for these two lovers who,

00:11:09.675 --> 00:11:12.355
beyond a doubt, will in the future

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.980
attain Buddhahood. They have become models of true love.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.860
Thank you, Thought Bubble!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:19.915
Have they, though? Buddhahood aside,

00:11:19.915 --> 00:11:22.735
you can see how different this feels from Noh.

00:11:22.735 --> 00:11:25.625
It's swift, it's contemporary, it's full of plot.

00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:28.635
It's far more emotional than philosophical, and there's a lot to cry about.

00:11:28.635 --> 00:11:31.825
The excitement of these plays may explain why Kabuki

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:35.195
is still being performed today. Bunraku, too.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:38.175
There's hope for you yet! Next time, we're going to investigate

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.260
another form of Eastern dance drama:

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.220
the Southeast Asian, party-all-night, kill the demon

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.660
form called Kathakali. But until then,

00:11:46.985 --> 00:11:49.565
curtain! And, maybe a haircut.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.380
PBS Digital Studios is conducting its annual audience survey.

00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.500
This survey is one of the most important projects we do every year

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.760
because it helps us understand who you are and what you like and don't like

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.320
beyond what we can see in Analytics.

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:06.820
Thirty-five thousand responses last year helped us make decisions on

00:12:06.825 --> 00:12:09.920
what experiments to try and even what shows to make.

00:12:10.055 --> 00:12:13.275
If you have a few minutes, please click the link. Twenty-five random

00:12:13.275 --> 00:12:16.445
participants will receive an awesome PBS Digital Studios

00:12:16.445 --> 00:12:17.445
t-shirt.

00:12:17.795 --> 00:12:20.885
Crash Course Theater is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.

00:12:20.925 --> 00:12:23.175

00:12:35.125 --> 00:12:37.885
