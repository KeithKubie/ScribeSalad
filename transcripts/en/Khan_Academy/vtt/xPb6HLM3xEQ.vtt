00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.560
Let's keep doing the first
problem from the 2008

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.030
Calculus BC exam.

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.400
We're on Part b.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.640
I think that's too thick.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.970
OK it says, the horizontal line
y equals negative 2 splits

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.460
the region r-- this is
r-- into two parts.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.340
Write, but do not evaluate, an
integral expression for the

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.780
area of the part of r that is
below the horizontal lines.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.980
Let's draw y is equal
to negative 2.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.500
So y equals negative 2
would look like this.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.460
y is just a constant.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.350
That's not thick enough.

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.300
I don't know if
you can see that.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.190
Let me do it as a thick line
and in a darker color maybe.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.300
y is equal to negative 2 will
look something like that.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.740
And what they're saying is if
it splits this region r into

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.550
two parts, this part
and this part.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.260
And what they want to know is
an integral expression for the

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.250
area of the part of r that is
below the horizontal line.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.670
So they care about the
area of this part of r.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.570
And remember they just want
us to write the expression,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.600
not evaluate it.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.470
So that'll hopefully
save us time.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.880
So how do we figure this out?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.480
Well the easy part is actually
to figure out what the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.600
expression we're going to take
the definite integral of.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.250
And it's going to be a little
bit harder to figure out

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.570
the boundary points.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.510
So what is the expression
within the definite

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.510
integral that we will use?

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.290
Well, just like we did in Part
a, think about we're going to

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.600
take a sum of a bunch
of rectangles.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.530
And the height of the
rectangles is going to be

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.795
the difference between
the two functions.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.330
And this is y is equal to
negative 2, and then this

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.680
function right here is y is
equal to-- and we had written

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.680
it down in Part 3-- but
that's x cubed minus 4x.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.310
That's this curve right here.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.780
So the height of each of these
little rectangles is going to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:10.480
be minus 2 minus x to
the third minus 4x.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.150
That's the height of each
of these rectangles.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.630
And then the width of each of
those rectangles we know from--

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.760
well, just learning calculus or
learning integrals--

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.420
the width is dx.

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.600
So we're going to
multiply that times dx.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.300
And then we're going to take
all of the sums from x is equal

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.460
to whatever this point is
to whatever this point is.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.550
So we need to figure out this
point, this value of f, which

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.600
is going to be here, and then
this value of x, which

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.350
is going to be there.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.210
And so these are really just
two of the points where

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.390
these two functions
intersect each other.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.860
So how do we figure
out those points?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.790
Well what we could do is we can
set them equal to each other,

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.640
so we could say at what x
values does x to the third

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.260
minus 4x equal minus 2.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.880
At what x values are
the y values the same?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.120
So we just set them
equal to each other.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.220
If we wanted to write this is a
proper polynomial expression,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.650
we would get x to the third
minus 4x plus 2 is equal to 0.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:22.940
And I actually just tried to
record a video where I was

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.120
doing this on the fly, and I
kept staring at this and I was

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.080
like, boy, this is a hard
polynomial to factor.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.220
I kept trying to guess numbers,
or figuring out-- I even tried

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.670
to do Newton's method-- and I
kept getting weird numbers, and

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.830
I became suspicious of myself.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.410
And then I looked at the
actual test-- actually

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.350
I can show it to you.

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.940
It says right there, a graphing
calculator is required for some

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.390
problems or parts of problems.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.830
And I realized that they
probably want us to use a

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.920
graphing calculator to
figure out the roots

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.290
of this polynomial.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.550
So let's do that.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:00.150
It's been a long time since I
actually took AP Calculus, and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:05.250
now I remember that a graphing
calculator was a big deal.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.425
I just actually downloaded
this TI-85 emulator.

00:04:08.425 --> 00:04:11.940
So let's use this to figure out
the roots of this polynomial.

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.130
Let's turn it on.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.040
If we want to figure out
the roots we use the poly

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.900
function, so second poly.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.540
What's the order of
this polynomial?

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.550
What's the third-degree
polynomial?

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:26.670
f of x to the third.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.110
So order is 3, enter.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:31.980
And what are the coefficients?

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.302
Well the coefficient on x
to the third term is 1.

00:04:36.302 --> 00:04:37.880
Go down.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.960
What's the coefficient
on the x squared term?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.490
Well there is no x
squared term, right?

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.910
So that coefficient is 0.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:47.260
Go down.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.610
What's the coefficient
on the x term?

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.690
It's minus 4.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.420
So minus 4.

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.980
Go down again.

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.720
And then the coefficient
or the constant term.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.390
Well that's just going to be 2.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.403
And now we can just hit solve.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.820
And we get three crazy numbers,
and this shows you that this

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.440
would have been very hard to
solve analytically if you

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:17.490
have a normal brain.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.260
So let's see.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.220
There are three places where y
equals negative 2 intersects y

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.645
is equal to x to the
third minus 4x.

00:05:27.645 --> 00:05:31.090
It intersects at minus 2.21.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.650
Well that's off of this
graph, that's not even here.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.290
That's somewhere
off to the left.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:37.520
This curve probably comes
back down and intersects

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.040
over there at minus 2.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:45.680
But it also intersects at 1.675
which is probably right here.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.980
Right, that looks like 1.675.

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.660
It also intersects at 0.539,
which is right there.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:57.100
So we can use those values that
our graphing calculator gave us

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:59.740
and put it into our
definite integral.

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:06.350
So this point right here our
polynomial solver told us

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.526
is x is equal to 0.539.

00:06:10.526 --> 00:06:16.560
So we'll put here 0.539.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.360
And then this point right
here-- so this is our limits

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.152
of integration for our
definite integral, right?

00:06:21.152 --> 00:06:25.193
We're going to sum up these
little rectangles from x is

00:06:25.193 --> 00:06:35.170
equal to 0.539 to x
is equal to 1.675.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.585
And they told us that they do
not want us to evaluate it,

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:39.140
so we are done with Part b.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.500
We could just write this
and we should hopefully

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.410
get full credit.

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.250
Maybe they'd want you to
simplify this a little bit,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.040
but I'd be surprised if they
were mark off for that.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.240
Anyway, let's do Part c.

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.510
If we have time.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.350
Part c.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:59.490
So they say the region r
is the base of a solid.

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.570
For this solid each
cross-section perpendicular

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.650
to the x-axis is a square.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:05.780
Find the volume of the solid.

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:08.310
OK, so this is interesting.

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.700
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.610
So that curve, I'm going to
draw it kind of with a

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.650
perspective so you can see the
solid they're talking about.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.620
So it's the same region r.

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:19.320
So we had a sin
function on the top.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:20.720
Looks something like that.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.150
And then we had that polynomial
function on the bottom that

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:26.310
looks something like that.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.260
I'm trying to draw
it at an angle.

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.270
So just to show you the x-axis.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.220
This is going to be the x-axis.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.660
Let me draw the y-axis.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.110
The way I drew it now it
looks something like this.

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.710
Trying to do a little bit of
perspective so that we can

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.910
visualize what they're
talking about.

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:00.300
So that's the y-axis.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.310
So that's x y.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.720
And what they're saying, this
is the region r again, just

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:08.330
like in the previous two
parts of the problem.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.330
They say the region r is
the base of a solid.

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.890
So this is the base of a solid.

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:14.630
For this solid each
cross-section perpendicular

00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.490
to the x-axis.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:18.470
So a cross-section
perpendicular to the x-axis.

00:08:18.470 --> 00:08:20.210
Let's see if we can draw that.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.310
So this would be
a cross-section.

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:25.100
So it's like we took a knife
and we cut like this, we cut

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.140
parallel to the y-axis.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:34.410
Say we took this cross-section
of this solid right now.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:36.160
They say that it is a square.

00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.350
So that means that the base has
to be the same height, has

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.290
to be the same disk
size as the height.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.460
So if we took the cross-section
of the solid here it

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:46.100
would be like that.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.720
Here it would be a smaller
square like that.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.810
If we took the cross-section
there, it would be a

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.080
small square as well.

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.645
So what they want us to
do is figure out the

00:09:00.645 --> 00:09:01.170
volume of the solid.

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.500
You can kind of imagine
what it looks like.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.920
It's small squares and the
squares get really big and

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:05.840
then they get small again.

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:07.470
So how do we do that?

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:09.110
Well we do the same thing.

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:13.920
We take the area of each of
these squares-- we know they're

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.920
squares-- times each of the
dx's-- the small differential--

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.200
and we sum them up
over from 0 to 2.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.440
On the first diagram,
I think that was 2.

00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.860
Oh, and I'm about
to be out of time.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.150
So I will continue this
problem in the next video.

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:32.480
See you soon.
