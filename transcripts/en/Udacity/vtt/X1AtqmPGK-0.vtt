00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.950
In this lesson, you'll learn how to
set up your development environment.

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.710
Namely, your editor.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.320
&gt;&gt; Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.920
I thought you told me I
could build a web tack with

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.190
just Notepad and a browser.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.230
&gt;&gt; Well, yeah, I mean in theory you can.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:16.525
But in theory I could use chopsticks
to eat this 16 ounce steak, but

00:00:16.525 --> 00:00:20.305
in practice there are tools that make
the experience much less frustrating.

00:00:20.305 --> 00:00:23.915
If done just the right way, you can
achieve what most developers dream of.

00:00:23.915 --> 00:00:25.275
The state of mind called flow.
