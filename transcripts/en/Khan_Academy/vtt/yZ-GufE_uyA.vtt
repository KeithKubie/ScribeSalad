00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.870
- [Voiceover] So we're told
that the first four terms

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.148
of a geometric sequence are given.

00:00:05.148 --> 00:00:06.463
So they give us the first four terms.

00:00:06.463 --> 00:00:08.636
And they say what is the
fifth term in the sequence.

00:00:08.636 --> 00:00:09.956
And like always pause the video

00:00:09.956 --> 00:00:11.664
and see if you can come
up with the fifth term.

00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:13.960
Well what we have to remind ourselves

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.960
is for a geometric sequence
each successive term

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:23.326
is the previous term
multiplied by some number.

00:00:23.326 --> 00:00:25.073
And that number we call the common ratio.

00:00:25.073 --> 00:00:26.744
So let's think about it.

00:00:26.744 --> 00:00:29.115
To go from negative 1/32,
that's the first term

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:33.261
to 1/8, what do we have to multiply by?

00:00:33.261 --> 00:00:35.211
What do we have to multiply by?

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:35.842
Let's see.

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:36.979
We're going to multiply,

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:38.340
it's going to be multiplied by a negative

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.833
since we went from a
negative to a positive.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:43.226
So we're going to multiply by negative

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.274
and there's going to be a one over

00:00:46.274 --> 00:00:51.274
let's see to go from a 32 to an eight,

00:00:51.414 --> 00:00:53.039
actually it's not going to be a one over.

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.900
It's going to be, this is
four times as large as that.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.647
It's going to be negative four.

00:00:58.647 --> 00:01:03.523
Negative 1/32 times negative
four is positive 1/8.

00:01:03.523 --> 00:01:05.433
Just to make that clear.

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:10.206
Negative 1/32 times negative four

00:01:10.206 --> 00:01:13.417
that's the same thing
as times negative four

00:01:13.417 --> 00:01:14.474
over one.

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.037
It's going to be positive.

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:17.643
Negative times a negative is a positive.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.777
Positive four over 32.

00:01:19.777 --> 00:01:22.499
Which is equal to 1/8.

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.881
Now let's see if that holds up.

00:01:23.881 --> 00:01:27.294
So to go from 1/8 to negative 1/2

00:01:27.294 --> 00:01:31.133
we once again would
multiply by negative four.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.714
Negative four times 1/8 is negative 4/8,

00:01:33.714 --> 00:01:35.319
which is negative 1/2

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.484
and so then we multiply
by negative four again.

00:01:39.484 --> 00:01:42.307
So, let me make it clear.

00:01:42.307 --> 00:01:44.339
We're multiplying by
negative four each time.

00:01:44.339 --> 00:01:45.925
You multiply by negative four again,

00:01:45.925 --> 00:01:47.245
you get to positive two.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:51.207
Because negative four over negative two,

00:01:51.207 --> 00:01:53.015
you can do it that way, is positive two.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:55.738
And so to get the fifth
term in the sequence,

00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:59.029
we would multiply by negative four again.

00:01:59.029 --> 00:02:02.746
And so two times negative
four is negative eight.

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:04.230
Negative four is the common ratio

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:05.834
for this geometric sequence.

00:02:05.834 --> 00:02:06.993
But just to answer the question,

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.090
What is the fifth term?

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.198
It is going to be negative eight.
