OREN JACOB: We're chatting
about storytelling

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.274
in the age of
conversational interfaces.

00:00:09.274 --> 00:00:10.190
My name is Oren Jacob.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.882
I'm the CEO and co-founder of
a company called PullString

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.090
that's very happy to be here.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.090
First, thanks to Google
for inviting me here.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.650
Google's home team, other
folks in the speech recognition

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.980
team, the folks at API, Google
Cloud, and the various friends

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.230
and relatives actually in
Mountain View you work with,

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.700
broadly speaking.

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.150
In particular, let's get
started with the talk.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.380
There we go.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.820
I work at
pullstring.com, and this

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.950
is a picture of the PullString
platform and its authoring

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:34.497
environments.

00:00:34.497 --> 00:00:36.080
We'll do two slides
of that PullString

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.130
and then 58 slides
about everything else.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.890
But I want to motivate
the talk here,

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.310
because this is a professional
platform for computer

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.860
conversation, authoring
environments and integrated ML,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.850
hosted runtime,
analytics, collaboration

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.310
for text and voice form,
including for Google Home.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.440
So the Didi scale out today
was built in PullString

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.320
and live today.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.720
So if you want to
go talk to Didi

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.160
and have it sing back
to you what you said,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.240
you can do that with your
new Google Home, the Google

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.989
[INAUDIBLE] buddy.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020
Thank you, Google,
for the nice gifts.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.960
But today's talk, I want to
start a little farther back.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.440
This is Robert McKee.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.670
And Robert McKee wrote a very
fancy book called "Story."

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.530
There are some
quotes from it here.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.200
And Robert McKee has
made a career out

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.050
of educating people in
the screenplay trade

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.492
about how to build characters
and craft dialogue,

00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:21.200
broadly speaking.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.408
And we're going to motivate
this talk from that place

00:01:23.408 --> 00:01:25.876
and talk about ways
and design motifs.

00:01:25.876 --> 00:01:28.250
Challenges and opportunities
when building conversational

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.470
interfaces is the
point of today's talk.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.930
This first quote from
McKee, "True character

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.962
is revealed in the choices a
human makes under pressure.

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:38.920
The deeper the revelation,
the truer the choice

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.314
to the character's
essential nature."

00:01:41.314 --> 00:01:42.980
One of the principles
of screenwriting--

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.720
and to motivate that for
a second, by the way,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.386
prior to starting
PullString I had spent

00:01:46.386 --> 00:01:48.026
20 years working at Pixar.

00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:49.650
Anyone see a Pixar
movie in their life?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:50.690
Raise your hand.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.470
Oh, come on now.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:52.740
Raise your hand.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.380
OK.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.865
Whose favorite was
"A Bug's Life?"

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.365
No.

00:01:56.365 --> 00:01:57.140
OK.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.920
"Nemo," right?

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.700
Come on.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.640
Well, we'll talk
more in a second.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.040
Well, one of the things that's
always considered at the studio

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.590
that I worked at across
the bay for many years

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.139
is under what pressure do
you put the characters that

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.999
are in your story?

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:11.540
And at what point
do those characters

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.220
make very important decisions?

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.320
And the decisions they
make under pressure

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.192
is what reveals
through the dialogue

00:02:17.192 --> 00:02:19.400
that they use-- that's an
important word for our talk

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.110
here about conversational
interfaces--

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.850
the dialogue they
use, how they express

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.183
what they do under pressure,
and the decisions they make

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.800
is how we understand more
about those characters

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.060
and where they come from.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.110
Here's McKee's book.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.330
So McKee spent--

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:34.610
I think he's passed away
now-- but 20, 30, 40

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.910
years of doing like three-day
long Tony Robbins-style

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:38.600
seminars.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.157
And instead of
spending 2,000 bucks

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:41.990
and go sitting at a
Marriott for three days,

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.300
you can buy the book
for like 19 bucks.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.490
And that's good, because McKee
was a very sharp, I'll say,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.450
speaker.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.310
He enjoyed trashing
most of the work

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.019
produced in Hollywood,
publicly, in front

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.226
of the folks who had done it.

00:02:55.226 --> 00:02:56.450
So it was sort of his shtick.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.340
And you pay two grand
for the privilege.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.630
20 bucks is a better deal.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.150
And it includes really 300,
400, or 500 pages of analysis

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.234
and advocacy in the space.

00:03:06.234 --> 00:03:08.274
I'm going to pick out just
a couple of highlights

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:09.020
from today.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.103
So if you want to do some
good reading afterwards,

00:03:11.103 --> 00:03:12.350
you can check that book out.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:13.766
And you'll find a
lot of the stuff

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:16.262
in here referenced from McKee.

00:03:16.262 --> 00:03:18.470
So I want to talk about
three other particular quotes

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.200
we'll get started with
here due to the level set.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.450
What it means to review a
character under pressure.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.470
Pressure is essential to the
communication of true character

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:28.750
to audiences.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.540
And if nothing is
at risk, and he

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.065
chooses to tell the
truth in a situation

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:36.440
where lying will gain you
nothing, the choice is trivial,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.630
and the moment
expresses nothing.

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.830
This is well characterized
as asking the question, hey,

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.680
Google Home, what's the
weather in Mountain View today?

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.690
We all expect Google
Home to know that,

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.180
and it answers the question
with a high of 86 degrees.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.054
Here's the forecast,
high current temperature

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:56.270
being 79, as I discovered at the
Happy Raspberry Pi Integrated

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.910
Drink Mixer built by API out
there, which is pretty cool.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.770
I like the peach one myself.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.850
However, if the same
character insists

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.140
on telling the truth when a
lie would save their life,

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.050
then we sense that honesty
is at the core of his nature.

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.314
This is the case when you ask
really any personal assistant,

00:04:12.314 --> 00:04:14.480
or really anything in
conversation as a conversation

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.930
interface, a question they
might not know the answer to.

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.470
You've now placed that
agent, that action, that

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:24.119
bot in an awkward position,
either because they didn't

00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:25.910
understand what you
said, so intent was not

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.260
recognized properly.

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:29.390
Perhaps earlier in the
pipeline, speech recognition

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:31.223
may abort and give them
something wrong back

00:04:31.223 --> 00:04:32.660
to the intent recognizer.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.070
Or ultimately, maybe that's
not a thing within scope.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:39.830
As demoed by the happy
drink mixer out there

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:41.007
half an hour ago.

00:04:41.007 --> 00:04:43.340
I think it was Chris was the
guy demoing, is that right?

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.964
So Chris said, hey Google,
what's on the menu today?

00:04:46.964 --> 00:04:49.130
And the assistant didn't
know and said I don't know.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.590
And he then went into
the particular thing

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.380
they had built,
that new one that

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:54.880
will understand the
menu [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.420
ingredients items,
broadly speaking.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.440
But when you answer--

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.740
what you say back is important,
because at that point,

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.730
there is pressure.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.374
You pushed the conversation
interface to a place

00:05:05.374 --> 00:05:08.040
that the thing you designed does
not know how to accommodate it.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.200
So first, can you understand
what was said back?

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.830
And no, you don't
know what to say.

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.185
And then how do you defer?

00:05:13.185 --> 00:05:16.500
Do you either say I
don't know, politely?

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.560
Do you say, bong bong,
checking Wikipedia.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.870
Do you give an answer
and carry it out anyway?

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.940
And the choice you make
there, in particular,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.280
in the areas that are out
of scope for the action

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.990
that you're designing
are probably

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.780
the most important
point in design

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.080
that communicates the tone,
mood, and style of what you're

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.050
trying to build and how you
expect users and your audience

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:39.130
to feel about the thing
that you're building.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.830
You might expect that--

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:43.530
I'm picking some examples
out of thin air here--

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.570
an Uber action,
a Bank of America

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.630
action, a Southwest Airlines
action, and a Lyft action

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.460
would all answer
quite differently

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.870
if you ask them questions
they don't know about,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.925
because the tone, mood,
and style of those brands

00:05:53.925 --> 00:05:55.900
and companies are
very different.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.225
And that's what the
talk's about today.

00:05:58.225 --> 00:06:00.600
And that's McKee at the end
of one of our story seminars.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.160
There always was a standing
ovation at the end,

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.990
because he takes
the last two hours

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.190
to tear apart the various plot
lines in "Casablanca," which

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:09.420
is a fun thing to go read.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.086
If you check Google
Images, you can find

00:06:11.086 --> 00:06:12.485
the graphs he draws for that.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.860
And at the end of
that two hours,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.068
we all cry and weep with joy.

00:06:15.068 --> 00:06:16.952
We've had a story
revealed to us, finally.

00:06:16.952 --> 00:06:18.910
Buy a book for 20 bucks
on the way out, please.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:19.410
Thank you.

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:22.130
See how that plays out.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.040
So moving on past.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.020
Let's define conversation
for a second here.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.386
Sort of scope the talk
more specifically.

00:06:28.386 --> 00:06:29.760
I picked off Google
earlier today

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:34.170
an informal exchange
of ideas, spoken words.

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.240
More casually, two people
talking back and forth

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.890
using natural language.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.446
In computer
conversation, we're going

00:06:39.446 --> 00:06:41.320
to swap out one of those
people and swap them

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.290
in with a very fancy
computer, Google Cloud being

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:45.123
one of the fanciest
ever built on the planet

00:06:45.123 --> 00:06:47.830
Earth today, in fact.

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.940
But even if we do that,
we cannot separate having

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.510
a conversation from thinking
about whom we're having that

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.340
conversation with.

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.230
Those things are
inextricably linked,

00:06:58.230 --> 00:06:59.970
and they have been
since you were born.

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.386
Because everybody you've talked
to-- or, more importantly,

00:07:02.386 --> 00:07:03.500
has talked to you--

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.510
actually had a personality and
a tone, a mood, and a style.

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:09.660
So here's a quote
you should recognize.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.260
It is not, "Luke, I am your
father," the most misquoted

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:14.235
line in movie history.

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:15.030
It's, "No.

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.610
I am your father," for
those nerds in the audience.

00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:19.049
"Empire Strikes Back."

00:07:19.049 --> 00:07:19.590
There you go.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.090
"No.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:20.940
I am your father."

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.260
There we go.

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.600
"To be or not to be."

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.620
Act 3, scene 1 of William
Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.930
Holding the skull.

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:35.994
"I have a dream," by
Dr. King here in DC.

00:07:35.994 --> 00:07:37.560
"I'm sorry, Dave.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:40.060
I can't do that."

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:41.730
Hal.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:46.585
And "Mommy," which is,
of course, my kids.

00:07:46.585 --> 00:07:48.960
So in each one of these cases,
I brought the examples out

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.870
both to be very specific,
very general, to be public,

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.540
and to be private, to be
fictional, and nonfictional,

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.930
to be current and historical
and future tense as well too.

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:00.480
In all circumstances
in these quotes,

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:03.100
I bet you-- who in the audience
recognized the vast majority

00:08:03.100 --> 00:08:03.720
of them immediately?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:04.650
Raise your hands, please.

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:05.010
There we go.

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:07.080
And back at home on livestream,
raise your hands at your desk.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.746
I can't see you.

00:08:07.746 --> 00:08:10.010
OK.

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:12.510
That's why I want to explain
to folks here and get

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.720
the point across very
strongly that, as you design

00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:18.664
the dialogue in
the Google actions

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:21.330
that you build and in the things
you build for Google Assistant,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.970
when you're using
language back and forth,

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:26.520
it is utterly essential
that you contemplate

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.010
both intent and content.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.260
Both understanding, which
is an important part of what

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.179
we do in the tent here,
and also responding back

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:34.590
and how we design that dialogue.

00:08:34.590 --> 00:08:36.740
Because you always associate
what's said with who

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.993
says it behind it.

00:08:38.993 --> 00:08:40.409
In fact, we learn
about each other

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:42.280
through the use of language.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.254
And we do that at two
levels, both on the surface

00:08:45.254 --> 00:08:46.170
and below the surface.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.210
A subtext and a context.

00:08:48.210 --> 00:08:51.700
And I use the iceberg
metaphor here sort of bluntly,

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:55.090
because what's said at
the surface in the context

00:08:55.090 --> 00:08:58.060
of our conversation is an
important part of what gets

00:08:58.060 --> 00:08:59.920
communicated in a conversation.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.739
But all the other
things underneath,

00:09:01.739 --> 00:09:04.030
which take different expressions
in text and voice form

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:06.940
add a whole heck of a lot,
if not even the majority,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.570
of your long-term conception
of the experience.

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:13.690
Subtext can be, in
voice form, prosody.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:16.660
And we're talking super high
really fast or am I going ,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:18.357
mellow dude.

00:09:18.357 --> 00:09:19.690
It means quite different things.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:22.260
Do I uptick at the back
the way I talk or do I not

00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:24.130
and end downbeat?

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.850
In text form, it's
how long does the bot

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.100
get to respond back and forth?

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.660
Do I say typing indicators?

00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:30.130
Does the bot make
spelling errors

00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:32.314
on purpose or actually
randomly back and forth?

00:09:32.314 --> 00:09:33.730
Does the bot
understand leetspeak?

00:09:33.730 --> 00:09:34.990
Does the bot understand emoji?

00:09:34.990 --> 00:09:36.520
Does it understand animated GIF?

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:39.670
Can it respond back with
emoji, animated GIF, or English

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:41.410
or Spanish or Spanglish?

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.660
So North American
normative English

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.020
from an AP English test
given in high school

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.030
is not what we speak
in messaging platforms

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:50.170
in text or voice form.

00:09:50.170 --> 00:09:52.380
It's actually quite different.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:54.040
And understanding
all the other things

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.490
that aren't just the blunt
context around the experience

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.520
strongly communicates
to users and audiences

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:03.591
the tone, mood, and style
of what you're building.

00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:05.590
Let's go out to the
question of personification.

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:07.030
I'm talking a lot
about characters here,

00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:08.550
but we're on the
other hand building

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.790
actions for Google Home.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.644
So yes, I worked on this film.

00:10:11.644 --> 00:10:13.060
But it happens
also to be the case

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.790
that this is the main
theme of every Pixar film

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:18.250
ever made, are things that
aren't human actually talking

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:19.890
back in language back and forth.

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:21.040
Toys talk, fish talk--

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.200
I mean, they don't, but
they do in these movies.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.741
And it's actually
quite common for us

00:10:24.741 --> 00:10:28.360
to personify all
kinds of things.

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.360
That's because we're people,
and when language gets involved,

00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:33.580
we've only been talking to
other people with language

00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.840
since we were all born.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.300
So it makes obvious sense
that if you hear a thing

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.090
or see a thing talk
back and forth to you,

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:42.950
you will project human
traits onto that thing.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.040
Your app has a character
and a backstory

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.429
and a motivation
tone, mood, and style.

00:10:47.429 --> 00:10:48.970
Because everything
you've ever talked

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:50.471
to also does as well too.

00:10:50.471 --> 00:10:52.720
If you don't design for that
and deliver it to people,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.970
people will still
assign it to your thing,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.070
whether you want them
to do that or not.

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:59.540
There actually is both
good news and bad news.

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.720
There are two
stories to tell here.

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:05.042
On the good side,
personification will help you--

00:11:05.042 --> 00:11:06.250
who's a developer themselves?

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:08.230
Raise your hand.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.220
Just a-- really?

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:09.800
Try again.

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.330
Who's a developer here?

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:11.950
OK.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.150
Who's actually
built a thing that

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.200
involves natural language in
their life in some way, shape,

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:15.910
or form?

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.980
Keep your hands up.

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.490
Who's here-- and now we're
going to split left-right hand.

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:19.910
Who's done a thing in text?

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.250
Oh, text stuff?

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:23.360
And hands for voice stuff.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:23.860
OK.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:24.360
Even split.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.070
OK.

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:28.200
Personification helps
you in both cases,

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.840
because the use of
language will engender

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.570
us to assign personal
traits to the thing

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.050
that we're engaging with.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:36.720
And if I do that,
I'm invested in it.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.367
Therefore, I have a hand in
creating that relationship,

00:11:39.367 --> 00:11:40.950
whether it's conscious
or unconscious.

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:43.158
That's the benefits to engage
in [INAUDIBLE] tension,

00:11:43.158 --> 00:11:43.920
broadly speaking.

00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:46.461
On the downside, if you don't
consider that and design for it

00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:48.420
very carefully,
you're effectively

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.980
going to let your
audience of users

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.900
randomly assign the
personality traits they

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.966
would like to your particular
app, action, or bot.

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.840
And in that case, it's
not clear what they're

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840
going to think about it.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.256
So I would strongly advocate
your being in control of that

00:12:01.256 --> 00:12:01.800
as not.

00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.930
To disregard
character in design is

00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:06.460
equivalent to saying letting
the user pick random colors

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.910
and button locations
for your GUI.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:11.797
One of the main differentiating
designs of Google way

00:12:11.797 --> 00:12:13.380
back in the day,
which still do today,

00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:16.290
thankfully, is the remarkably
simple and direct expression

00:12:16.290 --> 00:12:18.750
of Google.com's home page, one
of the gifts to the internet

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:21.960
that is still one of
the joys of web surfing

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.930
in general, to the juxtaposition
of all of the other ones that

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:27.582
didn't do that.

00:12:27.582 --> 00:12:28.290
They're not here.

00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:28.970
You guys still are.

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:31.053
I'm glad to be here with
you, because you guys win

00:12:31.053 --> 00:12:31.770
in that regard.

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.000
But you certainly
wouldn't want someone

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.471
to rescramble the Google Home
page to look all Alta Vista

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:35.970
style.

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:37.761
That's not very helpful
to anybody's cause.

00:12:37.761 --> 00:12:41.310
So by asserting the dialogue
that you have in your things

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:42.840
that you write as
well too, you are

00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:46.890
doing the equivalent to
button layout, GUI layout,

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.900
color palette selection,
responsiveness

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.132
designs as well too,
the kinds of feedback,

00:12:51.132 --> 00:12:52.590
whether you want
to go skeuomorphic

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:55.700
or not with the interfaces
we build in GUIs.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.920
But different in
voice interfaces.

00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.820
And while it still
might work, yes, you

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:03.956
could type text into an old Alta
Vista search if you cared to.

00:13:03.956 --> 00:13:05.330
As a functional
spec requirement,

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:05.820
I didn't really care.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.278
It turns out none of the rest
of the world did either, too.

00:13:08.278 --> 00:13:11.520
So scooting on to foundations
of design and computer

00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.400
conversation.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:18.290
A way to think about this,
and also one of the reasons

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.125
I started the talk
mentioning Robert McKee,

00:13:20.125 --> 00:13:21.875
was you can kind of
think about this space

00:13:21.875 --> 00:13:23.780
as interactive screenwriting.

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.030
But the trick is, that
for us in this tent,

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:28.700
we're responsible for
lines 1, 3, 5, and 7

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:31.010
but not 2, 4, 6, and 8.

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:33.785
2, 4, 6, and 8 are everything
said back to us by the user.

00:13:33.785 --> 00:13:36.170
And interestingly enough,
we have actually no control

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:37.400
at all over those.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.980
That's what's said back to us.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:41.750
And that's an
important distinction,

00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.300
because this isn't actually
true in GUI designs.

00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:47.720
In GUI designs, you're
asserting what text entry points

00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:50.180
you're putting up, what dialog
boxes, what buttons, what

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:51.890
sliders and widgets you have.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.770
In this case, language
is the response back.

00:13:54.770 --> 00:13:58.970
And language is a very
unconstrained space.

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:01.610
Part of this craft comes from
traditional screenwriting,

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:04.385
stage writing, theater, prose,
character, story, and dialogue.

00:14:04.385 --> 00:14:08.370
The linear narrative arts, and
there's a lot of literature.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:10.870
I give you only one reference
here to look at in that space.

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:13.400
The other half of this comes
from the art of gaming and web

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.000
mobile design and
creating engagement

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.480
and retention-- the interactive
arts in those designs.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.930
And this field of crafting
interactive conversation

00:14:20.930 --> 00:14:23.990
is one of the unique
blends of these two things.

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.900
There are analogies we
can make to some degree.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.675
In the space of
video game design,

00:14:28.675 --> 00:14:30.800
whether that's mobile, web,
or a console or desktop

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.700
or otherwise, there is a similar
combination to some degree.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.130
But it's just now in
the past 10 or 15 years

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:39.284
that the fields of
interaction design

00:14:39.284 --> 00:14:40.700
and the fields of
linear narrative

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.869
have begun to cross each other.

00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:44.660
And I think in the
space here, particularly

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:46.234
with text and
voice space design,

00:14:46.234 --> 00:14:47.900
is one of the most
important expressions

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:51.260
of that new combination
and a fun place to work.

00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:56.370
So here are three of the sort
of pretty elemental concepts

00:14:56.370 --> 00:14:59.140
to consider as we
go into design here.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.750
One is the concept of fidelity.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:03.600
And so the related
word here is adjacency.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:06.330
Computer conversation
always happens

00:15:06.330 --> 00:15:09.270
adjacent to real-life
full-fidelity human-to-human

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:09.847
conversation.

00:15:09.847 --> 00:15:11.430
If you're talking
to your Google Home,

00:15:11.430 --> 00:15:13.050
and it's sitting on
a kitchen counter,

00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:14.850
you're probably at breakfast
with your kids and your wife

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:16.920
and husband having a lovely
morning conversation.

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.420
And then you're
heckling Google Home

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.336
to do a thing for you,
whether it's play music

00:15:20.336 --> 00:15:22.892
or control your lights, or
order something as well too.

00:15:22.892 --> 00:15:25.350
But it's happening right in
and amongst your family already

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:26.710
talking.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.252
If you're texting back
and forth with a bot,

00:15:29.252 --> 00:15:31.710
that's probably happening on
a messaging platform somewhere

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:33.180
or on your phone
where there already

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:35.554
are a billion other folks
texting back and forth with you

00:15:35.554 --> 00:15:37.180
who are all actually humans.

00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:38.760
So the adjacency
issue is actually

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.380
very distinct from
the other things

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.088
that I mentioned
earlier on in this talk.

00:15:42.088 --> 00:15:44.510
That is not true with
the art of video gaming.

00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.260
And let me go nerd
out with my Xbox

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.480
or play on my Android
phone sitting on BART.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.070
It's not the case
that I was just

00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:53.100
playing chess or Rochambeau
with the guy next to me

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.480
on BART, probably.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.970
So the game adjacency
issue is quite separated.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:58.914
I play with my family
Monopoly over here,

00:15:58.914 --> 00:16:00.330
and I brought out
my Android phone

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:02.410
and want to play "Clash
of Clans" over there.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.220
But in this case, it probably
is true that I'm texting back

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.780
and forth with a billion other
folks who have mobile phones--

00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:10.050
sorry, n billion other folks
who have phones out there

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:10.769
in the world--

00:16:10.769 --> 00:16:12.810
and my boss engaging me
then, or Google Assistant

00:16:12.810 --> 00:16:14.220
is, in text form.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:17.052
And my Google Home is
sitting in my house.

00:16:17.052 --> 00:16:18.510
Also, I'm a nerd,
in my office too.

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:20.070
But let's go to
my house for now.

00:16:20.070 --> 00:16:22.710
And at my house, my family is
there speaking back and forth.

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.890
That means the bar one
has to reach of adjacency

00:16:25.890 --> 00:16:28.452
is actually all of us
talking to each other.

00:16:28.452 --> 00:16:29.910
And that's essential
to this field.

00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:31.049
That's a super high bar.

00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:33.090
There's been a lot of
heckling about [? bosses ?]

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:34.220
past year back and forth.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.930
That's because we're
reaching for human fidelity

00:16:36.930 --> 00:16:39.120
conversation, not because--

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.300
many people say, like
the public's expectations

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.240
were so high.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.580
I think it's just a blunt truth.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.100
It's against all of us
talking to each other.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:49.170
So we have to
accommodate that need.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.855
And that also speaks,
I think, broadly to

00:16:51.855 --> 00:16:53.980
should the things you write
be able to make a joke?

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:55.604
Should they be able
to answer questions

00:16:55.604 --> 00:16:57.960
about the topics you're
building for-- travel,

00:16:57.960 --> 00:16:59.460
finance, ecommerce,
whatever it is--

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.261
or answer the questions
about everything?

00:17:02.261 --> 00:17:04.260
I'm going to pick that
last one up for a second.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:09.109
There's been a theme I've seen
when it comes to text and voice

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:11.040
space work produced
in the space,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.290
that on texting or
talking back and forth

00:17:13.290 --> 00:17:16.020
to this particular action,
it should be able to respond

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:18.900
to any question that I asked
and do so in a way that's

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:20.220
quite informative.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:22.200
But that's not true of
any of us in this tent.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.794
None of us knows everything.

00:17:23.794 --> 00:17:25.710
In fact, while Google
doesn't know everything,

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:27.339
at least it organizes it all
for us, which is super helpful.

00:17:27.339 --> 00:17:28.547
But it doesn't actually know.

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:30.280
Everything in the
world is not knowable.

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.990
So that expectation is unusually
pressed upon actions and bots,

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.050
because we don't press it
upon ourselves actually ever.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.836
And if you spoke to someone
who actually knew everything,

00:17:39.836 --> 00:17:42.210
I think you've crossed into
some other plane of existence

00:17:42.210 --> 00:17:43.418
that I can't describe for us.

00:17:43.418 --> 00:17:45.120
That's not true of our reality.

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.560
So that also speak--

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.920
I use that motivating
case to talk

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.780
about specificity of design.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:54.000
And if you're talking about
an ecommerce experience

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.510
or travel or
hospitality or fitness,

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.340
and you're building
that for Google Home,

00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:01.864
making that be the most
amazing fitness thing

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:03.780
you can talk to you back
and forth seems quite

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.910
appropriate to do, but
not answer questions

00:18:05.910 --> 00:18:07.590
about geography
or about history,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.800
but find a way to actually
move the conversation back

00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.300
in the tone, mood, and style
that a fitness instructor would

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.950
do to get you back to your
fitness-based actions.

00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:18.930
Let's talk about
agency for a second.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.290
So today, I think Kurzweil
may have a different opinion

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.800
about this, but synthetic
autonomous emergent personality

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:28.851
today is nowhere close
to human fidelity yet.

00:18:28.851 --> 00:18:30.350
It may get there,
in which case I'll

00:18:30.350 --> 00:18:32.040
be back here talking to you in
a few years about that agenda.

00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:33.640
But that's not true today.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.920
But is that a problem for us?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:40.440
And I don't think it is today,
because world of fiction--

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.160
here's some "Game of
Thrones" cost players

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.780
that I found up there.

00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.060
I like the "Mario" ones
in a previous slide,

00:18:47.060 --> 00:18:50.290
as a way to motivate fictional
characters in our daily lives--

00:18:50.290 --> 00:18:53.960
suggest that specifically
crafted characters and designed

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.344
behaviors can be as
or more effective,

00:18:57.344 --> 00:18:59.510
because they've been created
to match the situations

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.180
and outcomes we need them for.

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.840
Going back to my
fitness example,

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:06.137
just picking that out of thin
air here for Google Home,

00:19:06.137 --> 00:19:07.970
any fitness experience
that I'm talking back

00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.094
to on Google Home will be
designed by maybe someone

00:19:10.094 --> 00:19:13.781
in this tent, as opposed to the
actual person at the gym, who

00:19:13.781 --> 00:19:16.280
kind of got a parking ticket,
got a decaf coffee by accident

00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:17.870
at Starbucks instead of
their caffeine coffee

00:19:17.870 --> 00:19:19.880
and was kind of cheesed
off in your spin class,

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.740
and brought that attitude
into the class as well too.

00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:23.390
And that may not be the
most helpful thing for you

00:19:23.390 --> 00:19:25.598
at the time, trying to work
out with your Google Home

00:19:25.598 --> 00:19:27.920
as you get back to your kitchen.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:30.020
I think that if you look
at this slide also too,

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.050
a relevant point to make here
is that, going back to earlier

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.314
in the talk when I
brought up "Hamlet,"

00:19:36.314 --> 00:19:37.980
I threw down a quote
from a thing that's

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:40.980
on the order of 500 years
old, so half a millennium old.

00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.790
And people all got that.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.600
So the lasting legacy of
character and dialogue

00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.910
can span, not generations,
millennia of time.

00:19:47.910 --> 00:19:50.490
Already does today in
the form of written word

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:52.860
and spoken word and live
theater and stage play.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.640
So the ideas that are presented
when you design a character

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.806
and personality can strongly
reach across history

00:19:58.806 --> 00:20:00.180
and give you a
sense of the depth

00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.774
and strength of that
advocacy in our design work.

00:20:02.774 --> 00:20:04.940
And I had to throw up
[INAUDIBLE] doing cosplay here

00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.850
as a motivating case.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:07.962
That's a lot of Stormtroopers.

00:20:07.962 --> 00:20:09.920
And it turns out they
actually formed a brigade

00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:10.860
and walked around themselves.

00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:12.540
They spend about as
much time doing this

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.914
as people in the
military reserve

00:20:13.914 --> 00:20:16.140
do here in this
country, it turns out.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:19.740
And while I support "Star
Wars" and maybe our US military

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:22.380
as well, and then for
Lucasfilm on this one,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.150
because that's pretty
cool they do that.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:24.650
All right.

00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:26.990
So on to creativity.

00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.040
Am I a computer scientist
or should I become one?

00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:31.644
Or am I a writer and
should I become one?

00:20:31.644 --> 00:20:33.435
Both of these are highly
creative pursuits,

00:20:33.435 --> 00:20:35.930
but with different emphases.

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.120
So it depends on what
you're trying to do.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.620
There are many
things that are built

00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:43.200
in the space of the
computer conversation that

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.030
are transactional-based.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:48.570
In ecommerce, banking and
fund transfers as well too,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:50.610
and those things
are very efficient

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.240
and compact expressions.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.740
There are also
things that are built

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.250
that have much more sort
of poetic intentions.

00:20:56.250 --> 00:21:01.070
Interactive fiction, broadly
speaking, mysteries, romance.

00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:03.510
The genres of literature also
can be expressed this way

00:21:03.510 --> 00:21:04.500
as well too.

00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.680
And in between kind of
exists everything else.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:10.999
Deciding who is
writing your dialogue

00:21:10.999 --> 00:21:13.290
and who's thinking about your
dialogue design, I think,

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:15.960
should be motivated by
those cases back and forth.

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.670
But the spectrum
exists in this field,

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:19.628
and I want to talk about
celebrating both sides

00:21:19.628 --> 00:21:21.775
of this the rest of this talk.

00:21:21.775 --> 00:21:23.900
"Creativity is just connecting
things," from Steve.

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:25.941
I had to throw that quote
down here for us today.

00:21:25.941 --> 00:21:29.220
So three topics in particular,
getting specifically

00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:31.350
to designing of
actions directly,

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.675
and voice space skills in
content, intent, and context.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.600
Keyboard, mice, and
touchscreens are all examples

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.490
of high precision,
high accuracy,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:43.400
and unambiguous inputs.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:44.850
Was the button pressed or not?

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:46.410
But they have a
very small aperture.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:48.930
Got a button click,
got a key press.

00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.440
Language is hugely imprecise,
terribly inaccurate,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.830
utterly ambiguous, and has
a near infinite aperture.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:57.870
But it can be
shockingly efficient.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.070
And it's in this juxtaposition
here that the most important

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.380
difference is about how
we design has sort of come

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:05.777
to surface now.

00:22:05.777 --> 00:22:07.485
I brought up the words
love and hate here

00:22:07.485 --> 00:22:13.020
for a second, because in
four characters, both sides,

00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:14.970
nations go to war,
peace treaties

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:18.630
are signed, humanity
advances itself

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.940
at a level of just
four simple characters,

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:24.690
also with a bracket and
a slash as well, too.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.290
It's impossible to express
that in a GUI interface.

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:30.360
With a voice and
language interface,

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:33.780
you can, and you can get to
all things like awkward here.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.640
I've got a picture of
a monkey's face here.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.270
The concept of awkwardness is
a very interesting proposition,

00:22:39.270 --> 00:22:41.394
because it presupposes
you understand

00:22:41.394 --> 00:22:43.560
what the monkey and the
face should have been doing.

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.230
Why does it look funny
or sarcastic to you

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:48.210
as it relates to other
faces that you've seen

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:50.040
with goofy smiles in selfies?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:52.920
It's all a set of
information encapsulated

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:56.490
in that word next to that image.

00:22:56.490 --> 00:22:59.190
We invented language,
in fact, to communicate

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:01.980
the human condition in all
of its complexity, ambiguity,

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.339
and subtlety.

00:23:03.339 --> 00:23:05.130
And so the design
principles themselves now

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:06.840
and practices that
help us handle

00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.320
this in a medium whose
boundaries are [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:13.080
include content and intent.

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.842
Intent recognition,
as we all know,

00:23:14.842 --> 00:23:17.050
is a thing that many people
focused on in this field,

00:23:17.050 --> 00:23:19.020
including Google with API
[INAUDIBLE] offerings,

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.061
and other places in the
Google network of things.

00:23:21.061 --> 00:23:22.470
And that's good.

00:23:22.470 --> 00:23:25.320
That's understanding what's
said inbound to us by user.

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.540
And I do celebrate that,
but it's half the problem.

00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:31.110
The other half of the problem is
content, which is as important

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.110
and requires equal attention
from both our tools

00:23:34.110 --> 00:23:35.912
and our processes on both sides.

00:23:35.912 --> 00:23:37.620
If you're looking at
the amount of effort

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.110
put into building an
action for Google Home,

00:23:40.110 --> 00:23:42.270
and you have a 10-week
project to work on,

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:45.805
10 person weeks to assign to it,
if you're spending eight person

00:23:45.805 --> 00:23:47.930
weeks designing your intents
and three days writing

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.304
dialog and then
debugging, you've

00:23:49.304 --> 00:23:51.690
not spent your
resources in a way that

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:54.030
represents what the
design requirements really

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:54.900
are of the project.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.400
Those two things
are actually almost

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.972
bang on even money,
broadly speaking,

00:23:58.972 --> 00:24:00.930
because half of a
conversation is understanding

00:24:00.930 --> 00:24:02.150
what you say to me.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.774
And the other half
is me answering back

00:24:03.774 --> 00:24:05.300
to you in response back.

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.830
You have to handle both
of those things evenly.

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:10.690
I think as an industry,
we way over-index

00:24:10.690 --> 00:24:12.210
on intent recognition.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:13.620
I understand why.

00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.750
That's a problem computer
scientists are very well

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:17.190
schooled to go solve.

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:18.924
That makes perfectly
reasonable sense.

00:24:18.924 --> 00:24:20.590
It's also a thing we
didn't have before.

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.506
So we had to go build.

00:24:21.506 --> 00:24:22.912
Machine learn recognize intent.

00:24:22.912 --> 00:24:23.620
And that's great.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:25.286
We have those and
they're advancing now,

00:24:25.286 --> 00:24:26.790
going forward day by day.

00:24:26.790 --> 00:24:28.320
As a field that
produces work now

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.620
in the space for audiences
and users to use and engage,

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.390
contemplating both
what's understood

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:35.220
and what's said back
with even measure

00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:40.080
is an advocacy I want to
bring to you guys today.

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.870
Iteration and creative control.

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:47.220
Iteration time enables creative
expressivity and reach.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.810
How efficiently
can I do a thing?

00:24:48.810 --> 00:24:51.610
The faster I do it, the
better I can make it.

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.610
The background of the
slide I chose specifically

00:24:53.610 --> 00:24:55.500
because this is
a gesture drawing

00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:01.620
agenda done by a woman, Elaine
[? Horry, ?] I found online--

00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:04.240
license to be used here
for you guys to see--

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.045
and was done in a session
often sitting down with a model

00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:08.920
and drawing various
gestures in these styles.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.710
So who here has a
guess for how long

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:12.850
it took her to do
that many drawings?

00:25:12.850 --> 00:25:14.706
Throw a number out.

00:25:14.706 --> 00:25:15.996
AUDIENCE: 20 minutes.

00:25:15.996 --> 00:25:17.370
OREN JACOB: 20
minutes over here.

00:25:17.370 --> 00:25:18.595
I hear a week over there.

00:25:18.595 --> 00:25:20.977
Just a couple days.

00:25:20.977 --> 00:25:22.560
These are probably
done, I'm guessing,

00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.310
at about 30 seconds
to one minute

00:25:26.310 --> 00:25:28.590
per, broadly speaking,
typically a lunch session is

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:30.480
done at the studio,
where you're drawing

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.969
as fast and rapidly as you can.

00:25:31.969 --> 00:25:33.510
And one of the
reasons why, if you're

00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:35.593
going to spend four years
making an animated film,

00:25:35.593 --> 00:25:37.770
you want to nerd out at
lunch drawing rapidly,

00:25:37.770 --> 00:25:40.841
is you can iterate through
dozens and dozens of poses

00:25:40.841 --> 00:25:42.840
for a character in the
course of a two-hour span

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.900
before you spend the time to
dental floss it in the film,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:47.850
finally, as from
my previous life.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:49.670
In this slide here,
how long does it

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:50.817
take me to debug my bot?

00:25:50.817 --> 00:25:52.650
Why did the thing answer
back the way it did

00:25:52.650 --> 00:25:53.655
and what is it saying next?

00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:56.185
Oh, I have to go build a thing
and recompile it and push it

00:25:56.185 --> 00:25:57.960
out to the cloud and
carry on as well too.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.450
Or can I see it live in where
I'm working right now today?

00:26:00.450 --> 00:26:01.950
The time it takes
you as a developer

00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:05.070
out there to run a full loop
to understand what broke

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:06.900
and how to fix
it, as we all know

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.510
from being software developers,
is an essential contributor

00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:12.100
to our efficiency in that area.

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.520
So I want to push that forward
here in this basic computer

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.000
conversation that it's
not just how fast I'm

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.390
going to design my intent.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:20.980
It's not just how fast
I can write my dialogue.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.359
It's when I have the thing
stood up and running,

00:26:23.359 --> 00:26:24.900
and I'm chatting
back and forth a bit

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.960
or talking back and forth to
it, how long in clock time

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.172
is the actual loop
from it saying

00:26:30.172 --> 00:26:32.130
a thing I didn't want it
to say to me fixing it

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:34.050
and saying it the
right way next time?

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:35.640
Measure that on
the clock, and when

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.300
you're down from eight hours
to one hour to 15 minutes

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.880
to a minute to actual
real-time, you've

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:43.710
watched yourself from
a year-long project

00:26:43.710 --> 00:26:45.870
to a due deadline
project as well.

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:48.480
More importantly, though,
than the budget implications

00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.340
are if you're at a
place where in real time

00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.380
you're editing and
working and fixing things,

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.820
you're then going to
start experimenting.

00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.440
You're then going to start
playing with the thing.

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.981
And you're going to find what
you can achieve in conversation

00:26:57.981 --> 00:27:01.370
will then expand significantly
beyond a graph [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:04.170
connected, a very simple diagram
of say this, then go this, then

00:27:04.170 --> 00:27:05.240
go here.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.320
Well, I'll start there,
but because language

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.850
is so expressive, our
users do this to us anyway.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.100
So it's an important way to
think about the tool steps

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:13.683
that you use and the
process you bring

00:27:13.683 --> 00:27:15.645
to bear to measure
the efficiency of it

00:27:15.645 --> 00:27:18.820
and how fast you can
fix and adapt things.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:21.930
Predictability is a
critical design agenda here

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:23.130
as well, too.

00:27:23.130 --> 00:27:25.680
Often we're asked to throw
more data at machine learn

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.330
and intent recognizers,
because they'll get better.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.544
Well, for the
folks in this room,

00:27:30.544 --> 00:27:32.460
I bet you probably
understand what that means.

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:34.350
But a lot of the rest
of the world might not.

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:37.130
And in particular,
what data and how much?

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.490
And if I did that,
how would it change?

00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:42.070
Linearity isn't the
requirement here.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.330
Predictability is.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:47.020
And I think that as many more
folks out there become educated

00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:49.720
about the techniques of machine
learn intent recognition,

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.976
broadly speaking, folks
beyond just this tent

00:27:51.976 --> 00:27:54.100
will get better and be able
to do this in the wild.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:55.600
But today this is
a real struggle

00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.539
for a lot of folks
and developers

00:27:57.539 --> 00:27:59.080
who aren't at Google,
but are outside

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.079
doing their own things
in computer conversation,

00:28:01.079 --> 00:28:04.330
in text or voice form.

00:28:04.330 --> 00:28:06.447
For them, to improve their
machine learn intent,

00:28:06.447 --> 00:28:09.113
broadly speaking, is a challenge
I share with you-- we all share

00:28:09.113 --> 00:28:11.050
as an industry-- to
help us understand

00:28:11.050 --> 00:28:12.910
how to better work with things.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:14.560
I use the idea of
a black box here.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.009
You never want a black
box in a creative agenda.

00:28:19.009 --> 00:28:20.800
I have a picture of a
bike here on purpose.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:22.790
So who here knows
how to ride a bike?

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:23.950
All hands should go up.

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:24.449
Yeah.

00:28:24.449 --> 00:28:24.957
OK.

00:28:24.957 --> 00:28:27.040
If I'm on a bike, and I
stand off and take my hand

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.184
on the seat, and I shove
the bike down the street,

00:28:29.184 --> 00:28:30.100
what does the bike do?

00:28:32.770 --> 00:28:33.886
Anybody?

00:28:33.886 --> 00:28:35.700
Does it fall over?

00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.420
Immediately?

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:38.240
No.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.820
It will soar for
some period of time

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:43.950
and doing kind of
this-- whoa whoa whoa.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.600
And then it will cliff out.

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.610
Who here can explain
to me the physics

00:28:47.610 --> 00:28:50.540
behind how that actually works
in a closed-form solution?

00:28:50.540 --> 00:28:52.580
Anybody?

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:53.080
No.

00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:56.650
It's actually not describable
by modern mechanics today

00:28:56.650 --> 00:28:58.900
in a closed-form
solution, interestingly.

00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.550
But yet, you all
raised your hands

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.720
because you can ride a bike.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:09.060
A bike is a remarkably nonlinear
mechanical dynamic mechanism.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:11.290
We in our minds
have all understood

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:13.895
how to lean, reverse back,
adjust the handlebar,

00:29:13.895 --> 00:29:16.270
and correct against the steer
to get the lean over to get

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.540
the bike to turn, even though
no physics professor at Cal

00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.670
or Standford could whiteboard
out how that actually

00:29:21.670 --> 00:29:23.674
works in a closed-form
solution today.

00:29:23.674 --> 00:29:25.340
So a good example
from all of our lives,

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:28.660
including my young kids' lives,
about the human mind's ability

00:29:28.660 --> 00:29:31.600
to map a predictable
very complex system

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.820
and work with it
very, very creatively,

00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.204
even though it's not linear.

00:29:37.204 --> 00:29:39.370
And now I'm going to tie
this together with context.

00:29:39.370 --> 00:29:41.460
This word is like super
over-used in this space.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.670
So I'm going to try to talk
about this a little bit

00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:44.320
quite directly here.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.050
First, at a high level, context
is the mental scaffolding

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.320
that we and our technology need
to help us manage complexity.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.010
Hence the Pantheon in the back
getting rebuilt for you there.

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.250
Conversation, broadly speaking,
is a piecewise linear agenda.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.750
If I'm going to negotiate
with you about a pizza order

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:00.458
back and forth for a
few minutes and then

00:30:00.458 --> 00:30:02.110
about my commute
home on BART and then

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:03.640
about what I'm doing this
weekend, going to Tahoe or not,

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.250
back and forth, each one of our
pizza discussions and our BART

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:08.041
discussions was locally
two, three, or four

00:30:08.041 --> 00:30:10.855
turns about pizza and
then BART and then Tahoe.

00:30:10.855 --> 00:30:13.727
And notice that was pizza, BART,
and Tahoe is not connected.

00:30:13.727 --> 00:30:16.060
Those small piecewise linear
bits that connect together,

00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.893
we can take large
advantage of, because when

00:30:17.893 --> 00:30:20.280
I'm talking about pizza, and
nerding out about mozzarella

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.870
versus pepperoni, and I'm having
that discussion about pizza

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:26.269
ordering agendas, not about
what the guy next to me

00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:28.060
was eating on the BART
train, which I could

00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:29.290
be saying in the next agenda.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.650
I don't think we take
advantage of this enough.

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.480
And I say this because
a lot of systems

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.820
today built offer giant
long flat lists of intents

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.710
to recognize, broadly
speaking, and don't

00:30:38.710 --> 00:30:41.890
use where you are in the
context of the conversation

00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:44.350
to motivate intent recognition
and to motivate dialogue

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:45.560
going back and forth.

00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:47.059
That's true in how
you build things.

00:30:47.059 --> 00:30:48.160
It's true in our toolsets.

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.110
As a field, in
general, you can only

00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:54.220
pull this off if you combine
content and intent together,

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:56.560
not keep them
separated far apart.

00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.240
But brought together,
it lets the folks

00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.020
who build actions and bots
and other things as well

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.910
work with both of those
things back and forth

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:06.820
in and amongst each other as you
blend and create in the space

00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.570
together.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.285
It's one of the most important
points of this talk here.

00:31:11.285 --> 00:31:13.660
So I tie this down now as we
get to a few minutes for Q&amp;A

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.326
at the end here.

00:31:14.326 --> 00:31:17.990
I'll talk about, one, having
gone through all that,

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:19.832
I'll leave you with the
following conundrum.

00:31:19.832 --> 00:31:21.790
And my favorite rock 'em,
sock 'em slide, which

00:31:21.790 --> 00:31:23.410
I had to throw in there too.

00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:25.904
The more personality that
you offer in a thing,

00:31:25.904 --> 00:31:27.820
the more you'll engage
and delight your users,

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.370
broadly speaking, and
the more memorable

00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:31.910
you will be long term.

00:31:31.910 --> 00:31:35.560
At the same time, more
personality that you offer,

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.250
the more you polarize and
segment your audience.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:41.470
Without mentioning names,
if you participated

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:43.190
in the last US
presidential election,

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:45.190
there were two candidates
who, broadly speaking,

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:47.200
move the country
into two places.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.000
I don't think anybody
in this country

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.940
wanted to vote for both
of them simultaneously.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.350
That would make little sense.

00:31:53.350 --> 00:31:54.920
That's why there
were two candidates.

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:56.586
I won't go any farther
than that, but as

00:31:56.586 --> 00:31:59.560
an example of if you went
that far with personality,

00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:02.590
you actually chopped your
audience bang-on in half.

00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.480
Now, that's not a thing a
company like Google can do.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.700
You're trying to reach
everybody in the world.

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:10.033
And, of course, me and some
awesome rad action developer

00:32:10.033 --> 00:32:11.680
wants the biggest
audience I can get.

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:14.410
So therefore, should I withdraw
and not do any personality

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.120
to maintain a giant audience?

00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.550
Well, if I built a thing
that appealed to absolutely

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:20.092
everybody, it would
be the definition

00:32:20.092 --> 00:32:22.758
of the most average thing in the
world, which actually is boring

00:32:22.758 --> 00:32:23.992
to everybody as well, too.

00:32:23.992 --> 00:32:25.450
Google is not taking
that position.

00:32:25.450 --> 00:32:27.090
Your home page is
not a boring design.

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:28.940
It's actually quite
a bang-on crisp one

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.398
and it has been now, again,
for going on nearly two decades

00:32:31.398 --> 00:32:33.560
now, to your credit.

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.330
So what do we do?

00:32:34.330 --> 00:32:37.782
Do we go all-in Darth Vader and
go full personality or all-in

00:32:37.782 --> 00:32:39.490
plain vanilla and do
nothing as well too?

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.780
And that is the
art of the space.

00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:43.400
That's a judgment call.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.880
But I won't leave you with
just a hanging I don't know.

00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.170
There's no right answer here.

00:32:47.170 --> 00:32:51.290
But as a thought, creating
one average personality,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:54.100
I don't think, is likely a
path to the right answer.

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.050
My best suggestion is to
consider a countable plurality

00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:00.940
of personalities to get a
good match for the over 95%

00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:03.310
cases of potential audiences.

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:06.130
In the case above, if you just
built the average personality,

00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:08.650
for any individual user
when something more

00:33:08.650 --> 00:33:10.720
funny or appealing shows up--

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.519
perhaps Samuel Jackson is
doing the voice of your banking

00:33:13.519 --> 00:33:14.560
app for your Capital One.

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.912
I could imagine that happening.

00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.370
People who like
Samuel Jackson will

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:20.950
go and be attracted to that
and be pulled off the average.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:22.325
The average sitting
in the middle

00:33:22.325 --> 00:33:24.850
is susceptible to any one of
the particulars being better,

00:33:24.850 --> 00:33:27.070
and that plurality
will be them over time.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:29.650
But you can't write a
personality for all of them.

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.380
That would be uncountable
number of personalities.

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:35.440
So I think the answer probably
plays out here to a countable

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:38.110
plurality to meet the largest
audience that could get

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:41.402
to a 95%-plus case of coverage
of appeal, broadly speaking,

00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:42.610
to a general global audience.

00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:47.990
Parting shot for two minutes,
your questions coming up here,

00:33:47.990 --> 00:33:49.580
is that you can check
out pullstring.com

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.020
if you want to work
with a system that

00:33:51.020 --> 00:33:51.760
offers those things together.

00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:54.272
It's what we're trying to build
here at PullString and doing

00:33:54.272 --> 00:33:54.980
that with Google.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.200
And thanks for your
help in that regard too.

00:33:57.200 --> 00:33:59.690
And if you want to build some
awesome actions for Google

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.910
Home, you can start that
like this afternoon.

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.320
People [INAUDIBLE] to do that.

00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.312
Thank you all.

00:34:04.312 --> 00:34:06.240
[APPLAUSE]
