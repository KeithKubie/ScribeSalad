&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.400
&gt;&gt; Michelle.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.500
[ Applause ]

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.490
&gt;&gt; Michelle Brown: So, my first
job was teaching seventh grade

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.260
reading at a high poverty
school in rural Mississippi.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.770
I walked into this
classroom on day one

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
with no teaching
materials, not even books

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.070
and I spent the next two years
scrambling to build a curriculum

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.330
for students that in a single
classroom had reading aptitudes

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.670
spanning seven different
grade levels.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.650
I worked so hard because
I knew what was at stake.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.270
How well a kid reads
in eighth grade is one

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.920
of the single best predictors
we have of life outcomes.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.270
It's a predictor of high
school and college graduation

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.110
and even lifetime earnings.

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.760
So, my name is Michelle
Brown and I started CommonLit

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:22.650
because I believe that we can
change the game for students

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.870
in low-income schools by giving
teachers the tools they need

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.230
to teach reading and
writing at a high level.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.480
CommonLit is a free
online reading program

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.920
that helps students
develop advanced reading

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.400
and writing skills.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.700
Today we're serving over 2.7
million teachers and students

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.330
in over 38 US schools and we're

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.860
in a high growth period gaining
20,000 new registered users

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.410
per day.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.690
We're specifically focused
on reaching students

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.880
in low-income schools that are
often the last to get access

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.790
to cutting-edge technology
and quality reading materials.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.240
So, why are so many
people signing up?

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.970
Well at CommonLit.org
teachers can go online

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.370
and create a free account and
browse our leveled library

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.390
of hundreds high interest
and engaging authentic texts

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.780
and lessons all prepared
by master teachers.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.530
These are news articles, poems,

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.550
short stories, historical
documents.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.880
Students interact
with digital texts,

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.610
they learn new vocabulary words,
they have high-level discussions

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.180
with their classmates, and
they complete a standards align

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.910
comprehension quiz.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.550
Our data reports help
teachers determine

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.050
which students need extra
and personalized support.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.340
So, the reason our content
is so high-quality is

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.450
that we have leveraged the
work of our content partners,

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.600
Smithsonian institutions and
even archives from the Library

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.430
of Congress, like the
Veterans History Project

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.260
so that students can actually
read great authentic literature.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.950
And we get these texts
because we are a nonprofit.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.380
This is why we are committed
to keeping CommonLit 100% free

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.590
for teachers and
students forever.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.440
So, we're spreading
rapidly right now,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.820
primarily through teacher
to teacher word-of-mouth

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.310
and a bootstrap marketing
budget.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.660
And today in Mississippi,
the state of Mississippi

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:53.130
where I used to teach over
700 schools rely on CommonLit.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.070
Now I want to tell you
about one of those stops.

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.750
In Mrs. Green's class, seventh
grade class, in Desoto County,

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.280
Mississippi students
are working in pairs

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.570
to read complex informational
texts.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.060
And Mrs. Green has noticed

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.520
that CommonLit has increased
student achievement in reading

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.380
and also student's
motivation to read.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.910
We also know from our first
full year of implementation

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.450
and from our third-party
evaluator is

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.990
that when students use CommonLit
more frequently they tend

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.850
to have better reading
gains over time.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.760
So, where do we go from here?

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.200
We know that schools
and classrooms are

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.790
such important institutions for
developing civic engagement.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.860
And so, but we also
know that students,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.970
many students today struggle to
access the complex information

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.590
and primary and secondary
sources.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.390
So, our core competency is
digitizing these primary

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.930
and secondary sources and using
technology like text-to-speech,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.270
guided reading mode,
translation into 13 languages,

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.700
and read-aloud technology

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:18.430
to help struggling readers
access the information

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.500
in primary and secondary
sources.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.710
And so, over the next two years
we'll be digitizing this content

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.530
so that students not
only in reading class,

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:34.980
but also in history class can
access these wonderful texts.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.180
So, the great thing about tech
is that it's super-scalable

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:44.010
and we can deliver this solution
for about 25 cents per kid,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.010
that's the cost of buying
each child one pencil.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.470
And if we keep growing
at the rate

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:53.990
that we're growing
today we'll be on track

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.750
to serve 20 million students
by 2020, that's about half

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.130
of all public school
children in America.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:07.050
So, CommonLit is the tool I
wish I had when I was a teacher

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.560
in that classroom
in Mississippi.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.430
It delivers the kind of learning
experiences I would want

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:14.240
for my own child.

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:16.230
We are so humbled to be part

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.080
of the literacy best practice
awards with all of you

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.460
and I would love to
talk to many of you

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.830
about forming a partnership,
especially those of you

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:27.210
who are working internationally
because we've started

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.640
to see our tool getting picked
up all around the world.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.430
Thank you so much, here's
my contact information,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.480
I hope to connect with you.

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:41.340

of the Library of Congress.
