00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.455
Symmetric encryption algorithms are
typically block ciphers that take thick

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:05.160
size input.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.620
In this lesson, we will first discuss
the basic primitives of block ciphers,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.250
and then we will study the DES and
AES algorithms.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.070
We will also discuss how
to encrypt a large message

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.090
that has multiple blocks of input data,
and how to protect message integrity.
