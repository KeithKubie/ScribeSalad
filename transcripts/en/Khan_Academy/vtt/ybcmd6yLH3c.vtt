00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:01.288
- [Instructor] In the last videos,

00:00:01.288 --> 00:00:04.509
we saw a dominant Persia
have to put down a rebellion

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:08.125
by the Ionians in the Anatolian Peninsula,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.842
and they were really, really mad

00:00:09.842 --> 00:00:13.276
that these Ionians were
helped by the Athenians

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:15.074
and the Eretrians,

00:00:15.074 --> 00:00:18.517
and so Darius, the King of Kings goes off

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:21.321
to try to conquer and put down

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:23.912
the Athenians and the Eretrians.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:26.868
The first time he sends
a fleet in 492 BCE,

00:00:26.868 --> 00:00:28.839
it's destroyed by a storm.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.155
And we'll see this is not the last time

00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:32.912
that at least part of a Persian fleet

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:34.345
is destroyed by a storm.

00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:38.002
Then in 490, he sends a fleet again,

00:00:38.002 --> 00:00:40.867
and then he is defeated by the Athenians

00:00:40.867 --> 00:00:41.867
at Marathon,

00:00:42.787 --> 00:00:45.537
and we saw that right over there.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.439
Let me do that in color
you can actually see.

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:52.338
But as I mentioned in the last video,

00:00:52.338 --> 00:00:54.634
the Persians were not done.

00:00:54.634 --> 00:00:56.967
Darius would not live to see

00:00:58.698 --> 00:01:01.350
another round with the Greeks,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.541
but his successor, Xerxes, would not only

00:01:04.541 --> 00:01:09.529
try another attempt, but he
would amass a huge, huge force

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:14.151
against the Greeks to, in his
mind, finally take them over,

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.863
and he wants it done so badly

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:20.063
that he leads the forces himself.

00:01:20.063 --> 00:01:23.538
And so we are now 10 years after,

00:01:23.538 --> 00:01:26.575
10 years after the first Persian invasion.

00:01:26.575 --> 00:01:29.492
We are now at 480 BCE, where Xerxes

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:35.090
is going to try to invade
Greece by land and by sea,

00:01:38.593 --> 00:01:42.860
but as we will see, he is also
not going to be successful.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.872
But this second invasion
is the stuff of legend,

00:01:46.872 --> 00:01:50.418
and once again, the
historical accounts come to us

00:01:50.418 --> 00:01:53.475
primarily from Herodotus, who was Greek,

00:01:53.475 --> 00:01:56.432
and who was not a direct observer of this.

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:58.534
So you might want to take all
of this with a grain of salt,

00:01:58.534 --> 00:02:01.907
because it does make the
Greeks look awfully good.

00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:03.837
But we do think that
most of this happened,

00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:07.068
but obviously Herodotus probably

00:02:07.068 --> 00:02:08.561
added a little bit of bias there.

00:02:08.561 --> 00:02:11.257
We are likely to never know.

00:02:11.257 --> 00:02:12.824
So let's think about, or let's see

00:02:12.824 --> 00:02:15.074
what Xerxes attempts to do.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.902
So we see this magenta line.

00:02:18.902 --> 00:02:23.076
This is the line of
attack of Xerxes in 480,

00:02:23.076 --> 00:02:25.433
and you can see, there's one magenta line

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:27.183
that is going by sea,

00:02:29.136 --> 00:02:33.107
and one magenta line that
is going by sea here,

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:37.024
and another magenta line
that is going by land.

00:02:38.877 --> 00:02:41.269
And let's zoom in a little bit more.

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.150
I have another map here.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.817
So let's zoom in to
this map right over here

00:02:48.003 --> 00:02:50.847
to give us a clearer picture
of what's about to happen

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:53.668
in this next Persian invasion.

00:02:53.668 --> 00:02:56.408
So just to reorient ourselves,

00:02:56.408 --> 00:02:57.987
here are the land forces,

00:02:57.987 --> 00:03:01.215
and according to Herodotus
and historians of that time,

00:03:01.215 --> 00:03:03.189
they numbered this force

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:05.464
in potentially millions of soldiers,

00:03:05.464 --> 00:03:08.088
modern historians think it
was closer to 50 thousand

00:03:08.088 --> 00:03:10.317
to 300 thousand, we really don't know,

00:03:10.317 --> 00:03:13.057
but we think it's in the
approximately hundred thousand,

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.997
or a few hundred thousands, not millions,

00:03:14.997 --> 00:03:17.110
but by any measure, that is a huge,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.943
a huge military force.

00:03:19.815 --> 00:03:23.078
So this is hundreds of
thousands right over here.

00:03:23.078 --> 00:03:25.161
So hundreds of thousands.

00:03:26.108 --> 00:03:27.722
Or let me write this.

00:03:27.722 --> 00:03:31.820
Hundreds of thousands, maybe
between 50 and 300 thousand.

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.036
They're coming this
way, the Persian forces.

00:03:35.036 --> 00:03:39.203
And they also have a fleet
of approximately 1,200 ships.

00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:43.418
Now the Persians really
are not having good luck

00:03:43.418 --> 00:03:45.891
with weather whenever
they try to attack Greece.

00:03:45.891 --> 00:03:47.865
They face a storm, and about a third

00:03:47.865 --> 00:03:49.699
of their fleet is destroyed.

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:51.522
And so up here they are left with about,

00:03:51.522 --> 00:03:53.229
and these are all approximate,

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.201
remember this happened
over 2,000 years ago,

00:03:56.201 --> 00:03:58.024
roughly 2,500 years ago,

00:03:58.024 --> 00:04:01.193
so it's amazing that we know
anything about it at all,

00:04:01.193 --> 00:04:03.829
and obviously we have to rely on Herodotus

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.393
and whatever historical
accounts we can find.

00:04:07.393 --> 00:04:11.143
So the Persians are
invading by land and sea,

00:04:12.292 --> 00:04:15.253
and the Greeks have a strategy of

00:04:15.253 --> 00:04:19.142
let's try to stop them
by land at Thermopylae,

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:23.949
and stop them by sea at
the Straight of Artemisium

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:25.282
right over here.

00:04:27.107 --> 00:04:29.510
And there is some historical debate of

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.737
was this a big, grand
strategy to eventually

00:04:32.737 --> 00:04:36.720
try to defeat the Persians at Salamis,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.974
which eventually happens,

00:04:37.974 --> 00:04:41.387
or were they generally
trying to stop them there,

00:04:41.387 --> 00:04:43.186
and because they couldn't,

00:04:43.186 --> 00:04:45.764
they had to retreat back to Salamis.

00:04:45.764 --> 00:04:47.412
As we'll see, that second narrative

00:04:47.412 --> 00:04:48.573
is what actually happens.

00:04:48.573 --> 00:04:51.000
Well I guess in some level,
both of those narratives happen.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.123
That they are able to at
least slow down the Persians

00:04:54.123 --> 00:04:56.375
at both of these places, and the Persians

00:04:56.375 --> 00:05:00.323
are eventually defeated at
the Straight of Salamis.

00:05:00.323 --> 00:05:04.409
Now Thermopylae is the stuff of legends.

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:07.254
It is, if you've ever seen the movie 300,

00:05:07.254 --> 00:05:10.254
it is about the 300 Spartan soldiers

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:14.290
led by King Leonitus, along with roughly

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:16.925
7,000 other Greeks that
they're able to collect

00:05:16.925 --> 00:05:19.967
to stop the Persians at Thermopylae.

00:05:19.967 --> 00:05:22.846
And Thermopylae, you're
in this coastal area

00:05:22.846 --> 00:05:25.830
where there's a very limited area for

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.976
this massive Persian army
to be funneled through,

00:05:28.976 --> 00:05:32.540
and the Greeks are trying to stop them

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.108
at the Pass of Thermopylae.

00:05:34.108 --> 00:05:37.103
And you can see that right over there.

00:05:37.103 --> 00:05:39.402
And, by Herodotus's accounts,

00:05:39.402 --> 00:05:41.573
they are actually quite successful

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:44.243
because they are funneling
that Persian army

00:05:44.243 --> 00:05:45.787
into a very narrow space,

00:05:45.787 --> 00:05:47.808
the Spartans along with the other Greeks

00:05:47.808 --> 00:05:48.980
are able to push back.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.070
And this is a massive outnumbering.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.553
Roughly 7,000 versus many
tens or hundreds of thousands,

00:05:54.553 --> 00:05:57.136
but as Herodotus's accounts go,

00:05:59.882 --> 00:06:01.716
there was a traitor amongst the Greeks

00:06:01.716 --> 00:06:03.411
who would go to the Persians

00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:06.639
and show them another way around,

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.309
and show them another way around.

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:12.084
And so the Persians are
essentially able to,

00:06:12.084 --> 00:06:13.628
not only get around the Greeks,

00:06:13.628 --> 00:06:15.277
but by surrounding them, are
able to defeat the Greeks

00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:18.829
at Thermopylae and continue their march.

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:21.929
And remember, they were able
to get to Eretria before,

00:06:21.929 --> 00:06:23.926
10 years before, but
they really want to seek

00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:26.353
their revenge on Athens.

00:06:26.353 --> 00:06:28.895
And they are able to go to go Athens,

00:06:28.895 --> 00:06:30.834
but by the time they go there,

00:06:30.834 --> 00:06:33.087
they see that the town has been,

00:06:33.087 --> 00:06:34.700
for the most part, evacuated.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.802
That the Athenians, when they saw

00:06:36.802 --> 00:06:38.741
that the Persians were coming,

00:06:38.741 --> 00:06:42.537
they went to Salamis right over here.

00:06:42.537 --> 00:06:44.871
So even though Athens
was sacked and destroyed,

00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:47.494
the Athenian people were not destroyed.

00:06:47.494 --> 00:06:50.327
Now simultaneous with Thermopylae,

00:06:51.918 --> 00:06:56.085
you had a naval battle happen
in the Straight of Artemisium.

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:58.977
And once again, even
though there was about

00:06:58.977 --> 00:07:02.425
600 Persian ships that
were in this battle,

00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:05.316
there was on the order of
about 200 or 300 Greek ships,

00:07:05.316 --> 00:07:07.417
so the Greeks were once again outnumbered,

00:07:07.417 --> 00:07:09.089
and they were able to
slow down the Persians,

00:07:09.089 --> 00:07:10.482
but not stop them.

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:12.224
And the Persians kept having bad luck,

00:07:12.224 --> 00:07:13.849
especially with these storms,

00:07:13.849 --> 00:07:16.322
because even we had these
first ships get destroyed,

00:07:16.322 --> 00:07:19.747
they sent some 200 ships around Euboea,

00:07:19.747 --> 00:07:22.359
I'm probably not pronouncing
it perfectly right here,

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:25.656
but then they get destroyed by a storm.

00:07:25.656 --> 00:07:26.922
So now you have the ships

00:07:26.922 --> 00:07:31.055
that engaged the Greeks in
the Straight of Artemisium,

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:33.900
the Greeks pull back because
they know they're outnumbered,

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.988
and they essentially go in retreat,

00:07:36.988 --> 00:07:38.927
or what the Persians think are retreat,

00:07:38.927 --> 00:07:40.587
so the Persians follow the Greek fleet

00:07:40.587 --> 00:07:44.140
all the way back to the
Straight of Salamis.

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:48.307
And it's over there that
the Greek fleet is able to

00:07:50.816 --> 00:07:53.916
plan a defeat of the Persian fleet.

00:07:53.916 --> 00:07:56.273
So you have the Persian fleet gets

00:07:56.273 --> 00:07:58.084
destroyed decisively at Salamis,

00:07:58.084 --> 00:08:00.952
you have the Persian army still in Athens

00:08:00.952 --> 00:08:02.647
is able to destroy Athens,

00:08:02.647 --> 00:08:04.981
but the Athenian people
have not been destroyed,

00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:06.827
and so there's a question for Xerxes,

00:08:06.827 --> 00:08:08.092
what to do at this point.

00:08:08.092 --> 00:08:10.009
This is all in 480 BCE,

00:08:11.575 --> 00:08:13.421
and what Xerxes decides to do,

00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:16.451
he says hey I don't want
to get stranded in Europe

00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:18.924
at the edge of my empire,

00:08:18.924 --> 00:08:21.571
and so Xerxes heads back,

00:08:21.571 --> 00:08:25.404
but he leaves some of
his ground forces there,

00:08:26.494 --> 00:08:30.661
and they eventually face a
decisive defeat at Plataea,

00:08:31.556 --> 00:08:32.889
right over here.

00:08:34.435 --> 00:08:37.935
And so that is the last significant threat

00:08:38.777 --> 00:08:40.774
of the Persians against the Greeks.

00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.712
From then there the
Greco-Persian wars continue

00:08:43.712 --> 00:08:45.070
for the next several decades,

00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:46.602
for the next 20 or 30 years,

00:08:46.602 --> 00:08:49.667
but at that point it's more of
the Greeks on the offensive,

00:08:49.667 --> 00:08:51.072
and this really is the beginning

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:54.739
of the Golden Age of
the Greek civilization.
