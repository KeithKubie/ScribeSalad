Speaker 1:          00:00          My attention span I think has been shortened. Yeah. I'll sit down to watch a movie at home. I'm mean in 10 minutes I'm reaching for my phone. Yes. I'm not a heart surgeon. There's no emergency that need, you know? Right, right. It might be just be checking Twitter again or concern, you know? Um, so it's a perfect storm. Yeah. Of distractions and we now know is, is addictive. So yeah. How you turn that around. I, I mean it feels like there's a little bit of a movement of people to switch that stuff off and just read a book or go for a walk or, but yeah. You got to have real discipline. No, I mean, you're fighting against our fucking heroin addiction, man. Yeah. It's crazy. And everyone else is addicted to oh yeah. So you're not part of the conversation if you're not. I walked into a restaurant the other night and everyone was looking at their phone.

Speaker 1:          00:44          No one was looking at each other. I'm like, I'm in a movie. Yeah. This is a movie. So I'm posted public some. Yeah. I mean if, if instead of looking at their phones, if everyone was just looking at the sky, you'd be like, oh my God, there's a real problem. These people are sick. Yeah. Yeah. Something wrong. You know, if everybody's just sitting there with our hands open, like staring up at the sky and sitting next to each other, you'd be like, these people are sick. There's something wrong. They need help. Instead they're, they're looking at nothing. Yeah. They're checking their feed over and over again. Someone's complaining about Captain Marvel being a woman. Hey. Yeah. And all the experts. Are they the ones getting followed on there? Oh, I don't know who in experts, experts in whatever, you know, the ones who already, or are we looking at them?

Speaker 1:          01:25          You know, it should be this, this free flow of information where you can find out anything in your hand. What an incredible thing. Yeah. But it's not that. It's definitely not that well. I think there's two things. I think, one we didn't earn, it is just given to us. Right? It's not like we did all the work to curate all this technology and put it together and figuring out how to implement it in our deal. No, we just went to the fucking Verizon store and picked up a new phone. I mean, that's, that's what most people are doing. Yeah. And because of that, it's almost like being, um, like a trust fund kid or something like that. It's just all given to you. It's all handed to you all this, I felt, I feel the same way sometimes about weapons. I feel like the discipline required to learn how to use one and create it and build it, and then understand the responsibility of actually using it on a human being.

Speaker 1:          02:20          All that shit's out the window. You just go to the store and buy it. You know? There's no requirements of you other than you never killed anybody yet. Have you written, driven over anybody in your car? No. If you're robbed a bank, no. Okay. Yeah. You beating your wife? No. Okay. Here, here's a guy. Yeah. It's fucking strange. And this as, as a human being, the, the lack of discipline and accountability that, that we have in this ultimate access to all these things constantly and many of them become just massive distractions. And yeah, this in some ways is, is the utopia that people have dreamed of during the for generation. Sure, we're free of war. You're not going to get attacked in your house tonight. You're not going to starve and you have everything you could possibly need. So you'd think we'd become the perfect human beings in the absence of all those things that would have killed us in the past.

Speaker 1:          03:11          I would have made life hard in the past. Yeah. And again, that's, that's not what we're doing. Well, I don't think we operate very well without legitimate conflict, without legitimate conflict in terms of like actual things you need to worry about. Like I, when I used to live in the east coast, one of the things that was really noticeable was that when it snowed out, people were nicer. They help people and they're broken down the side of the road. They were nice to each other. There was a sense of vulnerability that we are all deeply entrenched in this winter nature thing and we've got to work together, otherwise we can't survive. Yeah. You know, and I think that applies to all aspects of life that when there's no real danger, people become extremely frivolous. Yeah. It's amazing how quickly we become lazy and complacent. Um, and actually the flip side of the negative stuff I was saying earlier, some good days I'll come back from Yemen, Syria, wherever.

Speaker 1:          04:06          I'll go out and I got a cup of coffee, coffee and I'll read the newspaper and I'll donate and I'll think, man, I'm the luckiest man alive. Yeah. The flip side, I can do this. Cause you do experience these horrific environments so you can appreciate it. Yeah. And the fact that we can, you know what I mean? Within a few hours here, we could have one of the best meals. Yeah. Possibly in the world we could, you know, it's, you know, it's, that's fitting incredible. So on good days that you can, you can, you can appreciate that. Again, this is you coming from these bad things. So it puts it in perspective. So yeah, I was just trying to try to back you up and say, yeah, like if you, if you're not, if you're not protected from all of that stuff then you can get to appreciate the basics.

Speaker 1:          04:41          Again, I was on this trip and Prince of Wales, we camped out on this island. It rained every day for six days, seven days. I mean we were soaked, you're soaked, everything soaked your sleeping bag. So tent soaked, everything came back home and it felt so good. Like I'd never felt the sun like that before. Like the sun was just this like this magic love glow that the sky was pouring down on the city. Everything felt so happy and I realized like, well you can't really appreciate this until it's taken away from you. Yeah, it's taken away from you. Then you understand what it is. So then you want to, when the kids of today grow up, what are they going to be like when everything has just been at their fingertips from day one forever. Forever. No mystery. They don't understand bullshitters either because like, like when I was a kid, people just a lie about shit and you really didn't know.

Speaker 1:          05:35          You're like, man, I don't know. He seems like he's full of Shit. You couldn't just yet have to go to an encyclopedia and you know, and actually read the information. Now you can go, okay, what year did this happen? And you pull up your phone kit though. Fuck Outta here. You know, people lie about being in the Olympics, they lied about this, they lied about that. They'll, yeah, it's um, it's good in that we have ultimate access to information for people that use it and understand what it is and appreciate it. It is good. But to your point, if there was a way to actually filter and say this is verifiable, this, yeah, this contains seven things, which are absolutely bullshit. We have no doubt about that whatsoever. If that could exist. Wonderful. But I mean, Fox, I've tried it. A few people have tried it, used to, it still feels like you end up being described as, you know, being on one side of the fight.

Speaker 1:          06:22          I almost feel like we need some sort of organized discipline, like maybe like a mandatory volunteer work, cleaning up impoverished communities are mandatory volunteer work doing their like, but I don't want people to have to do things like, um, I'm conflicted on that too, but I don't want people to have to do that. You know, like when there's countries that have mandatory military service, they seem to have an amazing feeling of, of patriotism in those countries and appreciation in those countries because they actually do have to join the military for two years or whatever it is. We don't have that over here.
