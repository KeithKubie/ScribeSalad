effectively you're talking about a
series of narrow valleys that are cut

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649
series of narrow valleys that are cut
 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.010
series of narrow valleys that are cut
off from the next Valley but our

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020
off from the next Valley but our
 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.100
