00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:22.270
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.880
I started shooting at the age
of 16, so about two years now.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.990
I started urban exploring
about last summer

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.330
when I started
linking up with people

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.360
that shoot with the
[INAUDIBLE] and stuff

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.670
and kind of got into the
whole urban exploring scene.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.300
I followed them on Instagram
because I liked their photos.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.650
And I just hit them up and
asked them if they want a shoot.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.040
That's how you meet new people,
and luckily the people I've met

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.150
are good friends of mine now.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.160
Instagram really
helped me get together

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.310
with all the other people that
had the same kind of interests

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.200
as me.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.850
And that wanted to like
urban explore New York City,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.970
and then I would also
bring my camera along.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.730
Back then when I first
started doing this,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.220
I didn't really know
much about photography.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.090
I did get a lot
of tips and tricks

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.420
from people I chill with and
hang out with that do photos.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.485
I just bring my camera
and shoot on auto,

00:01:24.485 --> 00:01:28.040
and eventually my friends
and people I've met

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.500
gained some pointers
and tips and tricks,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.200
and I started shooting
a manual and learned

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.435
how to really use my camera
to its full potential.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.320
Well, we met-- we
used to work together.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.380
We met at a coffee shot.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.530
And then one day after work, you
had brought your camera, right?

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.600
Yeah, I'm just going
to shoot around.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.410
He was like, oh, I know
this rooftop we can go on.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.160
I'm like all right,
let's go, and we went.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.560
The night after that, I
was out and he called me.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.140
And he's like oh, I just
climbed the Williamsburg Bridge.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.380
And I was like, oh, my God!

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.850
Yeah, we've been
arrested together.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.210
We were like-- they
already have our names.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.870
But, yeah, like 30
cops and a SWAT team.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.990
Yeah, SWAT too.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.470
They dragged us through
Times Square in cuffs.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.970
Yeah.

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.110
I mean, I think at first
they thought we were jumpers.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.065
So when they-- I remember
doing a couple of feet shots,

00:02:22.065 --> 00:02:24.190
and then looking down to
the lower part of the roof

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.220
and seeing the cops.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.330
I've been shooting
urban exploring

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.670
for about two years at most.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.442
It's probably, I guess, the most
exciting thing I've ever done.

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:35.650
That's all I can say, really.

00:02:44.445 --> 00:02:46.820
Especially being from Brooklyn,
New York, not many people

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.130
explore the city.

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.550
So, you know what I do is
I take it into my own hands

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.890
and I tend to go places I guess
where I'm not supposed to be.

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.860
I actually got into
photography a long time ago,

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.120
due to me being a
skateboard filmer at first.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.940
I guess sometimes we
abide by the same rules.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.170
Skateboarding and urban
exploring photography--

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.580
when you go to a
certain spot you

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.010
can't skate it because there's
usually a security guard there.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.960
When you're skating,
you want to be recorded.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.490
You want to be filmed just
like all the pro skaters.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.690
So when you get into that
idea of wanting to be filmed,

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.190
you tend to pick up the camera
and start shooting photos.

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.398
And mostly everybody that
I shoot photos with skates.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.790
For a while, me and
my friend [? Naisha ?]

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.480
had been scoping out a
432 Park [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.870
And we thought it was
a possible project

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.800
that we can maybe sneak into
the building and get to the top.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.345
So we decided to just go for it.

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.520
Eventually walked up all
the 90 flights of stairs

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.530
and got to the top.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.200
Nothing about the building
really specifically

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.820
made me want to climb it.

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.880
It was just tall
and it was there.

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.550
It was kind of our Everest.

00:04:10.897 --> 00:04:12.730
You never know which
doors going to be open.

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:14.680
You can just check a door
and a door just might open.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:15.595
You might get lucky.

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:17.490
Getting the shot and
knowing that you're

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:20.788
one of the few people
that have been here

00:04:20.788 --> 00:04:22.810
is a pretty awesome feeling.

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.560
It's an addiction.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.190
You get not only just wanting
to check out new stuff.

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.487
It's curiosity, but also
there's like an adrenaline rush

00:04:31.487 --> 00:04:32.789
associated with it.

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.080
The thrill of going places
where I'm not supposed to go

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.760
is the best part about it.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.050
The reason why I explore
is because each place

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.580
is relatively easy to
get to, and it just

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.650
amazes me that so
many people don't

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:48.800
get to see these places
just because they're

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.990
hiding from the public.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.720
I can do it, so I will do it.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.640
"All Points Project" is
a part of Seeker stories.
