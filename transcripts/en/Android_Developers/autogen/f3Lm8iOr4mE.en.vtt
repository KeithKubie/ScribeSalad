design and development so I spent a lot

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429
design and development so I spent a lot
 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.900
design and development so I spent a lot
of time on the main thread and I'm gonna

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910
of time on the main thread and I'm gonna
 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.639
of time on the main thread and I'm gonna
go through a lot of code today this is

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649
go through a lot of code today this is
 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.530
go through a lot of code today this is
i/o that's what you want right and so

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540

but don't worry about taking photos of

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
but don't worry about taking photos of
 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.819
but don't worry about taking photos of
the slides or worrying about referring

I want to talk to you about animations I

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730
I want to talk to you about animations I
 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.220
I want to talk to you about animations I
think animations are super important

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
think animations are super important
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.459
think animations are super important
hashtag animations matter and often I

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469
hashtag animations matter and often I
 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.689
hashtag animations matter and often I
think animations are thought of as

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699
think animations are thought of as
 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.880
think animations are thought of as
delight or polish or something sprinkled

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890
delight or polish or something sprinkled
 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.950
delight or polish or something sprinkled
on at the end of a development process

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960
on at the end of a development process
 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.420
on at the end of a development process
and I think that's a massive shame and I

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430
and I think that's a massive shame and I
 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.740
and I think that's a massive shame and I
think that contributes the reason why

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
think that contributes the reason why
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.359
think that contributes the reason why
they're often the first things on the

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369
they're often the first things on the
 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.520
they're often the first things on the
chopping block when time is tight and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530
chopping block when time is tight and
 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.240
chopping block when time is tight and
features a crunching animations I think

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250
features a crunching animations I think
 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.399
features a crunching animations I think
are really important for and usability

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
are really important for and usability
 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.440
are really important for and usability
of your application they can explain a

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450
of your application they can explain a
 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.179
of your application they can explain a
state change so that the user knows

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189
state change so that the user knows
 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.280
state change so that the user knows
what's going on they can establish a

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290
what's going on they can establish a
 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.440
what's going on they can establish a
spatial model so that you have a sense

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
spatial model so that you have a sense
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.969
spatial model so that you have a sense
of place within the application

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979
of place within the application
 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.710
of place within the application
or they can hint at how you can interact

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
or they can hint at how you can interact
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.780
or they can hint at how you can interact
with them so they're very important in

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790
with them so they're very important in
 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.030
with them so they're very important in
my opinion but I think animations are

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040
my opinion but I think animations are
 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.730
my opinion but I think animations are
currently under threat and that's due to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740
currently under threat and that's due to
 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.960
currently under threat and that's due to
changes in the way that we are

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
changes in the way that we are
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.600
changes in the way that we are
architecting our applications so there's

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610
architecting our applications so there's
 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.639
architecting our applications so there's
a movement towards and having the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649
a movement towards and having the
 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.859
a movement towards and having the
controller of your application be

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869
controller of your application be
 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.050
controller of your application be
outside of the view layer right and it's

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
outside of the view layer right and it's
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.130
outside of the view layer right and it's
something like a view model then

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140
something like a view model then
 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.160
something like a view model then
publishes and a state of the application

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
publishes and a state of the application
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.499
publishes and a state of the application
so a UI model view state whatever you

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509
so a UI model view state whatever you
 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.480
so a UI model view state whatever you
might call it is essentially and the

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
might call it is essentially and the
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.160
might call it is essentially and the
entire state of your application and

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170
entire state of your application and
 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.450
entire state of your application and
needed to render on the screen and as

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460
needed to render on the screen and as
 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.950
needed to render on the screen and as
things change in your back-end say a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960
things change in your back-end say a
 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.569
things change in your back-end say a
network request comes in or the user

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579
network request comes in or the user
 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.029
network request comes in or the user
performs an action and interaction this

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039
performs an action and interaction this
 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.979
performs an action and interaction this
updates the state in your view model and

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989
updates the state in your view model and
 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.170
updates the state in your view model and
they publish a new version of this UI

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180
they publish a new version of this UI
 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.160
they publish a new version of this UI
state there's lots of benefits

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170
state there's lots of benefits
 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.809
state there's lots of benefits
this kind of architecture such as being

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819
this kind of architecture such as being
 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.190
this kind of architecture such as being
able to reason about the entire state

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200
able to reason about the entire state
 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.320
able to reason about the entire state
for application at once and or easier

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330
for application at once and or easier
 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.610
for application at once and or easier
testing and so on and so forth but I'm

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620
testing and so on and so forth but I'm
 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.080
testing and so on and so forth but I'm
not going to go into those today I'd

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090
not going to go into those today I'd
 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.940
not going to go into those today I'd
encourage you to check out

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950
encourage you to check out
 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.309
encourage you to check out
unidirectional data flow or patterns

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319
unidirectional data flow or patterns
 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:27.089
unidirectional data flow or patterns
such as MPI

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099
such as MPI
 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.670
such as MPI
or even libraries such as Mavericks or

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680
or even libraries such as Mavericks or

Mobius for helping to implement this

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
Mobius for helping to implement this
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.350
Mobius for helping to implement this
what I do want to talk about is the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360
what I do want to talk about is the
 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.150
what I do want to talk about is the
observers of this stream of data at the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160
observers of this stream of data at the
 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.309
observers of this stream of data at the
other end so when you get these stream

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319
other end so when you get these stream
 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.340
other end so when you get these stream
of UI models you then need to bind it to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350
of UI models you then need to bind it to
 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.650
of UI models you then need to bind it to
your into your views to set these values

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
your into your views to set these values
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.920
your into your views to set these values
to set up the state of your views now

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
to set up the state of your views now
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.350
to set up the state of your views now
having the stream of mui models is kind

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360
having the stream of mui models is kind
 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.000
having the stream of mui models is kind
of like a pure function you want to have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010
of like a pure function you want to have
 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.130
of like a pure function you want to have
this like pure input and perform an

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140
this like pure input and perform an
 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.479
this like pure input and perform an
action it essentially wants to be very

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489
action it essentially wants to be very
 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.770
action it essentially wants to be very
stateless on the other side animations

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780
stateless on the other side animations
 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.600
stateless on the other side animations
essentially very stateful they want to

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610
essentially very stateful they want to
 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.550
essentially very stateful they want to
know about set they're all about setting

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560
know about set they're all about setting
 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.070
know about set they're all about setting
a value from one value to another value

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080
a value from one value to another value
 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.350
a value from one value to another value
over a period of time so this I think is

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360
over a period of time so this I think is
 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.970
over a period of time so this I think is
the ultimate tension right now but this

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980
the ultimate tension right now but this
 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.530
the ultimate tension right now but this
moves this new architecture it's

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540
moves this new architecture it's
 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.050
moves this new architecture it's
becoming harder to kind of join these

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060
becoming harder to kind of join these
 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.530
becoming harder to kind of join these
two stateless and stateful and worlds so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540
two stateless and stateful and worlds so
 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.140
two stateless and stateful and worlds so
today I want to focus in on some tools

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150
today I want to focus in on some tools
 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.030
today I want to focus in on some tools
and some techniques that you can use in

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040
and some techniques that you can use in
 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.340
and some techniques that you can use in
your applications right now in order to

your applications right now in order to
 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.470
your applications right now in order to
enable you to do animations because I

think it's a shame I think a lot of

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560
think it's a shame I think a lot of
 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.560
think it's a shame I think a lot of
people are finding it hard to kind of

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
people are finding it hard to kind of
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.090

square this circle to kind of marry

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:30.100
square this circle to kind of marry
 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.640

these two and models and as such I think

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650
these two and models and as such I think
 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.860
these two and models and as such I think
animations are under threat so to look

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870
animations are under threat so to look
 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.120
animations are under threat so to look
at these metals and techniques let's

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
at these metals and techniques let's
 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.520
at these metals and techniques let's
start off with a simple minimum viable

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530
start off with a simple minimum viable
 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.140
start off with a simple minimum viable
screen where we have some kind of logon

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150
screen where we have some kind of logon
 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.000
screen where we have some kind of logon
form and when you hit logon and

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010
form and when you hit logon and
 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.670
form and when you hit logon and
crucially I don't want I want to hide

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680

the login button and show you some kind

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030
the login button and show you some kind
 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.580
the login button and show you some kind
of progress spinner but I don't want it

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590
of progress spinner but I don't want it
 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.099
of progress spinner but I don't want it
just to blink out of visibility and

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109
just to blink out of visibility and
 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.259
just to blink out of visibility and
change I want it to animate out and the

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269
change I want it to animate out and the
 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.789
change I want it to animate out and the
spinner to animate in so the UI model

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799
spinner to animate in so the UI model
 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.140

the state for this screen might look

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150
the state for this screen might look
 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.640
the state for this screen might look
something like this a simple data class

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650
something like this a simple data class
 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.199
something like this a simple data class
with a couple of billions about what's

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209
with a couple of billions about what's
 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.069
with a couple of billions about what's
going on and you can then bind this into

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079
going on and you can then bind this into
 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.020
going on and you can then bind this into
your your view layer to your application

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030

using some kind of library functions

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430
using some kind of library functions
 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.970
using some kind of library functions
like this where set visibility in this

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980
like this where set visibility in this
 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.890
like this where set visibility in this
static well before we animate it does

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900
static well before we animate it does
 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300
static well before we animate it does
something very simple like setting the

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
something very simple like setting the
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.460
something very simple like setting the
views visibility and based on that

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470
views visibility and based on that
 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:22.920
views visibility and based on that
boolean state so how can we animate

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930
boolean state so how can we animate
 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.830
boolean state so how can we animate
something like this

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840
something like this
 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.720
something like this
so a and

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730
so a and
 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:28.920
so a and
you're kind of naive way to do this

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930
you're kind of naive way to do this
 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.780
you're kind of naive way to do this
might be something like this where we're

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790
might be something like this where we're
 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.150
might be something like this where we're
just running a animation - in this

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160
just running a animation - in this
 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.420
just running a animation - in this
example fade in of you or when we're

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430
example fade in of you or when we're
 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.670
example fade in of you or when we're
fading it out we have to of course set

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680
fading it out we have to of course set
 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.080
fading it out we have to of course set
the visibility to gone because otherwise

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090
the visibility to gone because otherwise
 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.760
the visibility to gone because otherwise
the button stays present in the

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770
the button stays present in the
 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.590
the button stays present in the
hierarchy receiving touches and so forth

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600
hierarchy receiving touches and so forth
 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.030
hierarchy receiving touches and so forth
so we all notice we're all Android yes

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040
so we all notice we're all Android yes
 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.440
so we all notice we're all Android yes
we have to use the Alpha property and

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:46.450
we have to use the Alpha property and
 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.350
we have to use the Alpha property and
then set the visibility as well but

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360
then set the visibility as well but
 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.150
then set the visibility as well but
doing something like this and might

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160
doing something like this and might
 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.640
doing something like this and might
yield to interesting results like for

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650
yield to interesting results like for
 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.320
yield to interesting results like for
example just doing that is actually

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330
example just doing that is actually
 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.030
example just doing that is actually
running you can see every time I do a

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040
running you can see every time I do a
 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.800
running you can see every time I do a
keystroke here hopefully you see the

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810
keystroke here hopefully you see the
 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:00.480
keystroke here hopefully you see the
spinner kind of like shows up briefly

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490
spinner kind of like shows up briefly
 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.920
spinner kind of like shows up briefly
and then fades out which is not what I

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930
and then fades out which is not what I
 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.810
and then fades out which is not what I
wanted or if I managed to actually

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820
wanted or if I managed to actually
 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.580
wanted or if I managed to actually
finish the form and hit the login button

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590
finish the form and hit the login button
 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.590
finish the form and hit the login button
and we see some weirdness going on where

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600
and we see some weirdness going on where
 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.970
and we see some weirdness going on where
they're kind of overlapping and then all

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980
they're kind of overlapping and then all
 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:10.560
they're kind of overlapping and then all
of a sudden both views are gone and like

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570
of a sudden both views are gone and like
 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.650
of a sudden both views are gone and like
what's going on there essentially what

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660
what's going on there essentially what
 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.510
what's going on there essentially what
is going on is with this model where

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520
is going on is with this model where
 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.490
is going on is with this model where

at once you can get into some corner

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480
at once you can get into some corner
 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.360
at once you can get into some corner
cases which you have to consider ahead

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370
cases which you have to consider ahead
 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.730
cases which you have to consider ahead
of time and I actually would like to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740
of time and I actually would like to
 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.560
of time and I actually would like to
propose free kind of principles or

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:25.570
propose free kind of principles or
 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:26.940
propose free kind of principles or
tenants which one would make a good

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950
tenants which one would make a good
 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.400
tenants which one would make a good
animation in this world which are that

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:29.410
animation in this world which are that
 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.930

they should be reentrant continuous and

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940
they should be reentrant continuous and
 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.720
they should be reentrant continuous and
smooth let's look at each of these so

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:33.730
smooth let's look at each of these so
 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:35.220
smooth let's look at each of these so
the first step reentrant is a fancy

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:35.230
the first step reentrant is a fancy
 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.840
the first step reentrant is a fancy
computer science word for essentially

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850
computer science word for essentially
 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.330
computer science word for essentially
the your your function should be able to

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340
the your your function should be able to
 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.130
the your your function should be able to
be interrupted and called again at any

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:41.140
be interrupted and called again at any
 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.190
be interrupted and called again at any

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:58.800
being published and while the animation
is still running you need to be able to

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810
is still running you need to be able to

one is continuous and if you look at

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:04.900
one is continuous and if you look at

color as I touch it I think looks fine
 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:12.300

if I kind of touch it and it scales to
 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.920
if I kind of touch it and it scales to
completion I let go and it scales back

changing a value over time like that's
 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:36.750
changing a value over time like that's
kind of what an animation is if we're

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760
kind of what an animation is if we're
 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.130
kind of what an animation is if we're
not going to prepared for this new value

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:38.140
not going to prepared for this new value
 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.260
not going to prepared for this new value
coming in at a certain time you can have

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270
coming in at a certain time you can have
 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.380
coming in at a certain time you can have
something like this

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:41.390
something like this
 

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.820
something like this
where we're midway through one curve and

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830
where we're midway through one curve and
 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.230
where we're midway through one curve and
then suddenly we jump and we have this

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240
then suddenly we jump and we have this
 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.200
then suddenly we jump and we have this
discontinuity which is which lead to the

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210
discontinuity which is which lead to the
 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.740
discontinuity which is which lead to the
most poor user experience and the last

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:50.750
most poor user experience and the last
 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.510
most poor user experience and the last
tenant I wanna propose is one of

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520
tenant I wanna propose is one of
 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.760
tenant I wanna propose is one of
smoothness and by which I mean take this

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:54.770
smoothness and by which I mean take this
 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.830
smoothness and by which I mean take this
example where I'm animating a view to

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:56.840
example where I'm animating a view to
 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.270
example where I'm animating a view to
either the top left or top right then

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:58.280
either the top left or top right then
 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.910
either the top left or top right then
depending on pushing this button if and

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:00.920
depending on pushing this button if and
 

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.920
depending on pushing this button if and
now I hit the top right button twice you

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930
now I hit the top right button twice you
 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.660
now I hit the top right button twice you
can see it slows down and then animates

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670
can see it slows down and then animates
 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.200
can see it slows down and then animates
again because a new event came in it

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210
again because a new event came in it
 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:10.330
again because a new event came in it
kicked off a new animation and but

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340
kicked off a new animation and but
 

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.950
kicked off a new animation and but
because the animate each animation had

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960
because the animate each animation had
 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.780
because the animate each animation had
the same duration it leads to this kind

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:13.790
the same duration it leads to this kind
 

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:17.320
the same duration it leads to this kind
of like discontinuity in the velocity so

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:17.330
of like discontinuity in the velocity so
 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:18.670
of like discontinuity in the velocity so
it slows down and this kind of looks

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680
it slows down and this kind of looks
 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.950
it slows down and this kind of looks
kind of terrible similarly if I can

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960
kind of terrible similarly if I can
 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.570
kind of terrible similarly if I can
retarget it so it's going one way and

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:22.580
retarget it so it's going one way and
 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:25.180
retarget it so it's going one way and
then I send it off to the left I left it

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:25.190
then I send it off to the left I left it
 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.070
then I send it off to the left I left it
in to the right you can see it just kind

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080
in to the right you can see it just kind
 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.130
in to the right you can see it just kind
of stops suddenly and then reverses

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:30.140
of stops suddenly and then reverses
 

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:32.440
of stops suddenly and then reverses
direction now nothing in the real world

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:32.450
direction now nothing in the real world
 

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:34.510
direction now nothing in the real world
and kind of like has this instantaneous

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:34.520
and kind of like has this instantaneous
 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.430
and kind of like has this instantaneous
change interaction or velocity and so

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:36.440
change interaction or velocity and so
 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.210
change interaction or velocity and so
this feels very unnatural to us so let's

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:40.220
this feels very unnatural to us so let's
 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:41.740
this feels very unnatural to us so let's
look at solving these problems in our

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:41.750
look at solving these problems in our
 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.560
look at solving these problems in our
code so first up let's take a look at

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:44.570
code so first up let's take a look at
 

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.180
code so first up let's take a look at
that continuous property that it jumped

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:46.190
that continuous property that it jumped
 

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.460
that continuous property that it jumped
midway through and you can see here and

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:48.470
midway through and you can see here and
 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:50.290
midway through and you can see here and
that I've kind of made some assumptions

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:50.300
that I've kind of made some assumptions
 

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:51.370
that I've kind of made some assumptions
read that when you want to show

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:51.380
read that when you want to show
 

00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:52.630
read that when you want to show
something that you I'm going to animate

00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:52.640
something that you I'm going to animate
 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.460
something that you I'm going to animate
this visibility it's alpha property so

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:54.470
this visibility it's alpha property so
 

00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:58.360
this visibility it's alpha property so
from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 so this is kind of

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:58.370
from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 so this is kind of
 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:07:59.290
from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 so this is kind of
like making the assumption of the

00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.300
like making the assumption of the
 

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.180
like making the assumption of the
current value what we can and do with

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:01.190
current value what we can and do with
 

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:03.400
current value what we can and do with
animators instead is just remove that

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:03.410
animators instead is just remove that
 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:06.190
animators instead is just remove that
initial value so just say animate to

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:06.200
initial value so just say animate to
 

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:08.380
initial value so just say animate to
this value and the way the object

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:08.390
this value and the way the object
 

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.150
this value and the way the object
animator and property system works is

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.160
animator and property system works is
 

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:13.300
animator and property system works is
the property here alpha both tells you

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:13.310
the property here alpha both tells you
 

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.640
the property here alpha both tells you
how to set the kind of animated value on

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:15.650
how to set the kind of animated value on
 

00:08:15.650 --> 00:08:17.290
how to set the kind of animated value on
the view as well but also offers how to

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:17.300
the view as well but also offers how to
 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:19.720
the view as well but also offers how to
get it so if you omit the from value it

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:19.730
get it so if you omit the from value it
 

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:22.240
get it so if you omit the from value it
will read the views current alpha and

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:22.250
will read the views current alpha and
 

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:23.560
will read the views current alpha and
it'll start from there which is what we

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:23.570
it'll start from there which is what we
 

00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:24.850
it'll start from there which is what we
want we don't want the value to jump

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:24.860
want we don't want the value to jump
 

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.300
want we don't want the value to jump
around so that was easily solved and but

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:28.310
around so that was easily solved and but
 

00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.410
around so that was easily solved and but
let's take a look at the reentrant

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:29.420
let's take a look at the reentrant
 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.540
let's take a look at the reentrant
problem that's slightly before Nia and

00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:31.550
problem that's slightly before Nia and
 

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:33.640
problem that's slightly before Nia and
so the reentrant property essentially is

00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:33.650
so the reentrant property essentially is
 

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.320
so the reentrant property essentially is
that we want to be able to call this at

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:35.330
that we want to be able to call this at
 

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:37.300
that we want to be able to call this at
any time and not have any kind of side

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:37.310
any time and not have any kind of side
 

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:38.980
any time and not have any kind of side
effects lingering around so essentially

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:38.990
effects lingering around so essentially
 

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.300
effects lingering around so essentially
what we need to do is clean up after

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:40.310
what we need to do is clean up after
 

00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:41.770
what we need to do is clean up after
ourselves we need to kind of cancel any

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:41.780
ourselves we need to kind of cancel any
 

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.620
ourselves we need to kind of cancel any
running animation that's going on but if

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:44.630
running animation that's going on but if
 

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.810
running animation that's going on but if
you look at this code here and we're not

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:46.820
you look at this code here and we're not
 

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:48.280
you look at this code here and we're not
actually holding a reference to the

00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.290
actually holding a reference to the
 

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.020
actually holding a reference to the
animations right we just create them and

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:50.030
animations right we just create them and
 

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:51.730
animations right we just create them and
the cool star and then forget about them

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:51.740
the cool star and then forget about them
 

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.050
the cool star and then forget about them
there's no reference held onto it

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:54.060
there's no reference held onto it
 

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:58.470
there's no reference held onto it
so what we can do is fix that actually

00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480
so what we can do is fix that actually
 

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:01.020
so what we can do is fix that actually
first before that would then let's not

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.030
first before that would then let's not
 

00:09:01.030 --> 00:09:03.060
first before that would then let's not
run an animation if we don't need to so

00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.070
run an animation if we don't need to so
 

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.950
run an animation if we don't need to so
in that instance where I was typing

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:04.960
in that instance where I was typing
 

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.600
in that instance where I was typing
typing typing and it was like all the

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:06.610
typing typing and it was like all the
 

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:09.450
typing typing and it was like all the
time saying I want the again spinner to

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:09.460
time saying I want the again spinner to
 

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:10.110
time saying I want the again spinner to
be invisible

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:10.120
be invisible
 

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.850
be invisible
it was always running that animation but

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:11.860
it was always running that animation but
 

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.470
it was always running that animation but
we want to actually skip that animation

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:13.480
we want to actually skip that animation
 

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.690
we want to actually skip that animation
if you don't need to so here what we're

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:15.700
if you don't need to so here what we're
 

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:16.890
if you don't need to so here what we're
simply doing was saying if we're

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:16.900
simply doing was saying if we're
 

00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:18.090
simply doing was saying if we're
targeting like you know if we're going

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.100
targeting like you know if we're going
 

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.650
targeting like you know if we're going
to go fade it out to zero if it's

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:19.660
to go fade it out to zero if it's
 

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.930
to go fade it out to zero if it's
already faded out just return early so

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:21.940
already faded out just return early so
 

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:23.850
already faded out just return early so
bail early so short-circuit the method

00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:23.860
bail early so short-circuit the method
 

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:29.130
bail early so short-circuit the method
and but yeah if we wanted to cancel our

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:29.140
and but yeah if we wanted to cancel our
 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:30.900
and but yeah if we wanted to cancel our
running animation and there's kind of

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:30.910
running animation and there's kind of
 

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:32.610
running animation and there's kind of
like mid progress then we need to kind

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:32.620
like mid progress then we need to kind
 

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.170
like mid progress then we need to kind
of store it somewhere so that we can

00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:34.180
of store it somewhere so that we can
 

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.410
of store it somewhere so that we can
have access to the animator to cancel it

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420
have access to the animator to cancel it
 

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.390
have access to the animator to cancel it
such that we can when a new invocation

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:39.400
such that we can when a new invocation
 

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.370
such that we can when a new invocation
comes around we can cancel any running

00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:41.380
comes around we can cancel any running
 

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.280
comes around we can cancel any running
animations and before setting up the new

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:44.290
animations and before setting up the new
 

00:09:44.290 --> 00:09:46.560
animations and before setting up the new
animation so we could do this we could

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:46.570
animation so we could do this we could
 

00:09:46.570 --> 00:09:47.670
animation so we could do this we could
store it somewhere but where would you

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:47.680
store it somewhere but where would you
 

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.290
store it somewhere but where would you
store it these functions are essentially

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:49.300
store it these functions are essentially
 

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:51.420
store it these functions are essentially
kind of pure functions that's kind of an

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:51.430
kind of pure functions that's kind of an
 

00:09:51.430 --> 00:09:53.910
kind of pure functions that's kind of an
static so the only option really is to

00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920
static so the only option really is to
 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.700
static so the only option really is to
store it really in the view itself but

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:56.710
store it really in the view itself but
 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.880
store it really in the view itself but
view already offers such a method for

00:09:59.880 --> 00:09:59.890
view already offers such a method for
 

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:00.990
view already offers such a method for
this it actually has something called a

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:01.000
this it actually has something called a
 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.520
this it actually has something called a
view property animator which is what's

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.530
view property animator which is what's
 

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.990
view property animator which is what's
returned we call viewed or animates

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:04.000
returned we call viewed or animates
 

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.470
returned we call viewed or animates
which allows you to do this kind of get

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480
which allows you to do this kind of get
 

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.690
which allows you to do this kind of get
access retrieve any running cut and

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:09.700
access retrieve any running cut and
 

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.150
access retrieve any running cut and
animations so if we swap out our code

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160
animations so if we swap out our code
 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.040
animations so if we swap out our code
from using object animator to using view

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:14.050
from using object animator to using view
 

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.620
from using object animator to using view
view property animator instead then we

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:16.630
view property animator instead then we
 

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:18.720
view property animator instead then we
get some of these properties so what

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:18.730
get some of these properties so what
 

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:20.100
get some of these properties so what
happens here is when you call view dot

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.110
happens here is when you call view dot
 

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.250
happens here is when you call view dot
animate if there's already an animation

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:23.260
animate if there's already an animation
 

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.140
animate if there's already an animation
running over that same property it will

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:25.150
running over that same property it will
 

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.480
running over that same property it will
be canceled for us and then the new

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:27.490
be canceled for us and then the new
 

00:10:27.490 --> 00:10:29.550
be canceled for us and then the new
animation will be run so that's exactly

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560
animation will be run so that's exactly
 

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:33.150
animation will be run so that's exactly
what we want even more and view property

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160
what we want even more and view property
 

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.540
what we want even more and view property
animator offers this with end action API

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.550
animator offers this with end action API
 

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.940
animator offers this with end action API
which takes a runnable so the cool thing

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:38.950
which takes a runnable so the cool thing
 

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:41.760
which takes a runnable so the cool thing
about this is this this action will only

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:41.770
about this is this this action will only
 

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.830
about this is this this action will only
be invoked if the animation runs to

00:10:43.830 --> 00:10:43.840
be invoked if the animation runs to
 

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.870
be invoked if the animation runs to
completion it won't be invoked if the

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:45.880
completion it won't be invoked if the
 

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.640
completion it won't be invoked if the
animation is canceled so if a new value

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:47.650
animation is canceled so if a new value
 

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.830
animation is canceled so if a new value
comes in then the old animation is

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:49.840
comes in then the old animation is
 

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.890
comes in then the old animation is
canceled and the action is only runs if

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:52.900
canceled and the action is only runs if
 

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.630
canceled and the action is only runs if
it completes which is exactly the kind

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640
it completes which is exactly the kind
 

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:58.170
it completes which is exactly the kind
of properties that we want there's still

00:10:58.170 --> 00:10:58.180
of properties that we want there's still
 

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.940
of properties that we want there's still
a few problems with this system here

00:10:59.940 --> 00:10:59.950
a few problems with this system here
 

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.800
a few problems with this system here
though so what happens if we're midway

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:01.810
though so what happens if we're midway
 

00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:03.960
though so what happens if we're midway
through an animation well we just said

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:03.970
through an animation well we just said
 

00:11:03.970 --> 00:11:05.220
through an animation well we just said
that it's going to cancel the previous

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:05.230
that it's going to cancel the previous
 

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:06.640
that it's going to cancel the previous
animation and run it and you

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:06.650
animation and run it and you
 

00:11:06.650 --> 00:11:09.040
animation and run it and you
so that's going to violate our smooth

00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:09.050
so that's going to violate our smooth
 

00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.050
so that's going to violate our smooth
property because if we're already

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:11.060
property because if we're already
 

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.120
property because if we're already
animating to the right target value in a

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.130
animating to the right target value in a
 

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:15.280
animating to the right target value in a
new value comes in it will still kind of

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:15.290
new value comes in it will still kind of
 

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.780
new value comes in it will still kind of
cancel it and start again so you'll get

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:16.790
cancel it and start again so you'll get
 

00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.620
cancel it and start again so you'll get
this kind of like stutter change in it

00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:19.630
this kind of like stutter change in it
 

00:11:19.630 --> 00:11:22.600
this kind of like stutter change in it
we could for example store the current

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:22.610
we could for example store the current
 

00:11:22.610 --> 00:11:24.670
we could for example store the current
value that and the animator is running

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:24.680
value that and the animator is running
 

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.500
value that and the animator is running
is kind of currently animating too and

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:26.510
is kind of currently animating too and
 

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:28.270
is kind of currently animating too and
if a new update to the same value comes

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:28.280
if a new update to the same value comes
 

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.880
if a new update to the same value comes
in we could perhaps skip that update but

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:30.890
in we could perhaps skip that update but
 

00:11:30.890 --> 00:11:31.930
in we could perhaps skip that update but
that's not going to help us out in the

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:31.940
that's not going to help us out in the
 

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:33.490
that's not going to help us out in the
case where we're trying to retarget to a

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:33.500
case where we're trying to retarget to a
 

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:35.350
case where we're trying to retarget to a
new value that comes in we way through

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360
new value that comes in we way through
 

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:38.260
new value that comes in we way through
an animation so how we're going to solve

00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.270
an animation so how we're going to solve
 

00:11:38.270 --> 00:11:41.230
an animation so how we're going to solve
this problem of smoothness and whether

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:41.240
this problem of smoothness and whether
 

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.190
this problem of smoothness and whether
there's actually a library out there

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:42.200
there's actually a library out there
 

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.300
there's actually a library out there
which I think a lot of developers

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:43.310
which I think a lot of developers
 

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:44.920
which I think a lot of developers
haven't really paid much attention to

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:44.930
haven't really paid much attention to
 

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.340
haven't really paid much attention to
which is the physics based property and

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:48.350
which is the physics based property and
 

00:11:48.350 --> 00:11:50.860
which is the physics based property and
animation system and I think maybe

00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:50.870
animation system and I think maybe
 

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:52.000
animation system and I think maybe
people who have skipped it because we

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.010
people who have skipped it because we
 

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:54.040
people who have skipped it because we
look at and some of the samples or demos

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.050
look at and some of the samples or demos
 

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:55.870
look at and some of the samples or demos
or even our developer documentation here

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:55.880
or even our developer documentation here
 

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.370
or even our developer documentation here
and they see things like these bouncy

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:57.380
and they see things like these bouncy
 

00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:59.620
and they see things like these bouncy
animations and think hey that's you know

00:11:59.620 --> 00:11:59.630
animations and think hey that's you know
 

00:11:59.630 --> 00:12:01.480
animations and think hey that's you know
fine if I want to make a bouncy effect

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:01.490
fine if I want to make a bouncy effect
 

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.030
fine if I want to make a bouncy effect
but it's not for me for general UI kind

00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040
but it's not for me for general UI kind
 

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:06.130
but it's not for me for general UI kind
of animation that's a shame

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:06.140
of animation that's a shame
 

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:07.360
of animation that's a shame
because you can actually very easily

00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:07.370
because you can actually very easily
 

00:12:07.370 --> 00:12:09.910
because you can actually very easily
turn off the bounciness and what's left

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920
turn off the bounciness and what's left
 

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.790
turn off the bounciness and what's left
is a very powerful physics based system

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800
is a very powerful physics based system
 

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.230
is a very powerful physics based system
which has a number of properties which

00:12:14.230 --> 00:12:14.240
which has a number of properties which
 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.730
which has a number of properties which
are useful for these kind of cases that

00:12:15.730 --> 00:12:15.740
are useful for these kind of cases that
 

00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:19.240
are useful for these kind of cases that
we're trying to solve so for example if

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:19.250
we're trying to solve so for example if
 

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:20.710
we're trying to solve so for example if
you return to our square going to the

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720
you return to our square going to the
 

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:23.110
you return to our square going to the
left or right and we run it with a

00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120
left or right and we run it with a
 

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.060
left or right and we run it with a
physics-based and a spring system

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:25.070
physics-based and a spring system
 

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:27.880
physics-based and a spring system
underneath it because it has a physics

00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:27.890
underneath it because it has a physics
 

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:29.470
underneath it because it has a physics
system underneath it when you retarget

00:12:29.470 --> 00:12:29.480
system underneath it when you retarget
 

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:31.480
system underneath it when you retarget
it to a new value it maintains things

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:31.490
it to a new value it maintains things
 

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.520
it to a new value it maintains things
like the velocity for you and it gives

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:33.530
like the velocity for you and it gives
 

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.690
like the velocity for you and it gives
us these properties we're looking for

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:34.700
us these properties we're looking for
 

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.850
us these properties we're looking for
where and if you try and go to the same

00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:36.860
where and if you try and go to the same
 

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.330
where and if you try and go to the same
place twice

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:37.340
place twice
 

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.860
place twice
it maintains the velocity even though

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:38.870
it maintains the velocity even though
 

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:40.870
it maintains the velocity even though
it's starting a new animation or if you

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880
it's starting a new animation or if you
 

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.630
it's starting a new animation or if you
retarget to an another destination it

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:43.640
retarget to an another destination it
 

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.610
retarget to an another destination it
slows down and changes direction very

00:12:45.610 --> 00:12:45.620
slows down and changes direction very
 

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:48.130
slows down and changes direction very
very smoothly by maintaining the

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:48.140
very smoothly by maintaining the
 

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:51.400
very smoothly by maintaining the
velocity for you so if you haven't

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:51.410
velocity for you so if you haven't
 

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:53.140
velocity for you so if you haven't
looked at Springs the API looks very

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:53.150
looked at Springs the API looks very
 

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.720
looked at Springs the API looks very
similar to the animated system where you

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:55.730
similar to the animated system where you
 

00:12:55.730 --> 00:12:59.470
similar to the animated system where you
have a subject being animated a property

00:12:59.470 --> 00:12:59.480
have a subject being animated a property
 

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.880
have a subject being animated a property
which you want to animate here the

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:00.890
which you want to animate here the
 

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:03.640
which you want to animate here the
translation X a target value and then

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:03.650
translation X a target value and then
 

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:06.310
translation X a target value and then
you call start on it but for me the real

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:06.320
you call start on it but for me the real
 

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.230
you call start on it but for me the real
power comes when you instead of using

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.240
power comes when you instead of using
 

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.030
power comes when you instead of using
start you use this animate to final

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040
start you use this animate to final
 

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.940
start you use this animate to final
position API and what this does is if

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:12.950
position API and what this does is if
 

00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:14.830
position API and what this does is if
the animation isn't started it will just

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:14.840
the animation isn't started it will just
 

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.290
the animation isn't started it will just
kick it off but crucially if an

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:17.300
kick it off but crucially if an
 

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.510
kick it off but crucially if an
animation is running and

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:19.520
animation is running and
 

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:21.790
animation is running and
then it will retarget it and this will

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800
then it will retarget it and this will
 

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.560
then it will retarget it and this will
do that magic of maintaining the

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:23.570
do that magic of maintaining the
 

00:13:23.570 --> 00:13:25.900
do that magic of maintaining the
velocity for us and updating the target

00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:25.910
velocity for us and updating the target
 

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.060
velocity for us and updating the target
buddy

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:27.070
buddy
 

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:29.889
buddy
so the key thing there was if the

00:13:29.889 --> 00:13:29.899
so the key thing there was if the
 

00:13:29.899 --> 00:13:31.840
so the key thing there was if the
animation was already running so we want

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:31.850
animation was already running so we want
 

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:33.160
animation was already running so we want
something like the view property

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:33.170
something like the view property
 

00:13:33.170 --> 00:13:35.590
something like the view property
animator we saw before which held onto a

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600
animator we saw before which held onto a
 

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.570
animator we saw before which held onto a
reference to any running animation such

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:37.580
reference to any running animation such
 

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:39.790
reference to any running animation such
that we can access it and cancel it or

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800
that we can access it and cancel it or
 

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.000
that we can access it and cancel it or
update it and unfortunately view doesn't

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.010
update it and unfortunately view doesn't
 

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.120
update it and unfortunately view doesn't
have you know get spring method or you

00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:46.130
have you know get spring method or you
 

00:13:46.130 --> 00:13:47.889
have you know get spring method or you
know like like animate has so that it

00:13:47.889 --> 00:13:47.899
know like like animate has so that it
 

00:13:47.899 --> 00:13:50.650
know like like animate has so that it
can return you a handy one of these so

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:50.660
can return you a handy one of these so
 

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.680
can return you a handy one of these so
let's build one and so this is an

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:53.690
let's build one and so this is an
 

00:13:53.690 --> 00:13:54.940
let's build one and so this is an
extension property I've been playing

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:54.950
extension property I've been playing
 

00:13:54.950 --> 00:13:56.980
extension property I've been playing
with and the solution function excuse me

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:56.990
with and the solution function excuse me
 

00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:00.639
with and the solution function excuse me
adding an on view whereby you pass it a

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:00.649
adding an on view whereby you pass it a
 

00:14:00.649 --> 00:14:02.139
adding an on view whereby you pass it a
property a view pops you onto animates

00:14:02.139 --> 00:14:02.149
property a view pops you onto animates
 

00:14:02.149 --> 00:14:03.639
property a view pops you onto animates
this is things like translation X or

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:03.649
this is things like translation X or
 

00:14:03.649 --> 00:14:05.769
this is things like translation X or
alpha or so on and it will return you a

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:05.779
alpha or so on and it will return you a
 

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:08.230
alpha or so on and it will return you a
spring animation and what I do is I

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:08.240
spring animation and what I do is I
 

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.620
spring animation and what I do is I
stash the running spring as a tag on the

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:11.630
stash the running spring as a tag on the
 

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.620
stash the running spring as a tag on the
view so it can hold on to it so going

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:14.630
view so it can hold on to it so going
 

00:14:14.630 --> 00:14:16.030
view so it can hold on to it so going
through it here what I do is I map the

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:16.040
through it here what I do is I map the
 

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.790
through it here what I do is I map the
property to a key such that you can

00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800
property to a key such that you can
 

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.590
property to a key such that you can
store it in the tag and then try and

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600
store it in the tag and then try and
 

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:22.660
store it in the tag and then try and
retrieve it from the views tag system so

00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:22.670
retrieve it from the views tag system so
 

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:24.069
retrieve it from the views tag system so
if there's one already running will get

00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079
if there's one already running will get
 

00:14:24.079 --> 00:14:26.560
if there's one already running will get
access to that or if it's not if there

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:26.570
access to that or if it's not if there
 

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:28.300
access to that or if it's not if there
isn't one already set up already stored

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:28.310
isn't one already set up already stored
 

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.220
isn't one already set up already stored
then we'll create a new spring animation

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:30.230
then we'll create a new spring animation
 

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:32.590
then we'll create a new spring animation
and store it in the views tag and then

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:32.600
and store it in the views tag and then
 

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.260
and store it in the views tag and then
return it so a handy little and you know

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:35.270
return it so a handy little and you know
 

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.750
return it so a handy little and you know
small extension function like this it

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:37.760
small extension function like this it
 

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:39.460
small extension function like this it
helps you get access to a spring for a

00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:39.470
helps you get access to a spring for a
 

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.920
helps you get access to a spring for a
given view and what that means is that

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:41.930
given view and what that means is that
 

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.990
given view and what that means is that
we can at the call site to have a nice

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000
we can at the call site to have a nice
 

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.120
we can at the call site to have a nice
clean something like this well you just

00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:46.130
clean something like this well you just
 

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:49.030
clean something like this well you just
do view dot spring for the translation X

00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040
do view dot spring for the translation X
 

00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:50.889
do view dot spring for the translation X
and the crucially this will either

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:50.899
and the crucially this will either
 

00:14:50.899 --> 00:14:54.850
and the crucially this will either
return you a new spring animation or one

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:54.860
return you a new spring animation or one
 

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.560
return you a new spring animation or one
that's already running which is exactly

00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:56.570
that's already running which is exactly
 

00:14:56.570 --> 00:14:58.210
that's already running which is exactly
what we want and then we can use that

00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.220
what we want and then we can use that
 

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.480
what we want and then we can use that
animate to final position syntax and to

animate to final position syntax and to
 

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.300
animate to final position syntax and to
update a running animation so what might

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:04.310
update a running animation so what might

update a running animation so what might
this look like in our binding function

this look like in our binding function
 

00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.410
this look like in our binding function
that we're talking about so here we were

that we're talking about so here we were
 

00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:09.550
that we're talking about so here we were
we were using the view property animator

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:09.560
we were using the view property animator
 

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:12.069
we were using the view property animator
we can sub this out use the extension

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079
we can sub this out use the extension
 

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:15.100
we can sub this out use the extension
function and grab access to the or

noticed I kind of we would regress some

00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880
noticed I kind of we would regress some
 

00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.280
noticed I kind of we would regress some
functionality there we lost the end

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.290

a faff you have to be a bit careful the
 

00:16:02.839 --> 00:16:04.329
a faff you have to be a bit careful the
way you write these animations that you

way you write these animations that you
 

00:16:04.339 --> 00:16:05.979
way you write these animations that you
have to be careful that they are

reentrant especially but the nice thing
 

00:16:08.569 --> 00:16:09.699
reentrant especially but the nice thing
is that you kind of write these

00:16:09.699 --> 00:16:09.709
is that you kind of write these
 

00:16:09.709 --> 00:16:11.289
is that you kind of write these

00:16:20.049 --> 00:16:20.059
and then you can use them throughout
 

00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:21.699
and then you can use them throughout
your code base use them in a number of

00:16:21.699 --> 00:16:21.709
your code base use them in a number of
 

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:22.989
your code base use them in a number of
places you just write them a couple of

00:16:22.989 --> 00:16:22.999
places you just write them a couple of
 

00:16:22.999 --> 00:16:24.939
places you just write them a couple of
times and correctly and then use them

00:16:24.939 --> 00:16:24.949
times and correctly and then use them
 

00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:28.840
times and correctly and then use them
for route and now looking at Springs are

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:28.850
for route and now looking at Springs are
 

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.129
for route and now looking at Springs are
kind of simplified the creation a little

00:16:30.129 --> 00:16:30.139
kind of simplified the creation a little
 

00:16:30.139 --> 00:16:31.590
kind of simplified the creation a little
bit so just like when you create an

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600
bit so just like when you create an
 

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.669
bit so just like when you create an
object animator or view property

00:16:33.669 --> 00:16:33.679
object animator or view property
 

00:16:33.679 --> 00:16:35.019
object animator or view property
animator you've probably customized

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:35.029
animator you've probably customized
 

00:16:35.029 --> 00:16:36.669
animator you've probably customized
things like the interpolation or the

00:16:36.669 --> 00:16:36.679
things like the interpolation or the
 

00:16:36.679 --> 00:16:39.129
things like the interpolation or the
duration and Springs don't really have

00:16:39.129 --> 00:16:39.139
duration and Springs don't really have
 

00:16:39.139 --> 00:16:40.539
duration and Springs don't really have
those concepts because their physics

00:16:40.539 --> 00:16:40.549
those concepts because their physics
 

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:41.679
those concepts because their physics
base they have kind of things that

00:16:41.679 --> 00:16:41.689
base they have kind of things that
 

00:16:41.689 --> 00:16:43.090
base they have kind of things that
describe the physics system underneath

00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.100
describe the physics system underneath
 

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.669
describe the physics system underneath
it so as sites you probably wanted to do

00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:45.679
it so as sites you probably wanted to do
 

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:48.069
it so as sites you probably wanted to do
like customize the spring forces to set

00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079
like customize the spring forces to set
 

00:16:48.079 --> 00:16:50.679
like customize the spring forces to set
the damping ratio and the stiffness so

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:50.689
the damping ratio and the stiffness so
 

00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:51.850
the damping ratio and the stiffness so
the damping ratio controls that

00:16:51.850 --> 00:16:51.860
the damping ratio controls that
 

00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.859
the damping ratio controls that
bounciness we just talked about and the

00:16:53.859 --> 00:16:53.869
bounciness we just talked about and the
 

00:16:53.869 --> 00:16:56.350
bounciness we just talked about and the
stiffness and controls like how fast the

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:56.360
stiffness and controls like how fast the
 

00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.340
stiffness and controls like how fast the
spring moves to equilibrium state so if

00:17:00.340 --> 00:17:00.350
spring moves to equilibrium state so if
 

00:17:00.350 --> 00:17:01.359
spring moves to equilibrium state so if
you don't set these you'll get these

00:17:01.359 --> 00:17:01.369
you don't set these you'll get these
 

00:17:01.369 --> 00:17:03.189
you don't set these you'll get these
default values and it's kind of like

00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199
default values and it's kind of like
 

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:05.740
default values and it's kind of like
medium bouncy or medium stiffness which

00:17:05.740 --> 00:17:05.750
medium bouncy or medium stiffness which
 

00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:07.689
medium bouncy or medium stiffness which
is kind of what we saw in an example

00:17:07.689 --> 00:17:07.699
is kind of what we saw in an example
 

00:17:07.699 --> 00:17:10.120
is kind of what we saw in an example
before and but I found there's some kind

00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:10.130
before and but I found there's some kind
 

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.949
before and but I found there's some kind
of default values that could generally

00:17:11.949 --> 00:17:11.959
of default values that could generally
 

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:14.620
of default values that could generally
applicable for UI work so and I added

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:14.630
applicable for UI work so and I added
 

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:16.269
applicable for UI work so and I added
these to the extension function to make

00:17:16.269 --> 00:17:16.279
these to the extension function to make
 

00:17:16.279 --> 00:17:18.250
these to the extension function to make
it and very easy to get this kind of

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:18.260
it and very easy to get this kind of
 

00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:21.009
it and very easy to get this kind of
some default and behavior that works

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:21.019
some default and behavior that works
 

00:17:21.019 --> 00:17:22.809
some default and behavior that works
well for most cases so turning off the

00:17:22.809 --> 00:17:22.819
well for most cases so turning off the
 

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.009
well for most cases so turning off the
bouncing that's got all together and

00:17:24.009 --> 00:17:24.019
bouncing that's got all together and
 

00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:26.049
bouncing that's got all together and
setting a slightly higher stiffness

00:17:26.049 --> 00:17:26.059
setting a slightly higher stiffness
 

00:17:26.059 --> 00:17:27.850
setting a slightly higher stiffness
ratio but because their default

00:17:27.850 --> 00:17:27.860
ratio but because their default
 

00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:29.320
ratio but because their default
parameters it makes it super easy that

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:29.330
parameters it makes it super easy that
 

00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.879
parameters it makes it super easy that
you can just pass an alternate value at

00:17:30.879 --> 00:17:30.889
you can just pass an alternate value at
 

00:17:30.889 --> 00:17:32.350
you can just pass an alternate value at
the call site if you want to customize

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:32.360
the call site if you want to customize
 

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.240
the call site if you want to customize
an animation to make it slightly snap

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:34.250
an animation to make it slightly snap
 

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.810
an animation to make it slightly snap
here for example so to give you a kind

00:17:37.810 --> 00:17:37.820
here for example so to give you a kind
 

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:39.789
here for example so to give you a kind
of a real example of this and they're

00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799
of a real example of this and they're
 

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:40.870
of a real example of this and they're
going to take a look at a recycler view

00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880
going to take a look at a recycler view
 

00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.960
going to take a look at a recycler view
item animator so recyclerview does a lot

00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:43.970
item animator so recyclerview does a lot
 

00:17:43.970 --> 00:17:46.240
item animator so recyclerview does a lot
of stuff for you right so using digital

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:46.250
of stuff for you right so using digital
 

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.900
of stuff for you right so using digital
and fine

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:46.910
and fine
 

00:17:46.910 --> 00:17:48.310
and fine
grayned a tap to updates it will give

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320
grayned a tap to updates it will give
 

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.440
grayned a tap to updates it will give
you free animations essentially so in

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:50.450
you free animations essentially so in
 

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.000
you free animations essentially so in
this example I've got a grid and then

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:52.010
this example I've got a grid and then
 

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:53.050
this example I've got a grid and then
when I hit the shuffle button it's

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:53.060
when I hit the shuffle button it's
 

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.090
when I hit the shuffle button it's
moving some items around so this is with

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:55.100
moving some items around so this is with
 

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.440
moving some items around so this is with
the default item animator and you can

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:56.450
the default item animator and you can
 

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:58.990
the default item animator and you can
see it's got that kind of you know just

00:17:58.990 --> 00:17:59.000
see it's got that kind of you know just
 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.330
see it's got that kind of you know just
continuous or not very smooth and it's

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:01.340
continuous or not very smooth and it's
 

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.730
continuous or not very smooth and it's
continuous but not very smooth

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:02.740
continuous but not very smooth
 

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.830
continuous but not very smooth
animations when items come in we can sub

00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:05.840
animations when items come in we can sub
 

00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:07.420
animations when items come in we can sub
this out for this kind of spring based

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:07.430
this out for this kind of spring based
 

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:09.880
this out for this kind of spring based
system and we can see that when item the

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:09.890
system and we can see that when item the
 

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:11.200
system and we can see that when item the
new updates come in you can see that

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:11.210
new updates come in you can see that
 

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:12.940
new updates come in you can see that
they smoothly animates the final place

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:12.950
they smoothly animates the final place
 

00:18:12.950 --> 00:18:15.670
they smoothly animates the final place
and this might seem like a kind of toy

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:15.680
and this might seem like a kind of toy
 

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.380
and this might seem like a kind of toy
example for slides but this is probably

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:17.390
example for slides but this is probably
 

00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:18.700
example for slides but this is probably
quite close to what's actually happening

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:18.710
quite close to what's actually happening
 

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.950
quite close to what's actually happening
in your apps how many apps grab stuff on

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960
in your apps how many apps grab stuff on
 

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.000
in your apps how many apps grab stuff on
the internet and shove it into a

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:22.010
the internet and shove it into a
 

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:24.130
the internet and shove it into a
recycler view and you know this is

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:24.140
recycler view and you know this is
 

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.780
recycler view and you know this is
obviously like an asynchronous operation

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:25.790
obviously like an asynchronous operation
 

00:18:25.790 --> 00:18:27.580
obviously like an asynchronous operation
so updates can come in at any time or

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:27.590
so updates can come in at any time or
 

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.470
so updates can come in at any time or
maybe you scroll and you um information

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:29.480
maybe you scroll and you um information
 

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.290
maybe you scroll and you um information
is coming in but I kind of like thinking

00:18:32.290 --> 00:18:32.300
is coming in but I kind of like thinking
 

00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.670
is coming in but I kind of like thinking
about and making the animations that

00:18:33.670 --> 00:18:33.680
about and making the animations that
 

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:35.770
about and making the animations that
happen when this asynchronous data here

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:35.780
happen when this asynchronous data here
 

00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:37.780
happen when this asynchronous data here
kind of comes back and as smooth as

00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:37.790
kind of comes back and as smooth as
 

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.250
kind of comes back and as smooth as
possible you can really kind of like

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:39.260
possible you can really kind of like
 

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.750
possible you can really kind of like
improve the user experience in your app

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:40.760
improve the user experience in your app
 

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:44.680
improve the user experience in your app
and so this is a kind of slight

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:44.690
and so this is a kind of slight
 

00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.390
and so this is a kind of slight
simplification of the code because I'm

00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400
simplification of the code because I'm
 

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.610
simplification of the code because I'm
extending default item animator is a

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:48.620
extending default item animator is a
 

00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.040
extending default item animator is a
little bit involved and but essentially

00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:51.050
little bit involved and but essentially
 

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:53.230
little bit involved and but essentially
it comes down to setting up some

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240
it comes down to setting up some
 

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.120
it comes down to setting up some
translations on some views and then when

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:55.130
translations on some views and then when
 

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.500
translations on some views and then when
you want to animate it you just animate

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:56.510
you want to animate it you just animate
 

00:18:56.510 --> 00:18:58.870
you want to animate it you just animate
those translations back down to zero so

00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880
those translations back down to zero so
 

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.400
those translations back down to zero so
we just use the exact same extension

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:00.410
we just use the exact same extension
 

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:02.620
we just use the exact same extension
function we looked at before to create

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:02.630
function we looked at before to create
 

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.360
function we looked at before to create
or grab an already running spring

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:04.370
or grab an already running spring
 

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:05.770
or grab an already running spring
animation over the translation

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:05.780
animation over the translation
 

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:07.660
animation over the translation
properties and animate them down to zero

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:07.670
properties and animate them down to zero
 

00:19:07.670 --> 00:19:10.060
properties and animate them down to zero
and this is essentially what it gets to

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:10.070
and this is essentially what it gets to
 

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:11.950
and this is essentially what it gets to
give you that kind of nice smooth

00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960
give you that kind of nice smooth
 

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.570
give you that kind of nice smooth
behavior and I'll put this in there just

00:19:13.570 --> 00:19:13.580
behavior and I'll put this in there just
 

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.140
behavior and I'll put this in there just
in case anyone wants to take a look so

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:17.150
in case anyone wants to take a look so
 

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.690
in case anyone wants to take a look so
we just kind of general approach to how

00:19:19.690 --> 00:19:19.700
we just kind of general approach to how
 

00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.970
we just kind of general approach to how

in states and to views which can be
super powerful if you want to then use

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.740
can then power running the right
transition whenever you set one of your

00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:26.750
transition whenever you set one of your
 

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:30.370
transition whenever you set one of your
custom states onto a view and the way

00:22:30.370 --> 00:22:30.380
custom states onto a view and the way
 

00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:32.169
custom states onto a view and the way
you do this is it looks quite similar to

00:22:32.169 --> 00:22:32.179
you do this is it looks quite similar to
 

00:22:32.179 --> 00:22:34.330
you do this is it looks quite similar to
defining custom attributes for a custom

00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:34.340
defining custom attributes for a custom
 

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.850
defining custom attributes for a custom
view you can define it in a terse file

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:36.860
view you can define it in a terse file
 

00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.940
view you can define it in a terse file
the states you want to support and then

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:39.950
the states you want to support and then
 

00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:41.650
the states you want to support and then
we actually wrapped up this behavior

00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:41.660
we actually wrapped up this behavior
 

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:43.150
we actually wrapped up this behavior
into an enum because there were a few

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:43.160
into an enum because there were a few
 

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.500
into an enum because there were a few
things we wanted to change when their

00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:44.510
things we wanted to change when their
 

00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:46.500
things we wanted to change when their
button changes States so not just the

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:46.510
button changes States so not just the
 

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:49.390
button changes States so not just the
state this kind of this attribute state

00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400
state this kind of this attribute state
 

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.250
state this kind of this attribute state
but also we wanted to change the content

00:22:51.250 --> 00:22:51.260
but also we wanted to change the content
 

00:22:51.260 --> 00:22:52.540
but also we wanted to change the content
description or some text that gets

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:52.550
description or some text that gets
 

00:22:52.550 --> 00:22:53.860
description or some text that gets
displayed with the buttons we wrap this

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:53.870
displayed with the buttons we wrap this
 

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.600
displayed with the buttons we wrap this
all up into a innumerous States and

00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:55.610
all up into a innumerous States and
 

00:22:55.610 --> 00:22:59.680
all up into a innumerous States and
setting this draw the attribute a state

00:22:59.680 --> 00:22:59.690
setting this draw the attribute a state
 

00:22:59.690 --> 00:23:02.770
setting this draw the attribute a state
as well as these other things then we

00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:02.780
as well as these other things then we
 

00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:05.919
as well as these other things then we
extend the app compat button image

00:23:05.919 --> 00:23:05.929
extend the app compat button image
 

00:23:05.929 --> 00:23:08.560
extend the app compat button image
button class in this case and a couple

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:08.570
button class in this case and a couple
 

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:08.970
button class in this case and a couple
things

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:08.980
things
 

00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:11.230
things
first we have to expose a property which

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:11.240
first we have to expose a property which
 

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.549
first we have to expose a property which
is one of these enum values and

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559
is one of these enum values and
 

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.860
is one of these enum values and
crucially in that whenever that changes

00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:14.870
crucially in that whenever that changes
 

00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:17.530
crucially in that whenever that changes
we call refresh drawable state this is

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:17.540
we call refresh drawable state this is
 

00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.030
we call refresh drawable state this is
your hook into the view system to say

00:23:19.030 --> 00:23:19.040
your hook into the view system to say
 

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.160
your hook into the view system to say
hey my state has changed and that in

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:21.170
hey my state has changed and that in
 

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:23.799
hey my state has changed and that in
turn will kick off the later updates to

00:23:23.799 --> 00:23:23.809
turn will kick off the later updates to
 

00:23:23.809 --> 00:23:27.010
turn will kick off the later updates to
actually run the transitions the other

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:27.020
actually run the transitions the other
 

00:23:27.020 --> 00:23:28.120
actually run the transitions the other
thing you have to do is you have to

00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:28.130
thing you have to do is you have to
 

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.280
thing you have to do is you have to
override on create drawable state which

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:30.290
override on create drawable state which
 

00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.600
override on create drawable state which
is essentially how you're telling the

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:31.610
is essentially how you're telling the
 

00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:33.280
is essentially how you're telling the
system what state you're and currently

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:33.290
system what state you're and currently
 

00:23:33.290 --> 00:23:35.290
system what state you're and currently
in so here you have to call this merge

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:35.300
in so here you have to call this merge
 

00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.630
in so here you have to call this merge
drawable States method and pass in your

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640
drawable States method and pass in your
 

00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.250
drawable States method and pass in your
current state this is the kind of

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:39.260
current state this is the kind of
 

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.110
current state this is the kind of
attribute resource which if I expand it

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120
attribute resource which if I expand it
 

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:42.850
attribute resource which if I expand it
out from the enum value is this int

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:42.860
out from the enum value is this int
 

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.380
out from the enum value is this int
array of the state that you're currently

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:44.390
array of the state that you're currently
 

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:49.570
array of the state that you're currently
in so by doing this we can get some

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:49.580
in so by doing this we can get some
 

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.780
in so by doing this we can get some
pretty and powerful behavior so we can

00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:51.790
pretty and powerful behavior so we can
 

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.250
pretty and powerful behavior so we can
have these like transitions between all

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:54.260
have these like transitions between all
 

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:56.470
have these like transitions between all
these and given States but as you saw

00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480
these and given States but as you saw
 

00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:59.140
these and given States but as you saw
you know this can get quite and you know

00:23:59.140 --> 00:23:59.150
you know this can get quite and you know
 

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.340
you know this can get quite and you know
quite a lot because there's six

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:00.350
quite a lot because there's six
 

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.510
quite a lot because there's six
different states if you want to be able

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520
different states if you want to be able
 

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.549
different states if you want to be able
to animate between each and every one of

00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559
to animate between each and every one of
 

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:04.840
to animate between each and every one of
those states you basically end it with

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:04.850
those states you basically end it with
 

00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:07.000
those states you basically end it with
an n-by-n problem so you'd have to kind

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:07.010
an n-by-n problem so you'd have to kind
 

00:24:07.010 --> 00:24:09.549
an n-by-n problem so you'd have to kind
of define 36 different transitions there

00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559
of define 36 different transitions there
 

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:12.310
of define 36 different transitions there
which sounds and pretty hard so what we

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320
which sounds and pretty hard so what we
 

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.010
which sounds and pretty hard so what we
did instead is we had a policy of always

00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.020
did instead is we had a policy of always
 

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.600
did instead is we had a policy of always
going through an intermediary state this

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:16.610
going through an intermediary state this
 

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:18.460
going through an intermediary state this
pending state we see the hourglass going

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:18.470
pending state we see the hourglass going
 

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:19.180
pending state we see the hourglass going
round and round

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:19.190
round and round
 

00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.220
round and round
so as search if you wanted to go from

00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.230
so as search if you wanted to go from
 

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:24.549
so as search if you wanted to go from
reservable to reserved and you always go

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559
reservable to reserved and you always go
 

00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:26.500
reservable to reserved and you always go
for this intermediary state and that

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:26.510
for this intermediary state and that
 

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:28.029
for this intermediary state and that
import made us

00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039
import made us
 

00:24:28.039 --> 00:24:29.320

that cut down the number of transitions

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:29.330
that cut down the number of transitions
 

00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:31.659
that cut down the number of transitions
that we had to run from n-by-n to just

00:24:31.659 --> 00:24:31.669
that we had to run from n-by-n to just
 

00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:34.960
that we had to run from n-by-n to just
to n so we only had to write 12 animated

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:34.970
to n so we only had to write 12 animated
 

00:24:34.970 --> 00:24:36.669
to n so we only had to write 12 animated
vectors luckily I like writing animated

00:24:36.669 --> 00:24:36.679
vectors luckily I like writing animated
 

00:24:36.679 --> 00:24:40.659
vectors luckily I like writing animated
vectors and if you're running a lucky

00:24:40.659 --> 00:24:40.669
vectors and if you're running a lucky
 

00:24:40.669 --> 00:24:42.519

enough to be running on API 23 or beyond

00:24:42.519 --> 00:24:42.529
enough to be running on API 23 or beyond
 

00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:44.440

as your main SDK then you can use the

00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:44.450
as your main SDK then you can use the
 

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:46.509
as your main SDK then you can use the
platform's animated vector drawable

00:24:46.509 --> 00:24:46.519

one which also supports reversing and so

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:51.289
one which also supports reversing and so
 

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:52.869

you can only write n just six different

00:24:52.869 --> 00:24:52.879
you can only write n just six different
 

00:24:52.879 --> 00:24:54.340
you can only write n just six different
Ran's issues and have them reverse when

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:54.350

just yet one note about doing this kind

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:01.340
just yet one note about doing this kind
 

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.680
just yet one note about doing this kind
of thing is that we wanted to have this

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:02.690
of thing is that we wanted to have this
 

00:25:02.690 --> 00:25:04.659
of thing is that we wanted to have this
nice intermediate state where it's like

00:25:04.659 --> 00:25:04.669
nice intermediate state where it's like
 

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:07.529
nice intermediate state where it's like
animating there our class and one

00:25:07.529 --> 00:25:07.539
animating there our class and one
 

00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:10.239

current limitation of the animated

00:25:10.239 --> 00:25:10.249
current limitation of the animated
 

00:25:10.249 --> 00:25:11.710
current limitation of the animated
vector drawable class is that you can't

00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:11.720
vector drawable class is that you can't
 

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:15.430
vector drawable class is that you can't
a repeat count on animator set you can

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:15.440
a repeat count on animator set you can
 

00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.139
a repeat count on animator set you can
only set it on leaf animator object

00:25:17.139 --> 00:25:17.149
only set it on leaf animator object
 

00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:18.879
only set it on leaf animator object
object animators so here we're I'm

00:25:18.879 --> 00:25:18.889
object animators so here we're I'm
 

00:25:18.889 --> 00:25:20.979

which is infinite so just infinitely

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:22.970
which is infinite so just infinitely

animate you have to be able to structure

00:25:25.359 --> 00:25:25.369
animate you have to be able to structure

animate you have to be able to structure
animations in such a way to achieve this

00:25:28.469 --> 00:25:28.479
animations in such a way to achieve this
 

00:25:28.479 --> 00:25:31.119
animations in such a way to achieve this
so how does the animate stateless Rob

00:25:31.119 --> 00:25:31.129
so how does the animate stateless Rob
 

00:25:31.129 --> 00:25:32.799
so how does the animate stateless Rob
will help us against these kind of goals

00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:32.809
will help us against these kind of goals
 

00:25:32.809 --> 00:25:36.219
will help us against these kind of goals
which I set out for my animations they

00:25:36.219 --> 00:25:36.229
which I set out for my animations they

state it will cancel everything and it

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:43.700
state it will cancel everything and it
 

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.190
state it will cancel everything and it
will start the new transition for me

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:45.200
will start the new transition for me
 

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:45.999
will start the new transition for me
automatically

00:25:45.999 --> 00:25:46.009
automatically
 

00:25:46.009 --> 00:25:48.789
automatically
it's neither continuous or smooth so it

00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799
it's neither continuous or smooth so it
 

00:25:48.799 --> 00:25:50.229
it's neither continuous or smooth so it
won't kind of like you for halfway

00:25:50.229 --> 00:25:50.239
won't kind of like you for halfway
 

00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:51.849
won't kind of like you for halfway
through an animation do some kind of

00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:51.859
through an animation do some kind of
 

00:25:51.859 --> 00:25:54.489
through an animation do some kind of
magic to move from that halfway state to

00:25:54.489 --> 00:25:54.499
magic to move from that halfway state to
 

00:25:54.499 --> 00:25:57.159
magic to move from that halfway state to
the end state you've defined and but I

00:25:57.159 --> 00:25:57.169
the end state you've defined and but I
 

00:25:57.169 --> 00:25:59.710
the end state you've defined and but I
think this is pretty useful for a class

00:25:59.710 --> 00:25:59.720
think this is pretty useful for a class
 

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:00.999
think this is pretty useful for a class
which is out the box you don't have to

00:26:00.999 --> 00:26:01.009
which is out the box you don't have to
 

00:26:01.009 --> 00:26:02.499
which is out the box you don't have to
write any code essentially you just have

00:26:02.499 --> 00:26:02.509
write any code essentially you just have
 

00:26:02.509 --> 00:26:04.479
write any code essentially you just have
to provide different transitions relate

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:04.489
to provide different transitions relate
 

00:26:04.489 --> 00:26:06.729
to provide different transitions relate
between the states and so it's a really

00:26:06.729 --> 00:26:06.739
between the states and so it's a really
 

00:26:06.739 --> 00:26:08.859
between the states and so it's a really
handy class to have in your tool belt if

00:26:08.859 --> 00:26:08.869
handy class to have in your tool belt if
 

00:26:08.869 --> 00:26:11.019
handy class to have in your tool belt if
you need to animate and the transition

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:11.029
you need to animate and the transition
 

00:26:11.029 --> 00:26:14.680
you need to animate and the transition
of drawables closely related or similar

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:14.690
of drawables closely related or similar
 

00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.239
of drawables closely related or similar
concept really to animate state of this

00:26:16.239 --> 00:26:16.249
concept really to animate state of this
 

00:26:16.249 --> 00:26:18.219
concept really to animate state of this
robot is this state list animator which

00:26:18.219 --> 00:26:18.229
robot is this state list animator which
 

00:26:18.229 --> 00:26:19.859
robot is this state list animator which
is actually do similar things for views

00:26:19.859 --> 00:26:19.869
is actually do similar things for views
 

00:26:19.869 --> 00:26:22.239
is actually do similar things for views
so for example in this application I

00:26:22.239 --> 00:26:22.249
so for example in this application I
 

00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:24.879
so for example in this application I
have some kind of frederick conversation

00:26:24.879 --> 00:26:24.889
have some kind of frederick conversation
 

00:26:24.889 --> 00:26:26.619
have some kind of frederick conversation
and when you select a single comment i

00:26:26.619 --> 00:26:26.629
and when you select a single comment i
 

00:26:26.629 --> 00:26:28.119
and when you select a single comment i
wanted to have this kind of transition

00:26:28.119 --> 00:26:28.129
wanted to have this kind of transition
 

00:26:28.129 --> 00:26:30.609
wanted to have this kind of transition
where i animate the elevation and the

00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:30.619
where i animate the elevation and the
 

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:32.589
where i animate the elevation and the
background color of the selected content

00:26:32.589 --> 00:26:32.599
background color of the selected content
 

00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:35.669
background color of the selected content
and this is entirely declaratively

00:26:35.669 --> 00:26:35.679
and this is entirely declaratively
 

00:26:35.679 --> 00:26:38.139
and this is entirely declaratively
powered by the stateless animator class

00:26:38.139 --> 00:26:38.149
powered by the stateless animator class
 

00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:41.379
powered by the stateless animator class
and so stateless animator is essentially

00:26:41.379 --> 00:26:41.389
and so stateless animator is essentially
 

00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:43.359
and so stateless animator is essentially
selector where within each item tag

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:43.369
selector where within each item tag
 

00:26:43.369 --> 00:26:45.190
selector where within each item tag
within each item which is a given state

00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:45.200
within each item which is a given state
 

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.219
within each item which is a given state
you can define these child animations to

00:26:48.219 --> 00:26:48.229
you can define these child animations to
 

00:26:48.229 --> 00:26:49.839
you can define these child animations to
be run I don't know why it's not an

00:26:49.839 --> 00:26:49.849
be run I don't know why it's not an
 

00:26:49.849 --> 00:26:51.459
be run I don't know why it's not an
animated selector but it's a selector

00:26:51.459 --> 00:26:51.469
animated selector but it's a selector
 

00:26:51.469 --> 00:26:53.859
animated selector but it's a selector
anyway and so here you can see I am

00:26:53.859 --> 00:26:53.869
anyway and so here you can see I am
 

00:26:53.869 --> 00:26:55.449
anyway and so here you can see I am
running an animation over the background

00:26:55.449 --> 00:26:55.459
running an animation over the background
 

00:26:55.459 --> 00:26:57.190
running an animation over the background
color and the translation Z property

00:26:57.190 --> 00:26:57.200
color and the translation Z property
 

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.919
color and the translation Z property
whenever it go into a certain state and

00:26:59.919 --> 00:26:59.929
whenever it go into a certain state and
 

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:01.719
whenever it go into a certain state and
here I would just want to point out you

00:27:01.719 --> 00:27:01.729
here I would just want to point out you
 

00:27:01.729 --> 00:27:03.249
here I would just want to point out you
don't have to create your own view

00:27:03.249 --> 00:27:03.259
don't have to create your own view
 

00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:05.109
don't have to create your own view
States if you don't need them so here we

00:27:05.109 --> 00:27:05.119
States if you don't need them so here we
 

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:07.659
States if you don't need them so here we
just reused the Android activated state

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:07.669
just reused the Android activated state
 

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:09.549
just reused the Android activated state
which is you know available on every

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:09.559
which is you know available on every
 

00:27:09.559 --> 00:27:11.680
which is you know available on every
view so while defining custom view

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:11.690
view so while defining custom view
 

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:13.089
view so while defining custom view
states is super powerful if you have

00:27:13.089 --> 00:27:13.099
states is super powerful if you have
 

00:27:13.099 --> 00:27:14.379
states is super powerful if you have
multiple states you want to move into

00:27:14.379 --> 00:27:14.389
multiple states you want to move into
 

00:27:14.389 --> 00:27:15.459
multiple states you want to move into
and he wants it to be more meaningful

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:15.469
and he wants it to be more meaningful
 

00:27:15.469 --> 00:27:18.099
and he wants it to be more meaningful
and semantic and you can just reuse some

00:27:18.099 --> 00:27:18.109
and semantic and you can just reuse some
 

00:27:18.109 --> 00:27:21.759
and semantic and you can just reuse some
of the Android States and so stateless

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:21.769
of the Android States and so stateless
 

00:27:21.769 --> 00:27:23.619
of the Android States and so stateless
animator how does this kind of like

00:27:23.619 --> 00:27:23.629
animator how does this kind of like
 

00:27:23.629 --> 00:27:26.349
animator how does this kind of like
score on our chart so just like an

00:27:26.349 --> 00:27:26.359
score on our chart so just like an
 

00:27:26.359 --> 00:27:28.029
score on our chart so just like an
animated say so although it's re-entrant

00:27:28.029 --> 00:27:28.039
animated say so although it's re-entrant
 

00:27:28.039 --> 00:27:29.409
animated say so although it's re-entrant
so it will maintain the state so if your

00:27:29.409 --> 00:27:29.419
so it will maintain the state so if your
 

00:27:29.419 --> 00:27:30.909
so it will maintain the state so if your
new state comes in it will cancel

00:27:30.909 --> 00:27:30.919
new state comes in it will cancel
 

00:27:30.919 --> 00:27:32.469
new state comes in it will cancel
anything that was previously running and

00:27:32.469 --> 00:27:32.479
anything that was previously running and
 

00:27:32.479 --> 00:27:34.749
anything that was previously running and
move you into the new state it's kind of

00:27:34.749 --> 00:27:34.759
move you into the new state it's kind of
 

00:27:34.759 --> 00:27:36.519
move you into the new state it's kind of
semi continuous I'll give it like half a

00:27:36.519 --> 00:27:36.529
semi continuous I'll give it like half a
 

00:27:36.529 --> 00:27:38.259
semi continuous I'll give it like half a
mark here and it really comes down to

00:27:38.259 --> 00:27:38.269
mark here and it really comes down to
 

00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:39.399
mark here and it really comes down to
the fact that it's just running these

00:27:39.399 --> 00:27:39.409
the fact that it's just running these
 

00:27:39.409 --> 00:27:41.289
the fact that it's just running these
object animators and just like we looked

00:27:41.289 --> 00:27:41.299
object animators and just like we looked
 

00:27:41.299 --> 00:27:43.779
object animators and just like we looked
at before and you can provide a from

00:27:43.779 --> 00:27:43.789
at before and you can provide a from
 

00:27:43.789 --> 00:27:45.759
at before and you can provide a from
value in a to value so just by admitting

00:27:45.759 --> 00:27:45.769
value in a to value so just by admitting
 

00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:48.819
value in a to value so just by admitting
the from value and it will try and query

00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:48.829
the from value and it will try and query
 

00:27:48.829 --> 00:27:51.519
the from value and it will try and query
the current value in order to run it but

00:27:51.519 --> 00:27:51.529
the current value in order to run it but
 

00:27:51.529 --> 00:27:53.739
the current value in order to run it but
I said try because this is essentially a

00:27:53.739 --> 00:27:53.749
I said try because this is essentially a
 

00:27:53.749 --> 00:27:55.779
I said try because this is essentially a
kind of reflection based approach so

00:27:55.779 --> 00:27:55.789
kind of reflection based approach so
 

00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:59.469
kind of reflection based approach so
view has a get translation Z method on

00:27:59.469 --> 00:27:59.479
view has a get translation Z method on
 

00:27:59.479 --> 00:28:01.539
view has a get translation Z method on
it so it can query the translation Z and

00:28:01.539 --> 00:28:01.549
it so it can query the translation Z and
 

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:03.249
it so it can query the translation Z and
it will then so translation Z will be

00:28:03.249 --> 00:28:03.259
it will then so translation Z will be
 

00:28:03.259 --> 00:28:06.099
it will then so translation Z will be
continuous but there is no get

00:28:06.099 --> 00:28:06.109
continuous but there is no get
 

00:28:06.109 --> 00:28:07.599
continuous but there is no get
background color method on view

00:28:07.599 --> 00:28:07.609
background color method on view
 

00:28:07.609 --> 00:28:09.430
background color method on view
essentially there's a set background

00:28:09.430 --> 00:28:09.440
essentially there's a set background
 

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:11.529
essentially there's a set background
color method which is a convenience

00:28:11.529 --> 00:28:11.539
color method which is a convenience
 

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:13.239
color method which is a convenience
method almost it takes that color and

00:28:13.239 --> 00:28:13.249
method almost it takes that color and
 

00:28:13.249 --> 00:28:15.009
method almost it takes that color and
coerces it into a color drawable and

00:28:15.009 --> 00:28:15.019
coerces it into a color drawable and
 

00:28:15.019 --> 00:28:16.659
coerces it into a color drawable and
sets the color drawer on the view but

00:28:16.659 --> 00:28:16.669
sets the color drawer on the view but
 

00:28:16.669 --> 00:28:19.239
sets the color drawer on the view but
there's no getter for it so you have to

00:28:19.239 --> 00:28:19.249
there's no getter for it so you have to
 

00:28:19.249 --> 00:28:20.829
there's no getter for it so you have to
be a bit careful about if you want to

00:28:20.829 --> 00:28:20.839
be a bit careful about if you want to
 

00:28:20.839 --> 00:28:22.299
be a bit careful about if you want to
make this continuous about using

00:28:22.299 --> 00:28:22.309
make this continuous about using
 

00:28:22.309 --> 00:28:24.729
make this continuous about using
properties which are animatable that you

00:28:24.729 --> 00:28:24.739
properties which are animatable that you
 

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:26.379
properties which are animatable that you
can read their current value in order to

00:28:26.379 --> 00:28:26.389
can read their current value in order to
 

00:28:26.389 --> 00:28:30.609
can read their current value in order to
get this continuous property and the

00:28:30.609 --> 00:28:30.619
get this continuous property and the
 

00:28:30.619 --> 00:28:32.469
get this continuous property and the
last one we talk about is an approach to

00:28:32.469 --> 00:28:32.479
last one we talk about is an approach to
 

00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:35.469
last one we talk about is an approach to
doing custom view animation so let's

00:28:35.469 --> 00:28:35.479
doing custom view animation so let's
 

00:28:35.479 --> 00:28:36.549
doing custom view animation so let's
walk through an example of what I mean

00:28:36.549 --> 00:28:36.559
walk through an example of what I mean
 

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:38.979
walk through an example of what I mean
by that so in the Google i/o application

00:28:38.979 --> 00:28:38.989
by that so in the Google i/o application
 

00:28:38.989 --> 00:28:41.799
by that so in the Google i/o application
again and we have these filter screen

00:28:41.799 --> 00:28:41.809
again and we have these filter screen
 

00:28:41.809 --> 00:28:43.629
again and we have these filter screen
where you can customize the schedule to

00:28:43.629 --> 00:28:43.639
where you can customize the schedule to
 

00:28:43.639 --> 00:28:45.099
where you can customize the schedule to
see the topics that are we interested in

00:28:45.099 --> 00:28:45.109
see the topics that are we interested in
 

00:28:45.109 --> 00:28:46.599
see the topics that are we interested in
you're just interested in Android and

00:28:46.599 --> 00:28:46.609
you're just interested in Android and
 

00:28:46.609 --> 00:28:49.930
you're just interested in Android and
sessions right and so this is a custom

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:49.940
sessions right and so this is a custom
 

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:50.960
sessions right and so this is a custom
view

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:50.970
view
 

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.700
view
because we want to have complete control

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:52.710
because we want to have complete control
 

00:28:52.710 --> 00:28:54.410
because we want to have complete control
over the rendering of it and there's a

00:28:54.410 --> 00:28:54.420
over the rendering of it and there's a
 

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.960
over the rendering of it and there's a
few games going on with this animation

00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:55.970
few games going on with this animation
 

00:28:55.970 --> 00:28:59.720
few games going on with this animation
so when you select it there's the kind

00:28:59.720 --> 00:28:59.730
so when you select it there's the kind
 

00:28:59.730 --> 00:29:01.880
so when you select it there's the kind
of the colored circle both increases in

00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:01.890
of the colored circle both increases in
 

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.830
of the colored circle both increases in
size as well as we animate its center to

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840
size as well as we animate its center to
 

00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.500
size as well as we animate its center to
be in the center of the chip we animate

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:06.510
be in the center of the chip we animate
 

00:29:06.510 --> 00:29:08.840
be in the center of the chip we animate
the text position and then we also scale

00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:08.850
the text position and then we also scale
 

00:29:08.850 --> 00:29:10.610
the text position and then we also scale
up the draw ball which is that clear X

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:10.620
up the draw ball which is that clear X
 

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.330
up the draw ball which is that clear X
other side so you could think of a way

00:29:14.330 --> 00:29:14.340
other side so you could think of a way
 

00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.740
other side so you could think of a way
of writing this as a custom animation

00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:15.750
of writing this as a custom animation
 

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:17.930
of writing this as a custom animation
whereby you create animators for each of

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940
whereby you create animators for each of
 

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.730
whereby you create animators for each of
those things which is changing when you

00:29:19.730 --> 00:29:19.740
those things which is changing when you
 

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:21.620
those things which is changing when you
run those animations individually so an

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:21.630
run those animations individually so an
 

00:29:21.630 --> 00:29:23.930
run those animations individually so an
animation for the circle radius one for

00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:23.940
animation for the circle radius one for
 

00:29:23.940 --> 00:29:26.420
animation for the circle radius one for
the circle center and then you could

00:29:26.420 --> 00:29:26.430
the circle center and then you could
 

00:29:26.430 --> 00:29:27.830
the circle center and then you could
perhaps put them into an animator set

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840
perhaps put them into an animator set
 

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:29.360
perhaps put them into an animator set
and try and control them and orchestrate

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:29.370
and try and control them and orchestrate
 

00:29:29.370 --> 00:29:32.240
and try and control them and orchestrate
them my lap but instead the way we went

00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:32.250
them my lap but instead the way we went
 

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:34.520
them my lap but instead the way we went
for this is we instead have a single and

00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:34.530
for this is we instead have a single and
 

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.740
for this is we instead have a single and
progress property which is just a float

00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:36.750
progress property which is just a float
 

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.180
progress property which is just a float
which runs from 0 to 1 and we just run a

00:29:41.180 --> 00:29:41.190
which runs from 0 to 1 and we just run a
 

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:43.010
which runs from 0 to 1 and we just run a
single animation over that progress

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:43.020
single animation over that progress
 

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:46.040
single animation over that progress
property and then what we do is we drive

00:29:46.040 --> 00:29:46.050
property and then what we do is we drive
 

00:29:46.050 --> 00:29:47.810
property and then what we do is we drive
the rendering to query that progress

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820
the rendering to query that progress
 

00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.730
the rendering to query that progress
property so for the circle radius for

00:29:49.730 --> 00:29:49.740
property so for the circle radius for
 

00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.130
property so for the circle radius for
example we say what radius should I be

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:52.140
example we say what radius should I be
 

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.870
example we say what radius should I be
were from between this start value and

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:53.880
were from between this start value and
 

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.700
were from between this start value and
that end value for a given progress and

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:55.710
that end value for a given progress and
 

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:56.960
that end value for a given progress and
if you haven't seen the loop function

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:56.970
if you haven't seen the loop function
 

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.790
if you haven't seen the loop function
before is a very common animation kind

00:29:58.790 --> 00:29:58.800
before is a very common animation kind
 

00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.260
before is a very common animation kind
of utility which means linearly

00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:00.270
of utility which means linearly
 

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:01.820

interpolate which will do just that

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:01.830
interpolate which will do just that
 

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:03.920
interpolate which will do just that
so between this value and this value for

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:03.930
so between this value and this value for
 

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.030
so between this value and this value for
a given progress what should I be and

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:07.040
a given progress what should I be and
 

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:10.700
a given progress what should I be and
the key takeaway here is that if you

00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:10.710
the key takeaway here is that if you
 

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:13.400
the key takeaway here is that if you
have this single progress function and

00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:13.410
have this single progress function and
 

00:30:13.410 --> 00:30:15.650
have this single progress function and
then you can just animate it very easily

00:30:15.650 --> 00:30:15.660
then you can just animate it very easily
 

00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:17.750
then you can just animate it very easily
so you can hook this up to a spring like

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760
so you can hook this up to a spring like
 

00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.250
so you can hook this up to a spring like
we looked at before and have this

00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260
we looked at before and have this
 

00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.620
we looked at before and have this
entirely be continuous and smooth by

00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:21.630
entirely be continuous and smooth by
 

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:23.780
entirely be continuous and smooth by
running spring animations and be able to

retarget it to something else rather

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:25.560
retarget it to something else rather
 

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:26.750
retarget it to something else rather
than having to try and orchestrate

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760

multiple and animate assets which can be
 

00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.490

a pain or you could hook this up to a

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:31.500
a pain or you could hook this up to a
 

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.860
a pain or you could hook this up to a
gesture perhaps and do something

00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:33.870

essentially you can figure that as Kroft

00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:57.750
essentially you can figure that as Kroft
 

00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.270

recalled then you're going to end up in
the incorrect state so this is like

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:14.130
the incorrect state so this is like
 

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:15.799
the incorrect state so this is like
table stakes you have to get this right

00:31:15.799 --> 00:31:15.809
table stakes you have to get this right
 

00:31:15.809 --> 00:31:17.690
table stakes you have to get this right
in order for animations to survive in

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:17.700
in order for animations to survive in
 

00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:20.779
in order for animations to survive in
this reactive well continuous is all

00:31:20.779 --> 00:31:20.789
this reactive well continuous is all
 

00:31:20.789 --> 00:31:22.279
this reactive well continuous is all
about I think having a smoother user

00:31:22.279 --> 00:31:22.289
about I think having a smoother user
 

00:31:22.289 --> 00:31:24.200
about I think having a smoother user
experience so valleys don't jump

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:24.210
experience so valleys don't jump
 

00:31:24.210 --> 00:31:25.909
experience so valleys don't jump
unexpectedly which can be very jarring

00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919
unexpectedly which can be very jarring
 

00:31:25.919 --> 00:31:28.159
unexpectedly which can be very jarring
and smoothness is almost like this

00:31:28.159 --> 00:31:28.169
and smoothness is almost like this
 

00:31:28.169 --> 00:31:30.470
and smoothness is almost like this
stretch goal for me it's like you know

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480

just having things abruptly change

just having things abruptly change
 

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:36.590
just having things abruptly change
velocity and change direction then there

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600
velocity and change direction then there
 

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.029

could be a much nicer experience to have

00:31:38.029 --> 00:31:38.039
could be a much nicer experience to have
 

00:31:38.039 --> 00:31:40.130
could be a much nicer experience to have
it to it in a smooth manner but I think

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:40.140
it to it in a smooth manner but I think
 

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:42.019
it to it in a smooth manner but I think
it's worth striving for because what's

00:31:42.019 --> 00:31:42.029
it's worth striving for because what's
 

00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:43.310
it's worth striving for because what's
the point in animating it if you're just

00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320
the point in animating it if you're just
 

00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:48.560
the point in animating it if you're just
going to kind of half-ass it and so yeah

00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:48.570
going to kind of half-ass it and so yeah
 

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.850
going to kind of half-ass it and so yeah
so that's my cake that's my conclusion

00:31:49.850 --> 00:31:49.860
so that's my cake that's my conclusion
 

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:53.510
so that's my cake that's my conclusion
really like the I think it'll be a shame

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:53.520
really like the I think it'll be a shame
 

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:55.250
really like the I think it'll be a shame
if we in this reactive world if we were

if we in this reactive world if we were
 

00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.110
if we in this reactive world if we were
just to give up on animations and I

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120
just to give up on animations and I
 

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.490
just to give up on animations and I
think that these principles can really

00:31:58.490 --> 00:31:58.500
think that these principles can really
 

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.740
think that these principles can really
help you hold them in mind in making

help you hold them in mind in making
 

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:03.240
help you hold them in mind in making
better animated apps thanks very much
