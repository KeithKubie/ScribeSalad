00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Here in Eastern Pennsylvania is a fire that has been burning for 53 years

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.542
to the day

00:00:05.542 --> 00:00:09.083
It’s gonna be burning for another 250 more

00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:18.917
It started simply in 1962 with a dump fire on Memorial Day

00:00:18.917 --> 00:00:21.083
it happened all the time, they usually just burned themselves out

00:00:21.083 --> 00:00:23.041
but this particular dump fire spread

00:00:23.041 --> 00:00:26.333
and it spread to an open coal vein

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.000
this fire would start a slow motion disaster

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.125
that would consume and destroy the town of Centralia

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:34.333
over the next 50 years

00:00:37.083 --> 00:00:41.083
So Centralia sits on a huge vein of anthracite coal

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.792
and was founded in the mid 1800s

00:00:43.792 --> 00:00:46.208
with the specific purpose of coal mining

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.166
...today....

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:02.792
for the first twenty years the fire went largely unaddressed

00:01:02.792 --> 00:01:04.750
people didn’t necessarily consider it an emergency

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.208
in 1981 everything changed

00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:10.083
Valentines Day 1981

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:14.041
Twelve year old Todd Domboski was playing in his grandmothers backyard

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:17.000
when the earth opened up below his feet

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.500
“I’d seen smoke and I thought, I didn’t want her, my Grandmother to go over near it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.041
because she’s elderly, and I was worried about her

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.917
so I went over to see if it was the mine fire

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:28.500
and when I did I just fell right through

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.667
luckily his cousin was there, grabbed him and pulled him out

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:36.208
before he fell into what turned out to be the 150 foot hole that had been created

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:39.250
Centralia went from being an anonymous town with

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:40.959
a little coal fire problem

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.250
to being a huge national concern

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.792
The question was, what were they going to do about this town

00:01:46.792 --> 00:01:48.875
that was on fire 

00:01:48.875 --> 00:01:51.000
 It divided the town in half. Half the people wanted to stay

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.041
they wanted to  make it a better place to live, they said it was safe

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.458
the other half were basically looking for federal funds to leave

00:01:56.458 --> 00:01:58.000
they said “we don’t want to be here”

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.750
it got really ugly and finally it ended in a vote

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.333
and more than half the town voted to leave

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:07.041
and that was the moment that Centralia truly began unraveling

00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:11.041
So in 1984 most of the residents were bought out

00:02:11.041 --> 00:02:12.792
and given funds to leave Centralia

00:02:12.792 --> 00:02:17.583
In 1992 the town was officially claimed using eminent domain

00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:23.333
In 2002 the Postal Service officially revoked the zip code for Centralia

00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:31.041
Finally in 2009 the Governor of Pennsylvania began enforcing the eminent domain

00:02:31.041 --> 00:02:34.166
trying to make the last few residents, which at this point was down to eleven

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:35.625
leave the town.

00:02:35.625 --> 00:02:39.208
But the residents that were still here, didn’t want to go

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:42.125
Their argument was that the coal fire had actually moved

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:44.125
It was headed towards other towns now

00:02:44.125 --> 00:02:47.458
and that Centralia’s air quality was back to as good as

00:02:47.458 --> 00:02:50.959
or better than it was before the coal fire started

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.458
They were allowed to stay. As of 2013 they were given permission to live out their lives here

00:02:56.458 --> 00:03:00.000
But when the last 10 resident of Centralia die

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.208
the town, officially will cease to exist

00:03:06.375 --> 00:03:09.041
Centralia is certainly the most famous example of a coal mine fire

00:03:09.041 --> 00:03:14.458
But it’s actually one of 38 active coal mine fires in the state of Pennsylvania

00:03:14.458 --> 00:03:17.041
one of hundreds in the US

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:23.333
If you get into India or China we are talking about thousands and thousands of active coal mine fires

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:29.041
and in fact the collective output of carbon monoxide of coal mine fires

00:03:29.041 --> 00:03:32.917
may account for as much as one percent of global warming

00:03:32.917 --> 00:03:37.583
Much like Chernobyl, Centralia has enough kind of “ruin capital”

00:03:37.583 --> 00:03:41.333
It’s a go to I think as a kind of pop cultural reference for

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:43.542
abandoned, disaster.

00:03:43.542 --> 00:03:45.917
This is sort of a town gone wrong

00:03:45.917 --> 00:03:49.917
the thing that looks the most like a ruin is this abandoned turnpike

00:03:49.917 --> 00:03:53.041
there’s not much left, the buildings are basically gone

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:54.959
it looks like a bunch of overgrown lots

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.583
slowly turning back into forest

00:03:57.583 --> 00:04:00.166
And one day that, you know thats what it will be

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:05.333
It will be some streets through a forest, and no one will think twice about what was here once before
