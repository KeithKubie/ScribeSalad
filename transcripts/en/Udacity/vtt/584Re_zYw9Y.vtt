00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.670
Because the effect of warfarin is to ultimately

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.680
decrease the amount of available vitamin K, which

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.970
can in turn regulate blood clotting. The amount

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.920
of vitamin K available from the environment can also

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.840
influence the efficacy of warfarin. So we just

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.160
talked about how changing the VKORC1 levels can affect

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.620
the efficacy of warfarin. But VKORC1 is acting

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.960
to regulate the amount of reduced vitamin K around.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.055
So we can supplant the actions of

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:32.200
VKORC1to a certain extent by supplying vitamin k

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.960
in our diet. Leafy green vegetables have high

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.740
vitamin K, and so do other foods. You

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.530
can also take vitamin supplements, or find vitamin K in other sources. So if you

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.020
changed your diet to be high in vitamin K, would the same dose as warfarin be

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.390
more effective or less effective?
