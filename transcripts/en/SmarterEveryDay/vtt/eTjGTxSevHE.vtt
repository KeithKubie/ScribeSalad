Hey it's me Destin. Welcome to Smarter Every Day. So you know you're in trouble

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:08.500
when you have to break out the tinker toys to explain 
a concept. What are you gonna build?

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.680
(son) Tinker toy ducks, scrod and rolls over your ham. [??]

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.870
Good idea. What are you gonna do?
(Daughter) The sunset.
The sunset.

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.050
OK. So we're gonna start building.
Go.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.320
Alright here at Smarter Every Day we're right in the 
middle of a series on how helicopters work, and if you

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.400
recall, I told you at the beginning that 
helicopters are very very complicated.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.600
So here's the tinker toy helicopter that I just made, 
and if you recall from the other videos,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.770
I told you that as the blades on the 
helicopter spin around

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.950
they have the ability to change pitch as they go around

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.140
in the rotor disc. Now this is called 
cyclic pitch, and if you don't

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.330
understand this concept you need to go watch this 
remedial video so you can remind yourself

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.510
about what I'm talking about. So let's assume that 
we fully understand how that works.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
Here's the question. 
If I have a helicopter and I

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.850
simply want to make a manouver and I want to tilt 
the helicopter up and forward just like

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.030
this, how do we change the pitch in the rotor disc. So

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.210
to me it's logical that I would want to increase 
the lift on the back of the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.260
rotor disc, so what that would do is that 
would cause more lift here which would

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.320
cause it to tilt forward. This makes sense to me. 
Does it make sense to you?

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.400
Well here's the deal. You're absolutely 
wrong if it does. This is

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
why. You actually provide more lift on the side

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.770
of the helicopter and that will 
tilt the helicopter forward.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.880
When I first figured this out, it blew my mind 
because it just did not make

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.060
intuitive sense, but it has something to do 
with this little gadget right here.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.250
You may have seen one before. 
It's called a gyroscope.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.420
So what does this have to do with helicopters. 
If you think about it,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.610
it's a big mass spinning very fast. Look at

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.730
a helicopter. What do we have on top? 
It's a big mass,

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.900
spinning very fast.
So when the rotors are aligned with the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.090
helicopter body, if I wanted to pitch the helicopter body

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.300
forward like so, I would expect us to

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.390
be in phase right here, and I would expect to take less of a bite with this rotor and and more of a

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.510
bite with this rotor to rock it over is that what?..
(Carl) That's not the case.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.700
It does seem like that would be, but due to gyroscopic

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
precession, any force on a spinning disc, which these blades

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.060
do act as a disc, takes effect over a 90 degree

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.240
phase. So if we give it a force here, to push down

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.310
or up to roll the helicopter forward, it'll actually take effect 90 degrees

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.500
later, and roll the helicoper sideways. So in order to roll it forward

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.670
we give the pitch when it's 90 degrees away

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.850
from ..
(Destin) Oh, so it's like.. It's almost like predicting the future

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.040
or something like that.
(Carl) Something like that.
(Destin) So, if I wanted to rock the helicopter

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.220
forward, I would take less of a bite when I'm 90 degrees out of phase

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.410
and more of a bite over there, and that would do it?
(Carl) Yep, so the

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.610
blade here pulls up. This one pushes down, and it takes effect 90 degrees

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:15.800
later when it's parallel with the machine, and the machine will rock, like so.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.990
Yeah. I'm not getting it either.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.170
In fact, I got a one-on-one explanation from an ex-pilot at the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:28.350
Smithsonian and I still didn't get it.
To control to

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.540
90 degrees in front, on the swashplate.
(Destin) Like everything on

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.730
Smarter Every Day, I finally understood this when I made an experiment for myself.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.910
Alright so Carl and I have setup a really super high tech experiment involving

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.090
bicycle wheels. Hey the Wright brothers did it. It's good enough for me if it's good enough for them.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.220
And we have a camera aligned along a force

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.330
application device, which is a metal strip,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.410
and do you want to explain what we've got going on here?
(Carl) Alright, we're going to
(Destin) Wait!

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.580
I'm better, go ahead.
(Carl) We're going

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.760
to apply a force, straight up, and as you can see here

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.960
the tyre rotates in the same plane as we're moving this bar.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.140
But, when it's spinning, it's going to be different.
(Destin) Let's..Let's just check it out.

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.330
Here we go. I used to play with my mom's exercise

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.500
machine when I was like 5, so I'm highly qualified to apply angular momentum

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.590
here.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.870
Angular momentum applied! Hit the brakes.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.050
(Carl) Trying to control this thing.
(Destin)Alright.
(Carl) So now we're

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.220
gonna do the same test again. We're gonna apply force straight up, here.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.400
And.. it rotates, 90 degrees from where we apply the force.

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.480
(Destin) Alright this principle is called gyros.. [cough] gyroscopic

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.580
precession, and that's basically the forces applied

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.720
orthogonal to the plane of rotation, it acts 90 degrees out of phase to that

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.880
applied force. I think it's pretty interesting. So, I have a plane of rotation

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:04.080
here of the force, but it actually acts in this plane.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:08.250
And so if you look at the horizon that the camera is looking at as he pushes up, it rotates

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:12.440
opposite of that. It's pretty cool! Anyway

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:16.640
that's it. That's why helicopter blades operate 90 degrees out of phase.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.810
Anything you want to add? Besides the fact that I was kneeling in a horse biscuit

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.000
the entire time?
Hey horse. What do you know about

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.170
gyroscopic precession? [silence]
It's what I thought. [laugh]

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.350
So I realise this was one of the more complicated videos and I hope you got it. If you would, leave me some

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.540
comments and let me know, so I can figure out how to best explain things in the future.

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.720
Also, if you're interested, subscribe because next week we're gonna talk about the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.860
helicopter speed limit, and it's not because of the FAA. It's physics.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.030
