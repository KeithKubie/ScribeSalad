response and that's why I was sort of

00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:21.210
response and that's why I was sort of

getting a little bit nervy there at one
 

00:34:24.599 --> 00:34:26.119
getting a little bit nervy there at one
point because one of the vehicles is

00:34:26.119 --> 00:34:26.129
point because one of the vehicles is
 

00:34:26.129 --> 00:34:27.980
point because one of the vehicles is
trapped not trapped down there but one

of the vehicles is down there and it's
 

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:34.309
of the vehicles is down there and it's
obviously he's now come down out of the

obviously he's now come down out of the
 

00:34:34.319 --> 00:34:35.899
obviously he's now come down out of the
drainage line he wasn't in the water

00:34:35.899 --> 00:34:35.909
drainage line he wasn't in the water
 

00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:37.849
drainage line he wasn't in the water
when the vehicle made its way down there

00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859
when the vehicle made its way down there
 

00:34:37.859 --> 00:34:39.829
when the vehicle made its way down there
but he's now popped out of the bushes

trying to suggest we might need to
shuffle around so it's not us that he's

00:34:53.059 --> 00:34:53.069
shuffle around so it's not us that he's
 

00:34:53.069 --> 00:34:54.919

Lions evolved well interestingly we've

01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:12.550
Lions evolved well interestingly we've
 

01:01:12.550 --> 01:01:14.370
Lions evolved well interestingly we've
always kind of assumed that they and

01:01:14.370 --> 01:01:14.380
always kind of assumed that they and
 

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.670
always kind of assumed that they and
they evolved in Africa and that would be

01:01:17.670 --> 01:01:17.680
they evolved in Africa and that would be
 

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.140
they evolved in Africa and that would be
a pretty safe assumption considering how

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:19.150
a pretty safe assumption considering how
 

01:01:19.150 --> 01:01:21.359
a pretty safe assumption considering how
well adapted they are and how they've

01:01:21.359 --> 01:01:21.369
well adapted they are and how they've
 

01:01:21.369 --> 01:01:24.240
well adapted they are and how they've
kind of taken over in terms of being the

01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:24.250
kind of taken over in terms of being the
 

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:26.880
kind of taken over in terms of being the
top predator one off the top predators

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:26.890
top predator one off the top predators
 

01:01:26.890 --> 01:01:29.970

but the recent work I was telling you

01:01:29.970 --> 01:01:29.980
but the recent work I was telling you
 

01:01:29.980 --> 01:01:31.829
but the recent work I was telling you
about where in the Himalayas they found

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839
about where in the Himalayas they found
 

01:01:31.839 --> 01:01:36.480

this Panthera blight da is actually

this Panthera blight da is actually
 

01:01:36.490 --> 01:01:39.270
this Panthera blight da is actually
pointing to central central northern

01:01:39.270 --> 01:01:39.280

so it's quite different to what we first

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:44.890
so it's quite different to what we first
 

01:01:44.890 --> 01:01:49.020
so it's quite different to what we first
expected but in that area apparently

01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:49.030
expected but in that area apparently
 

01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:52.440

their lineage or at least we have

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:52.450
their lineage or at least we have
 

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:54.990
their lineage or at least we have
evidence for their lineage at about ten

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:55.000
evidence for their lineage at about ten
 

01:01:55.000 --> 01:02:00.420
evidence for their lineage at about ten
point seven million years so it's quite

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:00.430
point seven million years so it's quite
 

01:02:00.430 --> 01:02:03.390
point seven million years so it's quite
interesting to see how they have

01:02:03.390 --> 01:02:03.400
interesting to see how they have
 

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.329
interesting to see how they have
primarily kind of stuck around in Africa

01:02:06.329 --> 01:02:06.339
primarily kind of stuck around in Africa
 

01:02:06.339 --> 01:02:09.569
primarily kind of stuck around in Africa
or they have been very very successful

01:02:09.569 --> 01:02:09.579
or they have been very very successful
 

01:02:09.579 --> 01:02:16.559
or they have been very very successful
in Africa I always find it very

01:02:16.559 --> 01:02:16.569
in Africa I always find it very
 

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:18.059
in Africa I always find it very
interesting to think about how these

01:02:18.059 --> 01:02:18.069
interesting to think about how these
 

01:02:18.069 --> 01:02:20.250
interesting to think about how these
animals came about and why they are the

01:02:20.250 --> 01:02:20.260
animals came about and why they are the
 

01:02:20.260 --> 01:02:22.920
animals came about and why they are the
way they are and so much of it has to do

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:22.930
way they are and so much of it has to do
 

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:24.420
way they are and so much of it has to do
with the ecology it's not just the

with the ecology it's not just the
 

01:02:24.430 --> 01:02:26.339
with the ecology it's not just the

animal it's about the environment and
 

01:02:26.349 --> 01:02:29.640
animal it's about the environment and
all of that as well anyway I did tell

and then David threw himself around on
 

01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:20.109
and then David threw himself around on
the back of the car and the squirrel ran

I really hope that they'll get up a
 

01:09:01.409 --> 01:09:07.160
I really hope that they'll get up a
little bit earlier on the hunt because

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:07.170
little bit earlier on the hunt because
 

01:09:07.170 --> 01:09:10.069
little bit earlier on the hunt because
of course of the temperature and the

01:09:10.069 --> 01:09:10.079
of course of the temperature and the
 

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.660
of course of the temperature and the
length of the days now the darkness

01:09:11.660 --> 01:09:11.670
length of the days now the darkness
 

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:22.970
length of the days now the darkness
that's coming in slightly earlier so

01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980
that's coming in slightly earlier so
 

01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:27.769

by me using cute to describe them but I

01:09:29.779 --> 01:09:29.789
by me using cute to describe them but I
 

01:09:29.789 --> 01:09:35.950
by me using cute to describe them but I
do think that they are now talking about

01:09:35.950 --> 01:09:35.960
do think that they are now talking about
 

01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:39.559
do think that they are now talking about
hunting and them being waiting for it to

01:09:39.559 --> 01:09:39.569
hunting and them being waiting for it to
 

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:41.269
hunting and them being waiting for it to
cool down before they actually get on

01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279
cool down before they actually get on
 

01:09:41.279 --> 01:09:44.269
cool down before they actually get on
the hunt it's actually quite relevant

01:09:44.269 --> 01:09:44.279
the hunt it's actually quite relevant
 

01:09:44.279 --> 01:09:47.599
the hunt it's actually quite relevant
for something else and that is climate

01:09:47.599 --> 01:09:47.609
for something else and that is climate
 

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:50.989
for something else and that is climate
change and the rising daytime

01:09:50.989 --> 01:09:50.999
change and the rising daytime
 

01:09:50.999 --> 01:09:54.289
change and the rising daytime
temperatures now we may not think that

01:09:54.289 --> 01:09:54.299
temperatures now we may not think that
 

01:09:54.299 --> 01:09:56.870
temperatures now we may not think that
it could affect predators in this kind

01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880
it could affect predators in this kind
 

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:01.040
it could affect predators in this kind
of way but we know that Predators don't

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:01.050
of way but we know that Predators don't
 

01:10:01.050 --> 01:10:03.379
of way but we know that Predators don't
do well in the heat and we know that

01:10:03.379 --> 01:10:03.389
do well in the heat and we know that
 

01:10:03.389 --> 01:10:08.089
do well in the heat and we know that
they can overeat overheat easily and if

01:10:08.089 --> 01:10:08.099
they can overeat overheat easily and if
 

01:10:08.099 --> 01:10:11.390
they can overeat overheat easily and if
it is hotter in the days in during the

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400
it is hotter in the days in during the
 

01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:13.100
it is hotter in the days in during the
day then the time that they can actually

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:13.110
day then the time that they can actually
 

01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:17.930
day then the time that they can actually
invest in possibly what they would have

01:10:17.930 --> 01:10:17.940
invest in possibly what they would have
 

01:10:17.940 --> 01:10:21.319
invest in possibly what they would have
hunted even if it was towards the end of

01:10:21.319 --> 01:10:21.329
hunted even if it was towards the end of
 

01:10:21.329 --> 01:10:25.759
hunted even if it was towards the end of
the day or just when the Sun is I'll be

01:10:25.759 --> 01:10:25.769
the day or just when the Sun is I'll be
 

01:10:25.769 --> 01:10:27.049
the day or just when the Sun is I'll be
affected maybe even those times when

01:10:27.049 --> 01:10:27.059
affected maybe even those times when
 

01:10:27.059 --> 01:10:31.790
affected maybe even those times when
they may be active are no longer good

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800
they may be active are no longer good
 

01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:34.819
they may be active are no longer good
enough for them because it's too hot so

01:10:34.819 --> 01:10:34.829
enough for them because it's too hot so
 

01:10:34.829 --> 01:10:36.560
enough for them because it's too hot so
that's actually an implication of global

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:36.570
that's actually an implication of global
 

01:10:36.570 --> 01:10:38.750
that's actually an implication of global
warming that we don't often think of and

01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760
warming that we don't often think of and
 

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.279
warming that we don't often think of and
especially for wild dogs this can be

01:10:40.279 --> 01:10:40.289
especially for wild dogs this can be
 

01:10:40.289 --> 01:10:42.410
especially for wild dogs this can be
very true because they will hunt in the

01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420
very true because they will hunt in the
 

01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.779
very true because they will hunt in the
day and when they do that that time that

01:10:44.779 --> 01:10:44.789
day and when they do that that time that
 

01:10:44.789 --> 01:10:45.080
day and when they do that that time that
they can

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:45.090
they can
 

01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:48.110
they can
in hunting is really really shortened

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:48.120
in hunting is really really shortened
 

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:50.420
in hunting is really really shortened
not only is it shortened the intensity

01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:50.430
not only is it shortened the intensity
 

01:10:50.430 --> 01:10:52.490
not only is it shortened the intensity
of the heat while they are on the hunt

01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:52.500
of the heat while they are on the hunt
 

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500
of the heat while they are on the hunt
for those few parts of the day when it

01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:54.510
for those few parts of the day when it
 

01:10:54.510 --> 01:10:56.390
for those few parts of the day when it
is cool enough it's still going to be

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:56.400
is cool enough it's still going to be
 

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.010
is cool enough it's still going to be
higher than they would normally be

01:10:58.010 --> 01:10:58.020
higher than they would normally be
 

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.990
higher than they would normally be
exposed to so there's also those type of

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000
exposed to so there's also those type of
 

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.330
exposed to so there's also those type of
things to think about and especially

01:11:02.330 --> 01:11:02.340
things to think about and especially
 

01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:04.850
things to think about and especially
when it comes to male lions and of

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860
when it comes to male lions and of
 

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.200
when it comes to male lions and of
course the mane and the testosterone

01:11:06.200 --> 01:11:06.210
course the mane and the testosterone
 

01:11:06.210 --> 01:11:10.000
course the mane and the testosterone
that evolved in the growth of the mane

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:10.010
that evolved in the growth of the mane
 

01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:13.190
that evolved in the growth of the mane
has a lot to do or apparently has a lot

01:11:13.190 --> 01:11:13.200
has a lot to do or apparently has a lot
 

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.950
has a lot to do or apparently has a lot
to do with temperature and climate so if

01:11:15.950 --> 01:11:15.960
to do with temperature and climate so if
 

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:18.290

the lion was in an area where it was
 

01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.390
the lion was in an area where it was
particularly hot then that can actually

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400
particularly hot then that can actually
 

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.960
particularly hot then that can actually
influence how and it grows its vein or

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:23.970
influence how and it grows its vein or
 

01:11:23.970 --> 01:11:25.400
influence how and it grows its vein or
the darkness which it grows its Mane and

01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:25.410
the darkness which it grows its Mane and
 

01:11:25.410 --> 01:11:26.840
the darkness which it grows its Mane and
the length to which it's grown it grows

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:26.850
the length to which it's grown it grows
 

01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:29.000
the length to which it's grown it grows
its Mane but apparently the length at

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:29.010
its Mane but apparently the length at
 

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:32.180

01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.110
and then they form a coalition in the
years to come sometimes I can take them

01:32:44.110 --> 01:32:44.120
years to come sometimes I can take them
 

01:32:44.120 --> 01:32:46.330
years to come sometimes I can take them
a bit of time but eventually most of

01:32:46.330 --> 01:32:46.340
a bit of time but eventually most of
 

01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:49.570
a bit of time but eventually most of
them do although you do get some nomadic

01:32:49.570 --> 01:32:49.580
them do although you do get some nomadic
 

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:53.440
them do although you do get some nomadic
males and if pride is the group of

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:53.450
males and if pride is the group of
 

01:32:53.450 --> 01:32:56.320
males and if pride is the group of
females and their offspring and a pride

01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:56.330
females and their offspring and a pride
 

01:32:56.330 --> 01:33:01.060
females and their offspring and a pride
would sort of belong to a coalition so

01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:01.070
would sort of belong to a coalition so
 

01:33:01.070 --> 01:33:03.580
would sort of belong to a coalition so
the vocals won't make or create their

the vocals won't make or create their
 

01:33:03.590 --> 01:33:06.010
the vocals won't make or create their

family of lions that we have here
 

01:33:12.050 --> 01:33:14.950
family of lions that we have here
and they form a coalition that is males

01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960
and they form a coalition that is males
 

01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.630
and they form a coalition that is males
that are working together and of course

01:33:16.630 --> 01:33:16.640
that are working together and of course
 

01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:19.000
that are working together and of course
the females the pride they always come

the females the pride they always come
 

01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:20.380
the females the pride they always come
together and they'll see each other very

01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:20.390
together and they'll see each other very
 

01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:22.450
together and they'll see each other very
often but the males will leave for a

01:33:22.450 --> 01:33:22.460
often but the males will leave for a
 

01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:25.510
often but the males will leave for a
long time sometimes weeks and that I

01:33:25.510 --> 01:33:25.520
long time sometimes weeks and that I

territory that a male coalition occupies
 

01:33:33.740 --> 01:33:37.360
territory that a male coalition occupies
can overlap quite a few prides so that a

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:37.370
can overlap quite a few prides so that a
 

01:33:37.370 --> 01:33:39.910
can overlap quite a few prides so that a
few prides can belong to a lion and that

01:33:39.910 --> 01:33:39.920
few prides can belong to a lion and that
 

01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.710
few prides can belong to a lion and that
is of course an area where the lions are

01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:41.720
is of course an area where the lions are
 

01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:44.710
is of course an area where the lions are
ready at a high density but in an area

know where the third Avoca is but in my
 

01:34:45.710 --> 01:34:48.460
know where the third Avoca is but in my
experience with them I have noticed that

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:48.470
experience with them I have noticed that
 

01:34:48.470 --> 01:34:49.960
experience with them I have noticed that
when two of them are kind of down this

when two of them are kind of down this
 

01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:52.600
when two of them are kind of down this

hangs around a bit a bit more to the
 

01:34:55.130 --> 01:34:58.180
hangs around a bit a bit more to the
north now that's just something I've

01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:58.190
north now that's just something I've
 

01:34:58.190 --> 01:34:59.980
north now that's just something I've
observed I don't know if that's where he

01:34:59.980 --> 01:34:59.990
observed I don't know if that's where he
 

01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:02.220
observed I don't know if that's where he
is right now

01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:02.230
is right now
 

01:35:02.230 --> 01:35:05.680
is right now
but in my past experience that is what

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:05.690
but in my past experience that is what
 

01:35:05.690 --> 01:35:11.880
but in my past experience that is what
I've seen

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:11.890
 
 

01:35:11.890 --> 01:35:14.590
 
now I said I was waiting for this I was

01:35:14.590 --> 01:35:14.600
now I said I was waiting for this I was
 

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:19.330
now I said I was waiting for this I was
waiting for the snow awakening of the

01:35:19.330 --> 01:35:19.340
waiting for the snow awakening of the
 

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.890
waiting for the snow awakening of the
lines which is what happens around this

01:35:20.890 --> 01:35:20.900
lines which is what happens around this
 

01:35:20.900 --> 01:35:25.420
lines which is what happens around this
time when the Sun is setting and it

01:35:25.420 --> 01:35:25.430
time when the Sun is setting and it
 

01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:27.220
time when the Sun is setting and it
starts with a few movements some

01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:27.230
starts with a few movements some
 

01:35:27.230 --> 01:35:30.010
starts with a few movements some
stretching some yawning then there's of

01:35:30.010 --> 01:35:30.020
stretching some yawning then there's of
 

01:35:30.020 --> 01:35:33.130
stretching some yawning then there's of
course the defecating that goes on they

01:35:33.130 --> 01:35:33.140
course the defecating that goes on they
 

01:35:33.140 --> 01:35:35.650
course the defecating that goes on they
relieve themselves and then they are on

01:35:35.650 --> 01:35:35.660
relieve themselves and then they are on
 

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:36.310
relieve themselves and then they are on
the move

01:35:36.310 --> 01:35:36.320
the move
 

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.470
the move
so this is a good sign that he's turned

01:35:38.470 --> 01:35:38.480
so this is a good sign that he's turned
 

01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:46.690
so this is a good sign that he's turned
over goat face he would like to know how

01:35:46.690 --> 01:35:46.700
over goat face he would like to know how
 

01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:49.690
over goat face he would like to know how
old the Evoque Emile's asked while they

01:35:49.690 --> 01:35:49.700
old the Evoque Emile's asked while they
 

01:35:49.700 --> 01:35:53.080
old the Evoque Emile's asked while they
were born in 2013 so I don't know

01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:53.090
were born in 2013 so I don't know
 

01:35:53.090 --> 01:35:55.060
were born in 2013 so I don't know
exactly which month that they were born

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:55.070
exactly which month that they were born
 

01:35:55.070 --> 01:35:56.620
exactly which month that they were born
it's a sort of hard especially if you

01:35:56.620 --> 01:35:56.630
it's a sort of hard especially if you
 

01:35:56.630 --> 01:35:59.320
it's a sort of hard especially if you
haven't followed them from Cubs but I'm

01:35:59.320 --> 01:35:59.330
haven't followed them from Cubs but I'm
 

01:35:59.330 --> 01:36:01.090
haven't followed them from Cubs but I'm
sure someone out there knows exactly

01:36:01.090 --> 01:36:01.100
sure someone out there knows exactly
 

01:36:01.100 --> 01:36:03.970
sure someone out there knows exactly
which month they were born in but 2013

01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:03.980
which month they were born in but 2013
 

01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:10.390
which month they were born in but 2013
is the year so either they're coming on

01:36:10.390 --> 01:36:10.400
is the year so either they're coming on
 

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:28.359
is the year so either they're coming on
six or they are already six years old

01:36:28.359 --> 01:36:28.369
 
 

01:36:28.369 --> 01:36:30.109
 
do you have an interesting question

01:36:30.109 --> 01:36:30.119
do you have an interesting question
 

01:36:30.119 --> 01:36:33.080
do you have an interesting question
you'd like to know if it's always the

01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:33.090
you'd like to know if it's always the
 

01:36:33.090 --> 01:36:37.310
you'd like to know if it's always the
same one that's missing or do they kind

01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:37.320
same one that's missing or do they kind
 

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:39.529
same one that's missing or do they kind
of rotate well it's not always the same

01:36:39.529 --> 01:36:39.539
of rotate well it's not always the same
 

01:36:39.539 --> 01:36:40.970
of rotate well it's not always the same
one that's missing because I have seen

01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:40.980
one that's missing because I have seen
 

01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.310
one that's missing because I have seen
them all so I suppose they do sort of

01:36:43.310 --> 01:36:43.320
them all so I suppose they do sort of
 

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:48.220
them all so I suppose they do sort of
rotate but also they're not constantly

01:36:48.220 --> 01:36:48.230
rotate but also they're not constantly
 

01:36:48.230 --> 01:36:53.240
rotate but also they're not constantly
sticking by each other's side within a

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:53.250
sticking by each other's side within a
 

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:56.660
sticking by each other's side within a
few meters you know they can always go

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:56.670
few meters you know they can always go
 

01:36:56.670 --> 01:36:58.520
few meters you know they can always go
off in their own and explore a bit and

01:36:58.520 --> 01:36:58.530
off in their own and explore a bit and
 

01:36:58.530 --> 01:37:05.509
off in their own and explore a bit and
then come back or regroup but I have

01:37:05.509 --> 01:37:05.519
then come back or regroup but I have
 

01:37:05.519 --> 01:37:07.700
then come back or regroup but I have
seen them all in fact I've seen them all

01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:07.710
seen them all in fact I've seen them all
 

01:37:07.710 --> 01:37:11.990
seen them all in fact I've seen them all
in on one day as well on Juma so they

01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000
in on one day as well on Juma so they
 

01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.310

01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:48.190
 
this is not an easy place to be driving

01:38:48.190 --> 01:38:48.200
this is not an easy place to be driving
 

01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:55.300
this is not an easy place to be driving
in fact it's eseni impossible now you're

01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:55.310
in fact it's eseni impossible now you're
 

01:38:55.310 --> 01:38:56.920
in fact it's eseni impossible now you're
going to have to go back out onto the

01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:56.930
going to have to go back out onto the
 

01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:59.530
going to have to go back out onto the
road and see if we can make our way

01:38:59.530 --> 01:38:59.540
road and see if we can make our way
 

01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:10.640
road and see if we can make our way
around where this a game park terminates

01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:12.630
 
Susan I think there are two reasons

01:39:12.630 --> 01:39:12.640
Susan I think there are two reasons
 

01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:14.729
Susan I think there are two reasons
she'd have abandoned that carcass and

01:39:14.729 --> 01:39:14.739
she'd have abandoned that carcass and
 

01:39:14.739 --> 01:39:16.680
she'd have abandoned that carcass and
not carried it to the den the first

01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:16.690
not carried it to the den the first
 

01:39:16.690 --> 01:39:20.790
not carried it to the den the first
reason is that she's a low-ranking hyena

01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800
reason is that she's a low-ranking hyena
 

01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.660
reason is that she's a low-ranking hyena
and therefore rather than take meat back

01:39:24.660 --> 01:39:24.670
and therefore rather than take meat back
 

01:39:24.670 --> 01:39:27.510
and therefore rather than take meat back
to the den often low ranking hyenas will

01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520
to the den often low ranking hyenas will
 

01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:29.910
to the den often low ranking hyenas will
eat away this years they'll eat away

01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920
eat away this years they'll eat away
 

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:33.330
eat away this years they'll eat away
from the den and then sort of convert

01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:33.340
from the den and then sort of convert
 

01:39:33.340 --> 01:39:35.850
from the den and then sort of convert
their energy if you like into milk and

01:39:35.850 --> 01:39:35.860
their energy if you like into milk and
 

01:39:35.860 --> 01:39:37.500
their energy if you like into milk and
take the milk back for their cubs

01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:37.510
take the milk back for their cubs
 

01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:39.600
take the milk back for their cubs
because only their own Cubs will suckle

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:39.610
because only their own Cubs will suckle
 

01:39:39.610 --> 01:39:43.110
because only their own Cubs will suckle
from them the other reason is I think

01:39:43.110 --> 01:39:43.120
from them the other reason is I think
 

01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:45.750
from them the other reason is I think
that it was obviously just distasteful

01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760
that it was obviously just distasteful
 

01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.420

realized that it was just going to be
too difficult and not worth her while to

01:40:05.070 --> 01:40:05.080
too difficult and not worth her while to
 

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:07.670
too difficult and not worth her while to
