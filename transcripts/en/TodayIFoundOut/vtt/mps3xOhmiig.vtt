00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:45.350
Fashion is an evolving beast with the fashionistas
of the world endlessly attempting to create

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.979
impossibly fabulous and unique new outfits
for fashion shows.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:55.059
A commonly seen element of such outfits is
that they’re often impractical, unwieldy

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.789
and, to the layperson, hilariously bizarre
looking.

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:04.920
So why don’t fashion shows just show off
clothes people might actually want to wear,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.700
instead of going with outlandish outfits?

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.860
It turns out, although not as popular as runways
shows intended to show off the latest so called

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.289
“high fashion” pieces, Prêt-à-Porter
(literally, “ready-to-wear”) shows are

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.739
held every single year by most of the top
brands in fashion.

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:25.149
Said shows, meant to show off what’s going
to be “hot” next season, invariably feature

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.540
regular items of clothing and outfits mostly
identical to what we, the customer, will eventually

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.380
be able to buy in stores, or at least, some
version of them.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.689
The fashion show pieces usually have a few
minor alterations made to accentuate a given

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.369
model’s figure, rather than being cut more
generically for the average consumer.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.429
Although popular within the sphere of fashion,
these shows seldom receive the kind of high

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.499
profile coverage Haute Couture fashion gets
in the press- a fact that segues into one

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:59.509
of the key reasons fashion at these particular
shows is occasionally outlandish.

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.350
The truth is that most of the crazy outfits
you see have one real purpose- relatively

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.409
cheap advertising.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.569
It turns out that creating a dress that looks
like it belongs in Lady Gaga’s closet and

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:15.430
featuring it prominently in a fashion show
is a relatively inexpensive way to get eyeballs

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.900
directed toward a particular designer’s
body of work, which of course is also akin

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.200
to why musicians like Lady Gaga frequently
pull the same stunt.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.800
With regards to fashion shows, as Susannah
Frankel, one time fashion editor for The Independent,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.170
states: “Although the more expensive shows
may cost upwards of £500,000, they still

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.849
work out cheaper than advertising campaigns
shot with big-name models and superstar photographers

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.419
and have a much more immediate and mainstream
audience.”

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:49.489
Wildly flamboyant or excessively fabulous
items of clothing are naturally going to pique

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:55.630
the interest of the press more and, as a result,
outfits seen at high fashion shows have been

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.560
getting progressively more ridiculous over
the years.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.699
Think of it as a fashion arms race where the
goal is to make an impossibly chiselled model

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:05.970
doing their best to stay straight faced look
as silly as possible.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.160
Looking beyond the consumer, these kind of
shows are also noted as functioning as a proving

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.400
ground of sorts for designers to show off
their skills via demonstrating the extremes

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.039
of what can be done with individual materials
and fabrics.

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:24.100
It should also be noted that while the clothes
seen on catwalks during high fashion shows

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:29.579
are generally never intended for sale, they
do often influence fashion in some way.

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:34.549
Said influences may be as subtle as the color
scheme shown off during a particular show

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:39.790
or the basic silhouette of clothing on display-
a popular example of the latter being skinny

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.250
jeans, which were widely mocked when first
seen on the catwalk before becoming the following

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.989
season’s “must have” item of clothing
and now relatively ubiquitous.

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.370
Of course, when using elements of a ridiculous
design, it is usually the case that designers

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.160
will greatly tone things down, drawing broadly
on ideas presented with the more garish outfits

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.310
worn by models to create something more palatable
to the general public.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.970
A comparable practise in another industry
is that of so-called “Concept Cars” created

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.580
by car manufacturers.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:08.160
Like high fashion, these cars are generally
designed more to both grab the press’s attention

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.670
and within the industry to showcase things
like a new manufacturing technique, material,

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:17.590
or feature, rather than the company actually
having any plans to manufacture and sell the

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.590
car shown.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.319
But, again as with high fashion, elements
from these concept cars are occasionally integrated

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:27.270
into more toned down cars later available
for sale to the public.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:33.240
Moving on to art side of things, it has been
argued that fashion, or more accurately high

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.020
fashion, should be considered a form of art,
with the most popular comparison between between

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.860
high fashion and modern art.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.139
However, a notable critic of fashion being
considered a form of art is fashion designer

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.760
and billionaire Miuccia Prada, a woman often
called “She Who Must Be Obeyed” within

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.850
the industry.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.620
For example, in an interview with New York
Magazine, Prada stated: “Art is for expressing

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.080
ideas and for expressing a vision.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.569
My job is to sell.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.270
And I like very much my job.”

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.699
But to conclude, the clothing at high fashion
shows looks garish and ridiculous for a number

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:10.150
of reasons, the most prominent among them
being to score some sweet column inches in

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.490
the news outlets of the world so as to also
bring more attention to a given designer or

00:05:15.490 --> 00:06:56.839
brand’s less outlandish product.
