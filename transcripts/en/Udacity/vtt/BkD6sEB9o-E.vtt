Well, when we plug in everything we know, we know at the very top the velocity is 0,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
and 0² is just 0, equals the initial velocity squared.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Well, 20² + 2aΔx, and Δx is our unknown.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If we solve this we move the 20² over here--20² is 400, so we have -400,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
equals 20  Δx, which means that Δx = - 20 m.

00:00:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Uh oh. I'm confused. What is this negative business?
