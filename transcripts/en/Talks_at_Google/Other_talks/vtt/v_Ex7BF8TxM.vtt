00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.370
JENNA TAYLOR: So today we
have chef Amelia Saltsman

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.189
with us-- distinguished author
of the "Santa Monica Farmers'

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.730
Market Cookbook"
which-- I don't know

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.960
if you guys have-- I love--
and the new "Seasonal Jewish

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.460
Kitchen."

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.960
So they let me play
today-- first time

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.277
I'm going to be back here.

00:00:17.277 --> 00:00:19.110
Hopefully, we're going
to have a great time.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.060
Thank you all for being here.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.960
Thank you for joining us.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.700
Welcome to Google.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.282
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Well, thank you for

00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:23.910
that wonderful introduction.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.853
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.090
My two favorite
words-- food literacy.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.420
That is my passion.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.560
And I learn right along with
everyone else as I do my work.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.870
And then the result of that is
the "Seasonal Jewish Kitchen,"

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.344
my new cookbook, that really
took me one step-- no,

00:00:47.344 --> 00:00:51.430
many, many, millennia
back to what we do today--

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.680
seasonal sustainable
cooking as a way

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:03.850
to make our lives easier,
simpler, healthier,

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.480
and, by the way,
save the planet.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.930
It's all right there
in how we cook.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.780
And what I discovered is that
that-- what we do today--

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.230
has really ancient roots--
really exciting to me.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:16.862
That's my new food
literacy right here.

00:01:16.862 --> 00:01:18.070
JENNA TAYLOR: To us, as well.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.250
Yeah.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.280
Very important to Google--
all of those things.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.071
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So
what I want to do today

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:26.380
is I want to show you some
simple tricks and techniques

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.890
that are really going to
make that so much easier--

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.890
to get dinner on the table
at home after a busy day

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.390
and answer all those questions
we just talked about.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.674
And I'm so delighted to
be cooking with you today.

00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:40.590
JENNA TAYLOR: Me, too.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.600
AMELIA SALTSMAN: I know--
girlfriends in the kitchen.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.960
It's great.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.030
Today we're going to do two
recipes from the "Seasonal

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.940
Jewish Kitchen"-- Yemenite
Pumpkin Carrot Soup-- well,

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.530
today we're doing a parsley
pesto to top it off.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.570
And this is a Middle Eastern
tweak on a classic, kind of,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.100
fall-winter soup.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.190
Right?

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.430
And the other recipe
we're going to do

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.630
is an Apple, Fennel,
and Watermelon Radish

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.530
Salad-- refreshing, gorgeous
counterpoint to winter dishes,

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.660
if we actually got winter.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:16.500
JENNA TAYLOR: Sounds amazing.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.460
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So I think
we should get started.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:19.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Let's go.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.721
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So we're
going to start with the soup.

00:02:21.721 --> 00:02:25.720
And I like to consider
this a master recipe.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.170
I think everything
should be-- have

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.700
a template that you can then
use in a lot of different ways.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.720
So we're always going
to start with aromatics.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.180
We want to build flavor.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.970
Jenna, if you want to
get the pot heated--

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.340
this nice, big, wide soup pot.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.550
I think it's over here.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.141
Yeah.

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:44.640
Right.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.544
Oh, you know this stove well.

00:02:46.544 --> 00:02:48.210
JENNA TAYLOR: Notoriously
tricky stoves.

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.560
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:49.070
So maybe--

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.830
JENNA TAYLOR: You
have to be smarter

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.510
than the average
Googler to use them.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.282
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And we always
want to start with an onion.

00:02:57.282 --> 00:02:57.880
Well, no.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.930
We shouldn't say while
we start with an onion,

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.050
but if you eat onions,
it's a great way to start.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.100
And I like to cut it in half.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.595
And then you can just
peel back the layers.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.180
And, Jenna, if you want
to cut an onion as well.

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.250
I think we'll just probably
used one in the soup

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.950
that we're cooking today.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.120
And I like to simply cut-- I
leave the root end attached

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.270
protecting my fingers.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.110
And then I turn
the onion and chop.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.340
So we just need a gentle,
homestyle, medium chop

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.030
to our onion.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.553
And I guess we'll make that a
dump bowl for compost later.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.690
And once the pot is warm--
so we want to warm the pot,

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.200
and then we're going
to add our onion.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.010
And we've also
gotten some celery.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.500
Now, celery is a
really lovely aromatic.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.180
Great celery has
a terrific flavor.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.230
So let's start with oil.

00:04:22.244 --> 00:04:24.160
We're going to use-- and
you think that's hot?

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.330
Well, we'll find out.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.820
Let's see if the oil shimmers.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.520
Why, yes, it is.

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.350
That's what you're looking for.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.599
When the pot is hot
but not smoking,

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.140
you're going to get the oil--
it's going to liquify and start

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.290
to shimmer.

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:37.617
And when you put something in--

00:04:37.617 --> 00:04:38.116
[SIZZLE]

00:04:38.116 --> 00:04:38.930
[GASP]

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.920
--you'll get a nice sizzle which
will start flavors building.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.060
So we're going to go
ahead and add celery.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.400
And be sure to look for those
tender leaves in the middle.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.560
The tender stocks that are
whiter and the pale green

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.380
leaves-- they add
a lot of flavor.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:03.830
And we're going to add a
couple of chopped carrots.

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:10.930
I love this great combination
of carrots together with pumpkin

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:17.880
because what I find is
that the carrot really

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.310
balances the flavor
of the winter squash.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.750
Sometimes squash can
be a little vegetal,

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.680
and this way it, sort of,
tones it down and really

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.860
makes it very nice.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:39.210
And we finely chop them so they
can get lots of all around-- we

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.020
can develop color and
flavor right away.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.462
So we're going to let
those cook-- medium heat.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:47.920
We don't want them
to brown, but we

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.950
want them to get really soft.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.070
And here's a simple trick.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.780
Great cooking is as simple as
adding salt in layers-- salt

00:05:58.780 --> 00:05:59.350
as you go.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.040
So let's say you want a teaspoon
of salt in the whole recipe.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.960
Maybe a quarter of a
teaspoon right now-- it's

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.022
very different than just
dumping a teaspoon at the end.

00:06:09.022 --> 00:06:10.730
JENNA TAYLOR: I always
wonder about that.

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.020
Whether to-- I feel like
you salt ingredients

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.420
individually and then
layer the flavors.

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:16.830
But some say add it at the end.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.895
I like the idea
of building it in.

00:06:18.895 --> 00:06:19.770
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yes.

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.175
It really makes-- you try it.

00:06:22.175 --> 00:06:24.464
Try the experiment.

00:06:24.464 --> 00:06:26.130
We'll let that-- we
don't want-- we just

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.390
want to let it go gently.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.090
And let's talk about the
squash that we're going to add.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:40.791
So anybody ever try
to cut a raw squash?

00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:41.290
[LAUGHS]

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:42.410
JENNA TAYLOR: You better
have a sharp knife,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.975
or you're going
to hurt yourself.

00:06:43.975 --> 00:06:46.720
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Yeah-- not so easy.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:53.290
So here's the trick-- a
home cooks' best trick.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:54.880
Don't cut it.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.730
Put it in a hot oven--
maybe 375-- something

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:02.270
like that-- whole
on a sheet pan.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:05.520
You can protect it with foil
or a parchment, if you like.

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.430
Just shove that baby into
a hot oven until it's soft.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.750
And then-- I think I'm going
to let you do the honors.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.030
OK, Jenna?

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:17.649
I want you to just cut it.

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:19.190
You can use the
knife of your choice.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.840
JENNA TAYLOR:
Right over the top?

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.881
Just, right-- the top off
or right in the middle?

00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.820
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah--
right through the equator.

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.704
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, much easier
than last time I cut a squash.

00:07:27.704 --> 00:07:29.120
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Oh, look at that.

00:07:30.651 --> 00:07:31.150
OK.

00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.390
Can you all see?

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.670
You all got a good look?

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:37.677
So then-- let's see.

00:07:37.677 --> 00:07:38.760
I'm going to grab a spoon.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:43.080
Then it's really a
very simple matter

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.970
to simply scoop out the seeds.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.170
Oh, look at that.

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:48.620
You can save the
seeds, of course,

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:54.810
if you like to roast or plant.

00:07:54.810 --> 00:08:00.520
And then you can
now-- this recipe

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:08.240
would call for 3 cups of squash
which I would prefer weighing.

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:13.430
So you just scoop it right onto
a scale till you get to-- oh,

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:15.070
we're in grams.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.602
So we're going to
do about 750 grams.

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:20.060
I don't know if
we're going to have

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:24.370
enough in this small
squash but that'll be fine.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.240
So there you go--
instant squash puree.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.748
JENNA TAYLOR: And do you need to
prick it or anything like that?

00:08:32.748 --> 00:08:33.789
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Nothing.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:34.929
JENNA TAYLOR:
Literally, throw it in.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.200
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Just
literally throw it in.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.390
You might wipe it down
if its got a lot of dirt

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:39.250
from the garden.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:40.550
But that's it.

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:41.630
That's it.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.160
JENNA TAYLOR: Would that work
for a spaghetti squash, do you

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:44.660
think?

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:45.132
AMELIA SALTSMAN: It would.

00:08:45.132 --> 00:08:46.510
It works for any squash.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:53.010
Now, the smaller
squashes you can easily

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.840
cut in half-- like
a butternut squash.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.607
Those aren't that
hard to cut in half.

00:08:56.607 --> 00:08:57.440
And those would be--

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.350
JENNA TAYLOR: Like a
pumpkin or something?

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.308
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Right.

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:02.110
JENNA TAYLOR: Big
acorn squash or--

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:04.989
AUDIENCE: You said 375
degrees for how long?

00:09:04.989 --> 00:09:06.530
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Oh, until it's soft.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:09.113
So it might take-- like, this
might have taken an hour.

00:09:09.113 --> 00:09:10.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.670
AMELIA SALTSMAN: The
question was, how long?

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.360
So that's the
thing about dealing

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.350
with the properties
of natural foods--

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:27.480
whole foods-- which is that
every one is a little bit

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:27.980
different.

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.000
This might be drier.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.070
It might be more dense.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:31.670
It might be more watery.

00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:34.700
But you do want to look
for a squash like this

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:39.770
that-- like a kabocha--
something like that that

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.890
has a lot of starch and
not a lot of water--

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.960
not a Halloween-- well,
we'll have this ready to go.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.360
JENNA TAYLOR: Great.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:52.950
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Not
a jack-o-lantern.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:55.256
JENNA TAYLOR: So after
carving, don't cook it.

00:09:55.256 --> 00:09:57.630
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well, those
aren't designed for cooking.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.360
There are a lot of great
squashes out there that are.

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:06.550
So we can see what's happening
here is that we're developing.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.640
The color is heightening,
if you can see.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.160
And it's really telling us that
it's bringing the flavor out.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.460
JENNA TAYLOR: Smells amazing.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:15.918
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Already, you know?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:24.580
So we can add-- you can also
make the soup with raw cut

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.930
up squash if you
have a strong friend.

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.130
OK-- a lot of work.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.130
JENNA TAYLOR: Do you find
there's any difference

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.040
texturally, or in
timing-wise, or anything

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.660
if you're doing it with raw?

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.585
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
You know, I prefer

00:10:38.585 --> 00:10:40.710
to cook with something
roasted because I've already

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:45.770
caramelized the flavors.

00:10:45.770 --> 00:10:48.940
And I had reduced
the moisture so

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:53.110
that I have the natural sugars
concentrated in flavors.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:59.950
And I think that is one
of another key trick.

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:01.590
It's not hard to do.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.540
JENNA TAYLOR: Roasting
vegetables is perhaps

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.292
my favorite kitchen technique.

00:11:05.292 --> 00:11:06.250
AMELIA SALTSMAN: It is.

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:06.590
It is.

00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:07.710
JENNA TAYLOR: It's so easy,
and it's so delicious.

00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:08.740
And you can do it
with everything.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.530
And everybody's always
like, I've never

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.575
had [INAUDIBLE] vegetable
this tasty before.

00:11:12.575 --> 00:11:14.158
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
That's exactly right.

00:11:14.158 --> 00:11:17.390
You need one sheet pan, a
little bit of olive oil,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:20.255
some great salt, and then
the world's your oyster.

00:11:20.255 --> 00:11:21.755
JENNA TAYLOR: Pretty
much-- whatever

00:11:21.755 --> 00:11:23.612
is at the farmers'
market-- roast it.

00:11:23.612 --> 00:11:24.570
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Right.

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:25.830
And it all tastes different.

00:11:25.830 --> 00:11:27.996
JENNA TAYLOR: And
it's all delicious.

00:11:27.996 --> 00:11:29.121
AMELIA SALTSMAN: All right.

00:11:29.121 --> 00:11:30.990
So I think we're ready
for our next step.

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.530
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:33.030
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
So now, we've built

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:35.000
our first layer of flavor.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.030
We're going to add
the squash, and we're

00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:41.180
going to add some seasoning.

00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:42.800
We're going to add
a little more salt.

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:47.050
So, Jenna, if you want
to give a little-- now,

00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:49.980
what makes this soup
a Yemenite soup,

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:56.740
in particular, is the blend
of spices that were used.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:04.260
And this is hawaij which is a
Yemenite blend of coriander,

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.745
and cumin, and black pepper.

00:12:06.745 --> 00:12:13.410
Black pepper is
used a lot in Yemen

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:18.060
but also turmeric which
adds a yellow color.

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:18.560
Let's see.

00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.059
What else?

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:21.710
Turmeric-- cloves,
you might have.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:23.776
So it's this very--

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:24.770
JENNA TAYLOR: Fragant?

00:12:24.770 --> 00:12:26.190
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
--very fragrant,

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:29.949
aromatic-- I wouldn't quite go
to floral but getting there.

00:12:29.949 --> 00:12:30.740
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:32.490
AMELIA SALTSMAN: --and
really distinctive.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.850
And so we're creating
a simple soup,

00:12:35.850 --> 00:12:38.580
and yet we're elevating it
a little bit with something,

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.000
maybe, we don't eat every day.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:40.999
JENNA TAYLOR: Squash in?

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:44.590
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Squash in and
let's give a good dose of this.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.230
Now, if you don't
have hawaij, which

00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:50.740
is available in Middle Eastern
stores, buy-- basically,

00:12:50.740 --> 00:12:55.480
use a mix of coriander, and
cumin, and black pepper.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.800
And you'll be good to go.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.930
So again, layering flavor--
we're bringing it up.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:06.372
By cooking it, we haven't
added any liquid yet.

00:13:06.372 --> 00:13:08.322
JENNA TAYLOR: Smells amazing.

00:13:08.322 --> 00:13:09.780
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Can you all smell?

00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:10.780
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh man.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.746
Sense waves flying
out to all of you.

00:13:15.686 --> 00:13:16.810
AMELIA SALTSMAN: All right.

00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:20.500
And now, we're going
to ladle in some stock.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:26.800
Now, if you can,
heat the stock first.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.620
It'll get your
cooking going faster.

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.060
If you don't have time, you
don't want to use the pot--

00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:34.200
don't.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:34.870
We can add--

00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:35.630
JENNA TAYLOR: Just
chicken stock?

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:35.870
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Right.

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:38.190
And we're using vegetable
stock, so this is a soup

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:39.740
that just happens to be vegan.

00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:41.240
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh,
vegan-- I love it.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.010
AMELIA SALTSMAN: I
love added value.

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.640
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah, absolutely.

00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.889
AMELIA SALTSMAN: We go for
flavor first and then added

00:13:44.889 --> 00:13:46.010
value.

00:13:46.010 --> 00:13:50.500
So chicken stock would be great.

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.436
That would make it
even more Yemenite.

00:13:53.436 --> 00:13:54.310
JENNA TAYLOR: Savory.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.610
AMELIA SALTSMAN: --savory
and that Yemenite quality.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.182
So we're going to
add about 4 cups.

00:13:59.182 --> 00:13:59.890
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:13:59.890 --> 00:14:02.056
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And we're
going to let that simmer.

00:14:02.056 --> 00:14:05.750
And here's another
home cook trick.

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:10.660
While something is simmering--
long task-- unattended--

00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:12.170
do something else.

00:14:12.170 --> 00:14:13.181
So we're going--

00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:14.430
JENNA TAYLOR: Time management.

00:14:14.430 --> 00:14:17.510
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Time management.

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:20.870
The next thing we're going
to do is make our pesto.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:28.080
So this lovely condiment
will dress up a soup.

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.590
It'll dress up a lot of things.

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:30.220
It's very nice.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.650
You can make it either
with-- thank you, Chef.

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:37.110
You can either make it with
parsley, as we're doing today,

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:40.165
or cilantro which
is very, very nice.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:48.280
So a good handful of
leaves-- I would say,

00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:51.000
maybe, a 1/4 cup packed.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.045
And I think what
we're going to do is--

00:14:54.045 --> 00:14:56.875
JENNA TAYLOR: Do I need to
turn this down for simmer?

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:58.500
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
We're going to-- well,

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.990
we'll bring it up
to a good simmer.

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.781
And, you know what?

00:15:00.781 --> 00:15:04.640
Let's throw in a
handful of these.

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.520
Now, here's another
little trick.

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.210
When they're whole and
you cook them down,

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:12.430
they will just get sweeter.

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:13.410
JENNA TAYLOR: Melty.

00:15:13.410 --> 00:15:15.900
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Melty
sweet as opposed to chopping

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:20.920
and releasing all of
those-- all of the pungency.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.500
So we're going to add a couple
of cloves of garlic here.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.770
I think I'm going to give
them a rough chop first.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:30.556
So this is a very
simple condiment.

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:36.045
And you'll notice,
really, that we

00:15:36.045 --> 00:15:39.790
are-- other than the spice
mix-- we are flavoring food

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.140
with food.

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.440
We are using the ingredients
from the farmers' market.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.100
JENNA TAYLOR: I
love that way to say

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:51.399
it-- flavoring food with food--
not additives-- other food.

00:15:51.399 --> 00:15:52.440
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Exactly.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.460
JENNA TAYLOR: That was simple
but a little bit profound

00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:56.130
these days, when
you think about it.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.040
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Mm.

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.610
And we need about
a teaspoon of salt.

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.050
We're making a nice condiment.

00:16:01.050 --> 00:16:04.120
And we'll take the olive oil.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:06.418
And is this plugged in, Chef?

00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:07.876
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah--
looks like it.

00:16:07.876 --> 00:16:10.310
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK.

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:15.490
So we're going to work in--
oh, about 1/3 or 1/2 cup

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:16.190
of olive oil.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:22.130
And if you want to
start grinding that up.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.130
JENNA TAYLOR: Throw the
outboard motor in there?

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:24.530
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:25.930
JENNA TAYLOR: All right.

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:29.760
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Stick blender--
another cook's favorite tool.

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:33.040
[BLENDER GRINDING]

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:33.967
This will keep.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:47.681
So I love using this.

00:16:47.681 --> 00:16:49.180
This will keep in
your refrigerator.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:54.730
I would make a double,
triple batch of this

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:57.870
and just use it on
grilled chicken--

00:16:57.870 --> 00:16:59.630
just wherever you need a hit.

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:05.500
And it's going to be our
final flavor layer on the top.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.079
And I want to get our apple--
our salads [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:16.430
You know, we forgot to
add parsley to the soup.

00:17:16.430 --> 00:17:18.459
I'm just going throw in this.

00:17:18.459 --> 00:17:21.010
Oh, you know, this is how you
cook it [INAUDIBLE]-- parsley.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Looks
perfect to me.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.240
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Can you all
see how gorgeous that is?

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:31.750
JENNA TAYLOR: What kind--
are we-- texturally-- Chef,

00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:33.460
is this texturally
what we're going for?

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:34.800
Do we need to emulsify it more?

00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.675
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yes.

00:17:35.675 --> 00:17:37.450
No, I think that's lovely.

00:17:37.450 --> 00:17:40.510
Easy to drizzle-- just lovely.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.030
So we'll set that aside.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:46.190
So this is ready to go on
our soup when it's done.

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:47.330
So let's make our salad.

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:48.128
You ready?

00:17:48.128 --> 00:17:49.128
JENNA TAYLOR: Yes ma'am.

00:17:51.684 --> 00:17:54.100
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Really great
tool-- do you use this tool?

00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:54.930
JENNA TAYLOR: Love.

00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:56.950
Love-- just don't
get your finger.

00:17:56.950 --> 00:17:58.533
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh,
I'm going to show

00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:00.612
you a trick for that, too.

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:01.530
OK.

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:04.140
And I like to work
right into the bowl,

00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.220
so we'll leave that here.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:07.950
And we'll start with radishes.

00:18:07.950 --> 00:18:12.160
So this is our apple, fennel,
and watermelon radish salad.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.650
And I get so tired of people--
it's, like, oh, it's December.

00:18:15.650 --> 00:18:17.520
I can't get good tomatoes.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.630
I don't know what to do.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:19.130
Right?

00:18:19.130 --> 00:18:22.600
Well, buy what's ready.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:28.390
And there are so
many salads to have.

00:18:28.390 --> 00:18:31.270
Watermelon radishes--
what a surprise inside.

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:33.595
Sometimes it's nice to
give them a little peel

00:18:33.595 --> 00:18:41.300
if we have-- here we go-- one
to you-- because sometimes it

00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:46.320
releases the pretty
color so it really does.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.320
It doesn't taste
like a watermelon.

00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.010
It looks like a watermelon,
but it's a lovely radish.

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:55.744
And, you know, we
eat with our eyes.

00:18:55.744 --> 00:18:59.310
JENNA TAYLOR: Just got one of
these in my CSA box this week.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:01.562
It's the perfect excuse
to do this salad.

00:19:01.562 --> 00:19:03.020
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Well, and you know

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.150
what I love about a
CSA box is-- first

00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:09.380
of all, besides supporting your
local farmers who certainly

00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:10.570
need our help.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.410
Don't they-- with
this crazy climate?

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.493
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah-- with
the drought, especially.

00:19:14.493 --> 00:19:16.240
Yeah.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.690
But it forces me to--
well, not "forces"

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:21.250
but it gives me an excuse to
cook things I might not have

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.280
necessarily cooked before or
that I wouldn't-- might be

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.854
intimidated to pick up at the
store or the farmers' market.

00:19:26.854 --> 00:19:28.270
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Well, and I think

00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:29.640
that's a very good
point because there

00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.010
are so many things-- people
say, oh, we don't have that.

00:19:32.010 --> 00:19:33.010
And I'm thinking--

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:33.780
JENNA TAYLOR: You probably do.

00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.240
AMELIA SALTSMAN: You
just never noticed it.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.448
It was hiding in plain sight.

00:19:36.448 --> 00:19:37.355
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:19:37.355 --> 00:19:39.855
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So these are
quite large, but you can see--

00:19:39.855 --> 00:19:40.896
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, pretty.

00:19:40.896 --> 00:19:43.290
Has everybody seen the inside
of a watermelon radish--

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.540
so incredibly beautiful.

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:45.140
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
I mean, why not?

00:19:45.140 --> 00:19:46.514
Look at what nature
has given us.

00:19:46.514 --> 00:19:47.920
We might as well take advantage.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.010
Thank goodness the farmers
are giving it to us.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.690
JENNA TAYLOR: And
all radishes are not

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:56.090
white and red little
globes of crunchiness.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.820
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So
these radishes already

00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:01.800
had their stems removed,
but what I like to do

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:05.660
is leave an inch of
the stem attached.

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:06.645
That's your handle.

00:20:06.645 --> 00:20:08.020
JENNA TAYLOR:
That's your handle?

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.430
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Natural handle.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:10.730
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:14.090
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So we'll
just stop a little early.

00:20:14.090 --> 00:20:19.390
So then what happens is this
tool makes for fast slicing

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.060
but also wonderful texture.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.250
It's thin.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:22.880
It's lovely.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.296
So when you taste the salad,
you're going to have all this

00:20:25.296 --> 00:20:29.775
wonderful contrast in each
bite-- the pungent radish--

00:20:29.775 --> 00:20:31.150
JENNA TAYLOR: And
uniform, right?

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:33.714
So if you are doing like a
gratin or something where you

00:20:33.714 --> 00:20:34.880
need all your slices to be--

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:36.880
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well,
now you're getting fancy.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.380
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, I'm just
saying-- seasonal dishes.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:43.680
If you want to give us a
couple of radishes into there.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.370
And here you go, if
you finish those.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:51.670
I'm going to start with the
next flavor component-- fennel.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:56.900
So now we have some great,
big bulbs of fennel.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.810
And can I have
that scissors back?

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.841
Can somebody reach
me that scissors?

00:21:02.841 --> 00:21:03.340
Thank you.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.290
So, again, flavoring
food with food.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:13.634
Here is our fennel bulb.

00:21:13.634 --> 00:21:15.550
You might say, well,
what does this have to do

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:17.710
with seasonal Jewish cooking?

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:20.200
Well, fennel is,
actually, traditionally,

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.780
a rich vegetable.

00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:22.280
It may be--

00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:23.405
JENNA TAYLOR: Is it really?

00:21:23.405 --> 00:21:24.380
AMELIA SALTSMAN: It is.

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:27.710
It may be iconic
to Italian cooking,

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:30.670
but it wasn't until the
beginning of the 19th century

00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.617
that it became a mainstream
Italian food which I think

00:21:33.617 --> 00:21:34.575
is kind of interesting.

00:21:34.575 --> 00:21:35.866
JENNA TAYLOR: It's fascinating.

00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:38.770
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Food
literacy-- new factoid.

00:21:38.770 --> 00:21:44.409
So it's got a sweet and
slightly licorice quality to it.

00:21:44.409 --> 00:21:45.450
So it's really different.

00:21:45.450 --> 00:21:48.340
It's very complex.

00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.290
And, of course, the
fronds are lovely.

00:21:50.290 --> 00:21:52.210
We're going to be able
to save some of those

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:54.400
and use them in our salad.

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.750
So, again, we're going
to remove this for now.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:07.380
I've already left my handle--
going to cut it in half.

00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.640
If it has a big tough core,
you can cut some of that out.

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:18.240
And then I like to remove the
tougher, outer layers to make

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:19.850
for a more tender salad.

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:22.890
And this happens to have lobes.

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.920
And then we're ready to
grate, and this is my handle.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:26.920
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, great.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.420
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
[INAUDIBLE], OK.

00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:28.070
There you go.

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.070
JENNA TAYLOR: Right in
here with these radishes?

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:31.980
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Right in there,
we're making the salad right

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:32.655
into the bowl.

00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:37.194
And I'll just get
those ready for you.

00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:44.290
OK.

00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:44.920
There you go.

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:51.920
And I'm going to move
right on to the apples.

00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:57.970
So now, we've got this,
sort of, slightly licorice,

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:01.330
crisp, crunchy fennel going on.

00:23:01.330 --> 00:23:05.342
And now, of course, our lovely--
these look like pink ladies.

00:23:05.342 --> 00:23:06.050
JENNA TAYLOR: Mm.

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:07.633
AMELIA SALTSMAN: One
of my favorites--

00:23:07.633 --> 00:23:10.730
so we're going to get the sweet,
tart, and beautiful color.

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:15.310
Trick-- trick alert--
to core an apple quickly

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.520
for this purpose-- I'm
going to cut it in half.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.760
I'm going to cut it in quarters.

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.070
And then I'm just going
to cut out the core.

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:29.610
OK?

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:31.110
Without another knife.

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Very, very cool.

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.996
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Very cool, right?

00:23:33.996 --> 00:23:35.780
And so then that's
just ready to cut

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.190
into these wonderful
little pieces.

00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.910
So we'll use a couple of apples.

00:23:40.910 --> 00:23:46.420
And then the other piece we're
going to put in this salad

00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:54.860
is-- we're going to use some
lovely winter salad greens.

00:23:54.860 --> 00:24:00.320
Now, you know, leafy things--
there's more than lettuce.

00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.830
There's more than lettuce.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.760
So in winter we have a lot--
it's really fascinating to me

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:13.770
because in winter we have leafy
greens that taste like winter.

00:24:13.770 --> 00:24:14.270
You know?

00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:15.360
They're a little meatier.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.780
They're heartier.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:19.370
They might have spice to
them-- all the things we

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.780
like at this time of the year.

00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:30.660
And when we add those to a
salad and we're serving them

00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:34.100
with winter fare--
hearty stew-- things

00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:38.200
like that-- it just feels right.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.130
And one of the
things that I noticed

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:44.390
when I was doing the
book is that the foods

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:46.600
that we want to eat--
that we gravitate

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.930
toward during the
holiday season tend

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:55.920
to be the foods, historically,
that, of course, are in season.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.610
We just kind of lost track
somewhere along the line.

00:24:59.610 --> 00:25:01.690
JENNA TAYLOR: With the
way food is sold today,

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:05.570
it's very easy to misunderstand
what is and isn't in season,

00:25:05.570 --> 00:25:08.415
especially if you don't look
at where it's coming from.

00:25:08.415 --> 00:25:09.540
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Precisely.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:10.210
Precisely.

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.200
And that's why it's
really important for us

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:17.660
to educate ourselves and to
really use all our senses-- use

00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.260
our smarts.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.760
We forget when it comes
to food-- sometimes

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.370
we don't trust our instincts.

00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:23.250
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:25.990
If the tomatoes are
white, it's probably

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:27.245
not the time to buy a tomato.

00:25:27.245 --> 00:25:28.370
AMELIA SALTSMAN: You think?

00:25:28.370 --> 00:25:28.955
You think?

00:25:28.955 --> 00:25:30.580
JENNA TAYLOR: Whatever
looks and smells

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:33.280
the best is probably in season.

00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.899
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So I'm going
to add just some of the this.

00:25:35.899 --> 00:25:36.690
I think we're good.

00:25:36.690 --> 00:25:37.070
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah?

00:25:37.070 --> 00:25:37.360
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.270
I think we've got--

00:25:38.270 --> 00:25:39.550
JENNA TAYLOR: Beautiful.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:44.270
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So I'm going
to use the best stirring tool

00:25:44.270 --> 00:25:45.784
known to man and womankind.

00:25:45.784 --> 00:25:47.450
JENNA TAYLOR: Everybody
has two of them.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:54.360
AMELIA SALTSMAN: I'm gauging
what I want to do here.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.250
I don't want this to be a green
salad with a few little things.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:00.860
I want lots of texture.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:07.700
So I've looked to see how
much-- what my balance is.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.250
But you can see
what's happening.

00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:12.680
JENNA TAYLOR: Is it, maybe,
equal parts of everything?

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.360
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Something like-- I

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.450
would say we would prefer
two-ish of everything

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.670
and then a couple of
handfuls-ish of everything.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:20.545
JENNA TAYLOR: Greens?

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.567
OK.

00:26:22.567 --> 00:26:24.150
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And
we're going to go

00:26:24.150 --> 00:26:32.670
with that other lovely autumn
and winter essence-- walnuts--

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:33.637
toasted walnuts.

00:26:33.637 --> 00:26:34.970
And you know why you toast them?

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:37.190
You toast them to
develop flavor.

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:38.590
How's our soup doing?

00:26:38.590 --> 00:26:40.661
JENNA TAYLOR: It looks glorious.

00:26:40.661 --> 00:26:42.160
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
So a nice handful--

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:46.550
toast them-- 350 degrees--
about 10 minutes.

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:47.620
The flavor comes up.

00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.050
The aroma comes
up-- you'll know.

00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.720
I like to season a
salad right in the bowl.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:58.130
You don't need to
make another dressing.

00:26:58.130 --> 00:27:00.390
You don't need another bowl.

00:27:00.390 --> 00:27:02.600
A couple of good
squeezes-- all you

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.730
need is a tablespoon
or two of oil.

00:27:04.730 --> 00:27:05.830
You can always add more.

00:27:05.830 --> 00:27:07.621
JENNA TAYLOR: And walnut
oil, in this case?

00:27:07.621 --> 00:27:09.410
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Walnut
oil which I love.

00:27:09.410 --> 00:27:12.540
Be sure and get a
good one because it's

00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.430
a flavor component.

00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:19.850
And let's see-- salt. Now,
I'm using kosher salt here,

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:24.620
but what would be really nice
is a crunchy, finishing salt

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:30.540
like Maldon or fleur de sel,
but Maldon is particularly nice.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:35.420
Again, generous pinch or two
and you can always add more.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:42.010
And flavoring food
with food-- five hole

00:27:42.010 --> 00:27:45.660
zester-- not a big deal, but
it does this wonderful thing.

00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.840
Do it right over the salad.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.805
It releases-- I
can see the spray.

00:27:49.805 --> 00:27:51.150
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah-- sprang up.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:52.066
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:56.100
Can you smell it--
even from there, right?

00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:02.840
And it just adds this beautiful,
beautiful long strands.

00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:08.720
It's beautiful, but it's
adding flavor and mouth feel.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:16.850
Then we can just give a
nice squeeze of lemon.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:19.457
And that, my friends,
is the salad dressing.

00:28:19.457 --> 00:28:21.540
Do we have something that
we're going to toss this

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.292
with besides our hands?

00:28:24.292 --> 00:28:25.250
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm sure.

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.400
A couple of wooden
spoons, or some tongs,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.050
or what do we think?

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:31.422
Thank you.

00:28:31.422 --> 00:28:32.880
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
And meanwhile, I'm

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:40.230
going to give a little hair
cut with these wonderful fronds

00:28:40.230 --> 00:28:41.630
right into the salad.

00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:43.430
You can save the
rest of the fronds

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:45.695
for using with
fish-- wrapping fish.

00:28:45.695 --> 00:28:46.320
It's wonderful.

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.890
JENNA TAYLOR: Ooh, wrapping
fish-- that's a fun one.

00:28:50.890 --> 00:28:57.760
Oh, this smells so
bright and fragrant.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:01.820
AMELIA SALTSMAN: It really
is a lovely component

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:02.920
of a winter meal.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.760
JENNA TAYLOR: I'm seeing my
Christmas salad come together.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.125
[LAUGHS]

00:29:08.125 --> 00:29:10.226
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Oh,
the options are endless.

00:29:10.226 --> 00:29:12.100
JENNA TAYLOR: Well, I
knew I wanted something

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.590
with these notes.

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.232
Now I can say, I learned
it from a professional.

00:29:17.232 --> 00:29:18.829
[LAUGHS]

00:29:18.829 --> 00:29:21.370
AMELIA SALTSMAN: You know, let's
make it even more beautiful.

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:29.900
If we take one of those
platters-- and then what

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:34.560
I think is wonderful-- I
think a salad is so beautiful

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:40.970
mounted so that you
really can appreciate

00:29:40.970 --> 00:29:47.138
every beautiful thing that
you've put in this salad,

00:29:47.138 --> 00:29:48.380
right?

00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:50.250
And, oh, look at
that wonderful lemon.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:52.927
It's just drifting
off everywhere.

00:29:55.670 --> 00:29:57.815
JENNA TAYLOR: Really beautiful.

00:29:57.815 --> 00:29:59.190
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Isn't that nice?

00:29:59.190 --> 00:30:01.457
JENNA TAYLOR: And so easy.

00:30:01.457 --> 00:30:02.290
AMELIA SALTSMAN: OK.

00:30:02.290 --> 00:30:04.320
So now, we've got
our salad ready.

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.970
And this salad-- the nice thing
about winter ingredients--

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:09.840
this salad can sit.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:10.850
You can just make it.

00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:14.140
It'll be fine for an hour or
so while you do something else.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.690
It'll be fine even for a couple
hours which is really nice.

00:30:19.690 --> 00:30:22.920
So meantime, let's
finish our soup.

00:30:22.920 --> 00:30:27.160
So what we've got--
well, this looks pretty

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.940
[INAUDIBLE] but we can finish.

00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:29.440
Let's see.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.780
Let's take a taste and
see what we've got.

00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:35.780
OK.

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.734
So by the magic of Chef Didi--

00:30:39.734 --> 00:30:41.699
JENNA TAYLOR: Ooh.

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:43.490
AMELIA SALTSMAN: We
are going to-- so we're

00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:44.570
going to puree this one.

00:30:44.570 --> 00:30:45.420
JENNA TAYLOR: OK.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.090
AMELIA SALTSMAN: All right.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.600
So let's see, we need
our stick blender.

00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.420
JENNA TAYLOR: Gotcha.

00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:54.300
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
And I don't know

00:30:54.300 --> 00:30:56.480
how hot this is underneath.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.077
No, it's fine.

00:30:59.077 --> 00:31:00.410
JENNA TAYLOR: Wherever you like.

00:31:00.410 --> 00:31:03.650
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well,
wherever we have a good visual.

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:07.091
Can you all see what
we're doing here?

00:31:07.091 --> 00:31:07.590
All right.

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:08.000
Yes?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:08.500
No?

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.098
Move it?

00:31:09.098 --> 00:31:10.005
[LAUGHS]

00:31:10.005 --> 00:31:11.338
JENNA TAYLOR: Slide under there.

00:31:11.338 --> 00:31:13.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:13.215 --> 00:31:14.840
JENNA TAYLOR: We'll
move it over there.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.965
AMELIA SALTSMAN: All right.

00:31:15.965 --> 00:31:20.081
JENNA TAYLOR: Let's move to this
one so we can-- there we go.

00:31:20.081 --> 00:31:20.580
All right.

00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:25.740
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So, again,
we can-- so we're just-- now,

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.465
you can see this soup-- Chef
made this with the raw squash.

00:31:29.465 --> 00:31:34.450
So you can see we have these
nice soft cubes of squash

00:31:34.450 --> 00:31:38.520
that have given their
all to the soup.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.400
And let's see--

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.370
[BLENDER GRINDING]

00:31:43.370 --> 00:31:45.170
--and just puree
right in the pot.

00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.030
And we're going to
need our soup bowls.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:54.780
JENNA TAYLOR: Yes.

00:32:03.174 --> 00:32:05.090
AMELIA SALTSMAN: So as
you puree this soup,

00:32:05.090 --> 00:32:07.350
if it feels like it's
too thick then you

00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:08.599
can thin it with more--

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:09.640
JENNA TAYLOR: More stock.

00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.640
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Mm-hmm.

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:14.136
[BLENDER GRINDING]

00:32:34.064 --> 00:32:34.564
Yeah.

00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:42.720
JENNA TAYLOR: Consistency-wise--
this one is much thicker.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.272
Which are we going for?

00:32:44.272 --> 00:32:46.230
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well,
somewhere in between-- I

00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:48.217
haven't finished
pureeing this one.

00:32:48.217 --> 00:32:49.300
So this one I'd probably--

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:49.490
JENNA TAYLOR: Little
bit more stock?

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.390
AMELIA SALTSMAN: --be
adding more-- right.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:53.050
I would be adding more stuff.

00:32:53.050 --> 00:32:56.410
You can always add more, but
if you start with too much,

00:32:56.410 --> 00:32:58.828
then you have boiled vegetables.

00:32:58.828 --> 00:33:00.250
[LAUGHING]

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:04.042
[BLENDER GRINDING]

00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:07.100
OK.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:13.440
You can do this in a blender--
in a regular stand blender.

00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:16.610
But I'm going to need that
spatula so we can plate this.

00:33:16.610 --> 00:33:18.482
[METAL CLANKING]

00:33:18.482 --> 00:33:19.690
JENNA TAYLOR: Ladle, spatula?

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:20.981
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Ladle-- sorry.

00:33:23.930 --> 00:33:27.620
So now we have our
beautiful soup.

00:33:27.620 --> 00:33:30.287
The thing about
using a stand blender

00:33:30.287 --> 00:33:31.870
is that you have
more to wash, and you

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:33.870
have to wait until the
soup cools off a little.

00:33:33.870 --> 00:33:35.657
You have a little
more-- you don't

00:33:35.657 --> 00:33:36.740
want it to explode on you.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:39.110
So here we go.

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:41.285
Doesn't that just
look like autumn?

00:33:41.285 --> 00:33:42.660
JENNA TAYLOR:
Smells [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:43.576
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:33:43.576 --> 00:33:46.820
And then why don't we drizzle
a little bit on there?

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:51.570
Yeah-- just feel
your inner Picasso.

00:33:51.570 --> 00:33:53.930
Great.

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:55.101
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:56.184
JENNA TAYLOR: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:56.184 --> 00:33:57.445
It's a little excited.

00:33:57.445 --> 00:33:58.820
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
And there we go.

00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:04.640
So this last layer of
flavor has built it

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:07.030
so that it's not the same
as if we had made the soup

00:34:07.030 --> 00:34:09.270
and put it inside.

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.889
It just when we eat it--
which is ready now--

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:15.780
it just adds a lot more magic.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:17.070
And it's not hard to do.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:17.862
And it's so pretty.

00:34:17.862 --> 00:34:18.653
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:34:18.653 --> 00:34:21.650
And I love doing the pesto right
in the jar-- speaking of not

00:34:21.650 --> 00:34:24.431
washing more things or having
a food processor-- my food

00:34:24.431 --> 00:34:26.180
processor has so many
pieces, and then you

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:27.267
have to wash them all.

00:34:27.267 --> 00:34:27.975
That's brilliant.

00:34:27.975 --> 00:34:29.260
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Anyway, so that's it.

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.639
JENNA TAYLOR: And
it looks beautiful.

00:34:30.639 --> 00:34:31.290
AMELIA SALTSMAN: All right.

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:31.940
So here we are.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:32.900
Aren't we clever?

00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:34.010
JENNA TAYLOR: Excellent.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:35.468
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Thank you so much.

00:34:35.468 --> 00:34:37.606
[APPLAUSE]

00:34:39.431 --> 00:34:41.678
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:41.678 --> 00:34:42.469
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:34:42.469 --> 00:34:43.760
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Any questions?

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.810
JENNA TAYLOR: Questions?

00:34:44.810 --> 00:34:46.830
What's the best way to
make vegetable stock?

00:34:46.830 --> 00:34:47.330
Right.

00:34:47.330 --> 00:34:50.050
And make it tasty
because no offense but--

00:34:50.050 --> 00:34:51.933
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Great question.

00:34:51.933 --> 00:34:55.580
So in the book I do have a
recipe for a simple vegetable

00:34:55.580 --> 00:34:56.080
stock.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.200
Two things-- you can
either make it the way

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:03.500
we started the soup-- saute
all the ingredients first

00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:08.400
and add the water in batches.

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:13.350
Again, avoiding the
boiled vegetable taste.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.082
JENNA TAYLOR: So
layer in liquid.

00:35:15.082 --> 00:35:16.040
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Right.

00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:19.520
Add the liquid-- half of the
liquid-- you can add more

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:21.820
and just let it be
very concentrated.

00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:24.000
If you want to take
a little more time,

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.530
our other favorite technique--
roast the vegetables first

00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:30.600
for about 45 minutes, so
you've got some browning.

00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:34.370
It'll make a more robust stock.

00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:37.370
And then start your soup.

00:35:37.370 --> 00:35:43.170
Then put it in a pot and cook
it-- again, adding enough salt

00:35:43.170 --> 00:35:47.739
and allowing it to be
dense with vegetable.

00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:48.530
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.997
What vegetables actually form
your base for your stock?

00:35:50.997 --> 00:35:52.330
AMELIA SALTSMAN: The stock-- OK.

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.140
What are the vegetables
for the stock?

00:35:55.140 --> 00:36:02.480
Certainly onions, carrots,
celery, parsley, and then

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:05.350
leeks, in addition-- which
are not quite the same

00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:06.540
as onions, right?

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:11.180
So adding a sweetness-- keep
those green tops in there.

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:14.000
A piece of butternut
squash is great,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.060
a couple of tomatoes
or sun dried tomatoes

00:36:17.060 --> 00:36:20.966
to give you umami-- that
sort of meaty quality.

00:36:20.966 --> 00:36:22.840
JENNA TAYLOR: Mushroom
[INAUDIBLE] dried or--

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.215
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
I was just going

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.140
to say a few dried mushrooms
would be excellent.

00:36:27.140 --> 00:36:29.950
You can add a lot of things.

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:34.868
You can add pea
tendril tops, pea--

00:36:34.868 --> 00:36:36.170
JENNA TAYLOR: Shoots-- yeah?

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:37.740
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
--shoots and so on.

00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:42.770
But anything that's
very odiferous--

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:45.900
I wouldn't put broccoli
or cauliflower.

00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.670
They're too strong.

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:51.160
If you want to use the
woody ends of asparagus,

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.710
that's fine--
particularly if you're

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.322
making an asparagus
soup-- very flavorful.

00:36:55.322 --> 00:36:56.780
JENNA TAYLOR: Layer
that in, right?

00:36:56.780 --> 00:36:57.310
In the base?

00:36:57.310 --> 00:37:00.280
AMELIA SALTSMAN: But it's
very flavorful so-- but,

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:01.708
yes, lots of vegetables.

00:37:01.708 --> 00:37:03.083
JENNA TAYLOR: So
lots of freedom.

00:37:03.083 --> 00:37:03.695
Riff on it.

00:37:03.695 --> 00:37:04.570
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yes.

00:37:04.570 --> 00:37:07.410
What you have in
the house will work.

00:37:07.410 --> 00:37:08.510
JENNA TAYLOR: The citrus.

00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:09.885
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Isn't that nice?

00:37:09.885 --> 00:37:11.970
It just pops, so you've
got a lot of contrast

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:13.220
in color, flavor, and texture.

00:37:13.220 --> 00:37:14.011
JENNA TAYLOR: Yeah.

00:37:14.011 --> 00:37:16.350
I feel like acid is one
of those elements that

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:19.580
will take a dish next level
and really impress your friends

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:20.360
and family.

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.440
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Just enough acid.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:22.815
JENNA TAYLOR: Just
so that hint--

00:37:22.815 --> 00:37:24.217
that bright hint of acid.

00:37:24.217 --> 00:37:25.800
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Yes, and that is key.

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:28.216
I think that's one of the
things we don't think about when

00:37:28.216 --> 00:37:32.930
we make salads which is we
over dress, we over vinegar,

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:35.100
and we get very complicated.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.590
And if we have
flavorful ingredients,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.090
we should just get
out of their way.

00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.050
JENNA TAYLOR: Simple.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:40.650
Simple.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:42.670
AUDIENCE: How long do
you roast the walnuts?

00:37:42.670 --> 00:37:45.810
JENNA TAYLOR: How long
do you roast walnuts?

00:37:45.810 --> 00:37:48.920
AMELIA SALTSMAN: At 350-- I
would say 5 to 10 minutes.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.570
I would check them after five,
but you really-- probably

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:58.200
at 350, it would probably
take close to 10 minutes.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.520
You want them to be fragrant.

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.060
And when you cut
into one, you should

00:38:03.060 --> 00:38:05.100
see a little bit of color.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:10.150
They will continue to cook
from their own residual heat.

00:38:10.150 --> 00:38:11.330
They have a lot of oil.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:13.660
So once you take
them out of the oven,

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:16.180
they're going to
continue to brown.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:19.230
And you want them to have
color but not to be dark.

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:21.930
JENNA TAYLOR: I almost
always burn the first batch.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.340
It's one of those tasks--
you can't get distracted when

00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:27.530
you're doing it because it'll
go from perfect to yucky

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:28.330
in about a second.

00:38:28.330 --> 00:38:29.630
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And I
like to do it in the oven.

00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:31.520
I think you have
the most control.

00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:34.790
And I think also you have--

00:38:34.790 --> 00:38:36.780
JENNA TAYLOR: --surface
area exposed to heat.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:37.280
Yeah.

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:37.575
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Exactly.

00:38:37.575 --> 00:38:38.075
Exactly.

00:38:38.075 --> 00:38:39.920
And that's really a
key for any roasting.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.580
One of the things we should
talk about-- size matters.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:47.571
So you noticed we
used a wide pot.

00:38:47.571 --> 00:38:49.820
So when you have wide, you
have a lot of surface area.

00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:51.750
You have a lot of
evaporation and a lot

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:53.780
of flavor concentration.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:55.530
When you're making
the vegetable stock

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:57.230
and you want to have
a lot of liquid,

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:59.880
a deeper pot is
usually more helpful.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.660
Same thing when you're
roasting vegetables.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.780
Nice, big-- those
half sheet pans

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.840
we were using--
your best friend.

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:11.355
And leave room--
if you pile them

00:39:11.355 --> 00:39:13.480
one on top of the other--
the vegetables one on top

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.670
of the other, you're
going to steam them.

00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:20.050
So in the "Santa Monica
Farmers' Market Cookbook,"

00:39:20.050 --> 00:39:24.820
I actually wrote an entire four
page roasting vegetable primer.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.030
JENNA TAYLOR: Love it.

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.030
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Because
it's the same technique

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:31.080
but each vegetable
sometimes has a little bit--

00:39:33.584 --> 00:39:34.750
JENNA TAYLOR: Little tweaks.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:37.520
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Little tweaks--
they have their own nature.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:44.010
For instance, certain
dense vegetables that are

00:39:44.010 --> 00:39:47.170
fibrous like
cauliflower or broccoli.

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.760
I think they're
better if you blanch

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:52.080
them first-- so to boil
them in salted water

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.800
for a couple of minutes.

00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.190
It might seem like
an extra step,

00:39:56.190 --> 00:40:01.920
but the result is going to
be tender yet crisp and not

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:04.102
dry and chewy.

00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:04.810
So it's worth it.

00:40:04.810 --> 00:40:07.220
And you can do that
step a day or two ahead,

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:08.954
and then you have
convenience food.

00:40:08.954 --> 00:40:11.120
JENNA TAYLOR: Didn't even
think of that-- brilliant.

00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:11.380
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Yeah.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:12.450
Food literacy.

00:40:12.450 --> 00:40:13.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.410
JENNA TAYLOR: Learn
something every single time.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:18.030
Oh, beautiful
question-- what did you

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:19.571
discover about
yourself when you were

00:40:19.571 --> 00:40:21.290
writing this book
despite how you've

00:40:21.290 --> 00:40:23.880
been cooking for forever?

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:29.030
AMELIA SALTSMAN: Well, it really
was an extraordinary journey.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:31.450
I have been cooking
the seasonal way,

00:40:31.450 --> 00:40:35.770
teaching, and hoping to
help people learn that as we

00:40:35.770 --> 00:40:38.490
struggle through
our busy lives--

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:41.980
that supporting our local
farmers and cooking this way

00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.830
is the answer to a whole lot.

00:40:44.830 --> 00:40:47.930
And when I started looking
through the lens of how

00:40:47.930 --> 00:40:50.480
I cook for the
Jewish holidays, I

00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.010
realized I didn't change my
approach to all that we've just

00:40:55.010 --> 00:40:57.270
been talking about today.

00:40:57.270 --> 00:41:01.380
And I thought,
oh, wait a minute.

00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:03.160
There's something here.

00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:08.330
And as I started to explore,
I really realized-- I mean,

00:41:08.330 --> 00:41:11.900
I understood that I had
access to seasonal ingredients

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.357
for those particular holidays.

00:41:14.357 --> 00:41:15.940
I don't know how
many of you celebrate

00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:22.170
any of the Jewish holidays, but
it was more than just, oh, yes.

00:41:22.170 --> 00:41:24.110
They're in season now.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:30.440
I began to see how the
synchronicity of what

00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.410
we do seasonally,
and sustainably,

00:41:32.410 --> 00:41:37.230
and how the ancient lessons
are-- they're already there

00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:40.240
in-- I reread "The Bible"
for agriculture and food.

00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:40.990
JENNA TAYLOR: Wow.

00:41:40.990 --> 00:41:42.960
AMELIA SALTSMAN: And
it's all right there.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.750
And having nothing
to do with religion

00:41:45.750 --> 00:41:52.750
but having to do with history,
and reading, and remembering we

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:55.350
didn't invent
everything yesterday.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:56.860
And sometimes it's
good to remember.

00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:57.940
JENNA TAYLOR: Absolutely.

00:41:57.940 --> 00:41:59.356
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
And what happened

00:41:59.356 --> 00:42:04.900
is that it expanded that
sense that I already

00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:10.170
had of being grateful to
the farmers who grow my food

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:16.170
and expanding that to
an even greater degree--

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:19.060
that "The Seasonal
Jewish Kitchen, A Fresh

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:25.440
Take on Tradition" is really
about a global patchwork

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:30.180
of really interesting
regional cuisines.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:33.180
Jewish or not,
people tend to think

00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:39.320
that Jewish cooking is deli, you
know, matzah ball soup-- things

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.510
like that.

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:41.700
But it's so much more.

00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.370
It's an entire world of food.

00:42:44.370 --> 00:42:50.590
And the European tradition that
we know so well in this country

00:42:50.590 --> 00:42:53.360
is just one aspect.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:43:00.030
And I really wanted to just
open up that box-- that way

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.310
of thinking.

00:43:01.310 --> 00:43:03.830
And I hope you'll take a
look and enjoy the book.

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:04.830
JENNA TAYLOR: All right.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:07.520
Well, thank you all for
being here with us today.

00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.854
Thank you so much for your time.

00:43:08.854 --> 00:43:10.394
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
Well, and thank you.

00:43:10.394 --> 00:43:11.790
I had a great time cooking.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.065
JENNA TAYLOR: Oh, me, too.

00:43:12.065 --> 00:43:12.340
Me, too.

00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:14.586
Absolutely-- hopefully, you'll
come back and see us again.

00:43:14.586 --> 00:43:15.040
AMELIA SALTSMAN:
I would love to.

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:15.873
JENNA TAYLOR: Great.

00:43:15.873 --> 00:43:18.740
[APPLAUSE]
