00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
To solve this problem, I broke it up into two parts.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's think of this section where we're accelerating first then calculate how far we go.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, this is the equation I want to use and so I know I'm looking for Δx.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And I know the initial velocity is 0, and the time is 4 s for this first part of the question,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and the acceleration will be 3.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
When I carry out this math, I find that I covered a distance of 24 m in the first 4 s.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
But I want to go 96 m, so I still have 72 m left to go at a constant speed of 12 m/s.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Well, I can use the same exact equation, but now I know Δx and not the time.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
So notice that now I've used an initial velocity of 12.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Even though my first problem started with an initial velocity of 0, I've broken it up.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
So the second smaller subproblem has an initial velocity of 12 and no acceleration.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So this term goes to 0. I can solve this and find that t = 6 s.

00:00:47.000 --> 99:59:59.000
And I have to add that to my original 4 s, so it takes me 10 s to complete this race.
