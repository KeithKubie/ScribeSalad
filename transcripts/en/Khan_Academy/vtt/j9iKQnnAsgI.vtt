00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.020
We are on problem number six.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.760
If there is no waste, how many
square yards of carpeting is

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.960
needed to cover a rectangular
floor that is

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.460
12 feet by 18 feet?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.700
So I can just draw
it like that.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.170
And it's 12 feet by 18 feet.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.660
And the trick here is, they're
not asking how many feet,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.140
they're asking how many square
yards of carpeting.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.510
So the easiest thing to do
really at this point, is to

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.640
convert the dimensions
of the room to yards.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.040
And they tell us 3
feet make a yard.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.800
So 18 feet, that's the
same thing as what?

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.720
Divide by 3, and you get,
that's 6 yards.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.020
6 yards is 18 feet.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.500
And you divide by 3,
you get 4 yards.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.860
I always find the arithmetic
the hardest part.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.530
4 yards is equal to
12 feet, right?

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.500
4 times 3 is equal to 12.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.090
So now this is a 6 by 4, so 6
yards times 4 yards is equal

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.129
to 24 square yards.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.740
That's choice C.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.940
And the mistake, if you got
this wrong, you might have

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.610
just-- well one, you might have
multiplied 12 times 18

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.520
and gotten a very large
number and said,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.180
oh, that's the answer.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.820
But then your answer would've
been in feet.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910
Then the other mistake you might
have done is you might

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.550
have multiplied 12 times 18--
you might done this, 12 times

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.270
18 divided by 3.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.100
Because you said, oh well, 3
feet is equal to a yard.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.860
And that is a mistake because
you're now converting square

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.150
feet to square yards.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.790
And it's actually-- you should
have divided by 9 because

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.410
there's actually 9 square
feet per square yard.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:43.090
Why is that?

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.560
Because if I had-- let's
say this is a 1

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.060
square yard, right?

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.700
That means it's going to be
3 feet on that side, 3

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.490
feet on that side.

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.640
So it's actually
9 square feet.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.770
So if you figured out the area
in feet first, you had to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.450
divide by 9, not by 3.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.630
That probably was the most
common mistake, assuming that

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.640
you realized that you had
to convert units.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.890
Next problem.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.990
Problem seven.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.550
A certain scale only registers
weights that are

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.290
greater than 6 pounds.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.540
OK, fair enough.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.680
A person who wanted to know
the weights of a puppy, a

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.210
kitten and a bunny-- very cute--
weighed them in pairs

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.720
and got the following results.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.010
Kitten plus bunny weighed
7 pounds.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.376
Kitten plus puppy is 8.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.230
And bunny plus puppy is 9.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.700
This is by far the cutest
problem I've ever done.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.640
What is the weight
of the puppy?

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.180
So we want to solve for P.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.460
Well, if we're going to solve
for P, the best thing we could

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.730
do is we want to use these
two equations.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.350
But we have three-- if we just
look at these two equations,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.780
we have three unknowns
with two equations.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.460
So let's use this equation to
substitute into this equation.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.370
So let's say we want
to replace this K.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.970
So we can use this top equation
to say that K is

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.240
equal to 7 minus B.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.530
So if we substitute that into
this equation, we'll get-- so

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.720
let me just-- this is 7 minus
B, so we'll get 7 minus B--

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.600
and I'm just rewriting this top
equation, that's this--

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.850
plus P is equal to 8.

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.480
And then this bottom equation
still is B plus

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.450
P is equal to 9.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.410
I could add the 7 or subtract
7 from both sides right now,

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.900
but I'm just going to actually
add the equations, because I

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.090
like how these B's are
going to cancel out.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.820
I get excited about canceling
variables.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.000
So-- actually, no let me
subtract 7 from both sides

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900
first. So if we take 7 from
here, than this 8

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.860
becomes a 1, right?

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.760
I just subtracted 7
from both sides.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.740
So negative B plus
P is equal to 1.

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.420
Now I just add these
two equations.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:08.550
And what's minus B plus B?

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.680
It's 0 plus P plus P is 2P is
equal to 1 plus 9 is 10.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.100
2P equals 10.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.950
P is equal to 5.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.730
Choice D.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.530
5 pounds, that's how much
the puppy weighs.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.430
Which shows us the bunny weighs
2 pounds, and the

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.450
kitten weighs 3 pounds.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.520
Which is-- it looks like they
actually thought about how

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.450
much a puppy, a bunny and a
kitten would actually weigh,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.960
which I have to give
them credit for.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.570
Next problem.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.520
Problem eight.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.490
On a blueprint, 1/4
inch represents 16

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.730
feet in real life.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.510
If a driveway is 40 feet long,
what is its length in inches

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.890
on the map?

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:59.850
So a driveway-- that's a
driveway, I don't know, that's

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.260
my driveway.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.890
And it's 40 feet long.

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.460
So how many of these units
is it going to be?

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.880
Well, actually-- we could do it
a bunch of different ways.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.530
We could say 1/4 of an inch
is equal to 16 feet.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.500
If we multiply both sides of
this relationship by 4, you

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.910
get 1 inch is equal
to 64 feet.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.226
1 inch-- I just multiplied
both sides of this

00:05:34.226 --> 00:05:35.930
relationship by 4.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.930
So if you want to figure out
how many inches this would

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.640
represent, you would say, well,
x is how many inches it

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.730
would represent over 1 inch
is equal to this length,

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:52.050
40 feet, over 64.

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.790
It's the same fraction.

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.360
And of course, if you divide
by 1, this cancels out.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.250
So you're left with x, which
is its representation in

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.950
inches, is equal to 40/64.

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.020
Well you could divide the top
and the bottom by 8, so that

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.880
becomes 5/8.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.220
40 divided by 5.

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.840
64 divided by 8.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.140
x is equal to 5/8.

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.970
And that is choice B.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:21.820
Next problem.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:22.900
There's a bunch of ways you
could have don e it.

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.090
This is the way that
occurred to me.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:31.590
Next problem, problem nine.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:36.140
In the xy-coordinate system, p
comma 0 is one of the points

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.840
of intersection of the graphs--
OK, so they're giving

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.150
us two graphs.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:45.360
y is equal to minus x squared
plus 9, and the other graph is

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.120
y is equal to x squared
minus 9.

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:58.950
If p is positive, what
is the value of p?

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:00.360
So they're saying that the
coordinate where they

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:03.970
intersect is p comma 0.

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.115
So we want to figure out the

00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:10.320
x-coordinate where they intersect.

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.650
So the easy way-- you know,
they're tempting you to add

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.090
these equations and do all sorts
of things, but we know

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.260
that they intersect at the
point y is equal to 0.

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:21.050
They're telling us that, so we
don't have to do all this

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:21.590
fancy stuff.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.470
We don't have to figure out
where they intersect.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.060
They tell us it intersects
at y equals 0.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:29.190
So y equals 0, what's x in
either of these situations?

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:31.030
Well, let's take this
second equation.

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.020
0 is equal to x squared
minus 9.

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.280
Add 9 to both sides, you get
x squared is equal to 9.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.400
I added 9 and switched
the sides.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.680
You get x is equal to
plus or minus 3.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.350
And they tell us, that if
p is positive, what is

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:49.530
the value of p?

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:52.180
Well, it has to be
plus 3 then.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.160
And that is choice A.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.390
And you could have used
the top equation.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.390
You could have said 0 is equal
to negative x squared plus 9.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:01.200
You would've gotten
the same thing.

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.600
You would've gotten x squared
is equal to 9, x is equal to

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.120
plus or minus 3.

00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.080
You would've gotten the
same thing either way.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:09.150
Next problem.

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:10.053
I don't know if I'm going
to have time to

00:08:10.053 --> 00:08:10.840
do it in this video.

00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:13.930
I might have to do
it in the next.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.370
Problem ten.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:19.540
The Smith Metal Company's
old machine makes

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.100
300 bolts per hour.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.610
300-- I'll call it b per h.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:30.220
Its new machine makes
450 bolts per hour.

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:34.890
If both machines begin running
at the same time, how many

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:38.880
minutes will it take the
two machines to make a

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.539
total of 900 bolts?

00:08:41.539 --> 00:08:42.220
So how many minutes?

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.120
So let's say m for minutes.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.480
So the total number of bolts
they're going to produce-- so

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:56.380
bolts is going to be equal--
so this is per hour, right?

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.790
These are both per hour.

00:08:57.790 --> 00:09:01.400
So let's figure it out minutes,
because they're

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:03.420
asking us how many minutes
will it take.

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.860
So if you make 300 bolts in an
hour, you're going to make

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:08.740
1/60 that in a minute.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:11.920
So what's 1/60 of 300?

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.910
Well, 300 divided by 60
is 5 bolts per minute.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:23.390
And this one-- what's
450 divided by 60?

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.340
Actually, I'm going to
run out of time.

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:25.590
I'm going to do this problem
in the next video.

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.320
I'll see you soon.
