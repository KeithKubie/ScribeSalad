00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.920
It's exciting, actually.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.520
VIC GUNDOTRA: On behalf of
Google, welcome to the Sixth

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.830
Annual Google I/O.

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.400
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.030
VIC GUNDOTRA: It's really
not about us.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.040
It's about you, developers,
who are building the most

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.050
amazing and magical experiences
that make those

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.470
platforms and services
come alive.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.770
MALE SPEAKER: I always walk
away inspired to do more.

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.650
MALE SPEAKER: Welcome
back to Google

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.590
Developers Live at I/O 2013.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.060
SUNDAR PICHAI: We are in the
middle of one of the most

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.840
pivotal moments in personal
computing.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.120
At the heart of this journey is
the impact we can have on

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.590
people around the world.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:09.080
Android started with a simple
goal of bringing open

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.400
standards to the mobile
industry.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.980
Today, it is the most popular
mobile operating

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.600
system in the world.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.910
HUGH BARRA: Google Play
has just crossed

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.060
48 billion app installs.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.100
AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE]

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.980
HUGH BARRA: We're here to show
that we're listening.

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:31.560
And we're here because we really
want you to thrive.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.980
Today we're announcing a new
family of APIs built

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.690
specifically for game
developers, not only on

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.080
Android, but also for iOS
and web, so you can have

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.615
cross-platform gaming
experiences, which I think is

00:01:44.615 --> 00:01:47.600
pretty cool.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.500
TOR NORBYE: So what if I want to
know what this layout looks

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.650
like on different
screen sizes?

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.900
Let's take a look.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.700
ELLIE POWERS: We're now
going to use our new

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.690
app translation service.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.655
Professional translations
directly in

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:02.980
the developer console.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.600
SUNDAR PICHAI: Chrome started
as a simple journey to make

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.740
the web much better, both as a
platform for developers, and

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.896
as an experience for users.

00:02:12.896 --> 00:02:15.010
LINUS UPSON: A browser's
a means, not an end.

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.310
And so we're always trying to
figure out how to make the

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.560
browser smaller and faster.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.660
SUNDAR PICHAI: Our goal with the
pixel was to get it in the

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.330
hands of developers, so that
they can build the next

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.460
generation of web experiences.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.250
MALE SPEAKER: On the floor,
I think the best thing was

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.980
always being able to talk
to the engineers.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.400
FEMALE SPEAKER: Everything
is very, very exciting.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.760
MALE SPEAKER: Google is
innovating at such a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.990
blistering speed,
it's incredible.

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.100
MALE SPEAKER: If you are
actively involved or very

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.940
interested in anything that
Google does, this is where you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.190
need to be.

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.750
VIC GUNDOTRA: We're introducing
41 new features

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.580
across three major
areas of Google+.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.320
A newly designed stream, a new
hang outs application, and a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.245
fundamentally new photos
experience.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.720
CHRIS YERGA: Today I'm happy to
announce Google Play Music

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.540
All Access, a uniquely Google
approach to a subscription

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.280
music service.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.766
JONAH JONES: This is the
new Google Maps.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:31.300
BERNI SEEFELD: And
those clouds?

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.330
They're real time.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.150
Let's take a closer look.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.950
No plug-ins, no downloads.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.720
AMIT SINGHAL: A computer you can
talk to and it will answer

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.420
everything you ask it?

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.130
JOHANNA WRIGHT: OK, Google,
show me things

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.050
to do in Santa Cruz.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.880
SIRI: Here are popular
attractions in Santa Cruz.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.960
JOHANNA WRIGHT: Show
me my pictures from

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.195
New York last year.

00:03:59.195 --> 00:04:02.120
AMIT SINGHAL: With the simple
touch of a mic, from the Queen

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.370
of England to the most common
farmer in Africa, everyone can

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.450
easily access all of humanity's
information.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.426
LARRY PAGE: The opportunities
we have are tremendous.

00:04:14.426 --> 00:04:17.430
You know, we haven't seen this
rate of change in computing

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.366
since the birth of personal
computers.

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:23.690
I think we're all here because
we share a deep sense of

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.340
optimism about the potential
of technology to improve

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.440
people's lives and the world.
