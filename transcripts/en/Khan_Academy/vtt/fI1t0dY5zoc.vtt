00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:02.172
- [Instructor] Before we dive deep

00:00:02.172 --> 00:00:04.437
into our study of government and politics,

00:00:04.437 --> 00:00:06.750
it's worth asking a fundamental question.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.077
And that's whether we
even need government,

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:12.107
or why do we need government?

00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:13.838
And I encourage you to pause this video

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:14.887
and think about this.

00:00:14.887 --> 00:00:16.492
Do you think we need government, and why?

00:00:16.492 --> 00:00:19.637
Or do you think we don't
need government, and why?

00:00:19.637 --> 00:00:22.231
Okay, now let's start to reason
through this a little bit

00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:24.627
and start to think about the benefits

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:26.872
or the pitfalls of a government.

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:30.194
So let's say that we are in
a world without a government.

00:00:30.194 --> 00:00:31.970
And this is me right over here.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.792
And at first, it sounds pretty good.

00:00:33.792 --> 00:00:36.011
I have unlimited rights here.

00:00:36.011 --> 00:00:37.767
There's no one infringing on my right.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:39.405
I can say what I want.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.238
I have the freest possible speech.

00:00:43.148 --> 00:00:44.739
There are no laws that I could break.

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.739
I have the freest possible religion.

00:00:48.794 --> 00:00:51.047
I have no government
telling me what to practice

00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:52.794
or what I can't practice.

00:00:52.794 --> 00:00:54.456
I have,

00:00:54.456 --> 00:00:57.104
I can own what I want.

00:00:57.104 --> 00:00:58.240
I have property.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.274
I can go anywhere,

00:01:00.274 --> 00:01:01.857
so I have movement.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.997
And I also have some freedoms

00:01:04.997 --> 00:01:06.831
that those of us who live in a government

00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:08.629
don't typically have.

00:01:08.629 --> 00:01:11.462
So I would have the freedom to tax

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.354
others or to take from others,

00:01:16.354 --> 00:01:18.230
take property.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:19.761
If I'm stronger than them,

00:01:19.761 --> 00:01:21.781
or if I'm just sneakier,
I go in the middle night,

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.775
I can just take their property from them.

00:01:23.775 --> 00:01:26.436
I could just settle on their land.

00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:30.564
I could have the freedom to punish others

00:01:30.564 --> 00:01:33.752
or imprison others if I don't like 'em.

00:01:33.752 --> 00:01:35.376
It doesn't even have to be for a reason.

00:01:35.376 --> 00:01:38.004
This is a freedom that
most of us don't have

00:01:38.004 --> 00:01:39.386
in the world that we live in today.

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:42.203
But without a government,
I would have this freedom,

00:01:42.203 --> 00:01:44.660
this freedom to go and
take stuff from others

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.459
and to do physical harm or
imprison them or enslave them.

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.179
Now, this might sound good
to you as an individual,

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.367
but remember everyone in
this government-less society

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.817
would have these same,

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:01.267
would have these same freedoms.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:04.668
And I especially like the
ability to have my own property

00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:07.947
and to have my own freedom of movement.

00:02:07.947 --> 00:02:10.326
But what if this person right over here

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:12.788
doesn't like me to have
freedom of movement?

00:02:12.788 --> 00:02:14.818
And so they say they're
going to invoke, look,

00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.911
I can punish or imprison you
because I don't like you.

00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.237
And so they're going to infringe

00:02:19.237 --> 00:02:21.489
on my freedom of movement
by imprisoning me,

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.029
or maybe I might do it to someone else.

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:27.776
And so even though you
have all of these freedoms,

00:02:27.776 --> 00:02:31.434
because everyone else does,
especially these latter few,

00:02:31.434 --> 00:02:33.489
they might be able to take
some of these from you,

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.841
including your freedom to live,
your health, your happiness.

00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:42.331
And this is well-described
in political philosophy.

00:02:42.331 --> 00:02:44.483
In particular, you have a gentleman

00:02:44.483 --> 00:02:46.248
by the name of Thomas Hobbes,

00:02:46.248 --> 00:02:49.034
who's considered one of the
fathers of political philosophy.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:53.201
And this is what he had to say
about this state of nature.

00:02:54.502 --> 00:02:57.690
"As long as men live
without a common power

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.285
"to keep them all in awe,

00:03:00.285 --> 00:03:02.945
"they are in the condition known as war,

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:07.226
"and it is a war of every
man against every man.

00:03:07.226 --> 00:03:09.868
"In war, the two chief virtues

00:03:09.868 --> 00:03:11.701
"are force and fraud."

00:03:12.663 --> 00:03:14.769
I can do something by physical force,

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:15.839
or I could trick you,

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.079
or I could sneak around you
and take something from you,

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.426
or imprison you.

00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:21.468
"A further fact about the state of war

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.839
"of every man against every man,

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:26.455
"in it there is no such
thing as ownership,

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:30.210
"no legal control, no distinction
between mine and thine,"

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.870
between mine and yours.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.600
"Rather, anything that
a man can get is his

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.320
"for as long as he can keep it.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.328
"In such a condition, every
man has a right to everything,

00:03:41.328 --> 00:03:44.069
"even to someone else's body.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.903
"As long as this continues, therefore,

00:03:46.903 --> 00:03:49.175
"that is, as long as every man continues

00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:52.317
"to have this natural right to everything,

00:03:52.317 --> 00:03:55.632
"no man, however strong
or clever he may be,

00:03:55.632 --> 00:03:57.936
"can be sure of living out the time

00:03:57.936 --> 00:04:01.422
"that nature ordinarily
allows men to live."

00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:05.589
This was written in Leviathan,
which was published in 1651.

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:08.475
So he's framing the same thing.

00:04:08.475 --> 00:04:10.410
If everyone has a right to everything,

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.280
well, they can infringe on other people,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.336
including their life, their
health, their happiness,

00:04:15.336 --> 00:04:17.965
their freedom to movement.

00:04:17.965 --> 00:04:19.728
Now some of you might
be skeptical of this.

00:04:19.728 --> 00:04:22.223
You might say, look, humans
are fundamentally good.

00:04:22.223 --> 00:04:24.818
If you give 'em that freedom,
they have a conscience.

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.999
They're not going to try
to do this to other people.

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:31.263
But some of you might be
able to cite times in society

00:04:31.263 --> 00:04:33.013
where there's more of an anarchy

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:34.789
where actually people might devolve.

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:36.585
And even if one or two or three,

00:04:36.585 --> 00:04:39.318
or even if a majority of
the people have a conscience

00:04:39.318 --> 00:04:41.608
and aren't willing to imprison others

00:04:41.608 --> 00:04:43.848
and punish people arbitrarily,

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:45.823
if even a few people are not willing

00:04:45.823 --> 00:04:47.765
to respect other people's rights,

00:04:47.765 --> 00:04:49.647
everything might devolve.

00:04:49.647 --> 00:04:52.478
And it's worth talking about
the historical context here

00:04:52.478 --> 00:04:56.560
because this was near the
end of the English Civil War,

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.066
where there was chaos,

00:04:58.066 --> 00:04:59.954
where people were asking these questions.

00:04:59.954 --> 00:05:02.234
Well, what type of
government should we have?

00:05:02.234 --> 00:05:04.201
And when there isn't a strong government,

00:05:04.201 --> 00:05:08.336
all of this chaos is really
all about person versus person.

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:11.757
It wasn't this degree of chaos
that Hobbes is writing about,

00:05:11.757 --> 00:05:14.081
this kind of natural
state without government,

00:05:14.081 --> 00:05:16.774
but this was a context where
there was a lot of bloodshed,

00:05:16.774 --> 00:05:19.514
a lot of war, and a lot of chaos.

00:05:19.514 --> 00:05:21.287
Now, Hobbes had a solution,

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:24.469
and this is actually why the
book was called Leviathan.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:29.453
He was an advocate of a very
strong central government.

00:05:29.453 --> 00:05:33.300
This keeps people in awe alludes
to what he's thinking of.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.031
Leviathan comes from the Old
Testament or the Hebrew Bible.

00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:39.124
It's the name of a sea monster.

00:05:39.124 --> 00:05:42.565
But Hobbes thinks that a
government should be a Leviathan

00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:44.433
to keep everyone in check.

00:05:44.433 --> 00:05:45.266
He wrote,

00:05:46.217 --> 00:05:49.962
"When a man thinks that peace
and self-defense require it,

00:05:49.962 --> 00:05:53.118
"he should be willing,
when others are too,

00:05:53.118 --> 00:05:55.920
"to lay down his right to everything,

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.166
"and should be contented

00:05:57.166 --> 00:05:59.965
"with as much liberty against other men

00:05:59.965 --> 00:06:04.165
"as he would allow other
men against himself."

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:06.582
Now, this idea that he's talking about,

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:09.082
this is today referred to as a

00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:12.200
social contract.

00:06:13.284 --> 00:06:15.159
And this term social contract

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.536
is first formally used by Rousseau,

00:06:17.536 --> 00:06:19.262
another Enlightenment author,

00:06:19.262 --> 00:06:21.670
about a hundred years later,

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.291
talking about this willingness
to give up some rights

00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.948
in order to protect the ones

00:06:26.948 --> 00:06:29.070
that you really, really,
really want to have.

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:30.941
And you would be giving up those rights

00:06:30.941 --> 00:06:33.220
to some form of a government.

00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:36.653
That is the social
contract between the people

00:06:36.653 --> 00:06:40.397
that are governed and the
government that governs them.

00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:42.814
So going back to that previous example

00:06:42.814 --> 00:06:46.215
where every person was out for themselves,

00:06:46.215 --> 00:06:48.478
what the social contract is saying is,

00:06:48.478 --> 00:06:51.353
well, look, certain of these
rights, I really want to keep,

00:06:51.353 --> 00:06:53.220
my freedom of speech,
my freedom of property,

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.758
my freedom to move around,
my freedom to have my life,

00:06:57.758 --> 00:06:59.414
my health, my happiness.

00:06:59.414 --> 00:07:01.402
In order to protect those freedoms,

00:07:01.402 --> 00:07:05.904
maybe I'm willing to give
some of my other freedoms over

00:07:05.904 --> 00:07:07.759
to a central authority,

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:11.345
as long as everyone is
willing to give these up.

00:07:11.345 --> 00:07:13.900
And this central authority
that we give it up to

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:15.233
is a government.

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:18.495
And the government, because it has this,

00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:22.558
it uses these rights in order
to protect the other rights,

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:24.961
the ones that I really want to keep.

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.338
So the government enforces
these other rights,

00:07:27.338 --> 00:07:29.365
and that's the social contract.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.578
I give away these rights

00:07:31.578 --> 00:07:34.231
in order to protect the ones

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:36.537
that I really, really care about.

00:07:36.537 --> 00:07:37.845
And that makes sense,

00:07:37.845 --> 00:07:40.665
but it still leaves a
very, very big question.

00:07:40.665 --> 00:07:44.097
What form should this government take?

00:07:44.097 --> 00:07:46.523
I'm willing to engage
in this social contract,

00:07:46.523 --> 00:07:48.734
but how does this government govern?

00:07:48.734 --> 00:07:50.939
How are the leaders selected?

00:07:50.939 --> 00:07:53.541
What are the constraints
on that government?

00:07:53.541 --> 00:07:55.390
And that will be our focus

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:58.390
as we study government and politics.
