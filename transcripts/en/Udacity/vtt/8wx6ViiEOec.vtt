00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.540
So for me,

00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:06.510
as an entrepreneur, what are the type of
design types that I need to care about?

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.650
&gt;&gt; So
my specialty is interaction design,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.060
so as you've probably guessed from
me saying task, task, task over and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.510
over again for the last few minutes,
that's where I bias towards.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.870
So kind of we focus on trying to
understand users and behaviors.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:23.020
Think about the types of things
that they want to do, and

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.580
how to best fulfill them.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.410
Now that's just one of
the specializations.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.780
There's many.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.810
Other very common ones
are visual design.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.430
They focus on everything

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.880
that the user sees while they're
engaging with your experience.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.450
&gt;&gt; Is there like, colors,
and stuff like that, or?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.530
&gt;&gt; Colors is one, but it's also
things like layout, like scale,

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.840
any iconography that's there,
everything from fonts and

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.050
upward, anything that becomes
a pixel in that piece of software.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.250
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; Visual design

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.960
tries to concentrate on that.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.900
And there's thousands of small
decisions that go into that,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.310
that is their specialization.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.350
Then there's also things
like motion design.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.600
This is a newer focus for
design in many cases.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.240
And they're concerned with how
anything animates, big or small.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.380
To give the user a sense that
their feedback is being heard, and

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.180
that the system's responding to it.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.215
And just to kind of bring
the product to life a little bit.

00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:23.705
They make it feel like it's something
they're really kind of engaging in

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:25.215
this push and pull way.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:28.215
&gt;&gt; You can also stress things
with animation, right?

00:01:28.215 --> 00:01:29.105
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:32.275
Animation is a great way to
tell the user where their

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:35.435
attention should be
focused at any given time.

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.225
And then there's other specializations.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:42.240
There's things like Industrial design,
the design of physical objects.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.440
&gt;&gt; Right.
&gt;&gt; There's sound design, there's brand,

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.180
or print design, and so
on and so on and so on.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.860
Anything that you're doing
on this product that has

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.740
some decision that needs to be made,
there's probably

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.030
a whole discipline of design that
can help you make that decision.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.220
&gt;&gt; So what you're basically telling me
is that I need to hire eight people?

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.830
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.040
Wait, no, no.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.960
You can get by with fewer.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So I know most small teams just don't

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.730
have that capacity to hire
out all the specializations.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.900
So the good news is that, in my
experience, most designers are hybrids.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.220
They might identify as being one of
those specializations, but they often

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.560
have familiarity to varying degrees
with the other fields of the discipline.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.370
So what's important to
keep in mind when you hire

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.810
is kind of have a sense of what
your expectations are going to be.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.660
What are you going to need
out of this designer?

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.020
Do you need interaction and visual?

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.000
Do they need to work on your brand for
you?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.376
And make sure that the capabilities
are in the people that you hire.

00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:50.976
Or, make sure that they are comfortable
directing the work of contractors who

00:02:50.976 --> 00:02:54.819
might be able to kind of augment
the capabilities that they lack.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.510
&gt;&gt; How do they know if they're any good?

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.930
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Wow, that's a good question.

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:05.250
I think the best way to judge
a designer is from their work.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.990
So you should certainly ask for
work samples.

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.630
You should look for the portfolio.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.370
You should find out what kind of
things get them excited about design.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.680
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.060
&gt;&gt; Are they very focused on the user and
on simplicity?

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.800
Are they a designer who can come in and
give more pizzazz, a little sex appeal,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.970
a little gloss to the product?

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.640
There's appeal to having all those
types of people involved with the work.
